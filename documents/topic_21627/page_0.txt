I have created a canister whose `main` function outputs a million of `"X\n"`.

Now every time when I run `dfx start`, my screen is cluttered with Xs.

I tried to remove `.dfx` dirs, reboot, check that no `.dfx` dirs were created. But this does not help.

Where is the state recorded and how to stop this process?
