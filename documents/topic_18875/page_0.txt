Is [this proposal](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/55) and the ICRC1 accounts (it actually account + principle) textual representation is up to date? There is also [some methods](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/packages/ledger/src/utils/ledger.utils.ts#L29) to work with it. If not how we should encode/decode the address?

These links are not up-to-date with the current status, they use temporary encoding. There was literally a ledger and tokenization group meeting this Tuesday (2 days ago) in which the ICRC1 identifier representation was finalized.

@roman-kashitsyn is working on the spec in this PR [https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/98](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/pull/98). Review, info, etc. will follow afterwards.
