Congratulations on the release of the new developer doc site, as others have said it really is :fire:

I wanted to create this thread as a central place for developers to post bugs related to the new developer doc site (formatting or other bugs) for two reasons.

1. So it's easy for the DFINITY doc site team to aggregate and address each of the issues.
2. So Diego doesn't have to waste his time viewing and answering 50 messages in his Twitter inbox from me (he reads them all, thanks @diegop).

Some of the links from the DFINITY corp site to the developer doc site may be broken

Also, all my bookmarked documentation links got broken (new website url structure), so I had to in an update them all. 

Would be nice if this didn't happen every upgrade, or that redirects are built in so that the old version of the page will redirect to the new version (in the future).

Out of curiosity, why was the url file structure changed to
[https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/developer-docs/ic-overview](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/developer-docs/ic-overview)? Why the addition of "current", is there going to be a /develop or /staging path as well? Also, why the renaming of all of the old folder paths?

Found a bug in how the markdown is rendering on this page 

See https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#interface-overview


It's resulting in each of the Interface Overview methods not showing up on the right hand side glossary


Also found a formatting bug here https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#method-arguments

Next to the bullet points in this section the backtick `` code formatting is off for some of them.

The goal is to checkpoint the documentation every so often so that the documentation for older versions of e.g. dfx are still available. IDK how far on the roadmap that is, but that's the reasoning behind it.

Good catch, thanks! 27 occurrences over the whole repo. Some auto-conversion must have screwed it up... PR to change it is in review.

From [https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#http-read-state](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#http-read-state), clicking on "the system state tree" takes you to this link [https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#the-system-state-tree](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#the-system-state-tree) which seems to be broken.
