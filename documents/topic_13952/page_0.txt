In last week [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-dapp-canister-tab-is-live-svelte-rewrite-done/13840) about the last milestone of the rewrite in Svelte of NNS dapp, I mentioned that we would share some more details about our plan regarding UX/UI.

In following lines I'll share some questions and propositions we have about the subject and, in addition to the screenshots, I'll also share a link to a test version of the NNS dapp that implements parts of our suggestion and goal.

***

## Navigation

As we might add more features to NNS dapp - such as SNS (discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-frontend-design/13847)) or "node providers" - we might have to add more pages (views) to the app. Therefore we might have to expend the navigation.

However, given the current design of the navigation - "Tab bar" - with do face a limitation.

Indeed, there is no more available space to add further links, particularly on mobile devices (see *Figure 1*). 

That is why we have the idea to replace the "Tabs" with a new "Menu" that can handle countless (or at least many more) navigation entries.

***

## Desktop support

Regardless if we like its design or not, one topic we might all agree on, is the fact that the dapp currently feels like it offers a mobile like experience on any devices - i.e. on desktop too. This is something we would like to improve in the future by proposing miscellaneous improvements to the UI design and user experience.

On one hand, the idea is notably to take better advantages of larger screen by spreading the content in one, two or three pseudo columns according available space. On the other hand, our UX designer (Mischa) also put lots of thought generally speaking on how information and any actions can be presented and executed in a more comprehensive way.

Such goal won't happen in a short term but we plan to develop and propose next features - e.g.  SNS - following these analysis and approach.

To compare current approach and this idea, you can have a look to Figure 2 and 3. Both mockup relates to the "Neurons" page. It should give I hope a more concrete picture of what I meant.

***

## Theming - "light skin"

Nowadays, it is quite common (in my opinion) for a web or mobile application to support theming. Generally two "dark" and "light" themes are implemented. We think that NNS dapp should offer the best experience and accessibility to anyone. As theming is part of such scope, we think we should also propose such customizability.

***

## Summary

- We propose to modify the navigation from a "Tab" based nav to a "Menu" based navigation
- The new UI/UX should also offer the best experience on desktop
- Theming should be introduced to customize design and accessibility according user choice

***

## Planning

- in next days: we are going to propose the changes related to the navigation (new menu, navbar and split-pane components)

- in a week or two: we would like to propose the addition of the "light skin" theme

- on a mid-term: we would like to implement SNS and other new features with the new UX/UI mindset that amend both mobile and desktop

- as longer-term goal: we would like to iteratively introduce such improvements to existing features too

***

## Sneak peek and test

A demo is probably better than my explanation (üòÖ), so would you like to test NNS dapp new "Navigation" and "light skin" that we aim to propose soonish?

Have a try to the test version we deployed on testnet ü§ó

üëâ https://7icuz-piaaa-aaaaa-aabca-cai.nnsdapp.dfinity.network/
 
Let us know what you think, looking forward to your feedback!

***

### Notes

- the test version uses a test deployment of II, therefore your anchor won't work. You can use my test anchor 10032 or if you rather like create a dummy one, go for it

- the test version lives on a testnet - no production data - if you modify anything it won't affect mainnet

***

### Screenshots, mockups, etc.

I like the changes to the NNS UI and UX and I am sure it will evolve. I was not able to login and view the new features but the pics gave me the idea.

I would like to ask a question in relation to the future changes and how it my evolve but I am not sure if my thinking is mislead or just dumb but I would like your opionion.

I did post this before but no one responded.

Should we not have our own internet engine that we login to the NNS where we are not using 3rd parties, that is built on the NNS for future searches on the NNS services?

This seems like a job for a community developer. I think kinic.io is building something similar to what you are talking about.

This is awesome, love seeing the UX/UI mockups for the new NNS dapp interface. 

My only feedback would be that the UI feels a bit generic and looks like a UI that comes with a bootstrapped project. Since this is the interface for a DAO that governs a billion dollar blockchain network, it would make sense for it to have at least a custom UI skin. Projects like Flower Power DAO and PapyrsApp have very unique UI designs that make them feel special and high-quality. In terms of UX, it seems like you guys have done a great job of designing the interactions. Nothing to change on that end. Thanks for the hard work!

For neurons I wish we would provide more information on neurons people are following. I don't like that we only have five groups right now. I know the foundation distributes voting across employees but even still we want to have a decentralization factor to how votes flow from the top neurons. If a few people are captured it is not good decentralization. I think a good UI would incentivize people to follow a wide variety of people. Specially if they can see the percentage of voting so they don't lose out on rewards.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2022-06-22 01:27:59 UTC | #6

I also think the UI looks very generic. I appreciate the work, but it looks like an early version of facebook. If we are going to rewrite this we need more versions before the community makes a decision. Otherwise we are just doing work that will cost more to remove and redo.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2022-06-22 01:46:13 UTC | #7

I also think nuerons are focused too much on staking/rewards and not enough on governance. We need to focus more on governance as it is the bed rock of the IC.

Fair point. I'll forward your feedback to the team, thanks!

Thanks for the feedback. Mischa, our UX specialist, has put lots of thought in the way NNS dapp handle and display neurons, so I guess the outcome suggestion will be way more handy than current implementation. Will forward your comments too.

My apologies, I did not understand your question.

Can you share the post your are mentioning? Can you try to rephrase, not sure what you mean with "our own internet engine that we login"?

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2022-06-22 08:08:57 UTC | #12

I will work on some designs and see if I can get some ideas across better. I think with all of this we just need more iteration before we do any development.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2022-06-22 08:15:41 UTC | #14

Can you share the figma link. I want to take a look at all the designs as I think about this problem more and create variants on those designs.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-06-22 10:32:15 UTC | #15

Our files contain lots of design and ux information, therefore we think it is not really a good support for such discussion as it would need quite some guidance at first to get into these. We will share often mockups that we can discuss, it will ease and focus the exchange of idea. Meanwhile of course, your inputs and drawings are most welcomed.

While I have your attention I would like to further expand on my reasoning for why our own search engine may be important.

When the web started we were able to view content then it upgraded to web2 that gaves us interaction and then security was bolted on with the problems we have today.

Just like the IC was redesigned with security first to overcome the problems of the past, we now have the chance to redesign a search engine that overcomes the problems as I see it today.

Searches that can be set to local, state, region or all. This can overcome regions that have security issues and their governments would feel it is in their best interest to clean up local problems and put users in control of their concerns and security.

But most of all the NNS community, which has brought up participation issues many times, would have a project that they can vote on and participate in building this new engine. At the moment I feel like a bystander and can only vote for the system teams which I can follow for rewards.

Give the NNS community a project that they can participate in and turn around this negative rhetoric that seems to only weaken the NNS and then their word of mouth would bring in new stakers

It's a test action that **never** makes it to mainnet. An action we use to generate test proposal for manual and e2e testing.

Aw shucks, I actually would like a better proposal creation UX. Maybe this gets put on the back burner until we solve the spam issue :rofl:

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-06-23 05:17:31 UTC | #21

Thanks for the answer and details. I think I get it a bit better now. To be honest with you, feels like it is not related to this thread as it has to do with user experience and design - i.e. no features per se.

Being said, if I get it right, you are advocating for a secure search engine on the IC. Did you had a look to the Kinic (https://74iy7-xqaaa-aaaaf-qagra-cai.raw.ic0.app/) project? Is that project solving or resolving partially maybe your idea?

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-06-23 23:29:22 UTC | #22

Will you have a message that the followed delegate neuron have been deselected.
I believe this happens every 6 months by the NNS?

[21h](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586/177?u=kvic)

Hello ICP community. Long time forum lurker.

Though I appreciate the communities‚Äô intentions of garnering additional stakers to join the NNS, I‚Äôm afraid such a proposal is merely a band-aid solution for a more fundamentally driven one. Let me explain.

Let us fancy this matter from an outsider view. Pretend you are a newcomer to the ICP space. You are intrigued by the disruptive technology being built on the ICP platform. You are a bit frightened by the price history of the token, but for some reason, an insatiable urge to learn the technology drives you to consume the red pill. You have a general understanding of other blockchains; however, you are convinced $ICP is quite literally the future. You quickly hit the market buy option on your favorite exchange and are now faced with the dilemma ‚Äì How can I earn rewards and participate in the DAO?

Let‚Äôs dive in. First one must create an ‚Äúinternet identity anchor‚Äù before having to log-in to the ‚ÄúNetwork Nervous System.‚Äù After said completion, you are left clicking the tabulated links on the top and eventually stumble on the word ‚Äúcannister.‚Äù Eventually, after clicking around and searching various web2 sites (Tisk tisk‚Ä¶), you deduce this is the appropriate option to stake your ICP. Upon staking you need to determine your dissolve delay, and are further bombarded with things like ‚ÄúIncrease Neuron Stake‚Äù, ‚ÄúSplit Neuron‚Äù, etc. Do you see the problem?

If we as a community intend to drive user adoption of the NNS for staking, we need to put ourselves into the shoes of our common crypto-peers. Needlessly verbose terminology is such a huge turn off for newcomers. What appears to be the intent of creating a cult-like mantra around the use of novel words and nifty idioms is exactly what turns people off from wanting to participate. Perhaps as important - participants must think to drive their decision-making process. Think of every other user-friendly stake platform. You login, find the stake button, and then bam ‚Äì rewards expressed as a percentage depending on your stake term.

We need an NNS that is so user intuitive, it‚Äôs a simple as logging into your favorite social media platform. Simply login, ‚ÄúStake‚Äù, and set your term. When you are ready, you can ‚ÄúUnstake‚Äù or ‚Äúrake your steak rewards.‚Äù (Folly, but an option. 8 Year gang baby!)

If you think this is ICP fud and crypto babble, I truly apologize. I‚Äôm totally engrossed with the technology Dfinity has built with ICP, and truly believe this has a chance to transform the internet as we know. However, we as a community must stop trying to create robust mathematical proofs to drive user adoption. Perhaps a greater emphasis on ease-of-use would solve that very problem instead.

There is only so much you can do with ui before it loses ux simplicity. UX simplicity should be the primary design goal. How would you eliminate the generic look, different button colors and background colors?

This is a test instance of the NNS dapp, tied together with a **test instance of Internet Identity** as well (note that the URL is _not_ https://identity.ic0.app). So your usual Idenitty Anchor will not work and you have to register a new one (just for this test environment).

FYI above test link is not active anymore as we had to redeploy our test canisters. Feedback were positive so we moved on and proposed today an updated version of NNS dapp that introduces the "light" and (revisited) "dark" themes üòÉ

Not sure whose resposability it is, but it would be nice if the service worker UI were improved a bit, for newcomers it gives a bad vibe combined to the weird URLs, since it's there to stay for a long time it'd be nice if it didn't look like something out of the early 2000s

You mean the service worker on the ic generally speaking right - i.e. nothing directly related to nns-dapp? If so yes, without knowing all the details, I think various tasks are on going or plan to improve the experience with the service worker. From a bit faraway, I keep an eye on the subject too üòâ.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-04 17:32:10 UTC | #29

It'd also be nice if in the voting tab the Filter's options were saved between sessions and there were a "clear/select all" button.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-07-04 18:11:04 UTC | #30

That's a good idea üëç. When we were discussing the UI recently, we began to discuss a bit such things as "user preferences." Our UX expert also have a couple of ideas. No concrete plan yet but next times the subject pops-up, will share your idea.

Note: we are really precautionary about data to keep between session, the selected "light or dark theme" info is the first ever and so far only info that is kept between session and we do so by first clearing ([code](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/e6965c3d3ff12470875ca06d9ea367ca123c3081/frontend/svelte/src/lib/services/auth.services.ts#L26)) the all storage to be sure everything is cleared on signout.

Hey Guys,

Three suggestions for the NNS dApp:

1. Currently when we add a hardware wallet as a hotkey we have the option of naming the hardware wallet. However, it is not possible to change that name without removing the hotkey and re-adding it. Could you please allow a feature that allows one to change the name?

2. It would also be helpful to create a nickname for neurons. Do you think this could be possible? 

3. Currently there is no way to add a whitelisted external address. Whenever I want to send funds from my account in the NNS dApp I have to copy and paste the external address and hold my breath. Being able to add a whitelisted address with the hardware wallet would be super useful. 

Thanks,
David

As far as I remember it is not possible - i.e. it's a limitation of the hardware wallet. I'll forward your msg to the team of course.

Thanks for the idea. It has been reported one or twice already, so I can confirm we are aware of the feature request. Being said, it is a more tricky question that it looks, both technically and UX wise.

Spontaneous idea, is it better to have a whitelist - that is used each time a transaction is made to check that the entered address is correct - or to have an address book of external addresses feature? e.g. being able to select an address in a list of external address I as a user have built (so no typing). What do you think?

I think having an address book is a fantastic idea. I would just caution that there should be some optional security measures in place which gets at the "whitelisting" idea. For example, one needs to use the hardware wallet to add, remove, or edit external addresses. I could see someone adding an external address and then a hacker gets access to internet identity, changes the external address, and so even if you use a hardware wallet to store funds you can accidentally send your funds to a hacker if the external address has been tampered with. Most exchanges ping you with an email if a wallet in your whitelisted address book has been added or has been edited or there's a 24 hour period during which you cannot transfer funds after a wallet has been added / edited. Its a nice security feature.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-08 05:46:22 UTC | #34

Gotcha. Thanks for the details. I have forwarded your three feature requests / suggestions to the team.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-08 06:14:51 UTC | #35

Kraken has the very best and smart security feature I have seen.

1- You can lock your account for all transfer and wallet activities with a delay (let say 30 days but you can set up less)
2- You setup an immediate unlock device (Yubikey)
3- lock your account.

If someone have access to your account, there is nothing they can do inside.  They can unlock operations but would have to wait 30 days to do anything.  You receive an email if they do unlock.

When you need to do an operation:

1- You use your immediate device to unlock operations
2- If you donÀãt have your device, or have lost it.  You can still unlock with a 30 days waiting period.
3- You receive an email or sms when unlocking operations.

I hope the NNS security will be improved with ingenious strategies.

NNS dapp team,

NNS dapp is looking fresh apart from one thing. I strongly feel the multi-colored banner at the top is very tacky and doesn't make me feel safe. Can you imagine JP Morgan displaying a multi-colored rainbow next to its bank account balance? No cos it feels unprofessional. Please reconsider that one thing.

As mentionned in one of my recent [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-dapp-ui-kit/16298?u=peterparker) we are working on a brand new design. If you check NNS-dapp and lib repo you might even found wip PRs.
