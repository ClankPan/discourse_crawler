**The Wall** is a crossover Ethereum/Internet Computer *demo* app. Use Metamask to login to Internet Computer. Then, write on the wall! 

**The Wall** is like Twitter on speed but the other way around - it's just short messages in a feed, most functionality you love is missing. âœ¨ **New in this version:** Every user gets their own wall! Click on any username or address to filter the wall. Check out users:
    - [Elon](https://wall.fmckl.se/0x00e5d9c7a813e525ae0fa12c712969e3cb6a31d7)
    - [Madmen](https://wall.fmckl.se/0xa22b5936f19459c8ecb1eb894282d4cf61e81273)

The app uses the public key cryptography of Metamask to generate a secure IC identity without having to rely on external login methods. Linking an eth account to an IC principal allows the use of IC as a layer 2 scaling solution and off chain application platform. 

The Wall is a guaranteed 100% server free experience.
