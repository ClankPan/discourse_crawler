Typically whenever a blockchain becomes really popular you see many forks of that blockchain. ICP technologically wise seems far more advanced than most chains. I haven't seen one fork of ICP (Which in general is a good thing since its no competition from a clone). However, I was still curious to why that was.

Does ICP patents protect individuals from forking the chain from a legal perspective?

Although only a few parts of ICP tech are patented, forking it would still require reinventing certain components to make it functional.
