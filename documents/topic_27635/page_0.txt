## Dfx 0.17.0 is promoted. You can read the release notes [here ](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/releases/tag/0.17.0).

This release includes the updated `dfx new` starter projects, along with some other new features. Be sure to note that `dfx canister call` will always fetch the `.did` file from the canister metadata. If the canister doesn't have the `candid:service` metadata, dfx will fallback to the current behavior of reading the `.did` file from the local build artifact.

For custom canisters, you can now add 
```json
"metadata": [
  { 
    "name": "candid:service"
  }
]
```
to the canister's definition in `dfx.json` in order to have `dfx` inject the canister's interface into the canister metadata for you after the build step.

Please let us know if you run into any problems!

> feat: create canister on same subnet as other canisters

>`dfx deploy`, `dfx canister create`, and `dfx ledger create-canister` now support the option `--next-to <canister principal>` to create canisters on the same subnet as other canisters.
The [registry canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai#get_subnet_for_canister) is used as the source of truth to figure out the subnet id.

This is interesting!  Does the replica perhaps now support subnet simulation? Or is this just for mainnet?  If it is supported then how would you set it up? I though it was an all or nothing on system vs. application subnet type.

The local replica does not support subnet simulation.  This is only for mainnet.
