Exciting news! I'm thrilled to announce the release of Chain Fusion: ICP + EVM Starter!

A seamless Rust-based starter template for integrating ICP canisters with EVM-based smart contracts, you can now easily get started with chain fusion within a few minutes. 

Some of the key features include:

1. Easy-to-use Rust canister for ICP-EVM integration
2. React frontend for interacting with Ethereum contracts via ICP
3. Support for both read and write operations on EVM smart contracts

Whether you're building cross-chain dApps or exploring the potential of ICP-EVM integration, this starter kit provides a solid starting point.

Try it out by running this command: 
``` 
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephen-Kimoi/icp-evm-rust-bridge/main/install_and_deploy.sh)"
```

I welcome feedback and contributions. Let's bridge the gap between ICP and EVM ecosystems together!
