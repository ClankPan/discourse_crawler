I am excited to announce that Google has lifted the compression ban on NFTStudio24. This issue arose when we shifted our content to a decentralized media platform using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

### What Happened?

As part of our commitment to innovation and staying at the forefront of technology, we decided to migrate our entire data infrastructure to a decentralized cloud. This shift ensures greater security, scalability, and resistance to censorship. However, this transition caused our website to be temporarily compressed by Google, affecting our visibility in search results.

### Our Team's Efforts

Our dedicated team at NFTStudio24 worked tirelessly to address this issue. We collaborated closely with the Google Japan team to resolve the compression problem. Through numerous discussions and technical adjustments, we successfully optimized our decentralized platform to meet Google's standards.

### Why Decentralized Media Platform?

Using ICP, our platform can offer unparalleled benefits:

* **Enhanced Security**: Data is distributed across a network, reducing the risk of single points of failure.
* **Scalability**: The platform can easily handle increased traffic and data loads.
* **Censorship Resistance**: Content is more resilient against censorship, ensuring free and open access.

### Positive Outcomes

We are delighted to report that our content is now fully indexed on Google. We expect to see our keyword rankings improve shortly, bringing us back to our previous levels of search visibility and beyond.

### Conclusion

This achievement is a significant milestone for NFTStudio24 and a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team. It also sets a precedent for other applications using ICP, showcasing the potential of decentralized technologies in the digital landscape.

Thank you for your continued support!

What does a compression ban refer to?

-------------------------

A compression ban for decentralized websites, like those indexed by Google, means restricting the use of data compression techniques to ensure data quality and integrity. For NFT Studio24, this ban initially affected our ability to optimize content performance and reduce bandwidth usage. Additionally, there was a concern because we connect and collect wallet information, which raised security issues.

However, we have now resolved these concerns. We submitted our security protocols, specifically following the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) standards, to Google. This help us to ensures that our website complies with their requirements and maintains high security and data integrity without relying on compression techniques.

Now Google has the ICP security protocol and whitepaper. Our initiative also helps other ICP projects as well. This is not just our success; it is ICPâ€™s success. It took more than five months to solve this issue.
