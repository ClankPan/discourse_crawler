# Motivation
Over the past couple of months, I've asked or raised the point several times asking for the IC-API to be open sourced. 
* https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-view-complete-non-named-neuron-voting-history/15721/6
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-is-the-internet-computer-association/15969/9

Others have also inquired asking for more visibility into this API
* https://forum.dfinity.org/t/where-are-the-informations-from-the-ic-api-coming-from/15405
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-rocks-the-ic-explorer/4262/28

The only response thus far that I've received is:
[quote="Dylan, post:13, topic:15721"]
The ic-api code is not open source. I’m not sure if/when it will be.
[/quote]

## What is the IC-API
The IC-API exposes many important IC stats such as subnet state size, # of canisters, transaction and cycle burn rate, account & transaction history, as well as neuron voting history. The IC-API powers the Internet Computer Dashboard, and several other prominent applications that pull various statistics from this API.

You can several of the API endpoints through their swagger dashboard here - https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api, and there is also a `v3/` (https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3) API for which I cannot find any swagger or other documentation.

## Why is it important that the IC API is open sourced?

We now have many promising signs that the IC is growing rapidly during this bear market, such as through the impressive cycles burn rate spikes shown via this Tweet from @chepreghy

https://twitter.com/Chepreghy/status/1597204084540334082?s=20&t=PLYX9fBpoM4GxIxZRqeqZQ

Much of the data incorporated into the IC Dashboard is all based on an off-chain CDN backed portion of the IC-API hosted on Cloudflare to handle large, aggregate data (too big for the IC?) and service in a performant fashion (too slow for the IC?), for which the code is closed source and owned by DFINITY (via the Internet Computer Association).

The foundation has also referenced the IC-Dashboard (which is powered by the IC-API) to give proof of their neuron holdings https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-voting-power/11801/2.

Until this code is open sourced and verifiable or another team builds their own API, we as a community cannot 100% trust the data coming from the IC-API, any marketing or promotion coming resulting from this data, or any products that directly incorporate this data (i.e. the IC Dashboard).

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-11-29 23:29:03 UTC | #2

This seems like a very reasonable request.

-------------------------

mystical | 2022-12-07 05:59:27 UTC | #3

Very good proposal, but what about the possibility of modifying the source code of the official dashboard vs the one that's open sourced, you can never know what runs behind the scenes on a website you browse, so basically if someone doesn't trust the official dashboard will have to host his own from this open source code in order to make sure it's the same?

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-12-15 06:59:44 UTC | #4

If the dashboard existed in a a canister people could compare the Wasm hash to verify that it was produced from the source code it was supposed to originate from.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-12-15 08:39:42 UTC | #5

Sure, but the the bigger issue isn’t the dashboard frontend. 

It’s the API and the pipeline feeding into the data store and cdn of which all of the dashboard data is coming from.

Without that being open sourced, the community has no idea about the data pipeline coming from the IC into the API data store, and it follows that we can’t know if the dashboard and IC stats data is completely accurate. We also don’t know if neurons or voting power are being hidden, etc.

Think about this - you’re building codebase for an ecosystem and network you think is expanding based on dashboard stats - but you have no idea if those are 100% accurate or not, and what the data and code backing those stats looks like. Exposing this in the API code would be the proof that the governance and network usage data is legitimate.

I also think that DFINITY would want to open source this so that external teams can build their own 3rd party explorer UIs to pull data from the IC-API or build their own network stats APIs, so I have no idea why DFINITY hasn’t given an official response to this post or the other times I’ve asked this question.

@diegop I know you’re busy, but can you possibly track this down for? (Give a reason as to why the IC API and is not open sourced?).

Update: I did escalate this within DFINITY R&D team.

* DFINITY agrees with open sourcing the dashboard code. The teams need to do more clean up and security reviews, so it is "on the path." Being realistic (and to set expectations), *I would say this would be measured in months not weeks* based on my experience in open sourcing key infrastructure pieces at DFINITY (clean up, docs, security reviews + follow up from security reviews).

For context: This falls under the purview of @jeff's team (who own the dashboard).

Here's the Swagger link for the ic-api v3:
https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/swagger

-------------------------

jeff | 2023-06-16 16:04:59 UTC | #11

We do publish a swagger interface and a redoc interface with all of the public APIs

https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/swagger
And
https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/redoc

-------------------------

0kenx | 2023-06-16 16:34:33 UTC | #12

That's very nice!

I guess the next step is to open source the IC-API itself, in particular:
1. Where do all the data come from. What data can be read by querying certain canisters? Any access restrictions involved in reading such data? What data can't be read publicly yet (e.g. requiring node access, or network topology knowledge)?
2. (less important) the data pipelines used to generate the API response.

If not everything can be practically open sourced at this point, I think it'd be nice to at least partially open source this, especially those related to neurons and voting.

-------------------------

delia | 2023-06-26 07:19:02 UTC | #13

Is there a way to get the complete list of ICP transactions from the Ledger Canister?

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transactions

-------------------------

jeff | 2023-06-26 16:24:47 UTC | #14

If you want to pull down all transactions, we recommend using the Rosetta API

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/rosetta/

delia | 2023-09-18 09:05:44 UTC | #16

Hi, when will "Node Provider Rewards" data (from https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation) be available as API? Thank you.

-------------------------

0x5279616e | 2023-09-18 17:07:01 UTC | #17

Hi [zlysunshine](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-source-the-ic-api-that-powers-the-internet-computer-dashboard/16910/15). Followees are not exposed in a public manner. Those can also be accessed by the controller or hotkey using `get_full_neuron` or `list_neurons` endpoints on the governance canister.

-------------------------

0x5279616e | 2023-09-18 17:33:52 UTC | #18

You can find the node provider rewards data from the following endpoint: https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/timeseries/reward-node-providers?end=1695057448&step=86400&start=1620604799

-------------------------

delia | 2023-09-19 07:11:33 UTC | #19

Thank you! Is it available as a single data (total) ? 
Like this for example: https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v1/transactions/icp-burned

-------------------------

0x5279616e | 2023-09-19 11:16:33 UTC | #20

This endpoint currently does not supply the total as a single data point, so I will add that as a bugfix ticket on our end. We should have that done and deployed within the next 2 weeks.

-------------------------

delia | 2023-09-19 11:40:27 UTC | #21

Thank you! Let me know please.

-------------------------

0x5279616e | 2023-09-20 16:53:18 UTC | #22

Hello. We have pushed out the change to return the total as a single data point: https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/timeseries/reward-node-providers.

-------------------------

delia | 2023-10-03 06:49:32 UTC | #23

Thank you. I would like to have also an endpoint for Disbursed Voting Rewards (ICP Minted from Maturity) always as a total value it it’s possible.

-------------------------

Fernando | 2023-10-10 15:54:19 UTC | #24

Why are there some endpoints where the API result seems to be limited at the beginning, even though the data shows up on the dashboard? 
For example, the timestamp to start in 12/01/2021
> `/governance-metrics/governance_dissolving_neurons_e8s?start=1638316800`

Returns values from 1692057600 (08/15/2023).

Any way I can get this older data?

-------------------------

Dylan | 2023-10-11 16:43:39 UTC | #25

Hi @Fernando, the ICP Dashboard has never used that particular endpoint. Try this instead:
https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/metrics/governance_dissolving_neurons_e8s_1year?start=1638316800

-------------------------

ZenVoich | 2024-02-13 07:02:49 UTC | #26

`/v3/canisters/` started to return `{"code":500,"status":"Internal Server Error"}`, more often for large offset

Are this APIs showing only the staked maturity into neurones? (The maturity re-staked)

/api/v3/metrics/governance_not_dissolving_neurons_staked_maturity_e8s_equivalent_1year
/api/v3/metrics/governance_dissolving_neurons_staked_maturity_e8s_equivalent_1year

While this shows only the stake (as we can see form the official dashboard)

api/v3/metrics/governance_dissolving_neurons_e8s_1year
api/v3/metrics/governance_not_dissolving_neurons_e8s_1year

I could not find any description ... but as I understood what we see here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons it is only the stake not the staked maturity.

That's right, the Neurons page does not have charts that show staked maturity, though it's something we're considering adding in the future.

Just to be sure, this shows only the "Staked" maturity, not the "Available" maturity. Right?

The NNS Governance canister doesn't export available maturity (i.e., maturity that is not staked) broken down by dissolve delay, but you can get the total available maturity using https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/governance-metrics/governance_total_maturity_e8s_equivalent. That value is just the available maturity and does not include staked maturity.

@diegop It’s been a year and a half since any update on Open Sourcing this API. I haven’t heard or seen this prioritized anywhere, but I see people touting cycle and growth metrics.

It’s feels like all this was brushed aside.

How can we trust any of this aggregate data if the collection methods and APIs aren’t’ open sourced? Is there a backdoor into the ICP to retrieve and scrape customer and application canister data that we don’t know about?

There really isn’t any way to know without more transparency here.

Totally reasonable. I am not aware of the dashboard teams work and priorities so I have pinged folks internally.

Hey folks,

I asked R&D leadership at DFINITY and the current thinking we are **currently working on providing more data about the IC operation that then anyone can use**. Resources are limited so that is higher priority in the stack.

This include data about the replica operation (so that anyone can verify whether or not nodes behave correctly) as well as data for canister developer (cycles consumptions etc) that will allow them to better develop their code.

So essentially, **we are prioritizing work on public metrics that are to the benefit of the IC**. 

I realize its not exactly what folks are asking, but it is the current thinking when the "reality of limited resources" meets "balancing protocol-level work."

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2024-04-30 05:24:12 UTC | #37

@diegop

I know you're doing your best to communicate word from R&D leadership, but their stonewall message communicated through your extraordinarily kind persona really feels like a slap in the face.

DFINITY has indeed been open sourcing the majority of its repositories over the past two years, but conveniently the IC API has been left out, regardless of the fact that this is the only repository that has a thread on the forum asking DFINITY to open source it.

Getting priorities from R&D leadership has nothing to do with open sourcing the IC API.

**I know that there is a small team within DFINITY that is specifically in charge of off-chain tooling, and data aggregation for the analytics that power the IC Dashboard**. This team is **NOT** working on AI, ckERC-20, or whatever the current roadmap items and priorities are.

I'm sorry again, but this is a deflection. You're talking about developer metrics, and I'm talking about network metrics, for which all of the bases of growth and usage of the Internet Computer Network are based off of, both in terms of marketing materials and read/used by investor analyses.

If it isn't a deflection, can you be more specific on the metrics and data that will be made visible?Hopefully through a pathway that is open source?

[quote="diegop, post:36, topic:16910"]

[/quote]

Again, this is **not** work that requires protocol engineers to work on it. Many of the engineers that work on the IC Dashboard and the IC API don't work at the protocol level. Unless there was a huge shake-up recently and that team was fired, that team has primarily been siloed to off-chain tooling & infrastructure for DFINITY. All of that is off of the IC (AWS), and there's nothing wrong with that...it's A LOT of data and would be unmanageable to all have on the IC.


There are a few thoughts that go through my mind seeing this lack of response over the past 18+ months, ranging from most likely all the way to conspiratorial.

1. DFINITY does not care about open sourcing off-chain components of their system.
2. DFINITY believes the IC-API and off-chain components of their infrastructure are insecure, and are therefore uncomfortable open sourcing them.
3. The off-chain metrics and aggregation is error prone, so it is possible that a bug will reveal false statistic in the IC Dashboard which could be embarrassing.
4. The off-chain components reveal a data export from the IC that DFINITY engineers can use to read private canister metrics and/or state for "debugging purposes" that would normally only be available to the controller of the canister.
5. DFINITY is purposely manipulating/specific data that is released through the IC-API to the dashboard. (i.e. hiding the neuron information of several high level team members so that their neuron activity and voting power is not searchable/viewable through the Dashboard)
