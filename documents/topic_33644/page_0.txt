Hey, I have an ongoing Bachelor's Thesis in TU Berlin and it aims to explore the important governance dynamics in SNS DAOs on the Internet Computer network. The research questions include analyzing liquid democracy principles, evaluating the effectiveness of governance structures and identifying trends and participation rates as well as the motivating factors of participating such as reward mechanisms. 
I already obtained the data for proposals of each SNS DAO from their governance canisters, where all the proposals are stored. These governance canisters have built-in methods for analysis of the system metrics.
Through using the dfx command prompts and the method “get_proposal” for individual and we first built a dataset of proposals for each distinct SNS DAO.

However, while collecting proposals by id one by one from OpenChat, an error has occured in some of the proposals. OpenChat has more than 1000 Proposals and approximately 100-125 of those Proposals were not collectable. I collected all of the remaining proposals and ordered it accordingly and took notes which Proposals (with their ids) were not collected. I looked for the proposals from their ids in the IC-Dashboard website and i made sure that these proposals exist.

Error I got while collecting these proposals was "No proposal for given ProposalID" with error code 10. But i am pretty sure that these proposals exist while i checked all of them individually. Some of the example IDs are : 675, 542,543, 312, 195,91 57, 26... 

Query call for one of the proposals with error is as follows: (according to the id of governance canister of OpenChat) in order:

NETWORK=ic
SNS_GOVERNANCE_CANISTER_ID=2jvtu-yqaaa-aaaaq-aaama-cai
ID=26 (or other not collectables) 

dfx canister     --network "${NETWORK}"     call --query "${SNS_GOVERNANCE_CANISTER_ID}"     --candid Desktop/SNS-Testing/candid/sns_governance.did     get_proposal "(record {proposal_id = opt record {id = (${ID}:nat64)}})"
And this is what it gives back: 
(
  record {
    result = opt variant {
      Error = record { error_message = "No proposal for given ProposalId."; error_type = 10 : int32 }
    };
  },
I would much appreciate it if somebody could help me on this one? Because that error i got makes no sense. I do not know if i am doing something wrong along the process but my supervisor tried to do the samething as well and got the same error. Why are these specific Proposals are not collectable and is there a way to fix it?

Thanks in advance!

This seems like a bug in the SNS governance canister. I'll raise it with Dfinity since they build and maintain the core SNS canisters.

I think this is the nominal behavior, not a bug. Specifically, at most 100 proposals with the same action are retained (the limit can be changed by proposal, but currently, OpenChat's value is 100).

Proposal 675 was a UpgradeSnsControlledCanister proposal, but there are 100 of those right now, which you can see like so:

```bash
$ cd src/ic

$ dfx canister \
    call \
    --network=ic \
    2jvtu-yqaaa-aaaaq-aaama-cai \
    --candid rs/sns/governance/canister/governance.did \
    list_proposals \
    '(record {
include_reward_status = vec {};
limit = 101;
// Only include 3 = UpgradeSnsControlledCanister.
exclude_type = vec { 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 ; 9 ; 10 ; 13 ; 1000 ; 1001 ; 2000 ; 2001 ; 2005 ; 3000 ; 4003 ; 5001 ; 5002 ; 5003 ; 7000 ; 7001 ; 1008 ; 8001 };
include_status = vec {};
})' \
    | idl2json \
    | jq '
[
  .proposals
  []
  | .action
]
| group_by(n)
[]
| {
  action: .[0],
  count: . | length,
}
'
{
  "action": "3",
  "count": 100
}
```

FYI 1: How to see the current limit:

```bash
$ dfx canister \
    call \
    --network=ic \
    2jvtu-yqaaa-aaaaq-aaama-cai \
    --candid rs/sns/governance/canister/governance.did \
    get_nervous_system_parameters \
    'null' \
| idl2json \
| jq '.max_proposals_to_keep_per_action'
[
  100
]
```

FYI 2: the retention policy is implemented [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/dfinity/ic/-/blob/rs/sns/governance/src/governance.rs?L4490).

FYI 3: Shout out to Arshavir for reminding me about the retention policy; I had forgotten about that.

Hi @ardaokutan, if you don't mind using an off-chain source of data, you can use the ICP Dashboard [SNS API](https://sns-api.internetcomputer.org/docs#/proposals) to get the data for those proposals. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about using it.
