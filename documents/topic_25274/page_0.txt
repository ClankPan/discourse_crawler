ICRC 7(Base NFT), 30(Approve workflow), and 3(Transaction Log) are reaching final draft status.  The following classes allow you to easily add the functionality from these standards to your motoko actor:

https://github.com/PanIndustrial-Org/icrc7.mo - Supports minting, burning, transferring of NFTs

https://github.com/PanIndustrial-Org/icrc30.mo - Supports the Approve, ApproveCollection, and TransferFrom workflow

https://github.com/PanIndustrial-Org/icrc3.mo - Supports a transaction log, including the creation of archive canisters that can store up to 96GB of transaction log data.

The following example puts them all together in a demo canister:

All are open sourced and MIT Licensed.  It would be helpful to have community eyes on them and to develop a community audit procedure so that the classes can be certified as safe for production use.

Pull requests and issues are welcome.

:wave: @PanIndustrial 

First off, thank you for these implementations, it's great to have them in Motoko.

> Pull requests and issues are welcome.

I just opened an [issue](https://github.com/PanIndustrial-Org/icrc_nft.mo/issues/3) on the icrc_nft.mo repository since I wasn't really sure which method was responsible of the behavior I saw. You'll see in attachement a scenario I made to reproduce the error. I would be curious to know your opinion on it. If you validate it's a real bug I could try to do a fix myself if you're busy.

Thank you
