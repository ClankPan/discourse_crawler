Hey,

I have some questions about own tokens on IC and how to integrate them with decentral and central exchanges.

* What is the best way to create own tokens that can be later exchanged on an exchange?
  * Create own canister that implement a specification like ERC-20?
  * Use service like https://dfinance.ai/ to create a token there where my own canister owns the initial supply?
  * User EXT Token Tool (https://k6exx-uqaaa-aaaah-qadba-cai.raw.ic0.app/) mentionend here https://forum.dfinity.org/t/deploy-your-tokens-for-free-using-our-ext-standard-and-new-online-interface/5816
* How to integrate such tokens in decentralized exchanges (on ic native or later when Ethereum integration is there on uniswap)?
* How to integrate such tokens on centralized exchanges like Binance?

Thanks
