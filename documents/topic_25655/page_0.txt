Hi there, I found the new updates for the p2p protocol for https outcalls, how does it work? Or how can we use it in our canisters?

Hi. I work on the networking team and implemented large parts of this new protocol that will eventually replace the old P2P implementation. It is part of the transition to use QUIC between IC nodes. The protocol will eventually be used for all communication between nodes on the IC but for now, to ensure everything works as intended, it will be enabled gradually. In the coming months, you will see more parts of the IC protocol using it. 

If you do an HTTPS outcall on any subnet with that runs the replica version `206a50f0` it will use the new protocol. It includes some improvements that reduce the number of network round trips necessary for consensus, so some latency improvement might be observable. 

If you are interested in how it works @yotam will follow up with a detailed forum post.
