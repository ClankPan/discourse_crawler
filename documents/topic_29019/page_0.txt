Hello everyone,

In order to better promote the development of the Mora protocol and the Mora platform, we are actively preparing to launch Mora Dao on SNS.

## What is Mora?

**Mora Protocol**: Enables the creation of peer-to-peer decentralized content platforms. For instance, it can be utilized to construct decentralized versions of Medium, YouTube, and Twitter.  

**Mora Platform**: This is a demonstration platform entirely built upon the Mora Protocol. It showcases the capabilities and benefits of fully relying on the Mora Protocol.  [Try Mora here. ](https://mora.app)

**Light Plugin System**: This is an open, no-programming-required software system developed entirely on the Internet Computer (IC). Light is designed as a peer-to-peer software system that can embed into any web page or content, allowing it to interact with IC smart contracts. [Try Light here. ](https://mora.app/planet/qvsfp-6aaaa-aaaan-qdbua-cai/0MPZESVYVK3P942JW5WEQ93T6Y)

#### Key features of the Mora Protocol include:

- A complete technical stack: The Mora Protocol's comprehensive technical stack allows us to create fully decentralized products while providing a user experience almost identical to traditional Web2.
- Decentralized content management: The Mora Protocol uses peer-to-peer transmission, granting users autonomy to manage their content across the entire internet. No longer constrained by centralized platform limitations, users can freely manage and share their content.
- User rights protection: Through peer-to-peer data transmission, the Mora Protocol ensures users unprecedented control over their data. User data privacy and rights are effectively safeguarded. Here, data represents not only content and text but also includes user relationships, financial data, and everything that belongs to the user.
- Through the openness and peer-to-peer characteristics of the Mora Protocol, we enhance network efficiency and stability. There is no longer a need to redundantly distribute the same content across different platforms; instead, platforms retrieve content from the protocol. This helps reduce the chaos and redundancy of content in traditional Web2, optimizing the overall order of the internet.
- Empowering users: The Mora Protocol redefines the relationship between platforms and users, placing users in control of their data and content. Users are no longer constrained by platforms.

Mora and light are innovative web3 projects. I support mora's sns sale.

-------------------------

pphaolu | 2024-03-28 12:40:34 UTC | #3

I have used Light, an imaginative and easy-to-use tool. I am looking forward to seeing more features. I wish the Mora team success.

-------------------------

EVAI | 2024-03-28 12:42:01 UTC | #4

Finally see the emergence of project with real innovative value! mora is the best product I have ever used in IC.I hope sns can help it develop better

-------------------------

ironhua | 2024-03-28 12:42:19 UTC | #5

在ic里面非常好的应用，发展潜力巨大，Mora to the moon!

-------------------------

Burning | 2024-03-28 12:43:14 UTC | #6

Yes! mora is one of my favorite projects and I often post articles on it hoping mora will be successful

-------------------------

slq016 | 2024-03-28 12:49:02 UTC | #7

You have been building for more than two years, and finally waited until you sns

-------------------------

xiachong | 2024-03-28 12:50:52 UTC | #8

mora I think it is a very good program and I hope the SNS will be successful. I will be involved in buying some as well.

-------------------------

ahdcoming | 2024-03-28 12:51:01 UTC | #9

Mora is a very good program, but with so little ICP raised, will it be bought out by a few people?  I feel that the max fundraising should be increased a bit, and it would be better to limit the max purchase amount per account.

-------------------------

WoW | 2024-03-28 12:53:30 UTC | #10

Peter and his team have been working on IC for over 2 years, their works like Dstar and Mora/Light are top-tier and well-utilized features of IC. Good luck to the SNS sale!

-------------------------

Limestonecowboy | 2024-03-28 12:55:24 UTC | #11

Love the platform! Will the SNS sale be available for US participation?

-------------------------

NeutronStarPRO | 2024-03-28 12:56:07 UTC | #12

I like Mora, good luck to the SNS sale!

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-03-28 12:56:56 UTC | #13

There are no country sales restrictions, thank you！

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-03-28 12:58:59 UTC | #14

Thank you for your question. We will consider everyone's feedback and make adjustments in the coming time.

Hi, I am wondering if the treasury of mora sns tokens will be staked and able to vote on proposals?

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-03-28 18:24:01 UTC | #17

We cannot use it for voting.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-03-28 18:25:50 UTC | #18

So the treasury tokens will not gain apy and or used to sway votes?

Is there a system in place preventing these tokens from ever being staked?

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-03-28 18:29:24 UTC | #19

These tokens will be collectively owned by all token holders, with their usage rights, including distribution and voting, determined by the collective will and voting results. The Foundation strictly regulates this process. We recommend referring to the detailed guidelines for further information.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-03-28 18:30:48 UTC | #20

I am a little new to understanding SNS sales. Could you point me to the page for the guidelines so I may review them?

-------------------------

Gekctek | 2024-03-28 19:03:44 UTC | #22

I do appreciate a project having something very useable before doing an SNS sale.

Are there any known portions of the project that would not live under the SNS yet? or is the project at a point where everything can be transferred to the DAO?

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-03-28 19:12:37 UTC | #23

Currently, the entire **Mora protocol** is built 100% on the IC network.
The **Light plugin system** is 100% based on IC.
While the **Mora platform** does utilize some third-party services at present, over 95% of the overall operations are developed and executed on the IC network. Below is a list of third-party dependency services:

* Planet Indexing Service (Due to the decentralized nature of all planets, centralized servers are temporarily used for indexing to ensure efficiency. Canister indexing will be implemented in the future. Anyone can participate in this indexing, currently demonstrated only on the Mora platform).
* IPFS Image Storage (To extend the lifecycle of planet cycles and reduce user costs, images and other resources are temporarily stored on IPFS. Canisters will be used for storage in the future).
* Copyright Verification Based on Arweave (Signing content for copyright verification, providing irreversible timestamps for content).

* URL to Card Services provided by iframely.
* The traditional login service provided by web3auth ensures that traditional methods can seamlessly access the Internet Computer.

How does this MORA sns affect current token holders? will it be a new token or is it just being inflated? to 100 million beccause I thought the max supply was 21 million as stated on ICPswap. thanks

-------------------------

cyanvell | 2024-03-29 08:29:18 UTC | #25

非常有想法的项目方，特点是实用、安全、创新。可以说是目前ICP链上与OpenChat、DSCVR同级别的社交应用，前途无量，值得长期关注。

$Mora inscriptions are unrelated to the Mora platform token.

-------------------------

molokanov50 | 2024-04-11 06:35:04 UTC | #27

Why mora token on icpswap is now named roma? Is it an original token or scam?

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-04-11 20:38:08 UTC | #28


The Mora Inscription is the name of the inscription movement initiated by other members of the community. It is not the official platform token issued by Mora. To avoid future naming conflicts, Kaos, the initiator of the Mora Inscription movement, initiated a renaming vote, which was ultimately determined to be Roma.

-------------------------

molokanov50 | 2024-04-12 06:43:27 UTC | #29

That means, Roma is a tempopary solution for the period of Mora DAO SNS creation? Will current Roma holders be presented a swap pool to transfer their Roma to original Mora platform tokens, without any loss?

-------------------------

jddllwqa | 2024-04-12 07:36:00 UTC | #30

The Roma inscriptions and the Mora platform token are not related in any way. The Roma inscriptions were merely coincidentally issued by the community member @kaos on the Mora platform, with the same name. Mora and Roma cannot be exchanged equally.
