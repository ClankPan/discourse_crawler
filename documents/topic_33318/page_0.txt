# dfx 0.21.0 is promoted! You can read the release notes [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/releases/tag/0.21.0).

Install `dfx 0.21.0` with `dfxvm`:

```
dfxvm install 0.21.0
dfxvm default 0.21.0
```
This release brings several fixes and enhancements including:

- The new command `dfx killall` kills all processes started by `dfx`.
- `dfx start` for the shared local network stores replica state files in unique directories for different replica versions or options. As a result, it is never required (but still possible) to use the flag `--clean`.

Please try it out and let us know if you encounter any issues!
