Hi! A little while back I published a project demoing how to use Verifiable Credentials on IC. It uses the Ethereum project [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co) as an example source of verifiable credentials.

Use this project as a starting point to create issuers, the code is MIT licensed and found here: 
https://github.com/kristoferlund/passport-score-issuer

## Companion article

I also just published a companion article that provide a high level overview of the project and the VC flow.

## About Gitcoin Passport
> *Passport helps you collect “stamps” that prove your humanity and reputation.* 

The more stamps you collect, the higher your reputation. Passport scores are accessible through an API provided by Gitcoin can also be minted as "attestations" on Ethereum. Up until now, the passport score is a credential that has not been available on IC.

Happy reading! Would be super cool to see some more VC issuers pop up on IC!
