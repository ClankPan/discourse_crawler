As many of you know, I have taken a much more adversarial position towards the NNS post [taggr](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/fixing-taggr-communitys-broken-update-issue-announcing-imminent-nns-proposal/19112/256) incident. 

Consequently, we (Departure Labs) have moved away from the IC being our primary target. But, we do still believe the tech, team, and mission are strong. Today, the IC is still the best positioned platform to host robust, accessible, decentralized protocols. The IC cannot rely on this being the case forever.

I personally don't have a proposal for a better NNS design. Even if I did—I'm unsure the NNS would be willing to relinquish the level of control it presently has. Yes, stakeholders (the NNS) in the IC have the absolute right to control what content exists on the IC in the same way stakeholders in Ethereum do. As I've previously stated, the NNS is unique in that it can mutate itself much quicker than ETH could ever dream of. This property of the IC provides unique benefits. But, it also provides unique risks to projects targeting the IC. 

With the tooling available to projects today I feel the NNS is an existential risk to all projects building on the IC. 

I believe this risk could easily be mitigated by giving projects adequate tooling to leave the NNS hosted IC. If providing this choice makes you uncomfortable I encourage you to reflect on why before engaging in this discussion. 

In a way I'm asking the NNS to define the relationship with projects and developers. I think most would be more than happy to pay rent to utilize the benefits the NNS IC provides. But, I don't think this entitles the NNS IC ownership of the data in those hosted canisters. 

Give projects the ability to leave. I firmly believe this will result in a net gain of trust in the IC. 

I'm interested in proposing this via the NNS but I don't presently have the bandwidth to make that happen. I'm more than happy to give what I can to make this happen in a much more limited capacity. 

Finally, I ask all of you who took the time to read this to completion to take some time and consider what a YES or NO vote conclusion would signal via the NNS.

this doesn't include heap, isn't verifiable post export, requires explicit usage of stable, and requires every developer to roll their own export system ;). 

`dfx export <principal_id> --heap, stable`

What specific part of leaving are they not able to do?

If you are looking for a tool to download the canister-data, check this library out: https://docs.rs/canister-tools/latest/canister_tools/. You can download the canister heap data and stable-memory. 

For verifiability you can call the download methods with replicated query mode so you get certification on the responses and even save the certificate of each call if you want.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-08-14 19:04:43 UTC | #6

Appreciate you sharing this. However, I think a more straight forward solution would still be allowing the heap and stable state to be directly exported from the IC. As far I can tell the `canister_tools` crate still relies on serialization strategies to export data. 

Maybe it would be helpful to summarize my ask a bit more concisely:

> As a canister controller I should be able to download a copy of my canister data in its entirety and run it elsewhere.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-08-14 19:13:32 UTC | #7

Also, imagine the case where I have N-GiB of personal photos stored to the IC. 

Using canister defined export mechanisms I would incur substantial cycles cost far outside of what is actually required. 

Instead of just giving me the blessed data stored for the canister, now we have to have the IC invoke the canister, copy the data from stable into heap, pass that data back though the wasm boundary to the host over the network back to the user.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-08-15 07:07:44 UTC | #8

You know what, you're right.

We need a swift exit mechanism just in case some guys in the US want to fork the Internet Computer and we need a quick way to migrate all the dapps.   

Or you could use ic-stable-structures and open source an API to download the memory in chunks smaller than the egress limit.

What's the narrative here, person who hasn't posted in 4 months??

Hazel | 2023-08-14 19:57:04 UTC | #9

@borovan - I dream to clone the entire IC into IC-MEGA-XL_stable_diffusion.exe :smiling_face_with_tear: 

Just kidding.. or am I? 

No, seriously though. I think this is functionality that has been placed on the back-burner for some time and is slowly ramping up to becoming a serious threat to all projects on the IC. 

- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/efficient-ways-to-clone-a-canister-s-data/12066/2
- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/backup-restore-function-for-a-canister/12849/8
- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-developer-tooling/11941/34

I am no longer actively developing on the IC so I'm approaching this from the perspective of someone who wants to continue using the IC. Also, as a developer, the **NNS IC** is the best positioned platform for building robust decentralized protocols, I want to continue to aid in its growth but I can't in good faith until I feel confident we're not going to get screwed.. Trust, but verify. I'm verifying right now. 

To be clear I'm advocating data exports by canister controllers. SNS projects will not be able to just exit unless they vote to do so. I think having the ability to exit will make the SNS an even more powerful tool outside of the IC by assuring the NNS remains aligned with the needs of the projects it's protecting. Competition is good.

Moreover, even if someone did manage to clone the IC they're be lacking all of the institutional knowledge the foundation has collected. It wouldn't work. Now, whether or not this is a good thing is outside the scope of this discussion lol...

Also low-key can't believe you forgot me already person who has remained active :sob:

borovan | 2023-08-14 20:06:44 UTC | #10

Oh I'm aware of what you're doing, but there's a subtle anti-foundation narrative being peddled by some people so forgive me if I lump you in the same basket as them.

What you're saying seems like an overly-contrived scenario, and I've seem similar posts recently.  The default position, in my opinion is that we have 270 amazing people contributing to never-seen-before technology and we should be standing on their shoulders.

Are you giving up on web3?  If you don't mind me asking what platform are you going to focus on now?

I tend to assume that anybody who'd jump ship as early as this has been influenced by somebody with an agenda.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-08-14 21:24:42 UTC | #11

My stance on the Foundation hasn't changed since mainnet launch. Please do not misunderstand my public criticisms—If I believed the foundation had nefarious intent I would say it directly.

I was very public about my feelings that the foundation was doing too much in the app layer and needs to focus on making the IC protocol as robust as possible. I've spoken in public and directly to the team about my concerns regarding developer experience, apparent limitations v.s marketing, etc. 

To me its clear the foundation is committed to making the IC the best it can be even if I don't agree with a lot of their decisions :woman_shrugging:. 

> What you’re saying seems like an overly-contrived scenario, and I’ve seem similar posts recently. The default position, in my opinion is that we have 270 amazing people contributing to never-seen-before technology and we should be standing on their shoulders.

I want to argue my stance as a developer. But, I have to ask that you sympathize with this ask as a user. Users / Projects deserve to own their data. Providing this mechanism creates a clear reference to judge all future data ownership models from. Furthermore, this is something you get for free from other blockchains. The "Private" data model of the IC is powerful and should be a huge asset. But, without this I feel its a liability. 

> Are you giving up on web3? If you don’t mind me asking what platform are you going to focus on now? 


No, I'm not giving up on web3. But, am fully committing to another more balanced approach of how we use it—Web3 should be reserved for the parts of the protocol that explicitly deal with trust.

So, we're building an open source product stack. I want to take all of my experiences building product in Web2 and all of the experiences I just had with the IC, to make it as simple as possible for small teams to build great product. I think the biggest problem we're having with decentralizing the web is its too damn hard to build great product.

Part of this stack enables building decentralized "cloud" apps. But, getting these apps to do anything useful will require building **trusted** protocols—something the IC can provide. And, something it provides better than anyone else. 

I want to build a complimentary product to the IC. I don't think it's possible to express how completely disinterested I am in building anything that needs to manage trust like the IC does. We're building everything that the IC isn't. 

edit* For what we're building to be useful, I think we're ultimately going to need to direct teams back towards some web3 stack to build very significant parts of their applications. In my mind the obvious choice should be the IC. I need to be fully confident on that decision so I'm back to cause trouble :). 

> I tend to assume that anybody who’d jump ship as early as this has been influenced by somebody with an agenda.

Naw, I smashed my face into this thing for over a year. I legit just think we're using this thing the wrong way right now. It's novel and new. Remember the "ditch your database" slogan? Pretty sure we're just trying to put the shape into the wrong slot.

Can you give examples of this overreach into the app layer?

Of course they should be involved, look at the mess with token standards and the recent ICRC innovations.  I've heard this line repeated a lot, but usually without any concrete reason why the team who built the IC should be restricted only to the "protocol layer".

I don't understand why it is important to exit the IC. 

Each user should be able to download their data to their machine and we can call that a win. Transferring all the data from each app to another chain is not necessary right now. Honestly, the foundation is doing all it can to get it to grow. I think that is the best allocation of its resources. I don't think there has been one app that has reached global popularity. 

[quote="Hazel, post:9, topic:22132"]

I mean this is why it is impossible. 

The best way to exit is to sell out of ICP. I think the multichain world outside $$ is providing a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. 

I think each user should be able to copy their data and I think that should be possible. Prob good to have in case anything is whipped out. However cloning the whole chain is impossible and unnecessary.

Honestly, I thought this would be a widely popular suggestion and a huge home run in terms of "shows of good faith" for the NNS. Is it possible that the forums just aren't where these discussions are happening anymore?

Still...

I didn't expect to get hit with passive accusations challenging the nature of my intentions. Moreover, I certainly didn't expect to be met with resistance on a proposal that essentially asks to build a mechanism allowing me to access my own damn data in a canister.

If the intention was to drain the small amount of bandwidth I had left to commit to trying to have a positive impact here, then I'm going to pick my battles and give you that.

Anyways, I hope someone can continue the carry the torch here.

"cya" ;)

Hey Hazel,

Good to see you here!

Providing platform support for snapshotting and exporting is something that was discussed during the last  [ICP.Lab on Storage and Scalability](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icp-lab-storage-scalability-summaries/20242), and is something that DFINITY wants as well.

[quote="domwoe, post:1, topic:20242"]
The minimum required on the protocol level is the ability to take snapshots of a canister when it is stopped, and forking from an existing snapshot. Besides that, it would be great to allow downloading and uploading the snapshots.
[/quote]

Maybe @dsarlis or @ulan can give an update on the state of these features.

Just FYI: 
There's also the recently released [`dfx deps`](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/features/dfx-deps) feature, which makes it easier to provide and download wasm modules related to canisters, and there are ecosystem projects like [LightIC](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-mock-replica-lightic/18782) which provide alternative implementations to run canisters outside the IC.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-08-16 07:56:33 UTC | #21

You can access the data, just create a method for it and stay under the 2mb egress limit.  I don't see why this is such a big deal

I haven’t jumped into this conversation yet, as I feel as though you’ve handled it extremely well, and my involvement will only take away from your objective (given this conspiracy that I am a paid bad actor trying to take over the NNS). 

With that being said, I personally resonate with the sentiment & proposal you’ve presented. I’m rather surprised that more people have not asserted that they to recognize the value in a truly decentralized blockchain - in which does not “own” user assets, but rather “manages” the assets for them. 

Unfortunately, your concluding statement holds true - the forum is no longer a place for diverse conversation & opinion. A few months ago it was “hijacked” for lack of better words, by users who are insistent on belittling & deteriorating anything with the potential to spark decentralization, or “potentially reduce DFINITYs voting power” (I don’t even think this proposal does that, which is why I find the characters tone within this thread so amusing). 

Ironically (given it was once begged that we stop using twitter - as it is bad PR for DFINITY - and switch to forums instead), your best bet is making your voice heard on twitter (or other social platforms) in alignment with the proposal. 

That is the only way to truly reach the ecosystem anymore.

Nobody is saying to hand anything over.

This imaginary figment that you & @dominicwilliams have - that everyone who wants to contribute to this decentralized, open source protocol; wants to take it over - is going to lead to its downfall. 

I understand you don’t trust ICP with anyone else yet - hell, I don’t even trust ICP with you yet.

Hence why you so frequently see me say “don’t trust, verify”. 

Nobody is saying DFINITY should relinquish all VP, and simply go away. Nobody is saying DFINITY should be “pushing” alternative contributors. 

But if DFINITY (Dominic) is so concerned with the “threat” of (another) business being taken over, maybe you should invest resources in building the ecosystem with you, rather than against you. 

If you want to maintain this claim that it’s a decentralized protocol; 99.99999% of github commits and code based executions can not be coming from DFINITY. Node Providers can’t be gatekept by DFINITY (Yes, I know there are already great strides to alleviate this concern). There are steps to be taken to further the credibility of the protocol. 

Centralization is not a solution. 

It’s what the Internet Computer sets out to solve.

aiv | 2023-08-15 21:00:52 UTC | #42

@borovan 

I'm not sure where you're getting your Code & State opinions from, but I thought I'd help clear up a few things:

**1. Cédric is awesome!**
Seb and I were both very active for over a year in the ICP ecosystem before we met Cédric in November 2022. We quickly realized he's an awesome guy and got excited to work with him!

Check out his [website](https://cedric.vc/) or his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/cedricwaldburger). He's a tech founder with successful edits and has been a VC for like 15 years even though he's only 35. He started his first company at age 14!

He's very open and is exactly who he portrays himself as. These are just some of the reasons Dom brought him in early, as a founding board member of DFINITY. If you speak to any OG staff member at DFINITY, you'll find that they only have positive things to say about Cédric. Best boss I've ever had!

**2. Code & State has no anti-DFINITY agenda whatsoever!**
Cédric left DFINITY because it was growing into a large organization, and he prefers working within small nimble teams because that's where his strength is as an entrepreneur. He likes early stage ventures. At Code & State we don't intend on ever growing beyond 15 full time staff, so it's clear that we have no desire or inclination to ever do what DFINITY does.

We support DFINITY's work, we have NEVER said a word against DFINITY, and we even asked Dom's permission before doing the conference just to make sure we weren't disrupting any of their plans. We also don't do anything that DFINITY is already doing, we are just helping to create building blocks for the ecosystem which are outside the scope of what DFINITY does. These are things like creating the 1st ICP talent agency, 1st ICP code auditing firm, taking over and running Motoko Bootcamp, etc. We aim to reinforce what DFINITY has built and catalyze the emerging industry being built on ICP.

**3. Code & State has not had any involvement with the NNS or protocol governance**
At some point there might be a Code & State known neuron, but that's probably a long way off and it is just not a priority for us right now. We've made no public announcements or opinions regarding NNS proposals or anything like that, and Cédric isn't even a known neuron or voice that's active on any NNS governance matters. In short, we're happy to just keep our focus on building ventures that help ICP entrepreneurs.

Where there might be some confusion here is with my personal NNS governance participation. Before I even met Cédric I created the NNS Proposal Submission dapp (as part of a DFINITY bounty), and then became a Known Neuron and headed up the Ethos Proposal that got shot down. All of that was before I started working for Code & State, and to be honest I haven't been super active in NNS governance since I got this job. When I am vocal on governance topics, I'm strictly representing my own personal opinions, not those of Code & State. I'm NOT a founder of Code & State, just a full time employee, and I was a voice within the ICP ecosystem for well over a year before I started work at Code & State on January 1st 2023. Basically, if I say something from my personal Twitter or from my personal account on this forum (such as this post) it's coming from me as a long time ICP community member, it's not an official Code & State communication.

-------------------------

aiv | 2023-08-15 21:16:33 UTC | #43

Oh yeah, and @Accumulating.icp just know each other from back when I proposed the Ethos Proposal. Like he said, he's not got any relationship with Code & State.

I'm honestly not sure why Code & State was even brought up in this thread.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-08-15 23:40:38 UTC | #47

To be honest I'm not sure either, this thread was about technology, so Code & State is possibly the last thing I'd expect to see mentioned.

The feature to provide snapshots and the ability to export/download those snapshots is in the early stages of discussion and exploring the scope. The relevant people are working on other items at the moment but it's in the bucket of next features to pick up more actively. I don't have a precise estimate to give now besides that we're most likely looking at a couple of months at least before we have some results.

Hey,
I just wanted to share my thoughts here. This is my personal opinion and not an official C&S communication. Just like my regular posts here or tweets.

Firstly, I'm super proud to be a part of Code & State. I was actually the 1st full time employee there, so I've been involved from the early days. Working there has been amazing, and I agree with @aiv points. Cedric is a great boss, and my professional/personal growth has been amazing since joining, almost 1 year ago. 

At Code & State, we've organized great free bootcamps (with [another one starting next week](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-the-typescript-bootcamp-one-week-to-build-a-dao/21878) btw - no time for vacations!). We've trained hundreds of devs, created the resources to do so, showcased ICP tech countless times, and even helped some professionals get hired into top ICP startups. Once again, I’m proud of the work we’ve been doing and that’s only gonna get better. 
From an ICP ecosystem member perspective, having an organization like Code & State dedicated to the ecosystem is incredibly valuable. Actually, I believe that we should have more organisations like C&S (competition is good!). We need more people working in this ecosystem. We need more capital in this ecosystem. 

I found the accusations in this thread sad to read. It's not just about Code & State; there are accusations thrown at DFINITY and community members too. Throwing false accusations or attacking people is never helping.  Shutting down questions is never helping. Anyone should be able to freely ask questions and share his concerns about the NNS or centralisation of power. I remember a few months after Genesis where we could have a respectful and open discussion on this forum, I wish we could go back there. 

Two years ago, I decided to drop out of school and bet it all on ICP. Why? Because, I’m incredibly admirative of the technology DFINITY has built, believe in Dom's vision and think the Internet Computer will change the world. I’ve met many DFINITY team members in person and even visited the DFINITY HQ in Zurich (that’s actually where I met Cedric and got pumped at the idea to work at Code & State). Meeting them has only reinforced my beliefs in ICP. I shared my admiration for what they’ve built and the work they’ve been doing directly with them. I’ve received countless support from DFINITY for the initiatives I’ve worked on. And I will keep working with DFINITY as much as possible. Never, while working at Code & State I’ve been forced or suggested to work against  DFINITY. That would have been against my values and convictions. What DFINITY has built is incredible and I’m dedicated to putting my next years of energy to bring more builders, building an amazing educational powerhouse for this ecosystem and helping decentralize this ecosystem doing so. 

To anyone reading this if you have concerns or want to have an open discussion, never hesitate to speak up. Your voice matters. Asking questions, being curious or skeptic is normal. Don't let the fear of being accused stop you from speaking up. We need open talks, transparency and accountability.

I don't know about replacing but ICP needs other major contributors. Also ICP doesn't belong to Dfinity. Anyone should be able to come in and participate in the protocols.

I'm a libertarian, I don't flag posts any posts of any kind because I think everyone should have the write to post whatever they want and readers should not have the ability to censor things that "offend" them. People shouldn't be able to censor on a Web3 forum.

I hope they someday host they forum on a decentralized platform that doesn't have these censorship functions.

Anyways, you probably won't believe me, but those who know me will know that I'm not the one who's been flagging your posts.

What?

The ICP Devs neuron has nothing to do with Code & State.

It's controlled via an Axon DAO, and I'm pretty sure the ICDevs board contains DFINITY staff members as well. I'm on the ICDevs board for some dev contributions I had made, but @skilesare will probably tell you that unfortunately I haven't contributed too much. In all honesty, we all owe @skilesare gratitude for all the work he does on his own time to keep this neuron and ICDevs.org running, the bounties are a great help to the ecosystem!

On a different note: Does anyone know how to File a class action against DFINITY for Insider trading? Looking for directions here.

This is not helpful!

Artia told me that they never sold a single ICP throughout all price drop, they have the best interest of the ecosystem at heart!

To be honest I’m not sure either, this thread was about technology, so Code & State is possibly the last thing I’d expect to see mentioned.

Yes, we are a Venture Studio, not a protocol contributor.

We support entrepreneurs, and our only technical staff member is Seb, who spends his time creating resources to train new devs!

I don't know how many other ways there are to say this, we have no interest in contributing to the protocol. DFINITY has already been doing an incredible job with that, ICP has launched more incredible features this year (such as the BTC integration) than any other L1 foundation! When it comes you pumping out protocol innovation, DFINITY is the GOAT!

As ICP projects slowly grow in size and revenue, I think they will naturally begin to invest in building up their dependencies. This is how open source software survives in Web2, there are devs who get a salary to build on Open Sourced software because their company is simply protecting the foundation of it's revenue stream.

In other words, as soon as more ICP projects start making serious money the more the decentralization of protocol contributions will inherently increase.

Well the whole situation was just the result of multiple black swan events all happening at once.

I think the two biggest factors were the FTX manipulation and just the overall timing. The big 20% web3 price drop which signaled the bear market happened like the day after. Between that and all the futures manipulation and false FUD, I don't think there's anything any foundation could have done to prevent negative price action.

I lost a lot of money myself, but I'm still here and bullish, ICP will win in the end!

Moderator Note:

Yet again, I find myself having to remove comments, warn users, and close a thread.

As far as I can tell:

1. The actual relevant posts to answer @Hazel 's questions were addressed here (and those looking for relevant information):

[quote="domwoe, post:20, topic:22132, full:true"]
Hey Hazel,

Good to see you here!

Providing platform support for snapshotting and exporting is something that was discussed during the last [ICP.Lab on Storage and Scalability ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icp-lab-storage-scalability-summaries/20242), and is something that DFINITY wants as well.

[quote="domwoe, post:1, topic:20242"]
The minimum required on the protocol level is the ability to take snapshots of a canister when it is stopped, and forking from an existing snapshot. Besides that, it would be great to allow downloading and uploading the snapshots.
[/quote]

Maybe @dsarlis or @ulan can give an update on the state of these features.

Just FYI:
There’s also the recently released [`dfx deps`](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/features/dfx-deps) feature, which makes it easier to provide and download wasm modules related to canisters, and there are ecosystem projects like [LightIC ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-mock-replica-lightic/18782) which provide alternative implementations to run canisters outside the IC.
[/quote]

[quote="dsarlis, post:50, topic:22132"]
The feature to provide snapshots and the ability to export/download those snapshots is in the early stages of discussion and exploring the scope. The relevant people are working on other items at the moment but it’s in the bucket of next features to pick up more actively. I don’t have a precise estimate to give now besides that we’re most likely looking at a couple of months at least before we have some results.

2. Everything else was just distraction, off topic, ad ad hominem messages removed.
