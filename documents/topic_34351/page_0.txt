I have a svelte project with the following structure:

```
src/backend
    frontend
    declarations
```
When I use the canister ID i imported with:
```
import { idlFactory, canisterId } from "../../../declarations/backend";
```
 
I get:
`Error: Canister ID is required, but received undefined instead. If you are using automatically generated declarations, this may be because your application is not setting the canister ID in process.env correctly.`

Even though my ".env" file is populated:
```
CANISTER_ID_BACKEND='by6od-j4aaa-aaaaa-qaadq-cai'
...
```

It should be working! Try placing a line with
```ts
console.log(process.env.CANISTER_ID_BACKEND);
```
and see if it's also `undefined`. You may need to double check your vite or webpack (or whatever bundler) config to make sure it's loading the `.env` file correctly
