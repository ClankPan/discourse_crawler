Hi there, I noticed that your roadmap mentions the Helium milestone:

> Chain Fusion Supports Solana
This milestone enables Chain Fusion for the Solana network, bringing Solana and ICP closer together, combining the powers of the two networks. Dapps leveraging the capabilities of both networks look and feel like single-network dapps.
**Threshold EdDSA signing**
Threshold EdDSA support using cryptographic multiparty computation (MPC). Enables trustless integrations with all chains using EdDSA on the Ed25519 curve like Solana or Cardano.
**Solana RPC canister**
RPC canister connecting to Solana RPC providers to integrate with the Solana network. Enables two-way communication with the Solana network.

I would like to know the current progress of this milestone and when these two functionalities can be used on IC canister?"

We are a few months (not weeks or years) away from this. The signature work is well underway.

@boern Do you have any concrete plans or use cases?

You can start interacting with Solana today:

* You can interact with Solana RPCs using HTTPS outcalls. The [Galactic Bridge](https://github.com/weichain/galactic-bridge-icp/tree/main/src/minter/src) is doing this (see e.g. the code inside `sol_rpc_client`.

- You can sign payloads to Solana Programs with tECDSA and verify them inside Solana Programs (Galactic Bridge uses that mechanism as well)

- You can use https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister to sign Solana transactions. However, please use this only on Solana testnet or very small amounts, as the private key is essentially created and stored in the canister and doesn't leverage threshold cryptography.

@domwoe, thanks for your response. I am from Omnity dev, and we are planning to implement cross-chain between IC (Internet Computer) and Solana on Omnity.
