I am looking at EXT NFT standard, but still not sure how to attach picture for a NFT. 
Any idea?

You could store the picture(s) in a separate storage canister and add the "access" information of the storage as metadata

Thanks! There should be some standard metadata, right? Otherwise wallet won't show the picture.

Looking for the same https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/extendable-token/blob/main/examples/erc721.mo

What is the metadata field?

dfx canister call erc721 mintNFT "(record { to = (variant { \"principal\" = principal \"myprinc\" }); \"metadata\" = blob \"somedata\" } )"        

This does not work and I am wondering why it is type Blob?

How do you do that?

Isn't it better that the image is added in the same token?

You can this code.https://github.com/xiaoyuanxun/NFT-Standard/blob/main/NFT.mo
It may be a wonderful choice.
It combines https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-nft and https://github.com/Di-Box/Bucket
The most unique place is that you can store your tokenmetadata in the canister at a fast speed

and you just need let the location be the #assetcanister : (Principal, Blob)

very helpful, thanks!

I guess, metadata can be any type of data(prime, json, file, image...)
