It's nice to see a buzzing forum off late. I wanted to raise a question that I feel some of the team members would be best suited to answer.

Question being:

Does Dfinity feel they can compete or get a meaningful market share from the current web2 cloud giants? Those guys have thousands of dedicated sales/marketing and onboarding teams that help companies onboard and in some cases provide them with sizeable upfront credits for computing.

Does Dfinity have any dedicated team for this that can onboard new users?
