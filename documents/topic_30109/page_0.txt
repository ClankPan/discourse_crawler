Hi, officer
I have two question about nodes?
1.What is the node selection mechanism of subnet? Specifically, how does a 13-node subnet select 13 independent node providers from more than 13 Node providers and use their node machines as the nodes of the subnet? Random selection, geographical proximity selection or whateverï¼Ÿ
2.Node suppliers are public, theoretically they can communicate directly with each other. Due to the limited number of subnet nodes, the communication cost is not high. How does ICP prevent nodes from concatenation for evil? Is there any punishment mechanism for nodes to do evil or reward mechanism for detecting evil behaviors?

Waiting to your reply.
