Could somebody provide exact instructions on how to add a new device to your Internet Identity in 2024?

The instructions that can be found online seem to be outdated and i can not find a way to add a new device to the II (NNS Wallet).

When i go to nns.ic0.app after entering the II number i get forwarded to identity.ic0.app (the inside of the NNS wallet).

When i click the user button on the top right of the wallet & click manage internet identity, i get bumped out and have to sign in with my II number again and get forwarded to identity.internetcomputer.org to manage the devices where one can add, rename or remove devices.

When clicking add new device or what ever the button says, i get a QR-Code & (a link below) to scan or type in on a new device i wish to add to the II. 
The problem is, this is linked to the managing page identity.internetcomputer.org and not to the NNS Wallet page: nns.ic0.app or identity.ic0.app where the actual wallet is. 
This creates a passkey on the new device linked to identity.internetcomputer.org and when trying to log in to the NNS wallet on nns.ic0.app (being forwarded to identity.ic0.app - The inside of the NNS wallet)-
there is no passkey available on the new device for that adress identity.ic0.ap. Only for the managing page identity.internetcomputer.org. and there is no passkey available to log in to the NNS wallet.

So that did not work.


Also tried another way: to go to nns.ic0.app, click sign in with internet identity - then being forwarded to identity.ic0.app, click more options (if the II number is already pasted), then click "continue with another device" i followed the instructions given, but they seem outdated and lead to nowhere, prompting to click "add a new device". This button is nowhere to be found, and i cant find a way to add a new device to a existing II. **Please try it yourself**

In addition, i asked AI on internetcomputer.org & searched google how to add a new device to internet identity. The instructions provided seem outdated and the Add a new Passkey button is not here anymore.

**It would be great to get exact instructions on how to add a new device to II.**
Did i overlook something or is it really such a hassle? Cant be...

That's a bug that was reported to the team this week. If you sign-in with nns.ic0.app, the link top right should redirect to identity.ic0.app and not identity.internetcomputer.org. I think a fix will be proposed in next version.

Any idea on how long it will take to be fixed ? + -
And possibly remove or update the online tutorials for new people coming in.

I'm not sure but I noticed a PR, so I guess it should be proposed in this or next proposal.

I'm not sure what do you mean but, sounds like something out of my reach anyway. :wink:
