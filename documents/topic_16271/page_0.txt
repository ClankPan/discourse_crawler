Do we have names for ICP subunits like we have gwei and satoshis? If not, is there a reason for this? I think it makes sense to have named fractional units, especially if we believe the price of ICP will be substantially higher in the future. Imagine a podcaster saying on a livechat, Thanks for the 0.01 ICP. Doesn't sound as good as, Thanks for the 10,000 satoshi. 
I suggest listing ten important contributors to the IC and honoring them by naming subdivisions to the tenth decimal after them. I imagine the most important spots will be 0.01 and 0.001 ICP. 
Any other suggestions? Apologies if this has been discussed before in the forum.

So far we use `e8s` for the smallest unit that you can use because it's 1e-8 of a full ICP. I'm not aware of any other ones

Another possibility, since judging who to honor might get controversial, is using bands that are known by their initials. Since ICP is often taken as Insane Clown Posse. 
Something like 
1 ICP = 10 ELOs
1 ELO = 10 REMs
1 REM = 10 CCR
1 CCR = 10 TLC
Not sure if the names will stick. Anyway, throwing it in there.
