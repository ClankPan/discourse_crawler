I'm unsure what I'm doing wrong here.

I am able to deploy fine using `--no-wallet` as that is how I've setup the canister with the deploying principal set as the controller. Why is the `--no-wallet` being flagged as invalid syntax in this case?

First off, as a rule of thumb you can just drop `--no-wallet` since a few versions of dfx ago. The `--no-wallet` flag has been made the default and therefore it has no effect anymore in most cases. Commands that require a wallet will tell you that you should use `--wallet`.

Because `dfx deploy` does not accept the same arguments as `dfx canister` (anymore? I don't remember the exact history). By default it uses your own principal to make the requests. Only when using `--wallet <wallet id>` it makes the wallet do the request.

My best guess is that either you'd want to run `dfx canister --wallet <your wallet id here> --network ic status --all`. (You can find your wallet id with `dfx identity get-wallet`). Alternatively, you may be using the wrong identity, which is not a controller.
