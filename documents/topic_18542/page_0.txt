When I deploy locally, the app works fine. When I try to deploy on the IC, I get an error, which costs me valuable ICP. Help before I become bankrupt!!!

Hi, before you deploy the frontend canister to IC, you can run 'npm run build' to verify if your frontend can compile successfully.

I'm also getting a similar error. Any help regarding this issue would be greatly appreciated:

@Severin answered a similar [question](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-warn-you-seem-to-be-running-an-outdated-version-of-dfx-but-i-have-latest-version-installed-0-12-1/18554/6?u=peterparker) (I think) and pointed to this [answer]https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-deploy-locally-with-a-new-dfx-identity/16470/24?u=peterparker).

Can it be the answer here too?

When I run "npm run build", I get the following. I also have 4 problems show up in my tsconfig.json file, which I show at the bottom of this reply.

I looked it over and there are some parallels but I really don't want to try everything on that post. I usually fall down a rabbit hole that is hard to get out of. I can deploy this project locally. Moreover, I've deployed other projects locally and on the IC. Only this project doesn't go on the IC.

Maybe you can compare these projects that succeed with your project that does not work and find your issue?

Is you project configured to generate the did files with `dfx generate`?

What version of dfx is used in this project?

Sorry I cannot be really more precise because the issue finds place in your particular project. Not sure I will find time today but if your project is open source and provided with instructions, I can try to check it out and build it.

I'm using dfx 0.9.3. When I run "dfx generate":
blah@DESKTOP-LD764BH:~/ic-projects/dkeeper$ dfx generate

You can find my project [here](https://github.com/sameergarach/dkeeper). The project allows a user to make notes and delete them. Good luck on building it!

Oh that's outtdated, that's probably the reason why `dfx generate` does not work.

Are you stuck with the version or do you plan to upgrade?

-------------------------

codesam | 2023-02-24 00:17:21 UTC | #11

I would like to stick with dfx 0.9.3. I tried upgrading before and everything got thrown off. So I went back to rebuilding the project as my instructor instructed.

I see, in that case I unfortunately can not really help more. I am using a newer version of dfx (note I'm not part that team, just using it as you do) and the generation of the declarations has changed which now uses `dfx generate` and which I think would solve the issue you are facing.
