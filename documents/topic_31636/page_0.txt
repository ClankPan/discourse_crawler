I'm trying to debug my motoko code with `debug.print` but the printouts don't show in my local terminal. A few months ago it was working so I can only think the new dfx version requires some special flag to print debug messages. Do I need any special flag when starting dfx?

Nothing has changed. Did you maybe start your local replica in a different terminal?
