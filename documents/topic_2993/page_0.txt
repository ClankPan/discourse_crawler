Hi,

I'd like to have a bunch of cycle transactions to work within the "localhost" mode. How to do so?

My starting point is https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/experimentalcycles 

I'll be looking into this subject for the next couple of hours, but in case you have a demo or some code you can share, that'll highly appreciate it!

Small note: I'd like to say that had a very quick look into Motoko and did a very basic hello world, so I have no experience with Motoko but there seems to have good documentation and the syntax seems approachable or familiar, so my apologies if I should've taken the time before jumping forward to more advanced questions.

Thank you!
