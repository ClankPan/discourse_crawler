Hi community,

Is there a way in motoko to read files through a given path?
More specifically I want to save a .wasm file (as a blob) into a variable through a given file path in my program without getting it from the frontend or other ways. 
Is something like this possible?

Thanks in advance

Not easily, no.

Your best bet would be to write a script that produces a Motoko file with a Blob literal containing the content of the wasm file.
