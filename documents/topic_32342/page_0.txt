Hi everyone, with this post we would like to share with you the highlights of our project Meddle, and more specifically its integration in the ICP ecosystem.

**Project highlights**

Meddle is an industrial IOT platform that simplifies and automates the process of data collection and management.

It permits manufacturing companies and their service-providers to easily connect industrial protocols, collect data and send them to any data destination.

With Meddle, users can easily connect in full autonomy the industrial machines of their company’s plant using the right industrial protocol for each of them.

Immediately, Meddle starts to collect data from the protocols.

You can manage physical and virtual gateways remotely and in real time, monitoring status and workload.

Taking advantage of Meddle's connection with industrial plants, our idea is to create a product that can easily and automatically certify the data supply chain, using ICP blockchain.

**Web3 advantages**

Meddle leverages blockchain technology in order to store and certify data that are retrieved from the sensors of industry machines.

Differently from Web2 DB or Storage, ICP allows to store data and not modify data later so the company has a guarantee that its data is securely stored.

**How is it built**

The canister is developed with Rust leveraging WebAssembly.
Its purpose is to store and retrieve data directly to the Stable Memory (not heap memory for persistence issues).

The frontend is developed in Svelte, using Carbon as Design System.

**Internet Computer superpowers**

Are there any specific Internet Computer features that made this project possible, or maybe better, or easier/faster to build? Describe how you used specific Internet Computer features to enhance the project’s features and user experience.

**Go-To-Market strategy**

Meddle is currently promoted through trade fairs and through our partners offering artificial intelligence services.

We are currently accelerated by several incubators that allow us to expand our network of contacts

**Monetization**

Meddle is currently sold under a SaaS licence.

To industrial companies (B2B) and consulting or service providers (such as companies doing analytics or machine learning)

**Status of the project**

Right now the project is developed as described above. It’s fully functional and it stores data directly from Meddle to ICP ecosystem.

The current feature

**Resources**

Github repo: https://github.com/quinck-io/meddle-icp-be/tree/main

**Future Plans**

Right now there are no specific guards that limits the usage of the canister to Meddle off-chain technology.
We will write a mechanism that limits the usage of the canister calls to and only to Meddle in order to guarantee the data written come from specific devices retrieved from Meddle environment.


Thank you for reading, hope you enjoyed this brief introduction for our project!

Congratulations!

If I wanted to build the project from your GitHub repo, what should I do? Your readme is very minimal.

Do you have a demo that can be seen somewhere?

Hi Joseph, thank you for your interest!
At the moment we haven't released a demo yet, but we're planning in near future.
If you want to check further informations, we got a brief highlight and code walkthrough uploaded on youtube in Meddle's project channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmnFh_Jiljo
