Hi all,

There is a new [Internet Identity upgrade proposal](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131052) that includes a minor breaking change in the verifiable credentials flow for relying parties.

The breaking change is that the issuer's canister id used to be optional and is now mandatory. The changes were added in [PR 2532](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/pull/2535).

**Necessary changes:**

If you are using the [SDK for relying parties](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/verifiable-credentials) version 0.0.2, you don't need to do anything.

If you are using 0.0.1, we recommend you to upgrade to 0.0.2 which already forces the parameters for typescript users. If you use plain JS, please remember to pass the `issuerData.canisterId` along with the `issuerData.origin`.

If you are implementing the VC flow yourself, you'll need to pass the `canisterId` within the `issuer` parameter when sending the [Request VC as defined in the spec](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#2-request-a-vc).

Don't forget to [vote](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131052) and have a great weekend!
