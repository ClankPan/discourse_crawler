```rust 
// 
#[ic_cdk::update]
pub async fn get_payload_from_my_server(

  let url = "https://1.2.3.4:8002/file/file/ret_to_res_body/payload_02.json";
  let request = CanisterHttpRequestArgument {
    url: url.to_string(),
    max_response_bytes: None, //optional for request
    method: HttpMethod::POST,
    headers: Vec::new(),
    body: None,
    transform: None, //optional for request

  let cycles = 1 * TERA;

  match http_request(request, cycles).await {
    Ok((response,)) => {
      let mut str_body = String::from_utf8(response.body)
        .expect("Transformed response is not UTF-8 encoded.");
      str_body = str_body.replace("\\", "");
      str_body

      let message =
      format!("The http_request resulted into error. RejectionCode: {r:?}, Error: {m}");
      message
    }
  }
}

```

 `dfx canister call backend get_payload_from_my_server `

return: 

 "The http_request resulted into error. RejectionCode: SysTransient, Error: Connecting to 1.2.3.4 failed: Request failed direct connect error trying to connect: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer and connect through socks error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known",

Given that IPv6 is required for HTTP outcalls, I would guess that's why it fails with `1.2.3.4`. However, based on your stack trace, it also seems the SSL certificate is not recognized for your call.

Yes. i use self ssl certification:

this cmd can get respon.body data :  
wget -v -O- https://<a_ip_v4_addr>:8002/file/file/ret_to_res_body/
payload_02.json --no-check-certificate

-------------------------

allright. i will try to get a ipv6 addr firstly

-------------------------

The higher problem is that i actually want to send a file to my rust  canister on ic. 
Only get this solution yet. If there is any better way will be great.

Don't know about your use case, just wanted to shared the above information given it seemed related to the error you were facing.

Solved by learning this code hah.

Gotcha. Funny enough it's the same approach I had to implement in my "Juno <> OpenAI" demo to pass a file to the Vision Preview API.

Great to hear you solved it!
