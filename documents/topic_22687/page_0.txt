Lately I’ve been considering various factors that contribute to the sustainability of the supply of $ICP - one of which is staking, and in turn the yield correlated to it.

The current APY Scale can be found below;

6 Months - 8.9%

1 Year - 9.4%

2 Years - 10.5%

3 Years - 11.5%

4 Years - 12.6%

5 Years - 13.6%

6 Years - 14.7%

7 Years - 15.7%

8 Years - 16.7%

Information provided can be cross referenced at:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance

This depicts that 6 Month Neurons are incentivized at 53% of the rate of 8 Year Neurons (8.9%/16.7%), while having the staking obligation of 6.25% of an 8 Year Neuron (6 months/96 months).

Additionally, a pattern that can be noticed within the staking reward scale, is that each additional year of staked time, results in about a 1% increase in rewards - however, the base layer of rewards, is 8.9% for only a 6 month timeframe.

This raises the question: should short term staking incentivization be reduced to create a more even playing field in correlation to long term staking?

It was a joke from the beginning to change the linear distribution to something removing risks for short time locked neurons.

I would vote anytime to come back to initial condition and fix it forever.

I think providing committed, long term stakeholders a larger maturity distribution is probably warranted (even if it means reducing short term rewards). I did not hold this opinion the last few years; but, I don’t think we’re going to be attracting a bunch of retail anytime soon. It’s probably better to make sure we support the current community. Just my $.02 on the matter.

mechaquan | 2023-09-07 15:28:10 UTC | #4

Completely support this… 

Considering I can get +5% from my bank now with zero lock I’m not sure what incentive there is for anyone to lock for 8 years.

Less locked = more risk… so mitigate that risk by offering better incentives… simple!

Pretty much from Genesis, 8 year stakers have been suggesting that their already disproportionately large rewards ought to get even more disproportionately large. I think Kyle Langham made an elaborate proposal along these lines back in 2021 or early 2022.
The entire tokenomics of long-term staking is built on a fallacious premise. Squeezing liquidity only results in easy market manipulation by whales and a loss of reputation based on that manipulation. Considering ICP faced exactly such manipulation at Genesis, I'm shocked people haven't learned the lesson. ICP will rise rationally if network usage grows to a sufficient level, that is the *only* metric that matters for the price long-term. The rest is just stuff dreamed up by cryptographers who do not understand economics or markets.

I’ll take the heat for that one too since we were coauthors.  That proposal served its purpose, which was to stimulate conversation about whether the tokenomics parameters were optimized to attract genesis neurons to increase their dissolve delay instead of dissolving.  The discussion was actually very civilized back then and in the end we didn’t pursue the proposal based on community feedback.  The proposal we submitted was actually to table (US version meaning to delay or set aside) the proposal.  It passed, which means the community didn’t want changes at the time.  I’m interested in seeing how this discussion develops today.  I don’t think I would vote for it today simply because the 8YG can now greatly outvote the <4YG.  Back then the genesis neurons had the vote advantage and could have stopped the proposal if they felt it wasn’t in their best interest.

How have you come to the conclusion an 8 Year neuron APY disproportionate in comparison to a 6 month neuron APY? 

This article has depicted the exact opposite, showcasing 6 month neuron’s receive 53% of the reward rate at 6.25% of the risk. If anything, 6 month neuron rewards are largely disproportionate in comparison to 8 year stakes, with 16x less risk while still receiving half rewards.

If that was truly the case, nobody in their right mind would have staked for 8 years, would they?

It's obvious that rewards are disproportionate for anyone with a working set of eyeballs and a brain.

Anyone who staked for 8 years has other reasons to do so - like forced hold (up to the point where IDgeek launched), potential for future SNS airdrops or other future NNS benefits.

Please keep in mind there was a (short) time where you could earn 70%+ APY on an 8 Year Neuron.

There’s also a period in which we *regularly* earned 30% APY on an 8 Year Neuron.

There’s also the fact that a lot of neurons got assigned lock ups upon Genesis.

There’s different factors that could have led to how it occured, but nonetheless, the data shows that the reward to risk rate is extremely unbalanced.

Yeah it’s pretty clear there is no real incentive to stake for 8 years at current apy levels.

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-09-09 16:22:30 UTC | #14

The trajectory of rewards was crystal clear at Genesis. As for new stakers potentially finding 16.7% compounded too paltry, is that kind of interest is being handed out liberally in other sectors?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-09 16:28:56 UTC | #15

Nobody is saying 16.7% is too small of an APY - however it is being said that it’s disproportionately scaled in comparison to a 6 Month Neuron. 

You have to stake 6 Months for ~9% APY, yet 8 Years for ~17% APY. 

That is 16x less risk for 53% of the reward.

If the goal is to incentivize long term stakers, then long term stakes should be more lucrative than short term stakes.

I went back to the article we shared when this idea was first raised in Nov 2021 to look at data back then.  At the time, the 8YG was earning 30.3% APY and the 6MG was earning 16.5% APY.  This was roughly the same ratio as today (6MG APY / 8YG APY = 54%).  At the time, these were projected returns assuming all voting power in the NNS voted on all proposals.  The Governance proposal topic was still included in All Topics at the time, so this data applied to all neurons due to genesis default following.  

This 6MG / 8YG APY ratio will hold true indefinitely as long as the max dissolve delay bonus is 2x and the max age bonus is 1.25x.

It's also not possible to set parameters where this APY ratio is equal to the dissolve delay ratio (6 mo / 8 yr = 6.25%).  The dissolve delay bonus converges to infinity for this to work out, which of course is not realistic.  There will always be an apparent disconnect between APY ratio and risk that is characterized by dissolve delay ratio.  The parameters we chose to present at the time were max dissolve delay bonus of 8x and max age bonus of 2x, which we calculated would result in 43.9% APY for 8YG and 7.8% APY for 6MG, which is a 6MG APY / 8YG APY ratio of 17.7%.

Anyway, let me know if you think this data is not germane to the discussion and I will be happy to edit so it doesn't create confusion.

We can argue about what the data means all day but in the end the reality is there is less and less stakers and holders every day. 

I personally think staking should be fixed in opposite direction. We should just get rid of 8 year gang all together and move everyone to a max of 4 years.

Staking rewards should be lowered all around and min lock up should be a month.

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-09-10 11:19:56 UTC | #21

The long term stakers **mainly** don’t sell their rewards, but rather restake them (as ICP or even directly as maturity). The short term ones are the « less » invested/involved ones in the protocol and by consequence don’t hesitate to sell a maximum of rewards.

Of course, I don’t condemn the will of selling, but basically (and one could say « caricaturally ») : the more rewards the short term stakers get, the more there is a selling pressure, and the more rewards the long term stakers get, the more icp are not even minted (because staked as maturity). For example, I personally did never sell any reward. 

So the question is : « what kind of behavior do we wan’t to incentivize between staking and selling ? » Or to say it differently : « how much selling pressure do we want, (as we want some selling pressure because none selling pressure would be problematic of course) ? »

In a way, the long term stakers are like « burners » of ICP through their rewards, the short term stakers are rather minters. So, is the ratio burn/mint satisfying in the DAO’s opinion, and if not, what rhythm would be preferable and why ? (It worth noting that in some context, selling pressure would be preferable to staking, to increase the money’s velocity. If everybody indefinitely stake, we would face some struggling. It is just a question of context. I say this to tell that **the question is not just about absolutely promoting staking rather than selling**, since I could sound as a promoter of « everybody has to stake every icp forever »).

If less selling pressure is wanted, a possibility is : reduce the APY of the short term stakers to reach another 6MG APY / 8YG APY ratio. But maybe the ratio we currently have is already the best one to have for now.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-09 22:35:46 UTC | #22

I think we just need to simplify the process. No one wants to figure out the rules.

Honestly copying hex was prob a bad idea from the start

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-10 03:58:52 UTC | #23

Is the difference really 16x the risk? On the surface it seems that way but if ICP crashes and dies then there's not much difference between a 4 year lock and an 8 year lock. Either way you're most likely not going to get out in time. Hell, even a 6 month lock might not. Tokens have gone -99% in less than a week. Things are a lot more complex than a simple linear increase in "risk." Therefore I don't think it's appropriate to use only linear time in your analysis. What other metrics could one include to get a more accurate picture of whether the reward is fair?

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-10 07:40:38 UTC | #24

I did some additional thinking and found that if we assume that [risk scales with the square root of time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426606000070#:~:text=Many%20financial%20applications%2C%20such%20as,root%20of%20the%20time%20horizon.), rather than linear time, the calculation looks a lot different.

sqrt(0.5) ​≈ 0.71
sqrt(8) ​≈ 2.83

Using square root scaling, the time increase is calculated as follows:

2.83/0.71 ​≈ 4

So under square root risk scaling, the risk is only 4 times greater, rather than 16 times greater using linear scaling. The reward difference remains about 1.9x higher for 8 years. 

While that looks a lot better, it's still a significant gap. But there are other factors we can include that will make the disparity even lower. For example, age bonus and daily compounding.

With the max age bonus after 4 years and rewards compounded daily, a 6 month neuron gives 11.64% APY (**not APR**, since we're compounding) and an 8 year neuron gives 23.59%. Square root time increase remains at 4, and the reward increases to ≈ 2.03x, up from 1.9x.

There are other things to consider that are difficult to put an exact number on, like the value of voting power, i.e. the ability to control changes to the network. Furthermore, keep in mind that if investors do expect the price to increase over time (why would they invest otherwise?) the compounded returns are much greater with a higher APY which could close the gap even further. Can anyone think of other factors we can include in this analysis?

-------------------------

Berg | 2023-09-10 07:59:50 UTC | #25

You can potentially get out in time if you sell your Internet Identity on IDgeek for a discount. Say, you sell your 6 month neuron for 3% discount (or your 8 year neuron for 7%-10% discount) and ICP crashes 50% 1 month later.

As soon as IDgeek was released, the concept of risk in staking has changed quite dramatically. Therefore, as anyone with locked neurons can exit basically whenever (and re-enter whenever by rebuying lower on exchanges), current rewards might actually be greater than necessary - and 6-month neurons are obsolete imo.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-10 08:15:30 UTC | #26

You're right, that's a great thing to consider as well and completely throws the ability to quickly estimate risk and fairness of these rewards out of the window. In fact, it may be the wrong approach to try to calculate this at all. A better solution might be to look at the outputs rather than the inputs and make adjustments from there. In other words, is the amount of ICP flowing in to higher dissolve delay neurons increasing or decreasing? Perhaps a system where the long and short term rewards automatically vary depending on how much ICP is being locked up long term in the past X days/week/months would help accomplish the goal of encouraging longer lock-ups.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-09-10 08:22:52 UTC | #27

As far as I know you can't use geek to sell your II if you set a recovery phrase and with current updates that can no longer be removed. So unless you plan doing that it is not really an option for the masses. Also why is nobody talking about the minimum lock up period of 6 mo. In order to get a 6 mo reward you need to start dissolving after 6 months and such you have your tokens locked for a year but only get rewards for half so you need to split the numbers.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-12 14:38:28 UTC | #28

Thank you for your thoughtful insights; they provide valuable alternative perspectives on the substantial gap in staking rewards highlighted in the initial article. However, it's important to explore these points more deeply, as they may not completely alleviate the original concern.

**Square Root Risk Scaling:** 

The concept of square root risk scaling offers an intriguing approach to assessing risk, one that appears to temper the perceived disparity between short and long-term staking. While this perspective is noteworthy, it's essential to underscore that it doesn't entirely eliminate the core concern. Even with this adjusted method, there remains a discernible difference in rewards between short and long-term staking periods. The square root model may indeed soften the perceived risk gap, but it doesn't obliterate it. Investors still encounter significant variations in reward structures based on their chosen lock-up period.

**Age Bonus and Daily Compounding:** 

The inclusion of age bonuses and daily compounding undoubtedly provides a more intricate understanding of how staking rewards accrue over time. However, it's crucial to emphasize that these mechanisms are integral components of the current reward system. Acknowledging their influence does narrow the gap between short and long-term staking, but it's vital to remember that this doesn't entirely resolve the initial concern regarding disparity. While it highlights the subtleties within the reward structure, it doesn't eliminate the core issue of divergent rewards based on lock-up durations.

**Value of Voting Power:** 

Recognizing the significance of voting power in governance decisions is a valid point. Nevertheless, precisely quantifying its impact on rewards and risk remains a formidable challenge. The value of voting power can fluctuate significantly, contingent upon the governance structure of the network and the extent of influence wielded by individual stakeholders. While it underscores an additional dimension of staking, it doesn't directly address the fundamental concern of varying rewards linked to lock-up durations.

Concluding, your insights offer alternative angles and enrich the conversation, but they don't fully mitigate the initial apprehension regarding the substantial disparity in reward rates. 

The central question persists: does the existing reward structure align with incentivizing long term staking?

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-09-12 16:13:51 UTC | #29

Dear @Accumulating.icp,

What would be your own answer to your question ? Would you be in favor of reducing short term staking incentivization while letting the long term staking one as it is ? Reducing both ? In both cases, which ratio would you recommend ? Something like this ?

[quote="wpb, post:17, topic:22687"]
The parameters we chose to present at the time were max dissolve delay bonus of 8x and max age bonus of 2x, which we calculated would result in 43.9% APY for 8YG and 7.8% APY for 6MG, which is a 6MG APY / 8YG APY ratio of 17.7%.
[/quote]

Regards

PS : given the other topic you initiated and Kyle’s statement there saying the selling pressure comes mainly from neurons’ rewards and dissolving rather than from NP, a new ratio could be a way to reduce this part of the inflation, I mean if short term stakers tend to sell more than long term ones.

I genuinely didn’t plan on saying, as whenever I give my perspective, it gets framed as though I am “building a narrative” or a “bad actor” - so I was content simply starting the conversation & chiming in where I found interest. 

However, given you’ve asked, I’d be in favour of a couple changes;

1. Redefining the scaling ratio of APY to significantly incentivize long term staking over short term staking

2. Lowering the maximum APY to create more sustainable tokenomics (as burn rate is extremely low in comparison to what we print)

Hello everyone ! I would like to give an opinion with relevant points if you can take them into consideration.

* It is very important to motivate and encourage people to block the neuron for longer.
* I think that currently the benefit of blocking for 8 years is little in relation to the amount of time one supports the blockchain.
* We currently have a reward base of 16.8% per 8-year lock and a reward base of 9.5% per 1-year lock. The reward should be reduced in neurons that block 1 year and increased in those that block 8 years.
* The idea that occurs to me is to reduce the rewards (neurons less than 4 years of blockage) and add them from neurons with blockages of more than 4 years.

Example:

Days || APR

1 - 365 - > %5 (now 9.5%) | Lose 4.5 %
365 - 730 → % 7 (now 10.5%) | Lose 3.5 %
730 - 1095 → % 9 (now 11.5%) | Lose 2.5 %
1095 - 1460 → % 11.6 (now 12.6 % ) | Lose 1 %

1460 -1825 - → 14.7 (now 13.7 % ) | Gain 1 %
1825- 2190 → 16.7 (now 14.7 % ) | Gain 2 %
2190- 2555 → 18.8 (now 15.8 % ) | Gain 3 %
2555 -2919 → %20.8 (now 16.8% ) | Gain 4 %
2920 (8year) → %22.3 (now 16.8% ) | Gain 5.5 % ( Plus 1.5 %)

Added to this is the bonus for age, which would work the same as now.

I know it’s a simple idea. But it is better to make minor and simple changes, since making them more complex I think would harm rather than help.

Thx !

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-09-12 16:46:04 UTC | #35

Thank you for this.

Look forward to knowing more about this. 

I am open to the idea of attracting more investors by lowering the min. lock. and make them trying the staking/governing, **but if the rewarding ratio is not also revised, we will just increase the minting of ICP and selling pressure**, because the shorter the term of staking is, the more the staker tend to mint and sell at the market price at the time of minting.

Redefining the scaling ratio of APY to significantly incentivize long term staking over short term staking
[/quote]

Long-term staking is already significantly incentivized over short-term staking. That is why such a large amount of ICP is locked up in 8 year neurons. 
To provide additional incentives to long-term staking, there would need to be some proof that the stated aim of getting the long-term stake to 90% is actually a good goal. I think the opposite is the case, a 90% long-term lock-in would be very bad indeed. But it is just taken for granted by the 8 year gang that the more long-term staking there is, the better. 
It has always been clear to me that people making such proposals are not thinking of incentivizing new investors to stake for long periods. They are motivated solely by a desire to boost the APY they receive for neurons that are already staked. They staked for 8 years knowing the inflation trajectory and want to change rules after the game has started. Well, the NNS is built in a way that all rules can be changed. So, I don't blame 8 year stakers for wanting to grab a bigger share of the pie. Everyone wants to maximise their personal gains, nothing wrong in that. By all means leverage that extra voting power to get more rewards. But let's not pretend it is to set right some injustice or for the betterment of the ecosystem.

This article has shown that the reward rate is not proportionate or linear at all. I have provided the data to showcase this, although if you have contradicting data, I would appreciate if you provided it. However, simply saying, “no trust me, it’s fair - believe me” doesn’t make it so.

I’m not sure where you’ve seen that I think APY should be raised. That is actually the opposite of my standpoint - we have an issue with inflation, and a lack of tokens being burnt to compensate. 

I’ve stated I believe APY should be re-scaled, incentivizing long term stakes over short term (as short term stakes are much more lucrative, given the lack of lockup for similar reward rates) - however this does not equate to increasing inflation or APY.

If you continued reading past where you quoted, you would see where I said this:

Utilizing your own logic, the point could be made that you’re so aggressively defending short term staking APY due to the fact that you intend to maximize personal gains - recognizing the over incentivization associated with them. But I won’t. 

So, I’d appreciate if you laid off on the unfounded accusations, and let me get back to fixing shit🤠

Yeah it’s pretty clear there is no real incentive to stake for 8 years at current apy levels.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:15, topic:22687"]
If the goal is to incentivize long term stakers, then long term stakes should be more lucrative than short term stakes.
[/quote]

Thanks @wbp, for your defence. Greatly appreciated.

I'm just going to leave a few quotes from the conversation here and people can judge if the issue is solely about reducing the APY for short term stakers or increasing it for long-term stakers.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:37, topic:22687"]
Utilizing your own logic, the point could be made that you’re so aggressively defending short term staking APY due to the fact that you intend to maximize personal gains
[/quote]

Of course I do. I do not claim to be an investor for charitable purposes. The difference is that in my case I invested based on certain promises made. Of course, the NNS allows those promises to be changed, which I also knew, and played into my decision not to stake for the longest term.

I got a notification you quoted me so I’ll just say that I stand by my statement but I respect your right to disagree.

You could have just let @Denis say is opinion and let it be part of the conversation without confrontation.
[/quote]

Given he quoted me, rather accusatorially at that, it is completely reasonable that I respond. 

On the other hand, you had no part to play in this conversation, and quite clearly have interjected yourself to assert your moral high ground & frame a narrative of character. Very transparent - not a good look.

 
[quote="wpb, post:38, topic:22687"]
He doesn’t need you to tell him why he holds his opinion. That doesn’t help the conversation.
[/quote]

Surely you can appreciate the irony, right?

I responded to him because he asserted what my opinions are, yet when I showcase the irony in his logic you try to use it as some type of “gotcha” moment.

You quite clearly have a bias within this conversation, that I’m not going to entertain further. Stop trying to be a moderator.

You’re quoting other people, and portraying it as though it is my opinion, or as though there is some type of collusion.

This is beyond intellectually dishonest - I have started a conversation, and people have responded to it, with their own opinions.

Additionally, just because people agree that it is not proportional does not equate to increasing inflation (I’m not sure why I have to keep repeating this part).

I quoted most who had posted, you included, to prove my point. Never suggested collusion, never thought there was any collusion going on, nothing dishonest about it.

I've made the point I wanted to make, take it or leave it, makes little difference to me.

Your “point” was quite clearly that I raised this topic for personal gain, in an attempt to raise my own APY. 

You then provided quotes from other individuals within this conversation to “prove” something you’re claiming about me.

It makes no sense to make these claims - so again, please lay off the unfounded accusations & let me get back to fixing shit🤠

I have repeatedly said we are all here for personal gain, myself included, I do not think that is a bad impulse at all. And I did not specify anything about you except as part of a wider group, I don't know why you are choosing to take this personally.

Anyway, I should not have returned to this forum, it was a mistake. I remember seeing a thread about deleting accounts but cannot find it. If I recall correctly, certain site mods can do it. Apologies for putting the here instead of the appropriate thread, but @diegop could I request you to delete my Dfinity forum account when you have time?

I responded originally, as you quoted me, implying you’re speaking about my statement, then proceeded to claim that this topic was raised for personal gain when it’s been shown that’s not the case.

I am not sure why you so consistently assert this narrative upon me when I have made it very clear I am in favour of decreasing inflation & APY in general.

I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll note that I have some direct experience in trying to enact something like this(for better or worse):

1. I absolutely think that the curve for the voting power bonus should be exponential in nature.

2. Given that there are(I think) still some approved proposals that have taken more than a year and still have not been implemented I'm hesitant to reduce the minimum staking at which you get rewards below six months. In a perfect "skin in the game" world you'd be locked until at least the things you approve have been enacted. That is not practical, so we use time periods to keep it simpler...but I'm really not in favor of 1 day unless there is actually a negative bonus below a certain point(and it is negative exponential)...even then I'm tempted to say it breaks long term optimal decision making at the aggregate network level.

3. If you are going to change it you should either grandfather in existing neurons or let everyone dissolve and restake.  Given the current economic conditions, I'd say grandfathering would be the way to go, but you'd likely have to remove automatic restaking for those grandfathered neurons.

I agree.  They started when you attacked @Denis for no good reason.  If you keep attacking people when they contribute to the conversation, then you will continue getting one sided feedback.  Just let it go when people say something that rubs you the wrong way.  You will be more successful engaging community discussion if you avoid accusations, anger, and angst.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-14 01:14:49 UTC | #50

Attacked? You need to take a serious look at your critical thinking skills. 

Your narratives are unproductive to the conversation & detract from your reputation as a governance contributor - what is the purpose of your comments other than attempting to reprimand me? You’re beyond transparent. 

Your lack of preaching of this “anger angst accusation” to those of whom actually actively fall within this category, such as @Denis & his unfounded accusations, transparently showcase your bias.

I’d appreciate if you stopped attempting to circumvent this topic, as you have so frequently done with spam comments that take conversations off-topic in the past.

[quote="Denis, post:36, topic:22687"]
It has always been clear to me that people making such proposals are not thinking of incentivizing new investors to stake for long periods. They are motivated solely by a desire to boost the APY they receive for neurons that are already staked. They staked for 8 years knowing the inflation trajectory and want to change rules after the game has started. Well, the NNS is built in a way that all rules can be changed.
[/quote]



I think we all need to think about the current situation. 

We have a really unattractive unnecessarily risky staking/governance system.  We can all think of cool ways forcing people to be long term investors but in the state ICP is currently in only crazy people would be long term investors. 

We need to lower the risk to be a part of this community and make everything more attractive to the average crypto investor.

Im sure a lot of people who drank some really good coolaid will tell me that they don't want crypto people, to that i say same thing I always say. Don't worry if we keep things the way they are no one will join to mess up your safe space. 

It will be all 30 community devs and dfinity employees pretending they are making something until the token collapses.

This is my point.

LOWER THE MAX STAKING TO 4 YEARS.

I agree, I am transparent.  I will always stand up for civilized conversation.

My intent is not to reprimand, but rather to encourage you to think about how you talk to people and how it impacts the conversation.  You have the ability to make strong governance contributions, but you tend to undermine your own capability with wild accusations and angry responses.  Just relax and let other people have an opinion that is different than your own.

ai, the time change to a day ,let the icp price become true .we choose ourselves again the staking time (apy reset)

-------------------------

superduper | 2023-09-15 00:52:07 UTC | #55

why can't this be market based.  if icp prices keeps going down over 4 week period the short term should offer higher rate (curve more flat/elastic), if prices going up the curve is less flat (inelastic).  u can use the same modulation logic that is used for the maturity pay outs perhaps as that tracks price over some time period as I recall.
