As far as I understand, calling an actor constructor creates a canister inside the current network.

How to create a new canister outside the current network?

What are use cases of canisters outside the current network?

Right now there's only the way via the [cycles minting canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai) and by using the ICP -> canister flow. I'm working on the changes needed to also allow that via cycles.

I know e.g. HotOrNot at some point started to get close to filling up their subnet so they decided to start deploying new user canisters to a different subnet so they don't hit the limit. But it's pretty rare that you _want_ to be distributed over different subnets. Maybe also when you want to have a faster connection to a canister on another subnet you can deploy to the same subnet as that service and aggregate responses there before you make a lot of cross-subnet calls
