Hi all,

Can someone explain to me what these metrics from ic-api are returning and how often they are refreshed etc. My guess is `latest-reward-event-total-available` and `last-reward-event` are returning e8 equivalent of the rewards sent to neurons but I have no information about this such as for how many days etc when is it refreshed anything else? Also this is a little confusing too because i was assuming they are all e8 values but when i checked `average-last-reward-event` it gave me a string like this: "104855980.6260475", so i'm wondering what is this number exactly with a floating point.

The API's i'm looking at are:

https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/metrics/latest-reward-event-total-available
https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/metrics/average-last-reward-event
https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/metrics/last-reward-event

I am trying to calculate APY similar to how the governance part of the [dashboard works](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance).
