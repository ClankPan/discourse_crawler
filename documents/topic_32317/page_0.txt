At present, a very large number of ICP users are fud, everyone is pointing out the ICP shortcomings, I summarize it as the following three aspects of the problem:
1. The user experience is too poor, especially in the wallet and DEX
2. Lack of project liquidity, especially for SNS projects, most of the SNS projects have financed a lot of ICP, but only added a few LPs.
3. DFinity's marketing is problematic. Although Dfinity has made a lot of changes, such as the HUB program, it feels that it has not found where the problem really lies.


My comments on the above issues:
1. suggest DFinity to set up a working group to strengthen the guidance on the development of ICP infrastructure DAPP to make its user experience feel more.
2. reduce the funding for new projects, many projects are not developed after accepting the grant money, Dfinity wastes a lot of money on it.
3. Increase investment in promotion and publicity. Set up a marketing working group composed of Dfinity staff, community KOLs, and take a portion of the grant money for new projects to invest in the part of the community members are most interested in, especially focusing on DEFI (MEME tokens).
4.Change your mindset, recognize your current user base (cryptocurrency enthusiasts), communicate with the community, understand the community's user needs, and take one step at a time to implement WEB3
