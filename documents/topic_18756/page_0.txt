I am trying to configure alternative origin("https://icevent.app") for canister https://znisf-eqaaa-aaaaj-aabta-cai.raw.ic0.app/  by following instruction https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/internet-identity/alternative-origins#configuring-alternative-origins , but it doesn't show the origin as document when I try to login with domain ("icevent.app"), still get the different principal.

my configurations as below, anyone can help me?

Set the `derivationOrigin` to the original domain. 
[InternetIdentityAuthRequest ii-spec](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/ii-spec.md#client-authentication-protocol)
[AuthClient login agent-js](https://agent-js.icp.xyz/auth-client/classes/AuthClient.html#login)

doesn't work

      derivationOrigin: "https://znisf-eqaaa-aaaaj-aabta-cai.raw.ic0.app",
      identityProvider: IDENTITY_PROVIDER,
      maxTimeToLive: ONE_WEEK_NS,
      onSuccess: () => handleAuthenticated(authClient),
    });

Are you using dfx and if yes, did you proceed with the all configuration including the chapter " Configuring Your Asset Canister"

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/internet-identity/alternative-origins#configuring-your-asset-canister

Good.

Also https://znisf-eqaaa-aaaaj-aabta-cai.raw.ic0.app/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins seems ok.

Final piece, did you pass the derivation origin to agent-js?

```
await authClient.login({
        ...
        derivationOrigin: "https://your-url.ic0.app"
```

where `https://your-url.ic0.app` is the original domain used to sign-in - i.e. the domain you want to use to get the same principal

yes, like this

> ```
> authClient.login({
> ```

```
  derivationOrigin: "https://znisf-eqaaa-aaaaj-aabta-cai.raw.ic0.app",
  identityProvider: IDENTITY_PROVIDER,
  maxTimeToLive: ONE_WEEK_NS,
  onSuccess: () => handleAuthenticated(authClient),
});
```

What version of agent-js are you using?
Did you re-deploy?

When I go to https://icevent.app/ and open and debug II, I can notice that no `derivationOrigin` is passed.

So either agent-js is not well configured, or not redeployed or it does not pass the information but that's where the issue is I think.

Out of curiosity, you mean dfx?

Glad to hear it worked out üëç

bytesun | 2023-03-01 15:20:56 UTC | #12

No, my dfx is 0.12.1, but agent.js was old 0.11
