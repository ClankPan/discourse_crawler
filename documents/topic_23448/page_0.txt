Is there an explorer repo available that can be used to create an explorer like page for ICRC1 tokens? I've seen that there is a page on dashboard.internetcomputer.org that let's one see the most recent transactions of an SNS token. However, I think it's not possible to be listed on there as a custom token that didn't go through SNS.

Since all SNS tokens (and any tokens following ICRC1) have the same standard, it could make sense to have a repo that anyone could use as their own explorer or a central explorer page that shows all info about an ICRC1 token and its transactions?
