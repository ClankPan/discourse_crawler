# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/80e0363393ea26a36b77e8c75f7f183cb521f67f/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 80e0363393ea26a36b77e8c75f7f183cb521f67f
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Hey @DRE-Team  @sat  @Luka  @pietrodimarco  @msumme  @dmanu  @Manu  @christian  @nikola-milosa

There are a series of excellent questions that have been asked by @Lorimer on the General Public channel of the CodeGov community on OpenChat.  [Here is a link](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/3301574440448421105698593132787817936/17).  I think many of these questions are best answered by the DFINITY team.  Would you please take a look and respond as you think is appropriate?

A little background...Lorimer has become extremely active on Taggr over the last several months as a reviewer for code changes.  Professionally, he is a full stack web2 developer who has become very interested in the web3 movement and IC.  He enjoys reviewing code and web3 governance is one of his favorite topics.  He is familiar with Rust and is further developing experience with it through is reviews of Taggr changes.  It seems there is a good chance that he will become a reviewer for the CodeGov team for the work we do reviewing Replica Version Management proposals or the work we might start doing to review System Canister Management proposals.  At this point, he is feeling his way around NNS governance and trying to better understand IC replica update work process and the role of the CodeGov team.  Hence, any feedback you can provide regarding his questions would be greatly appreciated.  I also plan to ask DFINITY to invite him to the dfinity<>codegov channel on Slack since many of his questions are similar in nature to topics of discussion there in the past as well.

Thanks for your help!

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **129493**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/78) 

Proposal ID: **129494**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/79) 

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @ilbert, and @hpeebles.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here or in the thread of each respective proposal in our community on OpenChat if you have any questions or suggestions about these reviews.
