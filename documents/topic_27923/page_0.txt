## **Allkinds overview**

Allkinds is a social network.
On Allkinds people connect by anonymously asking and answering each other yes/no questions about what ever they consider important. Then people can discover those whose answers resonate the most and connect. 
Once connected people can compare their answers thus learning a lot about each other.

Essentially people connect upon values expressed by themselves through questions in a private manner.

Within this iteration of the project we've launched the MVP where individuals can discover like-minded people within groups. 

We've created a special group for people from this forum: [people from Dfinity forum on allkinds.xyz](https://allkinds.xyz/join/dfinity?invite=dfinity) - please join the group and discover like-minded people on our forum.

## **How Allkinds is different**

Allkinds is a web3 network where people essentially connect upon values. The main reasons why we use web3 are the following:
- keep users' data safe (we want to make sure people own their data)
- Allkinds aimed to be a pure DAO - a product build by people for people
- we plan to issue Allkinds token (this token is essentially backed up by created by people data) to implement a self-sustainable tokenomics.

## **How is it built**

Allkinds' current version is a webapp fully built on the Internet Computer using Motoko and Vue.js. We use the Internet Identity for authenticating users.
Please check [Allkinds Github](https://github.com/AllKinds/AllkindsICP).

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

As a global vision we see Allkinds as a protocol and dapp that will introduce a new term to the Internet - Digital Personality Identity that represents our personality in terms of values, interests, habits and so on in the digital world. Thus we need to build a solution that would be scalable to virtually any size while preserving efficient economy. This aligns with the ICP strategy very well.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

We plan to evolve Allkinds in seasons.
During the first season (we call it Genesis) we want to focus on users that besides getting a value from the service also want to promote, contribute and shape the future of the project. We're planning to accomplish this through personal invites to influencers, inner circle, participation at conferences and promoting the global idea of the project through media.

For the following seasons we can promote Allkinds through:
* direct sales to Teams (companies) and Places (offline businesses) and Events organisers (conferences, hackathons and more) in a particular locations
* media campaigns + invitation system where people get bonuses for inviting new users (though the amount of invites is going to be limited).

## **Monetization**

We are planning to launch SNS.

## **Status of the project**

We just completed a $5K grant from Dfinity to build an MVP. Within this MVP people can create teams and invite members to it. We've launched pilots with a poker startup company (30 members) and some other small groups of people.
We're improving the UX/UI as we getting feedback from users and planning to test a use-case where co-founders match each other at accelerators cohorts.
