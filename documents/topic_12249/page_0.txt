Is there are way to lower/disable the `blockTime` when running the `emulator` /`replica` locally with `dfx`?

The amount of time my test suite takes to complete just grows by minutes every time I add new features, because every update call takes `2000+` ms.

There used to be a `--no-artificial-delay` flag but Iâ€™m not sure if that got removed.

Would it be possible to get this flag back ? 
The only reason invoked there is that it was confusing but the advantages of reducing test time and asset uploading locally far outweigh that.

Could we please get this flag back? We're about to start some pretty intense testing as well, and I would love to get rid of that delay for testing.

I'll ping the team and see if anyone can find the time as we're really busy with SNS. But feel free to ping me again if nothing happened every 2-4 weeks or so.
