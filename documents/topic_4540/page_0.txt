For connecting to the networkd --note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

thread 'replica-actor' panicked at 'Could not start replica.: Os { code: 24, kind: Other, message: "No file descriptors available" }', src/dfx/src/actors/replica.rs:303:29

dfx deploy error: The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 400 Bad Request, content type "text/plain; charset=utf-8", content: Failed to connect to host: No file descriptors available (os error 24)

I use Ubuntu updated version.

This is the last step for competing the beginning steps. I have the version of dfx and node. It just seems I cannot connect to the network and run my first application. Anyone else have this problem?

Maybe try `ulimit -Sn unlimited`.
