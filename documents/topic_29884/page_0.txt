Welcome to the Cerverza Cristal Fan Coin! This is a Memecoin project which is planning to launch an SNS in the near future!

**What is Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin?**

Have you been feeling the Force lately? We have too, especially after that epic Cerveza Cristal ad within a Star Wars movie went viral! In a galaxy far, far away, a new legend is born: Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin.

This ain't your typical crypto. Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin is a hilarious meme coin celebrating the epicness of the Cerverza Cristal commercial and the undeniable thirst it quenched among Star Wars fans. It's a way to join a community of like-minded enthusiasts who appreciate a good laugh, a refreshing cerveza, and of course, the brilliance of the Force (and maybe some marketing genius).

So, whether you're a hardcore Star Wars fanatic or just someone who appreciates a good meme, Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin is your chance to be part of something truly out-of-this-world (and potentially lucrative, who knows?).

**Why doing an SNS?**

The Force is strong with Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin, and so is our desire for a decentralized and community-driven future. That's why we're choosing the Internet Computer (ICP) with its innovative Service Nervous System (SNS) to power our fan coin.

Here's why this is a match made in a galaxy far, far away:

* **Decentralized Decisions**: The SNS allows our community to hold the reins. Through token ownership and voting, YOU will have a say in the future of the Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin. Want to see a limited edition NFT series featuring the commercial's characters? The decision is yours!
* **Fan-Powered Funding**: The SNS on ICP facilitates a fair and transparent way to raise funds for future endeavors. Imagine exclusive contests, merch drops, or even charitable partnerships – all fueled by the collective power of the Cristal fan community.
* **Censorship Resistance**: Just like Han Solo blasting through a Star Destroyer blockade, the ICP with SNS ensures our Fan Coin remains unstoppable. No central authority can manipulate the system, keeping things fair and fun for everyone.
* **Speed and Scalability**: The Internet Computer is known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds. This means no waiting around in a Mos Eisley cantina queue for transactions to clear – just smooth sailing for all our Fan Coin enthusiasts.

**Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin isn't just a meme, it's a community. The SNS on ICP empowers our fans to be a part of something special, something as unique and refreshing as a nice, cold Cristal after a long day battling the Empire (or whatever your daily struggles may be).**

So grab your spacesuit, hop on your X-34 landspeeder (or whatever mode of transportation you prefer), and join the Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin revolution on the Internet Computer!

**Token distribution**

We're all about community ownership, so 50% of the tokens are reserved for the DAO treasury. Here's how the rest breaks down:

* Development Team (10%) – They get some tokens, but they're working hard for the cause (and fueled by CCFC itself, just like you!). 
* SNS Swap (40%) – This is where you get your chance to snag some CCFC! We're aiming to raise some ICP through the swap, which all goes straight to the DAO treasury (more on that later).

The DAO Treasury (50%) is like our community war chest. Here's how we plan to use it:

* DEX & CEX Liquidity (80%): A smooth-flowing market is key – we'll use these funds to make sure buying and selling CCFC is a breeze.
* Marketing & Community (20%): Spreading the word about CCFC and building a vibrant community – that's what this is all about! The DAO will decide how these funds are used.

**How will we use the raised funds?**

Transparency is key in our galactic crypto cantina, so here's a breakdown of how the funds raised through the SNS token sale will fuel the Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin adventure:

*Community First!*

That's right, 100% of the ICP raised will be directed towards the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This means the Cristal fan community holds the purse strings! No team funding here – we're all fueled by the power of the CCFC token itself.

*Liquidity is King (or Queen)*

We understand the importance of a smooth-flowing intergalactic crypto market. That's why a whopping 80% of the raised funds will be used to provide liquidity. This ensures easy buying and selling of CCFC tokens, keeping our fan coin readily available for all the thirsty crypto enthusiasts out there.

*Spreading the Cristal Word*

The Force may be strong, but a little marketing muscle never hurts! 20% of the raised funds will be dedicated to supercharging community-driven marketing activities. Think meme contests, social media blitzes, and anything else the DAO decides will bring the legend of Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin to the farthest corners of the cryptoverse.

*Bonus Level Unlocked!*

Here's where things get truly intergalactic. If the Force is truly with us and we surpass the 20,000 ICP mark, any surplus funds will be invested in building tools that empower the entire ICP Meme Coin ecosystem. Imagine that – the Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin community helping to pave the way for a thriving meme coin scene on the Internet Computer!

The key takeaway? This is your coin, your community, and your chance to be part of something truly out-of-this-world. Join the Cerveza Cristal Fan Coin revolution on the Internet Computer and let's make some waves (or ripples, or maybe just create a galactic thirst for a good meme coin) together!

What is the innovation here

-------------------------

CCFC | 2024-04-23 07:01:38 UTC | #3

Thanks for your interest!

First and foremost and the most honest answer, we are a meme coin project. We've seen how meme coins can bring loads of attention to platforms and even though ICP is much more powerful than that, we want to raise awareness of this ecosystem.

Secondly, we've written that most of the funds will be used to provide liquidity to the token, as this is key to any project but especially for meme coins. If we raise more than 20k ICP, the surplus will be used to **build tools for the meme coin ecosystem on ICP**. These are aggregators, token launch tools, dashboards, etc, all tools that make it easy to launch such a project and browse along them. Those are what have fueled the recent hype on other chains like Solana. These decisions will then be in the hand of the SNS on what to provide primarily.

That's also why **we are not asking for any neuron fund contribution**. Most of the funds will be directly used for liquidity providing. Hope this answers your question :)

So you don’t already develop “memecoins” and you now want an sns? 

Can TENDY get an sns before your random token. Have you considered launching on an amm?

是一个模因币项目。我们已经看到 meme 币如何为平台带来大量关注，尽管 ICP 比这更强大，但我们希望提高人们对这个生态系统的认识。

其次，我们已经写过，大部分资金将用于为代币提供流动性，因为这对任何项目都至关重要，尤其是对于模因币而言。如果我们筹集超过 20k ICP，剩余的资金将用于**为 ICP 上的 Meme 币生态系统构建工具** 。这些是聚合器、代币启动工具、仪表板等，所有工具都可以轻松启动此类项目并浏览它们。这些都助长了 Solana 等其他区块链最近的炒作。然后，这些决定将由 SNS 决定主要提供什么。

I'm going to vote against a project I've never even heard of.

Thanks for your questions! Exactly, we are launching out fresh. As described in the whitepaper and the post above, we want to use 80% of the raised funds for liquidity. This is essential for an meme project's success.

We can't speak for other projects but technically, any project can propose an SNS.
