Iâ€™m looking for someone capable of designing a website on the Internet Computer. My intention is to set up a website for uploading music files and being able to sell them for various purposes. I would like to be able to take USD as well as USDC (or ckUSDC for now) and BTC/ckBTC payments. Is there anyone who is interested in willing to help me with this? I am willing to discuss and negotiate pricing for such a job.
