Feels like I must be missing something. I've gone thru the steps here https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/nacs7c/you_can_use_your_nano_ledger_as_your_physical/

The weird part is it doesn't require authentication to send ICP - just to login. Am I missing something or is this the way it's supposed to work? This is a little concerning to me because *if* my computer was compromised & I was logged in, virus / hacker could send tokens without hardware device confirmation. It feels like I'm missing something here?

Is there a way to set this up to where it requires two device authentication on sends or something?
