I have an actor class that takes an argument. So this actor class is going to have multiple instances, each instantiated with a different argument. When calling an instance of said actor class, what is the syntax for specifying exactly which actor class it is that I wish to call?

I think you can specify the canister ID directly, but there should be a better way..
