Is there somewhere a template provided for Sns proposal?

By this I mean the a template for the text of a `CreateServiceNervousSystem` proposal akin for example to the template provided on the [wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Create_an_NNS_motion_proposal) for motion proposal.

```
# Example Motion Project Proposal

## 1. Objective
Lorem Ipsum

## 2. Background
Lorem Ipsum

## 3. Why this is important
Lorem Ipsum

## 4. Pros
Lorem Ipsum

## 5. Cons
Lorem Ipsum

## 6. Key milestones (if any)
Lorem Ipsum

## 7. Discussion leads (if any)
Alice, Bob, etc...

## 8. Security concerns (if any)
Lorem Ipsum

## 11. What is asked of the community

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

I am not aware of a template.
There is however the SNS documentation, which includes recommendation what information should be contained in such a proposal - for example [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/tokenomics/sns-checklist) in the checklist.

Thanks, Lara. I'm integrating support for the SNS proposal to [proposals.network](https://proposals.network). That's why a template would have been handy—so I can save time building one myself. There are none, well noted.

@peterparker it may not be exactly what you're looking for, but [sns-testing's example sns_inti.yaml](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/example_sns_init.yaml) may be helpful. Additional documentation for the proposal type itself is available in the [proto definition](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/a5467a81f4524c9e337d78fd04a159e9f4dd2ab5/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L4).

Thanks for the links Andre, appreciated. That isn't exactly what I were looking for here. I was rather searching for a template for the content of the proposal (see screenshot) but, I understand that each SNS proposal are different from each other and do not have to follow a template of structure such as motion. Not a blocker, just good to know the answer.

I see, sorry for misunderstanding!

No worries at all! The proto link might particularly be useful one of those days.
