When running the local sns you get the NNS but you don't get the IC dashboard. How can I view the treasury balance of the local SNS and the balance on the DAO controlled neuron after it has been staked.

The staking code can be found here:

Hey @jamesbeadle,

You can call the `account_balance` or `icrc1_balance_of` endpoints of the local ICP ledger canister with the appropriate account id or principal, subaccount pair.
