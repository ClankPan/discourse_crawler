Upload an incorrect binary and have a proposal process that doesn't require/encourage voters enough to verify the binary before voting to adopt.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2023-03-29 03:50:49 UTC | #107

I analyze what is now, defining the scope of what is possible with known data about how the NNS functions and what is the scope of this proposal.

**What is this proposal about:**

* making a one-time fix that is within the scope of the NNS DAO. An opportunity to learn, adapt and develop.

Considering future ramifications that might occur broadens the scope to a point the decision-making process is out of scope and paralyzing.

-------------------------

diegop | 2023-03-29 05:02:37 UTC | #108

I think Dom explained a lot of his thinking in this thread, but I thought I would add some sense of the *sentiment* from DFINITY. 

Based on my conversation with Jan and others, my understanding is the general intent is the proposal is NOT seen as a common way of doing things (or standard for the future), but a rarely-used exception to learn from and we are open for more suggestions on how to minimize cases like this, or how to learn from this. In this sense, @Hazel 's analogy to the ETH DAO hack rhymes with this case (a possible, but rarely-used power used by the consensus of the network).

I say this because:

1. I wanted to clarify that DFINITY does not see this as the norm action or behavior, and future cases may be treated differently

2. I wanted to validate that "slippery slope" is taken very seriously

3. I want to recognize that while this may set a precedent, it is also true that DFINITY (as a member of the NNS DAO) may also raise its own internal bar for future cases. In a DAO, all one can do is control their own voting after all.

4. I want to recognize people have good ideas for future cases

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 16:41:03 UTC | #109

I'm going to double down on the fact that it's not necessary to do the proposed solution to recover taggr accounts and you can do this with a couple line low impact code change to the Internet Identity frontend that would not impact the user experience.

[quote="lastmjs, post:102, topic:19112"]
The NNS could be programmed to enforce that a proposal can never be passed by one neuron, regardless of the voting power.
[/quote]

I think its a bit more complex that the simplification that one or two neurons can pass a vote.

1) There are something like 16,000+ neurons that vote when DFINITY votes on proposals that fall under All Topics.  While most neurons were configured to follow neurons 27 or 28 by default when they were created, every neuron owner has chosen not to change their configuration.
2) For governance motion proposals, which doesn't change code, every neuron owner that votes has made an intentional choice for who they follow.  None were set by default.  They have voted by selecting their proxy.
3) If you take Synapse as an example, our vote is triggered by simple majority of 12 Followees.  One vote does trigger liquid democracy, but only after 6 others have voted to adopt or 5 others have voted to reject.  That act only triggers 21 votes owned by the Synapse neuron.  All other votes come from people who have chosen Synapse as their proxy.
4) It is entirely possible that one of our voting member neurons is configured to follow multiple other neurons outside Synapse (that's not supposed to happen, but only neuron owners can control who they follow), which could on occasion include the triggering neuron that cascades liquid democracy that passes through the Synapse neuron.
5) I'm pretty sure that DFINITY neurons are controlled by multiple Followee neurons as well, each of which are controlled by different people.  I don't know who or how many, but that's my understanding how they control their neuron voting.

I just think it's much more nuanced than the notion that only one or two entities control the NNS.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-29 06:48:44 UTC | #112

This is the exact point we’ve uncovered…

There are protocol level changes required to make sure that a continuously improving and upgradable decentralized application can be built on the IC.

Currently, the only way to ensure this doesn’t happen again is to risk decentralization.

If Taggr was not truly decentralized this problem would’ve been fixed in 30 seconds.

We have of course identified a number of process improvements that should/would make it harder to happen but in my view it’s an inevitability that it will.

So are you in general opposed to the NNS DAO supporting other DAOs built on the ICP?

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-29 07:29:31 UTC | #113

@diegop Having emotional reassurances from DFINITY is a good start but not enough. A formal declaration from not only DFINITY but the NNS would be necessary in this case. I'd like to re-emphasize my statement:

[quote="benji, post:89, topic:19112"]
* The NNS should first pass a governance proposal, declaring that it would never assign itself as a controller of another canister, unless a) there is a security incident, b) the last owner prior to the security incident provably submits a proposal asking the NNS for help, and c) the community agrees via NNS voting.
* The proposal from Taggr should clearly state its purpose: it wants to fork the IC network after a security incident, and not disguise it as “social recovery”. The NNS would be voting on whether to adopt the new fork as mainnet.
* After the incident is resolved, the NNS shall immediately revoke its power to add itself as a controller to other canisters by performing a code upgrade (if applicable).
[/quote]

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-29 07:48:06 UTC | #114

Achieving full decentralization and censorship resistance of the World Computer would require the NNS to limit its scope in a clearly defined way, otherwise it would degenerate into a "mob rule" as Jordan described above. 

Granted it is technically impossible for the NNS to enforce such declarations in the future, nor would it be binding for all current and future members of the NNS, however such a formal declaration from the NNS would serve as a much stronger social consensus than whatever promises we're getting in the forum.

There's still a long way to go but this could very well be the crucial first step.

christian | 2023-03-29 08:10:04 UTC | #115

> however such a formal declaration from the NNS would serve as a much stronger social consensus than whatever promises we’re getting in the forum.

Btw, this was already discussed during the ethos proposal. As far as I remember, the only conclusion was that a rigid set of rules is simply not enforceable when any individual voter can make a personal exception on any proposal they like, which is obvious.

I bet that after a DeFi hack, if there is a proposal reverting this hack, everyone _affected_ will say this is worth being an exception no matter what they preached before.

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-29 08:16:22 UTC | #116

Yes I'm aware of the ethos proposal. We're exploring at the forefront of DAO governance and it's probably time to bring that discussion back. It's great that you mentioned it, and I think a possible solution is to structure it as follows:

Establish a different class of proposals (the "Constitution") that would require a much larger quorum and threshold (for example 80% required to pass), and other governance proposals cannot be passed in violation of the Constitution. Proposals in this class would thus be subject to much more scrutiny and less prone to manipulation by interest groups. This would make it enforceable against all normal governance proposals.

waco | 2023-03-29 08:45:14 UTC | #117

My comment was flagged for stating the truth? 

The NNS was not designed to alter the Internet Computer's code to rescue a DApp with only a handful of users and no TVL, simply because the developer made an easily avoidable mistake.

If this were a DApp unrelated to Dfinity, we wouldn't even be discussing this issue. You are merely demonstrating the centralized nature of the Internet Computer.

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-29 08:52:23 UTC | #118

waco | 2023-03-29 08:56:28 UTC | #119

Indeed, the topic is relevant. As far as I'm aware, the founder of Taggr is either employed by or connected to Dfinity. Furthermore, numerous Taggr users are employed at Dfinity.

The fact that the comment was flagged actually supports this point.

Proposal 115067 on the IC now has so many people voting in favor. This is the rhythm of death. If this proposal is passed, everyone can sleep and sleep. There is no hope.

If this is passed, it means that the IC is completely reduced to a fake chain, which means that the underlying foundation of the blockchain does not exist directly, and it is completely reduced to a situation that is more depraved than the occupied area;

This is the most terrifying governance attack, a hacker attack under the guise of a name;

It’s really not a joke, this is not a child’s play, the ground shakes when the foundation of the bottom layer moves;

The foundation of the bottom layer is unstable, and the applications on it are all bubbles, and many people do not realize the seriousness of the problem at all;

This is actually a naked governance attack, directly attacking the underlying logic;

All applications and investors built on shaky foundations are all buried with them;

Those who voted in favor are simply idiots who don’t understand the deep meaning of the blockchain. It’s a pity that most investors are such idiots, just chasing profit maximization and fake benevolence;

I can only hope for the negative votes of the foundation. If the foundation also recognizes the imbecile, then there is really no way to save it. Damn it, I invested so much money to play with these idiots, hey;

Grass fucking eight year pledge.

-------------------------

dicita | 2023-03-29 10:23:18 UTC | #127

The most compelling and logical solution is to allow Taggr to reset the dApp, with minimal losses, and promptly commence the strategic planning of a robust and effective policy for the NNS.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-29 10:29:31 UTC | #128

I appreciate and respect your views... always have!

However, my penultimate point is that by design the NNS DAO can do this.  It's already voted to launch and control a SNS for an application.

I completely get what you want the NNS to be... but it is not that today.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-29 10:35:23 UTC | #129

Btw, this exact process step has been implemented and will be required for voting in the future but let's be real this is not realistic for a multi-million user uber decentralized app that wants to remain competitive with continuous updates.

It also doesn't mean the code is right and could mean that the ability to push proposals breaks and we're right back here.

-------------------------

northman | 2023-03-29 10:52:48 UTC | #130

Here are some of the things that consumers may want to consider when determining their confidence in an Dapp.  I added identity decoupling and awareness that the NNS could potentially change the state and code of a canister.

  
![trust|690x388](upload://6aWuzLVLcyvLUHaLjJcdwPY7SQs.png)



Enterprises will want to have confidence that their Dapps and Data are safe from unpredictability.  While using the NNS may resolve the Taggr situation, it generates uncertainty and may undermine confidence in placing enterprise class services on chain in the future.  This needs to be better framed if the ICP is going to be positioned as ready for prime time and a challenger to web2.

-------------------------

timo | 2023-03-29 10:53:56 UTC | #131

Can we get more information on the alternatives before voting on this proposal? Did I understand correctly from this thread that Taggr a) has a backup and b) the only obstacle to re-launch in a different canister is the principal-mapping of II?

Then it can really be fixed with a one-off fix in the II. So it would be an application-level change to help another application. Moreover, the change would be in an application (II) which is already controlled by NNS and for which the NNS has a clear mandate to control it. Whereas whether the NNS has the mandate to overwrite a canister binary is controversial, judging by this thread. 

Moreover, I would like to point out that this is not urgent. Taggr will survive if this takes a few days or even weeks. Maybe Taggr will attract even more users after the fix the longer this story is being discussed. I see no urgency to rush through a controversial proposal.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-03-29 11:10:13 UTC | #132

Anvil named neuron is voting 'yes'. In our opinion, the IC ecosystem is still in experimental stage. Things break and will need to be fixed. I doubt changing Internet Identity is going to be a better solution - messing with user credentials instead of canister upgrades - doesn't sound very good or a less powerful intervention.

Long term, @skilesare Social Recovery DAO sounds good.
I would like to have easy to use a rollback feature at a protocol level where the controller can roll back to an older version and its previous memory with one proposal. This will also solve issues when something wipes canister memory.

Similar to the UX: When you change your screen resolution you have to click "confirm" or the new resolution gets rolled back in 20 seconds. 

This way the DAO users can experience the upgrade and see if they like it or not.
It will allow users to review the changes, instead of asking them to review the code.
For SNS that will be a good fit, since the ledger is not part of what the SNS DAO controls.

-------------------------

dicita | 2023-03-29 11:14:24 UTC | #133

This could potentially result in inequity for numerous dApps that have experienced issues in the past and may confront similar problems in the future. Furthermore, it bears the possibility of being exploited for nefarious purposes.

A recovery via option 1 will break all existing II logins or it would require a *permanent* Taggr specific fix inside the II canister which will be maintained by the DFINITY team forever.
[/quote]

Yes, it would be a Taggr specific fix but that doesn't have to be a problem. It can be a Taggr specific fix for now but it can later be migrated into a more general feature of II that allows a form of "redirection". I share the opinion, expressed earlier in the thread, by @lastmjs that the importance of immutable canisters will rise and that we will see upgrades happen by forking to a new canister id rather than overwriting the binary of the old canister id. Such things would require a notion of mapping or re-direction in II if II users are to be able to follow the upgrade.

The fix can also be made opt-in by the user so that old Taggr users need to check a box in the II frontend to opt-in to a redirection and new users of Taggr don't have to know about this. The redirection list can even be further decentralized so that it doesn't have to be maintained inside the II itself.

In summary, I think there is a migration path for this one-off fix to become something useful.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-29 12:01:34 UTC | #135

Are DR canisters an option to future ways of canister management? 

The idea is: 
* OG Canisters is considered Production, DR Canisters are the Recovery canisters
* DR canisters can choose to identify as an OG Canister 
* OG Canisters will have to approve the addition of DR canisters 
* IIs can be configured to identify DR canisters as OG canister hence allow use of same principal across canisters

This allows for: 
* Portability of User data 
* Better Release process (Release on OG canister, make DR canister the main meantime and test) 
* Better up time 

I'm sure the above has a lot of holes, but intent isn't to solutionize but to give an idea of a rough concept

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 12:02:41 UTC | #136

I don't think the redirect option needs to be in the II.  Taggr just needs 2 buttons: signup and signin.  Signin takes them to the old derivation origin and signup takes them to the new derivation origin.  A frontend change is needed to the II, but no canister change.  The frontend change won't be evident to the user.


Or a migrate button and old accounts can migrate to their new principal.  I believe taggr already has the change principal option.


Many solutions here that don't require any significant changes.

Signin takes them to the old derivation origin
[/quote]

That would not work, though, since II expects the "old" canister to signal confirmation. But in this case the "old" canister is dead.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 12:13:17 UTC | #138

Agreed, so the old canister is queried by internet Identity frontend which returns a list of ii-alternative-origins.  Well it's dead, so instead of querying it, the ii-alternative-origins for that specific canister is hardcoded into the ii frontend.  
Wouldnt that work? @bjoern

-------------------------

bjoern | 2023-03-29 12:14:20 UTC | #139

Yes, if we encode a Taggr-specific rule in II that states "if derivation canister id = old Taggr canister id AND requesting canister = new Taggr canister then accept", that would work.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 12:15:37 UTC | #140

Just one more thing, I don't believe this would require a backend canister change and only a frontend change to the javascript, is this correct?

-------------------------

bjoern | 2023-03-29 12:18:22 UTC | #141

The change is in JS only, that is correct. As the JS is included in the Wasm module and thus upgraded via the same process, it doesn't make too much of a difference, though.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 12:26:31 UTC | #142

Thank you, imo there is a perception of changing the frontend relative to the backend where one is changing the smart contract and one is changing the human interface.  Just my observation though.

Also maintenance wise, it should be far cheaper to maintain a frontend js change.

I'm genuinely confused by the push back this proposal is receiving.

It's not that I disagree with the pushback. But let's be honest, @mechaquan isn't wrong in his observation that this well within the norm for this network. I've seen several people refer to this as our "The DAO" moment, but I can't help feeling like we've already experienced several of those moments. IIRC NNS node providers have their own proposal system by which they can push canister upgrades without stakeholder consent. Is that cability restricted in any way or are we putting trust in the NPs not to collude and act maliciously? DFINITY directs an overwhelming amount of liquid VP on non-governance topics. With this much influence they could literally change any aspect of the protocol that they wanted. Motion proposals are nice; but they are basically a courtesy to stakeholders and nothing more. Is everyone pushing back going to start pushing for a follower reset on all topics?

I hope everyone reading this understands that I'm not trying to FUD; I just want to understand why this proposal? Is it because it's such an obvious departure from the crypto ethos that we feel compelled to speak out? Would we care as much if DF had decided to just take it upon themselves to push the replica upgrade without submitting a motion proposal? Maybe, but how quickly would we have just written it of as "this is how governance works; they are largest stakeholder; deal with it or leave".

Can we really have a "The DAO" moment if we never really had any guarantees of immutability to begin with? We all trust DFINITY. That is the reality. I'm glad they gave us the courtesy of posting a motion proposal. We can all vote to reject and they would probably honor that decision, but that doesn't mean they've lost their ability to push this change in the future.

If we do reject this proposal I hope we continue the trend and push for follow-on changes that would actually prevent this from happening in a worst case scenario where DF is forced to make this change regardless of stakeholder consent. Otherwise, we haven't really achieved anything other than preventing TAGGR from recovering their canister.

I apologize ahead of time to whomever I may have upset with this post.

Just cause it is possible it shouldn't be justified, technically all chains are mutable if a majority of hashrate/VP decides to reorg/fork, that doesn't mean such things are taken lightly in the crypto space and I think we should take a page from their book.

The closest thing I can think of is the Mario64 event, which while sharing some similarities, i.e the debate about what the NNS should be capable of, isn't comparable as the canister owner removed it by his own will and hosting illegal content on chain is a much more complex topic cause it involves technical problems that are hard to overcome due to how the protocol is designed, still it was a heavily topic and after that Dfinity chose to move forward with BN for censoring content so I assume and hope deleting canister will be a rare occurence in the future and only be done in extreme cases, e.g vulnerabilities, CP, etc.. after careful considerations. 
If there are other similar situations I'm missing let me know.

I'm not aware of any NP specific proposal system, it is true that if they collude they could run any binary version they like though, but from my understanding it would be a breach of the "declaration of good intent" whatever that means legally and could be technically seen as a violation of Dfinity's source code license, so they might be sued by Dfiinty on that basis.

Because we have to start somewhere, there are alternatives but for whatever reason the higher ups have decided to go with the one that is less in line with the crypto ethos and that could further worsen IC public image and possibly scare away existing and potential new projects from considering the chain.

Many community members have been pushing for it for months but have largely been ignored, @wpb ,@justmythoughts and myself even made a proposal back in August to have fundamental NNS features prioritized, Dfinity decided to ignore it, vote against it and focus on the compounding feature instead, a must have feature for any DAO /s, if you look at the voting outcome and take away Dfinity's VP the proposal should have passed: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/72189 so it is clear what the community wanted.
I'm not sure what we can do which hasn't been done on this front, Wenzel is working hard to make replica upgrades more decentralized but it will take some time, for now Dfinity pretty much controls the NNS and if they decided to ignore feedback there isn't much we can do other than point it out.

Many builders have also been pushing for better DX for canister upgrades, unfortunately it seems we have a bad habit that causes many pressing issues to be ignored until shit hits the fan.

I don't think any reasonable person wants to prevent TAGGR from recovering their canister, but we should consider all alternatives before opening Pandora's box, there might and most likely are better solutions that don't violate crypto principles and at the same time will help making the IC infrastructure more robust.
Personally I would have preferred if the thread started with the intent of brainstorming what those solutions might be and eventually agree on one.

These are just my 2 cents.

As a known neuron (13765488517578645474), I feel it's important that I give at least a 24hr heads up that I will be voting "yes" on this proposal, and to provide a public explanation of my guiding principles on this forum.

First off, I agree with Dom's vision here and support him in this:

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:5, topic:19112"]
As ICP and the world computer paradigm scales, I think we are going to eventually see a hierarchy of DAOs, with communities of projects assigning themselves domain-specific DAOs.
[/quote]

At the end of the day, power/control is never destroyed, it's only transferred. The innovation of decentralization is that it's transferred to multiple parties instead of a few elites. Dom's vision of the IC brings this power into the hands of neurons, whereas in other chains it's in the hands of the core devs and node providers. The historic DAO hack in ETH's early days is an example that this type of power the NNS has exists even in other chains.

Arguing whether the NNS should or should not have a specific level of power/control is a separate topic, personally I think the most important thing is defining a way for us to collectively use it's power wisely.

[quote="benji, post:116, topic:19112"]
Yes I’m aware of the ethos proposal. We’re exploring at the forefront of DAO governance and it’s probably time to bring that discussion back.
[/quote]

I came up with the Ethos proposal to empower Dom's vision. Not to tame the NNS or reduce it's power, but to align and define the collective good intentions of the neurons so as to encourage the community not to be fearful of the great power the NNS ultimately does (and in my opinion should) possess.

The NNS voted that it wasn't ready to start the process of defining any principals and I respect that. The community sentiment was that Known Neurons should define principles for themselves, so here's mine:

**The NNS may be used as an administrator of last resort to resolve accidental, unforeseen, and catastrophic technical issues which effect a large number of innocent network users.**

Someday companies like Visa will want to build on the IC, and they won't ever agree to do so if the only way to recover from a glitch that effects billions of dollars would be to fork the entire blockchain. This type of power being in the hands of token holders is what makes the IC a more pragmatic decentralized network than ETH.

I love your entire post, especially this part.  I fully agree we should be thinking about policies and decisions that make ICP a sensible choice for mainstream adoption and enterprise solutions.

I agree with these thoughts. Why are we moving forward with a controversial change to a canister's binary when we can accomplish the same thing with a change to II which is already under the control of the NNS? And that change only has to be to the frontend based on conversations above.

First of all congratulations to the Taggr team on the progress thus far. 

I emphasize with your loss and the unfortunate nature of events. 

However, look at this analogy: if you are in a relationship and you cheat, you don’t come back and be like ohh it was a one time thing and would never happen again…because it most likely will happen again. whether your significant other believes and forgives you does not change the fact that you are a cheater. 

Back to the topic of discussion; what needs to be considered by the NNS in relation to Taggr is if there was financial damage. And if there is financial damage then what steps are there to help them get back in their feet. 

If there was a mistake on the code level; that is a HARD LEARNING LESSON for future developers to be aware of. 

Unlike Dom I am all about chasing perfection and I absolutely do not reward bad practices and mistakes. 
That said, It is either we are talking about financially being of service to Taggr or helping them get back to their feet without involvement of the NNS.

I think so, yes. I want the NNS to get out of the application layer. It should only be used to change the code of the protocol and perhaps some other parameters.

[/quote]

@diegop, I have to challenge this a bit :slight_smile:. I think us opposing this action have well grounded concerns about what this means regarding the NNS's power both today and following a successful "yes" vote of this proposal. 

The NNS is unrivaled in both its decision-making capabilities and ability to execute on those decisions - it can move fast, scary fast. And, unlike traditional blockchains, there is no risk of a fork from the opposition; we're effectively trapped here. For reacting to system-breaking issues, this makes sense - you need to deploy fixes fast. Similarly, we all benefit from being able to ship improvements quickly. However, I think it's fair to raise alarm towards directing this power up into the app layer. Especially, without any real assurance about how this power will be used in the future.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 16:17:58 UTC | #154

I believe that TAGGR accounts can be fully recovered by the account holders through the II with 0 code changes to the II or NNS also.

Edit: I would like to note the 0 code change option is pretty tricky and requires the chrome browser.

Thanks Zane!  Agree with a lot of your comments and appreciate your feedback.

For what it's worth, we did discuss many different options and they all have their challenges and in any case would require Dfinity to make a change and this seemed to be the easiest? or preferred? option.

I would have to defer to them on the exact specifics why but bottomline due to the current infrastructure of II and limitations on recovery here we are.

Finally, to me this proposal is really about social recovery (do you believe this is the Taggr canister as evidenced by the DNS TXT records) and as a motion proposal which is not a specific technical proposal I would see it as an approval to investigate the best approach and then Dfinity would have to bring that change forward with then necessary transparency and then of course a big lessons learned debrief.

On the other hand, having this kind of power would mean that an application can never have a TVL on the IC that is worth more than the marketcap of ICP itself, without breaking the security model. Is that what we really want?

Morning Campers, 
So I have been following this, as we all have, and wanted to throw a few peanuts from the gallery. 

Personally, the NNS discussion, though intentionally broad and deep in each instance tends to simplify a complicated set of parameters, as if in similar fashion I might say "without water there would be no life", though true and hard to argue against, it leaves out some major parts, like amosphere, and distance from the sun, and its rotion and tilt, and, and, and.  Or even less complicated "Water is wet"  ... hard to argue 

So I think there is still debate to be had, BUT there is a good soldier (Taggr) currently bleeding on the field ... so what to do. 

I like the temporary and/or workaround options the best.
@kpeacock idea of adding the controller saving the patient and then removing the controller would streaght forward and I would think the safest would be to have that in one proposal ... ie. added for 24 hours then remove Yes/No

@rckprtr idea is awesome and has long term uses after the bandaid, especially if control for the enablement of the "if-else" that @bjoern mentioned and authentication for it could be verified through interfaces on the canister's involved it could be a sweet feature. Also long term could play into cool potential blue/green deployments and A/B testing scenarios.

Which I think in combination with maybe a proposal to restore the state data to another canister as a 1 time proposal, could be awesome.

That restored canister would have a new canisterID which would break things, but the taggr team could deploy a new WASM to it and get their data out and migrated to the new canister. 

To give a Tolkien anology the NNS in itself is not evil, nor "the ring to rule them all" ... 

Let's save the soldier, our collective interests in the longevity of the Internet Computer, and get back to our task.

If you want to run a DAO, or not, there needs to be common, secure and available restoration paths that could also be in control of a DAO, or not, and triggered by a vote, or not ...  its 2023 data and applications should never be "lost". But like a few things, that remains to be seen in this ecosystem ... though I will say as we get closer everyday ... 

let's just all agree, having this be the response for DAYS, as the endpoint for Taggr is not good, for any of us ... lets make something happen:
https://taggr.link/

Is this different on ethereum though? Let’s say token T has a mcap A, while all ethereum B < A. So buy 51% of B, fork the chain, sell all T for A => profit! So A has to be even only slightly larger than B/2?  Do I have a bug somewhere?

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2023-03-29 17:51:29 UTC | #162

After considering the discussion here, I think I'd revise my (explicitly personal, not speaking for Dfinity) stance. Removing the mechanism to recover Taggr is the best response if the vote passes. 

However, I've personally voted against the proposal now. I'd prefer if we resolved the login challenges for Taggr users like @rckprtr and @timo have suggested, and had Taggr migrate to a new canister. 

I'd be happy to donate ICP to get the service off the ground again from a backup, but it's a better precedent for the NNS to say that apps can go under due to mistakes, rather than to signal that the NNS is willing to intervene in canister "sovereignty", as it were

This is a great idea.

I think that for any service in which users have long-term accounts, as is typically the case in social networks including taggr, it is good practice to separate the user account from the principal that is used to log in. That is, to not unchangeably identify the two but instead to allow the map from user account to principal to be updated. A principal is a keypair and a such has its own security domain. But the value of the account to the user may change over time. An account may start out as low-value throw-away account for the user, who just wants to try out the service once and consequently uses a weakly protected principal. As the user uses the service more and more that value of the account may increase and at some point the user may want to switch to a principal from a different security domain. I would argue that all social networks, dscvr, taggr, etc. eventually want that feature. 

So here taggr could implement that feature now, deploy a new canister and let users keep their account but migrate from an old principal to a new principal. To do that the users need to be able to use their old principal once with the new taggr canister. I think what @rckprtr is suggesting is that that can be achieved by Chrome (maybe with a special custom setting or an extension that is used exactly once?).

So the work involved would for taggr to implement a feature which they eventually want anyway, which benefits the service regardless of whether it is needed for recovery or not. And the users would to have to go through a recovery step once on a certain browser. Both seem acceptable to me. And no change to II or to the replica s needed. Sounds like an elegant solution.

To be clear: I do not want to stop the discussion about social recovery and the role of the NNS in it. Quite the opposite. That discussion is extremely valuable and should have started yesterday instead of now. I just think that the discussion should not be rushed and I would prefer to see taggr helped _today_ in a different way than by social recovery. But in the future, when social recovery methods are established, the situation is different and I would prefer to see those recovery methods used to help any service that is in a similar situation as taggr is today.

The title is:  Proposal for a social recovery of the TAGGR DAO

Let’s decide if Dapps are worth saving on the ICP…there’s no technical implementation or code attached.  Yes, there was a proposed solution based on many discussions…but it is a motion proposal related to the social recovery of Taggr DAO.

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-29 18:30:04 UTC | #166

@rckprtr  could you please provide the technical details? Do I understand correctly that there’s a way for users to prove the principal from the old canister?

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 18:35:05 UTC | #167

Chrome extension that listens to outbound requests for the ii-alternative-origin that blocks and rewrites the response to whatever taggr has set here:
https://github.com/TaggrNetwork/taggr/blob/919c10bb796800d21938da759e6915ee5613020a/src/backend/assets.rs#L70

Example of the endpoint that the II Frontend queries:
https://<canister-id>.icp0.io/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins

I do think this is good a solution, but if it were for DSCVR I don't think our users would be able to do this and would push for a change to the II frontend project.  Taggr users are different though and are generally more tech savvy.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 18:54:38 UTC | #168

Well the Internet Identity `derivationOrigin` can be anything, it doesn't need to be an active canister.  It takes the URL its provided and does a `HTTP Get Request` to the path `<supplied_url>/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins`

So when you deploy TAGGR now and try to login, the `derivationOrigin` will fail because the canister can not be found.  So you can use a chrome extension to listen to outbound requests to that specific path, block it, and rewrite it with a custom response.  


```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  interceptRequest,
  {urls: ["https://example.com/*"]},
  ["blocking", "responseHeaders"]
);
```

```
function interceptRequest(details) {
  // Modify the response object as needed
  var newResponse = {body: "This is the modified response."};
  return {responseBody: JSON.stringify(newResponse)};
}
```

When TAGGR is deployed, they could provide a migration button (banner at the top?) where users click it, are asked to install a chrome extension (or build and install their own through a public github) and then go through the normal Internet Identity login process.  When users login they can migrate their principal to a new account or keep using the chrome extension.  


My assumption this extension can be done in other browsers, but Im not an expert.

This is wrong below:
Whats also interesting is it does not need to be a canister, it can be any valid URL that has an endpoint `/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins`

I believe this is the correct source:
https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/7c3400ebf367a75123a123e6c41c4f7dab596a62/src/frontend/src/flows/authorize/validateDerivationOrigin.ts#L71

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-29 19:01:42 UTC | #169

Thank you so much, I think I understand. However I’m unable to estimate the feasibility as I never implemented browser extensions and just don’t know  if an extension can intercept and change arbitrary requests or do we also need to patch the browser for that?

We will discuss this in the war room. But this  definitely can’t be the official response to apps restarting from backups… 😁

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-29 19:06:40 UTC | #170

The extension API doesn't allow changing the request but you can block or redirect it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onBeforeRequest
But that just means running a local server that will serve the response instead of just returning it directly, it should be feasible.

If we do this, will the extension be forever required for II anchors to work with the new canister ID?

Thanks for the idea @rckprtr!

I don’t disagree @Hazel . I did not mean to imply that raising concerns (or discussing) is wrong. That was not my intent. I’m not actively working on this within Dfinity, so just wanted to share a sentiment not explicitly written

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 19:11:10 UTC | #172

I mean, if you restart off a backup with a NEW canister_id then this would be a way.  Restarting off a backup with the same canister will always be fine since we have done it a hundred times.  I could see a long term fix being something within Internet Identity to migrate Identities, but my mind is not ready to go that far yet.

@NathanosDev TAGGR is a special case as they already have a change principal (at least I thought it did).  Most apps like DSCVR can't do this because all NFTs stored under the old principal would be lost

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-29 19:13:11 UTC | #173

Well not forever, as you can force the user to re-authenticate against the new canister and replace the principal. Or just use a completely different login method like the seed phrase login we had on taggr.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-29 19:17:03 UTC | #174

>re-authenticate against the new canister and replace the principal

If I understand correctly then this is a change that needs to happen on Taggr's side?

Log the user in with browser extension to validate that they own the original principal and then log the user in again to get their new principal and replace the old one with the new?

Overall it sounds relatively low effort to me.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 19:20:34 UTC | #175

Deploy taggr and the first to login and post gets a reward.

Edit:. Under an old account

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-29 19:38:11 UTC | #176

I also want to put out there that if there's any concerns with using a plugin for a Chromium browser, that this could also be done with a local proxy that runs outside of the browser. This would then work for all browsers and would be independent of the manufacturer.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 19:47:11 UTC | #177

Optionality is always a difficult decision.  Usually can be a good thing.  Clear solution is always preferred.

-------------------------

timo | 2023-03-29 19:56:35 UTC | #178

It could also be done with a hidden, hard-to-access feature in the II frontend that lets the user edit the origin in a way that would normally be unsafe. Then taggr users can use this hidden feature once to migrate their principal to the new principal and then never have to use that hidden feature again. The hidden feature would also not be taggr specific.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-03-29 22:30:39 UTC | #179

This is a great idea and something to consider. However, this raises the issue of NNS mutability, which is investors' primary concern with the IC. Deploying this proposal without market research and sufficient background work would bespeak the immaturity of the IC community's governance processes. Before this progresses, 2 things need to happen:

1. The users and developers of Taggr must survey at least 100 crypto investors to understand how this will affect their view on the investability of ICP, SNS token projects, and other projects building on the IC. Other concerns should be solicited from investors as well. This feedback must be used to inform the proposal design. This is a bare minimum. It is not much to ask that a project justify the involvement of the NNS by doing a little bit of work.

2. A detailed explanation of why Taggr should be rescued rather than just re-deployed needs to be included in the proposal. As does an initial list of extenuating circumstances that separate the case of Taggr from other prospective cases we might imagine encountering going forward. This is so there is a precedent projects can refer to when a prospective investor raises the question of arbitrary interference of the NNS.

Not taking these steps will negatively impact the ICP token and all other tokens hosted on the IC.

This has been an amazing series of posts today.  I'm so impressed with how civilized and intellectually honest it has been and how many talented and deep thinkers have contributed to the discussion.

I doubt this has been lost on many people, but I just wanted to take the time to say thank you especially to Rick Porter (@rckprtr).  I mean, he's a founder of another major social media app ([DSCVR](https://dscvr.one)) that is building on the ICP, which means he's really in competition with [Taggr Network](https://taggr.top/).  Yet he's been making major contributions to the deliberation including offering technical solutions based on his own experience.  I think it's so impressive how much the IC community is willing to ideate and learn together and I really appreciate seeing Rick's advice on how to solve this problem.

rckprtr | 2023-03-30 00:11:19 UTC | #186

No problem, and thank you for the shout out.  We should always rally when one of us goes down.  There is going to be a lot of challenges to face in the future and happy to share the learnings we have had.  Can't wait to see taggr back up and running.

The mutability is something that drew me to the IC. As they say, adapt and evolve or die. To me, it’s amazing how the IC can continually upgrade itself, and continually correct from previous mistakes. 

That doesn’t mean I dont think that mutability has risks - of course it does. But mutability and on chain governance have always been part of the DNA of the IC. I presume investors that value strict immutability above everything else would not have invested in the IC or any system with on-chain governance. 

I do appreciate the argument that using the NNS for application recovery opens a can of worms. But I don’t think that can of worms is so deadly if we safeguard against the slippery slope.

Taggr took a risk by being early to build on the IC, and are part of the pioneering set of dApps that are helping us work out the kinks in our system. I do feel it would be terribly unkind and unnecessary to turn our backs on them when they are trailblazing the path, especially given what they’ve given to our ecosystem. We are still very small and have the ability to put our heads together to help - I don’t think we gain anything major by abiding by strict philosophical codes. Remember we are still fighting just to be relevant.

I’m a little confused as to why the Foundation cannot offer support to a dApp that is asking for help. It’s not unwanted interference. Ultimately it won’t be the Foundation that decides on this it’ll be the NNS, and is it not a good thing that the NNS can occasionally choose to help those in need?

If the NNS was stepping in and screwing with a dApp against its will, well that would be an entirely different story. That would be a story of a tyranny of the majority, and understandably @lastmjs wants to change our governance system to safeguard against this mob rule. That makes sense. But this case with Taggr is not that.

It smells a lot like incompetence more than anything else specially for outsiders ! Obviously users will defend Tagger but calling this "social recovery" based on the fact that they were first will be very bad in the long run for IC.

All real businesses I know value resilience of tech systems enough to pay for multiple data centers and additional capacity in the off-chance its needed 

I hope this is a big enough warning to take such an offering seriously for ICP 

It would make ICP the ideal place for corporates to settle (given NNS platform risk is curbed) and allow us to market true app level resiliency in any Business Development conversations

To be clear, Taggr does not consider ourselves as victims.  Yes, we made a mistake and we wholly accept that.  However, no money was lost and the $TAGGR tokens weren't even tradable yet.

This whole project has been an experiment for us and a lot of fun for everyone.  Yes we were aggressively sailing in the uncharted waters of decentralization and ran aground!  As a result, we identified a number of potential issues and wanted to raise this for the betterment of the IC and other DAOs wishing to pursue decentralization!  Be careful out there!

We did not "cry", we apologized and sought to resolve in a decentralized way utilizing this incredible new technology and tool that we have at our disposal, the NNS.  And look what has come out of it already!  Some great lessons learned and suggestions for improvements to the ICP, and internally for us too!

So in summary, the primary objective is to raise awareness and ask for the NNS DAO to help and potentially create new ways of working in a decentralized world.  We have not lost data, our code, or our resolve!

Either way, and regardless of the outcome of this vote, we will continue to explore the uncharted waters and share our adventures with the community!

The more i read from this guy ..the more i shake my head.

Start of the post , people here were quite supportive as no alternative was suggested and taggr was one of the early dapp. But now , rick has suggested an alternative (a very good one that doesn't involve NNS) so now the whole situation doesn't seems "dead end". Many developers in ICP that I respect have already raised their concerns that changes involving NNS is a bad idea and we should all take this seriously.

I honestly don't see how this is the case at all, the context is not ETH staking and there's no burning incentive for mining blocks. Also, TVL and Market Cap are both relative to liquidity. If enough ICP is decentralized and locked, then there's not enough liquidity for anything built on it to have significant impact on governance.

I’d like to flag to the community that Synapse voted no. The vote was split right down the middle. I voted in favor which should be clear from my posts, so I was on the losing side. 

To all those who think that Synapse is controlled by Dfinity, think again! It is an eclectic group of people with independent thoughts who vote with their own convictions.

Yup that's a good point. If enough ICP is already locked then the attacker would not be able to gain enough VP.

[quote="aiv, post:148, topic:19112"]
The NNS may be used as an administrator of last resort to resolve accidental, unforeseen, and catastrophic technical issues which effect a large number of innocent network users.
[/quote]

I agree with your statement, if we clearly define:
1. What constitutes "last resort"? In this Taggr case, if it could be fixed via an II hack, does it still count as last resort?
2. "Technical issues". How to we limit the scope to only technical issues in the future, and how do we enforce that?
3. "A large number of users". Does the Taggr case really concern a large number of users? How many users would qualify? And how to you weigh in the value? For example, someone decides to store a billion dollars on the IC, and it's lost due to a technical issue. That's one user but a huge amount of value. Would that be enough to qualify?

My entire point is not against performing a Taggr rescue, but if we were to do it we would need to clearly define these things for the benefit of the long term.

There are other update patterns that TAGGR needs to consider.  

**Ignore `post_upgrade`**: This allows you to not go over the instruction limit for a canister upgrade.  To do this you do a canister upgrade with `post_upgrade` and `pre_upgrade` commented out, which runs the `pre_upgrade` from the previous canisters version but ignores the `post_upgrade` from the new canister using only the instructions required to perform the `pre_upgrade`.  In the next canister upgrade you reimplement `pre_upgrade` and `post_upgrade` which will only run the `post_upgrade` on the new canister version, which saves you instruction count by ignoring `pre_upgrade`.

There are a couple other pitfalls which we have discussed with the DFINITY and over-time we have seen quite a bit of upgrades to the protocol to help us work around these issues, but everyone is working in the unkown and facing these problems together.

So, I estimate there is a high chance that TAGGR will face future upgrade issues and most likely run into an issue that can't be resolved through a fix to the Internet Identity (for example).

Future applications that are developed on the IC will continue to push the boundaries and continue to face new types of issues.  I know this because we at DSCVR find something new every so often and still periodically update from our backups (I think its been awhile though).  We still have control over our canisters and are able to take steps to fully recover our canister.  Apps that choose to give up control of their applications, whether you agree if its decentralized or not, will need ways to recover their canisters.

In a perfect system these issues would not exist, but that seems unlikely and if everything is perfect my assumption innovation has ended and we are no longer pushing the boundaries.  I believe that most IC applications are also using a very small subset of the capabilities of the IC and have not even begun to explore the technology in its fullest.  

Therefore I believe that the idea of having an application like the NNS as a controller and being able to perform actions on your canister could give confidence to developers that in the end their is a way to recover the hard work they have put in to growing an ecosystem around their dapp. This also gives confidence to apps like DSCVR, which has many ecosystem integrations, that a dapp we rely on can be recovered through other mechanisms like the NNS.

On the IC smart contracts (canisters) can be deleted, sometimes accidentally, with no path to recovery.  This makes integrations risky if they are an important part of your applications value prop and teams like DSCVR at times would rather build our own services instead of integrating to mitigate this risk.

Just my thoughts.

The need for a subjective interpretation of a guiding principle is a feature, not a bug.

If literally everything was fully defined then a guiding principle becomes confining, brutal, inflexible to change, and useless for driving good.

Jesus urged people to follow "the spirit of the law" over following the "letter of the law" for these exact reasons. Said another way every decision must involve some interpretation, otherwise it risks being unjust.

The guiding principle must simply define "the spirit of the law" which we can all aim for and align with, and lay a foundation of something we all agree of as good. Once it's defined, we now have a framework for determining the interpretation for how that guiding principle should apply to specific situations. It gives us a direction to look for answers that align with our shared goals, but it will not directly provide the answer for all situations.

To be fair, at the time I wrote my post and placed my vote I wasn't yet aware that there was a viable alternative to using the NNS, you are correct that this should be a valid consideration as people make their decision. Honestly it may have even changed my answer.

21 hours left, and then we can move over to the KYT topic. So far the ID 27 & 28 did not vote, they could end this easily.

Whatever happens at the end of this, It seems to me everyone is aware of the clear risks that's been raised since the start of the whole treasury issue 

It's community fracturing and it mentally and emotionally exhausts builders as well as the enthusiasts 

This loss in confidence also seeps out to the external community 

I don't know the right answer to this problem but rather than let these types of situation repeat and assault morale over and over, perhaps some action is due to manage this all?

To clarify, there are two ways to resolve these issues:

1) Centralized approach which results in a fork and < 100% recovery, or

2) Decentralized approach which results in 100% recovery and requires the NNS to make a change

We were using the proposed solution put forward by Dfinity (see first post on this thread from Dom).  This was not something just dreamed up by Taggr.  

If we had the NNS as a controller in the first place we would still need a social recovery and for the NNS to approve a binary update to the Taggr canister as is the structure for SNS canisters.

We can and will build in more rigor and contingency to prevent this in the future (regardless of vote outcome) but the first and last resort for a decentralized and 100% recovery is always a request/proposal to the NNS... 

However some people seem to be suggesting that we take a centralized recovery approach first.  This could have been started/done in a couple hours after the canister went down but we wanted to take the decentralized 100% blockchain based recovery approach first.

In any case, I wanted to thank everyone for their support and comments... this issue has been an invaluable learning experience!

Hey all, I don't want to get too deeply involved in this debate myself, but.. want to add my perspective, and a proposal. 

In the above thread, I can see a lot of good points, from a lot of good people, many of which have starkly differing views. This is not a new debate in blockchain, and of course, back in the day, I myself was deeply involved in "The DAO" Ethereum debate myself. We are not going to resolve this debate here, and I suspect it will continue to play out over many years. Reaching agreement here will always be challenging because the perspectives involved are partly ideological, and partly practical, and it's difficult to untangle them.

Without getting into the weeds, here's my personal context.

Firstly, the Internet Computer was always meant to be a DAO-governed blockchain. In January 2017, before the public ICO in February 2017, I described what was then termed the "Blockchain Nervous System" in a Medium post titled " The DFINITY “Blockchain Nervous System,” which you can still find here https://medium.com/dfinity/the-dfinity-blockchain-nervous-system-a5dd1783288e (for those interested, much of the thinking partly involved was spurred by The DAO debacle, where for example you can see I was busy suggesting technical ways that DAO voting could be made more secure, etc, see https://dominic-w.medium.com/using-wait-for-quiet-voting-in-the-dao-12ecd9d9ccc3). 

People were promised what was described. Some key quotes include:

> The DFINITY network makes “The Code is Law” ethos contingent upon this distributed intelligence.

Another key quote, discussing lessons drawn from "The DAO" debacle is:

> Firstly, it will take a long time for the developer community to fully internalize many of the additional design challenges involved in the creation of autonomous systems using smart contracts and some important systems will always turn up with flaws. Secondly, the intractability of *potential problems* will prevent an important contingent of the business community building on public compute networks because its senior decision makers will demand there is means to fix critical systems that get hacked or deadlocked. Thirdly, it’s probably not fair to leave mass market consumers without recourse for problems caused by flaws in autonomous smart contract code they cannot even read.

Another key quote, talking about BNS (i.e. NNS) proposals types is:

> When a user opens their neuron client software, it displays the proposals stored by the blockchain resident portion of the BNS. Proposals have types such as “Economics”, “Policy”, “Protocol”, “Client Upgrades”, “Fixup Resident” and “Freeze Resident”.

Another is:

> Active actions involve the BNS reaching outside of its own smart contracts to modify existing artifacts on chain, directly overriding “The Code is Law”. For example, the BNS might have adopted a proposal to freeze a smart contract forbidden by the constitution, such as an assassination market, or wish to run arbitrary code in privileged mode to fix some broken system.

There are many more similar quotes we could draw attention to. What's important is the public who participated in funding the development of the network were told in advance what principles it would pursue, and those are also what the DFINITY Foundation effectively committed to helping develop. Therefore, both those contributing to the technical development of the network, and those building on the network, have always had every reason to believe that the NNS would play the role of fixing systems for the community, as well as efficiently and regularly upgrading and evolving the network, and so on, notwithstanding that every such act must proceed through the algorithmic democracy/distributed intelligence that is the NNS, which is designed to mediate community decisions. 

Since this was what was promised, imo it's difficult to spring a "The Code Is Law" change on the amazing Taggr project and its community, which had every reason to believe they were building on a DAO-governed ecosystem that had the ability to fix fully decentralized ecosystem DAOs that went wrong. Taggr, one of the most innovative, and among the most decentralized social media projects in the world, deserves better. Not fixing it would amount to a kind of bait and switch, and so imo the NNS should help get it up and running asap.

However, there are differing opinions regarding "The Code Is Law," and these opinions are all equally valid, and just come from different perspectives, and therefore we should also aim to better support the heterogeneity of beliefs among our community going forwards, which will reflect well on the strength of the ICP digital democracy and allow the network function as a broad church. This can be done through a proposal to the NNS, which if passed, will see people working the following ICP technical enhancement:

1. Canister smart contracts can be tagged with "THE_CODE_IS_LAW"

2. The network will upload canisters that are so tagged onto special subnets, where the NNS plays no role (with the exception of upgrading the network protocol, adding removing nodes, etc)

This will allow the two visions two coexist, and people building projects can choose what they want. Feels like this is the best way forwards. 

But I do want to draw attention to one caveat that I think is unavoidable. We need to remember that canister smart contracts are far more powerful than traditional smart contracts, and can easily be used to create things like fully on-chain assassination markets, child trafficking exchanges, and other horrible things. As per that original Medium post, ultimately the world will not tolerate such things, and nation states will attack networks that support them.

The NNS ultimately strives to make the Internet Computer/ICP network successful through its decisions, and inviting nation state attacks is unlikely to be concordant with that. Currently, we hope that boundary node filtering will provide a sufficient solution to the issue – and this is the direction we have taken, and hopefully that will work out – but in the event that, say, an terrorist coordination service is running, and for some reason boundary node filtering isn't sufficient, it seems likely that some level of intervention by the NNS would inevitably have to be proposed, for moral reasons, and to ensure those working on the technology do not find themselves inadvertently supporting that. 

So to be clear, the "The Code Is Law" change I'm proposing here will likely always have some limits. That said, we can certainly make it possible for non-violent, non-criminal etc "morally acceptable" canister smart contracts to exist within an environment where that applies, and I think we should. We could also add additional functionality that allows such canisters to firewall those that don't exist in that environment if they wished too. 

Thinking this makes a lot of sense.

This doesn’t address some of the concerns related to NNS and ICP


NNS still has major influence on tokenomics and other major aspects of the network including the NNS front-end. This isn’t permissionless. It makes ICP a permissioned network.


DFINITYs neutrality and voting patterns are questionable. ICP needs more systematic Governance Discussions & Less silly code changes.
