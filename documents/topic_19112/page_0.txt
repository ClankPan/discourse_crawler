Taggr (https://taggr.link/) is one of the most important projects on the Internet Computer. It represents the first fully self-governed social media, which also has sophisticated tokenization systems that create positive incentives, contribute to content ranking etc. It should have the support of everyone who cares about the future of open internet services and Web3 social media.

The service is currently created by a canister smart contract that doesn't have a controller (i.e. where the controller-id is set to null) and it is updated by custom DAO functionality that is hosted within the canister itself.

Over the weekend, the DAO pushed a bad update, and now the canister smart contract is inoperable. Because the canister does not have a human or organization controlling it, and is instead fully controlled by its DAO (as I strongly believe is the future!) it cannot reapply a good update, since the DAO functionality, which is hosted inside the canister, has become inoperable.

We in the broad ICP community need to help the Taggr community get up and running as quickly as possible. Therefore, DFINITY will propose a one-time replica patch that allows the Taggr community to apply a canister code update and get up and running again. This is imminent, please be available to vote on the proposal, which I personally strongly advocate is adopted

Going forwards, the consensus is that open internet services using this architecture assign the NNS DAO to the controller id, so that it can more easily act as a decentralized administrator of last resort if something likes this occurs. 

We also need to add features to ICP to de-risk such upgrades. For example, could canister memory snapshots be created before upgrades to prevent against an upgrade or bug causing corruption (snapshots would seem to be generally useful too)

Taggr uses highly custom tokenization, so simply assigning control to an SNS DAO would be no easy feat, albeit as the SNS platform becomes more sophisticated and configurable over time, this might one day be a solution for them. Taggr also reflects how a heterogeneous DAO ecosystem is the future and should be encouraged

Thanks all

Thank you Dom üôè 

Decentralization is the future but also has its risks and think this more apparent now than ever before!  So, while we definitely have some lessons learned here and will need to proceed in the uncharted waters with more care we will continue to push boundaries of web3!

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2023-03-27 12:56:59 UTC | #3

Thank you for the post and support, Dom! TAGGRDAO appreciates it!

What sort of technical benefit would be gained from the NNS DAO controlling the canister versus the NNS DAO having 'root-level' authority over the whole of the IC?

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2023-03-27 13:02:42 UTC | #4

I was wondering last week why the website suddenly disappeared. Governance should still be available even if the website is not working, so that a faulty update can be undone. Hopefully it will work out

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-03-27 13:04:48 UTC | #5

This is a learning exercise for everyone in the community, but generally, the proposed solution is another example of the power of having a master DAO (i.e. the NNS) controlling the Internet Computer network. As ICP and the world computer paradigm scales, I think we are going to eventually see a hierarchy of DAOs, with communities of projects assigning themselves domain-specific DAOs.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2023-03-27 13:08:37 UTC | #6

Thank you for opening the discussion for Taggr. It is for sure an interesting case as we are pioneering and pushing the boundaries of what a DAO can do. Challenges like this and probably many others will come our way.

-------------------------

AndyBrier01 | 2023-03-27 13:10:19 UTC | #7

Thank you for being so responsive and quick off the mark here.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-27 13:11:50 UTC | #8

I fully support this! Its an interesting dev case study as well. I hadnt thought about canister snapshots.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-03-27 13:18:45 UTC | #9

That's a good question. In principle, any smart contract can be updated on any chain using a replica/client software fork that the hosting network's community agrees upon, as per Ethereum fork after "The DAO" got hacked in 2016. The ICP community also wields the same power, but it is mediated via the NNS DAO that controls and updates the network, through which it exercises control in a more transparent, decentralized and algorithmic way. But in essence, it's the same thing. 

What is clear with respect to blockchains, is that no network/community wants to exercise this power regularly or arbitrarily. When the Ethereum network was forked to fix The DAO token theft, people's discomfort, and debate about the real meaning of the "Code is Law" doctrine, allowed unscrupulous crypto money men to exploit the problem and create Ethereum Classic, which imo, caused widespread harm. 

So, in my view, we need to keep pushing forwards with systems and patterns that allow communities to fix problems themselves wherever possible, and the NNS should be a last resort, even when it might offer a shortcut to fixing problems. Hierarchies of domain-specific DAOs, snaps shots, and technical things like that, will provide the best way forward

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-27 13:18:47 UTC | #10

Yes, this hierarchy was also discussed as it would be great for the possibility to have a test/quality DAOs as controllers to push updates for when this inevitably happens again!

I think there would need to be some portability of II principals to work though‚Ä¶

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-27 13:20:49 UTC | #11

Thank you for posting your support Dom. Taggr is a great example of what can be achieved with the Internet Computer. I'm glad we can help them recover from this unfortunate accident.

-------------------------

Samer | 2023-03-27 13:30:04 UTC | #12

Hmm.

1. Taggr is great and deserves help. Check
2. Dfinity cant satisfy everyone when making choices. Check.
3. We want to avoid endless discussions and move forward. Check.
4. 'allow communities to fix problems themselves' check

But here's a totally honest question:
How is helping a project out by patching the system bring more value to our ecosystem?

Short answer will suffice.
(I use taggr and I love it)

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-27 13:33:50 UTC | #13

Here‚Äôs my view and one I shared with many people‚Ä¶ if the simplest of errors can blow up a dapp then there‚Äôs systemic platform risk and people either 1) won‚Äôt build on IC or 2) won‚Äôt decentralize 

Also what‚Äôs your Taggr name?! üòÇ

[quote="Samer, post:12, topic:19112"]

[/quote]

It brings more value by not scaring people away. If you show that even in the worst case we still don't say 'tough luck, try harder next time' but instead we say 'let's come together to find a way forward' it sends a strong signal that mistakes can be fixed, and that psychological safety of having some help available makes it IMO much easier to build something cool

-------------------------

Samer | 2023-03-27 13:58:31 UTC | #15

Fair point and this kind of flexibility is not toally wrong.

And I appreciate the willingness to let go of old entrenched crypto beliefs and move forward in a very practical manner.

But immutibility is core to the crypto ethos and one can argue that we only ought to perform system patches when absolutly needed

-------------------------

Samer | 2023-03-27 14:00:47 UTC | #16

Yes and thats what we should work on.

I want to agree, but please define "absolutely needed". For example, as we know NNS already has the ability to delete any canister, but will it be used to delete Spinner when "absolutely needed"?

The soul of DAO is public opinion, so just listen to the public by voting

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-27 15:49:47 UTC | #20

My concern with this DAO hierarchy is that the parent DAO's governance token detracts value from the child DAO's governance token. The child DAO's tokens are distributed as a result of some investment, which may be monetary, as is the case of Open Chat, or it could be in the form of engagement, as is the case in TAGGR .

If TAGGR tokens are the only way of updating the TAGGR canister, then these tokens are very valuable as they give exclusive control of TAGGR to the TAGGR investors. If we build this DAO hierarchy, now ICP tokens will give some level of control over every DAO, regardless of what the investors in the child DAO own. So TAGGR tokens no longer give exclusive control over the TAGGR canister.

These tokens are also important for the alignment of interests and incentives. ICP holders are aligned with ICP interests and TAGGR holders are aligned with TAGGR interests. Those token holders may not always be the same people and their interests may not always be aligned. In our current state, they probably are the same people with the same interests, but in the long term there could be users of TAGGR that know barely anything about ICP.

If the NNS crosses this line, it will not be able to come back. Anyone who wants to build a fully autonomous DAO will not build it on the IC, because they can't. They can at best, build a semi-autonomous DAO and hope that the parent DAO does not interfere in a way that is misaligned with the child DAO's interests.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-27 16:30:59 UTC | #21

But the NNS can delete a canister and therefore the child DAO today, correct?

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-27 16:36:46 UTC | #22

Yes, but deletion is arguably different from mutation, in that it's a more restricted operation.

I understand the urgency, but would appreciate to have a few days to review this code change before the final proposal is put forth.

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-27 16:57:22 UTC | #25

Please note, there will be a motion proposal first from the Taggr DAO themselves, explaining the recovery. Then the NNS DAO will decide if it wants to adopt this bail out proposal or not.

This patch will need to be built by DFINITY. It will be a small change executed on the Taggr canister only: it will add the NNS root canister as a second controller of Taggr, that‚Äôs it.

With this, Taggr DAO can submit a second proposal (the same one we use for upgrades of system canisters), which can then replace the binary of the Taggr canister to a correct one.

Let me know if you have more question.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-27 17:20:22 UTC | #26

Sorry, not sure I understand.  

Every single code change is a mutation, right?  On-chain governance = mutable code, right?

The NNS is a DAO and can vote no... I would like to ask that it votes yes but of course I am biased.  We were the first to decentralise and there were bound to be issues... I'm just glad they happened now before we had any real value or tradeable tokens.

However, I don't think there should be this purest immutability discussion about a chain which is by design mutable via on-chain governance.

There's a bigger risk that this negatively impacts decentralisation (ie projects deciding not to do it out of fear) or the disincentive to build on a platform that has simple recovery risk.

Those are bigger issues to me than asking for the NNS DAO to approve a mutation of the Taggr canister that will then allow the canister to be updated by the project team.  

In other words, we are representatives of TaggrDAO and we are asking the NNS DAO to help us update our canister with the correct binary.

Exactly. I‚Äôd like to see the code that does this.

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-27 17:46:54 UTC | #28

This code will be only created after we know whether NNS approved the bail out or not. 

After that, once the patched version is created, there will a normal blessing proposal for the replica version containing the Taggr hotfix and pointing to the code commit, as usual. So if you're reviewing the replica blessing proposals, you won't miss that one.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-27 18:05:16 UTC | #29

What does it mean to say that TaggrDAO will submit a proposal?

The NNS and the IC have no concept of TaggrDAO anymore. There's no way to prove _on-chain_ that the people submitting that proposal are the same people that owned the principals that governed TaggrDAO. The ecosystem is still small enough to be able to reasonably do this through social validation, but should we take each other at our word?

Do we have a way to prove that the canister ID is actually Taggrs? If we do that, then I guess it doesn't matter _who_ submits the proposal because we can verify the canister ID belongs to Taggr and we can verify the hash of the binary that is being submitted in the subsequent proposal.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-27 18:28:43 UTC | #30

I get your point and it's incredibly valid.

Is it sufficient enough that all 3 custom domains are pointing to this canister?

What about if we get the official Twitter account to tweet their canister ID?

I'm also surprised that there are no historical snapshots but here we are.

If it were a SNS controlled canister which is capable of being updated by the NNS will it have the dapp name hardcoded on it?  Or will the same logic apply?

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-27 19:13:59 UTC | #31

I talked to X. He‚Äôll add a TXT DNS record with the nns proposal id to taggr.link.

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-27 19:38:06 UTC | #34

As an alternative, I'd like to suggest that you spin up a new canister, recover its state from a backup, and ask the Internet Identity team to migrate existing users. (disclaimer: no idea how much effort/how feasible it is)

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-03-27 21:19:28 UTC | #35

This will create a precedent that can and will for sure be used by "bad actors/haters/competition" , not to mention it can lead to ppl who staked and lost access to Identity now standing in line ...

-------------------------

christian | 2023-03-28 05:10:51 UTC | #36

This was considered as a first solution. But you can‚Äôt ‚Äúmigrate existing users‚Äú. It would require a permanent, Taggr specific hack.

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-28 08:01:43 UTC | #37

A permanent, Taggr specific hack done in the II is still much much better than this NNS alternative.

Too many forum threads with murky agenda nowadays.

Crypto is an extremely dangerous space with plenty of actual money at stake and giving a second chance to an incompetent dev team just gives them another shot to screw up harder in the future.

Unless the screw up was on purpose for some reason?

I think that's way too harsh. I may not have a crazy amount of experience, but I've seen a fair amount of problems created even from people I consider to be in the top 1%. Even something like AWS fails every so often, even with hundreds of man-years spent on preventing exactly that. If you were to consequently apply this standard you probably shouldn't be using anything with a screen.

Not impossible, but if you're so suspicious I'd recommend you do [the verifications of IC binaries](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/voting-is-open-for-a-new-ic-release-5058a13/19076) too, which have much more at stake than Taggr. I look forward to seeing your feedback on these posts :wink:

-------------------------

Berg | 2023-03-28 12:30:07 UTC | #42

I'm sure there are plenty of good, hard-working people looking at the binaries.

Sure, anybody can just submit any proposal to NNS and wait for a vote. But voters, especially named neurons, must vote carefully. I see that the proposal is already out https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/115067, yet the discussion has barely begun.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-28 12:50:05 UTC | #44

Making a mistake does not infer incompetence. Taggr went into unchartered territories, alone...
Any dev team doing this will inevitably encounter issues.

We should be thanking them for their bravery and for providing this valuable lesson to the rest of the ecosystem, not criticizing them.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-28 12:59:25 UTC | #45

I hope we can set the precedent of helping others recover their apps and accounts in the future because of this.

DSCVR Internet Identity is split between many domains and I'm happy to see that we will provide the same continued level of support for those impacted as well as a way to provide social recovery for lost accounts in the future.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-03-28 13:02:34 UTC | #46

This is a good and valid point but has two sides that argue against or for setting a precedent since after all it is Immutable blockchain that is the underlaying thing that we are talking about.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-28 13:04:30 UTC | #47

Just a user here, but IDK how I feel about the idea of establishing this as a norm. Helping TAGGR makes sense to me because they are experimenting with DAOs in a way that no one but DF has really done so far. I expect mistakes to be made and for the NNS to help fix those mistakes.

For me, setting this expectation that the NNS will come to the rescue for individual accounts seems like a slippery slope and I don't know how we'd manage that as the network ecosystem grows.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-03-28 13:08:13 UTC | #48

Also just a simple user and huge fan of IC as far as technology goes but at the end of the day it all comes down to simple choice either do this and then do this for average Joe that staked for 8 years and lost his phone and has no seed or draw a line and law is law the same for anyone regardless.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-28 13:21:37 UTC | #49

There's a big difference here in my opinion. There are many people here to vouch for which canister ID was owned by Taggr, but only one person can vouch for their own Internet Identity principal.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-28 13:11:29 UTC | #50

I could be wrong but I don't believe those are our only two options. However, if I were to assume that you're right, I would choose to change my vote and reject. 

Thankfully, I don't believe that's the case.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-28 13:12:05 UTC | #51

DSCVR has done it's fair share of pioneering and has been careful enough to make good decision on the expectations of the technology.  Still with everything we have done there has been issues with lost accounts over internet Identity with thousands of ICP worth of NFTs lost.

What about ways to help them socially recover their accounts?  Why aren't they important also?

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-03-28 13:14:33 UTC | #52

Not gonna argue that BUT and I can't stress this enough : My opinion only ! Developers and specially teams should have more accountability than simple users. "the controller-id is set to null" ... then again I support any decision made by the Foundation and majority even though I do not agree

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-28 13:14:48 UTC | #53

Well, if DSCVR has a need due to their own pioneering I would hope you'd bring forward a solution in a proposal just like TAGGR has. What I don't want to see is the NNS turn into a help desk for recurring problems. I would expect most DAOs and Social Apps like your own to learn from your pioneering so the NNS doesn't have to solve these problems for them.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-28 13:15:18 UTC | #54

Hazel | 2023-03-28 13:29:58 UTC | #59

Well, this sucks doesn't it... Taggr is one of the ICs most unique products. They've been killing it out there. 

I do not want to argue for inaction here. But, this effectively is our "The DAO" event and is going to have massive implications if we casually commit to this. The NNS cannot be allowed full authority to arbitrarily modify canisters. If we allow and **continue to allow** that then we'll always just be building in someone else's playground - the exact thing I came to the IC to fight against.

@dominicwilliams, this is a practical solution and works great at our current stage of N<100 major projects. But, what happens when we hit critical mass start really start growing? If the goal is planet scale, open internet services, will an event like this even register on the NNS's radar; what is the plan here long term?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-28 13:32:46 UTC | #60

The point is that many people can vouch for Taggr's canister ID, but only one person can vouch for their lost Internet Identity. How can you trust that person is not lying about which identity that they're trying to claim is lost?

I have questioned the validity of determining Taggr's canister through social validation in my previous comments and I'm not comfortable with the idea, but it's not the same as this case with lost Internet Identity anchors. Going ahead with the former does not mean the latter should be gone ahead with too.

-------------------------

Zane | 2023-03-28 13:35:47 UTC | #61

I'm inclined to vote yes but only as long as this episode acts as a wake up call and leads to prioritize work so stuff like this doesn't happen again in the future. 
So far I'm not entirely sure that is the case considering the thread literally started with Dom saying:
>Going forwards, the consensus is that open internet services using this architecture assign the NNS DAO to the controller id, so that it can more easily act as a decentralized administrator of last resort if something likes this occurs.

I wonder whose consensus he is speaking about since the dicussions had barely started on Twitter when he wrote that. 
Even if we set aside the question of where this approach stands in relation to the crypto ethos, it doesn't seem to be scalable at all as @LightningLad91 pointed out, do we really expect stakers in the future to do due diligence everytime a dApp has issues? Wouldn't it instead be better to create an infrastructure that allows service owners to take care of it on their own?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-28 13:36:10 UTC | #62

Fwiw Rick I do appreciate you bringing up the establishment of a precedent. I‚Äôve started taking about this with others and am doing my own thinking on this. As much as I love TAGGR and what they‚Äôve done I‚Äôll need to consider the real implications of this decision.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-03-28 13:36:19 UTC | #63

Maybe DSCVR needs to spend more on teaching/training/guiding new users of the platform instead of promoting a new : "decentralized free and open speech platform " without any reference to the number 1 rule being " 1. You will not create content or participate in a manner that violates United States Law."

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-28 13:36:23 UTC | #64

Define many. Is that how you determined Taggrs canister was valid?  Saw all the messages and were like, ok its officially reached `many` its legit now.  

How can we can create path for social recovery for Internet Identities so it reaches the @NathanosDev Threshold of Many to be a valid social recovery?

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-03-28 13:38:47 UTC | #65

There is no ONLY , if it happens it is a precedent. Plain and simple either it applies  to everyone or no one.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-03-28 13:40:21 UTC | #66

I already said that I was not on board with social validation, but it's a logical conclusion that "many" !== "one" and when it comes to social validation, more is always going to be better.

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-28 13:40:37 UTC | #67

I also really like TAGGR and what they have done, I don't know who X is, but Im certain he was heart broken when they saw the fucking `Could not find the canister ID.` as I have stared many times at that screen wondering what the hell I did wrong.  X did everything they could have done to fully recover the platform, but they took things one step further and hit a pretty significant road block, so we should help out... but this is pandoras box.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-03-28 17:52:19 UTC | #68

After giving it some more thought and having a coffee, I've come up with a more comprehensive list of questions:

1. If this proposal passes, what guidelines and criteria will be established to determine the execution of similar proposals in the future? How can we ensure consistency and fairness in decision-making?

2. What implications does executing this proposal have for the extent of control the NNS has over the contents of the Internet Computer? Ideally, how much influence should the NNS exert over the application layer to maintain decentralization?

3. Is there a risk of majority voters within the NNS abusing this power to take malicious actions against minority groups with legitimate projects (and how do we define 'legitimate')? What safeguards can be put in place to protect projects from potential misuse of power by bad actors?


I think where I've ended up is that I cannot even consider going along with this unless we know the answers to these questions. Taggr is such a wonderful application and I really don't want to see the community get hurt by this. I really want us to help them. However, it's crucial that we also protect the integrity of the Internet Computer as a whole.


Edit 1. To be explicit. I personally I am not comfortable with the NNS having any control over canisters which have not explicitly designated the NNS as their controller.

voters, especially named neurons, must vote carefully. I see that the proposal is already out [Proposal: 115067 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/115067), yet the discussion has barely begun.
[/quote]

To be honest, I think it‚Äôs pretty common to see a major uptick in the discussion after the proposal is submitted to the NNS.  The formality of that process drives a lot of engagement that often isn‚Äôt seen pre proposal.  A lot of the people who do engage and watch the forum for new Governance topics are part of Taggr Network and have already commented here or discussed it on the new TaggrDAO discord (and probably the VIP discord).  I think it‚Äôs also taking a little longer for opposition to surface on this proposal because a lot of the people who typically offer harsh criticism of DFINITY are members of the Taggr Network and want to see the community restored.  Hence, I think discussion among the broader IC community wouldn‚Äôt happen on this topic until the proposal is submitted anyway.

kpeacock | 2023-03-28 17:25:48 UTC | #70

I'd like the NNS to rescue Taggr, and then immediately revoke its own authority to do so.

We should save the app, thank them for revealing a DX weakness of IC development, and then build a more appropriate set of well-scoped tools for rescuing stuck dapps in the future.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-28 17:29:42 UTC | #71

I think this is where defining principles for NNS and what it should and shouldnt do can really help and can be relied on

I'd like to see taggr helped but I also think NNS has far too much uncontrolled power and it creates platform risk for builders 

I'm not sure if Dfinity is ready to touch this subject again so soon

-------------------------

northman | 2023-03-28 17:44:08 UTC | #72

Any canister is subject to the will of the NNS vote and could always have its controllership re-assigned, code modified or state changed.  "Black-holed" canisters are not inviolable - even though they were 
 thought to be.

The approach of a replica change for this fix seems to be counter-culture.  I agree we need tools get folks out of jams without requiring an NNS vote ever again - Kyle's point.

We also need more people involved in validating builds before pushing code rather than relying on a person.

This would satisfy all of my concerns. And, would be an easy way to harden the network. Win for Taggr, Win for the IC.

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 17:57:05 UTC | #74

Really appreciate the thoughtful feedback and I agree those questions need to be answered...but in this case it is literally the DAO (who was) responsible for the canister asking the NNS to help.  

If you don't accept our social recovery proof namely the DNS TXT message for the custom domains used for Taggr that is a different challenge.  However it this scenario it is the TaggrDAO asking the NNS DAO to help it's canister.

If it can't or chooses not to then we have to really question any compelling reason to decentralize on a platform that has risk of recovery or an ability to fork due to II principals being locked to one canister... in other words technical platform risk.  Why would anyone choose to decentralize their app with these technical risks.

As for the community... they and their continued support has been nothing short of amazing... it's a good thing we never sold anything other than trying to push the boundaries of decentralization... so this could have been A LOT worse!

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 18:00:49 UTC | #75

Love this idea!  In this case we are pretty clear we are asking the NNS DAO for it's support... I do agree with all the discussions around precedents and slipper slopes and it works both ways IMO of not interfering in those who don't want you to but supporting those who do.

[/quote]

I think you would have to believe that DFINITY is a bad actor for this to be an issue.  We can discuss motion proposals all we want, but nothing changes by way of code from the result of motion proposals.  Those code changes happen on proposal topics that fall into the All Topics catch all category and 99.4% of total voting power in the NNS follows DFINITY on those topics.  Hence, decentralization occurs when people and organizations start voting independently on these other topics.  Personally, I support this TaggrDAO rescue proposal because I think recovery from mistakes is important, especially for ICP growth and mainstream adoption.  However, I think it‚Äôs conceivable that there will be changes that DFINITY is compelled to implement where the NNS community would not even have the option of blocking because of default following and lack of independent voting on the topics that change code.  DFINITY would not be a bad actor in those situations.  They would simply be the only real contributor to the IC and they would be doing what they are compelled to do.  DFINITY is our safeguard and it is not possible for bad actors to misuse power against projects.  If you think decentralization is the safeguard, then we have a long way to go and people / organizations need to start seriously considering reviewing and voting independently on proposals that change the code.  Ironically, only DFINITY has been pushing for this kind of governance participation so far.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-03-28 18:07:30 UTC | #77

I understand that you have a lot going on right now. And, you didn't ask to suddenly be the center of this huge issue. Following @kpeacock's lead. Thank you for discovering and brining these issues to the centerstage. It's a really shit place to be in. I really want to get you unblocked.

The issue isn't that you can't prove who you are.  The issue is that at a quick glance the obvious answer is: "Yeah we should help them Duh?!". And, I agree we should. What I'm trying to bring attention to is that there are serious consequences to helping you without an absolute rock solid plan of what happens to the NNS next.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-03-28 18:12:06 UTC | #78

There are so many well reasoned arguments on both sides of the issue.

This really highlights the issue of decentralization and how young and concentrated the VP of the IC still is.

It makes sense then why big money interests would NOT choose IC knowing that their app could be not just deleted, but modified at any point, given that such a large portion of voting power is held by the foundation? There‚Äôs already platform risk building on the IC, this just adds to the risk.

Even if a canister is blackholed, it is still mutable through the protocol.

What happens if in response to https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-and-kyt-compliance/18754, Spinnr builds their own no-KYT wBTC and authorities see the weak link and crack down on DFINITY to use the NNS as a trapdoor in the future?

Question for the Taggr team, users, @mechaquan, and X. Would you advocate for this proposal if it happened to another app on the IC? Seers, AstroX, Kinic, Distrikt, or DSCVR? Where do you draw the line, does the app need to be ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù?

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 18:14:33 UTC | #79

Thanks appreciate the kind words!

I completely agree... there needs to be a very clear process for helping DAOs who are decentralized in the future and some fixes that don't make builders feel like they're building on sand with the smallest and simplest (trust me is was so simple :joy:) of human errors leading to a canister being locked.

This was an incredible revelation for me because I really don't see the case for decentralizing your dapp on the IC at this moment due to simple lack of tools or process to fix.

Also, to add, if we had a SNS we would be doing the same thing (minus the interim step of adding NNS as a controller) of asking the NNS DAO to push an update to the canister.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 18:18:43 UTC | #80

Again, to me the question is whether you trust or believe in the social recovery.  We are asking the NNS DAO who can decide via voting to execute an action onto us.

If the question, was we are advocating for an action on to someone else without any proof of social recovery it's 100% a flat no from me.

So to answer your question, of course I would support the social recovery of any dapp on the IC providing that proof is sufficient.

And again, we are here because we were truly decentralized and the IC is lacking the tools to restore or fork due to the II limitaitions.  If we had a SNS we would be in this same scenario.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2023-03-28 18:23:22 UTC | #81

Size or name of the app are not relevant. It was a mistake, which can be recovered using the NNS. From this situation, lessons learned and better system tooling to prevent this issue affecting other dapps building on IC.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-03-28 18:48:35 UTC | #82

Makes sense, but I think we both can agree that this would definitely be a new/different mental framework for application owners and developers to buy into going forward.

I‚Äôm all for social recovery (which could be set up to recover an Internet Identity btw), but this feels like social modification, given that controllers are being added through an replica protocol change.

An additional question. If the NNS DAO can exert itself like this from time to time, or even more frequently as you‚Äôve suggested, what are the benefits of owning and staking $CHAT or any DAO token instead of $ICP?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-28 19:44:11 UTC | #83

Every time a big event exposes a vulnerability or division of opinion - Super Mario, Boundary Nodes, Treasury, KYT, crypto economic changes, Scaling issues etc - we as a community massively benefit from the debate and as a result it usually results in a hardening of the system. 

It seems most folks are OK with moving forward with helping Taggr provided we implement processes and norms to prevent this from happening again. Those who are very anxious about the downstream effects of allowing the NNS to do this should propose solutions, but that shouldn‚Äôt stop us from moving forward now. Dfinity should be involved too. 

I‚Äôd like to point out while this thread has a mixture of opinions, it has not descended into toxic, ad hominem attacks. I‚Äôd like to call out this thread as a model template for how we should conduct debate in the future.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-28 20:11:21 UTC | #84

This is basically how governance has moved forward throughout time. Sometimes the governors get it right and sometimes wrong.  We can try to make a good decision and then move forward.

Culture exists to overcome the mere survival of the fittest.  We can be better than raw nature at helping people live full lives. Maybe we need some more mantras:

Not your code, Not your canister
Social Recovery or Recovery Misery
Public utility funding builds trust, VC funding leads to secrecy and lust.
Seed protection, data's lifeline connection.
Upgrade success? Backup first!

Only some of the above were written by an AI. :joy:

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 20:21:48 UTC | #85

$ICP is the governance token that controls the NNS

$CHAT is the governance token that controls the OpenChat SNS

What happens if the OC SNS gets stuck and there‚Äôs millions locked in the dapp?!  Game over?!  No, you ask the NNS DAO for help!

This is by design and the whole purpose of the NNS/ICP.

The NNS can vote to delete any canister and make updates to any canister.  We‚Äôre debating whether it should or shouldn‚Äôt and completely agree there needs to be strict governance on how or when.  I‚Äôm just saying by design it can and as a DAO built wholly on the NNS we are asking for it to intervene on our behalf.  That is all.  The NNS can help‚Ä¶will it?  

If not now, is there a time when it will?  If not, then why bother to decentralize or build on it?

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 20:24:25 UTC | #86

I appreciate the dialogue because regardless of the outcome for Taggr‚Ä¶we were the first to experience this but certainly not the last.

I am really happy we have the boundary node solution for ‚Äúillegal‚Äù content because otherwise we would be in a tricky situation.

I imagine Spinnr is understandably worried some authority (Swiss or US government) might pressure Dfinity to vote to use the NNS to shut them down. 

I think the likelihood of this happening is WAY lower because of the boundary node architecture. I really hope it is delivered ASAP.

I would imagine over time, scale will give the lower hierarchy tokens a lot of power in practice. When there are millions of dapps on IC, the NNS won't be able to mediate all of them. Probably like how the US Federal Court system has 94 district courts, 13 circuit courts, and a supreme court. Supreme court only hears very few cases that have successfully appealed district and circuit courts.

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-28 21:51:02 UTC | #89

I would be comfortable with this one-off recovery only if:

1. The NNS should first pass a governance proposal, declaring that it would never assign itself as a controller of another canister, unless a) there is a security incident, b) the last owner prior to the security incident provably submits a proposal asking the NNS for help, and c) the community agrees via NNS voting.
2. The proposal from Taggr should clearly state its purpose: it wants to fork the IC network after a security incident, and not disguise it as "social recovery". The NNS would be voting on whether to adopt the new fork as mainnet.
3. After the incident is resolved, the NNS shall immediately revoke its power to add itself as a controller to other canisters by performing a code upgrade (if applicable).

This is a very dangerous feature. The NNS would need to deliberately increase the barrier in order to use such a feature, and make it apparent to the entire community what it's actually doing (i.e. forking the network), so that people can properly weigh the pros & cons.

NathanosDev | 2023-03-28 22:01:38 UTC | #90

We should probably change this...

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-28 22:06:06 UTC | #91

We shouldn't change this promise. Instead we're forking the network (if NNS votes so).

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-03-28 22:46:19 UTC | #92

I feel very uncomfortable with voting yes on this proposal, and I am leaning towards voting no.

This will set a precedent that may be extremely difficult to deal with in the future.

There is the ability to recover the application apparently because of backups. There is an issue with IIs, but perhaps that is the price to be paid. Or, I would love to see a solution that allows greater portability/recovery of IIs.

I would also like to call out the difference between an application controlled by a DAO and an immutable/autonomous application. Taggr was apparently not immutable nor autonomous, as a group of people had the ability to upgrade it. This group of people used that power and unfortunately made a mistake that affected all users without their consent. They had no guarantees that this would not happen, guarantees they might have enjoyed with a truly immutable canister.

I think we should consider the power of immutable applications that can't have their binaries updated. That doesn't mean the application can't be updated, just that the binary is deployed and fixed to a canister. An upgrade process would require a new set of canisters to be created, and data and accounts to be ported over. Ideally each individual would have the choice to port themselves over to the new app, ensuring maximum decentralization.

I think the idea of completely mutable binaries is very dangerous and potentially antithetical to the idea of decentralization and autonomy. Of course it's convenient, but it trades off security and decentralization because the binary can be changed at any time, meaning literally anything about the application can be changed.

I rambled a bit there. In the end, I lean towards not supporting a bailout at the replica level. We should look into allowing IIs to port easily instead, which would help us to embrace truly immutable canisters. Mutable binaries are dangerous. They have a place but they are dangerous.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-03-28 23:22:23 UTC | #94

Appreciate the feedback Jordan‚Ä¶ we never claimed to have an immutable canister although maybe it qualifies now! üòÇ

But a DAO that can have code changes submitted by a person and voted on by DAO members‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt this define the NNS?!

There are weekly code changes to the ICP voted on by the NNS DAO.

Also, there are many additional II related challenges that prevented us from just migrating to a new canister this is a protocol problem and and akin to platform risk‚Ä¶we have the backup and this was our first choice which was discussed and ruled out.

Bottomline we are asking the NNS DAO to help with updating our canister‚Ä¶similar process if it was a SNS.

We accept the results of the NNS DAO but it opens the discussion about whether decentralising an app on the IC makes sense because this problem is almost guaranteed to happen again.

Going forwards, the consensus is that open internet services using this architecture assign the NNS DAO to the controller id, so that it can more easily act as a decentralized administrator of last resort if something likes this occurs.

If the IC is going to succeed we need to start with the right presuppositions. Any canister on the IC can be updated by the NNS via a replica upgrade. Full stop. Unless you want to get rid of the NNS completely, I don't see a way around this.  If the mob can vote to kill/update/usurp any canister on the network via code upgrade then your only choice is a governance engineering exercise that sets up boundaries, checks and balances and other institutions that reduce the likelihood of mob rule.

The ICDevs dev board seems pretty split and I'm getting convinced that we shouldn't accept this current proposal, should regroup, and offer a more comprehensive proposal that meets the governance goals and ethos goals that seem to be present.

1. No one wants the NNS to be a vote away from coercing someone's canister.
2. The NNS in all constructions that allow replica upgrades will be one vote away from coercing any canister on the network.
3. Give the mob a viable, easier path canister recovery that works well when we want it to and becomes very hard to corrupt.  We may need to use some game theory here.

A modest proposal:

1. Create an SNS DAO called Social Recovery.  
2. Let people put in ICP and get tokens. 
3. Do our best to anti-bot it.
4. Collect a treasury.

The Social Recovery DAO only has these functions:

1. SRDAO elects 21(other number?) Doxed Community delegates to sign for the DAO.
2. A person wanting social recovery must submit a proposal that has a non-insignificant fee.  This fee is split between paying the delegates for review and making determinations and paying out to Token holders.  Delegates also get paid from the treasury per proposal via a treasury proposal.  Token holders can veto this if they feel the delegates did a bad job.
3. Delegates can accept the proposal to update the canister controllers which sends a controller update to the NNS.
4. The NNS can veto it.  If it is vetoed, fees go into the treasury.

- Delegates are incentivized to only let items through that will pass the NNS.
- Token holders are incentivized to elect competent delegates.

Maybe spam proposals are hiding in here somewhere.  More thought is certainly needed.

Exactly, this is how the NNS works. And I think the NNS has some major drawbacks because of this. It also has major benefits because of this. But its decentralization and autonomy is questionable because it can be upgraded at any time. I would like to see the NNS's scope reduced to the minimum possible. I think canisters should seek to reduce their upgradability to the minimum possible as well.

Tough problem of course...

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-03-29 00:07:43 UTC | #98

We don't have to go down this path here, but I absolutely agree that we need more checks and balances. Right now there are a few monolithic powers in the system with few checks on that power.

Voters aren't split up into groups that can balance and check each other, such as with the electoral college in the USA and researchers, client teams, and validators on Ethereum.

If a proposal goes up and passes the vote, that's it. It's a simple democracy which can lead to mob rule (that's what it is now).

Imagine, just as one hypothetical example, that node operators had the ability or duty to also approve all replica updates, or perhaps the power to veto.

Again I don't want to derail the thread, but I agree that we need more diverse groups with different incentives and viewpoints to create appropriate checks and balances within the system.

The NNS right now is just a simple majority-takes-all democracy, and I don't think it's sophisticated enough to achieve our vision of a secure and stable world computer.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-29 00:27:39 UTC | #99

@lastmjs my understanding is that the NNS can only work from a code perspective with simple majority rule. 

Are you suggesting building off chain voting norms and structures to supplement the on chain voting or are you suggesting somehow adjusting the way the NNS actually approves proposals from a technical standpoint? 

There is a fundamental difference here. One is about how we operate as people and another is how the code governs the IC. Hope that distinction is clear.

-------------------------

I can't really know for sure unless I was put under the same stress, but I hope I would advocate in exactly the same way I'm advocating now.

Boot up the project again, port all of the IIs, learn from the mistakes and never do it again. If the IIs can't be ported, perhaps seek a remedy at the II level since that's at the application layer controlled by the NNS, and I find that less harmful/less precedent-setting than a replica change.

I would seek every way to stop this from happening again, and I think portable IIs or other auth systems that allow users to port to another version of the app would be the way to go.

[quote="dfisher, post:99, topic:19112"]

I don't think so. The NNS could be programmed to enforce that a proposal can never be passed by one neuron, regardless of the voting power. I don't see why it couldn't enforce a minimum neuron count with a minimum percentage of voting power per neuron to pass a proposal. Add ZK identities in the future and perhaps we get to a better one-person-one-vote combined with quadratic/logarithmic voting situation.

For example, for any proposal to pass, no fewer than 5 neurons must cast a vote and no individual neuron can contribute more than 1% of the voting power. Just a simple example.

We talk so much about deterministic decentralization at the subnet level, but don't apply it to voting at all!

-------------------------

rckprtr | 2023-03-29 02:41:17 UTC | #103

I believe the II could be changed such that if the derivation origin is the old taggr canister Id that it hits a hardcoded list of ii-alternative-origins and all II accounts for taggr are recoverable.

@kpeacock is this correct?

I believe this wouldn't require anything special from the NNS and just frontend change to the II.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-03-29 02:53:55 UTC | #104

If true, seems a much better solution without a dangerous precedent. Even if II canisters must be changed, seems a better choice.

But perhaps we can generalize the solution so that all apps can have this capability.

Imagine the II canisters are changed to allow applications to setup alternate domains for these types of situations with legacy apps, and it takes a proposals or something to add them in.
