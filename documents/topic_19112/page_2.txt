Hmm not sure I understand. The NNS DAO makes decisions according to votes by neuron holders, who have staked ICP, and then executes them automatically. We've long wanted to introduce neuron up-weights by Proof of Personhood, to blend per-person voting with by-capital voting, but we don't have the technical solution yet. Nevertheless, it's probably the most decentralized and well-functioning, as well as the most technically capable, DAO in the world. Something that can never be changed though: people will have differing opinions, and will find themselves for or against proposals that do or do not get adopted. Not sure anyone has ever found a technical solution to that. 

The purpose of the NNS DAO, which is permissionless, is to govern the network in a more open way. If you want to say "permissioned by permissionless governance" I could agree with that. But can you point to another network that has found a better solution?

Great proposal. We can set a higher voting threshold for NNS intervening in the case of a CODE_IS_LAW canister. Like 95% Yes.

Hey @dominicwilliams thanks for sharing your perspective and historical context.  I think your proposal makes a lot of sense.  Also, regardless of how this current proposal turns out and regardless whether DFINITY votes or not, I don’t think this discussion or solution needs to end here.  Generally I have observed that people don’t start engaging deeply until a formal proposal is put forth and in this case a lot of ideas have surfaced.  It seems logical to me for DFINITY and the community to iterate on solutions that make sense.  I wouldn’t be opposed to seeing a revised proposal put forth if the deliberation on this proposal sparks you to consider amendments to your original proposal.  I think opinions change throughout a deliberation like this and people who vote one way may vote another way when new information and ideas surface after they vote.  It helps a lot to better understand some of the design consideration for the purpose of the NNS as well as what technical solutions could exist, so thanks for sharing.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-31 15:17:28 UTC | #215

DFinity neutrality and voting patterns cant be questionable.  They can vote any way they feel any day depending on their mood, context, new information, changing philosophy, emotion. They are a free participant like all of us. They are not anybody's babysitter.

I would prefer any canister to be able to mark itself as code is law, rather than having to deploy to specific subnets. And I wonder if this is almost the case now, by setting the NNS as a controller explicitly. Then we could reduce the NNS's capabilities across all subnets, unless canisters explicitly choose the NNS as a controller.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-31 16:07:23 UTC | #217

I’m thinking the benefit of separate subnets is that it means separate hardware. 

Separate hardware means if the government wants to come confiscate the servers where the assassination market lies, then it can do so without impacting the NPs who have agreed to put the NNS in charge. 

Separate subnets also provide different guarantees to node providers. I myself am a node provider and I would not want assassination markers held on my subnet. I would like the NNS to come deal with that asap. 

There are risks everywhere. There’s a risk if you put the NNS in charge it could abuse that authority. There’s a risk that if you make the code is law you’ll get assassination markets inviting nation states to clamp down. There’s no perfect system. 

I agree with @dominicwilliams designing a system that allows people to take the risks and safeguards they so choose would be ideal. 

But Dom’s point that the IC has always been advertised as a network governed by a DAO is seriously underrated. Dfinity has been remarkably consistent in this vision and it’s what drew me and many others in.

## Largest and the Only Contributor Dictates the Network

DFINITY - claims to be a non-profit organization, and has been the creator and the major ‘contributor’ ( as it likes to call itself ) of this blockchain. To put things in perspective, if DFINITY were to vanish overnight, there are no bug-fixers, developers, and overseer’s of network.

Network may as well crash without DFINITY being there to monitor and maintain it. Therefore, the builders and community members need to place a lot of trust on DFINITY to be a good actor and not abuse its powers.

There are few examples of DFINITY abusing its power and undermining the credible neutrality. ICP was marketed as an alternate to corporate cloud for avoiding platform risk. But NNS and DFINITY itself create a palpable platform risk to build on ICP. This is just DAO politics.

DFINITY, being the largest influencer of ICP, only promotes the project in which it has vested interest.

You can basically scroll and find that DFINITY Twitter only promotes its employees or the dapps that it has vested interests with such as Entrepot and other dapps leveraging Entrepot NFT marketplace.


So far, dfinity has almost always voted yes on ICPMN’s proposals, an organization with which they are very close with.

This gives both of them leverage to spin and control their narratives to snowball their influence even further, to the point that it impacts the developer environment and user experience in the ecosystem.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2023-03-31 16:46:50 UTC | #219

Could you see how the following could be a barrier to 
a) entry for the current web 3 community
b) retention of Web 3 audience
c) staking
d) build on ICP
 from a fully non-technical point:

* NNS power and control over canisters
* NNS insufficiently Decentralized
* NNS historical votes to change critical, financially impacting, changes like Tokenomics and voting

Appreciate that Decentralization takes time but leaves things in a chicken and egg situation 

Its possible you feel none of this is a cause for concern and it would naturally work itself out
ETH is much further along the scale of decentralization and perhaps you feel the same will happen to ICP but I'd also like to remind that ETH had a long period with no real competition whereas ICP has plenty of competition with more successful communities and inflow of liquidity and building with super strong partnerships

My personal experience in trying to recruit as well as retain community members to ICP is that: 
- The Mentioned points play a big part in inhibiting building community 
- The vision Dfinity promotes often perceived to be at conflict with NNS voting and reality 

The above is leaving out how the communities I'm involved in perceives a lot of other areas involving dfinity 

Decentralization needs Adoption, Adoption needs decentralization so bit of a catch 22

My final thoughts on this:

- If Dfinity cant unite its own builders under the same umbrella and vision
- If Dfinity cannot build up, promote, support and enrich the current projects who have proven resilient 
- If Dfinity cannot help engage, entertain, retain and recruit a community to sustain projects building on ICP

It has a few challenging years ahead, especially without the snowball effect that retaining the current builders can offer 


Everything stated above is from personal experience and engagement over a 2 year period and not from a technical standpoint, I hope it adds some value or insight from someone Invested ICP and its communities, at this point, purely out of passion.

I wouldn't say that ETH is much further along in the decentralization process, and that isn't meant to throw shade at them, because we love Ethereum. 

One of the greatest misconceptions in crypto, is that having thousands of validator nodes running on Big Tech's cloud infrastructure represents decentralization. I haven't see the latest stats, but articles like this provide some color from last year https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-cloud-providers-accounting-for-over-two-thirds-of-ethereum-nodes-data – more than half run on Amazon Web Services. 

Currently I'm seeing 560,000 validator nodes being reported by Ethereum https://ethereum.org/en/staking/

But, based on that previous breakdown, we might expect 300,000+ of those nodes to be running on Amazon Web Services, which in reality, is just one giant node machine controlled by a corporation. Sure, the network is replicating computation and data hundreds of thousands of times on that giant node machine controlled by the corporation, which is expensive and makes them lots of money, but it doesn't increase the Nakamoto Coefficient of the network. Amazon could take control of those validators, or switch them off at any time, just like Hetzner just did to 40% of Solana's network https://decrypt.co/113429/is-solana-decentralized-cloud-provider-hetzner-ban-raises-questions

Such Proof-of-Stake architectures result in a situation where the number of real nodes is vastly lower than the number of validator nodes advertised (and I mean VASTLY, as in a tiny fraction of a percent). Many whales also run huge number of individual validators – so validator count is a very misleading measure of decentralization. 

Moxie, the developer of Signal, made a really insightful post about Web3 decentralization on these platforms, see https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html

Proof-of-Useful-Work, a la the Internet Computer, which builds a network on standardized dedicated (sovereign) hardware run by independent parties, which identifies those node providers, so that "deterministic decentralization" can generate required Nakamoto Coefficients more reliably while minimizing replication and cost has major advantages, and one of those is surely increasing the reliability of decentralization. 

Likewise, in the end, using an opaque system for updating blockchain networks through network forks, which in are ultimately coordinated by project insiders, also has issues regarding decentralization (aside from the technical risk, inefficiency, politics and so on).

That's why the Internet Computer network has a permissionless DAO at its core, which automates updating and configuring the network in a transparent way, as well as reducing technical risk, and efficiency – allowing for adaptive operation and rapid evolution. 

We still live in a world where crypto promotes thousands of anonymous Proof-of-Stake validators, which are mostly running on Big Tech's centralized cloud services, as a mark of decentralization, and commercial incentives have persuaded many this is the case, but it's really the opposite. That's also true of updating networks via forks.

That the Internet Computer runs on a network of sovereign hardware (much like Bitcoin whose blocks are produced by dedicated ASICs), and is updated and configured by the Network Nervous System DAO, is something this community should be immensely proud of. 

For those that want to see a true World Computer, which allows people to build on the decentralized internet, rather than Big Tech's centralized infrastructure, and allows Web3 builders to create end-to-end decentralized services that run fully on-chain under the control of DAOs, this is the real deal.

The Internet Computer pushes the boundaries of what a compute platform can do, enabling people to build using tamperproof, unstoppable and autonomous smart contracts that can process tokens, which here can do things like web serving and http outcalls, but it also pushes the boundaries of the decentralization of blockchain networks.

I appreciate the achievement Dfinity and ICP has accomplished so far Dom and I can't argue a lot of what you've mentioned conceptually 

Here's just 2 simple questions a company might ask before using a cloud service? 

Who could take me down?
-Using AWS:
- OFC AWS

-Using ICP 
- Dfinity 

What are the risks to my app? 
-Using AWS 
- AWS taking me down but I'm legally protected 

-Using ICP 
- Dfinity and Synapse, no real legal protection

Take all the Jargon away and boil it down to the ultimate people or entities behind decisions and while the tech may be fantastic and can eventually lead to decentralization, we have to trust we'll get there 

These concerns are not really addressed in this message and steps have not been seen to be taken to reassure those who believe decisions will be sufficiently decentralised:
[quote="theguy, post:222, topic:19112"]

When the real impactful decision is in the hands of many REAL people like with ETH, we would have a convincing argument to say we truly are decentralized 

We're not at that point and we can speak about AWS vs our inhouse nodes - however I haven't had or witnessed any real conversion from these arguments - It always ends with "Who has the power to make the decisions"

I don't really have an argument as such here, I don't want to prove anything, but I want to portray what were up against and I want to express that these arguments aren't effective when push comes to shove 

I hope I've atleast given some food for thought here on how split the internal community within ICP with basic fundamental views and if you so wish, what issues you could look to tackle to bring forth some unity within and to enforce confidence for other builders to join 

Regardless, I pray, with time, the decentralized MECHANISM of NNS will enable acceptable levels decentralization over time to increase confidence, even if we're not there currently

Appreciate ICP offers a lot of positives and its not something I personally need to be sold on

Sharing, from my experience, that what we sell as our biggest advantage against AWS, i.e. no centralized decision, is currently seen by those I engage with as our biggest area of concern

This may also be the reason many associate ICP as a scam since there are nuanced dualities

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-03-31 19:14:04 UTC | #230

A Proof-of-Stake "validator" node is software, not hardware, which is why it is so easy to spin up zillions of them on Big Tech cloud services, like Amazon Web Services. But that's just a giant computing hardware infrastructure run by Amazon, with a virtualization layer. Not only can Amazon switch off the validators if they like, but they can also access the cryptographic keys the validators use to identify themselves on the network. Since Amazon is running the majority of Ethereum nodes, it could rewind the chain any time it likes and fork a new longest chain. 

Point being: despite all the hyperbole about Ethereum having 500,000+ validators, the reality is that most of them run on Amazon Web Services, and thus Amazon really does control that chain. They're just not currently exercising that control.

But Solana's experience with Hetzner, and the hostile regulatory environment, means this kind of thing should be taken seriously.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-03-31 19:54:09 UTC | #231

Amazon fully controls Amazon Web Services, and that means that Proof-of-Stake chains that host the majority of their validator nodes there, such as Ethereum, are in essence controlled by Amazon and Uncle Jeff too (they just haven't chosen to exercise that control so far).

Wrt to the Internet Computer, the difference with hosting on Amazon, is that DFINITY has a strong influence over the network, but certainly not control, although I would agree that it plays a fairly essential role in the ecosystem because of its ability to make ongoing technical contributions (but so do others play essential roles, such as the independent node providers who create the physical network using the technology, and the independent ecosystem builders that drive the network economy and make it a great place to be). 

Some v important points on subject of control:

* DFINITY doesn't have a majority of the voting power in the NNS, and although many people follow our votes (i.e. have their neurons configured to follow our neurons), anybody, at any time, can independently decide who they follow.

* We often abstain from voting, largely out of paranoia we will accused of being Big Brother or something, or because we worry about conflict of interest (even when arguably we often shouldn't, as many Dfinitians dedicate their lives to the network, and have highly informed opinions).

* Some people imagine that DFINITY has a key that it uses to control the DFINITY neuron that a lot of people follow, but that wouldn't be secure, and that's not what happens. Our neuron is what is known as a "managed neuron," which means that there is no key that controls it. Instead, our neuron follows the neurons of a whole load of crypto engineers and researchers, who collectively, are able to update who it follows, and who collectively determine how it votes.

Tl;dr; there is no real comparison between building on a decentralized network/world computer blockchain like the Internet Computer, and Amazon Web Services. We don't have Uncle Jeff, who can arbitrarily take down a service like Parler because he doesn't like its politics (and by implication, for competitive/business reasons, or because he was asked to by regulators). 

What happened to Solana wrt Hetzner reflects the dangers of building Web3 services using cloud (which, aside from the issue of giving the cloud control, also makes them insecure, unable to assign control to a DAO, and therefore unable to tokenize for regulatory reasons, but I digress), or a blockchain on cloud.

There is no software like what dfinity have been able to provide for the world! No one questions that…
I think the concern that lies with majority of the developers who question the decentralization of the network is how updates are made. Majority of the developers actually like the NNS but how it is maintained needs more clarity. Often people don’t like change, but for growth change is necessary and inevitable. My thought is that the voting mechanism that goes in maintaining the NNS is not well understood among many developers hence the difference in opinions.

On this point, implementing the followee reset that was voted in by NNS would definitely be a step towards expressing Dfinitys commitment towards decentralisation

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-03-31 20:02:58 UTC | #234

There are technical docs online that describe how it works, but it's probably not digestible enough currently.

We also build and update dashboards to try and make it more transparent, which probably need to be part of the NNS one day (see dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance and dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons).

Essentially though, its an algorithmic liquid democracy, where voting power derives from staked capital, which creates voting neurons, and neuron voting can be automated by configuring them to follow other neurons.

Proposals are adopted either when they acquire 51% of all possible votes, or when voting activity goes quiet (using a variation of the original Wait For Quiet algorithm proposal).

Regarding change. One day things will slow down, there will be university departments debating everything that is proposed, etc, but the network is still young, and it's good that its evolution is rapid. The internet wasn't built in a day...

Main thing is making it more and more capable and growing while maintaining security – since that's obviously a key part of the network's promise.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-03-31 20:13:58 UTC | #235

These things are being worked on, but pulling off a reset is no mean feat for a bunch of reasons.

Some other changes we need imo:

* Neurons should be either Private (default) or Public. It should be impossible to get information about Private neurons. On the other hand, Public neurons, which are controlled by people and groups who invite others to follow them, should display their locked capital, other configurations, and voting history, etc

* When a neuron votes, it should be using a cryptographic blinding mechanism. Decentralization of governance will benefit enormously from such privacy, for the similar reasons democracies don't let you see how people such as your neighbors and friends vote in an election (prevents coercion, fear of rejections, and other influences being applied, so that votes truly are free). 

* A neuron's follow relationships should also be concealed. This is difficult to do cryptographically currently – at least efficiently – which is why in my original BNS post I proposed that voting, including automated voting, is driven by client devices, which can then store the follow relationships, such that it would be impossible to get hold of them (again, similar thinking to previous point)

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-31 20:33:45 UTC | #236

Thankyou, that's reassuring to hear and the display of the commitment to decentralisation will be very positive both within and outside the eco 

We still have a lot of the fundamentals to build out but also a lot of exciting changes this year both at protocol and project levels 

I hope we continue building with Security, reliability interoperablity and user experience in mind 

When we can reassure people our ethos and capability matched our vision, I'm confident we'll claim our spot next to the top 3

I understand this is the case. It’s not DF’s fault that people staked and chose not change the default followee setting. I also understand they can make this change any time and that’s the beauty of liquid democracy. 

AFAIK Amazon customers that run their ETH nodes on AWS are also making a conscious decision to do so and can change their mind if they want. 

Are these two situations really that different? I do believe that the IC can grow beyond this. That’s certainly not the case for AWS. I’m just asking about the state of the network today.

We can provide a way to allow users of Taggr backup their data, not modifying anything to II.

1. Taggr DAO rollout a new canister, integrated with Connect2IC, and set "customDomain" to their old frontend url to "Astrox" instance
2. Users use AstroX ME to link device to II (experimental)
3. Users login to new Taggr DAO frontend, sign-in with ME and their linked II anchor.

What approach does this refer to? Can you elaborate on the details please? What people were suggesting that could have been started, I mean.

-------------------------

christian | 2023-04-01 09:10:07 UTC | #243

What could be done quickly is 

- spinning up a new canister,
- load backups,
- re-link domains to it,
- migrate largest tokens holders manually from II to the already supported seed phrase login.

This was possible, but then there would be no way to prove that the backup was not mutated, principals not changed, all token balances stayed untouched.

While the tokens were not tradable yet and the original canister id is not used on any DEXes, it is not about a recovery of a monetary value but resolving an ideological dilemma and exposing the gaps.

For example, if the centralized recovery (without cryptographic verifiability of the canister state integrity) is the only way IC supports, no token will ever be worth much as it only a question of time when the next technical problem occurres and all you can is pray that your token balances won't be affected.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-04-01 09:14:11 UTC | #244

Basically, there's two options and things falling under those options determine whether it is decentralized or centralized:

1) a NNS decentralized proposal to make a change which would result in the 100% recovery, or
2) a centralized decision by a few people resulting in < 100% recovery

If you want specific examples, the II migration solutions proposed by several people would be akin to a fork with < 100% recovery and that approach would have to be agreed on by only a few people but would affect all the Taggr users.

Depends on how the dapp does its backup. If you use a dedicated archive canister for the backup and the forked app reads its state from there then it is verifiable.

Those 2 situations are completely different. It's much more important for the node infrastructure to be decentralized than an onchain DAO because the nodes can block/override any action an onchain DAO tries to make. So the NNS can't really do anything that destroys the IC network because the node operators will just block it to protect the network they invested heavily in. If AWS wants to destroy ETH there's nothing anyone can do.

This would work if we block the upgrade and push the backup to the archive canister before. Otherwise, If we restore even from a slightly outdated backup, there’s no guarantee that no transactions happened in-between that caused important side-effects. If a canister holds gigabytes of data, this would be impractical. One could of course do this only for parts of the data, like the token ledger, but it sounds more like a workaround. 

Canister backups are anyway an open problem right now. One could imagine e.g. a way to provide the full canister state together with the certification of its hash. (It could be a separate list of principals in canister settings who would be allowed to do this) If we also could show the hash of the canister state on the dashboard (right now we only have the hash of the binary) one could at least make the publicity attest the restart by verifying the hash with the previously extracted certification.

It is intended to enable transparent canister configuration and updates in a secure and auditable way using scheduled actions so the public has enough time to evaluate the impact of risks of an upcoming change (yes, I am paraphrasing from their readme).  The LaunchTrail canister associated with each project is intended to be immutable and keep a public record about everything that changes.  The goal is verifiable history.  I haven't seen many people talk about this capability since SuperNova, but it strikes me as something that might have been really helpful for resolving the types of issues that this Taggr incident has revealed.  I'm curious if anyone remembers this LaunchTrail application and has considered how something like this could be useful.

Hmmm, I guess there is no way to verify the current state (heap) of the canister or what is currently stored in the stable storage.  I assume DFINITY has internal tools to know this though.  

I do think the NNS is the right move forward as this will be a good test case for when enterprise apps come to the network and they are able to be recovered.  These apps will also like the confidence that given the current voting power of the foundation that they can guarantee not to face any dilemmas the community might have about restoring it.

As promised, I provide the link to the source code of the fix: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/742d0a8399476a83878bb87c74eb46b2d8e05000 (cc @justmythoughts).

There will be a blessing proposal created today.

PS: Additionally to the social verification (DNS records, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TaggrNetwork/status/1640636079635087361)) we used logs from a node of the `mpubz` subnet and verified that the previous canister build was indeed deployed from [Taggr's repository](https://github.com/TaggrNetwork/taggr/) which was then also used by the Taggr team to [confirm the proposal](https://github.com/TaggrNetwork/taggr/blob/main/recovery.md) additionally. This proves that the motion proposal asking for extension of the controller list of Taggr's canister was confirmed by those who controlled the canister prior to the incident.
