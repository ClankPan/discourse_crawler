My team is handling an EXT fungible token canister and the cycles are quickly running out. It is consuming almost 7T cycles per day, which is 2-3x the amount consumed by other similar canisters. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to break down the cycle consumption of a canister to try to understand what is consuming the most amount of cycles?

We had a similar issue a while back that we solved, if you search the forum you should find a thread about it

@jonit is probably referring to this thread https://forum.dfinity.org/t/canister-burning-through-cycles/13813/, did you already take a look at that?

To save you some time:

I recommend calling `initCap` if you haven't already. This will initialize the CAP event service. If you don't do this your canister will trap when it attempts to report a transaction to CAP. Your canister will catch this error and try again, hundreds of times within a few seconds, and will continue this behavior until you either restart the canister or initialize the CAP service using the command I mentioned in the first sentence.
