Is it possible to send cycles to a canister that I do not own (3rd party canister)?

For example: OpenChat at one point I believe end of last year abruptly stopped working, turns out it ran out of cycles.

Would any random person be able to top up a canister, and if so, how?

The easiest way is through the NNS UI.

1. Go to the `NNS`, login.
2. `Canisters` > `Create or Link Canister`
3. `Link Canister to Account`, copy-paste a canister id.
3. Top up the Canister (`Add Cycles`).

Thanks, I actually meant in regards to an external canister I do not control. It seems: `dfx ledger top-up` did the trick

From within the network, i.e. if you already had cycles, you would call the `deposit_cycles` function of the management canister with the cycles attached.
