How does IC prevent transaction deduplication? In other blockchain systems "nonce" is used. I don't see an equivalent. What am I missing? Could someone point me to the relevant literature? Thanks in advance.

See the transaction deduplication section at https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/icrc1-standard#transaction-deduplication-

On a higher level regarding canister calls in general, the IC boundary node http interface supports a nonce value. In practice the HttpAgent from the @dfinity/agent npm library handles this under the hood, but it's primary use is to prevent replay attacks not deduplication.
