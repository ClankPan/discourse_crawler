`dfx canister status <canister-id>` doesn't seem to have it. Is this information even available?

Don't know if exists but `canister_status` according [docs](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-canister_status) does not return such an information.

> IC method `canister_status`
> 
> Indicates various information about the canister. It contains:
> 
> * The status of the canister. It could be one of `running` , `stopping` or `stopped` .
> * A SHA256 hash of the module installed on the canister. This is `null` if the canister is empty.
> * The controllers of the canister.
> * The memory size taken by the canister.
> * The cycle balance of the canister.
> 
> Only the controllers of the canister can request its status.

Its valuable function. maybe can manually  write a function to report last upgrade timestamp using rust code on a rust canister .
