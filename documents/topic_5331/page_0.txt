"dfx canister --network ic call" can only be called from root folder?

I believe so.

BTW: For doing `call` on your canisters, in place of using `dfx`, I'd recommend trying another tool `ic-repl`:

https://github.com/chenyan2002/ic-repl/releases

The benefit of that tool over `dfx` is that it has a REPL-like function that can remember the canisters that you want to work with, dynamically get their latest Candid spec, and do tab-based autocompletion for calling them.  It can also script those calls.  If you know the ID of any canister, it will let you call it (as well as know how to call it, assuming it was compiled via Motoko, or implements the feature that provides the Candid API on demand).
