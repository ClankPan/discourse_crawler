I have finished this locally and got error when uploading to the ic with error for exceeding cycle limit per message and at the same time someone else already uploaded so I didnâ€™t pursue further.
Though I got the latest version of sushi working unlike the one already uploaded ðŸ˜†

And for this error I am trying to work on a nodejs script that should help with uploading assets to an asset canister and would solve this issue

Here is the PR I submitted, it still needs a lot of improvements but it showcases that we are able to deploy the app with a minimum of effort.
