The ICRC-2 Fungible Token Standard has been live for almost a year.

ICP ledger also supports ICRC-2.

How many more years will it take for SNS tokens to support ICRC-2?

Why spend so much time discussing stuff you donâ€™t need?

Hi @curry.  ICRC-2 is supported in the ledger, but the upgrades need to be rolled out.  They are blocked on SNS-W work that needs to be done.  This work is up next for the NNS team.  I don't have a date for when it will be available yet.
