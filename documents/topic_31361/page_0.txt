Both the events hosted by ELNA brought together some of the brightest minds in blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and decentralized applications.

The conference, held on 11 March, ‘24 showcased the advancements in blockchain-integrated AI technologies. Participants had the unique opportunity to engage with developer experts from the IC ecosystem including Sonic and ELNA’s in-house devs, participate in hands-on hacking, and explore cutting-edge innovations driving the future of decentralized AI.

**Key Highlights:**

1. *Keynotes and workshops*: Renowned experts from the blockchain and AI communities delivered keynote addresses -

* Real World Applications of Decentralised AI by Kyle Langham [Director of Data and Analytics, Dfinity]
* Introduction to DeAI by Arun PM [Founder, ELNA.ai]
* Talk on ChainFusion by Renjith [Sr. Engineer, Sonic]
* Workshop on Internet Computer and DeAi by Alex and Mohit [Sr. Developers, ELNA.ai]
* Demo on Rust Bindings for Python (including intro to development with RUST) by Tom Victor [Sr. Engineer, ELNA.ai]

Highlighting the future of decentralized AI and its potential to transform industries.

2. *Hands-On Workshops*: Kickstarted end-to-end building and running of a dApp on IC. The DFINITY command-line execution environment (dfx) is the primary tool for creating, deploying, and managing the dApps one develops for the IC, taught by ELNA devs.

3. *Panel Discussions*: Explored pressing issues in the blockchain and AI space, including data privacy, transparency, and the evolution of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

4. *Asia's First DeAi Hackathon*: The highlight of the event, the DeAi Hackathon, saw teams competing to develop innovative solutions in decentralized AI applications that could leverage ELNA's on-chain prompt engine and vector database. The winning teams received significant prize money from ELNA, as well as the opportunity to further develop their projects through the chance to win grants from ELNA.ai. The top winner of the hackathon also received 5k USD as grant prize from Dfinity.org (subject to milestones achieved).
