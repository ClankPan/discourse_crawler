VOTING NO on this proposal before it passes. [Proposal: 115473 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/115473)   

The purpose of the proposal is to enable users to use Know Your Transaction (KYT) integration in the ckBTC minter.

The proposal mentioned above was poorly drafted and did not have extensive research and analysis on the downstream effects on the NNS with the constant evolvement on the IC community.  

By voting no users are setting a high bar on how decisions are implemented that would have a longterm effect on the NNS canister.  

The team making the proposal need to give a detailed clarity report to the general IC community on how they resolved issues raised on this thread.  [ckBTC and KYT Compliance](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-and-kyt-compliance/18754)
