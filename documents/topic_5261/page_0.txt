Hey, is it possible to fetch the candid file of a remote (running) canister A (different project) so I can import it somehow in my own motoko project and the appropriate actor for canister A will be generated with all the methods/types from the imported candid file in my project?

Thanks

You can either grab it from https://www.ic.rocks/ or call the [__get_candid_interface_tmp_hack](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/blob/a4dc06c2f35852a1a019a0b4650b901aeb547502/tools/ui/src/candid.ts#L70-L77) function yourself.

Feature request for dfx: a fetch/install command that downloads candid files for remote canisters and generates bindings.

Is using [__get_candid_interface_tmp_hack](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/blob/a4dc06c2f35852a1a019a0b4650b901aeb547502/tools/ui/src/candid.ts#L70-L77) still the recommended way to get the candid of a public canister?

At this point in time, yes...

Note this function is only there for Motoko-based canister; for Rust canister; this function won't be returned;

Unless [they choose to do so](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/d0babbab9e14b23bd7d626c01db04e0dfd45424e/src/internet_identity/src/main.rs#L608-L614).

The governance canister also does this:

Is there a way to get candid from a Rust canister?

-------------------------

Ori | 2022-02-21 13:13:32 UTC | #9

@Dustin To get the candid directly from the canister the rust canister developer currently has to provide a __get_candid_interface_tmp_hack method that serves the did file themselves. See the repo links in the last couple of posts above. (Motoko canisters do this by default.)

-------------------------

Dustin | 2022-02-21 13:27:10 UTC | #10

Thanks @Ori. Just to make sure I understand correctly: Motoko canisters by default have their did available via `__get_candid_interface_tmp_hack`. Rust canisters have to explicitly make it available via adding a `__get_candid_interface_tmp_hack`. So if the owner of a Rust canister doesn't declare the method, there is no way to get the candid directly from the canister?

-------------------------

Ori | 2022-02-21 15:26:20 UTC | #11

Correct. There are other ways for rust developers to provide the candid (see https://github.com/chenyan2002/ic-repl#notes-for-rust-canisters) but again they’d have to do this on their end.

At some point rust canisters could have this by default too, but there isn’t a direct binding for rust types so assumptions have to be made on how to map them. The didc command line tool [https://github.com/dfinity/candid/tree/master/tools/didc ](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/tree/master/tools/didc) now provides a binding this way though so it may be a step toward that default being enabled. @chenyan may have more info on this.

You could also check the canister directory here, where you can search by any canister id, did files are under the Canisters tab: [https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/)
It’ll pick up the candid as above alongside candid provided in listings, so rust devs can add candid manually to a listing here if they prefer.
