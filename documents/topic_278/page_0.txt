Greetings from Portugal!

This may be a forward thinking DEX example but bear with me..

If i create a canister with my bitcoin wallet and private key
I nest it somewhere with added cryptography
I create a function where if user X sends Y then send a transaction to Z

1. How secure is my private key?
2. Will dfinity be running cross-chain nodes for wallet integration?
3. Would this be the way to do it?

Hi coinatomy, Great you could join us! There arenâ€™t any details on working with private data in the canisters yet, nor solutions for talking with other chains. When things get further along you may find a clearer idea on how to approach something like this.
