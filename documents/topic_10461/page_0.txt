I have above a code snippet that provides this warning. But as you can see in the above check, I'm verifying that `transactionHistoryLength` is greater that 50, so the offending code section is safe.

Am I doing this wrong? Shouldn't the compiler be able to infer that this code is actually okay owing to the `if` check performed

@claudio any thoughts on this?

try:
```motoko
let temp: Nat = transactionHistoryLength - 50;

Thank you. That was it. Specifying the type inline also solved it

I wasn't even aware you could do something like this
