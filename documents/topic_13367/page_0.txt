Hello everyone,

Is there a way to run a Web Socket Server inside a canister? I would like to use a canister as signaling server to establish a WebRTC connection between two peers. For this I need each peer to be notified by the canister when the other peer sends an ICE candidate.

I guess there is a way to subscribe to a canister otherwise I don't see how messaging apps built on the IC could work (unless they keep polling for new messages which I don't think is best). Let me know if there are other approaches to solve this problem.

Thanks a lot in advance :)

I don't think that is currently possible, but there are other teams working on the same problem. See https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-island-collective-a-social-vr-canister-alpha-release/12387#notes-on-networking-2
You might want to connect with them.
