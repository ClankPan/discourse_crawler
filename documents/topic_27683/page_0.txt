When using @dfinity/auth-client@0.20.2 connect to ii in Safari browser, if the "Pop up Windows" option is turned off, there happened an error "Pop up window blocked". Is there a way to solve this problem?

Hi, 

1. Are you still experiencing the issue?
2. Is the issue occurring with specific applications or with any dApps on the IC?
3. Have you encountered the issue even after refreshing the page?
4. On which device are you facing the issue: macOS, iPad, or iPhone?
5. What is the version of the device?
6. Which version of Safari are you using?
7. Do you have any plugins installed in your browser?

To avoid popup blockers in most browsers, make sure to call the AuthClient login method on user interaction e.g. event handler of a button click. Most browsers will block popups that are created outside of user interaction e.g. immediately after opening a page or 2 sec after clicking a button.

I don't know why, I assumed OP was asking as a user, not from a developer perspective. That's good call. Thanks for the add-on!

Thanks for your answer. It's seems a async function before call the AuthClient login method would case this error. :smile:
