I'm eagerly awaiting the day I can host my static website on the IC. Going through 15-30 day old posts, they all say subnets will be available "in a couple days". Have there been any hiccups or is there a timeline when we can expect subnets to be available to the general public?

I think this is largely a matter of caution and operational stability to ensure the network can accommodate the demand. Stay tuned to the forum for further announcements.
