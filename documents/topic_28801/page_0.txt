The account 'DevKev' has been suspended from the dfinity forum for scam. Click on his profile. And he will try to attempt to get you to connect your metamask to the website. (livesupport.fesd.online/) DO NOT NAVIGATE TO THIS WEBSITE

His name is actually 'KevDev', well when he asked me to connect my metamask that was a red flag and then I looked at his profile. It was created 5 days ago and already suspended for scamming
