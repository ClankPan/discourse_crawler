If you want to integrate Internet Identity into your React project, I recommend using the [`ic-reactor`](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introduction-ic-reactor-react-for-react-developers/27930) library. It's a library I've been developing that is designed to simplify authentication and interaction with canisters on the Internet Computer platform. Here's a quick example to get you started:

### Installation

First, install `ic-reactor` by running:

```bash
npm install @ic-reactor/react
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @ic-reactor/react
```

### Example Usage

**Wrap your `App` component with the `AgentProvider`:**

```javascript
import { AgentProvider } from "@ic-reactor/react";
import App from './App';

const Root = () => (
  <AgentProvider withLocalEnv>
    <App />
  </AgentProvider>
);

export default Root;
```

**Use the `Login` component for handling authentication in your `App` component:**

```javascript
import { useAuth } from "@ic-reactor/react";

const Login: React.FC = () => {
  const {
    login,
    logout,
    loginLoading,
    loginError,
    identity,
    authenticating,
    authenticated,
  } = useAuth();

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {loginLoading && <div>Loading...</div>}
        {loginError ? <div>{JSON.stringify(loginError)}</div> : null}
        {identity && <div>{identity.getPrincipal().toText()}</div>}
      </div>
      {authenticated ? (
        <div className="flex flex-col align-center">
          <button onClick={() => logout()}>Logout</button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => login()} disabled={authenticating}>
            Login
          </button>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Login;
```

For a complete example, you can check out the [ic-reactor examples](https://github.com/B3Pay/ic-reactor/tree/main/examples). Additionally, detailed documentation is available [here](https://b3pay.github.io/ic-reactor/modules/react.html).
