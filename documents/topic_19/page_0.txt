Hello, I'm new to this forum, I'm not a developer and would like to apologize if my place is not on this forum, however I am strongly interested in ICP and I just wish I could access this interface via Ledger on PC.

I followed the tutorial that's on the Internet Computer website, but nothing.

In this case, on my gsm the app has installed but my goal is to be able to manage this application on pc via Ledger.

Could someone help me?

Hi. At this stage of development of the IC, is it possible to develop a smart contract application (not an app that is used on Android/IOS, rather using only a web page where the smart contract can run) that integrates stable coins? Maybe Btc/Eth. My idea is developing a lottery using the IC blockchain, and I will like to know If it is possible and if there are developers that can do it. Thanks

Hello, a content grant has been approved, and we received an email stating our KYC is approved, and the first tranche of the payment will be made as per the payment cycle.

Could you give us more information on what's the usual payment cycle? It helps us set up operations accordingly.

I am a developer I need to open a topic for help about a rejection error I receive in my canister code when i call the bitcoin methods. Can someone give me permissions to open topics in  dev section?

Basically I have tried from different canisters and i get same error. Rejection code 4. Canister stopping. It happens at the following code (also at get balance method). Any ideas? Any help please? I am stuck.

 const utxos =  await ic.call(managementCanister.bitcoin_get_utxos,
      {
          args: [
              {
                address,
                filter: Some({MinConfirmations:1}),
                network: {Testnet: null}
              }
          ],
          cycles: 10_000_000_000n
      }
      );

Hello All,

I come here because I cannot post on the IC naming discussion forum (not a dev i guess?).  So I would like to bring this up somewhere because of how vital it is.  Now im trying to be objective, but 3rd party projects are not equal.  There is a reason Dominic Williams uses "dom.icp" on his X account, and why half of the team does as well, as well as many pro ICP influencers.  It's because when you explain ICP to a layperson the easiest way (and we all know this) is to say "well you can host websites on it"  It's something that's readily understandable and will 100% be the only reason that ICP gains widespread adoption.

So on that note I"d like to bring the case of ICNS up to everyone.  The project was developed by Psychadelic, and gained quite a lot of traction, but then they ultimately reneged (i believe they just wanted to milk some free ICP and leave) and handed it over to a few devs who were apparently incapable of running it due to not enough ICP coming in (although I know that this is not the case).  With that being said, those devs simply dropped the project, and people who have .icp domains are no longer capable of renewing them, nor buying new ones.  

For those that don't know, there are 2 naming NFT's out there, they are the .ic crowd, and the .icp crowd.  And I understand dfinity's position that "well it's all 3rd party so let the market sort it out" however, there's one very important fact, and that's visibility and marketing of ICP.  If it's absolutely obvious to us all, that the entire upper level Dfinity team uses .icp on their X accounts, wants to be associated with .icp, and prefers it as a represenation of themselves within the icp ecosystem, then it's absolutely obvious to me which one represents ICP better, and that's the .icp naming system.

For this reason, and considering that ICNS (those who issue .icp domains) is completely abandoned, I believe that Dfinity should take over the ICNS project, and lead it themselves.  This will promote 1. A source of revenue, and 2. a safety net, because Dfinity's enemies won't use the failure of .icp as a very vibrat example of a absolute incompetence of the ICP team itself.

I strongly suggest that the dev and dfinity team doesn't just treat this as "just another 3rd party app" and instead take it over and manage it because it is 100% the flagship selling point of ICP itself.

If the common man, who currently hosts websites for small business for 200-300/year via godaddy (mcap of 15b) learns of $5/yr, there will be a VIOLENT influx of people into ICP for websites, and those common middle class folks will be putting 10s of thousands of liquidity into purchasing ICP.

Please, if you're reading this and you're on the Dfinity team, can you get this message over to someone who can make a decision on this?  I can't post in various categories apparently other than general, but this needs to 100% be addressed, and addressed fast. 

P.S.

Idea for a Dapp is a "wordpress" for .icp websites, so the common man with no programming knowledge can use that app to develop his websites seamlessly.  IMO that'll make ICP itself viral AF for all middle class working people who have smalltime websites and pay 100s of dollars per year for them.

Hello everyone, especially Definity team,

as a big supporter and investor of ICNS, I completely agree with Arthur2.
I think it is a great shame, especially at a time when ICP is becoming more widely known not only in the crypto community, that there is no working .icp naming system.

Could you please help us contact and wake up the developers of this project, or suggest other functional solutions.

Thnx and have a good new year!
