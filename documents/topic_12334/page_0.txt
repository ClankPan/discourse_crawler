I wanted to know, if we can host a html page inside a data canister only , not in asset canister ? 
Or can we host a canister as asset canister and motoko data canister both ? 

(could be a silly one , but i just wanted to confirm!!)

Yes, you could host an HTML page inside your own canister, and serve it using an `http_request` method.

The certified assets canister that comes with dfx is Just Another Canister, but I believe it comes with certification by default.
