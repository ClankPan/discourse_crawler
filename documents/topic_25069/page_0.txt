GOLDDAO | 2023-11-27 18:10:00 UTC | #1

**A New Era in Blockchain-Backed Gold Assets**

Gold DAO embarks on a transformative journey, blending the security of physical gold with the innovative capabilities of blockchain technology, leveraging the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This integration is pivotal for expanding the utility of ICP and introducing a stable asset class in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

**Tokenomics : Diverse and Strategic**

Gold DAO's ecosystem encompasses multiple tokens, each tailored to serve distinct roles:

* GLD NFT : Direct ownership of physical gold stored in Swiss vaults, offering tangible investment and redeemability.
  1. Expert Insight : Each NFT is backed by a specific gold bar, with serial numbers and purity details transparently recorded on the blockchain.
  2. Redeemability Factor: Holders can redeem physical gold, bridging digital and tangible assets seamlessly.

* GLDT : A fungible cross-chain token that can act as a medium of exchange. It fractionalizes gold ownership and acts as a stable collateral for DeFi.
  1. Cross-Chain Utility: Ensures liquidity across multiple blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its appeal to a broader investor base.
  2. Collateral Efficiency: Offers a robust collateral framework for DeFi.

* USDG : A stablecoin backed by GLDT, providing a reliable alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins.
  1. Inflation Resistance: The value of the collateral of USDG, i.e. GLDT, is unaffected by the erosion of inflation.
  2. Financial Stability: The liquidity risk is lowered due to the price stability of the GLDT.

**Distribution and Allocation of GLDGov Tokens:**

* Total Supply: 1 billion, capped supply with a deflation mechanism.
* SNS Fundraising Contributors: 200 million tokens (20% of total supply) are opened to the community for voting power and staking rewards.
* Dev Team: 180 million tokens (18%), released over 24 months with a 3-month delay, aligning with the project's long-term success. Those funds are used for 2 years as incentives for the team.
* Treasury: 620 million tokens (62%), earmarked for strategic development, marketing, partnerships, and community incentives.The utilisation of these funds is subject to a vote from the SNS.

**Voting Power:**

Community will have 57.8% of voting power.

The remaining 42.2 % of voting power are assigned to the developer neurons hence the community will have the majority of voting power.

In the governance model of neurons within the system, a neuron must have at least 100 GLDGov tokens and a minimum dissolve delay of 3 months to vote. The maximum dissolve delay is 2 years. Neurons with longer dissolve delays receive a bonus multiplier up to 2, increasing linearly for delays between 3 months to 2 years.

Additionally, neurons accrue an age bonus multiplier from 1 to 1.5 for ages up to 2 years. For example, a neuron with a 2-year dissolve delay and 2-year age gets a multiplier of 3. This governance framework ensures a balanced and weighted voting structure, with the community owning more voting power than the developer team, promoting decentralized governance.

**Audit and Security of Gold Assets**

Gold DAO ensures rigorous security and transparency in managing its physical gold reserves:

* Regular Independent Audits: Conducted by renowned firms like KPMG and an independent Swiss Oracle to align physical gold holdings with issued GLD NFTs.
* Swiss Vault Storage: High-security storage for physical gold.
* Accessible Audit Reports: Providing complete transparency to token holders.

**Cross-Chain Functionality of GLDT**

GLDT's cross-chain design promises substantial benefits:

* Enhanced Market Access: Targets liquidity in Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.
* DeFi Portfolio Diversification: A stable, gold-backed asset for DeFi investors.

**Expansive Partner Ecosystem**

Gold DAO’s strength lies in its strategic partnerships:

* ORIGYN Foundation: Enhancing GLD NFT's security and transparency.
* YUMI Marketplace: Providing trading platforms and ensuring regulatory compliance.
* Metalor: Providing the highest quality of refined gold of 99.999%.

**Funding Role of SNS**

The Service Nervous System (SNS) is instrumental in funding:

* Project Development and Maintenance: Continual improvements and updates.
* Marketing Initiatives: Broadening Gold DAO’s reach.
* Operational Expenditures: Covering listings, audits, and other services.

**Conclusion**

Gold DAO is set to redefine the intersection of traditional asset classes and blockchain technology. It stands to significantly influence the ICP ecosystem and the DeFi sector, offering innovative, asset-backed digital financial solutions. We invite the Dfinity community's experts to engage deeply with our project and contribute to its evolution.

Simple question, regarding the term
 "Inflation Resistance"
GLDT, measured in USD, would have more and more value because it is a fraction of gold that does not devalue. USDG is devalued since it follows the dollar and the dollar has inflation? (stablecoin like usdt)

Theoretical example to understand:
Firstly, 2000 USDG is generated, which is equivalent to 1 GLDT.

After a while you need to have 2500 USDG to be equivalent to 1 GLDT?

-------------------------

monetaryTheorist | 2023-11-27 21:20:59 UTC | #3

Hi FranHefner, thank you for your question.
By inflation resistance, it means the collateral GLDT itself is protected from inflation. The USDG is pegged to USD and its value is subject to the erosion of inflation.
In the last two decades, USD has lost half of its purchasing power while the gold price has increased more than three times, which makes GLDT an inflation-resistant financial vehicle. 
For example, if a user holds some GLDT, he/she can pledge GLDT as a collateral and mint USDG for daily usage. In a few years, the user can pay back the USDG and redeem the GLDT back. Unlike USD-pegged stable coins, the gold-backed GLDT is inflation resistant.

real world assets on the blockchain powered seamlessly by ICP
cheers to the team for pulling this up for the community

-------------------------

integral_wizard | 2023-11-29 02:33:28 UTC | #5

This is beautiful in so many ways. 

- I would also like to see your plans to getting the USDG out into exchanges and wallets and into Crypto Twitter more broadly. I feel this is literally the best stablecoin in the world and I would presume people could use it on exchanges and self-custody wallets (like Ledger). In an interesting twist, this project could find some common ground between gold bugs and crypto people. Staying only on ICP would be underplaying the potential.

Very excited about this. We have had some good SNS launches but I feel to date, this tops the cake with immediate and totally unique value proposition.

God speed to all the critical partners in making this happen. :pray:

Hi, if I buy a GLD NFT and want to sell it after some time, who will buy it from me? Thanks.

-------------------------

Dustin | 2023-11-28 18:23:09 UTC | #7

Hi @Alkapone.ic, you can list it on the secondary market and anyone who is interested can purchase it, or you can sell it directly back to Yumi.

The blend of real gold and blockchain magic isn't just a cool idea – it's a game-changer. Gold DAO isn't just about making money digital; it's about making it smart and stable. And guess what? They want everyone to be a part of it. The fact that they're asking the Dfinity community to jump in and help out shows they're serious about making this a group effort.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-11-28 19:49:10 UTC | #9

Excited about this. Will definitely add the DAO SNS to 221Bravo App 😎

hokosugi | 2023-11-28 21:47:40 UTC | #10

Gold-backed stable coins have previously been launched as a product in Switzerland. What is the difference between this Gold Dao and [AgAu](https://agau.io/)?
Is Gold NFT ownership legally treated the same as physical gold? In Japan, purchases over 2,000,000 yen are required by the government to have a Certificate of Payment. Is KYC being implemented at Yumi to address these issues?
Also, GLDTs secured by Gold NFTs are supposed to be issued by the user who purchased them, but is there any plan for Gold DAO to take the initiative to issue them in large quantities since the volume is small and there is no economy of scale?

-------------------------

monetaryTheorist | 2023-11-29 20:56:49 UTC | #11

Hello hokosugi, thank you for your questions. I noticed that the AgAu token you mentioned is not listed on CoinMarketCap. Instead, I found Tether Gold (XAUt) and Pax Gold (PAXG) listed, each with approximately a $500 million market cap.

There are significant differences between GLDT and XAUt/PAXG:
1. Gold Dao offers a superior proof of reserve due to the non-fungibility of the gold NFT. Each gold NFT corresponds to a specific gold bar with a unique serial number stored in the vault and audited by KPMG. Users can redeem a Gold NFT for the specific gold bar with the same serial number stored in the NFT at any time. This non-fungibility enhances security and prevents misuse of the gold bars. Tether Gold and Pax Gold only mint fungible tokens, making it impossible for users to verify one-to-one correspondence or prevent misuse of their gold reserves for other purposes.
2. Gold Dao provides a more practical payment token with GLDT, as each token is pegged to 0.01 gram of gold, making 1 GLDT approximately $0.66. In comparison, XAUt and PAXG are pegged to 1 ounce of gold, making each token around $2000. This difference in unit size makes XAUt and PAXG less practical for daily use, especially when making smaller transactions like buying a coffee for $4.80.
3. Gold Dao clearly distinguishes between the two utilities of gold: store of value by GLD NFT and payment token by GLDT, effectively allowing individuals to act as their own central banks. Users can always mint GLDT by swapping their GLD NFT and vice versa.  

To answer your other questions. Yes, KYC is implemented on Yumi. Yes, liquidity is very important for the massive adoption and will be provided on the major exchanges.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-11-29 22:42:02 UTC | #12

Thank you for your response. I have three more questions.

How exactly does a Gold NFT holder apply for a physical gold withdrawal? I imagine that it is not often that physical gold is actually exchanged, but it would be more reassuring to know a realistic and concrete process.

I read somewhere that you carry insurance in case of theft, etc. Who is the policyholder in this case? Who is the policyholder in this case, Gold DAO?

I understand that the Gold NFT is locked in a smart contract when converted to a phase 2 or 3 token. If those Gold NFT are stolen, what happens to the exchange for physical gold? The exchange will be suspended, what is the compensation? Will this be decided democratically by the Gold DAO?

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-11-29 23:09:59 UTC | #13

What  is the difference in price between buying gold directly and buying a GLD NFT?

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-11-29 23:14:58 UTC | #14

Presumably if all else fails you can redeem the gold bar and sell it at the nearest bank - if you can carry it. ;-)

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-11-30 01:03:11 UTC | #15

If you can exchange a GLD NFT for a real gold bar, wouldn't the price be the same?

-------------------------

VictorG | 2023-11-30 10:53:41 UTC | #16

Hi hokosugi ,
Gold NFT holders can apply on this link to withdrawal for physical gold
www.bas.tech

The process is 1) fulfill information template 2) ID verification 3)receive quote and accept or not  4) paiement 5) receive the gold.
The price can be high , in general its not interesting for small weight.

The policyholder is Bochsler Assets & Securities 

Knowing its fully on blockchain it's mainly impossible to stole an NFT except if you share your seed phrase or if your wallet is no more secure. But even if that happen the ID is verified before exchange for physical gold. So if the ID is not correct , there is no exchange. But you are responsible to keep your wallet safe.

Hope that's help !

-------------------------

VictorG | 2023-11-30 10:57:13 UTC | #17

you need to add the cost to redeem it . It can be different depending of your country , time , weight etc

-------------------------

VictorG | 2023-11-30 11:05:48 UTC | #18

The main differences for me are : 
1) the price , GLD NFT offer a very competitive price comparing to the market. You can compare with other seller of gold bars.
 2) The gold bars are already insured and stored . You don't have to spend time and money to take care about it
3) The gold come from METALOR with the best production and quality standard.
4) you can buy it and sell it directly from your computer, you don't need to go to a store 

There are also a lot of other advantages . You can read the white paper available on yumi if you want more details 🙂

Happy to help if needed 😊

I think the speed of adding gold and removing gold from the treasury is going to affect the price greatly. Correct me if I am wrong. 
When there is more demand, GLD's price will be higher and someone will be incentivized to add real gold bars and then sell them to realize profit.
When gold prices are going down quickly, fewer will want to buy it and its price should be lower than the gold price. Then someone is incentivized to withdraw bars from the treasury and sell them to realize profit.
In non-volatile markets, all will be relatively okay.
So how long does it take to add and remove gold bars? 10, 20 days? Perhaps there will be traders who can do it faster? Or someone will be trading options to sync the prices more? Otherwise, the price of GLD will be the predicted price of gold after 20 days + fees + security risks.

The equation becomes pretty interesting when someone tries to create GLD stable coin with liquity algorithm or leverage trading contract. Then small delay/speed up in how the organization adds and removes from the gold treasury will probably get orders liquidated. Also, if a trader is 'whitelisted' and allowed to deposit/withdraw faster than others, that will disincentivise more traders doing it too and will allow that one trader to control the price.
I think, if I want to invest in gold long-term through the IC, the best option is buying the NFTs unless GLD price is lower and gives me a better offer. If I want to send a friend a few $ in GLD tokens, then GLD makes more sense. 
Just some thoughts and fears. Feel free to explain where I may be wrong.

Hi ICP fam, the details about the SNS sale can be found in the sns_init.yaml file on [the GoldDAO Github](https://github.com/GoldDAO/gldt-swap/blob/master/sns/config/sns_init.yaml). 
Also, this repository contains all code related to the GoldDAO project. Have a look and let us know if you have any remarks or questions.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-12-05 22:16:04 UTC | #24

One question.
Why ICP?
 Is there any reason why it should be ICP instead of issuing Gold NFT, GLDT, USDG on other chains?

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-12-06 00:50:41 UTC | #25

I think they needed Origyn NFT to authenticate the real world gold bars onchain.

-------------------------

Dustin | 2023-12-06 08:30:53 UTC | #26

There are many reasons, one being e.g. that ICP is the only one that allows us to put all data on-chain for a reasonable cost. The NFT runs on the Origyn Protocol which includes all certificates, audit reports etc about the gold bars, so it's essential that those can be stored for a reasonable cost. On top of that, ICP is one of the few chains who are actively working on cross-chain capabilities (see ETH integration) and we are planning to utilise this for bringing the tokens to other chains.
Have a look at [the whitepaper](https://gldt.org/Gold_DAO.pdf) where we describe a bit more about this.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-12-07 18:42:17 UTC | #27

I've confused what I do with my Gold NFT's... will I be "staking" or "swapping" them? Just clearing up terminology as I've seen both words used.
To me staking implies I will be paid or earn a yield on my Gold NFT and I will be paid in GLDT. Swapping implies to me that I will get a lump sum 100 GLDT per 1g of Gold NFT. 
Is there anywhere to make a yield on my GLDT or Gold NFT in the ecosystem or do I have to wait to mint USDG with my GLDT and then loan out my USDG to make a yield?

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-12-07 22:09:42 UTC | #28

Attaching interest such as GLD gov tokens to Gold NFT locked in a GLDT swap to the extent that they do not become liquid tokens would be effective in increasing the volume of GLDTs in circulation.

-------------------------

Dustin | 2023-12-08 10:39:17 UTC | #29

Regarding the terminology, Gold NFTs are "swapped" for GLDT. About the yields, there is no immediate yield just from swapping GLD NFT to GLDT. To encourage users to swap GLD NFT to GLDT, there will be a variety of incentives, including airdrops, like OGY and GLDGov. A sustainable form of income from the GLDT will come once products like USDG are built on top of it.

This is a really exciting project. As the project grows, wouldn't housing the physical gold as volume increases with a single vault provider in Switzerland create a risk of centralized point of failure? Are there any plans to decentralize and use multiple providers separated geographically to increase the decentralization of the custody of the physical gold itself?

Good morning!

I noticed that it seems as though a code review of the application is being requested, however there’s potentially a mix up in understanding, and financial audits are being provided instead. 

Does GOLD DAO have a development team auditing the code base of the application?

Thank you, God Bless🤝

fundlan | 2023-12-12 23:22:52 UTC | #38

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a type of organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. DAOs are often associated with blockchain technology, most commonly the Ethereum blockchain.

Key elements of DAOs include:

1. **Smart Contracts:** DAOs operate through smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts are stored on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
2. **Voting Mechanisms:** DAO members typically have voting power proportionate to their stake in the organization. Decisions, such as fund allocations or protocol changes, are made through voting.
3. **Tokenization:** DAOs often involve tokens representing ownership or voting rights within the organization. These tokens are usually tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Gold DAO (Hypothetical Concept):

A "Gold DAO" could imply a DAO that is somehow linked to gold or assets. Here's a hypothetical scenario:

1. **Asset-Backed Tokens:** The DAO might issue tokens backed by physical gold reserves or a gold-backed stablecoin. Each token could represent ownership of a portion of the gold held by the DAO.
2. **Governance:** DAO members could use their tokens to participate in governance decisions, such as determining how the gold reserves are managed, whether to acquire more gold, or other strategic decisions.
3. **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts could be used to automate various processes, such as distributing profits, voting on proposals, or managing the redemption of gold-backed tokens.
4. **Transparency:** The blockchain nature of DAOs ensures transparency, allowing members to verify the gold reserves and the DAO's activities on the blockchain.
5. **Decentralization:** The decentralized nature of the DAO means that decisions are made collectively by its members, reducing the need for central authorities.
Risks and Challenges:
While the concept of a Gold DAO sounds promising, it's essential to consider potential risks and challenges, including regulatory compliance, security concerns, and the stability of the underlying asset (gold). Additionally, developments and new projects emerge frequently in the blockchain space, so it's crucial to research and verify the specifics of any project claiming to be a "Gold DAO."

-------------------------

Esty | 2023-12-13 04:39:31 UTC | #39

I have two questions:
1. Can you elucidate on your vision of a sufficient liquidity environment for the project after the launch?
2. Can you share any information on the team and advisors behind the project, their domain focus and previous experience? Will there be a foundation associated with the Gold Dao project after SNS launch which contributes to the project, similar to how DFINITY does for the IC?

 I know some of this may have been discussed on x.com however I think as SNS sale approaches it would be helpful to add it here for the developer community to see who may not be active on that platform. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

Congratulations @GOLDDAO for exceeding the minimum commitment goal and tapping into the Neuron's Fund for your SNS.

Hey @bjoernek is there a glitch in the NNS dApp display?  It appears that the commitment goal progress bar shows direct commitment only, not overall commitment.  Shouldn't it show both direct commitment and neuron's fund commitment?  The overall commitment is almost 2/3 to the maximum, but the progress bar shows only 1/3 of max commitment.  This could lead people to think they have plenty of time to make their commitments when in reality it could be close to the end.

Also, now that we have an S-shaped Neuron's Fund commitment curve, how can we tell where we are on that curve.  Is it maxed out already or still in the max slope region?  How can we tell?

![image|690x401](upload://j4jjymibTPdSkbYHACpTjaMVmRV.png)

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-12-14 02:24:58 UTC | #42

This is why we relaunched ours. The minimum and maximum targets relate purely to direct participation. The Neuron Fund amount is calculated according to how much $ICP is raised from direct participants according to the curve you mentioned. At the end of the sale, as long as the minimum direct participation target is reached (in this case, 200k) the Neuron Fund contributes the calculated amount.

Hope this helps.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-12-14 02:36:57 UTC | #43

I just ran a test and it appears that the neurons fund is still contributing about 0.9 ICP for every 1 ICP committed directly.  Hence, it seems like this SNS swap will likely end much sooner than one would think just by watching the progress bar.

Edit: It appears the neuron's fund will only contribute another 58,245.77 ICP.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-12-14 07:49:51 UTC | #44

Yes, correct within the new Matched Funding framework the minimum and maximum funding targets are specified with respect to the direct commitment only. Hence, only the direct commitment appears in the progress bar. The contribution by the Neurons' Fund is considered to be an add-on. 

The maximum possible commitment by the Neurons' Fund is displayed on left hand side of the UX, see below.

It's estimated there is between 200-250 times more paper 'gold' than physical above ground gold. If gold investors trade in even a small amount of their gold ETF or other paper derivatives for an equal value amount of gold backed NFTs or NFT backed GLDT tokens, this would create massive demand for physical gold and lead to massive price increases. Could wide spread adoption of gold backed NFTs and GLDT be the catalyst that brings gold up to its fair value?

Also, is a silver backed NFT with its own fungible token being considered as a future product?

-------------------------

keyleehoang | 2023-12-20 14:44:14 UTC | #46

* Dev Team: 180 million tokens (18%), released over 24 months with a 3-month delay, aligning with the project’s long-term success. Those funds are used for 2 years as incentives for the team.

Why does the DEV group keep so much Gold DAO but only lock it for 24 months? What is the reason? Why not lock it for 5-7 years

-------------------------

Dustin | 2023-12-20 15:37:43 UTC | #47

The currently set maximal dissolve delay in the GoldDAO SNS is 2 years. So the team is locking up for the max duration at the moment. However, there are discussions ongoing to extend the max dissolve delay, similar to ICP (8 years) or ORIGYN (5 years) and respectively lock up team tokens for longer. This is also open for debate within the SNS after the SNS is complete.

-------------------------

timo | 2023-12-21 13:46:04 UTC | #48

To celebrate the imminent creation of GoldDAO we have already added the GLDT token to this open-source [ICRC-1 wallet](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcement-a-full-featured-open-source-icrc-1-wallet/23199) here: https://e4hv6-7yaaa-aaaao-a2ida-cai.icp0.io/

On the dashboard Reward Rate is disabled so you must be using some other mechanism to reward voters with OGY tokens instead of GLDGov, correct? How does that work?

edit: nevermind I misread the white paper. The rewards are in the form of GLDGov, but it's coming from the treasury instead of through typical SNS rewards, so the question of how it works still stands.

I have the same question @Dustin.  Do voting rewards for Gold DAO neurons earn maturity?  Is that maturity awarded in GLDGov tokens from the Gold DAO treasury when maturity is spawned into new neurons?

I sent a few gold dao to this new wallet and it shows no balance.

ICdex | 2023-12-28 12:21:32 UTC | #53

I participated in a total of 500ICP crowdfunding in the previous period, and also participated in the "GOLD DAO" crowdfunding at the end of the "launch pad". He was deducted 20ICP, a total of 520ICP, but only showed participation in 500ICP, and the 20ICP was lost. Is there a bug in the IC or is there a vulnerability elsewhere。

timo | 2023-12-29 16:24:39 UTC | #55

I added GLDT which is the upcoming fungible gold token. If you sent GLDGov then you have to add that token manually. To do so click on the big blue + button next to the search field while you are on the Assets tab. That takes you to the "Add asset" dialog. Click on the "Add asset manually" text. Then paste these canister ids:


```
Token contract address: tyyy3-4aaaa-aaaaq-aab7a-cai
Token index address: efv5g-kqaaa-aaaaq-aacaa-cai
```

I took those two canister ids from here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/tw2vt-hqaaa-aaaaq-aab6a-cai

Then click "Test" and some green text should appear. Then click "Save". Then you should see this in your asset list:

![Screenshot 2023-12-28 at 14.33.03|690x113](upload://iQTeWF00GVS2FPi201Z6RngosVP.png)

and it should pick up your balance, too.

UPDATE: GLDGov is now also a pre-configured asset that can be added simply by choosing it from a list. So the manual steps given above are no longer needed. Screenshot:

> Do voting rewards for Gold DAO neurons earn maturity? Is that maturity awarded in GLDGov tokens from the Gold DAO treasury when maturity is spawned into new neurons?

Hi @wpb @Archetypal , thanks for asking these questions. We are currently working out the details of the exact reward mechanism. As we didn't want an inflationary model for GLDGov, the direct rewards were deactivated. The rewards of each neuron will be proportional to the voting power which is public information that can be fetched for each neuron. We'll share details about this once it's more clearly defined.

Hello, I have a few inquiries:
@Dustin I would appreciate your attention to the below:

1. How will the 200 mil OGY tokens donated from Origyn foundation be custodied? How will the voting rewards from those tokens be awarded to holders of GLDGov holders as stated in the whitepaper?
2. SImilarly, how will the 80% of ICP tokens that were raised in the SNS sale, which Gold DAO has stated will be locked for 8 years upon a vote of the newly created DAO, be custodied? Since DAO's cannot directly control staked neurons (unless something has changed I am not aware of) how will this be custodied?

Thank you for your attention in these matters.

Dustin | 2024-01-08 08:11:03 UTC | #68

If you still can't see your funds, maybe someone from the dfinity team could help to trace what the problem could be? This is out of reach of the SNS initiator as we don't have more access than the public method described above. 
@lara maybe do you know what could be done?

-------------------------

Dustin | 2024-01-08 08:30:20 UTC | #69

Hi @Esty , thanks for the question.

1. **500mOGY** are given to the Gold DAO by the ORIGYN foundation. 100% of those OGY will be staked for 5yrs

* 33% of rewards will be directly distributed to GLDgov stakers
* 33% of rewards will go for listing and marketing 
* 34% will go to a treasury reserve for DAO participants to decide

- - - - - - - - - - 

2. 70% of the raised ICP in The Gold DAO will be staked, a proposition to be voted this month will look like this

* 10% ICP at 2yrs 
* 10% ICP at 3yrs
* 10% ICP at 4yrs
* Same till…. 8yrs -> total 70%

The rewards of the staked ICP will be distributed like this

* 33% will be directly distributed to GLDGov stakers 
* 33% will be used for listing support and marketing
* 33% will go to support team development
* 1% will go for humanitarian in contributing to « The Good DAO »

We will use a similar mechanism for the neuron as was done by [OpenChat](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat/tree/master/backend/canisters/neuron_controller). This let's the DAO control a canister that interacts with the NNS and holds a neuron. It's a solution that lets the SNS fully control the neuron. We are working on this now and will release it soon.

[/quote]
As a GoldGov token holder, how will I receive these rewards? I hold my GoldGov tokens in the NNS, as they were automatically created when I participated in the GoldDao SNS. However OGY tokens can currently not be custotied in the NNS, so how will OGY rewards be transferred to GoldGov token holders.
Similar question for the 33% of the staked ICP rewards: will GoldGov token holders automatically get ICP neurons created for them, in which the ICP staking rewards will be transferred?

-------------------------

Dustin | 2024-01-10 17:06:43 UTC | #75

Hi @ic.aitubi, thanks for the question.
For the ICP rewards, Gold DAO governance participants will automatically receive the ICP rewards on a periodic basis. The idea here is that ICP maturity will be turned into ICP periodically and then dispersed to the different stakeholders.
For the OGY rewards, we are in contact with DFINITY to see if it's possible to get OGY also included in the NNS frontend. We hope to find a solution here soon.

@Dustin Any Chance you are aware why you can’t merge the Golddao Neurons?

I currently have a few due to the staggering of them, would like to merge them all in to one 2 year neuron

-------------------------

Dustin | 2024-01-12 08:58:57 UTC | #77

As far as I know, it’s currently not possible to merge SNS neurons. I don't know why this is not possible. @lara do you have more information about this maybe?

The closest way that you can get is to extend the dissolve delay of all your neurons to 2 years and let all of them follow one of your own neurons and then use this neuron as your main neuron to interact with. It's basically the same as this neuron having all the voting power.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-01-12 13:23:36 UTC | #78

That's right. It is currently not possible to merge SNS neurons. 
The main reason is that this was added to the NNS after the SNS code split from it, but hasn't been added to the SNS code.
I also provided a bit more context why this is not on our immediate roadmap [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/add-a-merge-neuron-s-function-on-snss/25967/3).

Hey @Dustin will it be required to vote on proposals in order to earn rewards?  The vote history of each Gold DAO neuron is not public information.  In fact, that information is not even visible to the neuron owner after the proposal is settled.  Hence, I assume rewards won't be contingent on voting since there is no way to know who voted and who did not vote.  Is that correct?

Hi @Dustin, these are very good questions from @wpb, for me it will be also interesting to see which Account/Principal receives the ICP/OGY rewards as linking to Principal doesn't seem to be (easily) visible from the GLDGov Neuron stats and I'm not sure if/how will be the tokens accessible if are sent to the GLDGov Neuron directly, example GLDGov Neuron `330e853087d6ea204d2e558fc6a2f5d4ae3eb14e174c4c85bdf77905e3298102`:

Yes, your were right with your statements. We've activated a small amount of rewards (0.1%). This will let neurons accumulate maturity that is used as a basis for the reward distribution of the staking rewards in ICP/OGY. Contrary to NNS neurons, SNS neurons have all information public including maturity which let's us provide this mechanism.

Yes, ICRC1 accounts are based on principal (owner) and subaccount. So ICP can be sent to a principal. We will provide a tool that let's you specify your reward address, more on this will come soon.

Hi Dustin, follow up question. In the NNS wallet where I hold my locked GLDGov tokens (neurons) it says: "Hotkeys: In order to use this neuron to vote ... you have to add your personal dapp ID as a hotkey. Please refer to the instructions given by the corresponding dapp." However if I use the "Add Hotkey" function there, copy my Principal ID in the required field, click "Confirm", it is not accepted or stored. Could you help resolve this?

-------------------------

Dustin | 2024-02-07 15:56:47 UTC | #86

Hi @ic.aitubi , in general you should be able to add any principal as a hotkey there. I just tested with one of mine and I could add another principal. 

What exactly are you trying to do? Is there an error message popping up that gives more info?

Dustin | 2024-03-20 13:05:17 UTC | #91

Hi @plsak , the plan is to start dissolving some time in this year. However, this is also subject to go through SNS voting as all management of those neurons is now in the hand of the SNS.

Hi Gold DAO, it's exciting to see your known neuron proposal! As it doesn't appear to have been mentioned yet on the forum, are you able to share your motivations for registering a known neuron and what your voting principles are?

-------------------------

Dustin | 2024-08-07 08:06:17 UTC | #100

Hi @Lorimer , thank you for reaching out!

[This proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131666) wasn't sent by us but by some community member (maybe @krzysztofzelazko if I interpret the proposer neuron correctly?) who is trying to foster decentralisation on the NNS governance. We've checked the proposal and it is indeed correctly pointing to our 8 year neuron which is being followed by our other neurons, so essentially getting the full voting power of roughly 550k ICP in control of the Gold DAO.

Interestingly, we've been planning to become a named neuron as the Gold DAO as well and this may just move this forward a bit. Since it is all technically correct, we will endorse this proposal.

We will start by mainly focusing on topics which are directly related to us. This means new developments for SNS governance (i.e. topics about `System Canister Management`), `Governance` and `SNS & Neurons' funds`. However, we'll also monitor the others and the general ethos is to vote in favour of Gold DAO's vision and roadmap.

Side note: as the registered neuron [7446549063176501841](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/7446549063176501841) is in control of the Gold DAO and it will be hard to vote with this one directly, we follow our manual neuron ([7577629725324745012](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/7577629725324745012)) to perform the active voting for now.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2024-08-07 12:52:45 UTC | #101

Yes, I proposed registering the Gold DAO neuron. If I understand correctly, the team neuron [7577629725324745012](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/7577629725324745012) is only a temporary solution, but ultimately it is the DAO neuron [7446549063176501841](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/7446549063176501841) that will vote directly to improve decentralization. Here, we can suggest the [solution implemented](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/jmod6-4iaaa-aaaaq-aadkq-cai/proposal/3) in WaterNeuron SNS.

[/quote]

If Gold DAO does end up implementing a voting strategy similar to WaterNeuron, then we can easily modify the vote relay canister linked below so anyone can create NNS / GoldDAO neuron pairs.  That way people can always follow their preferred NNS neuron on the SNS version of the proposal.  This can be set up for known neurons or for personal neurons.  Of course, CodeGov would offer a follow option to the Gold DAO community on this topic since we are intentional about active participation in technical proposal reviews for NNS proposals.

-------------------------

Dustin | 2024-08-08 09:46:04 UTC | #103

Yes, delegating the vote to the manual neuron is more a temporary solution until we have a strategy for voting via the SNS in place. Something like what WaterNeuron has done may make sense.
