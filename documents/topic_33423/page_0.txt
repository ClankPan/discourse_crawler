There is an OpenChat page where someone claiming to be from Dfinity is answering questions about Utopia.  That person's name is **Emilio**.  Was that person sent by Dfinity to answer questions about Utopia?  I thought those questions would've been answered on the forum so just wanted to confirm.

Troubling that he would choose a channel full of conspiracy theories about Dominic to answer those questions.  Real

If more details are needed then please let me know.  

Edit: Removed information that I could not confirm myself since the OpenChat discussion has been removed or hidden.  Also don't want to give anyone ammo to create FUD.

Why was this information posted in that OpenChat channel and not where all can see, like on this forum?

Would be interesting is someone is able to answer.

Hey @Agnostic,

Thank you for your post and for bringing this to my attention.

My name is Emilio, and I currently serve as Head of Global Adoption at DFINITY. You can learn more about my background here: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/emiliocanessa/).

I want to clarify that my primary role focuses on outreach and adoption programs, that is why I am not usually heavily involved in the discussions typically held in this forum.

Regarding the topic you mentioned, I understand there may have been some confusion. The discussion has been closed, and an official statement has been published by DFINITY, which you can find here: ( https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-statement-on-constructive-dialogue/33138 ).

I kindly request that we respect the closure of the previous discussion and refrain from reopening it in this context.

This forum is dedicated to developer-related topics, and I believe it's important to maintain that focus. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in keeping our discussions aligned with the forum's purpose.
