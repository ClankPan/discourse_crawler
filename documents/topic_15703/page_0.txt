I have problems deploying. It's a canister that is already running but i'm unable to update as deploying keeps failing. Seems to be a wallet issue and I'm unsure which wallet nor which principal i used to deploy that canister. My question is how do i check which principal id is running with a wallet. Everyone I've tried seem to have no wallet. I've switched identities but all seem to have no wallet. But the site is running. I'm stuck abit . Any help will be appreciated.

Error explanation:
This command requires a configured wallet, but the combination of identity 'hmwcx-gwrbg-7rscj-aihzk-ddqua-426xw-rg62j-tfhse-rdxxu-32bef-bqe' and network 'ic' has no wallet set.
How to resolve the error:
To use an identity with a configured wallet you can do one of the following:
- Run the command for a network where you have a wallet configured. To do so, add '--network <network name>' to your command.
- Switch to an identity that has a wallet configured using 'dfx identity use <identity name>'.
- Configure a wallet for this identity/network combination: 'dfx identity --network <network name> set-wallet <wallet id>'.

Thanks for your response. By canister name do you mean the ID?

-------------------------

h1teshtr1path1 | 2022-10-01 16:21:18 UTC | #4

you can check your canister name, from dfx.json or canister_ids.json file in root.

try this dfx `identity get-principal` to get your principal and check it maches the controller of the deployed canister. to check run `dfx canister --network ic status --all` in the your project. 
it they match check if the caniser has a wallet by `dfx  identity --network ic get-wallet`
you should het the wallet for your live project. if not you might have to make and deploy it.

Thank you. This is what i get when i run the second command: I followed all instructions in the error message but nothing works:

    Failed to call update function 'canister_status' regarding canister 'pw3wy-dyaaa-aaaan-qaa4q-cai'.
      Update call (without wallet) failed.
        The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 403 Forbidden, content type "application/cbor", content: Only controllers of canister pw3wy-dyaaa-aaaan-qaa4q-cai can call ic00 method canister_status
Error explanation:
Each canister has a set of controllers. Only those controllers have access to the canister's management functions (like install_code or stop_canister).
The principal you are using to call a management function is not part of the controllers.
How to resolve the error:
To make the management function call succeed, you have to make sure the principal that calls the function is a controller.
To see the current controllers of a canister, use the 'dfx canister (--network ic) info' command.
To figure out which principal is calling the management function, look at the command you entered:
    If you used '--wallet <wallet id>', then the wallet's principal (the '<wallet id>') is calling the function.
    If you used '--no-wallet' or none of the flags, then your own principal is calling the function. You can see your own principal by running 'dfx identity get-principal'.
To add a principal to the list of controllers, one of the existing controllers has to add the new principal. The base command to do this is 'dfx canister (--network ic) update-settings --add-controller <controller principal to add> <canister id/name or --all>'.
If your wallet is a controller, but not your own principal, then you have to make your wallet perform the call by adding '--wallet <your wallet id>' to the command (before the 'update-settings' subcommand).

it seems your principal isnt a controller, i checked it for you by running `dfx canister --network ic info pw3wy-dyaaa-aaaan-qaa4q-cai
Controllers: o3vsw-mqaaa-aaaan-qaa3a-cai
Module hash: 0xe0df779f65fe44893d8991bef0f9af442bff019b79ec756eface2b58beec236f`. which i believe is your wallet.you able to log in to it you can check by putting your wallet address followed by ic0.app `o3vsw-mqaaa-aaaan-qaa3a-cai.ic0.app`
i did this for the wallet above. and by running and it seems to be already deployed since it asked me authenticate. then by running `dfx canister --network ic info o3vsw-mqaaa-aaaan-qaa3a-cai

i got to know the controller of the wallet which is

[/quote]

you. 

its a simple fix just use your wallet to add your principal as a controller.

-------------------------

valiantlynx | 2022-10-02 13:32:10 UTC | #10

you can add your principal as a controller by running `dfx wallet --network ic add-controller <your principal>`

you get your principal by `dfx identity get-principal`.

this should fix your issues

this one.
To make sure run `dfx identity get-principal` in your project then use that for `dfx wallet --network ic add-controller hmwcx-gwrbg-7rscj-aihzk-ddqua-426xw-rg62j-tfhse-rdxxu-32bef-bqe`

after this deploying should work.

Careful, it looks like you are confusing identity **name** and its **principal**. `dfx identity list` shows the available identity **names** whereas `dfx identity get-principal` shows the currently selected identity's **principal**. The error messages usually refer to the identity name, not the identity principal

ah i see. the problem is you are using the wrong identity to make the calls. you need to use the identity that controlls the wallet which is `hmwcx-gwrbg-7rscj-aihzk-ddqua-426xw-rg62j-tfhse-rdxxu-32bef-bqe`. ishowed how to check before.

this command should list all the identities u have
```
dfx identity list
dfx identity --network ic list
```
check for both local and live.

That's pretty bad. Did you ever try to manually edit this file? Dfx should never leave this file in a broken state. Right now, I think you would have to go in and fix this file manually. It has the following structure:

```
{
  "identities": {
    "<identity name>": {
      "<network name>": "<wallet id>"
    }
  }
}
```

So for your case that would be
```
{
  "identities": {
    "default": {
      "ic": "o3vsw-mqaaa-aaaan-qaa3a-cai"
    }
  }
}
