**Konectª Protocol** is a new protocol designed to streamline your digital life. It gathers notifications and events from all your apps implementing it, and compiles them into a user-specific canister, simplifying organization like never before. Any Web2 or Web3 app can use Konecta. Plus, with a strong commitment to privacy, these events remain confidential and accessible only with the user’s consent.

 **Konectª web app** Is the first application and use-case of the protocol and along with the protocol, it will form a Konecta DAO. The application connects service providers with their potential users through a calendar and will allow users to request any type of live service they want, from a Chinese class to a coaching session and much more, users just need to ask for it. ask and it will be given to you.

**Web3 advantages**

Unlike Web2 solutions, Konectª will be decentralized and give users full control over their data. It will not be tied to a specific platform or company, and it respects user privacy by design.


**Key Features**

1. Unified Event Notifications: Konecta collects event and event notifications from all your apps implementing the protocol, and compiles them into a user-specific canister. This means you can have and view all your notifications in one place, rather than having to check each app individually.
2. Privacy-Focused: Your events are private and no one else can access them without your consent. This ensures your data is secure and confidential.
3. App Integration: Konecta will be compatible with a wide range of web2 and web3 apps. This means you can manage notifications from all these apps and between these apps through Konecta.
4. User-Specific Canisters: Each user has their own canister where their event notifications and events are stored. This allows for personalized event management.
5. Easy Organization: With all your events in one place, it’s easier to stay organized. You can easily see all your upcoming events and never miss an important one.


**How is it built**

Konectª Protocol is developed using Motoko, it will be 100% Open Source, and it runs in multiple canisters as detailed below.


**The architecture works as follows:**

* Index canister: Maps Principals, users and user canisters.
* Event canister: Manage event detailed data to be able to retrieve event data fast from the protocol.
* User canister: Store user events and related data.

ICP made Konectª possible by providing a secure, scalable, and decentralized platform for building and deploying applications, where any user can have their own user canister to store their events securely and keep their privacy.

**Status of the project**

Konectª has completed its alpha-testing phase and is currently in beta testing. It is already developing KonectA WebApp which is a content creator social distribution platform.

Now that we’re completing our first Grant, we have plans to go live with Konecta Protocol and Konecta WebApp in a couple of weeks, as well as onboarding other apps to integrate the protocol.
