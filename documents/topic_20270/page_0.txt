I am failing whilst deploying my project local.

I have the following information:
dfx build did work

 dfx canister status --all
Canister status call result for iclottotest_backend.

the errors (whilst using different identity):

  Failed during wasm installation call: The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai trapped explicitly: RTS error: blob_of_principal: principal too short"


what do I need to do for solving it?

Thanks in advance

`dfx canister status --all` works, so the identity you're currently using (`dfx identity whoami`) is a controller of your canisters. `dfx canister install --identity default --all` fails because the identity `default` is not a controller (see error message). 

The RTS error sounds weird. What are your install arguments? It seems to come from here: https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/master/rts/motoko-rts/src/principal_id.rs#L269


Side note: if you use the anonymous identity to control your canisters anybody can hijack them

It's solved. Was an easy one. As a beginner in Motoko, I didnt know that you can't have multiple actors in the same canister (project/backend). It has to be a 1-1 relationship. Having multiple Motoko files in the same canister only 1 actor in main.mo is allowed. The other .mo files should be modules of the actor in main.mo

I hope this description fits.

I know the issue is already resolved, but just in case someone has the same error, here I found another cause. There may be other solutions for this specific case of course, but that one occurred to me and since it worked and does not represent any danger I left it :D.
