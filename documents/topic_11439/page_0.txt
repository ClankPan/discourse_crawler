Hi all - beginner coder and ICP enthusiast here just trying to learn how to code with dfx and manage a neuron via the command line. I'm trying to get my laptop set up with Quill but running into an issue after following the build instructions on the [Github page](https://github.com/dfinity/quill). I'm using a Macbook M1 processor and have Rust, Homebrew, DFX, and other software already installed on the computer. However, when I try to open Quill in Terminal I get the following error:

Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/quill
  Reason: tried: '/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libssl.1.1.dylib' (no such file)

I also tried following the instructions on [this page](https://pavcreations.com/dyld-library-not-loaded-libssl-1-1-dylib-fix-on-macos/) to no avail.

I realize this may be a novice mistake, but can anyone help point me in the right direction? Appreciate anybody that can chime in !!
