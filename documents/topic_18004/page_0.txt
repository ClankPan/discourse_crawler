I'm trying to add an ICRC token canister to an existing project that has other canisters.

I added the token canister to dfx.json, installed mops, and on deploy of the ICRC token canister, I get


```
   dfx deploy icrc_token

Deploying: icrc_token
All canisters have already been created.
Building canisters...
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.

/Users/black/icp/b/icrc1/src/ICRC1/lib.mo:16.1-16.40: import error [M0010], package "StableTrieMap" not defined
```


This is Main.mo in src/icrc_token in my project's repo (I just pasted it verbatim for now): https://github.com/NatLabs/icrc1/blob/main/example/icrc1/main.mo

The error arises here: https://github.com/NatLabs/icrc1/blob/c9ff6c64ee1531f33bf3d4d43bcbbbed271008af/src/ICRC1/lib.mo#L16

It seems to be a problem with mops. It's not installing the packages.

This is my mops.toml


```
[dependencies]
base = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base#moc-0.7.4"
array = "https://github.com/aviate-labs/array.mo#v0.2.0"
StableTrieMap = "https://github.com/NatLabs/StableTrieMap#main"
StableBuffer = "https://github.com/canscale/StableBuffer#v0.2.0"
xtended-numbers = "0.1.1"
itertools = "0.1.1"

[package]
name = "icrc1"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
repository = ""
```

and yet on deploy I get


```
Stdout:

Stderr:

@blabagastered what happens when you run `mops install` in your project

-------------------------

It seems there was something to it because I have two repos now. The main one, that includes the ICRC token canister and others, and a separate one that is only the ICRC token.

They had gotten muddled up and when I ran `mops install` in the main one, it did install things. The other one had everything installed.

That allowed deployment of some of the canisters, but not of the ICRC token canister in the main repo. I got this error log:


```

The ICRC-only repo says just:

Found the problem:

Part of it was that `mops install` hadn't been run. There's no explicit instruction to do it here https://github.com/NatLabs/icrc1#getting-started nor in the mops instructions themselves: https://j4mwm-bqaaa-aaaam-qajbq-cai.ic0.app/docs/install, so I didn't do it.

And part of it was that in trying to fix this file/line https://github.com/NatLabs/icrc1/blob/c9ff6c64ee1531f33bf3d4d43bcbbbed271008af/src/ICRC1/lib.mo#L16 I saved the file, and the auto-formatting-on-save tool I have (not sure which) broke the file on save.

I re-pasted the original lib.mo, saved it without formatting, and it now worked.
