Hi,

On my NNS the ICP to Cycles conversion showed the following number

![image|690x422](upload://cYi6okN18Yhu8UwoZTYOzLMm92Q.png)

However after i created a wallet on the console command with the same amount of 0.0798 ICPs, I get allocated a much smaller number of cycles.

Once the wallet is created and I check its cycle balance, i can see an amount much lesser

**dfx wallet --network ic balance**
737039322235 cycles.

Is my understanding correct or is there another explanation for this? This is considering I lose 1T cycles during the creation of a canister as fee.

Yeah that's right - it does refer to that in the image you posted (inclusive of a 1T cycles fee).
