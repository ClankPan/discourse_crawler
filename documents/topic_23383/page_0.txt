Is there a more efficient (and concise) way to convert a canister's principal to actor than `actor(Principal.toText(canisterId))`?

Unless you can import it or receive it as an argument of the appropriate actor type, no, not that I can think of.

`actor(canisterId)` _should_ work for `canisterId: Principal`.

Conceptually, there is no reason to first convert it to text.

Consider the above as a feature request.

True, but the historical reason for this is that this construct was, I believe, used internally to bind a canister imported by textual id to its translated Motoko type, IIRC, and then exposed as  a documented language feature.
