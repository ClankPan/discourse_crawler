Just throwing this out there, but I think it might be good to have a thread focused on **marketing** the Internet Computer.

This doesn't seem to be a strength of Dfinity right now, and maybe some creative ideas could help from the community that wants to see this succeed.

If you have well thought out and realistic ideas, please share your thoughts.

* Be as precise and clear as possible
* The less burden on Dfinity, the better
* Extra hearts for creativity

Probably not a bad idea for all of us to continue  sharing this with people and channels:

The biggest power of Internet Computer is the developer base we have, one idea I have is to use testimonials, videos, referrals of our existing community & create a huge word of mouth wave to create noise in the developer circles - both Web3.0 & Web2.0

I [wrote something on Taggr](https://taggr.top/#/post/2393) about CryptoMiso rankings a while ago. I don’t think they paint an accurate picture of how active projects are.

The good news is, there’s probably more activity that isn’t included and that seems like an opportunity.

The IC is world-wide, the developers, ICP holders, enthusiasts could benefit from “regional” meetups hosted in some of the major hubs/cities. 

I could see this building and strengthening bonds and new friendships centered around the IC. 

I see new ideas springing to life from the conversations, community/public awareness of the project increasing and life long friendships made…. Ideally the best spot for these regional meetups would be a “happy hour” at the local pub/bar. The bubbles in your drink really do help great minds collaborate on new ideas. 

In politics - I believe it’s called grassroots marketing.

Absolutely, @shruti. Here's one more post from reddit as an example.

"I have a Masters in CS with my entire history(1+ yr) on reddit based on ICP with ~1000 karma points. I also am a member of the 8year gang.

I thought it was simply cool to build on IC & I got to learn a new language(rust). There are aspects to IC that only an imaginative brain could bring into it.

 I would have never thought how AN APP built on top of IC (SNPR) will eventually replace XMR (Monero).

I would have never thought how ECSDA and Https Requests would help AN APP built on top of IC would let us replace LINK (idea is courtsey lastmjs on twitter).

Personally i dont think that banks and govts have a clue onto ICP. They are just too slow for the digital age"

Based on feedback I’ve seen with my involvement in other communities I would like to suggest that anyone organizing a meetup should consider choosing inclusive venues.

Bars and pubs prevent otherwise interested people of a certain age from attending. There are other reasons too, in my experience.

-------------------------

shruti | 2022-08-04 13:54:29 UTC | #9

I've attended a few meetups where it's usually an open bar venue , people just come and hang out and order their own drinks. 

Worth trying out for sure to rally the community! @DHemingway @mparikh if you guys are up for it we can try in our cities.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2022-08-04 14:07:49 UTC | #10

I think you are right with the inclusive venues, we wouldn't want age limit's to deter community participation. My reasoning behind a regional bar/pub community meetup was to bridge the language gap if there was any - from my past experiences with my colleagues that only speak Mandarin or Swiss/German and do not speak English very well and vice versa, the bubbles help bridge the language barrier and the bar napkins are perfect for drawing pictures to help communicate.

As a business leader in my community in the states, we utilize the Chamber of Commerce network in a similar fashion as a way to organize networking events or educational meetups for specific topics of interest (technology, healthcare, etc.).  Most regional chamber's are more than happy to publicize the event to the their business member communities and are open to the public as well and doesn't usually cost anything because it serves as a community benefit. I have not heard of anyone from the crypto community trying to utilize the chamber of commerce this way - but it could be a good idea to bring blockchain enthusiasts, the public and business leaders together.

ld-dfn1 | 2022-08-05 01:06:51 UTC | #12

Thanks @Jonathan for initiating this thread. It’s really great to see these incredible ideas coming from the community. This post also triggered me to share some of my own thoughts on where I see we stand today and how can we start incorporating some of these community ideas. 

As a quick background, I am the VP of Growth at DFINITY. My team is responsible for helping build our developer ecosystem, manage our grants program amongst other things. The notes below are just my opinion and I am using this as a way to seek more inputs from the community.

As a growth focused person, I always think of things in the form of flywheels. So my thought process has always been to create core growth flywheels for IC. 

Here is one core growth flywheel we are chasing right now:

1. Attract Entrepreneurs/Developers —> 
2. Help them become successful (technical support, grants/funding, UI/UX, PR, marketing, etc.) i.e. help them get to a point that they can build a vibrant user community around their product (and eventually becomes a self sustaining economy) —> 
3. Showcase their success stories (social, press, interviews, community) i.e help the teams attract more users and help IC attract more Entrepreneurs/Developers  —> 

(Back to step 1. Rinse and repeat)

**tl;dr - IC is going to be successful once the entrepreneurs/developers building on IC are successful in attracting/retaining users and created sustained economic activity.** 

Now to bootstrap this flywheel, we have to think of all the ways we can attract a critical mass of entrepreneurs/developers on IC. Hence, the first problem we as a community need to solve is how to drive “**Awareness + Interest**” around IC?

In my mind building “**Awareness + Interest**” is a function of the following things:

1: Helping find a true product market fit

2: Crafting the right message

3: Building channels to constantly deliver that message


**#1: Helping find a true product market fit:**

Ensuring that what we are building is solving a real pain point. In our case it involves constantly talking to developers and understanding “Why” they are here to build on IC. I wouldn’t talk too much about this topic as I believe lot of us understand this reasonably well.


**#2: Crafting the right message**: 

There have been constant iterations within the foundation around communicating the value proposition of IC more effectively. [Website](https://internetcomputer.org/), [documentation](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_wiki), [20 year roadmap](https://medium.com/dfinity/announcing-internet-computer-mainnet-and-a-20-year-roadmap-790e56cbe04a), [sample code](https://internetcomputer.org/samples) , [whitepapers](https://internetcomputer.org/whitepaper.pdf), [academic publications,](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/632.pdf) [infographics](https://internetcomputer.org/icig.pdf), [videos](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works), [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhDt1vhGcreT8T9Ox_h-rnY38ioUBh54), [community conversations](https://internetcomputer.org/live-sessions/), [Twitter spaces](https://twitter.com/dfinity/status/1501582572886929408?s=20&t=NnrqV1PhU2hrVw6Sa7hMfQ), et al. 

Now each of these are catered towards a slightly different set of audience personas but the underlying theme has always been to communicate the various aspects of the IC out in the world across a varied set of audience. Here is my personal assessment of where we stand (not necessarily the opinion of the foundation): 

- +ve: We have been constantly improving and now have a reasonable ability to constantly bring out foundational content available out in the open.
- Scope for improvement: Content does not mean solid messaging.

*Let’s zoom into what is the challenge here?* 

IC is very different from anything else out there ([alien tech](https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1421857807339606016?s=20&t=4ocwyjKCcWuSDK2Wnh3r6g)!) and it is reasonably non-trivial to explain it ELI5. After all as humans we make our mental models to describe anything new by finding a comparable. Now as a community we have all been making attempts. Few describe IC as a decentralized cloud, some others describe it by the things that have been made possible on IC, another few by focusing on speed like comparing TPS metrics across chains and some others describe it by the novel tech innovation it brings to the world. 

Note that there are no right or wrong answers here. Having said that we certainly need as much of a crystal clear messaging as possible to help scale. One thing is for sure, we need to focus more on [highlighting benefits vs. talking about features](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckswoboda/2020/05/12/features-versus-benefits-why-the-iphone-succeeded-and-google-glass-failed/?sh=2258dac53eea) (and I understand it is easier said than done but we need to continue iterating).

Lets take a couple of illustrative examples:

- When we talk about “Reverse Gas” (feature)…the benefit is that a user doesn’t need to have tokens in their wallet when they are liking/commenting on a socialFi app like Distrikt
- NFT’s are completely stored on chain (feature)… the benefit could be that you can now imagine the entire games or specific levels of games as an NFT and not just a simple jpeg.

To be honest, I have learnt about these benefits during conversations with different members in the community. We at the foundation are constanly learning about new and better ways to communicate. 

This is one area where I think the community can help. Let’s all iterate to refine the core messaging of IC. We need to highlight the key benefits lot more effectively… from http calls to tECDSA to BTC integration, etc. 

**# 3: Building channels to deliver the message:**

Now lets take a deeper dive into few of the channels and  where (I think) we stand today.

**- Word of Mouth:**
    - *+ve:* Lot of IC growth is organic. We are seeing a constant influx of entrepreneurs/developers and users experimenting with IC. Public repos, canisters are scaling well.
    - *Scope for improvement:*
        - Effective tooling to measure the word of mouth viral co-efficient.
        - More traction for IC ecosystem projects (more successful they are the stronger the word of mouth)
    - *Initiatives where the community can help:*
        - Build awesome products with viral features  (more users —> more attention to IC). The best way is to show (not tell) of what IC is capable of doing.
        - [Open for suggestions]

**- PR:**
    - *+ve:* TBH we need to improve a lot here
    - *Scope for improvement:*
        - Significantly better media relations (journalists who understand IC and can cover updates)
        - Crafting better messaging and PR pitches for core platform releases as well as ecosystem updates.
        - Data driven new story opportunities (media covers breaking news and not features)
    - *Initiatives where community can help*
        - Help craft better elevator pitches for ecosystem projects
        - Analyze public data (and possible compare with other ecosystems) to create media friendly articles
        - Thought leadership via guest posts in top media outlets
        - [Open for community suggestions]

**- Social + Content Marketing**
    - *+ve:*
        - Strong traction (and constantly growing) on owned channels - Reddit, Twitter, YT, CMC etc
        - Significantly reduced FUD on owned channels like r/dfinity, twitter, etc. (a huge round of applause for Diego and our community support team)
    - *Scope for improvement:*
        - We need to have a better representation in external communities (for instance, r/cryptocurrency, etc.)
    - *Initiatives where the community can help*
        - Help break into external communities with thoughtful arguments (not shilling without substance)
        - Help translate IC related content in multiple languages
        - [Open for community suggestions]
        
**- Partnerships:** 
Some additional background as it was suggested by community members on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DukakisTejada/status/1552765172057530368?s=20&t=6S0jf0ZEuNLeVabp8ADBsQ) thread. The foundation had multiple early level conversations with large brands, enterprises, consulting firms, etc. Getting access is not any challenge instead it is a matter of prioritizing based on the bandwidth we have available. Very much open to community inputs here.
    - *+ve:*
        - Key focus so far has been on financial exchanges where we have made some good traction.
    - *Scope for improvement:*
        - Prioritizing/resources
    - *Initiatives where the community can help*
        - Big Brands: Most brands are looking for solution partners and creative agencies/consulants before they think about the technology stack. The foundation has more R&D focus. We believe the community entrepreneurs are best positioned to recruit brands, top artists, etc. and bring them to the IC ecosystem.
        - [Open for community suggestions]
    
**- Events/Speaking Engagements**
    - *+ve:* TBH we have a lot to improve here. We are very early
    - *Scope for improvement:*
        - Effective filtering of events
        - Better planning, early outreach (resource have been a challenge)
    - *Initiatives where the community can help*
        - We need more and more people talking about IC at events
        - Help access to strong events
        - [Open for community suggestions]
        
**- Ambassador Programs**
    - *WIP (more details will be shared soon)*
    

My thoughts here are by no means comprehensive but treat them as where the current gaps are in my opinion. We can significantly accelerate the adoption of IC is by collaborating and filling the gaps. 

**What Next?**
I would propose the formation of working groups focused on these topics where we can brainstorm and make tangible progress towards these goals. Over the next couple of weeks we will map out things internally and reach back out with the next steps.

[/quote]

This is true to a degree, but it is also the case that the IC does not have good spokespersons. Look at how articulate Charles Hoskinson is, for instance, he speaks beautifully in a manner that anybody vaguely knowledgable about blockchain can understand, with no hemming and hawing. If I didn't know better, he would have convinced me that Cardano represents a true breakthrough.
Of course, these are not skills that can be entirely taught, natural talent plays a role, but Dfinity spokespersons don't even seem to have the ELI5 audience in mind when they address audiences or give interviews. They could overcome some of their defects as speakers if they really tried to make their message clear.
When I want to provide links that explain the IC's potential to acquaintances, I choose Olaf Carlson-Wee's interviews over anyone at Dfinity. He's lucid, eloquent, and doesn't get into the weeds of the tech which very few people are interested in. He sticks to the big picture and stresses what the IC can do that other networks cannot. He's a better promoter of the IC than anybody at Dfinity by a wide margin.
The first step to improving is acknowledging there is a need to improve. I am not sure if faces of Dfinity like Dominic Williams are there yet.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-05 09:09:17 UTC | #15

Agreed Dfinity needs someone to do what Hoshkinson did for Cardano or Antonopolous did for BTC. I have the background to understand Dom, but as you said a non technical person might be lost, plus some of the points Dom nakes in favour of ICP are barely expanded upon and don't quite convince me. 

I still haven't heard a rock solid explanation on why Blockchain Singularity is actually achievable and desirable for tech companies, he mentions tech stack being too complex and high costs for maintenance and security, things I don't believe ICP will completely solve.

> A recent *Harvard Business Review* [article](https://hbr.org/2019/02/why-great-innovation-needs-great-marketing) suggests that Google Glass could have been innovative, but that it suffered from a lack of effective marketing. To succeed at innovation, argues the author, “companies must put as much energy and investment into marketing new offerings as they do in generating them.”

I wonder... which organization or industry is in most immediate need of unhackable IC canisters? 🤔

-------------------------

senior.joinu | 2022-08-05 18:09:40 UTC | #18

This is maybe an unpopular opinion, but I believe the IC does not need any better marketing that it has now. Just implement what you've promised to implement (mainly, BTC integration), tell everyone about it as simple as possible, and the next bull run will make the magic happen.

The most good thing that you can do from marketing point of view, IMO, is to find ways of explaining the IC to non-technical people. 

I'm in no sense a marketing specialist, ignore me, if what I say feels wrong.

These are some of the things this thread is soliciting specific ideas for.

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-08-05 22:14:36 UTC | #20

Thanks for the feedback. In my view each person has a unique style of communicating and it's hard to agree if one style is better than another. For instance, I was personally driven to IC because I was influenced by Dom and the research talks on YT (as it convinced me that this project has real substance). For others it may be a completely different narrative (say something presented by Olaf or someone else). That's why we need a lot more voices in the community sharing the IC narrative. 

Again I am not saying we have nailed out the narrative fully yet but rather quite the opposite. We need to keep iterating. 

One perspective (as shared by @senior.joinu in the comments below) that I completely agree with is let our work do the talking. When people experience impressive use cases being built on IC (benefits) there may be less of a need to explain details about the protocol to the world.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-06 03:43:03 UTC | #21

This kind of proves my point. Of course you liked what you heard from Dom, so did I, that is why we are all here. I was interested enough in the tech to get over the delivery of the message, but also acutely aware that the message was being delivered in a way inaccessible to my friends less acquainted with or interested in blockchain.
One would expect the VP of Growth to understand this rather than going the relativistic route of, "Oh well, there is no consensus on which style is better". This is wrong. 
Style matters, knowing one's audience and addressing it accessibly matters a lot, and the Dfinity belief that its tech will necessarily win out is misguided. There are tens of thousands of very intelligent people working on blockchain, and every one of them that is not working on the IC could be working with a competitor. And very few are working on the IC because of its reputation as a scam. I met a guy the other day whose entry at June's ETH New York made it to the top ten. I mentioned ICP and he retorted that it was a complete scam. Only after I showed him a couple of comments VB had made in the past was he willing to take a deeper look. *This* is what you are dealing with even among people who are deeply into blockchain tech. Imagine what it is like among normies. Dfinity dug itself into a very deep ditch and depending purely on the tech to climb out is a huge risk.
To be considered a success, the IC will have to be used by a billion people, very few of whom care about tech. BTC integration is great, but the true promise and test of the IC is whether it can, as promised, build consumer-facing websites and social networks on the blockchain that can pay for themselves and suitably reward creators working on them.
Otherwise, the IC risks becoming a bit like that bonsai tree we see next to DW in his workspace.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-08-06 04:53:47 UTC | #22

I echo @Denis 's well articulated point. "Build it and they will come" is a very risky position to take.

Department of Growth at Dfinity stand seems to be that we will let the work speak for itself and then there will be little need to  explain the details about the protocol ...because it is too difficult to explain? Am I understanding this  correctly?

-------------------------

shruti | 2022-08-06 10:20:34 UTC | #23

- Legal, medical, identity documents 
- all defi applications where bridge hacks are happening 
- High value NFT storage (individuals owning canisters) 
- Music and any other creative licensing

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-08-06 18:51:25 UTC | #24

I sincerely apologize if I was not clear in my comments above. 

IC (as with nearly any product) appeals to different types of persona. Clearly the fact that one should understand the motivations of their audience and deliver an accessible message for each of the different persona's shouldn't even be a debate :slight_smile: 

Stating the obvious here but for any message to appeal to the audience it should solve for "What is in for me?". Lot of our communication so far has been targeted to attract builders to the platform. The fact that we are all here and the developer community is growing is an evidence that at least some of that style of communication is working. 

Can we do significantly better to attract the builder persona? Absolutely!
Should we focus a lot more on attracting non technical audience? Without a doubt!

All of us here in the community are constantly iterating. Not just the foundation (be on the lookout for multiple new initiatives in this direction) but we also have multiple independent community driven initiatives like https://medium.com/icp-league or https://www.dfinitycommunity.com/tag/icpsquad/ amongst many others. We clearly need to do a lot more.

[/quote]

To clarify, I am not at all suggesting build and they will come. That never happens and we all know that. Rather it's the classic story that one doesn't need to teach every person the internals of TCP/IP for using social media apps. The mass adoption comes from use cases (benefits).  

It is not going to be very easy to explain to any non technical person say how is BTC integration that uses tECDSA is better than a bridge. For the sake of clarity I am not suggesting that we shouldn't attempt to explain the messaging in an easier way. We absolutely need to iterate and we are doing that. Having said that, my personal hypothesis is that delivering use cases that appeal to everyday users and promoting that aggressively will play a large role in driving mass adoption.

Thanks for the feedback. I have tried to clarify in the comments below

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-08-06 22:16:51 UTC | #26

This is pretty superfluous. Crypto as a whole hasn’t been adopted and a few eth degens not joining us is not a big deal. If you notice the devs that get hooked on the IC a lot of them are from the web 2 world. The super fans that are technical are al from the web 2 world. ICPs game plan should not be to try to beg for degens it should be to find use cases In global commerce.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-06 23:57:48 UTC | #27

If we can't even onboard the crypto crowd how can we expect web 2 devs to come onto the IC? Do you think they'll try out every different L1 and decide on their own? Most likely they'll follow the market or do some research and find plenty of misinformed people telling them ICP is a scam. Better tech doesn't always win.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-08-07 00:50:19 UTC | #28

There is no need to say probably the data already shows web2 developers have been onboarding onto icp on their own slowly.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-07 00:55:33 UTC | #29

I'd argue data also shows the same for other chains, Web 3 is attracting lots of talent looking to make a profit. Now what we have to ask ourselves isn't whether devs are being onboarded on the IC or not, but how many are choosing IC over other chains. 

I'm not sure this data exist anywhere but if it did I'd bet IC wouldn't be in the top 5, most likely not even top 10.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-08-07 01:47:32 UTC | #30

I don’t think anyone is trying to argue that point. I’m saying that our marketing is doing fine based on the market conditions: I’m saying it’s superfluous to say icp is gonna die so early in the game. We don’t even have a token standard yet how do you all expect any start up to raise funds to build.

-------------------------

More than a justification this should be a red flag, how in the world after more than 1 year since genesis we still don't have a token standard?

Oversights like this are the exact reason we can't just rest on our laurels and blame poor public image on market conditions, FTX, Arkham ,etc...

Dfinity definitely can step up their game marketing wise, looking at Supernova's overall production quality or some of Dom's slides during presentations you wouldn't tell its something coming from a multi million dollar foundation with hundreds of employees. 

That being said marketing can only go so far when it comes from a corporation that has a poor reputation in its field, what Dfinity should focus on to improve its reputation is networking and getting partnerships with legitimate businesses. A "Matic" tier partnership would do more than any fancy tweet or video.

-------------------------

OVVOVVO | 2022-08-07 05:29:31 UTC | #32

Apple and Google take 15%-30% from app developers' gross.  From what I understand, they'd be free to develop whatever they like on the IC, with future SNS capability and tokenization of their dapp, and no one skimming profits off the top of their gross to allow them to operate.

That's seems like a massive selling point to me, to make loud clear to the web 2 world.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-08-07 10:47:23 UTC | #33

Apple and google are have mobile Eco systems icp is a web eco system. It doesn’t apply

It took Ethereum 2 years to recognize a token standard. R&D takes time.

This is along the lines of marketing to web 2 developers (even if it is currently a only web eco-system). Thanks!

Then by extension , an SNS project through an NNS vote, is an endorsement of the project by the IC community.

ETH was the first of its kind so its an unfair comparison, also was it 2 years worth of active RnD or 1.5 years of nothing and 6 months of actual work? It's a big difference.


We need stuff like this to happen to redeem the IC's brand and attract new devs/investors: https://twitter.com/iftikharpost/status/1556378640077946880

I know we can't have the specifics but is Dfinity actively working towards AAA partnerships?

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-10 03:13:27 UTC | #37

Some thing like this seems like a great opportunity to bring the IC's potential to a wider public:
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/27-year-old-bohemian-prince-raises-300000-in-nfts-to-preserve-and-share-castles-and-ancient-artifacts.html
TLDR: A Czech family owns castles, a huge art collection and historical documents that been returned to them after being seized by Nazis and then the communist regime. They cannot sell most of their possessions to fund their archival work because Czech law does not allow it. So, they are turning to NFTs as a way to monetise and archive the collection.
It would be the perfect project for the Dfinity Foundation to fund, with a continuous stream of publicity as each new batch of the collection comes online.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-11 01:25:49 UTC | #38

Exactly. Marketing and partnerships with trusted brands will go a long way to help the IC repair its reputation and build good rapport with the Crypto community and beyond.

Also what doesn't help is Dom starting useless arguments with other founders who are likely more connected and have deeper roots in the crypto community than the foundation.  He should try to make friends and collab when possible with other projects. Stop telling them the IC will make them obsolete. As the saying go you catch more bees with honey than vinegar.  

At this point, a PR firm is probably necessary because as proven the foundation strength is in r&d, not marketing.

Is dfinity seriously concerned about being turned away from the public due to marketing failures?

The ability to understand the public is essential, but dfinity did not take it into account due to the pride of being superior to others.

Most of the masses lack knowledge and are unwilling to change unless they are several times better than what they use.

Unfortunately, dfinity's reputation, regardless of its nature, blinds the public and accelerates it in a negative way.

I am concerned that this technology will be buried due to marketing failures.

dfinity believes in community growth and is paranoid with plausible numbers, but from what I've seen so far, it's just an echo that cries into the air.

I want developers to know that the reality is very political, cold and naive people can only be used and thrown away.

I am not good at English, so I used Google Translate. please understand.

> Stop telling them the IC will make them obsolete. As the saying go you catch more bees with honey than vinegar.

Whether or not Dom points it out, they know that the IC has the potential to make many of their projects obsolete. So the IC has natural enemies, both in the crypto sphere and from very powerful cloud services.

I think it's important to acknowledge this and consider how it can make marketing this product an exceptional challenge. Nobody wants to be led by the hand to their grave.

Nope. The IC is great but the community is quite deluded about several things.
You arent going to convert anyone by making ridiculous & untrue claims. Only by being honest about the tradeoffs will you get them to listen. These people arent stupid.

In general its standing in the current web3 landscape. Its not even close to being a threat to the existing chains if it cant handle Super Mario. And I havent seen any indication of DFINITY trying to address this.

Meanwhile the community keeps parroting "decentralized frontends" which could go down at the snap of a finger.

Its only good for certain things at the moment, wallets, being a meta-layer for other chains, some simple dapps. Those are all things that are under threat from other projects which choose to specialize in those areas instead of trying to be a jack of all trades. Good luck competing with permissionless innovation. See [Nillion](https://www.nillion.com/) for example.

If you listen to the latest townhall with psychedelic, harrison makes the exact same points, because he has prior experience from web3, unlike most of the community.

Now, chain key is still amazing, and it can do many things other chains cant. But you arent going to get any of the people who matter even consider it unless you are transparent about the flaws. And the fact that Dom and the community keep slinging shit at other chains isnt fucking helping at all.

This is one of the biggest doubts I have with the IC, have they cast the net too wide and in doing so doomed the project to become a jack of all trades, which in time will be surpassed by other projects? 
I have a feeling we are in the middle of the "decentralization spectrum", decentralized enough to be less performant than cloud, but not enough to be censorship resistant. The same logic can also be applied to use cases, IC has many but doesn't shine at any of them due to lack of focus.

The Swiss Army Knife was always a niche device. Nobody used it for construction. Nobody used it for slicing. It was even worse for self defense. But it was well marketed.

The iPhone, on the other hand, quickly gained mass adoption. People still purchase calculators, watches, cameras, and GPS... but those are the items that are now niche.

Use cases tend to thrive in open systems with solid fundamentals. But they also need a lot of attention.

I proposed a weekly  livestream to dfinity grants called " the blockchain show" to review different blockchains/dapps etc. Not crypto speculation.  But looking into who is gainting traction,etc. 
Im a construction worker with very strong desire to understand...most people are clueless as to what the hell blockchain is.
Really really dumb things down. Should be the marketing.
Although ...supply creates demand ..so build good dapps and theyll come.
But isnt blockchain a bunch of nerds trying to be the next jeff bezos? Why should i care?
It is my suggestion to talk about these things. 
God bless

No. It cant be run by dfinity or any other blockchain. It needs to be outside of the loop. Them funding it is fine through their grant program. But it doesnt directly tie to it . Its like saying, heres some money, investigate all you wish.  Blockchain is overwhelming for the average joe.
Im sure from the developer perspective at IC this is stupid, but people have been duped by developers/computer geeks. Facebook and google steal our data, amazon keeps all of our records,  the trust between developers and the general public is broken. So why should we trust any of this? It seems like a scam to make developers rich.
A weekly show,(streaming so that people can interact) looking if anything these blockchains actually say is real or worth it. 
Or is there secret code collecting data? Or is it actually funded by a secret agency? 
Devs can figure this out easily. Actually the code is crazy confusing unless youre an expert programmer, but thats a whole other topic.

I want an ICP convention. This is the answer to the question of marketing ideas. I should also clarify that this is an in-person conference, not a digital (zoom) conference or attending as an avatar in the metaverse conference (although that would interesting).

If this is in the current plans already under development please count me in as an early-bird RSVP! I’m ready to spend my money to engage with this community someplace, make connections, learn and invest my time, money and energy into help this grow.

Just some ideas for the conference: 
I want demo’s of the apps being built on the ICP and I want to fully interact with the functional apps already deployed, I want leadership to take us down the roadmap, I want to meet other #8yeargang passionate enthusiasts and I definitely want to hear from the team that contributes to this awesome project and it better be in a nice location at a fantastic resort. I’m sure everyone involved with the project would like to be at a resort for a few days, unwind and have fun talking about ICP, sharing in something we are all so passionate about and bring us closer together as a community. It would be fun for everyone involved to get together - build community and  camaraderie, foster new ideas, grow the brand and interest from the developers and business community in one place (please be a warm place and have a beach)! Start small and work our way up as the community grows. It also might help detoxify the community as concerns were expressed in another post.

-------------------------

shruti | 2022-08-26 13:25:36 UTC | #53

Came across this - Dfinity is organizing an in-person meetup in Zürich - it's not a convention as you are suggesting but I guess it's a start.  https://www.meetup.com/internet-computer-meetup/events/287777176/

Although, not sure if an internal convention will answer the marketing question as it's going to remain quite 'internal' and limited to the existing community - I am not saying it should not be done - just that it has a different purpose.

Denis | 2022-08-27 04:12:34 UTC | #54

I hope every Dfinity supporter with a Twitter account will retweet the latest crypto leaks investigation. Their previous scoops got little attention, possibly because they were transparently Dfinity-focused. The latest one exposes a structural problem that goes beyond the IC and therefore has potential to make more people pay attention.
Here's the tweet: https://twitter.com/CryptoLeaksInfo/status/1563286425197776898

Also, through reddit notice boards, bring it to the attention of the Solana community, which is far larger.

I think an influential celebrity is needed to speak for ICP. The ICP technology is very good and advanced, but no one knows that when it comes to ICP, people can only think of tokens that have been falling all the way. For example, this integrated online test network with BTC, I only got news in the community, and I couldn't see any voices in other media and blockchain celebrities. No matter how good the technology is, it must first attract people's attention to attract developers.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-29 04:22:43 UTC | #56

The Goon has responded; this is good news, as soon as people feel the need to deny something like the latest crypto leaks allegations, they tie themselves up in knots and give the allegations much more publicity:
https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1564006450531377156
Having said this, Dfinity needs to clarify its connection with crypto leaks. Although its investigations are credible, crypto leaks looks Dfinity funded rather than the independent media outlet Dominic Williams makes it out out be.

What concerns me a bit is the approach of tayloring marketing to specific people. I know that makes sense for many products but I doubt this to be the right approach here for 2 reasons. 

1) All Blockchains more or less try to achieve the same thing. People are aware what the value proposition is. It’s more or less clear to everyone that we want more scale per „level of decentralization“. 

2) There still seems to be no explanation of the IC out there that truly nails it. It‘s equivalent to selling google glasses by saying „its this thing that contains glass“. 

Given these two points it feels unconvincing to talk about reverse gas model, http calls etc.

I read heavily into dozens of projects and I always just wanted to know one thing. Does it scale significantly better than anything else without just being more centralized.

Personally I would not care at all about any other feature (I find them brilliant though!). Or maybe I‘d care to the extent that I would dig harder trying to understand the scaling approach. Trust is the core value proposition of this system. 

People that are committed to crypto all go through the process of figuring out what specifically to commit to. Nobody wants to be on the loosing thing. What you need to give people are the tradeoffs and the analogies to other chains.

Just make clear that it’s about sharding! Explain what a beacon chain does (communication between shards) and explain how it limits the number of shards that can be added. People don’t get sharding yet but they know ethereum will do it. It‘s easy to figure out they will only add 64 shards. IC can add orders if magnitudes more. Explain sharding better than Ethereum does it (pretty bad…)

Is there a marketing working group? I‘m not experienced in marketing but damn I read into many projects…

Of course it can be that others do these things very differently compared to myself. I doubt it though, people are scared to bet on the wrong horse. I think they DO the work, if you make it reasonably easy for them, they will notice the IC.

This is much more subjective than I initially thought, some would say yes, others me included, aren't so convinced.

Not sure how much that matters atm, what most care about are actual use cases and partnerships with known brands/companies and I'm talking about real partnerships, not the useless ones many chains brag about but don't amount to anything, many L1s have big tech companies like MS and Google as partner on their sites but it's only for minor stuff, not an actual product or service. To this end Dfinity should try to snag some talent from Matic :smile:

[quote="Yue, post:55, topic:14664"]
I think an influential celebrity is needed to speak for ICP
[/quote]

Step 1. There need be channels open to reward the so called celebrities. Who will funnel the money? 

Can a system be set to have the NNS or SNS automatically reward persons per contribution…how many people they influence to actively participate in ICP, either through investment, building projects or constantly using The IC products. 

Does this exist, if so then the next step would be figuring out how to turbo charge the process. 

Step 2. What would go wrong ? Usually it’s the opposition. It’s easy to get in trouble by the law because there are no clear guidelines on the chain of events to a successful promotion. 

Step 3. Speaking from a black community, Education has been key in transforming communities. When missionaries came to Africa besides building churches they built schools. That helped the communities thrive and hence more people were inclined to join Christianity. 
To have mass adoption of the IC there need be actual  schools or universities that would educate the next generation of block chain engineers and investors. 
It could be as easy as setting up a class, example with a professor in NAIROBI UNIVERSITY. Or getting a building set up a building because just online communication would not get the job done. Also The Bible says it better, instead of giving a man fish, teach him to fish. The hardest part of this is that it relies on well wishers. It would be much easier for black artists to promote this project mostly when there is motive of developing the community other than financially. Just my thoughts

-------------------------

Mathias | 2022-10-06 06:51:05 UTC | #61

Thanks for challenging my assumption I thought that maybe it was just me caring about this... Would love to further discuss this.  

To me, it seems likely that the differences in scalability between different Blockchains are clearly exponential rather than anything else. With that, I just mean that there seem to be these crazy improvements that unlock orders of magnitude more scale. 

With that in mind and when thinking that it might not always be trivial to replace specific pieces of these systems. Can you really say you would not care if some other chain is 50x more scalable than the IC with a similar level of decentralization? My point is yes things like partnerships as well as further features matter. But the thing is, also the partners might choose to switch to the more scalable chain at some point.

Of course, I do understand network effects as well. But it feels to me that there is a race between network effects and technological improvements. Both are exponential things. So a chain being 1000x more scalable than anything out there might easily be powerful enough that all the partners switch to that new system. 

Scalability seems to be the key thing that makes people move. Maybe I'm just repeating myself and you just have a different (and totally legit) opinion. I'm curious to hear more of your thoughts.

You are most definitely no the only one but so far the crypto market has showed it often values narratives and dApps more than decentralization, e.g Matic, BSC, Sol, etc...

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-01 20:37:30 UTC | #63

I basically agree, @senior.joinu. I don't see marketing as the problem for the IC right now. 

The IC value proposition is not in its circulating currency, like other crypto, but in its ability to build full-stack Web3 applications on top of it as the next iteration of the Internet. That's why only ICP has a reverse gas model, which is what will dominate in the long run. All other coins and token economies assume that millions (and eventually billions) of end users of dapps will want to become token investors or not be very put off by having to deal with a complex mix of token transactions to accomplish anything. This is a huge mistake that only ICP's reverse gas model currently solves.

Moreover, the SNS capability to build all those SNS dapps is only being rolled out now. It's still quite piecemeal and basically in beta, so let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. The public marketing evangelization that we hope for from a plethora of charismatic leaders can wait until after we have a thriving SNS ecosystem of token economies to congregate around. In the meantime, the early adopters (both developers and end users) will come without more marketing, as they are doing now. 

Later on, with VC backing, SNS token economies will be doing their own marketing and evangelizing. I would prefer that DFinity stick to its non-profit R&D knitting in the background and not try to transform itself into yet another platform monolith or business development evangelist to the masses. Just focus on building the next Internet and on keeping the developer community informed, educated and supported. DFinity should not become the center of attention as the next revolutionary launchpad and monopoly dapp incubator. Doing so would obviously increase the risk of DFinity becoming the #1 target of future ICP censorship.

Like the Internet, the Internet Computer will largely speak for itself as it gradually becomes the next indispensable commodity of humanity. If we are truly successful, no one in the distant future should even care who built this magic Internet network and world computer that humanity takes totally for granted.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-11-01 22:10:10 UTC | #64

Technically speaking, it's *not* desirable for certain tech companies. 

How about? The IC is turning into an unprecedented decentralized cloud infrastructure that makes it possible for other blockchains to not rely on the tech companies whose self preference dominates and inhibits independent developer innovation. Additionally because the IC is built on the principles of distributed ledger technology while integrating self-permissioned mutability, it is opening up new possibilities in the way we organize and coordinate ourselves digitally, which have hitherto necessarily been dominated by custodial centralization; I'd even be willing to bet without something like the IC, other blockchains may never themselves get enough critical mass to realize the benefits of their permissionless decentralized network effects. 

Sorry I can't be more specific other than to create a dapp to demonstrate exactly what this means. Hopefully that helps paint a clearer picture.

[/quote]

Could it be because the IC can replace the entire IT tech stack, whereas the EVM is like a one-trick pony of programmable debits and credits by comparison? 

The better question is how can you expect the IC to launch a storm of SNS token economies without completing the essential components of that new Internet tech stack? Building such a revolutionary platform and *then* having third parties build enterprise-scale software applications and communities on top of that -- all within the ICP blockchain -- is going to take *years*, not months, to get to any level of mass market penetration. More marketing won't make this timeline any shorter, just like throwing more marketing or money at the metaverse won't make it arrive any faster for Meta. The good news is that the IC is already years ahead of the competition, since no other blockchain has even entered this level 0 blockchain race yet.

If you are not in it for the long haul as an ICP investor, then you are going to be continually very disappointed - you will inevitably bail out way to soon after adamantly complaining about how better marketing could have brought the IC vision to fruition sooner. ICP is completely unlike any other crypto investment, so take a deep breath and reset your expectations. I believe that patience will be greatly rewarded, but impatience will lead to many months of frustration and then a lifetime of regret.

Jonathan | 2022-11-02 06:48:33 UTC | #66

The goal of this thread is to present grassroots solutions to a widely recognized problem.

I don't think the IC is necessarily going to crash and burn without enhanced marketing, but the roadmap forecast has fallen substantially short of predictions. This isn't a strength.

Increased visibility and usage is a legitimate means for solving several of the problems that appear in this forum regarding price and inflation.

In a theory, time is not relevant. In reality it is.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-02 16:00:15 UTC | #67

Indeed, time is *very* relevant. Hence my emphasis on the importance of both the extended timescale (to build the IC properly as the first and only L0 blockchain) and the marketing timing (to match that extended timescale). 

When marketing hype is poorly timed on an extended development timescale, it ends up sounding like a vaporware pump-and-dump to momentum-addicted crypto investors when that functionality doesn't materialize in production for many more months. Even worse, it makes it easy for detractors to spin an obviously false rug pull narrative. As everyone knows, DFinity has already been dogpiled on social media based on these false scam allegations in the months after genesis.

Don't worry, once working products based on some of the game-changing functionality in the R&D pipeline becomes available (e.g., native BTC and ETH blockchain integration, HTTP calls to replace oracles, etc.), there will be no shortage of marketing hype from many sources that will be easy for almost everyone to understand.

Nah it has to do more with the fact Dfinity ignored the topic for more than 1 year, despite the fact it was clear the community wasn't coming to an agreement and discussions on the topic were stagnating, they only got around to it when they realized no token standard meant no DeFi and they needed one for the "upcoming" SNS and ckBTC ledger.

Marketing and marketing education is definitely the biggest issue for IC.

I've been active in the crypto community for a long time, and ICPL.app and I have also organized a developer community for IC, which now has over 500 people.

As I spoke with these developers, for those who are not in the IC community and are more used to EVM, they hardly know that the IC network exists, and are completely unaware of the features and technical innovations of IC. At the same time, I hardly see any articles or reports from research and investment organizations comparing IC to other public chain infrastructures, and many data sites do not include IC, which does not match the market cap ranking of ICP.

I know some of you may contradict me, but these potential developers, who are not stubborn ETH maximalists, are actually very open to develop on Solana, Aptos, Sui and Cosmos, even if it means learning a new language and embracing unfamiliar architectures. We shouldn't use the fact that IC is a separate architecture as a reason for developers not to care.

The fact is that many IC developers are losing information because ICP prices and the roadmap not meeting expectations, and they may have already tried other chain. While a large number of good developers, who do not have access to IC from any of the mainstream media and crypto discussions, prefer to go to other ecosystem.

As a result, the infrastructure on IC is very slow to build, applications with potential to explode are hard to come by, and the adoption rate of IC continues to decline.

I consider myself to be a marketing and sales person. If you follow ICPL.app, you'll see that we do a lot of marketing and education (we just finished the the [INTERSTELLAR Eco Summit](https://summit.icpl.app/), where over 20k people watched 30 IC projects demo online). Especially before ICP Genesis, DFINITY and ICPL.app held some offline and online events to make almost all crypto users (especially in Asia) excited about IC.

However, until now, the community and DFINITY did not agree on what IC can do, what the features of IC are, how IC can attract users and developers, etc. DFINITY also appears less in blockchain media, rarely even participates in crypto industry conferences and events, and hardly cooperates with other ecosystem, we seriously lack communication with the whole crypto. The outside world doesn't know what's happening with IC, even as we launch one very powerful new feature after another.

I think we should open up the channels of communication with the whole crypot, go more to communicate with developers, investors, users outside the IC ecosystem, and be more vocal through media channels.

Kurtis0108 | 2022-11-03 09:04:00 UTC | #72

There's no point in marketing while Dfinity controls the entire network. We're still in the beta phase of the network if it can't function without the developers manually controlling it.

I think we are talking past each other somewhat, since I was not including "keeping the developer community informed, educated and supported" in marketing: 
[quote="Sabr, post:63, topic:14664"]
Later on, with VC backing, SNS token economies will be doing their own marketing and evangelizing. I would prefer that DFinity stick to its non-profit R&D knitting in the background and not try to transform itself into yet another platform monolith or business development evangelist to the masses. Just focus on building the next Internet and on keeping the developer community informed, educated and supported.
[/quote]
I definitely agree that DFinity could do more developer outreach and education to build more developer mindshare. I think they realize this too based on the success of Supernova and other recent outreach efforts. However, I don't believe that DFinity should be focusing on superficial marketing to the masses or even investors, which ends up sounding more like hype. That hype may ultimately be quite real, but the vision it is based upon is many years away. For the time being, DFinity should focus on encouraging developers to experiment with the IC and to help their projects be developed as successfully as possible, not on marketing. As an R&D organization, that also happens to be DFinity's core competency.

Marketing is among other things about building partnerships. Bob Bodily of Toniq tweeted the IC should pair with Polygon for NFTs because "Meta, Reddit, Starbucks, Draft Kings, NFL, Liverpool Football Club, Dolce & Gabbana, Macy's, Adidas, Adobe, Stripe, Circle, and more have all used Polygon." Had Dfinity directly partnered with a few important organisations, there would be no need to consider pairing with another blockchain which has done the hard lifting already. 
The IC has unique NFT capabilities which surely some major companies could have been induced to try out by now? I suggested upthread a partnership with a prestigious art collection to build an NFT archive that would showcase the IC's technology and would attract plenty of media attention. There are many ways to bring the tech to wider notice which have not been tried out.
A number of fabulously planned and meticulously built ghost towns exist in the world...

I think we are on the same page here, @Denis, based on your posts that I've read so far. I just don't think "marketing" is quite that fungible of a term (pun intended), which is a minor point in the scheme of things. 

For example, I really like your NFT idea about archiving a prestigious art collection. However, I see that as more of a development pilot or partnership, rather than marketing. The bulk of that investment would be a development effort compared to any marketing effort to showcase the project. Your idea does highlight, though, the importance of allocating development outreach efforts to projects with some high public visibility potential. That should definitely be a major criterion to consider in allocating these scarce resources.

Big opportunity to foster a relationship with BitBoy Crypto (Ben) right now. 1.4 million YouTube subscribers, major influencer.

He bought into the "ICP is a scam" mantra and has just turned 180 after realizing SBF was the scam all along. @ld-dfn1 and others, please continue to follow up on this: https://youtu.be/eAP44rBoPjQ

I think @dominicwilliams would also appreciate this opportunity.

Update:

Glad to see Dominic [following up](https://youtu.be/DIWDjcgCKnI) on this opportunity.

**Marketing or Advertising**
Marking is when you are working with very little and you create a vision of something being more than it is, lots of BS.

Advertising is when you provide a service that is running and operational.

DFINITY should build its vision and they will come when the services are running.


The main problem as I see it today is my personal information and how it is used against me!


Organizations have proven that not only can they not protect my personal information but abuse it for any and all their purposes. That I should be able to control censorship access from abuse or because I want to.

Should not the IC provide a neuron with the ability to process payments from information within my neuron and login to all website with that neuron?

The IC is not in the business of creating websites or running business operations but running a new network that provides the security and transaction that a network should provide. It should demonstrate how any organization can operate an online service that overcomes the criminal elements, provides personal details security and will therefore bring more investment into this project for DFINITY to build this network. 

Many main tech companies pay billions in fines for security breaches and have the funds to build on the IC, forget the pubs, show big tech how to protect personal information on the IC with incentives and have these teams building on the IC and let the IC build the network and these large tech companies will burn the cycles.

I wanted to get my icp coins on binance into my plug wallet. However, I saw that the plug wallet could not connect to the binance network.Binance network doesnt knows plug wallet. This time I have got an infinityswap wallet. Unfortunately, swapinfinity wallet could not connect with binace either. In short, I want to say this. **For marketing to be successful**, All ICP wallets must be able to engage with the ethereum and BNB chains. Because these are the densest networks. Wallets such as metamusk and TWT, which are the most widely used in the market, should also be able to communicate with the ICP network. A special team should be established urgently within the Developer team so that only safe and network interactions can be ensured.
Otherwise all the time and money spent on marketing will be wasted

This may seem stupid, but the way the internet at large had correlated "internet computer protocol" with "insane clown posse" is a disgrace. to that end though, why doesn't IC capitalize on this and hire shaggy 2 dope to talk about it, how internet computer and IC are not related. It would be very meme worthy and a crowd conscious acknowledgement of a long-standing issue.

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-11-20 17:24:02 UTC | #81

Yes, it's a disgrace.

I agree, some of the 'value propositions' that Dom offers are not very convincing or appealing. 

The major one seems to be the proposed value prop of 'decentralising/rebuilding the web'. 

To me, this doesn't make sense because 1) it has a ridiculously large scope that is unattainable (better off focusing on narrow value propositions) 2) the web is arguably decentralised already 3) people are pretty happy with the web as it is 4) claims of rebuilding the web with a protocol that is largely directed by a single foundation/person is going to draw widespread criticism (again, maybe better to corner a niche section of internet where the IC allows people to do things they could not have previously done).

Hi Dfinity,

Somebody should be putting together a list of high profile bitcoin conferences over the coming year and having someone attend and give presentations on the integration. 

Anecdotally, a bunch of btc maxis I have spoken to have poo poo’d the integration as shit coin antics. If we want to convince a subset of the bitcoin population that this tech is game changing I don’t think we can let the tech speak for itself. We need to go to the conferences and pitch them where they are. Will take time to build trust. 

Also should be targeting bitcoin publications and media.

I honestly think marketing doesn't matter almost at all. I think what matters is getting companies to recognize how revolutionary ICP is. I came over from Algorand and I am blown away at how much more advanced ICP is than other chains. I didn't even know that building a full stack app was possible on blockchain lol. And now I realize that the only thing that is "on-chain" on other blockchains is the backend logic. I think that needs to be stressed. You can say your dapp is "on-chain" all day and night, but unless you are using something like ICP to host your website along with other things, it isn't safe from censorship. I think what the team at Dfinity is amazing and I really look forward to the future. Best thing I can say is to DCA and be patient.

I hate to say this but changing from a cli to a program that someone could run would make adoption faster

Build it and they will come is not a strategy

OVVOVVO | 2022-12-05 01:35:09 UTC | #89

Now that the Internet Computer is cryptographically integrated with the Bitcoin network, can we receive a rundown of Dfinity's current press releases and marketing strategies for this milestone in blockchain history?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-11 21:42:08 UTC | #91

Also curious for this response. Maybe Dfinity is waiting for ckBTC for the marketing push?

ckBTC just crossed $1,000,000 USD on chain.

It might be good for DFINITY or @dominicwilliams to tweet this out.
