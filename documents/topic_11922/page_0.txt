## 1. Objective

This forum topic and associated proposal is intended to start a conversation.  It is presented as a formal proposal topic in order to stimulate thought about specific actions that can be taken to improve decentralization and increase voter participation in governance.  All details of this proposal will be subject to community and Dfinity feedback during deliberation.  

Proposal:  Reset Followees for the All Topics Except Governance "catch all" category for all neurons.

Explanation: This action will ensure that all governance participants have made intentional decisions about their Followees.  All neurons were configured by default to follow ICA (neuron 28) for All Topics when the neuron was created.  In many cases, this was not a conscious choice by the neuron owners.  It has resulted in many neurons that are not casting votes on Governance motion proposals.  Those neurons are being rewarded for a default passive participation strategy even though the tokenomics design is intended to incentivize active participation.  Removing the Followee designations for All Topics Except Governance for all neurons will cause the neurons to stop voting until they are reconfigured.  Neurons do not earn voting rewards unless they vote.

## 2. Background

A series of [daily governance proposals](https://medium.com/@wpbartlett/list-of-daily-governance-proposals-d835b9b935dc) was submitted to the NNS in February 2022 with the objective of educating the IC community regarding NNS voting and motivating users to increase total vote participation on governance proposals.  The campaign took advantage of the proposal weight changes described in [proposal 34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485) that were implemented in mid February.  Generally speaking, these proposals were not actionable even though they had a clear objective that improved decentralized governance of the NNS.  The final proposal that was submitted was a request to stop the daily governance proposal campaign.  That final proposal passed with an overwhelming majority and serves as a signal that the IC community no longer feels it was necessary to run a daily governance proposal campaign.

However, a [new series of daily governance proposals](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52579) has been started by @ysyms.  His stated objectives are to increase participation in motion proposals and to increase daily returns of neurons participating in motion proposals.  His campaign is expected to last 7 days and 2 motion proposals will be submitted each day.  None of the proposals are being deliberated on the forum and they are difficult to justify as actionable motion proposals.  The primary objective seems to be to submit something for the purpose of increasing voting rewards for people who are voting on governance topics.

It is likely that this pattern will continue by @ysyms or by someone else.  People who vote earn higher than normal voting rewards when governance proposals are submitted because governance proposals have a high weight factor (20) and exchange rate proposals have a low weight factor (0.01) and because Governance topics are no longer linked to the catch all Followee selection of All Topics.  There is a large fraction of neurons that are staked in the NNS that do not vote on governance proposals because they have not configured their neurons to follow someone on the Governance topic.  Hence, these daily proposals targeted at increasing voting rewards for neurons that vote will achieve those increases because others neurons have a decrease in voting rewards when they don’t vote.  This only happens on days where governance proposals are executed, which is why it is attractive to frequently submit proposals that are low effort and not deliberated by the community.  This activity will likely continue unless something changes so this it is no longer desirable.

Two ideas emerge immediately that could easily be considered as a solution, but both have significant drawbacks:

1. Increase the cost of submitting a proposal to the NNS
   1. Pros: This would make it more expensive to submit a proposal, so most people will be more judicious about what types of proposals they submit.  The implementation of this idea is very easy.
   2. Cons: This action is not a deterrent to the whales who have the most to gain from governance proposals.  Putting up this kind of barrier to smaller investors is a move away from decentralization.  It will also discourage people from taking a chance on a proposal that they are not confident will pass.  It is easy for a vocal minority on the forum to have significant influence before a proposal is submitted, but many proposals may need to be submitted in order to learn the opinion of the voting majority.  A high proposal price may discourage someone from submitting the proposal based on feedback from the vocal minority.

2. Weight all proposals equally
   1. Pros: This would be a reversal of the new proposal weights policy back to the old policy.  The implementation may be relatively easy.
   2. Cons:  There are 144 Exchange Rate proposals every day.  Hence, with equal proposal weights, nobody will be incentivized to participate in governance topics.  It is possible to miss voting on all governance proposals and not notice any difference in voting rewards.  This leads to completely passive investing.  It also removes all incentives that improve decentralization by following neurons other than Dfinity or ICA.

As a community, we can do better than these options.  This proposal needs to be scoped to move toward decentralization and continue to incentivize governance participation.  Removing all default following eliminates all desire to submit low effort governance proposals because there would be no default rewards for passive participants.  All voting rewards would go to people who vote manually or who intentionally configure their neurons with Followees.  This action is also likely to increase overall voting participation on Governance proposal topics because people who start seeing zero voting rewards will be inclined to educate themselves and configure their neuron with Followees.  ICP is a governance token and the tokenomics are designed to incentivize participation.  Staking is not intended to be just a source of yield farming.  We should expect that anyone who stakes must remain sufficiently active to know how to participate in governance.

## 3. Pros

Reduce the probability that someone will produce low effort proposals.

Increase decentralization by increasing total percentage of votes that are cast on governance proposals.

Increase active participation in governance

## 4. Cons

This proposal would take time for Dfinity to place on their roadmap and implement, but it does provide time to communicate the change effectively to the IC community.

Over half of the voting power in the NNS is not currently voting on governance proposals, which implies there are likely a lot of neuron owners who will stop receiving voting rewards.  There could be a lot of people who get upset with this change.  The community response to this concern can be provided in simple terms: 1) staking entitles neuron owners to vote, 2) voting entitles neuron owners to voting rewards, 3) voting can occur manually or by liquid democracy through Followee designation, 4) all neuron owners are personally responsible for making sure their neuron is voting if they want voting rewards.  Basically, all neuron owners are empowered to configure their neurons so they can earn voting rewards.

## 5. Alternatives Considered

Several other ideas have surfaced that may be reasonable to consider. Perhaps they should be implemented in addition to the idea presented in the objective section of this proposal.

1. Nullify any proposal that doesn’t meet a 3% “yes” vote threshold.
   1. Clarification: This means treat the proposal as if it did not exist. The results don’t count and the proposal does not count toward any voting awards. The proposal cost would not be refunded.
   2. The effectiveness of this idea may depend on the threshold that is required. The most logical threshold is 3% since that is the threshold defined for Simple Majority.
   3. A counterpoint to this idea is that people who only care about voting rewards may tend to vote yes to ensure the threshold is met.

2. Add an Ignore button to the voting options
   1. Clarification: This button could be called Ignore, Spam, Not Relevant, etc. The purpose of the button would be to enable people to indicate that the proposal is not suitable for NNS governance. If a certain threshold of voting power votes to Ignore the proposal, then the proposal is nullified and it does not count toward voting rewards. The proposal cost would not be refunded.
   2. The effectiveness of this idea depends on the threshold, which is most likely to be a low percentage, but perhaps it could be a high percentage.
   3. The counterpoint to this idea is that a small number of neurons that carry a lot of voting power could nullify a proposal if it is not trending in their favor. Another counterpoint if the threshold percentage is high is that people would not be inclined to select this option since it will result in lower voting rewards.

These ideas are interesting, but not perfect. They are presented to stimulate thought in case someone can identify a tweak that makes them more suitable.

## 6. Key milestones

This proposal will be deliberated for at least 1 week.  When the comments on this topic become quiet, a revised proposal will be developed.  The revised proposal may be submitted in this topic if the topic is not too long and complicated.  Otherwise, a new proposal topic will be created on the forum.  That revised proposal is expected to be deliberated for 1 week before submitting to the NNS for voting.

## 7. Discussion leads

Wenzel Bartlett (@wpb), Kyle Langham (@Kyle_Langham), and other voting members of the ICP Maximalist Network neuron will lead the discussion, revise the proposal according to community feedback, and submit the proposal to the NNS.

## 8. Security concerns

No security concerns have been identified at this time.

## 9. What we are asking the community

* Review comments, ask questions, provide **actionable** feedback

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

Thank you for your incredible methodology Wenzel, I hope everybody will praise such a rigor now we have seen another proposer's manner of proposing.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 10:24:14 UTC | #3

Why are we so comfortable with the idea of manipulating other people’s neurons? I can’t believe that the preferred approach is to repeat the same approach as last time.

It seems like what you’re suggesting is that instead of increasing the cost to submit a proposal, or decreasing the weighting. You want to artificially level the playing field by undoing everyone’s follower setting on all topics. Knowing full well that most VP will be left unconfigured.

I will not vote in favor of manipulating other people’s assets again.

Edit: oddly enough, the one thing this proposal will ensure is that all these “active voters” will get even more rewards. Very convenient.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-05 10:48:03 UTC | #4

Only my opinion, not a suggestion. 

As Wenzel say, this is a governance token, not a passive staking token.  Then...

1 vote per principal ID to remove the whale and Dfinity control
No following possible on governance
Check Box at each proposal:  I have read and understand the proposal

What is the use for hundreds of millions of voting power if they only follow and have no clue of what is going on.  Even worst with the new automatic compounding to come soon.  This is not governance... this is passive staking.
And this is something I will do, soon as the new update comes live.
Adios everyone, read all proposals, vote for me and get me rich please...  I trust you will do a great job.

Sorry for the tone.

roy23 | 2022-04-05 11:08:18 UTC | #5

Fast forward to 2024 the ETH Zurich has started it's first doctoral program on "how to maximize voting rewards on the IC", people that joined the "8 year gang" with the promise of "passive income" now have to spend 2 hours a day reading through proposals to make an "informed decision". better don't go on holidays because could be you come back and find out all rules have been changed retrospectively and your staking returns have vanished.
Why not just overcomplicate everything to the point only full-time IC governance experts get any rewards at all? I have been watching this whole changing of rules the last few months and really wonder how all of this is supposed to make people stake their ICP at all. If you constantly keep changing the reward mechanism the last thing you'll earn is trust. just my 2c

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-05 12:12:11 UTC | #6

Lightning,
To re-iterate the first line: "This forum topic and associated proposal is intended to start a conversation".  The intent is to start a discussion, which is usually easier if there is a concrete idea to discuss.
Your comments and feedback are valuable and I appreciate your point of view.  I'd be interested to hear if you have a preferred solution to the problem at hand, or if you believe there is even a problem to solve.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-05 12:13:33 UTC | #7

Would it be accurate to say that your preference would be no changes to the current model?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 12:21:12 UTC | #8

Sure thing. My suggestion is to use adjust the system’s configuration by either increasing the cost to submit proposals or reduce the governance weighting back to where it was originally.

For concrete numbers I recommend increasing proposal cost to 5 ICP, monitor the outcome and adjust further as needed

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-05 12:23:54 UTC | #9

It's probably useful to have a thread within this thread that discusses the problem we are trying to solve.  This would invite commentary on (a) whether others agree there is a problem to address and (b) the nuance of that problem.

From my point of view, the problems we should aim to solve are below.  We should aim to solve these problems with a long term solution, regardless of the current 7-day proposal.  I'm ordering these problems from non-controversial to controversial.
Problem 1: The NNS and proposal system should not be used for defaming or insulting people or organizations, including DFINITY employees.
Problem 2: The NNS and proposal system should not be used for personnel gain, including requesting donations.
Problem 3: The NNS design and function encourage (or require) a medium or high level of thought and consideration by its voting members on governance topics.  As such, the NNS should not have an abundance of governance proposals, which dilutes its participants' ability to understand and evaluate them.

Those are the problems as I see it, however I'd love it for other forum members to give their feedback on whether they believe there is a problem to address and, if so, what those problems are.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-05 12:27:43 UTC | #10

I think we need to consider both short term and long term. 

**Short term:**

While I fully agree that increasing the reject fee does not fully solve the problem, I think it is a pragmatic approach that we can take literally today (it is a "NetworkEconomics" parameter in the governance canister, so we can have one proposal that just changes this parameter, I think we don't even need an upgrade). Even if this doesn't 100% solve this problem forever, it will reduce the problem now. And i think 1 ICP is just too cheap to force so many people to look at your spam. As a concrete example I would suggest increasing the reject fee to 5 ICP very soon, like in the next days. I think we should do this asap irrespective of which except "long term" solutions we take. 

**Long term:**

I really like the idea of "Nullify any proposal that doesn’t meet a 3% “yes” vote threshold." We can consider more variations of this. We could for example disable following for these "pre-proposals" that are collecting support to become a full proposal (and then likely lower the 3% barrier). That way, you need active support from active community members to create a proposal. The active voters are less likely to vote in favor of spam proposals because they are the ones that suffer from having to deal with this spam. 

I acknowledge that this again does not remove the incentive for spam governance proposals, while the proposal of removing all default following likely does achieve that goal (since all proposals would then likely get equal voter participation). I am hesitant about this approach for two reasons:
- i think it's not nice to change the following rules again and surprise neuron holders 
- this may make it hard for all the other proposals to pass quickly. Right now all non-governance proposals pass quickly because essentially everybody follows the foundation. If we change this and every subnet upgrade proposal takes 4 days to take effect, things will be much slower.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2022-04-05 12:38:26 UTC | #11

I think starting to mess around with the rewards was a slippery slope from the beginning... If I lock thousands of dollars worth of tokens into a neuron under certain terms I'd actually expect the terms to stay the same. In the real world changing things like this would be challenged on legal grounds.

My main point is that confidence will be destroyed and by overly complicating things newcomers just wouldn't want the hassle to join at all. People will just end up staking elsewhere e.g. Binance.

On the topic of governance token is not a passive income token, I think it's unrealistic to expect every staker to always being willing and/or able to make an informed decision. That's why there are Daos that we are able to follow if we trust them and are able to change if we feel like they don't represent us in the way we would like to.

Imagine every citizen had to vote on every single bill put up for vote in congress/parliament. Not really feasible, is it? That's why people came up with representative democracies in the first place...

edit: to come back on topic, increasing the cost on proposals should be a pretty straight forward approach to minimize the amount of spamming imo.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 12:45:07 UTC | #12

I don’t think this proposal is asking people to make informed decisions on every single proposal.  It’s just asking people to make a bare minimum informed decision.  Neurons that are configured by default are not making any informed decisions.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 12:47:06 UTC | #13

Good point about the voting period.  Is there a reason why non governance proposals need a 4 day voting period?  Should non governance proposals revert back to 24 hr voting period?

-------------------------

free | 2022-04-05 12:48:20 UTC | #14

I really like the idea of "pre-proposals". They would be similar to [popular initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland#Constitutional_referendums_(Popular_initiatives)) in Switzerland (and likely other countries): anyone can propose an amendment to the constitution, but they will need some number of signatures in order for it to be put up for vote.

Initially I was thinking more along the lines of penalizing spam (by slashing some significant stake if the community decides a proposal is spammy), but this seems more constructive. And leads nicely into something like weekly voting for initiatives that collect the required number of signatures.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-05 12:51:29 UTC | #15

That is a good point, i guess the voting period could be set appropriately for each category.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2022-04-05 12:57:02 UTC | #16

I actually made the decision to follow dfinity on all topics, and was shocked to see that they stopped voting on governance, this together with changing rewards structure I was forced to follow another neuron of a group I had to research first. If I would have just left the neuron alone (like indended) I would have missed out considerably. Everyone I convinced to lock their neuron and just leave it for a few years will come back to me in anger. I personally can't advice anybody to stake in the NNS as long the rewards system keeps getting changed.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 13:01:54 UTC | #17

Perhaps it’s just me. But this post identifies itself as a “Proposal” with a title of ‘Reset Followees for the “All Topics Except Governance” Category’.

My initial response was made under the impression that we had one week to deliberate on this specific proposal and that’s why I wanted to get my point across.

If this post is intended to be treated more like a topic for community consideration, that would eventually lead to a proposal, then might I suggest adjusting the title and getting rid of the 1 week deliberation period?

Maybe others don’t share this opinion but I tend to approach things differently depending on how they’re presented.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-05 13:11:24 UTC | #18

You can’t change the terms of the contract after you signed it.

The solution is to create a requirement for sponsorship of governance motion by democratically elected representative. This has been solved in real life.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 13:16:53 UTC | #19

The proposal as currently presented is a starting point.  Deliberation will be open at least 1 week, but will be extended if the conversation is still active.  A revised proposal will be submitted for further deliberation.  I think that is how the proposal is presented already.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-05 13:23:22 UTC | #20

The things are simple and clear. Democracy is not anarchy. Democract needs leadership and mentors.

The vision belongs to Dfinity.

Proposals are meant to been constructive improvements of the current situation.

Anything else is considered to be rebellion or sabotage and must be ignored.

Only verified proposers should be allowed to set proposals.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 13:25:35 UTC | #21

Maybe so. I always understood there to be a distinction between topics for community consideration and a draft proposal. Not really a big deal but it helps me frame my thoughts when responding. I’ll try to be more flexible going forward

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-05 13:28:15 UTC | #22

Additionally democracy doesnt mean everyone happy but equal opportunities. 

NNS is ugly or I dont like the blue button and set proposal to change it in pink is pure depreciation of IC.

Reputation of IC, democracy are clearly defined by laws governing behaviors and actions.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-05 13:34:22 UTC | #23

I think the real problem here is that anyone can create a proposal. As the nns grows there will always be bad actors that exploit this. 

I always imagined the evolution of the NNS into a complex government entity.

People campaign for you to delegate your votes to them and then they will work full time creating bills and voting on new changes. In this vision we normal people aren't proposing new governance votes. We need to submit our votes to said elected government officials.

So I propose the long term fix is to create a position like a congress of people that love ICP and their job is to sponsor bills. 

I would argue it should be people with a lot  of followees but we don’t have enough of those… maybe we need to increase the amount of people we follow and these groups sponsor bills.

-------------------------

free | 2022-04-05 13:43:02 UTC | #24

Read up on Swiss democracy (I've lived in Switzerland for some years now). You may change your mind.

Yes, there are good reasons to have elected representatives (particularly in the real world) but there's no good reason to always have to go through them.

-------------------------

janman1970 | 2022-04-05 14:05:31 UTC | #25

With the current rewards system, how many ICP must be staked in a neuron in order for that neuron to receive 2 ICP for voting on one governance proposal? If this is even a possibility, spam proposals will never go away as long as governance votes are given more weight. I was OK with removing Dfinity and ICA as followees on governance topics as a move to more decentralization but really didn't see the need for higher reward weighting.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 14:18:11 UTC | #26

Dfinity didn’t vote on most proposals after the Simple Majority voting mechanism was implemented late 3Q 2021.  There were a lot of governance proposals that had only 5-8% of total voting power cast.  It wasn’t until the proposal weights were implemented that people started making sure they were voting and now we are at 45% participation.  Proposal weights are the mechanism that caused an increase in voter participation.  

The reason spam proposals are attractive to some people is because over half the voting power is not intentionally participating in governance as the system is designed.  The basic  idea behind the proposal as currently presented is that removing default following for All Topics Except Governance will remove the root cause of why spam proposals are attractive.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 14:23:08 UTC | #27

Voter participation just meaning that people adjusted their follower settings to someone other than Dfinity correct? I admit that some people vote manually but there is no way to measure that and I’d argue most vote passively.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 14:25:16 UTC | #28

I think a 5 ICP proposal cost makes sense in our environment today, but I would want to build into the language of the proposal a mechanism for reverting it back to 1 ICP in the future.  I think there are valid reasons for not wanting to solve this problem with proposal cost increases alone, but it makes sense as a temporary solution.  What do you think?  What would be the conditions in which the cost should be reverted?  Or do you think 5 ICP should be a permanent solution?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 14:34:16 UTC | #29

I definitely don’t think it should be permanent. I always assumed it would be a setting that is adjusted on an as-needed basis. At least that’s how I interpreted the NNS documentation at Genesis. 

I think we’ve seen plenty of evidence to suggest that 1 ICP is too cheap. Going to 5 ICP seems like a good first step and we can monitor the outcome. If it’s effective we can leave it be until the day ICP market cap rises and we recognize the need to lower the cost.

Edit: fwiw - I am in favor of coming up with a better long-term solution (excluding the resetting of neurons). But I think we have levers we can pull today to deter this sort of negative behavior

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-05 14:34:08 UTC | #30

I think that the network is young, and we are dealing with bootstrapping a voter base. The different types of proposals are not any more or less important to each other, imho. So the weighting should be severely adjusted. If we implemented a minimum threshold (3%, or whatever) of manual votes before a proposal becomes "valid," and we have less weighting to the governance proposals (lower incentive for spam), we could capture real change, with less active participation. The participation is what was not functioning prior to the "shocking" change to the follows and weights.

Can I say, as an aside, that thinking through all of this with you all is TOUGH AS HELL! And simply going through all of this, with an intent to make the system better, deserves kudos across the board. Thank you all for your contributions.

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2022-04-05 14:34:37 UTC | #31

NNS Motion costs only 1 ICP, and if it passes, 1 ICP will be refunded, so the adapted motion(s) has no cost at all! There should be a cost to bringing a motion. Perhaps if it fails 2 ICP and passes 1 ICP or flat fees pass or fail, and I think that is even better. Bringing a motion should be another way of burning ICP

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-05 14:38:01 UTC | #32

Can we just stipulate that it’s always worth $200 to make a governance poll and the icp is updated once a week. So the amount of icp is variable to market conditions.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-05 14:38:57 UTC | #33

Proposal cost in cycles, paid in ICP. I love it. (Burn baby, burn!)

Very insightful analysis! Thanks for taking the initiative!

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:11922"]
Nullify any proposal that doesn’t meet a 3% “yes” vote threshold.
[/quote]

I actually think this one is the best solution, maybe with a tweak that nullify any proposal that doesn't meet 3% overall participation (or 6%?, anyway some sensible number).

As community leaders, named neurons should take an active step in dealing with spams. So they will all abstain if it is clearly a spam, which saves everybody's time.

If a topic manages to get above 3% without any named neuron's participation, it means we have large enough a crowd who bothered to vote manually, or we have an "unamed" neuron that is also a "community leader". In either case, it says that enough voting power don't think the topic is a spam, so perhaps it really isn't?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-05 14:45:05 UTC | #35

I have a substack article coming out later today on this topic.  There's about 49M in voting happening through manual votes.

Your criticism is harsh, but right on the nail. I know some seed investors who are not "technical" enough to use command line, and do not have a hot key setup to vote manually. They are already missing out in governance voting rewards, and it would be really unfair that they are banished from getting any rewards at all.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 14:52:24 UTC | #39

Nice, I look forward to reading it. Do you intend to explain how you distinguish between manual and passive voting?

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-05 15:00:18 UTC | #40

Thinking about "rewards" I had this thought stream:

1) We want ICP to be a governance token, NOT A SECURITY!
2) Seed INVESTORS see this as an INVESTMENT (not active participation) <- That makes ICP a security
3) Seed investors are not active voters (if they were, we would call them voters, not investors)
4) Seed investors made their money on the value increase in ICP, NOT ON GOVERNANCE REWARDS!
5) Governance rewards are not intended to be investment rewards, SEED INVESTORS DO NOT DESERVE THESE, they aren't contributing to governance!

I LOATHE the consistent discussion about how to "protect" investors. Don't. They can fend for themselves. I'm NOT empathic towards people who want their money to earn them money for doing nothing. Value must be proven. The seed investors earned their rewards, ICP is more than $0.07. If they want rewards from voting, THEN MAKE THEM VOTE!

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 15:04:29 UTC | #41

I know your heart is in the right place and I don’t disagree with your genera message about voting. My issue is that what has been proposed so far does not change the fact that people can still earn rewards passively. If we really want to ensure that people are actually voting themselves then we need to get rid of liquid democracy. Otherwise I don’t see how it would be fair to judge seed round participants any different than post-Genesis participants.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-05 15:06:59 UTC | #42

Agreed. The missing link here is People Parties. If we could tag neurons as real, and slowly age that tag, active participation would be a simple metric.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-05 15:11:29 UTC | #43

"Once a voter always a voter" is simply not true. So, just because seed investors "believed" in the system at their investment time, does not make them contributing members of the DAO. It makes them seed investors. In the startup space, investors are poison. They provide nothing but hope (income for people building change), and often rip that away without fair notice. It is not beneficial to the system to protect the less active. Investment is not a set it and forget it activity. If you want to make your living off of investments, then you need to take an active role in each of your investments. If the investment loses value, and you are invested but didn't DYOR consistently, that is the investors fault.

ildefons | 2022-04-05 15:15:09 UTC | #44

I think it is important to make ICP staking interesting for the average investor without technical. If we move to a reward model only rewarding active voters we are pushing away a huge portion of potential investors. Right now, I don´t think we are in position to be picky about who deserve to receive rewards.

I can relate to this difficulty with command line interface.  I am not a programmer or developer and I find it very difficult.  Fortunately, there are very good instructions in the internet computer wiki (link below).  It's a one time CLI setup so you can control your neuron through hotkeys using the NNS dApp.  I would very much like people who are having difficulty with this task learn how to control their neurons so they can participate in governance.  What kind of initiatives do you think would help?  I think anyone who wants to participate should be able to participate at this point.

I definitely think liquid democracy is important in this governance system, but I'm not at all opposed to resetting all Followees periodically (6 mo? 1 yr?) so people have to reconfirm their Followee decisions.  To me, any time you make a conscious decision about how you will participate you are active.  It doesn't mean voting manually all the time.  Periodic confirmation or your decisions make sense to me.

@Kyle_Langham @wpb 

There’s a few other solutions in addition to the two mentioned above that does not involve increasing the barrier to entry or reducing governance rewards. 


One of these solutions (shown below) is detailed in [this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915/3)

[quote="justmythoughts, post:1, topic:11915"]
Governance Proposals have a minimum week-long incubation time before going live, and governance voting rewards are fixed on a weekly basis
[/quote]

I disagree with both solutions advertised here as they either act to raise the barrier to entry for submitting proposals (form of censorship), or reduce the governance voting rewards (decrease incentive). Both lead us in the opposite direction of where we want to be going in terms of NNS participation.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-05 15:40:59 UTC | #51

I agree, I used strong words. If you provide value to a team, label yourself with a title denoting your value. Advisor, engineer, visionary, marketer, community champion, there are valuable contributions that can be made directly to a team. Providing money, and nothing else, does very little good outside of funding the work. There is obvious value in funding people's hard work, but don't get confused that the initial funding earns continued rewards. Continue to provide value, and continue to be rewarded. I'm tired of rich people thinking they can freeload off others work, because they have capital.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 15:45:42 UTC | #52

Thanks for sharing.  I will check it out.  

Would you please clarify your thoughts on this proposal?  There is only one proposal on the table at this time as well as may other potential ideas, so your comments about "both" solutions has me curious what you have interpreted from the discussion.  I also don't understand what you mean about reducing the barrier to entry or reducing voting rewards as an interpretation of this proposal.  I don't think that is what would happen with this proposal at all, so I'd like to better understand your thoughts.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-05 15:47:46 UTC | #53

Playing devil's advocate. I think we have a clear need for continued investment at this stage in the network. There is value added from people who are willing to provide the capital needed to keep the network running/growing. I agree with @ildefons that we haven't really achieved the level of proliferation needed to push away capital investment.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 15:49:18 UTC | #54

I am not a techie, so I can relate to your sentiment here as well as the struggles of anyone who is forced to use CLI to interface with their neurons.  Do you have any ideas for actionable solutions to the non-techie part of the problem?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-05 15:52:54 UTC | #55

The 4 day period is a lifesaver for those that haven't automated voting yet.  24 hours is too high of a burden to most people. For example, I have a personal commitment to my family to not use my phone on Saturdays and Sundays as much as it can be avoided.  At 4 days you need to check twice a week to vote on everything.  I'd argue that this could fit almost every schedule.  Holidays and vacations are an issue, but that is why we have the following.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2022-04-05 15:53:12 UTC | #56

lol you're tired of capitalism while profiting off it. So why sell tokens in the first place? why list on exchanges and make big launch event and advertising? Oh yeah devs should all get rich, dumping on the bad greedy investors. sorry but this doesn't make sense to me. collect money from people to start a company and then shit on your investors because they didn't add value?

-------------------------

peng2021 | 2022-04-05 15:53:52 UTC | #57

I think proxy voting has been the choice of many people. Imagine that everyone takes some time to vote. This is unrealistic and complex. It will only keep people away from this complex stacking. For most people, time is the most precious thing. This is just my idea, not my suggestion.

Agreed the 4 days is necessary on governance proposals, but the question was in relation to non governance proposals.  Are there any non governance proposals that you think need a 4 day voting period at this time?  All non governance proposals are currently executed by Absolute Majority because everyone follows Dfinity.  I can’t think of any that would need to be more than 24 hrs.

I'm not shitting on investors. I have used strong words, because I have strong experiences. I am FOR investing. I am FOR capitalism. However, I'm also for aligning value appropriately. Investors are given way too much pull. There is NOTHING special about an investors capital. Any investor can invest money. The devs shouldn't get rich , either. They have their value, and it should be aligned appropriately. But, I'm not for shitting on anyone. I want all parties to earn their fair share. My point is that investors are often entitled, but don't earn the "respect" they are given. if you are solely an investor, then your value is in where you put your investments. Stay in your lane, investors.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-05 16:35:15 UTC | #68

Well I think that proposals can be set only by verified persons.

To be verified, you must be a part of DAO

The proposals must be set only by the represenation of the DAOs that proposer belongs

DAOs can set daily proposals

DAOs are able to set group of governance proposals once per 3 months.

DAOs are responsible for the executations of their proposals.

To set a governance proposal must follow a protocol of rules and orders in order to be eligible for vote.

What do you think of that?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-05 16:36:19 UTC | #69

Messing around with tokenomics shouldn't be easy as it is right now, on other chains changing the smallest thing about the protocol is a huge deal, on the IC you just need 3% of voting power, this has to change as it is unfair towards 8 year stakers and makes staking less appealing for outsiders and newcomers.

I think at the very least the minimum VP required to pass a proposal has to be raised and for every changes to tokenomics there should be a 30 days timeframe to allow unhappy stakers to immediatly dissolve their neuron, such a change wouldn't just be fair towards stakers but also incentivize good tokenomics proposals, cause if something were to pass without a clear majority there is a risk of lots of tokens being released on the market.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-05 16:39:18 UTC | #70

Thats how you make a not very decentralized system less decentralized. Who decides what is a DAO and what stops a DAO from spamming proposals?

-------------------------

Cris.MntYetti | 2022-04-05 16:41:53 UTC | #71

One thing I'm starting to think about..if ICP is just a voting token, and doesn't want to be a security, then it shouldn't have a "real money" counter value, should it? Let's face it, I staked my neuron because I was going to be able to participate in building the network, yes, but also for the passive income, and I think most people staked because of that initial promise. A new series of questions are arising atm. Why should anyone lock for 8 years with the NNS for a 20% APY when you can stake on Binance with a 120 days lock for 25%+ APY guaranteed, without the burden of voting manually, or assuring you follow someone that votes for you? 
One could say that contributing to building the network is like contributing to your local government to keep building your surrounding society. So you pay taxes in order to receive services like healthcare, road maintenance, legal assistance, etc. If ICP is not a security, if it's not a way of receiving passive income, where's the benefit? What am I, like others, getting except glory for building an utopic future? 
Might have gone a bit off-topic I guess, but the last few days got me wandering a bit. I don't have solutions in mind, I don't have a background in political, economic, nor technical topics. I'm just throwing out what I think could be food for thought.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-05 16:42:57 UTC | #72

DAO must be a followee

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 16:43:36 UTC | #73

You are right that active stakers would get more rewards initially.  In some ways it is the mathematical equivalent of submitting an infinite number of governance proposals every day without submitting any spam proposals, at least in the beginning.  That's why it removes the incentives to spam the NNS with governance proposals.  They are no longer needed if the spamming is happening for the purpose of higher voting rewards.  Those higher rewards for active neurons currently come at the expense of inactive neurons not voting on governance.

To be clear though, the reason this proposal can be an effective tool is that it incentivizes all neuron owners to actively participate in governance.  It would be a very strong incentive.  Anyone who is staking can intentionally configure their neurons.  If they did so, then ideally we would have 95+% participation in governance topics.  Anyone who is getting zero voting rewards will eventually ask questions, educate themselves, and select Followees based on intentional decisions instead of default neuron configurations that lead to a completely passive approach and lack of participation in governance.

I really like this idea.  It should be shaped further.  It would disincentivize changes to tokenonics for sure.  I suppose a counter argument is that people who want out of their NNS stake would be more likely to push for changes.  That seems like a loophole that would need to be addressed.

If the NNS is the hub of democracy for the IC, then I think there should be representatives that make policies, bills etc., and submit them on behalf of the voters, like in real life. The difference with real life is, that if I decide that I don’t relate anymore with the values that one of the representatives I follow pushes forward, I just unfollow and vote manually or pass my voting power to someone else and don’t have to wait for another political campaign to occur. So, maybe, the idea of different DAOs, like @Heihachi previously said, that treat governance on the IC and commit to proposing, deliberating, and executing isn’t that bad after all. So a nice set of rules and guidelines should be redacted. Long-term perspective.
Short-term perspective, I think that a 3% “Yes” threshold could be good, as well as the implementation of a “Irrelevant” “Ignore” or whatever you want to call it button.

Remember that seed investors didn't know their neurons will be locked until after launch day. They are forced into this NNS governance participation. So naturally many are not participating. They wanted exit, but none was given. That wasn't fair either. Foundation really screwed up hard on this launch thing, had the seed investors been able to provide more liquidity, ICP price would not started at US$700, and we (the community who believed in this project) would have a better position to present to the world.

The biggest problem with the voting neurons is that anyone can have multiple anchors and neurons to affect the voting procedure.

I think this is most important to be solved

justmythoughts | 2022-04-05 17:21:42 UTC | #82

@wpb Thanks for redirecting me :slight_smile: 

I appreciate the intention and work behind this proposal, but am against this proposal as I believe:

1) It would have the impact of disproportionately rewarding investors who are following the day to day or even week to week action, over more passive investors.
2) It will not have the intended impact of stopping low quality proposals targeted at investor profit. If anything, the group of investors involved in this proposal spamming scheme are coordinated and active - resetting the followees would only give them a chance to temporarily earn greater rewards from governance proposals while the rest of us find time to set up our followees again.

We essentially already did this reset when the governance voting rewards and topic was split out from all of the other voting topics a few months ago, requiring all NNS participants to actively update their governance followee neurons. If this proposal passes, what's stopping a proposal from being passed every 2-3 months to reset the followees and ask NNS users to "actively participate"?

If we want more people to become IC investors, we shouldn't penalize them for their passive investment. It sends the message that "hardcore or more involved IC community members are looking to directly profit or benefit from their investment", which is a dangerous label which that will scare off both small retail and larger investors. 

Through tools like maturity merging (which can be done daily instead of annually for increased rewards), active investors are already rewarded over more passive investors.

I could potentially be on board with a reset cadence that might make sense, but it should give investors adequate time to preconfigure their new followees before the change is made instead of resetting at a distinct moment in time and only after the reset has taken place. For example, DMV car registration is on an annual basis, and car owners are allowed to purchase their next year's car registration at some time in advance of the expiry date. I could definitely get on board with a scheme like this that resets neuron followees every year, but allows NNS participants a grace period in choosing their neuron followees that will apply once the next reset takes place. As a con to this approach, it makes the investing in the IC a more complicated and involved investment than most others that a retail investor would have in their current portfolio (i.e. Bitcoin, equities) -> which can be a drag on overall IC investment and adoption.

-------------------------

janman1970 | 2022-04-05 19:52:16 UTC | #85

I think you are way off-base here. Staking on the NNS was "sold" as a way to make passive income without needing to be actively involved...and in fact there are many articles on adding followees so you never MISS casting a vote. I try to vote on every governance proposal myself, not because of a hope of increased rewards, but because I want to be part of shaping this thing we are all building. I read the proposals and any discussions so I can make an informed decision. If it's over my head or if I just don't have the time, I rely on ICPMN to make the proper decision for me. On many of the other categories, such a node provider rewards, or technical proposals that I'm clueless about, I  trust that the neurons I follow know more than me and will cast the proper vote. If manual voting is required, watch everybody just go with the flow anyway, or throw in an opposite vote because all that matters is getting paid, right? When your money (whether 1 ICP or a million) is tied up for at least 8 years, how can that be considered freeloading?

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-04-05 20:29:47 UTC | #86

For myself, I would add:

#4 The system should not be used for the intent of increasing rewards for any parties, talk of this kind should be taboo or at least highly discouraged as it presents the wrong ideology to new community members.

#5 The NNS shouldn't be used for asking changes/features in 3rd party dApps, this is why the SNS is being built, there will be a time and a place for proposing changes in dApps utilizing the SNS.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-04-05 20:16:36 UTC | #87

I disagree heavily, dedicated liquidity providers are the ones who provide liquidity when an asset opens for trading and that is determined by the exchange, not by individual investors. Dominic has already pointed a finger at FTX, he likely has information we don't.

It is not normal to see any kind of IOU only trading for half of the opening price of the actual asset leading into the launch, highly doubt liquidity is the culprit because IOU's were even less liquid.

plsak | 2022-04-05 21:30:07 UTC | #88

@wpb @Kyle_Langham I noticed that **`Proposal spam prevention mechanism` is part of `Carbon` release (ETA: Q2 2022)** and most likely there is already a plan:
https://medium.com/dfinity/the-internet-computers-post-genesis-r-d-roadmap-dce2938adcde
![image|335x500](upload://caA593Mv43enKAyhjKS5LEJpXWu.png)

So possibly we should involve in the discussion @diegop or other people from Dfinity...?
I feel that it would be **good to prevent proposals with duplicated goals**, each eventually taking different approach.

Plus to me it seems that the extra rewards for Governance proposals are decreasing, so it might even fix itself - if all (majority of) stakers will start to vote or follow some other neuron (they must have noticed decrease in rewards already).

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-05 21:12:17 UTC | #89

Good catch!  Let's see what the proposed spam prevention mechanism will be and whether the timeline is accurate.  Could be that we could institute a temporary measure (as suggested by @Manu ) to reduce spamming until that feature is deployed.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-05 23:10:35 UTC | #90

Thank you for sharing this information!  We probably should have stated it in the original post, but I really want to hear from Dfinity on this proposal as well as their future plans for spam prevention.  I have no interest in pushing forward any proposal that is a non starter from the Dfinity perspective or conflicts with current roadmaps.  Whatever this proposal turns out to be, if anything, it will be shaped from feedback we hear in this deliberation that seems like the highest probability of success from both an effectiveness and an feasibility perspective.  That includes information that is shared by Dfinity about their roadmaps.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-06 10:29:29 UTC | #91

This proposal doesn’t prevent anyone from selecting Followees after a reset.  It just forces people to make an intentional decision on a Followee if they want voting rewards.

If a reset of All Topics Except Governance does occur, there is no longer a driver to submit low quality governance proposals because voting rewards will already be the max possible for anyone who reconfigures (e.g. active participants).  Submitting a governance proposal will not increase rewards for voters at the expense of non voters of governance topics.  This is because there will no longer be a lot of neurons that have a Followee configured for All Topics but not for Governance.  Everyone will be configured for both or neither.

I do think a reset cadence is something that is worth considering.  It’s an act of reconfirming your Followee selections.  If forces the staker to take an action of intent and it probably causes public known neurons to work harder to educate the community.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-04-06 07:39:05 UTC | #92

Since Dfinity anticipated the problem and plans to fix it, I propose to trust them on the timeline and on the solution. Once their solution's efficiency experienced, we will be able to change things if it is not enough, but for right now, let us just trust them.

If Dfinity can't explain what their solution is yet, it does not mean that we have to set a temporary fix. We could not deduce of their lack of time to explain their coming solution to us, that their solution is not enough efficient or not enough fast. If they have located the solution at this place on the roadmap, it is because they had the big picture and where thinking that we could afford spam during first months. Se, let us not be more royalist than the king. I fully trust them. By wanting to do things by ourselves and by our rhythm, even when Dfinity has a plan about it, we could get some counterproductive effects.

I would not want us to be more in a hurry than Dfinity. They monitor the IC ecosystem more than we are, at least currently, so if they estimated that we could afford months with spam proposals, we can. So, in my case, I will trust them and won't try to go faster than them.

Thank you @plsak, for having caught our attention on this initial plan.

-------------------------

I agree, but Dfinity has asked many times in the past for the community to get involved by making proposals on things the community finds important.  It has been said many times in social media by Diego and others, and never more clearly than on episode 28 of the Internet Computer Weekly podcast when Arthur Falls interviewed @jwiegley and @diegop.  If nothing else, I’m sure the discussion here and the thread that @justmythoughts started can serve as a source of ideas that can be considered.  It seems preferable though to shape those ideas further into an actionable plan(s) in a collaborative way.  At the end of the day, there is no motion proposal regarding NNS code changes that can be executed by the community.  Hence, it makes the most sense to try to engage dfinity in the discussion during deliberation in order to ensure that the proposal is feasible and doesn’t conflict with something they already have planned.  I think this is what they want based on feedback they have given to the community in the past.

There is no need to change the voting mechanism for NNs, because everyone should be responsible for their actions. If they care about the benefits generated by voting, they will participate in voting. It will eventually equalize everyone's income so that there will be no junk proposals. When the time is ripe, we will increase the reward of high-quality proposals and limit the time of launching high-quality proposals. This can effectively solve this problem.

I do think a reset cadence is something that is worth considering. It’s an act of reconfirming your Followee selections. If forces the staker to take an action of intent and it probably causes public known neurons to work harder to educate the community.

I wouldn't mind confirming once in a while my selection for a followee. Like I said on another occasion, I might get to a point where, for example, ICPMN doesn't push forward the same values as mine, so I would change my preference anyway.

A proposal must succeed in 7 phases in order to be available for voting
1. The proposer
2. Advisor.
3.  Developer or developers who are responsible for the execution of the proposal
4. The above must participate in DAOs with clear aims and purposes
5. They must first submit their proposal for voting in their DAO. If it succeeds then go to next phase
6. The proposal will be discussed and get verified on a prevote period. If it passes then phase 7
7. Proposal is ready. 

The voters who votes opposite the result are not rewarded.

The DAO which submits the succeeded proposals will be paid into cycles. The voters into icp

A voting history must exist not only for the proposals but for the proposers too.

I don’t think it’s widely recognized, but dfinity didn’t vote with conviction on any governance proposals until late February 2022.  This is because their vote would end any governance proposal immediately by way of absolute majority when virtually all voting power in the NNS would be triggered by their vote.  This went unnoticed by almost everyone simply because it had negligible impact to voting rewards.  The change that happened in late February is that Dfinity *started* voting on governance proposals.

Your action to follow a neuron that was participating in governance was the intended outcome of the implementation of changes from proposal 34485.  I would argue those changes were highly successful because we went from approx 6% voting power participation in governance proposals to approx 45% voting power participation in governance.  This includes dfinity foundation now being *able* to participate in governance proposals.

I agree with your assessment that the voting reward weights creates incentives for spamming governance proposals at this time.  Those proposal weights also quickly produced greater decentralization of NNS governance, which I think is a greater good.  There are going to be solutions to the spamming problems.  Ideally it would be done without reversing progress toward decentralized governance.

Governance is about direction and control of something, in this case to improve decentralization of the NNS by increased voter participation in governance.

More directly you are pointing to those who are less informed, less qualified and therefore less likely to vote, just lazy or don’t care as long as you make me rich.

You then point out the best method to punish people is through monetary penalties for investing and by calling them names.

The word followers to me means someone who supports and admires others.

There are no bad organizations, just bad people working there who, as pointed out by many of the replies, take advantage of those less informed. While you blame the followers it's because of the leaders we have the problems. The answer to the last proposal was to reward the qualified and punish the followers. Which I think is less decentralized by rewarding the problem makers in the first place.

In a business structure you have many levels of participants that all work together otherwise the whole concept may not exist.

Most organizations reward their customers which are followers but you want to penalize them.

How about we give each person one vote, make it easier for the followers to understand and participate without more rewards to some and penalties to everyone else. 

It’s like the many replies here, run through all the paragraphs, remove the duplications and you will most likely end up with a much smaller document with the main points of concern as most is off topic.

I am a follower and see that you are being disrespectful of my support and admiration of the project. But I support the organization's ideas, not the bad actors who criticize me and my investment of time and money.

I see this proposal as no better than the leading 5 top tech companies making changes to reward themself while they themself see they have created a problem of leaders having power over those here.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and offering critique.  You have made fair points and I highly respect your opinions.  Please note that I do not want people to get fewer rewards.  The goal is higher participation in governance.  In my ideal scenario everyone would make intentional choices about the configuration of their neuron for both the Governance topic and the All Topics Except Governance “catch all”.  ICP tokenomics are intended to incentivize participation in governance, so the objective is to create conditions in which we get as close to full participation as possible.  I recognize and respect that everyone will not agree, which is fair.

I appreciate your response. I like the banter and yes you are right about your intentions and I have written a response about this subject before which was not approved to be viewed. I felt it made some good points that where not brought up here but it didn't contain a solution to higher Governance Participation. 

To be involved in staking you would think that most of those not participating have some knowledge of what they are doing, even a follower like me knows the difficulties in setting up and knowing the steps must have some knowledge of what this is all about and maybe ask the people who do participate on this forum with a message
