How about we give each person one vote

and what would be your suggestion to accomplishing this??

I would think a even playing field and Democracy. As I understand it there are many who have more than one vote and could have unfair advantage but this is off topic.

In my opinion there is no NNS issue here, if everyone configured their neuron to follow others that actively vote or actively vote themselves then this would be just the way things would go. If someone wants to burn ICP for dumb proposals, then he should go ahead. It's a costly "attack" to sustain after all. 

I'm against increasing the amount of ICP that need to be deposited to be able to create a proposal or changing smth. about the proposal mechanism in general. It's complex enough as it is.

To my understanding this problem comes from dfinity 
1) changing the reward weight for governance proposals significantly
2) changing the nns "all" topic to "all except governance"
3) abstaining from voting on governance proposals for a while
4) not promoting those changes and their effects enough. I already mentioned this with @diegop , dfinity has a huge outreach via mail, telegram, their website, this forum, twitter etc. Why is there no combined educational effort to get this info out there? To reach people that are not lurking in this forum?

So instead of changing the way things work right now for the nns, (they work great imo) dfinity has to educate people about those changes. 

Those "spam" proposals only work as long as a major part of the voting power is not voting on governance. In an ideal world even a deposit of one ICP for creating a proposal would always lead to a net loss. Those "spam" proposals show the economic incentive to make sure you're voting on every proposal, it's not a flaw in the system.

This proposal as currently written above will not be pursued further.  Based on community feedback in this deliberation, it has been revised and posted in a new forum topic linked below.

It does not conflict with regular confirmation of neuron followers and should perhaps be presented as a follow-up proposal
