I just updated the DFX SDK from version 0.13.1 to version 0.15.1, and now whenever I attempt to call the ```dfx build``` function on the ```ICP``` network, I get the following error message:

```Failed while trying to build all canisters.
  Failed while trying to build all canisters in the canister pool.
    Failed to build dependencies graph for canister pool.
      Failed to get dependencies for canister 'default'.
        Failed to create <Type>CanisterInfo for canister 'default'.
          `main` attribute is required on Motoko canisters in dfx.json
```

does anyone know what breaking change I may be encountering and how I could resolve it?

I can't find any relevant breaking changes in our [changelog](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) (search for `!:` to find all the breaking changes). Can you show the dfx.json entry for `default`? I suspect there's something up with that

I resolved it. I had some dead code that was breaking things. I removed it

I meet the same problem, how do you solve it?
```
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed to build all canisters.
    Failed while trying to build all canisters.
      The build step failed for canister 'by6od-j4aaa-aaaaa-qaadq-cai' (root_fetch) with an embedded error: Failed to build Rust canister 'root_fetch'.: Failed to create <Type>CanisterInfo for canister 'root_fetch'.: No package `fetch/root_fetch` found
```

How do you define the `root_fetch` canister in dfx.json? and where is the entry point (main .mo file, Cargo.toml, or whatever you use) located?

I change the canister type from “rust” to “custom”, and i solve the problem.
