   i have register my domain domainfixkkkkk.com to the boundary node successfully,which showed `{"name":"domainfixkkkkk.com","canister":"3syhx-xiaaa-aaaap-qbmdq-cai","state":"Available"}`. However when i load the domainfixkkkkk in my browser,it can not load it.I managed my domain on cloudflare which are proxing for me.so I dont know if the reason from cloudflare or anything others.
this is the link to download ic-domains:
3syhx-xiaaa-aaaap-qbmdq-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains

agree with you; you have correctly set up `/.well-known/ic-domains`, and if the status is "Available," it should work. Before I forward your issue, considering that you mentioned using Cloudflare, would you like to give the settings I recommended in Juno's documentation a try? Disabling one of these Cloudflare flags might maybe resolve the issue.

Can you maybe also share a screenshot of your DNS entries? That way I can compare with mine as I also use Cloudflare.

Thanks for the details. Well, agree maybe that's not the issue but it does not work so maybe worth a try? At least it's what I do, I disable the proxy and other flag as described in Juno's doc.

YES,i disable the Universal SSL,disable the dnssec(just like below),turn the ssl/tls encryption mode off,but i got another issue. ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH in edge and chrome.
