Long ago I took classes on javascript but never really kept up with it.

I think ICP has the power to host the future and I want to entrust my dreams too it while getting back into writing code.

My issue is I worry I dont have any ideas to work towards... I think others might feel the same. 

So - What can we build on ICP. Let's imagine the future together by helping one another brainstorm.

The biggest issues I have right now are

* All the streaming services I pay for now try to show me advertisements and never have anything I actually want to watch
* Social media is spying on me and using my data against my will.
* Big tech is censoring the type of media I want too consume and punishing me for my desires
