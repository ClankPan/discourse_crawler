I am following this https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup and i am using github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/defi and when I ran `make install` I got
```rs
Error: Failed while trying to build all canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to build all canisters.

Stdout:

````
I also replaced `src/ledger/ledger.did` and `src/ledger/ledger.wasm` with the ones that I got from ]here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup#step-3--get-a-pre-built-ledger-canister-module-and-candid-interface-files)

Now I am getting another error related to calling `dfx deploy ledger --argument '(record ` it says ` failed to decode call arguments: Custom(Fail to decode argument 0 from`
> Blockquote

Also how the command should be?
````
dfx deploy ledger --argument "(record {
minting_account = \"${MINT_ACC}\";
  initial_values = vec { record { \"${LEDGER_ACC}\"; record { e8s = 100_000_000_000 } } };
  transaction_window = ????;
  max_message_size_bytes = ???;
  archive_options = ???;
  send_whitelist = ??;
})"`

The first error could be because you didn't fetch submodules. Can you try `git submodule update --init`?

I'm looking into the second error. It's discussed over here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/problem-insalling-internet-identity-in-local-setup/20417

I'm struggling to reproduce the second error. Do you have clearer instructions how to reproduce? You can also put URLs into the wasm and candid fields in dfx.json


I got the deployment argument to work with `--argument "(variant {Init = record {minting_account = record {owner = principal  \"aaaaa-aa\"}; initial_balances = vec {};token_symbol=\"arst\";  send_whitelist = vec {}; transfer_fee=1920193; metadata = vec {}; archive_options = record {num_blocks_to_archive = 98274; trigger_threshold = 2984; controller_id = principal \"aaaaa-aa\"}; token_name = \"areist\"}})"`. I just got the types right, I didn't check for any reasonable logic since I was just testing installation
