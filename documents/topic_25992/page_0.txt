When we install NNS extension on dfx 0.15.2, we get an outdated version of II. This version of II does not allow alternative origins with the `icp0.io` domain.

A custom build of II wasm from latest release and manual deploy to dfx fixes the issue, but it would be nice to have it in the NNS extension :grimacing:

I'm with you. I already reported it on the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-nns-install-dapps-outdated/25012), I also forwarded the information to the team multiple times spread on many months. There's not much more I can do unfortunately. It seems like no one who can do anything about it really cares that much, unless there is a reason why, it seems to be at best an ultra low priority. I guess it will just be updated some day.
