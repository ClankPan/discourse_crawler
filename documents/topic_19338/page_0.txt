Hello fellow community members,

I hope this post finds you all in good spirits. I wanted to take a moment to share some important news with you all regarding our self-custody wallet decision to deprecate support for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

As you know, we have been providing support for ICP in our wallet for quite some time, as the *very first* Self-Custody Wallet for ICP, and the *only* self custody wallet on the market that offers Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ICP across iOS, Android, and Chrome. However, we have recently been experiencing an increase in customer support requests related to ICP transactions and integrations. Our bootstrapped team has been working tirelessly to address these concerns, but the complexity and unique nature of the ICP ecosystem have made it increasingly challenging to resolve issues promptly and efficiently.

Moreover, we have been seeking assistance from the ICP Foundation for over a year now, but unfortunately, the support we've received has been insufficient to help us maintain and debug the ICP-related features of our wallet. The lack of support from the foundation has left us with limited resources to provide the level of service that our users have come to expect from us, and since early 2022 we have shifted focus to supporting the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems.

After much consideration, we have made the difficult decision to deprecate support for the Internet Computer Protocol in our self-custody wallet. This decision was not taken lightly, and we understand that it will impact some of our users who have been utilizing ICP within our wallet. Our primary goal has always been to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly experience for our customers, and we believe that this decision aligns with those values.

Over the next few weeks, we will be phasing out ICP support in our wallet (all existing wallets will be still have access, but new users will no longer have a default ICP wallet created). We strongly recommend users who hold ICP tokens within our wallet to transfer their tokens to another wallet or exchange that continues to support ICP. We will provide detailed instructions and assistance to ensure a smooth transition for all affected users.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and thank you for your understanding. We will continue to support and improve our wallet with a focus on the most widely used and supported blockchain protocols, ensuring that our users enjoy the best possible experience.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to our support team, who will be more than happy to assist you.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding.

Best regards,
Sukh
