Happy Friday ICPeople! [Proposal 130986 ](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=130986)to upgrade the NNS dapp just went live, please consider voting. :ballot_box:

We have noticed that some NNS dapp accounts that have a large number of empty neurons experienced issues when loading. This proposal introduces a change where empty neurons are no longer loaded. Note, that this change means that the ICP transaction history displayed in the Tokens page will no longer categorise transactions as "Top-up Neuron" for transactions that target neurons that are now empty. "Top-up Neuron" transactions targeting neurons that still contain ICP will be unaffected.

## Change Log

### Added

* Make neurons table sortable on desktop and mobile.

### Changed

* Change neuron ID column title to "Neurons".
* Excluded non-displayed empty neurons when loading neurons.
* Transactions to neuron accounts are now displayed as "Sent" instead of "Staked" or "Top-up neuron" if the neuron is no longer displayed because it's disbursed or merged.
* Change the color of the settings icon on the tokens table.

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the [nns-dapp repo](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp):

```
git fetch  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout "2cea96e44b10dfa29f4b7a32926df5b4de859fb3"
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main && echo "OK" || echo "Commit is not on main branch!"
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm.gz
```

You may also want to verify the canister arguments. In the proposal they are binary, which is not very readable. Docker provides both binary and text formats and you can verify that the text format corresponds to the binary `arg_hex` field in the proposal.

```
cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did
didc encode "$(cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did)"
```

The CodeGov project completed reviews for the proposal and voted to adopt it. You can find details on [OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/168083459961697538699863191526193241390/112) 
At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.

As a side note @chepreghy with the upcoming changes to proposal topics in [Refine NNS proposal topics](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/refine-nns-proposals-topics/32125) can you confirm that since NNS dapp (and II) do not fall into the new Protocol Canister Management, will not be **incentivised** to be reviewd as per [Grants for voting](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/grants-for-voting-neurons/32721). Thank you.

> can you confirm that since NNS dapp (and II) do not fall into the new Protocol Canister Management

This is correct. I still think that these canisters are both very important, also for the security of the IC, as they are probably what most users use to interact with the NNS. But we have to start with some topics and they do not fall in the "Protocol Canister Management" topic.
