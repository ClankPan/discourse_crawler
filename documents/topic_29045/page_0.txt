error during build:
Error: 
You installed esbuild for another platform than the one you're currently using.
This won't work because esbuild is written with native code and needs to
install a platform-specific binary executable.

Specifically the "@esbuild/darwin-arm64" package is present but this platform
needs the "@esbuild/darwin-x64" package instead. People often get into this
situation by installing esbuild with npm running inside of Rosetta 2 and then
trying to use it with node running outside of Rosetta 2, or vice versa (Rosetta
2 is Apple's on-the-fly x86_64-to-arm64 translation service).

If you are installing with npm, you can try ensuring that both npm and node are
not running under Rosetta 2 and then reinstalling esbuild. This likely involves
changing how you installed npm and/or node. For example, installing node with
the universal installer here should work: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Or
you could consider using yarn instead of npm which has built-in support for
installing a package on multiple platforms simultaneously.

If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both "arm64" and "x64"
in your ".yarnrc.yml" file using the "supportedArchitectures" feature:
https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures
Keep in mind that this means multiple copies of esbuild will be present.

Another alternative is to use the "esbuild-wasm" package instead, which works
the same way on all platforms. But it comes with a heavy performance cost and
can sometimes be 10x slower than the "esbuild" package, so you may also not
want to do that.

You installed esbuild for another platform than the one you’re currently using.
This won’t work because esbuild is written with native code and needs to
install a platform-specific binary executable.

If you are installing with npm, you can try ensuring that both npm and node are

changing how you installed npm and/or node. For example, installing node with
the universal installer here should work: [Node.js — Download Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Or
you could consider using yarn instead of npm which has built-in support for

Does this not help your issue? seems like this might be running on an Apple arm chip?

Thanks for reply yes I tried but it didnt worked

I've been encountering this occasionally too - particularly with CI. Try:

```
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

And you might want to do `npm update` for good measure

Thanks for the reply I tried your suggestions but the problem remains the same.

I can't really do anything further to troubleshoot with what you've shared

-------------------------

rahulaauji-30 | 2024-04-10 12:19:06 UTC | #7
