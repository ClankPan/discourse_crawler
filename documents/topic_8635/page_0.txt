## Summary

Are you a bot or a person? That is difficult to ascertain from across the Internet – but often essential. For instance, social media platforms provide more meaningful interactions if the content is provided by real humans, decentralized governance processes benefit from power being distributed more evenly across many voters, and the bootstrapping of token economies becomes fairer if tokens can be distributed evenly to individuals. All of the above are highly relevant for the IC, which hosts multiple social networks, provides decentralized governance processes, and allows for the tokenization of the dapp services that run on it. But the IC is not only a beneficiary of thwarting bots - it can also provide the solution!

Virtual people parties, coordinated by the Internet Computer, establish the personhood of otherwise pseudonymous identities. In a virtual people party, a small group of users validates each others’ personhood in a process that is fast, easy, and anonymous! For the time of the party, users provide a deposit of 1 ICP which can be withdrawn after the party is complete. During the party, which only takes a few minutes, users are divided into small groups and meet in a special video-chat application on mobile phones. But, unlike a typical video call, users do not show their faces or reveal their identity. Instead, users prove their personhood by directing the camera at the environment and reacting appropriately with camera movements to the requests of other users. At the same time, the video stream of the environment serves to validate the user’s location. This ensures that no user can participate in multiple groups simultaneously.

There will have be iterations through which we expand the set of people who can participate more and more. Let us see what works first and then iterate. For example, the first limitation will be that everyone has to speak the same language (English). Then we can iterate and introduce more languages and group people of the same language together.

So regarding disabilities, yes, it requires speaking and hearing. But that can also be replaced by on-screen written instructions. Just not in the first iteration.

Nobody is supposed to show their face, only the surroundings. The app will use the outward facing camera, not the selfie camera. If someone doesn't do that (show surroundings) then the others can immediately vote "deny" and once a majority has voted then the prover's stream will immediately end. We could improve this behavior by introducing another button that allows each individual to mute any stream immediately without having to wait for a voting majority.

I think this is a fantastic idea and is definitely needed at this time.  I think it should be pursued as soon as possible, so I really like the timeline that has been proposed.

Is this going to be incorporated into the NNS in some way where it can be known by the governance canister and ledger canister that specific neurons have been validated at the people party?  Will the people party validation apply to a single neuron or multiple neurons.  Will the people party validation apply by Principle ID or by internet identity?  I’d like to know more about what specifically will be validated on the back end at the people party.

I’d like to know more about what specifically will be validated on the back end at the people party.

A user that is validated will be able to designate a neuron that will receive a voting power boost. The NNS will obtain the ids of those designated neurons from the people party backend canister. Our current plan is to have each validated user designate _one_ neuron to receive the boost.
The validation applies per principal. The people party canister is independent of Internet Identity; of course, Internet Identity can be used to authenticate toward the people party canister. But there is no reason why other authentication methods would not work.
The backend actually does not validate a lot – it coordinates. The validation will be performed by other users in the same group, which vote on each participant. The backend canister does the tally. I hope to give a few more details in the 1-pager (may become a 2-pager) that I am just writing.

wpb | 2021-11-17 13:23:23 UTC | #12

This is great.  Thank you for the clarification.  There is a downside to only boosting one neuron per person that affects me and I’m sure many others.  Very soon after genesis I decided to set up two neurons and stake them equally because I wanted one to go to each of my kids some day.  Now I kind of wish this was a single neuron.  There has been previous discussion about being able to merge neurons and/or split neurons, but that is not available yet.  I just wish there were a way to address this issue if it turns out that I am not able to get full benefit of people parties due to my decision to stake multiple neurons in the early days.

Anyway, thanks for working on people parties.  I’m looking forward to learning more and can’t wait to participate.

The boost will be additive, in that it will give an additional x "virtual" ICP worth of voting power for some amount of time. The boosted neuron will receive increased rewards for that time. But you can spawn those rewards any time and use them to top up the other neuron – I think it will not be hard to make both neurons equal through this mechanism.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-11-17 14:17:16 UTC | #14

If you are going to have this feature it would be nice to have a merge/split neuron feature in the NNS. I separated them out for family inheritance reasons, but if I could merge and split easily I wouldn't have to do this.  If I only get to boost one neuron I want all my #8yeargang neurons participating!

lastmjs | 2021-11-17 14:55:53 UTC | #15

Hmm...I'm interested to see the fuller explanation. Hopefully we'll all consider every possible way it could be gamed.

For example, what stops me from staking 100 ICP and overwhelming my own people party?

I suppose if the people parties all happen at one particular time, and the voting has to be unanimous, as long as one honest human is present, perhaps this could be mitigated.

But even in a simple attack, I could just stake 2 ICP and hold up two phones, especially if I end up getting into the same people party, I'll just wait my turn for each phone

Depositing more than 1 ICP does not give you any direct advantage.

Correct, all calls happen at the same time, and every user must be in a distinct location. Which means you could be able to join with two phones, but only one will show the expected locations, which should be detected by the verifiers on the call.

BenTaylor | 2021-11-17 16:34:31 UTC | #17

I've thought about this a fair amount and I've come around to the idea. Although I am slightly concerned that the proposal will dilute the returns of my 8-year neurons, I think that the value this could add to ICP is immense. First, if we do the people parties, the returns for holding a 1 ICP neuron--which I believe is the minimum--will be staggering. Because of those returns, millions of people could be incentivized to buy and stake 1 ICP and attend a people party to supercharge their neuron. That would lock away millions of ICP and provide constant demand for the token as more and more people try to supercharge a neuron. Second, if millions of people buy at least 1 ICP to stake and supercharge, millions of people will then have an incentive to use and grow the network. Moreover, those people would (by definition) already have an internet identity, so it would be seamless for them to join any upcoming dapps built on the platform. Finally, it could also help solve the "bot" problem that a lot of dapps face now.

-------------------------

quinto | 2021-11-17 16:43:58 UTC | #18

Am I the only one that gets worried every time the foundation steps into app building? I get it that NNS and Ledger, etc. are essential to the functioning of IC. But People Parties seems like it could be built by anybody in the community? Am I missing the point? Is there any essential feature here that cannot be tackled by the community?

I don't mean to sabotage this effort, but it can be seen as platform risk, not unlike what Microsoft/Apple/Google/Facebook/... does.

-------------------------

quinto | 2021-11-17 16:54:58 UTC | #19

Or maybe I shouldn't be worried, because so far only II is a semi-good quality app, and all the others are disappointing to say the least. If it turns out to be another nns.ic0.app, the community probably will just have a good laugh and move on.

The virtual people parties have some perks over in-person people parties. Virtual is a lot more accessible. Anyone can join, even if they are geographically isolated from other internet computer users or even if they are at a work or with family or at another commitment (just take a few minutes break at the time of the meeting). One of my questions is what radius will be used on the location sensor? I can imagine that in densely populated areas that if two+ people tried to verify who lived in the same high rise, they could both be disqualified. Maybe for now we could assume people are few enough and distributed enough, but as the internet computer gets more users over the years, the user location overlap could become an issue. Maybe at the party time those users just have to go to a less dense area? I don't think this location uniqueness requirement is a bad trade-off for now, but it is one that the proposed model makes.

One problem that I think gets addressed well with the proposed format is duplication. I think what @lastmjs is asking about is what stops a person from making 100 different accounts (via 100 ICP) and overloading their people party? I think this question assumes a local people party. But the advantage of the virtual method is that we have a (I assume) geographically randomly distributed people party since all of them happen at the same time. So a bad actor would have to have many of their bots picked out of a pool of all internet computer users into the same random group. The odds are just so poor that I don't think it's worth it. 

The other logistical trade is the universal time. For 1/3 of the world's time zones, the party will occur during obscure times when they would normally be asleep. It's a price we pay, but it might be a nice gesture to cycle the time of the party through time zones.

I'm also curious about the setup of not showing your face in the party. Is this to help against any sort of discrimination? Protect privacy? What if instead you have to just mimic various finger movements and/or foottaps or in extreme disability cases face movements. You could still preserve privacy while proving a bit more explicitly your humanity.  I think the possible concern now would be that a bot maker could still manipulate the phone using a setup of motors controlled remotely while listening remotely to the instructions for many bots in many locations. This hack wouldn't be trivial though, so this proposal is not a bad workaround for now.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-11-17 18:01:09 UTC | #21

Groups may eventually need to be organized by language (not just English default), but we would need to ensure a large enough user pool to assure that you couldn't game the system with a flood of bots in a poorly represented language.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-11-17 18:17:03 UTC | #22

I'm also curious to know the location check mechanism. If the video app is web app, hacking that location check I believe is trivial. I can simply set a breakpoint on the frontend and change the coordinates before sending them to the canister or to another user.

If an Android or iOS app is used, I think hacking the location check is more complicated, but still doable, especially if the source code to the application is available, easily allowing users to install locally modified binaries.

The only solution I see, which is still subject to side-channel attacks, is a secure hardware module that can sign location information generated from within the module. To my knowledge retail electronics do not have these types of modules in most phones or desktops/laptops.

Hello everyone! Here's the two-pager as promised. We really appreciate your feedback!

# Virtual people parties on the Internet Computer

## Goal

Determining whether supposed users are actual human beings benefits the Internet Computer ecosystem in multiple ways: For instance, social media platforms provide more meaningful interactions if the content is provided by real humans, decentralized governance processes benefit from power being distributed more evenly across many voters, and the bootstrapping of token economies becomes fairer if tokens can be distributed evenly to individuals.

Virtual people parties establish the personhood of otherwise pseudonymous identities. In a virtual people party, a small group of users validates each others’ personhood in a process that is fast, easy, and anonymous! Validated users may then achieve benefits such as increased voting power in the governance system or additional capabilities in social media dapps.

## Concept

Each people party event takes place at one specific point in time; there will be different events for users in different time zones. Users register for a people party by committing to a specific location that they will visit during the duration of the party. When the party begins, the people party dapp assigns all users into groups of 6 people each, and creates a shared video session for each group, as well as a random pseudonym for each user. In each session, the participants have to prove that they are at the location they committed to. The following process is performed for each user, one by one: One user (the “prover”) shows the video captured with their phone’s main camera (i.e., they never show their face, only their surroundings) and reacts to requests from other users (the “verifiers”). The verifiers approve or deny validation depending on whether they are convinced that the prover showed them a live view of the committed location.

To ensure that one user can only participate in one group, it is required that each user must join from a distinct location. To disincentivize bots from registering with the people party canister, each user must deposit 1 ICP for the duration of the party; this deposit can be withdrawn after the party is over and if the user does not want to participate in subsequent events.

## Benefits

People parties and validated personhood benefits different parts of the IC ecosystem:

* Validated users receive increased voting power and thereby increased voting rewards. Dapps running on the IC, such as social network platforms, may provide extended capabilities to accounts held by validated users.
* Dapps on the IC can differentiate between humans and (potential) bots, enabling them to prioritize content created by real humans over bots.
* Decentralization is improved by providing additional voting power to validated persons, compared with a purely stake-based distribution. Allowing validated persons to act as pseudonymous node providers will also improve decentralization on the infrastructure layer.

## Implementation

The core component is the “people party” canister smart contract that coordinates the people parties and tracks the results. The canister allows users to register for a given party while committing to a location (ensuring that the locations of different users are sufficiently far apart) and to join a group for the party they registered for (ensuring a random assignment of users to groups). The canister orchestrates the calls, determining the order in which the users validate each other’s claims, and counts the votes. The canister keeps track of which users have been validated successfully, and allows the user to share the information about the successful validation with other dapps. The canister also informs the NNS about the neurons that are supposed to be boosted.

The frontend of the people party dapp is served by the canister into the user’s web browser. It uses WebRTC to transmit the video between the client devices.

As most users will be on mobile networks, STUN and TURN servers will be needed to relay traffic. Those servers will initially be hosted by the DFINITY Foundation, but note that they do not need to be trusted as all traffic routed through them is end-to-end encrypted in WebRTC.

## Risks and mitigation

There are multiple risks associated with the people party concept.

* Registration by bots: As long as not too many bots are registered, those will end up in validation calls with real users. At least in the beginning, we consider it unlikely that bots will successfully masquerade as an actual person; of course, we will have to improve the validation process over time for this to remain true. So those bots will not be validated. Registering many bots is disincentivized by the ICP deposit; this can even be made more effective by potentially slashing a fraction in the case the validation of a user failed. The risk of being attacked by bots will have to be re-evaluated over time.
* Insufficient participation: If too few real users participate, the people party system will not provide the expected benefit in improving decentralization of the IC, and low participation will also make it easier for bots to undermine the system. To mitigate this risk, we have to advertise the concept to an as-large-as-possible user base, and incentivize continuous involvement by providing sufficient rewards (such as the voting power boost).
* Inappropriate content shown in video by malicious users: This is hard to prevent entirely, since the video streams are sent end-to-end encrypted between end devices. The prover’s streaming will stop after sufficiently many verifiers have voted. If this turns out to be a problem, we can provide a button to quickly hide a video that shows inappropriate content.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-11-17 19:41:45 UTC | #24

How will users prove to others' their location? Is that up to each of the individuals in the people party?

For example, if I live in San Francisco, should I point my camera at a known landmark? I suppose that would do it. But what if I live in an obscure place with no notable landmarks or buildings? And being too specific with the location would remove anonymity.

This somehow evokes fond memories of the GPG key signing parties of the 2000nds:

Indeed, it could. And granted: ideally, it should. There are some aspects where it isn't just a usual dapp – namely where it starts interacting with the NNS the neuron boosting and – hopefully – for allowing pseudonymous but personhood-validated node providers; namely, where the people parties are improving decentralization of the IC itself. But even that should eventually not be sacred ground – when the entire codebase has become truly open source.

In our current development version we provide the verifiers with the video on top and a street view on the bottom of the screen. (And we only allow registrations where street view is available.)

I think your solution is a good temporary solution, however that does not prevent malicious actors from putting offensive content on the video stream to simply shock the other users. I think this is a great draft idea! I can't wait to see how it turns out!

By the way, I've been digging into the design with @bob11, and we're feeling pretty good about it. It won't be 100% perfect, but I think it will massively cut down on bot activity.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-11-17 21:57:12 UTC | #33

I think that's a really clever idea to use Google street view with a live video feed from a prover as proof of their humanity.

We will need to choose locations wisely because who knows if it will be inclement weather on the day in question. It will be interesting to see if extreme weather or other dangerous circumstances (tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, unrest, etc.) end up disrupting your ability to be at a location. It would be smart to allow users to select their location close enough to the day that they could have an approximate weather forecast.

If people really want two verifications, they could still do it by setting up on either side of a time zone border and being in one party on the east side and then jump west a bit and be in another one an hour later. But that's the trade off and it doesn't seem like a bad one to make.

Three questions: 
1) with the parties divided into time zones, is there a set party time and date being proposed too, or do that time zone's users vote on it? Could be a non-trivial concern in the case of inflexible schedules.
2) what is the mechanism by which location conflict is resolved and how close is too close?
3) what is on the list of "allowable" requests? It seems like requesting the prover to show themselves to the camera isn't allowed, but, for example, is asking the prover to say something out loud off limits?

Overall great design though and let's stop those bots!

Good question, but realistically most of the connections will be going through a TURN relay – it seems on most mobile networks direct point-to-point connection between the devices are not properly supported. And that _probably_ (although I would have to check) means that the SDP data contains the IP address of the TURN relay not the one of the end device.

In the current design: only indirectly by voting on the deployment of the people party canister. (We plan to make that controlled through the NNS, because ultimately the NNS depends on that canister for correctness of the neuron boosting.) But this is really only the first instance. We may have a more flexible mechanism in the future.

[quote]
2. what is the mechanism by which location conflict is resolved and how close is too close?
[/quote]

First come first serve – but that's during the registration phase, so if you register half an hour in advance that will give you ample time to go to a suitable location. We did not define the exact threshold for "too close" yet. We were thinking about something like a few hundred meters.

[quote]
3. what is on the list of “allowable” requests? It seems like requesting the prover to show themselves to the camera isn’t allowed, but, for example, is asking the prover to say something out loud off limits?
[/quote]

That is a great question and also one that we love to get more opinions on. So far we've been planning for the verifiers to anyway _ask_ the prover to do X or Y, so we're not really planning to hide the voice. But I expect usual requests to be of the type "move left" or "show me the street sign" or "can you move the camera upward". But as I said: it would be great to get your ideas on what should be acceptable and how much we need to protect for privacy. (In the end, that seems to be subjective.)

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-11-17 22:45:09 UTC | #36

As far as gaming the system goes, I think one big threat that I can see right now is that some time zones have very low populations such as the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (see this [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/9j4238/total_population_per_time_zone/)). Someone could take any number of bots and put them in GMT-2:00 or GMT-11:00 and probably take over those people parties. Perhaps we say your time zone needs to have at least 1 or 5 million people or it gets combined with neighboring ones, just to make sure enough real people will be there at the people parties.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2021-11-18 01:00:31 UTC | #37

Yes, exactly like this! :smiley: 

But, additionally, there could be a slash mechanic, by which unvalidated partiers lose part of their 1 ICP stake. Disincentivizing any actions other than the intended partying.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-11-18 02:55:44 UTC | #38

1 ICP for a large portion of the world is a  large sum of money that is out of reach for many.

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-11-18 05:33:51 UTC | #39

I think 1 ICP is reasonable since first they will get it refunded and second how can they boost their voting rewards if they don’t have the minimum to spawn a neuron?
I am in favor of slashing since this will also minimize the bots overall.
A question I have regarding the public API that this canister will offer to other dapps to query, is it already defined? Or do we have a rough idea how it would look like?

-------------------------

I assume there will be multiple instances of these people parties, right, and someone eager can take part in multiple installments, so in total earnings multiple “proofs of peoplehood”?

And once your principal is known to be peoplehoody, it could (in theory) be traded and accumulated, right?

So its more a proof of “past human effort” than “this principal right now is a district human”?

Correct, but so is satisfying the technical requirements that we explicitly or implicitly impose. As @timo wrote above in his answer to the question of how we support people with disabilities: we have to start somewhere, and should become more inclusive over time.

A question I have regarding the public API that this canister will offer to other dapps to query, is it already defined? Or do we have a rough idea how it would look like?
[/quote]

There is no specification yet, but I would expect the flow to look as follows:
- The application canister sends the user via browser to a specific endpoint on the people party canister (passing the canister that requests the verification and the user's principal on that canister),
- the people party front end sends an ingress message (using the user's principal on the people party canister as caller) to the application canister – that ingress message contains the user's principal on the application canister,
- the application canister queries the people-party canister on whether the caller of that method is indeed a validated person.

That flow provides some level of control to the user. It does achieve a basic level of privacy, although different dapps with which the user uses the personhood validation will have some linkability.

I assume there will be multiple instances of these people parties, right, and someone eager can take part in multiple installments, so in total earnings multiple “proofs of peoplehood”?

And once your principal is known to be peoplehoody, it could (in theory) be traded and accumulated, right?

So its more a proof of “past human effort” than “this principal right now is a district human”?
[/quote]

There will be events at a regular cadence, maybe every two weeks. Users can participate in each of those. The validation also wouldn't be forever, it would probably expire after a few month.

So: yes, it's clearly not a perfect mechanism. Some people may be able to participate for twice for one series of events since they are in different time zones. And you can pay other people to participate or get validated and then sell your II. What we aim to prevent is larger scale attacks where one person gets validated for, I don't know, 10 or more.

You are right. But you can tweak incentives to make it closer to “one distinct human”. Let’s say in your next installment you have the choice to either participate with the same principal again or with a fresh principal. If your “score” grows faster than linear with multiple participations of the same principal then people are incentivized to do that rather than creating a fresh second principal.

Let’s say first participant gives you 1 point, second participation 2 additional points, 3rd participation 3 additional points, etc.

There should be a cap of course. Say it caps out after 5 parties at 1+2+3+4+5=15 points. In the presence of a cap you also need a decay so that it is always better to keep participating with the same principal rather than starting a fresh one with 1 point. For example, you can say if you miss out on a party then you lose the points that you got from the party before. Here, if you miss the 6th party then you lose the 5 points from the 5th party and are back to 10 points.

what is on the list of “allowable” requests? It seems like requesting the prover to show themselves to the camera isn’t allowed, but, for example, is asking the prover to say something out loud off limits?
[/quote]

This is a really important question. To answer it we have to be clear what we want the prover to prove and that is that the prover is _currently_ at the _claimed location_. So for example, it shouldn't be possible to prerecord a video at that location with a special 360 degree camera and then write a program that takes the recording and converts it in real time into a stream that satisfies the requests. For example, say the requests were "move you camera right, left, up, down". Then one challenge is to have voice recognition that understands the requests. The other challenge is to cut a small selected view out of the 360 degree recording and then moving that selected view around inside the larger available image.

I would not like to rely on the first challenge because in the future we might want to move away from challenges by voice. Maybe for privacy reasons so that no one has to reveal their voice. Or to avoid exclusion because of disabilities. So let's assume for now that the requests are in writing on the screen and machine understandable. We must then focus on the second challenge. Selecting a small image out of large image even in real time seems trivial. The type of requests that prevent using a pre-recording in this way is to _interact_ with your environment. So requests like "turn right, walk a few steps" that change the perspective relative to objects are better.

I think the possible concern now would be that a bot maker could still manipulate the phone using a setup of motors controlled remotely while listening remotely to the instructions for many bots in many locations. This hack wouldn’t be trivial though, so this proposal is not a bad workaround for now.
[/quote]

This illustrates an important point about what we are actually proving (and what we are not proving). An attacker can of course build a physical device, place it at the location at the time, and reply to the challenges through remote control. But the emphasis here is on _physical_. It has to be a device that is able to interact with its environment and is physically present at the location at the time. If you can design the device, manufacture it in numbers, deliver all your devices to different locations and all that cheaper than hiring a human to go there for you then we can accept that you have gamed the system.

In summary, the take-away is that we should focus on proving time, location and presence. It is not important that the requests can _only_ be answered by humans. The challenges don't have the same purpose as captchas.

rubenhorne | 2021-11-18 18:41:35 UTC | #51

One question that we could address more explicitly is how much benefit in voting rewards do we offer for participating in people parties? Is it a max 1.5x multiplier? 2.0x? 1.25x? 1.1x? We have seen discussion too about how participating multiple times should reflect in what fraction of the available rewards you get too. The answer will probably reflect a balance between the benefits of verifying personhood and the costs of additional ICP inflation.

[/quote]

We are planning to make it additive, as in some _x_ ICP in addition to the stake in the neuron. A multiplier would again benefit the big holders more than the small ones, so it would not help improving decentralization. We could choose _x_ around 20-ish ICPs, so if you hold a neuron with 100 ICP your voting power would increase to 120 ICP, if you hold 1 ICP it would be 21 ICP. And you should receive that boost for every successful participation in a people party, for a limited amount of time (some months).

All these parameters can of course be updated through proposals, so in the end the community should decide on what values are considered suitable.

To your point on linkability, I think that comes from Step 2, where the PP can sends the local Principal of the user to the dApp can; allowing the dApp can to store the PP Principal, and compare against other dApp registrars in a side-channel.

If I'm correct, this would be mitigated if the PP can holds a "verification ledger" of addresses, that appends a new {address, Principal} mapping for every Step 1 call. Then pass that newly created address to the dApp can to validate against, instead of the PP Principal. Once the validation is completed, the entry is cleared and the dApp can label that local Principal as "human" in any way they please, with any timeout they please.

I think that would get rid of the linkability, as long as the PP can validation ledger is not logged or queryable at any point.

The verification flow "is user X a validated person" will be available to any dapp on the IC. There is actually nothing specific to DFINITY in the canister, in particular DFINITY will have no privileges that other parties on the IC do not have.

There will be one special case, which is the interaction between the NNS and the people party canister for implementing neuron boosting. But that also is not special to DFINITY in any way, since the NNS is the decentralized governance system of the IC.

@diegop one suggestion for future proposals would be to add some additional info about the proposal’s impact to current projects. I noticed this proposal said the ETA was December so I’m not sure how this would impact ETH integration but perhaps it just needs to be stated more clearly?

**Macro**: I agree with the general point (making a clear explanation of opportunity costs and trade-offs). 

**Micro**: In this particular case, the ETH integration is not affected as it is different people and skillsets (as far as I know there is no overlap of people). The ETH integration is behind the BTC and Threshold ECDSA projects. At first glance, those projects could be considered "blocking for ETH integration",  but it is my understanding that a higher level truth is that they are enabling ETH integration since a lot of the work will be leveraged.

How will you treat users that do not yet stake in the NNS? I for example can't do that yet, due to unclear taxation rules revolving around staking. Tax law does not quite evolve as fast as one would hope. Once cleared I will start to stake, but as of now, I can't. If I get verified at the people party/parties held in the future one would hope/expect to reap the benefits of this as well. E.g. could I boost my future neuron at a later time or will there be a "best before date" to boost a neuron? Primarily, at this point in time, I just want to get verified to be able to use the full spectrum of all services I have been/will be involved with on the IC.

Good idea. Interacting with the environment is needed. Maybe not in the first party but soon, so it is good to start thinking about how this interaction can look like. I was thinking before of writing a number that is suggested by others in the group with chalk on the floor or on a wall. That doesn't work very well when it's raining though. So using a coin is much better. But if it is a given that a coin is involved in the challenge then what unpredictable randomness is left? Is it where the coin is supposed to be placed?

What we have to make sure with the challenges is that the videos cannot be pre-recorded.

-------------------------

scruwd | 2021-11-25 20:59:59 UTC | #71

First I was mainly thinking about placing it at a possibly awkward position in the surroundings. But it could be more then just placement (like flipping, spinning, balancing on the side, showing parts close to the camera etc.).  More then one coin/object would add even more possibilities like patterns to lay out etc. so even higher percentage of unforeseeable interactions.

saikatdas0790 | 2021-11-26 17:07:33 UTC | #72

I have a different scenario that I'm thinking about which I'm not sure could be serviced in this case. 

As an individual using Internet Identity, I have 3 identities I have created. They are:
- a secret one - primarily to be used for holding my ICP long term as well as any NFTs that I purchase. Basically my wallet
- a regular one - primarily to be used for interacting with social apps where I provide contact info in the dApp and is not anonymous. Basically like my email ID or my public Twitter account
- an anonymous one - this would primarily be for trying out new dApps whose reputation is not yet known and this II is considered a low risk, replaceable identity in case something goes wrong

Now, with people parties, I imagine most social apps would want to provide additional benefits to verified principals and hence I should verify the 2nd principal. But I would also want the voting boost for my 1st principal to maximise staking return. But I wouldn't want to connect my secret II with social apps on the IC. 

Any thoughts on the above?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-11-27 00:40:27 UTC | #73

I have a similar setup. 
For me, I do not plan to expose the secret one for any boosting because the boosting is minimal and for a limited time in relation to my balance.  Also I will not expose my secret one to any other wallet ( except NNS dapp and that's also because of legacy issues).

 All NFTs , I will buy from my public address.

I think the security problem of Internet Identity should be solved before people parties being set up, otherwise, a lot of people like @mparikh, @saikatdas0790, me, won't take the risk of using their main Internet Identity, and won't have patience to create another Internet Identity, what it is very bad for massive adoption. 

Everybody should claim the Internet Identity seedphrase can't be suppressible or changeable without having to enter the seedphrase in the first place. This risk of seeing one's Internet identity and its associated staked neuron lost forever is insufferable. None whale wants to take such a risk ! It has to be corrected ASAP. I already talked about this several times, but no one among @Dfinity or Dev seems preoccupied by this eminent lack of security whereas users are ! Without this, no massive adoption.

Very good question. I expect the integration to work in a different way so that you don't even have to make that choice: You can use any principal for the personhood validation, even an unrelated 4th principal. Then for each dapp you get to boost or otherwise obtain some privilege in that dapp. What that boost or privilege is is entirely up to the dapp. The most common use will that the dapp allows exactly one of its user accounts, identified by one principal, to be flagged as being associated with a person. But it does not matter if the principal used by the dapp is created with an II or not. And if it is created with II then it does not matter which II. So in summary, in your scenario, you can use a 4th II to establish personhood and then boost *all* of your other 3 IIs, just for use with different dapps (not two IIs with the same dapp).

On a completely different note, just because you bring up using multiple IIs: You have to see each II as a separate _security domain_ and you only use multiple IIs if you have multiple security domains. Here, by "security domain" I mean the security of the weakest device on which you use the II and the stake of the highest valued asset that you are controlling with that II. For example, say you have one II (#1) which you use on all devices including ones that you don't protect very well and on all browsers, regardless of how secure they are. Say you have a second II (#2) which you only use on a dedicated well-protected device and in the browser that you think has highest safety. The II #1 you use for low-stake social media accounts and the II #2 you use as a hot wallet with some ICP. 

You have to separate your IIs based on how save you consider the browser(s) in which you start a session with that II and how much value you are controlling with the II. It is not about how much you trust the dapp! That is irrelevant. The dapp cannot "steal" your II and steal any value outside of the dapp itself.

Your concern with the security that you raise is legitimate. Since you opened a separate thread for it I will respond there. But whatever the conclusion there it should not be blocking people parties. As I explained in a response to [saikatdas0790](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/saikatdas0790), the principals or IIs used to establish personhood are unrelated to the ones receiving the boost. So there already is enough room to configure different security domains if you need them.

That's exactly the part I don't understand. Please read my response to [saikatdas0790](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/saikatdas0790)'s question. If the principals are unrelated to each other then what exactly is the concern? You are not putting any high-stake II at risk here.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-29 09:35:48 UTC | #81

Cause I won't take the risk of using my Internet Identity with my phone, and the phone seems to be the way chosen to prove personhood.

For this too : "Now, with people parties, I imagine most social apps would want to provide additional benefits to verified principals and hence I should verify the 2nd principal. But I would also want the voting boost for my 1st principal to maximise staking return. But I wouldn’t want to connect my secret II with social apps on the IC." Cause this social dapp, to be efficiently and fluidily used, have to be uses with phone. So I won't have any use of people parties eventually. Too risky. And if it is to me, I am sure it is for a lot of people : at least all investors.

-------------------------

timo | 2021-11-29 09:36:19 UTC | #82

I think you haven't seen my response then. In short: just create a different II for the personhood stuff and you'll be fine. The II used in the personhood app is **unrelated** to all other IIs that you use.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-29 10:07:43 UTC | #83

Yes, I red it, but if I prove my personhood with an II to which I did not attach any neuron with staked ICP, I don't have any interest for doing this anymore. And as soon we have to create different Identities tu use dApp, there is a big problem. The main purpose of II was have an Identity to do everything, not multniplicate anymore account like we do on web2 with by entering email adress and create multiple password etc. if we have to remember several Internet Identities and are not able to gather our staked icp with app uses to increase the yield, the target is missed, and people will flee away. So I should to create another identity to accumulate benefits, like better percentages for my staked icp, but would not have icp with the identity I would use.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-11-30 01:49:03 UTC | #84

As I understand it, the people parties are not planning to give a multiplier to your II's neuron. Instead they give you a fixed amount of ICP (someone proposed 20 ICP) to an II for participating. This bonus should be transferable to your main neuron on a more secret II. So you can still pocket the same bonus on anothet II and not lose out on the rewards while keeping your secret II off your phone.

-------------------------

timo | 2021-11-30 09:15:11 UTC | #85

Yes, that understanding is correct. You participate in a people party with an II and then get to boost an arbitrary neuron of your choice. It doesn't even have to be yours because there is no way to check that. Keep in mind that II is an entirely optional feature across the IC. There are dapps that integrate with II and there are dapps that don't. If you establish personhood then you should be able to use it in any dapp, regardless whether that dapp integrates with II or not. That's why the II that you use to participate in the people party is completed unrelated to the dapp in which you take advantage of your personhood.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-30 12:33:21 UTC | #86

wpb | 2021-12-03 11:30:00 UTC | #88

@guillaumestols 
I don’t think the outcome of a people party is to give away ICP.  I think it is a way to boost voting power by the equivalent of 20 ICP.  If the neuron has 1 ICP, it would have voting power as though it has 21 ICP.  If the neuron has 1000 ICP, it would have voting power as though it has 1021 ICP.  Neuron configuration of age bonus and dissolve delay bonus still apply to the voting power calculation.  Voting reward distribution proportional to voting power still applies as well.  The voting reward yield would appear large for small neurons, but the absolute amount of voting reward would be equal for everyone (assuming equal neuron configuration).  But kind of to your point, if you stake 1 ICP in a neuron then you will get ICP rewards much faster if you attend a people party than if you do not, but you still have to stake that 1 ICP with dissolve delay of 6 months to 8 years, you still have to vote on governance decisions, and you still have to wait for that neuron to accumulate 1 ICP in rewards before you can disperse the rewards.  IMHO it is a clever way to attract lots of people for little effort and introduce them into the IC governance system, but you are not going to get paid $800 for taking pictures..  At least that is how I understand at this time.

My concern was about the ability to transfer it.
If this voting power increase can be transferred to a "secret" identity, then it is a kind of "tradable security". What would prevent someone to write a contract that buys this 20 ICP increase for say 10 ICP ?
As far as I understood it, having a  proof of humanity is a way to mitigate the wealth of cartels acting in the shadow for their own interest. Even with this proof of humanity, it is hard to mitigate "on chain vote buying" (see https://hackingdistributed.com/2018/07/02/on-chain-vote-buying/), especially if II are anonymous. I think it would be far better to increase the voting power each time the user identifies (eg. each time you identify, you get voting_power = current_voting_power*1.1, also each time you vote you get your voting power increased, each time you miss to identify you get you power decreased, clamped of course to a minimum). This would create a kind of  "proof of involvement" that, in my opinion, would make more sense.
And attracting lots of people in IC governance... Isnt the right to vote in a fair DAO is reward in itself ?

I haven’t fully understood the discussion about transferring the people party boost benefit among neurons yet, so I’ll have to go back and study up on it a bit more.

It would be helpful to see a clarification from DF of whether this a distribution of real (exchangeable) 20 ICP into the selected neuron that is being boosted or if the 20 ICP is just an ICP equivalent that has an additive voting reward benefit. 

I think one of the goals of people parties is to benefit every individual participant equally no matter how much ICP is staked.  Hence, the bonus can’t be a multiple of voting power or staked ICP.  It must be an addition term in the voting power calculation.

-------------------------

guillaumestols | 2021-12-03 16:27:40 UTC | #91

Yes, the formula is oversimplistic, however, I think that for things to be really fair the way I see it, the proof of humanity should increase a coefficient (clamped with a min and a max) and the amount of stake per II should be clamped to a max too. 
So if you staked 10000 ICP (assuming this is the max allowed) but have a proof of involvement with a coef of 0.01(the min), you will have less voting power (100) than somebody with a coef of 1.00 (the max) and 150 ICP at stake (150).

The idea is, in my understanding, that it is additive and the ICP is "borrowed" as described by @wpb (you get a boost in voting power equivalent to having added N ICP but don't actually get to disburse N ICP).

What is also desirable is rewarding a "proof of involvement" as mentioned by @guillaumestols, i.e. participating in many parties without gap, for example in the way described in this post above: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/people-parties-community-proposal/8635/47?u=timo

However, I think vote buying can never be prevented and that isn't the goal of PPs. The (narrow) goal is to distribute "boosts" evenly. If you decide to sell your "boost" then fine. The wider goal of PP is of course that you use your personhood attestation is many more dapps than just the NNS.

Great idea.. ICP become more and more useful tech in true decentralise space.

guillaumestols | 2021-12-08 17:20:49 UTC | #94

Hello Timo, yes I missed your post #47 where you described the increasing reward. However, the thing being additive gives very little weight to the proof of involvement compared to the proof of stake.
The reward being tradable will even lower the interest of that thing, ultimately bringing unrecommendable folks (rembember tg: where is my airdrop ? -> Dfinity SCAM, token price drops -> Dfinity SCAMMM, where is my t-shirt ? -> Dfinity SCAM)...

-------------------------

timo | 2021-12-09 14:55:57 UTC | #95

I didn't mean its tradable. Or in which way do you consider it so?

Regarding folks writing something on a forum with higher legitimacy after a personhood validation: that is unrelated to stake anyway, so the additive vs multiplicative nature doesn't make a difference here.

And I can always pay someone to participate in a people party for me. That is unavoidable. I wouldn't worry about something that can't be avoided anyway.

guillaumestols | 2021-12-09 15:09:46 UTC | #96

you said

> If you decide to sell your “boost” then fine.

, from my understanding if you can sell the boost, it becomes something that can be traded.

> And I can always pay someone to participate in a people party for me. That is unavoidable. I wouldn’t worry about something that can’t be avoided anyway.

This can be mitigated by asking to prove that you are in possession of the key that gives you access to all your assets, so someone would look twice before giving it to a random that will pretend to be him.
[In the post above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/people-parties-community-proposal/8635/57), I posted a proposal for a mechanism that would, I think, allow it.
But as far as I understand, this personhood proof is not in the top priorities, and the usecases are not well defined, so lets not spend too much time on it until this changes ;-).

Well, selling it once is not the same as trading. I meant you obtain the personhood at principal P and when you first get it then you assign it (usually) your neuron with id N. Neuron N happens to be controlled by principal Q. Of course, here neuron N could be controlled by someone else than you but that doesn't mean that that person can sell the boost onwards.

In principle I agree with you that it would be better if neuron N was also controlled by P and if that could be enforced. I just see a whole lot of technical complications with that, security risks, inflexibility for users, contradiction to privacy features of II, etc. that I think it's not worth trying. In this context also note that personhood should also be usable by all other dapps, not only the NNS. And you don't want trackability of users there.

I don't fully understand the mechanism of PoH but validating a person by camera sounds very odd to me. It’s so easy to fake it, and I believe some deepfake app or API would be available soon, maybe sooner than PoH is available. There should be a smarter way to approach this. I reject the proposal.

Zane | 2021-12-21 12:48:54 UTC | #99

Read this article, it explains in detail how PoH would work: https://medium.com/dfinity/ultimate-decentralization-using-virtual-people-parties-that-deliver-proof-of-personhood-at-de575522c80

@diegop I have tried to message the same on Reddit.

Let's let aside 'proof of personhood' and focus on proof of uniqueness at least within 1 dApp.

If we have a canister that contains two data elements. 1 a simple 'list' encrypted video/audio clips of a person saying enough to get their voice recognition. 2. the app name.  If the canister can scan a potential new user's voice and face against what has already been registered, we should be able to completely avoid duplication on the NNS and in any DAPP that is properly configured to work with that canister.

The canister can be written to by any dapp but the only data that can come out is a binary 'unique or new user' or 'duplicate user'.

Appreciate any feedback you can offer!

-------------------------

BIKETACO | 2022-04-20 04:51:28 UTC | #101

Most importantly, no audio video is every correlated to an actual particular account.  The clip remains completely anonymous and is only associated with the app that sent it.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-05 15:33:45 UTC | #102

Sorry I’m just seeing this. Let me ping the folks working on people parties to give a more appropriate feedback to your thoughts

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2022-05-05 16:41:50 UTC | #103

If I understand you correctly, you describe a canister that implements a uniqueness verification service. Any app can add a claimed new user to the canister. Then the canister checks the face and voice samples against all the registered ones to find a potential duplicate in which case it returns "duplicate". In the case no match is found, it registers the new samples and returns "unique" as response. The data set (i.e., biometrics) is managed per app, i.e., any app can have this service.

Would this be a correct understanding of what you want to achieve?

This sounds interesting and is worth further thought. We will respond back after having discussed this in the team.

B.t.w., sorry for the late response, did not check the topic for some time.

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2022-05-06 11:39:38 UTC | #104

We had a discussion about your idea in the team. We do think that the idea could be pretty appealing to ensure uniqueness. One could even go beyond the level of the dApp and do it for the user's II anchor, thus applying to any dApp immediately.

However, there are the following points that may make the approach hard:
* Acceptance: People might not like their face and voice sample to be stored. One could use employ additional safeguards and not store the samples, but only a vector of biometric properties that do not allow for a direct reconstruction of the original input, but allow for matching.
* Technical challenges: Doing the detection of duplicates reliably is not an easy task as we can only make use of Rust of C libraries as building blocks and likely would need to implement much of the matching technology on top.

Definitely something to keep in mind and further evaluate. Thanks a lot for this suggestion, in my view this is very valuable input!

Could DIDs verified by trusted institutions be used to augment people parties? Such as what Fractal provides. Fractal serves as an ID verifier providing ID document verification, liveness checks, face matches, source-of-wealth verification, AML checks, and proof of address checks. DIDs remain in the hands of the user who can choose what relevant information to share with which party, and be able to revoke access to the DID information at any time. You can create your own DID, or have a DID provider, such as Fractal, create one for you. Then, for verification, you turn to issuers (e.g. government, school, bank, and I guess the people party process) to provide claims against it. In addition, could people parties be implemented as DIDs as well where the people party event provides claims against the DID?
