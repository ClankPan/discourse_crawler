Please would there be any estimation when People Parties could go live?

I understand that BTC integration is first and delays can happen for countless reasons, but below statement is just a bit scary:

Just thought I'd ask about thoughts on the POH on eth using kleros by anyone in this. It seems like a forkble project. I'm actually curious as to why it hasnt been ported to ICP yet or even offered as a solution.

We have been facing some technical challenges, mainly a lack of stability on certain platforms, for our People Parties implementation for quite some time now and are evaluating alternative solutions for this. Concretely, we are evaluating to go with a native app for the iOS platform. A PoC for this is currently being implemented, but we have been facing delays because of staffing issues. We cannot give a concrete release time currently, but hope to resolve the staffing issues and get a team that can work on people parties for a substantial fraction of their time.

The approach you refer to requires full identification of people, i.e., goes beyond the PoH in terms of revealing information. In people parties, one would not need to put up a full profile, yet still be able to make a PoH. It's a zero-knowledge (or minimal-knowledge) PoH essentially where you are not identified with a profile.

I'm surprised you are going native iOS, given the existence of cross-platform frameworks like React Native and Flutter and the existence of agent-js and agent-dart.

Many users (myself included) use Android. It would also appear from the outside looking in that staffing React Native would be much easier than staffing native iOS.

The problem is related to WebRTC-specific problems, everything else works fine. WebRTC does not behave as expected on certain platforms and it has been impossible to find the reasons so far. This is independent of native development or framework use.

Ah interesting, that's surprising to hear...

I'm not sure this is still open to discussion, but I'd like to add some feedback here.

In summary: I think people parties addresses an important issue in crypto, DEFI and social networks. However, I dont think people parties are the best solution for most cases. There are, of course, many applications for it, however:

* what makes the internet easy to use and free is not to have such bureaucratic processes in place.
* I find it hard to see this working in practice. Do people get verified once, and then they are considered "real" forever? That would be easy to cheat. And if instead people have to keep being verified over and over, then it will become a hassle for most regular users, while still being something that is easily exploitable by people who really put their time into it for financial gains.
* I've read that Geo-location would/could be used to make sure people don't cheat the system. But that would just hinder adoption for people living in apartments, families with multiple members etc, while at the same time those who really want to cheat the system can simply put in the time to do it at different locations.

So in short: this seems to overly complicate things for legit users, while still not preventing bad actors to go through the ropes for financial gain.

It is one of those "punish the many for the mistakes of the few" approaches.

Also: There would be so many simpler methods of achieving greater results. So I dont see the benefit of increasing the complexity to the point of hurting adoption, for a worse result.

Please dont see this as FUD, I just want to see this project achieve greatness, and I am confident this is not the way. Is this discussion still going on anywhere else with more recent contributions?

People parties would be held occasionally, right? What’s to stop somebody from verifying themselves as a different person every time a people party happens? Maybe this has been answered

What if we just created the infrastructure to aid the process of verifying POH via organically forming associations. Let DApps decide which associations they're willing to trust. Let Associations vouch for one another. Let people decide who they want to be verified by.

BIKETACO | 2022-12-17 16:34:45 UTC | #116

Wanted to bump up this concept to see if the team is considering this path or if it should be proposed to the folks at ModClub or another team.  

I didn't see your delayed reply until today and had honestly given up hope.

To address hesitation about using the canister I think the best defense is in the code itself.  If a face/voice is not stored but only its 'uniqueness characteristics' then privacy issues would be contained.

-------------------------

BIKETACO | 2022-12-17 16:35:41 UTC | #117

Sorry this was in response to: If I understand you correctly, you describe a canister that implements a uniqueness verification service. Any app can add a claimed new user to the canister. Then the canister checks the face and voice samples against all the registered ones to find a potential duplicate in which case it returns “duplicate”. In the case no match is found, it registers the new samples and returns “unique” as response. The data set (i.e., biometrics) is managed per app, i.e., any app can have this service.

Would this be a correct understanding of what you want to achieve?

This sounds interesting and is worth further thought. We will respond back after having discussed this in the team.

B.t.w., sorry for the late response, did not check the topic for some time.

The boost will be additive, in that it will give an additional x “virtual” ICP worth of voting power for some amount of time. The boosted neuron will receive increased rewards for that time.
[/quote]

This logic is critical, which I think addresses my concerns. So whether a neuron has 1 ICP or 1 million ICP, that boost will be the same, since it is additive, not multiplicative. This is a good approach, since it is congruent with the one-person, one-vote concept that proof of personhood is intended to promote for certain votes. 

Second, the boost is only for a **limited amount of time**. This addresses my other concern about how to accomplish sybil-resistance when the same individual attends multiple people parties. I understand that these parties will all happen at exactly the same time worldwide (or close enough to make travel between time zones impossible during any time gap). However, new individuals are always coming on board to register their Internet Identity for the first time, existing Internet Identities may have been sick or otherwise unable to attend the original people party, etc. As a result, this will undoubtedly require multiple people parties on a periodic basis, perhaps once every quarter or year, to accommodate such situations. It is important that these multiple parties can't be exploited to multiply an individual's personhood status. So that's what the "limited amount of time" restriction should be able to accomplish.

Feel free to suggest an alternative. A lot of brilliant minds have put a lot of thought into this problem, and there really aren't any better alternatives to prove personhood. 

Given that the majority of social media posts are now from bots -- and this will only get worse with the recent breakthroughs in AI mimicking human discourse -- it is critical that some proof of personhood process exists while also allowing individuals to retain their cherished anonymity. It is even more important for DAO governance, which should have ZERO tolerance for sybil attacks and bots. It's just like showing up to vote in a democracy. If someone doesn't think it is worth it, then stay home and let the adults who really care about democracy vote on your behalf.

I like the "people party" initiative.

Could it be combined with an additional option for (people-party) verified users to vouch for the personhood of an unverified user?

This could require more than one voucher, and could include a restriction that people using this method cannot themselves act as vouchers for others.

I suppose, but those individuals should likely be in a lower class of verification, since this method does not appear to be as sibyl-resistant. More ideas are good, though.

[quote="erikblues, post:122, topic:8635"]
believe that is the correct path, but without people parties.

We already have verified users: the dApp developers themselves.

Those are the users that can create procedures inside their dApps to vouch for users (users can earn reputation points).
[/quote]
Your idea adds many layers of trust (of many dApp teams) instead of being trustless like people parties. Also, what's stopping someone from using a different user/account for each of several dApps and then using all those users to manipulate votes, conduct mass trolling, or whatever on one or more other dApps?

Finally, I don't think you understand how people parties would work. For example, they totally preserve anonymity, since they only prove personhood while still hiding one's real life identity. Also, they will only allow one user to show up in person at the appointed time, so it will not be possible to have 2 or "30" accounts show up in person at multiple places at the same exact time.

-------------------------

[quote="erikblues, post:124, topic:8635"]
but whats stopping someone of doing the exact same doing people parties?
[/quote]

Because it is only possible to be (and to prove) that you are in one place at a time, and validations would periodically expire. Also, incentives like vote boosting would exist, along with disincentives like temporarily depositing 1 ICP to validate.

[quote="erikblues, post:124, topic:8635"]
are you saying there will only be ONE people party per year? what stops someone from joining one today, and another one tomorrow, and a new one the next day, each time from a different account/device?
[/quote]
No, likely about once per month, and prior validations would periodically expire. Technically, it may be possible to have more than one personhood validation before some personhoods expire, but certainly not many. The point here is preventing all individuals from having a way to leverage any significant bot power, not necessarily closing every last loophole to acquiring multiple personhoods.

Also, this proof of personhood is only for dApps like the NNS or others that require it or incentivize it (via boosting). There would be no requirement for other dApps. As you said, they would be free to "create their own rules", and they could even ditch the whole Internet Identity for logins if they want. 

However, I would personally love to be able to filter out unproven persons if I am using a social media dApp on the IC. This does not mean unproven persons could not post. It just means that I could happily ignore them all if I want, which is currently not possible on sites like Twitter while still allowing everyone to remain anonymous. Keep in mind that 70%+ of all social media posts currently come from bots, per one estimate that I read. That means it would be more correct to call what we have now a cesspool of anti-social media.
