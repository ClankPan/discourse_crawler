I hacked [this little extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=motoko-lsp-client.motoko-lsp-client) together to get code completion and compiler warnings with the `dfx _language-service` command. 

This has been only tested on `0.5.2` and assumes your `dfx` binary lives in `/usr/local/bin/dfx` (this should be easy to fix). If you need to change the directory, use

* `which dfx` to get the correct path
*  open `~/.vscode/extensions/motoko-lsp-client.motoko-lsp-client-{the-current-version-of-the-extension}/client/out/extension.js`
* modify the path in line 12 to the output of `which dfx`
* safe the file and exit
* restart vscode

It also only works for projects with only **one** canister specified in `dfx.json` (but this shouldn't be to hard to fix). If you want realtime feedback from the server, not only when you manually save your file, go to 

* vscode settings
* `Files:AutoSave`
* set to `afterDelay`
* Tweak the `Files: Auto Save Delay` to your preferences. 

The [code](https://github.com/letmejustputthishere/motoko-lsp-extension) is open source, feel free to jump in! It is very heavily inspired from  [this.](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/lsp-sample)

**Note**: the `dfx _language-service` is not (afaik) officially supported yet. There will very likely be a way better client provided by dfinity itself which will render this obsolete. This is for people that don't want to wait :slight_smile: !

It would be great if anyone wants to collaborate on the two issues mentioned above! Enjoy

The path to dfx isnt hardcoded anymore! No need for ugly hacks :slight_smile: 
Make sure you [download the newest version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=motoko-lsp-client.motoko-lsp-client), there has also been a namechange to "motoko" instead of "motoko-lsp-client" (which was a bit long and hard to understand).

Hello @cryptoschindler!


Thank you for this extension!

I keep having the `Failed to locate dfx at dfx check that dfx is installed or try changing motoko.dfx in settings` error message even when I have only one canister.

I am currently working on the tutorials from the developer center, which are really great by the way. :heart_eyes:

For example, for this [`tutorial`](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/define-an-actor.html) so that everyone can have a simple context to look, the same error message shows up.

I tried to change the path as explained in your post, but I keep facing this issue.

Just for you to know, I am working with the Windows Subsystem for Linux to run `dfx` etc.

Have you faced this issue before?

Hi @atom 
There’s actually an official extension now, so Moritz ceased work on that one, you’ll find the official one here instead: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dfinity-foundation.vscode-motoko

When you open your projects in VScode, it’ll prompt you to choose a canister, make sure you select the canister containing your Motoko code, not the assets one, and you should be all set.

Hello @Ori !

Sorry for the inconvenience, I found out that the issue was because I didn't have the "Remote - WSL" extension installed in my Visual Studio Code IDE.

I should have following properly the instructions. :man_facepalming:

Thank you for your time!

No problem at all! Happy to help.
