Hi everyone,
I would like to create a dApp complete with frontend and backend, using Angular and Motoko.
I started by creating the project with the command
`dfx new project_name`
`npm install`
`dfx deploy`

All works fine also with `npm start`.

Now I have to do angular setup, so:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`
`cd src/`
here I delete the current project frontend folder, then
`ng new project_name_frontend` the same as the old one.
running `ng serve` all works correctly.
Now, I need to do `dfx deploy` wich does not work because it is looking for the index.js file into frontend folder. I create an empty index.js file in this folder.
Then, I modify the `dfx.json` file like this. I share with you also the project structure.

Using this configuration and running `dfx deploy` the result opening the canister is a white page.

I'm sure, I'm loosing some important steps. I can't understand where. 

I saw in previous forum questions, and can't find hint.
I also share my code https://github.com/looganxx/LandRegistry on the branch features/setupAngular
Thank you for your attention.

I found it after a long search. After some hacks, it works. Thank you!

Here's [my project](https://github.com/faragly/motokobootcamp2023-coreproject) for Motoko Bootcamp 2023 I did 2 weeks ago. I used Angular 15, maybe you will find something interesting there
