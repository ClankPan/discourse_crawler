Check today's news from USDC-launch-on-NEAR.

Why doesn't the community governance accelerate the deployment of stablecoins to the IC network? Public blockchains around the world are evolving more and more like the World Bank. If stablecoins backed by major institutions come to the IC network, it will attract a large number of potential users in the savings and wallet markets, and will also accelerate the popularization and application of the ii identity. With the completion of our Rosetta API interface in the near future, I think Dfinity should pay attention to this direction as soon as possible. I hope someone will lead to make some proposals about this, and I will actively vote in the NNS . Thanks

I totally agree with you. The dfinity foundation should allocate some resources to lead this kind of native stable things such as USDC, USDT, etc. Please do not just call we will be top 3 and never do the things the may help #ICP lead to that position.

-------------------------

Ajki | 2023-12-26 09:22:07 UTC | #3

I believe the issue stems from Dfinity's reluctance to finance integration. 
As far as I am aware, Circle demands a fee for native integration.

Furthermore, it's unclear why there's a strong preference for relying solely on the upcoming ckUSDC and ckUSDT. This approach seems questionable, especially when native integration is also viable.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2023-12-26 09:47:21 UTC | #4

Yes. I think you are right. 

I don't like ckUSDC and ckUSDT, if there is a stable coin in the ICP system, I will never use them, why I will not use ckUSDC and ckUSDT? since the fee of converting USDC (especially from ETH) is very expensive, that actually is an obstacle for using it. If there is a natively one, I will only keep the native one in the #ICP ecosystem which is very important for all the ICP ecosystem. As a big #ICP ecosystem, you have to have your own native USDC or USDT or maybe other USDx, You HAVE TO HAVE USDT AND USDC. If no, I believe #ICP ecosystem is more like a joke. 

We have to have ckETH and ckBTC, that's good, but I don't think we need ckUSDC and ckUSDT (that's bad for the #ecosystem, prove that you can't afford to introduce real USDT and USDC). We need native USDT and USDC rather than ckUSDT and ckUSDC. Please think more deeper about it, you will understand why.

An ecosystem that even do not have a native USDx, do you believe it? come on, you are not BTC and the transition fee is too high that almost cannot use it(since it is too slow to send).

It is weird that the dfinity foundation do not allocate resource to lead this native USDx thing. There are many public chains are competing with each other, no the time that only have #ETH and the USDx would take the initiative to get closer to #ETH.

One does not build a world computer without natively integrating established stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Strictly depending on other chains to provide it, is not a good idea.

I believe Gold DAO will be launching a token GLDT which is tied to gold backed dollars. This is specific to the ICP ecosystem.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-12-26 14:28:21 UTC | #7

This is correct, USDG will be the ICP native stablecoin (indeed ckUSDT and ckUSDC are on the way as well):

I too agree integration with native USDC and USDT merits attention and consideration. Sure ckUSDC and ckUSDT will serve the same purpose, but the native coins would just simply be better out of the gate by the metrics of gaining adoption faster and with less transitionary friction. 

Based on the roadmap proposed by Gold DAO USDG will eventually come to fruition , however you need to keep in mind this will be an experimental and brand new product, it needs significant liquidity locked up in collateralized debt vehicles by owners of GLDT to work, it could take years for people to warm up to it. And on their roadmap there isn't a clear timeline when they plan to introduce this. Creating the GLDT token itself is already a big undertaking and may take some time before USDG even begins to be worked on.. 

When it comes to stablecoins, people will prefer to use the ones they know and trust already. 

It may very well be a huge boon to gaining rapid adoption on the IC network if people have the option to use native USDC and USDT, which millions of people know and trust already. I think these ideas merit discussion and potential NNS proposals in due time

There is a native stablecoin on the internet-computer now: the CYCLES. 

The CYCLES are stable at 1-TRILLION-CYCLES = 1-XDR.

Mint yourself some CYCLES at the CYCLES-TRANSFER-STATION: https://cycles-transfer-station.com, look how it feels. Then trade your CYCLES back and forth at the [CTS-CYCLES-MARKET](https://cycles-transfer-station.com/#/market/trade/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai).

We never know this will succeed or not, as per the experience, most projects will fail, you must know this, and even this could succeed, it will take years at least. 

ckUSDT and ckUSDC seem more prove that #ICP doesn't have the ability to attract the native USDx to the #ICP ecosystem. When I use #ETH version USDT and USDC, I want to use in the #ETH ecosystem, not for the #ICP ecosystem! When I use #near version USDC, I want to use it in the #near ecosystem. When I use #tron version USDT, I want to use it in the #tron version ecosystem. 

**Can you believe that your target is on top 3, and you use the ckUSDT and ckUSDC from a top 10-50 ecosystem? I believe this will be more like a joke.**

But what you're asking for is for a native stable coin on the Internet computer, which is what GOLD DAO is offering. Sure their success is somewhat speculative but they have first mover advantage on this need for a native stable coin. I'm not saying that ckUSDT or ckUSDC is all that good of an idea either, I would prefer to just use the actual token itself as well instead of a chain key pair to a stable coin. Seems kinda silly to me. Again though, if what you're asking for is a stable coin native to ICP then you already have an answer to that which is GOLD DAO.

I honestly don't see anything wrong with that. For ICP to grow and become a strong project in the greater crypto sector, time > everything. Sure, we can use ckUSDC or ckUSDT now, or even bring the tokens themself over (which if I understand ICP, EVM, and chain key technology this is possible) but in the same sense that these tokens were built on Ethereum, and surely took time to become what they are today, ICP seeking to be in a similar position would need it's own stable coin and allow time for it to develop. Gives me more time to stack ICP and when people see that also within the ICP ecosystem is a non inflationary stablecoin, it just adds to the value when ICP's potential is fully realized.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-12-27 06:41:21 UTC | #13

When is that happening? We need a stable coin like yesterday. We cannot wait one more year to get stablecoins. Plus I am not too confident about using gold as a collateral to generate stablecoins since gold is liquid. If Dfinity needs to bribe circle then so be it.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-12-27 11:21:48 UTC | #14

I think that the USDG will take some time, but ckUSDT and ckUSDC should be just around the corner (first ckERC20 tokens to come):

You don’t get the point, many ppl don’t hold ckUSDT, ckUSDC, I will not hold it. I will only use it in the corresponding ecosystem. Using ckUSDx mean #ICP even do not have the ability to have the native one and will less attractive for ppl to join in the #ICP ecosystem.

Ajki | 2023-12-27 14:55:14 UTC | #17

Every significant blockchain have native USDC/ and their presence invariably brings net positive benefits.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-12-28 15:59:21 UTC | #18

I understand, my previous comment is about related info from last Global R&D meeting, but I feel there is other misunderstanding.

Basically the ETH integration will allow native USDT and USDC (with all advantages and disadvantages) - that is what the ICP ck* canister receives and holds (native BTC for ckBTC, native ETH for ckETH...), but the implementation is IMO up to DApps like DEXes etc (possibly https://twitter.com/HelixMarkets and https://twitter.com/sonic_ooo, among others, are planning such approach).

That means, once we have ckUSDT and ckUSDC (which are specific implementations of the ETH integration developed by DFINITY), DApps/projects/DAOs can (except developing own solutions) use similar/same procedures to handle native versions of the aforementioned tokens rather than wrapped ones... (but it might be slow, with gas etc, the main advantage of wrapped/ck* ones is being ICP native ICRC tokens)

-------------------------

Forreal | 2023-12-28 01:33:06 UTC | #19

The CK stablecoins provide a reasonable option for now, but high transaction fees to move them in and out of the Internet Computer ecosystem pose a significant drawback. Stablecoins from Base, Optimism, or Arbitrum that have very low transfer costs would be more ideal. Perhaps a bridge to an Ethereum Layer 2 chain could enable cheaper and faster transfers of stable assets to and from the Internet Computer.

I'm intrigued by the idea of leveraging Layer 2 networks or chains optimized for low transaction costs to improve stablecoin integration and usability on the Internet Computer. Reducing fees and friction for moving assets on and off the ICP network could open up more use cases and applications. What technical solutions or partnerships do you think would be most viable? I'm interested to hear additional thoughts on enabling seamless stablecoin adoption.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-12-28 11:45:27 UTC | #20

Thank you for the comment and suggestions @Forreal, I'll add below more screenshots of the integration plans (published by @dominicwilliams on X/Twitter).
I personally believe that during 2024 the situation with stablecoins on ICP will clarify a lot and in a few months time we'll be able to do much better estimation what/if more is needed.

Exactly. The reality is that native USDC will come to ICP in 2024. Very soon. 

First though, we’ll get ckUSDC.

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2023-12-29 06:59:01 UTC | #22

The biggest support for the blockchain ecosystem is stablecoin. In the entire blockchain world, besides BTC and ETH, the third largest market share is stablecoin, such as USDT, USDC, and DAI. The market value of these stablecoins combined far exceeds that of all other public blockchains and DAPPs. In the future, the market for stablecoins will only grow larger. Stablecoins and public blockchains will together challenge SWIFT to become the underlying network for global payments and the largest global capital trading market. Unfortunately, IC has no idea about the future global largest stablecoin market, and has no plans to introduce stablecoin issuers. They even think that stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC will come to the IC network to seek cooperation on their own. This is really commercial ignorance and dullness. Such a view lacks long-term marketing planning and also lacks respect for all IC users.

The foundation has more than 20% of the voting power in IC governance. I hope Dfinity can add stablecoin as a key work in the roadmap, so that the arrival of stablecoin can promote the prosperity of the ecosystem as soon as possible.

hankbrigham | 2023-12-30 02:46:34 UTC | #23

I think some are failing to realize how important UX is for blockchain applications. We won’t have widespread adoption if users have to pay a lot in fees or wait a long time for token transfers to finalize.

IMO, integration with Circle is the best option, but they charge $10,000,000 for that….

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-12-30 11:02:30 UTC | #24

ajismyid | 2023-12-30 14:39:39 UTC | #25

Just a curious question: 
Why choose USD as the stablecoin of choice compared to other safe-haven fiats like CHF? 

We know current US regulators are not crypto friendly. Choosing stablecoin based on underlying asset of a fiat that its government can rug anytime may not be wise. 

Why not choose CHF as the stablecoin? We know the Swiss government is more crypto-friendly and pro-freedom.

Sygnum Bank, one of ICP's validators, also already has DCHF. Why not make proposal to them to release its stablecoin version on ICP?

Robert_Hon | 2024-01-01 12:01:24 UTC | #27

I hope that the recent ICP price increase event will give Dfinity a new understanding. 

When the market position continues to rise, more users will pay attention to the chain, and more people will learn about various IC Dapp, which will also bring more and more developers to join IC. 

I hope Dfinity will actively promote the development of DeFi, lending, and stablecoins.

I support a native stablecoin (backed by fiat deposits) as well. This would give more confidence in the IC ecosystem.

-------------------------

BABYAROF | 2024-01-01 21:41:59 UTC | #29

With respect to your opinion... we too have been waiting for a long time to create a stable token.

But let's think about this more, even if it takes more and more time, the ICP community is not losing anything, if ICP is growing fast and unhindered, one reason is that we don't have a stable token yet.

If stable tokens like ckBTC and ckETH are created, that's great and a new path will be opened...

If we prioritize speed and fail to develop a truly secure stable token, we may experience irreparable leaks.

If USDT can be rebuilt like ckETH it would be great, otherwise if a native stable token is introduced we will no doubt come under the eyes of big banks and feds and of course they may challenge ICP.

I am patient, be patient too

-------------------------

Esty | 2024-01-02 05:34:25 UTC | #30

I think it makes perfect sense why USD would be the "first" stablecoin introduced to the IC ecosystem. It is currently, for better or worse, both the leading international settlement currency worldwide for commerce and traditional finance and the leading choice for currency denominated stablecoins in other crypto environments. 

This makes it the natural first choice to gain rapid adoption; it's what people are used to. A CHF pegged stable coin is a novel idea and certainly would have benefits, but I think we are a long way from that gaining widespread adoption.

I think the goal here should be minimizing barriers to entry, both for individuals and institutions looking to participate and utilize the IC protocol. For this reason, it would make sense to pursue USD pegged stablecoins as the first introduction and perhaps other currencies could be explored later.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-01-02 10:46:03 UTC | #31

While the USD may be a common choice for stablecoins, but in the crypto industry reality it is not used as international settlement, but the primary use is for protection against the downturn in fiat value. In this context, the Swiss Franc (CHF) stands out as a superior option due to its historical resilience and strength during economic downturns.

The Swiss Franc has consistently proven to be a stronger currency compared to other fiat currencies, including the USD. If the goal is to have a stablecoin backed by a fiat with a robust and reliable value, choosing the Swiss Franc over the USD becomes a logical choice.

The CHF is renowned and popular as a safe haven currency in the global investing world, particularly among financial institutions. Its stability during times of economic uncertainty makes it an attractive choice for individuals and institutions seeking a stablecoin that offers not only familiarity but also a track record of being a reliable store of value.

-------------------------

Esty | 2024-01-02 14:33:13 UTC | #32

I think what you are saying has validity. I think the most important issue here is getting the FIRST stablecoin into the ICP, whether that would be USD pegged or CHF pegged, personally I think USD would be the natural choice as a FIRST option. I see no reason we couldn't have many stablecoins in the future including those pegged to CHF, EUR, JPY, etc..

However I think this thread's main focus is on whether ckUSDT / ckUSDC is sufficient, or if it would make more sense to steer toward a native stablecoin integration as well.

Creating a new stable coin involves significant challenges including maintaining its stability, ensuring regulatory compliance, and establishing trust among users.
with the existence of well-established stable coin like USDC could mean that a new ICP stable coin would struggle to gain traction and provide sufficient added value to justify its existence.
Why create a new solution for something that already works....

Brale | 2024-01-30 23:30:27 UTC | #35

Based on the collective feedback, we're interested to understand if issuing an IC native, fiat-backed stablecoin would be supported by the community.

Brale is a regulated stablecoin issuer licensed in the United States. To date, we've issued stablecoins on nine blockchains with treasury reserves held with U.S. financial institutions audited by a third-party accounting firm. Brale supports on/off ramping for U.S. businesses with issued stablecoins supported by a number of on/off ramps, custodians, and liquidity providers.

An ICP partner organization is also able to earn a majority of program revenue from underlying treasury reserves which could be used to further invest in the stablecoin's growth.

As others mentioned, there are tradeoffs between new issuance and waiting for established stablecoins, but we would be able to support significantly reduced time to market for issuance of a regulated stablecoin if it's valuable.

Curious if you have any thoughts @Robert_Hon @daijianlin

Look at the blockchain market cap rankings, from the 9th to the 18th spots are communities with a massive number of users, it's the users and the large community that drive their market cap rankings, it's the multitude of users holding tokens that maintain the network's value! If we continue to lack a native stablecoin, how can we attract more users to ICP? Without a stablecoin, the IC network will find it challenging to create more influence. Let's not rely on ckUSDT anymore, can ckUSDT be used to pay for accommodation and food during travel? The travel business worldwide has long begun to support various USDT payments, yet our ICP network's native stablecoin is still nowhere to be seen!! Please, let's unite as a community and do something together to push for the arrival of a native stablecoin! Whether it's the CHF, the GBP, the EUR, or the US dollar, we need a native stablecoin for daily savings and payments!

Without a native stablecoin, dreaming of being in the top three in market cap is absurd and impossible. Please, let the Dfinity actively market, seek cooperation, engage with Tether or Circle, and invite more stablecoin issuing institutions to come to ICP as soon as possible.

I can confidently predict that with a native stablecoin, the East Asian community and Chinese communities worldwide will have at least tens of millions of users engaged in savings and payment circulation on ICP. Whether it's registering for ii, using NNS, or using OpenChat as a social and payment application, the user growth within two years will definitely exceed tens of millions!

Robert_Hon | 2024-03-06 01:21:37 UTC | #41

If we still lack a native stablecoin by 2024, people will sell off ICP and transfer their investment profits back to ETH for lending and savings. This is not a matter of safety but rather a matter of daily savings and convenient payment. The inefficient and risky promotion of a native stablecoin for ICP seriously affects all ICP users, including SNS development teams.

Native stablecoin and Rosetta API are equally important. I don't understand why these two significant needs are not included in the roadmap, to be executed in advance as important proposals for the community. Look at other blockchain projects, like SolChat for example. We are losing all first-mover advantages. When your technological advantages cannot be translated into user growth, what is the value of boasting about your technology?

I agree, the need for native stablecoins like USDC, USDT, etc is paramount, if only for the massive liquidity that it brings to the ecosystem. I am new to the ecosystem and one of the things that made me a believer was the fact that the community gets to decide on what is important. This seems to be of utmost importance judging from the responses in this thread. Why doesn't someone in the community create the proposal to bring in these stablecoins into the ecosystem? I am sure it will enjoy an overwhelming yes vote.

You have visited Dubai, Singapore, and Hong Kong many times. These places are home to a large number of old money and traditional financial institutions. However, you have failed to invite traditional capital to participate in the construction of the world's most advanced ICP net, and you have not made efforts to attract more stablecoin issuers. This is a manifestation of arrogance and prejudice. @dominicwilliams @Jan 

 It has been almost three years since the ICP mainnet went live, yet there is still no stablecoin available on the platform. This is a serious strategic mistake.

I urge you to be more humble. You should actively seek more extensive commercial cooperation, and respect the voices of investors and other holders. Otherwise, more SNS projects will fail in the future.

Yeah, (not only) in crypto, everything is `soon`, `right around the corner`, `few weeks`... And you're lucky if you get to see it ever.

Probably some marketing strategy. I'm not a fan of that, but I understand that if everyone else is doing it, you don't really have a choice. And if you look at other ecosystems, everyone else is doing it.

With DFINITY and ICP I feel encouraged and privileged that (most of) the promised features are actually being developed and are delivered, albeit sometimes later than originally anticipated.

Stablecoins don’t seem that important to me during the Bull market phase of the cycle. 
Any stablecoins on ETH can become “ck” when ETH integration phase 2 is completed this quarter. Just sounds like this thread is people trying to move an immovable wall. Stop beating a dead horse - sit back and relax crypto boys & girls. You will live a happier life if you stop bitching about things you can’t change or influence. 
Lol what’s the hurry? Let’s sell all our BTC and alt coins and put them in a stablecoin. Hehehe.

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2024-03-10 02:54:26 UTC | #56

According to CMC data, ICP’s market share in the entire blockchain is only about 0.26%

How does Dfinity increase market share? Rely on your advanced technology? If there is a lack of users, no matter how good the technology or the number of developers the entire community has, it will not be of any help. Where are our user base? Should we let developers and small entrepreneurs do their own marketing and find users? It is difficult for our developers and small entrepreneurs to compete with established communities such as Telegram, uni, aave, and Binance for users!

Only stablecoins are the best breakthrough, and stablecoins on the blockchain are what the world urgently needs.

ICP under ii management is far ahead of various blockchain wallets, plug-in wallets and various APP wallets in terms of savings and payments. Why should we bury our heads in the desert like ostriches to escape global competition? Looking for reputable stablecoin issuers around the world to work together to release original ecological stablecoins is no less than a war in the fiercely competitive blockchain market.

Native stablecoins coming to the ICP network have at least the following advantages:

1. Let ICP surpass PayPal and reach the leading position in global digital payment 3.0:
2. Allow more traditional savings to be moved to ICP in a decentralized manner, bringing huge liquidity and asset value to ICP;
3. Challenge the global SWIFT system and directly compete in the SWIFT currency market. This is the greatest progress in business civilization, unless some people are afraid of competition and face traditional financial power.
4. Completely increase the number of ICP users. A huge number of WEB2 users will accept ICP, learn and use ICP, thereby getting out of the narrow situation of only competing for users in the blockchain market with traditional blockchain communities such as ETH, SOL, and AVAX.
5. Completely increase the price of ICP, increase the market share of ICP, bring a positive impact to the SNS within the ecosystem, and release the liquidity and innovation capabilities of various enterprises.

After the development of ckBTC and ckETH, how many blockchain head assets will come to ICP? Please don’t deceive yourself. Those two to three hundred ckBTC are not as large as the number in a whale wallet. Just rely on the pitiful ck assets on the dashboard. How do you lead the rise of the ecosystem and face the market of other public blockchains compete? There is no shame in proactively seeking cooperation with stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers are better at handling legal issues and the business of on-chain assets. How can a community that cannot see the strengths and advantages of other companies lead the small and medium-sized enterprises in its own community? I hope someone from the Dfinity will face this problem soon! Don't be an ostrich! ! !

So do we have stablecoin now? How are we supposed to onboard web2 customers into ICP if we don't have stablecoin? The market of crypto native is small compared to onboarding new customers from web2 to web3

stepbro | 2024-03-18 00:00:56 UTC | #58

Well said 100% agreed I think using native usdc or ustd with open chat features like p2p swaps will be killer usecase

Through recent comments from other users in the community, I learned that perhaps stablecoins are a resource of political interest. As engineers who believe in logic and mathematical algorithms and believe that technological innovation drives social change, including Dfinity, these people may not have much social contact. Abilities can collaborate and communicate with power centers.

From today on, I will no longer make any comments on the native stablecoins on ICP.

DHemingway | 2024-04-27 12:18:31 UTC | #64

You must by the US government. Native USDC and native USDT on a blockchain allow the US govt to seize assets on ICP. Why do we need that - just keep using fiat crypto bro?

-------------------------

CLP | 2024-04-28 14:16:20 UTC | #65

Yes, supervision is a factor we pay close attention to, so CLP did not use US dollars or US dollar equivalents as collateral when designing, but used pure on-chain crypto assets such as BTC and ETH. This does not mean avoiding supervision, but minimizing interactions with off-chain as much as possible.

ICP is merely an unambitious public chain driven by a selfish minority of vested interest groups. It's a technical meme, and the leaders of this community never consider the interests of other SNS teams and individual investors.

Is 100 block confirmation really necessary for USDC conversion to CkUSDC? It seems excessive imo. It make the UX really bad.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-05-23 10:22:51 UTC | #70

The higher block confirmation required, in my opinion, is part of KYT process to ensure that the source of the deposited USDC does not come from problematic transactions. This helps reduce the risk that ckUSDC minted originates from problematic funds. I actually think it may be necessary to have a 24-hour equivalent block confirmation is needed for large USDC deposits before ckUSDC minted.

I see this is the ledger for the iTAL token: tofpc-yyaaa-aaaar-qafxa-cai
Is there also an index canister?

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-06-07 04:49:00 UTC | #75

This is the correct ledger. There is no index canister for now as it wasn't requested, would you like us to deploy an index for iTAL?

-------------------------

Severin | 2024-06-07 08:24:47 UTC | #76

An index is required for most DEXes and wallets to display the TX history. IMO you should add an index proactively even if you don't see demand yet

AlexTroshkin | 2024-06-10 00:58:24 UTC | #77

Why are stablecoins called stablecoins even though they are not stable in the slightest and are printed at a terrible rate by issuers? Are people fine with their share being constantly eroded? Fiatcoins would be a more appropriate name. Start setting prices in real stablecoins like Bitcoin already

Satoshis could be used for this imo, since 100,000,000 Satoshi = 1 Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin is volatile and majority of crypto space uses USD as a stable coin

ICP claims to be the world's best third-generation blockchain, yet it cannot seamlessly and efficiently integrate the stablecoin system into its network. Dom and Dfinity never prioritize infrastructure and are unwilling to listen to the voices of community users. This is extremely arrogant! The last business giant that perished due to arrogance was Windows Phone.

Who has made money in this bull market so far?

Firstly, definitely not the VCs. Most of the projects they've invested in haven't even started issuing tokens yet. Even for those with high FDV and low circulation, which the community criticizes, they only look profitable on paper. If there isn't an altcoin bull market coming up, when VCs unlock their tokens, a 90% drop wouldn't be surprising.

Secondly, it's not the retail investors. Most retail investors are trading memes, playing with altcoins, and opening contracts. While it's not completely impossible for them to make money, it's very rare, similar to winning the lottery.

From observation, those who have made money fall into the following categories:
1. **Bitcoin holders**. Holding Bitcoin means the world works for you. Around this time last year, it was $25,000, now it's $65,000, a massive profit. Reaching $100,000 within a year is highly likely, but most people don't see this kind of increase as appealing, so they don't make money from BTC, which is reasonable.
2. **Centralized exchanges**. Exchanges have always been at the top of the crypto food chain. The entire crypto circle essentially works for the exchanges. Of course, running an exchange also comes with huge risks, being constantly on the move, and facing regulatory threats. The risk-reward ratio is balanced here, which is fair.
3. **Tether and other CeFi platforms**. Tether made $4.7 billion in the first quarter, more than most exchanges. Strictly speaking, this money isn't entirely from the crypto circle. Additionally, some crypto financial service providers are quietly making substantial profits, like custodians and wealth management platforms. They provide good services to the crypto circle, so their earnings are reasonable.
4. **Some public chain/DeFi product teams**. DeFi products like Uniswap have a lot of traffic, and transaction fees don't go to token holders but mostly to the teams, resulting in significant income. The Base team, for instance, likely earns tens of millions of dollars from the Friendtech product alone. The Tron public chain earns massively from daily USDT transactions, with most profits going to the team. These projects don't rely on selling tokens to retail investors but on developing their business, similar to traditional internet businesses. They are the hope of the crypto circle and worth learning from. Especially with MakerDAO setting an example and Uniswap having a proposal to distribute dividends, these are the alphas of this bull market.
5. **High market cap projects primarily focused on selling tokens**. If they have already listed on CEXs, they have made a fortune this round. They don't need much revenue; some zk projects, for example, see only two or three active users after airdrops, but their market caps remain in the billions. Market makers happily help these teams sell tokens. Other highly controlled DeFi tokens or barely active GameFi tokens are similar. These toxic elements in the crypto circle constantly leech off the market. The teams behind these projects are accomplices making significant profits. It's laughable that recently someone on Twitter bragged about how much their manipulated project made; such spectacles are unique to the crypto circle.

There are others, like quantitative teams, making hard-earned money, but they won't be listed here. If anyone has more discoveries, feel free to comment and let me envy you. 

However, based on the above analysis, one could consider creating a "always profitable crypto portfolio," mainly holding targets from categories 1-4 and avoiding category 5.
