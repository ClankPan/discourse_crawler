I am developing a swap canister. We keep logs of the swaps but eventually we will run out of space to hold the swap logs. We would like to reuse the icrc1 archive canister. Is this fairly easy to achieve? I noticed that the append_blocks method simply takes an encoded blob so I'm thinking it should just be a case of adding the functions needed to interact with the archive canister on my swap canister? Do you have any recommendations for this?

As always, thanks :slight_smile:

bumping this. Do I have to roll my own or is there something in ic-ledger-types i can reuse and then essentially reuse the same archive wasm?

You could use this...if your canister if rust you may have to jump through some hoops to get the wasm into your project for deployment:

See https://github.com/PanIndustrial-Org/icrc3.mo/tree/main/src/archive for the archive actor.
