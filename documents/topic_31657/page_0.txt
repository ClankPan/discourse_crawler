Hi,

Im trying to understand the stake options in ICSwap in the SNS Beta section.

Where do we find information on APR% for each project/token.

I'm struggling to find any information on APR % differences for length of staking time (like ICP). 

Also where do i find charts on tokens like RICH within the ICP system?

In ICSwap i cant locate any upto date prices and charts?

Any help on either would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance
