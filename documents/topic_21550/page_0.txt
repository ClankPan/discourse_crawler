Hello everyone!.
I am glad to post my first topic.

As a Rust developer, I am learning about developing canister using Rust.
I am going to use NoSQL such as canDB.
But I can't find any examples about it.
Please help me where I can find solution.

@icme do you have any examples available?

Sure! Unfortunately, CanDB is not available in Rust, but from the Motoko side, the CanDB documentation is now on-chain and getting started tutorials can be found at [tutorial-basics/hello-candb](https://ykgs2-ziaaa-aaaak-qcfya-cai.icp0.io/docs/category/tutorial---basics).

CanDB is also available via [mops](https://mops.one/candb)

Hi, @borovan,
Thank you for your interesting.

Do you have any idea about canDB integration in Rust?
or do you have any example for it?
I will be grateful if you can share your idea/example.

Best Regard.
