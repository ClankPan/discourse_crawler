Project Highlight: Mapz is a blockchain-enabled navigation platform designed to enhance the driving experience for electric vehicle (EV) owners and general commuters. Our target users are individuals seeking reliable, real-time information on EV charging stations, traffic updates, and gas prices. Mapz addresses the need for accurate, user-verified navigation data and rewards community contributions, solving the common issues of outdated information and lack of incentive in traditional navigation systems

Web3 advantages: Mapz stands apart from traditional Web2 navigation apps by harnessing the power of blockchain for real-time, community-driven data verification and user incentivization. Unlike Web2 projects where user contributions are often unrecognized, Mapz rewards its community with blockchain-based incentives for their updates, ensuring data remains current and accurate. This integration of blockchain not only enhances trust and user engagement but also fosters a decentralized approach to navigation, setting Mapz apart from conventional, centrally controlled navigation systems.

How is it built: We have deployed our NFT navigator on ICP where users can navigate and look up information on our NFT land parcels. The EV search and price reporting app is currently hosted on Azure. We have integrated social sign-ins to the existing apps to set up a web3 wallet in the future. 

Internet Computer superpowers: ICP made is super simple and seamless to host our front-end in a decentralized manner at a fraction of the cost of web2 hosting services. 

Go-To-Market strategy: We are currently focused on getting EV users onto our platform to report their experience with EV charging stations as this is one of the biggest pain points for EV adoption. We are marketing our app on EV charging forums on various social media platforms. 

Status of the project: Our project is live in Beta and users are already reporting their experience with charging infrastructure. We have also planned a limited edition NFT collection for free to reward our most loyal users. 

Future plans: We will be expanding our EV charging app to Asia, South America and Europe next. Followed by Gas price & traffic incident reporting capabilities.

This is actually pretty cool. I don't have an electric car but I definitely would use it if the gas pricing ever become available in the United States. I support people using the internet computer in any capacity. It's really good to see people using it just for hosting front end.

It has been great seeing your journey throughout the year since we first met in the summer! Will you be at ETH San Francisco next year? Let's connect there.

We would love to hear any feedback that you have with using Azure vs. ICP, and how we can make things easier for you. 

In addition, you should look into adding [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/internet-identity/integrate-identity) as a seamless login option for your users.

I think that your biggest challenge is to keep contributors engaged and motivated to continue providing data. 

1. You can think of interesting rewards models that are only possible with web3. For example:

- Contributors can own an NFT of a land parcel.
- NFT land parcel owners can earn perks in that area such as EV charging, parking, toll discounts, car pool lane access, and additional rewards any time a car uses the EV charger that they update. By tying perks to the geographic area, owners are incentivized to purchase NFT land parcels near where they live. 
- Contributors are required to update EV station data daily or risk losing ownership of their NFT. Ideally, contributors are incentivized to not lose NFT ownership due to the rewards and perks that are close to their area. If they lose NFT ownership, they have to purchase another NFT land parcel is out of the way from their home or not even have access to the area. 

2. Have you thought about governance? You may want to explore launching an [SNS](https://internetcomputer.org/sns/faq) for any of these:

- Reward pool distribution
- Additional data / feature offerings (think of what happens when your users want a specific feature but you need contributors to agree to collect the data or support the feature)

Hope that helps!

Woohoo, your NFT navigator is hosted on Juno!!! :heart_eyes:

Would you like to add it to the [showcase](https://juno.build/showcase)?

Side note: It seems like the CSV data file (https://onzmk-taaaa-aaaal-acw4a-cai.icp0.io/data/Mapping%20file.csv) cannot be downloaded by the browser. This may be a known issue with Juno or the Trust Team (cc @NathanosDev, it's still certification v1 here) when the URL contains encoded special characters. To fix the issue, try renaming the file without any blank or special characters, such as `Mappingfile.csv`. That should resolve the problem.

Thank you for looking into this. We will try it out. Our experience building with Juno has been great. Thanks for your assistance and for patiently answering our questions on Discord

It has been a great journey working with the DFINITY team. We are glad to see our vision come alive and excited to release features that the community has been asking for early next year. Yes, we plan on attending ETH SF and would love to connect!

I didn't know you were building a cool map! I'm always happy to help. Let me know if it works out with the file. If not, we'll find a solution.

nbelthan | 2023-12-18 07:03:42 UTC | #9

Thank you for the feedback @jennifertran! That's exactly our plan to keep our community engaged through the use of both fungible & non-fungible tokens as incentives. The existing community contribution networks are extractive of their users and do not offer any ownership or incentives for their communities for their contributions. Web and Mapz can change this paradigm. 
With ownership & gamification of the land parcels (land parcels being rewarded to loyal users) we can build a fair & just community network that will offer real-world utility as well and bring crypto & web3 to mainstream audiences. We do intend to build a governance structure & decentralize the app in the future and will definitely explore SNS for these initiatives.

This fails certification because the HTTP Gateway is searching the tree for the decoded path, but only the percent encoded version is there. The decoded version should be in the tree.

peterparker | 2023-12-18 16:08:06 UTC | #11

Are you 100% sure? Feels like you answered this last time we spoke about it as well but, after debugging we figured out that was another issue.

Anway we can discuss this separatly, not related to OP thread.

*Update:*

For the record, I had a discussion with Nathan about this certification issue. In summary, URLs should not be encoded - i.e. URL containing encodings are not supported currently, and I'll also be implementing an improvement in Juno (which will be shipped in Satellite v0.14.0).

Sorry for hijacking the thread about this.

 Interesting idea! That can be truly disruptive for EV-market.

Thank you @peterparker 

We fixed the spacing on the mapping file and it worked! Thank you for pointing that out! 
You can find the NFTs by clicking on our NFT land parcel navigator:
https://onzmk-taaaa-aaaal-acw4a-cai.icp0.io/

One can now type in any of these zip codes in the search field on the top left (94122, 94123, 94124, 94127, 94129, 94130, 94131, 94132, 94133, 94134). The map will zoom into the zip code. Click on the zoomed area, it will show you the zip code, owner & link to the NFT.

It works like a charm! :star_struck:

Hello @jennifertran I understand the idea of earning perks in the NFT land parcel. However i don't know how can we could implement such the earning perks with Internet Computer? The owners should provide his identity each time he/she use the resl EV station ? So we should colaborate with all the real EV stations ? how could the owners get EV charging discount ? Thank you in advance

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2023-12-27 18:01:08 UTC | #16

I see a couple of options here:

1. Enable ICP, ckBTC, ckETH, or any ICRC-1/2 payment on EV stations. We can track the IC principal when the EV car owner makes a payment at the EV station.

2. The EV station could enable sign-in to a rewards program using Internet Identity or a rewards card with a QR code linked to an II. A rewards program linked to an II is quite interesting.

Great work! May I have the link to Mapz repo if it is opensourced?
