Many NNS users want to merge their neurons into one neuron.  I would be very happy if this feature is introduced in the coming days.  For example, I have 8 neurons that I really want to merge.

Hi Emrah, this functionality became part of the NNS about two weeks ago, we are now working on the UI aspects for the NNS dapp. It is coming!

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-01-20 14:34:48 UTC | #3

Are you sure it works with seed neurons?  I keep getting ...

"No neuron ID specified in the management request."

when there's definitely one.  It seems to get past all the checks in merge_neurons() and then fails on manage_neuron_internal()

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-01-20 17:51:07 UTC | #4

Looking at the code, it looks like this happens if:

- The neuron id or subaccount does not exist;
- You are referring to the neuron by subaccount, but that subaccount does not reference a neuron.

This happens before the merge neuron function is ever called, and is part of the setup in `manage_neuron` before calling the specified neuron management command.

The next step would be to confirm the neuron that you're referencing. Can you please try another management command, like adding and then removing a hot key?

I would also be curious to know how you are sending this neuron management command. Is it with quill? If so, can you paste the quill command (without the specific neuron or account ids, of course)?

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-01-20 18:37:13 UTC | #5

I'm just using two neuron IDs (the ID and the source_neuron_id).  Let me have a quick go with quill because this is going to be such a timesaver if I can get it working!

EDIT: Hmmm, no luck and tired.  Will try in the morning, thanks!

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-02-06 22:24:09 UTC | #6

When will the merge neuron function appear in NNS?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-02-07 07:07:37 UTC | #7

It's coming soon, but I don't have a time-frame yet. We are working on a new frontend based on Svelte, so it slows things down if a feature also has to be implemented for the older Flutter frontend.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-02-10 18:21:01 UTC | #8

Hi John
I have created a neuron controlled by Ledger Nano device.  Everything worked very well until I tried to merge the maturity where is says the function is not implemented with those devices.  Was quiet a surprise.  Is the merge maturity been working for Nano Ledger device?
Do you expect to have the merge neuron to work with those devices?
thanks for the hint on this

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-02-13 18:25:59 UTC | #9

That feature has been implemented, but not yet release on the Ledger app site. So it's coming, but you can't merge maturity just yet with the Ledger device.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-03-14 08:59:00 UTC | #10

I stil dont see that merge button next to the split button, however on the roadmap it says the function is "Deployed". Which one it is, deploy or not deployed? Any comments?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-03-14 09:04:34 UTC | #11

It is deployed. Just not yet included into the front end.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-03-14 09:10:52 UTC | #12

So we cant use it yet in the NNS?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-03-14 09:24:14 UTC | #13

You can, but not using the front end, so not if you are not familiar with coding, you can't yet, but very soon.

It will probably be a while before the update appears with merging neurons. Can a developer possibly explain to us how to merge it manually? It would be best if it were simple or detailed with pictures etc. That would help everyone who would like to merge neurons before the update appears.

Thanks in advance.

We initialized the releasing process. However while testing we discovered an edge case issue which we would like to fix first. I cannot give you a precise eta on when it will be deployed in production - I don't work directly on this - but it is definitely our will to move forward aka sooner than "in a while". We are actively working on it. As soon as I get any news, I'll update the thread.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-29 19:29:57 UTC | #17

Given that the release is imminent, I think it would not be a good use of time to attempt to create effective user documentation for a manual process. It should be coming soon, thank you for your patience!

kmanxhuka | 2022-04-02 23:20:56 UTC | #18

I got a question for neuron merging: how does it affect the age bonus of the neurons? Does it have the same impact as increasing the stake (topping up) of the Neuron, in which the age of the Neuron changes?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-04 18:55:29 UTC | #19

When you merge two neurons, any age accumulated in the neurons is combined -- assuming they are both non-dissolving at the time you merge.

If the source neuron has no age, then the final age will be the exact same as just increasing the stake by that same maturity.

If the source neuron does have age, though, then final result will be: `(source_stake * source_age + target_stake * target_age) / (source_stake + target_stake)`.

-------------------------

jonit | 2022-04-07 11:45:42 UTC | #20

Thanks so much for introducing the merge function.

Sorry can you clarify, what happens to the age of combined neurones, I combined two neurones and the new neuron had the age of the one with the longest dissolve not the combined age. Actually that's what I would want and expect to happen, so not sure what you mean by combined?
I cant see many people wanting to add the two ages together to increase the total age when they merge.

Also I see we can't use this merge function on hot keyed neurons in the NNS app. Since seed and early contributor token holders would be the people who need this merge function the most is there are way we can combine our neurons?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-07 16:27:24 UTC | #21

Please see https://medium.com/dfinity/internet-computer-nns-neurons-can-now-be-merged-8b4e44584dc2, which clarifies what will happen with the combined age and dissolve delay.

-------------------------

jonit | 2022-04-07 16:44:37 UTC | #22

Thanks, is it possible to perform this action in the command line without quill?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-07 16:55:59 UTC | #23

The NNS Dapp rolled out this feature today for those with neurons created in the NNS Dapp. If your neuron was created with quill, you will need to merge with quill.

-------------------------

jonit | 2022-04-07 17:13:02 UTC | #24

these are seed neurons so not created with quill

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-07 17:24:20 UTC | #25

Ah, seed neurons. Those are controlled via a private key file you possess, right? This is also a case where quill is necessary, although you have the option migrating to a Ledger Nano instead — once the Nano supports the merge neurons operation.

-------------------------

jonit | 2022-04-07 17:34:20 UTC | #26

I've absolutely no idea how to use quill, the instructions are a little technical for me

-------------------------

Cris.MntYetti | 2022-04-07 18:08:29 UTC | #27

Quick question. Is it possible to merge a neuron created via NNS with a neuron created via Ledger? Eventually, which one has the control after the merge?

I think you are very right that it is nowhere as easy as it should be yet.

I have spent last few weeks working on simplifying developer experience for deploying smart contracts. I usually jump between user-facing experience and developer facing.

-------------------------

Mike1 | 2022-04-08 13:37:53 UTC | #31

I don't understand the specific meaning of "If the source neuron has no age, then the final age will be the exact same as just increasing the stake by that same maturity." Can you elaborate?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-08 16:04:55 UTC | #32

The calculation for merging age is:
```
(source_stake * source_age + target_stake * target_age) / (source_stake + target_stake)
```
If the source has no age, this simplifies to:
```
(target_stake * target_age) / (source_stake + target_stake)
```
This last calculation is identical to what is done for "topping up" or adding stake to an existing neuron, and has the effect of "distributing" the age of the neuron across all of the new stake.

Age is like seasoning on a stake. If you suddenly add more meat, you'll need to spread the seasoning around to cover the whole thing. The amount of "seasoning per square inch" would be determined using the same type of calculation.

-------------------------

@jwiegley 
I sent you PM with a neuron merging problem  
thanks

-------------------------

na123456 | 2022-04-10 23:59:04 UTC | #37

comparing to not merged neurons, merged neurons rewards decreased substantially. Merged neurons rewards calculate system has problem or bug, I think.

-------------------------

na123456 | 2022-04-11 00:05:01 UTC | #38

1. merged neuron rewards with 4year lockup and 7year lockup are same.
2. comparing to not merged neurons, merged neurons rewards decreased substantially.

So I thing merge neuron reward calculate system has problem now.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-11 01:38:17 UTC | #39

I think the problem you are seeing is a problem with reporting maturity as a percentage of stake. If you have a neuron with 50% maturity and 1 ICP stake, and you merge it into a neuron with 10 ICP, it will only increase the target neuron's maturity by 5%. No actual maturity is lost, it's just not reporting the same terms as before because the divisor is different. Does that make sense?

-------------------------

na123456 | 2022-04-11 02:25:35 UTC | #41

It is not the situation you are saying.

if 50% maturity and 1 ICP stake merge it into a neuron with 10 ICP, 11 ICP 's rewards after merged decrease substantially comparing to 1 ICP and 10 ICP separately.

after merged calculation system has problem of bug, I think.

-------------------------

na123456 | 2022-04-11 02:30:21 UTC | #42

while 1 ICP can get 0.07% rewards and 10 ICP can get reward 0.07% rewards per a day, merged 11 ICP can get 0.01% rewards per a day.

this is current situation.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-11 03:34:24 UTC | #43

If both neurons were received 0.07%, then the sum should also receive 0.07%. Did you merge into a new neuron that hasn't voted before? It may take a few days in that case for ballots to be created on behalf of that neuron.

-------------------------

na123456 | 2022-04-11 04:25:52 UTC | #44

It make sense.

on weekend, there are few chance to vote.
after merged, depending on vote opportunity, rewards could decrease.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2022-04-12 06:13:56 UTC | #45

If the daily reward is fixed and distributed proportionally based on voting power, for neurons with the same dissolved delay supposed have the same maturity yield. But why currently I saw different maturity yield from neuron without merged(original) vs 2 neurons merged vs 4 neurons merged ? (note: all the neurons voted and follow the same neuron followees)

The followings are the screenshot of today (12 April 2022) daily maturity.
All the following neurons have the identical state (same dissolve delay, governance voted and follow the same neuron followee)

This neuron with no merged (original) yield 0.078%
![no-merge-neurons|639x321](upload://SKP0LOHNvHsjXBdbSOOaJDBpVj.jpeg)

This neuron from merging two neurons yield 0.053%
![merge-2-neurons|639x321](upload://y5WVzaAJjBM7IOCbf8iM3Uk1t3l.jpeg)

This neuron from merging four neurons yield only 0.023%
![merge-4-neurons|639x321](upload://bjYu2ns5p2QeHmvGYFCVlcBkO7A.jpeg)

First I thought it was a glitch from the effect of merging neurons, but the maturity are consistent for the past 4 days, so I think it is a bug from merging.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-04-12 11:31:18 UTC | #46

People that are flagged for the community fund cannot merge staked neurons into 1.

I want ask why this is and what difference this makes in global by making the merge option for community fund members unable?

I also want to add that not everyone had the chance yet, to reverse their possition for the community fund. 

So

That makes it uncomfortable for those who want to merge staked neurons and exit the community fund. 

Also 

Is their maybe any alternatives for this in the sentence of merging staked neurons for community fund members that do want to participate? 

Thanks!

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-12 15:01:26 UTC | #47

Neurons earn rewards from the **ballots** that are created on their behalf whenever a proposal is created. So it will take at least the maximum proposal voting period number of days before you start seeing ballots created from the merged neuron getting rewarded. In the meantime, fractional rewards should be going to your now empty neurons, which you can recover by merging those neurons once again after this period of time. Please check the numbers again at least one week after merging, to ensure that all of the ballots are now fully representative of the new stake amounts.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-12 15:02:17 UTC | #48

We disabled merging for the community fund simply because there were still so many unknown around what the flag actually meant. It would be trivial to allow merging of two neurons who both participate in the community fund. I will propose this.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-12 17:08:50 UTC | #49

Do we now know what the community fund flag actually means?

 Your statement "there were still so many unknown around what the flag actually meant" seems to imply that we now know what that flag actually means.

 If i have one neuron with cf flag and one without, in the new proposal, would i need to turn the cf flag for both to merge? I would like to know what that cf flag actually means.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-12 18:45:55 UTC | #50

I didn't mean to imply that we now have full clarity. We still don't, but stay tuned as the SNS feature develops, since this is a precursor to rolling out any community fund features.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2022-04-14 01:19:32 UTC | #51

Hi @jwiegley here some updates : my neurons from merging has a normal maturity yield now. And also I've merged the unclaimed maturity from the source neuron. Thanks for your explanation about how the mechanic of merging neurons work. :ok_hand:

-------------------------

reboot | 2022-04-16 09:55:12 UTC | #52

Hi ajismyid, I encountered the same issue as yours, as I just merged two neurons 3 days ago. But as I checked the maturity of the source neuron which I merged to another neuron, it shows the maturity of this neuron is 0.  My question is even it shows 0, you can still merge the unclaimed maturity from the source neuron? Thanks

-------------------------

[/quote]

Yes. Give it sometimes (around 5-7 days) after merging, and re-merged your both neuron. The unclaimed maturity will show up on your destination neuron.

-------------------------

reboot | 2022-04-18 07:24:11 UTC | #54

Thanks ajismyid, I just merged the two neurons just now, however I didn't found the unclaimed maturity show up on the destination neuron, and the source neuron disappeared. It's a bit weird. I'm pretty sure the unclaimed maturity is not a very small number, so I couldn't miss it if it's merged.

Fkshalyeeo | 2022-04-24 19:47:19 UTC | #55

Hello! I am really confronted with the problem of merging two neurons that both belong to the community fund. I have such a need and I am very much looking forward to solve it. It is not completely clear to me now why it may present some difficulty. Could you please clarify this situation for me and tell me about further plans on this issue?

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-04-26 09:45:58 UTC | #57

Your basically screwed if you joined the community fund.

You wil not be able to merge any neurons. No further explanation.

Apologies in the name of Dfinity, someone needs to say it.

Greatings

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-26 10:13:49 UTC | #58

Wouldn't one be able to "unjoin" the community fund at some not-so-distant future? @lara, @jwiegley ?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-26 16:11:25 UTC | #59

I'm not sure that unjoining will ever be possible, as they represent "committed funds".

Merging of community fund neurons is disabled currently because we don't fully know how they will operate. For example (this is not planned, just an example): Imagine that a community fund neuron supports an SNS by providing its stake as liquidity to an AMM pool for the dissolve duration of the neuron. This would represent a stable source of funding for that pool, tied to the neuron. What would it mean, then, for the neuron to be merged into another? Would the pool lose that funding? Would the merged neuron be drawn into the pool? Etc.

There are still too many unknowns, until the feature is more fully worked out.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-26 16:27:46 UTC | #60

[quote="lara, post:30, topic:8390"]
As already promised, if you have accidentally activated the flag, there will be a time period where you can revert this choice. Note however that currently having set the flag does not have any effect on your neuron: you can vote and get rewards as with any other neuron
[/quote]

This is what @lara said 27d ago...hence i am surprised that now we are saying "no unjoin". 

Additionally @lara said that having that flag on a neuron "does not have any effect" on the neuron..clearly currently a community fund cannot be merged... I am not exactly sure why/how these communication gaps exists. I think having a named product manager(who speaks authoratively for the feature) for each major functionality would help tremendously.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-26 20:15:59 UTC | #61

Note that it may be that all current community fund allocations will be reset — which is what I believe @lara was referring to — but this will be a one-time event. She and I speak often, but the landscape changes week to week. We're both trying to give you the most up-to-date information that we have at any given point in time.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-27 02:42:39 UTC | #62

Thanks, john. I am not sure who shapes the "envelope" around community funds. As you are aware, this join-the-community-fund button was introduced in December 2021, the first tweet around this was in September 2021 by Dominic. 

This uncertainty causes issues for folks who have inadvertently clicked the join-the-community-fund button.

-------------------------

lara | 2022-05-02 11:08:48 UTC | #63

Hi all,
right, as @jwiegley pointed out I don't think we were contradicting each other.
We promised that everyone who joined the community fund now has the opportunity to disable this again before the feature is enabled.
*After the feature is really in effect* it might be that this is a one-way feature (you can join the fund but not un-join), this will have to be worked out with the final design that will surely be shared with the community.

Probably I was a bit too imprecise when I stated that the flag "does not have any effect". Sorry if this caused confusion. As you rightly pointed out it is not possible to merge these neurons. However, you can still vote with the neuron and get rewards as with any other neuron (you just have to manage it separately). 
I hope this adds some clarity. Please let us know if you have more questions!

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-05-02 12:26:41 UTC | #64

How about we start a vote on NNS this week to reset all community fund neurons?

This is very useful for those who cannot merge their neurons. 🙂

lara | 2022-05-02 16:01:58 UTC | #66

Maybe give me 1-2 days to think about the possibilities and what would be easiest?
If the main concern is that the neurons cannot be merged, another option might be to just remove this restriction from the merge_neuron functionality.. But I prefer to think a bit more about the consequences of each choice with the team.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-03 04:32:02 UTC | #67

And also remove the "join crowd funding " button; which is the source of this conundrum.

-------------------------

lara | 2022-05-05 13:46:20 UTC | #68

Hi all, so we thought about this a little more and think that an easily implementable fix for this would be to remove the restriction in merge_neuron that does not allow community fund neurons to be merged.
This would mean that a community fund neuron could be merged with any other neuron, in particular it could also be merged into a non-community fund neuron. 

Note that we are also working on a clearer design for the community fund and will of course share news with you one we have a more fleshed out design!

[/quote]

The track record of the promise of community fund detailed design has been not too promising.  The community has been asking about the details of the community fund for MONTHS in this forum on multiple topics.

The Join Community Fund button should never have been introduced if the user doesnt know , at all, what joining the community fund means.

Accordingly we SHOULD remove the Join Community Fund button till the design is clear; so that it doesnt trap unwitting users.

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-05-05 19:11:42 UTC | #70

This is a good idea and solves the problem of merging community fund neurons. Voting on this can start. Everyone should be able to decide for themselves.

-------------------------

lara | 2022-05-06 15:55:36 UTC | #71

Let me maybe try to provide a bit of explanation: One of the reasons we haven't been making quick progress on the community fund design is that the NNS team is very focused and working on shipping the SNS features. As you see on [our roadmap](https://dfinity.org/roadmap/?m=vanadium) the SNS is planned to be released before the community fund. This also makes sense as the community fund is building on the SNSs to some extent (e.g., the community fund can be invested in SNSs).
I know that this does not fully address your concern, but maybe it can shed some light on our thinking.

This being said, we do actually make progress on the design (I was just participating a meeting yesterday) so I really hope we can share some ideas in the next few weeks.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-06 17:46:41 UTC | #72

Thanks @lara for your explanation. Let me clarify my position. 

A. I believe that community funding will be a very good feature when implemented based on tweets from Dom, a medium article referencing Lomesh and several other tweets from others.

B. I do think that the team is working hard in churning out features that are higher priority than community funding and in certain cases the community funding is dependent on these features.

Now, the facts: 

(i) join-the-community fund button appeared in NOV 2021. 
(ii) Till now (MAY 2022) , we have none of the details about what the joining the community fund would entail. Would it even be legal in certain jurisdictions without passing the Hewey test? Would it expose the participants to undue loss?
(iii) Others have inadvertently joined the community fund by mistake. 

Clear questions:

Q1. My issue is that join-the-community-fund button was ill-concieved at the time(NOV 2021) of it's appearance on the UI and it still remains so. Would you agree to that?

Q2: If so, why should we not have a governance proposal that removes that button from the UI so that it does not ensnare future "clickers"?

Q3. What are the advantages(if any) of having a join-the-community-fund button if NO ONE can even tell us what joining-the-community-fund will do in very specific terms for the risk-reward envelope? 

Q4. Why not remove the join-the-community-fund button, cone back with the design and THEN enable this button again?

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-05-07 12:25:15 UTC | #73

The best fix is to let people reverse the community fund.
It's outrageous how people got tricked into this.
Why taking the restrictions away if people want to exit? 
In which sentence this looks okéy for you or the team? 
This is just another way to let them be stuck into this outrageous community fund.
You basically took every hope away for those who are stuck in this and payed a lots of money for those tokens.
Outrageous, i demand a revert option asap. 
No more bullshit, get it over with and let people exit that community fund that is clearly not up to date and shouldn't have been released in the first place.
Al the rest is exuzes to let people be scammed in this outrageous community fund.

You state that the team is "very focused and working on shipping the SNS", THAT THIS IS THE REASON THEIR IS NO TIME FOR THE COMMUNITY FUND. BUT FOR RELEASING THAT COMMUNITY BUTTON THEIR WAS TIME ENOUGH?! WHERE IS THE LOGIC?! 
AGAIN OUTRAGEOUS. 

Else this needs to go in debate for court in my opinion. Can't believe the way everything went can be approved by any judge.
Do the right thing or get sued for this. The END!

I share your frustratition and, unfortunately, more and more people are getting frustrated with the direction IC goes.  We all understand this is the best blockchain technology.  The problem is everywhere else.
I started investing in June 2021 after they announced Endorphin on Medium.  Remember Endorphin?  That was this incredible phone OS system.
Then, there was Badlands
Then, people's party
Then, community funds
Then, last summer, staking was a passive investment.  Now it is a governance token.
Then, the best of all, a TAX evasion system with price modulation where 100ˋs of millions of $ would evade Taxes with a simple price modulation system.
I am very confident this Tax Evasion system will be the first to come out before everything else on this list.  Good chances before the community fund button removal.
This is how I, and many other people are seeing Dfinity now.  This is sad but have no choice... 8 years locked.
Hope post like this one will make Dfinity thinking more about how they manage in general.  Stop announcing things that are not happening (or happening very soon) and stop to be a tax evasion developper. 

Still, the greatest blockchain of all time.  Really impressed with the tech and all the programmers working on it.

I refuse to accept the status quo; if it needs to be changed.

 I am giving the community including the conversational leads @lara and @jwiegley from dfinity for their alternate perspectives to see if they can convince the community; prior to creating a governance proposal.

While i am fairly certain that dfinity will be working on their own priorities for now, we can change minds by perservance.

I encourage the community to raise its voice whenever it feels the system could be improved, even if that improvement is by simplification or _removing_ features. This is the only way we can prove that governance has truly become decentralized: when people are no longer waiting for DFINITY to pursue new design decisions.

So, I encourage the community to find its own voice, as it has been doing here in these forums.

I initially hesitated replying because my thought is a subtle one and subject to misinterpretation, but **while I disagree with the low-level examples and reasons you provide, I think we end up at similar high-level places.** we reach similar conclusions.

## Allow me to explain why I disagree with your examples:

1. **Badlands, Endorphin were all ideas and proposals, not feature announcements -**  These are proposals and were NEVER announced as features, but floated as ideas. Badlands even has the disclaimer, " *Everyone, please note: this is a technical pre-post for those interested in the Badlands concept, rather than a formal post announcing details of the project. There are several competing demands on the teams developing the Internet Computer ecosystem at the moment,*" They notably were written on Dom's personal medium post as proposals (which is an exception).

2. **People Party is in active development** - The team working on it has been working on it for a long time (at least since Fall 2021) to make everything work and even answer questions on dev forum. It has been a slog working through the edge cases and kinks.

3. **These features you mentioned are minority** - there have been *dozens of other features* and improvements across the IC since Genesis. It seems to me that many times once a feature is shipped it recedes to a forgotten land (this is not new to IC, common in tech where all that matters is the "next thing.")

4. **ICP + NNS was always designed to be a governance token.** Fwiw, I have always written and thought about it this way. Not sure why you think it was "passive investment." If anything by DFINITY said that i would be honestly surprised (and a mistake imo).

## Where I do think you and I agree

1. It's clear to me that even though Badlands and Endorphin were posted as just ideas (the kind that Vitalik and others have done in crypto space), that they were seen by many in the community as promises. To be blunt: If 99% of people read the tweet, but did not read the articles or dev forum articles, I can understand why they may think they were actually in the roadmap. It is clear DFINITY should learn and iterate from that.

2. It's clear to me that even though we post estimates and constant updates on features, there is a disconnect where readers cannot tell what is in the camp of "*straightforward, mechanical engineering" that just takes X hours*"... and what is in the camp of "*highly innovative R&D which has dead ends, project restarts, edge cases, etc...*" People Parties is such an example, and I do not think the costly side of innovation is properly communicated.

Well on the other hand, I think it is perfectly reasonable to have a roadmap where we lay out the direction of the IC: https://dfinity.org/roadmap/

The roadmap is what we update and see as the things we are working on. You will see both badlands and Endorphin are just "for consideration."

If you think, "yes, diego but community does not consider the roadmap when complaining about X", I think that is fair and it shows that the roadmap is not sufficiently the artifact discussed.

So I disagree with you that there should be no roadmap (imagine a world where only features about to be released were discussed or released? No developer or design discussions, etc...)

### I do agree with you that the communication went awry in a few places:

**My ultimate writing principle if that the reader does not understand something, it is the writer's responsibility.** So I think you are right in being frustrated @coteclaude (regardless of what DFINITY's *intent* is). 

* People think some ideas floated to the community were active projects (they never were, and I even actively wrote that). 
* People are not aware about the hard part of estimating Research & Development. Some features are mechanical work, while others involve doing things no one has done before so estimates are very hard to pin down and sometimes we only know once we start. I do not think people are aware, nor do we make it easy for people to be aware.
* I think features like [Canister security sandboxing](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/security-sandboxing/7438/32?u=diegop) are extremely difficult and important, but they rarely seem to be brought up when discussing things DFINITY has accomplished. I think its clear (and very natural) that user-facing features are remembered more than security or developer-facing features, so I think more care should be made to make their user-facing impact clearer.
* I think the announcement of community fund was premature, everyone I know thinks the same and that is why the intent is to give users the ability to undo actions from that button.

I 100% agree with this. Folks' opinions hold significant sway.

Any news for community fund on nns??

Thanks for taking the time to clarify your points and for the honest feedback! 

Note that I was not closely involved in the decisions of releasing the community fund button, but let me try to answer your questions as well as I can. In addition, I am happy to bring your feedback back to the rest of the team to consider it when planning the next steps.

Q1. I agree that the design is not finalised in detail.

Q2. I just wanted to add another alternative for solving the problem that community neurons cannot be merged. 
**Of course community members can and should make proposals with their own ideas. I think this is core to decentralisation and do not want to discourage that!**
If you see requests like "please discuss on the forum before submitting a proposal", I think this is rather for people to be able to engage prior to the vote and, for some topics where some DFINITY members are experts, I think it makes sense that we also leave enough time for them to contribute to make design proposals as good as they can be / point out possible alternatives. But no matter the discussion, anyone can and should submit proposals that they find important.

Q3. One motivation for having the community fund button might be that those who like to show the support of this high level idea can already do so.

Q4. As mentioned in 3, one advantage might be that those who want to “show their support for the community fund” can still do so.
In any case, we also have to provide a solution for people who joined accidentally. We could also “plan” the best solution for how neurons can opt-out of the community fund and for what the button should show now / during the opt-out period / after the feature exists together, e.g., when we discuss the design of the feature (that we are working on).

I hope this provides some additional inputs!

I still support the creation of an icp return opportunity from the public fund, as I wrote about earlier in this thread. And I received confirming assurances, and now the silence, although I was promised to fix the situation and that it will happen as soon as possible.And I also do not intend to stop. Pay attention to us. There are many of us.

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-06-10 05:27:13 UTC | #82

I also think it's taking a long time to fix this problem.  A lot of people are affected.  Maybe the developers should prioritize it?

I want to be helpful and I saw your comment. Can you clarify which is the problem you think should be fixed? (I have successfully merged neurons for example), so there is some edge case or corner case you refer to (but I’m unaware of) which I can escalate to the team

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-06-10 20:47:40 UTC | #84

I would like to return one of my neurons that I accidentally assigned to the Community Fund as a normal neuron. After that, I could merge it with the other normal neuron.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-06-16 16:22:49 UTC | #85

I want to confirm that being able to remove a neuron from CF is an upcoming feature for the CF.

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:13701"]
As previously agreed & communicated, before the implementation and go-live of the proposed CF process, users will have the ability to opt out their CF neurons during a period of at least 3 months. The community will be informed once un-toggling is available.
