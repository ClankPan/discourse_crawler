My understanding is that the goal of the internet computer is to become a world computer, to build a future where anything can be built on the blockchain. Obviously this would take a long time before this dream can be realized if it is possible at all.

 Is it possible to do live stream using the internet computer? If not will it be possible in the future to do something like this? Are there any projects that you guys are aware of working on live streaming? How would this work at of fundamental level?
