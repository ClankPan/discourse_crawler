Hi,

The package `rand` has no support for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, unless the `js` feature is enabled, i.e. add `getrandom = { version = "0.2", features = ["js"] }` to the dependencies.

```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
getrandom = { version = "0.2", features = ["js"] }
```

When running:

```
dfx deploy canister_name
```

The following error is thrown:

```
The invocation to the wallet call forward method failed with the error: An error happened during the call: 5: Wasm module of canister xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx is not valid: Wasm module has an invalid import section. Module imports function '__wbindgen_object_drop_ref' from '__wbindgen_placeholder__' that is not exported by the runtime.
```

The error is only thrown on `dfx cli`, where simply running the Rust cargo build does not throw an error.

```
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --package xxxx
```

The `rand` package can be quite useful when mocking data.

Versions:
cargo 1.54.0
rustc 1.54.0
rustup 1.24.3
