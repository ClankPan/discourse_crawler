Hello everyone,

We have worked with London App Brewery, the creators of the bestselling Udemy course “[The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=F725EDBEC3618EB3FEF9)” to incorporate dapp development on the IC in their course.

The course takes students through Web2 development, from HTML to more advanced programming, and now also Web3 development from walking through basic concepts to developing a NFT marketplace.

The course is here: [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=F725EDBEC3618EB3FEF9)

We would like to get some feedback on the IC-related sections, if you have had a chance to go through the course. Is it easy to follow? Is the content relevant? Any other feedback you can share?

Any thoughts about having courses on Udemy?

Thanks,
Carsten/DFINITY
