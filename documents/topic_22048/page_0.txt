All of my employees telephonic conversations are recorded. Can I upload my recordings and build the ultimate customer service AI voice bot?

-------------------------

cakemaker1 | 2023-08-10 13:14:24 UTC | #3

Few questions - 

How easily can ELNA be integrated into existing decentralized exchange platforms?
Is there documentation or an API available for integration purposes?
How can I train ELNA specifically to understand and handle cryptocurrency and DEX-related queries?

-------------------------

donge | 2023-08-10 14:19:23 UTC | #4

Looks awesome, Do you have a twitter?

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2023-08-10 14:24:54 UTC | #5

Thank you for the interesting suggestion! Using real customer service call recordings to train a voice AI assistant is a great potential use case. We are excited that elna's capabilities could be useful for building customized bots like this.

You're absolutely right that being able to upload audio transcripts and leverage real conversational data would enable creating an incredibly powerful and natural customer service agent.

While our initial release focuses on text-based conversation models, expanding to voice is on our roadmap. We want to take the time to robustly develop the infrastructure for secure voice data ingestion and training.

We will add this to our feature requests and keep you posted on progress towards audio support. Please feel free to join our Discord where we discuss product development.

Thanks again for sharing this inspiring idea! Our goal is for elna to be flexible enough to fulfill many niche use cases like this customized voice assistant. We value your input on how our platform could empower new applications of AI. > Adding this as a priority feature to our product feature backlog

Hi @cakemaker1 , thanks for the great questions!

Regarding integrations, our goal is to make elna as seamless to incorporate into existing dapps and platforms as possible. We plan to provide thorough documentation and APIs to cover common integration use cases. [Now in beta ] 

[Join our wait-list](https://forms.gle/SRP4PoM5AnSERZet7) 

For decentralized exchanges specifically, we envision elna agents being useful as smart assistant bots to help users with queries related to trading, liquidity pools, and anything DeFi.

To train elna on crypto/DEX topics, you could upload relevant content like wiki entries, blog posts, whitepapers, support docs, and community conversations. The more niche data you can provide, the better elna will be at fieldering domain-specific questions.

You can also fine-tune her responses to use appropriate terminology and align with a DeFi product's voice. We provide settings to customize tone, level of detail, etc.

Additionally, we will be integrating the training data as vector embeddings directly in the canister storage on Internet Computer. This provides more decentralization by keeping sensitive user data on chain rather than external servers.

I'd be happy to discuss further how we can tailor elna's capabilities for DEX platforms. Please feel free to reach out directly on Twitter/X

What parameters can be configured? Which applications are configurable? Can I configure chatbots, Q&A, support bots, summarization, and text generation, among others?

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2023-08-11 17:21:30 UTC | #12

Great question! Here are some details on the parameters and applications that can be configured with elna:

For any AI agent you build, elna allows customizing:

* Personality - Adjust tone, style, formality, voice
* Knowledge Source - Upload niche data to focus the training
* Response Details - Configure length, depth, and scope
* Interactivity - Set follow-up preferences and conversation flow
* Privacy - Manage data retention and visibility

These parameters can be applied to a wide range of agent types:

* Chatbots - For natural conversations and open dialog
* Q&A Bots - To handle common questions and searches
* Support Bots - For customer service and interactions
* Summarization - To process and condense long form content
* Text Generation - For creating original text like stories

We also leverage techniques like parameter efficient Instruction fine tuning to optimize models for specific tasks, beyond tweaking conversational settings. This adapts models to new domains efficiently.

Additionally, we can use zero shot and few shot prompting to tailor models for certain applications without extensive retraining. By providing just a few examples, we can specialize models for purposes like Q&A, search, content generation and more through prompting.

Between conversational parameters, efficient fine tuning, and prompting methods, elna provides multiple avenues to customize models for chatbots, personal assistants, content creation, customer service, and many other needs.

bob11 | 2023-08-15 16:57:54 UTC | #17

This is crazy and awesome.

How does the architecture work? Which model is running in a canister? I'm assuming there are still significant limitations in what you can do with LLMs on ICP.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-08-16 12:24:37 UTC | #18

Second that!

I'd love to learn more about the architecture.

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2023-08-16 23:36:27 UTC | #19

We are on closed alpha testing, Hopefully will be opening our beta release in coming month

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2023-08-17 01:08:52 UTC | #20

Thanks for the interest @domwoe!

In short 

Our initial POC stores vector embeddings for user data in canisters while leveraging existing fine-tuned models externally. This allows creating specialized bots with custom knowledge.

Later we plan on running the inference engine fully on-chain using WebAssembly in canisters. Canister size is a limitation, but we think breakthroughs are achievable through techniques like quantization.

Now Training model on canister 
We feel full fine-tuning may be overkill - but methods like LoRA for parameter efficient fine-tuning could adapt models efficiently.

Currently there is no plan to Pre training a model from scratch as its unnecessary and almost impossible in canister

Feel free to ask us any details on the same

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2023-08-17 01:13:58 UTC | #21

Thanks a lot @bob11 for your awesome support 

Our current architecture plans using smaller conversational model in the canister to handle simple interactions using custom data stored on-chain [vector embeddings].

For more complex inferences, we integrate with larger external models running off-chain. The canister mainly coordinates querying the API for these models.

You're correct that there are still significant limitations around running very large language models fully on-chain due to canister memory constraints. We have plans for methods like knowledge distillation and model quantization to help address this.

Our roadmap includes continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible for on-chain inference as canister computing power expands. But our hybrid approach enables customization and personalization today across many use cases by keeping niche training data on-chain while leveraging larger off-chain models where needed.

Hey @icpp , thank you for reaching out and sharing your awesome project! It's great to see the pioneering work you've done running open source conversational AI models in canisters using C/C++.

We really appreciate you open sourcing llama2.c - that will be an invaluable resource. Your technical demonstration is an inspiration as we work to bring key components on-chain.

Our current prototype uses Python for workflow orchestration and Motoko for canister logic. But we are very interested to evaluate C/C++ for core inference operations as you have done. The ability to optimize and compile models natively could be a big help. [We are struggling with web assembly limitations  ]

We would love to take you up on the offer to provide guidance if we explore going down the C/C++ path in our canisters. Don't hesitate to reach out if you ever want to brainstorm ideas as we push towards fully on-chain conversational AI together! Thanks again for your pioneering contributions.

Let me know if you need any other details on our roadmap or technical approach. Excited to collaborate with community members like yourself to make decentralized AI a reality!

> Would like to have a call with you discuss and brainstorm further
