Hi Everyone!

I am writing from Vienna, Austria (Europe). I am fascinated by the potential of an Internet Computer and by the ambitions of Dfinity!

I am an entrepreneur by heart, a venture capitalist, an iOS developer and graduate of the Apple Developer Academy 2019/2020 in Naples, Italy.

Looking forward to connect with people in the region!

Best, Klaus.

Hi, I'm sorry but I'm new to the Internet Computer and I'm new to these forums. I don't know if I'm missing something but how did you create a new forum post? I don't know if it's something simple I'm missing but I cannot find where I'm supposed to create a new topic? How did you write this "Hello" post? Thank you!
