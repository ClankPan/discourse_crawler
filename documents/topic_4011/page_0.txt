Hi all, is there a publicly available rosetta node available for someone who doesn't have the resources to setup a node themselves? 

I'm aiming to use it to broadcast locally signed transactions in order to perform transfers. Refer - https://github.com/dfinity/rosetta-client#performing-transfers-while-keeping-the-private-keys-in-an-isolated-environment
