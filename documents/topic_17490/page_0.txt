Sometimes an off-chain asynchronous request need contain a set of http requests. Is there a way to do it in one update call?

Each awaiting of an async call resets your cycle limit, so you would just call them in order and the function would eventually succeed provided you don't overrun the cycle limit elsewhere.  You'll need to manage your async state and make sure data doesn't move out from under you as you will process over multiple rounds.
