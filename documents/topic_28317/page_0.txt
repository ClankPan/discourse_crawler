I would like to create a new canister into the new EU subnet. To manage that canister, i would like to use my NNS account with the my canister tab.

I know that the a new canister is only possible in the EU subnet if the corresponding cycles canister is also installed into the EU subnet. 

My question is, Is there a way to create a new canister - running in EU subnet - but managed under NNS „my canister“ tab ??

Hey, you can achieve this by doing the following:
1. [Deploy to the EU subnet](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/concepts/subnet-types/#using-a-european-subnet) using `dfx`
2. Add your NNS dapp principal as a controller:
`dfx canister update-settings <canister id> --network ic --add-controller <principal>`
3. Link the this canister in the NNS dapp under the "My Canisters" tab using the canister id.

I hope this helps.

@chepreghy very cool.

I can verify its functionality. 

I've successfully created a new canister for a homepage project on the EU Subnet and added it to my NNS user.
