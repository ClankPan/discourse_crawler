Hello everyone,

You might have seen that we proposed to update one of the newly deployed API boundary nodes with [proposal 130452](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130452). However, as you can see in the payload, the node to be updated is duplicated. This is due to a bug in a part of our tooling to make proposals. Therefore, we recommend to reject this proposal.
