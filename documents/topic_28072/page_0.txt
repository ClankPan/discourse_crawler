Is there a way to bind an Asset canister to a dedicated Motoko canister ?

If I have a dfx.json file with two canister, an Asset canister for a frontend application and a backend Motoko canister, which is hosting the data. 

How can I make sure, that only the frontend canister can query the public functions from the Motoko canister ?

Hey @rbole,

the asset canister doesn't call/query your backend canister. The asset canister only holds static assets that your browser will download. It's the application in your browser that will call/query your backend canister with the Identity you attach to the agent.

Hey @domwoe thank you, That's my observation too, I just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly, thanks.
