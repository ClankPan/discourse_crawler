Hello everyone,

As I have read in IC documentation, canister can process only one update request at a time, and the completion time for an update is about 1-5 seconds to pass through consensus.
Assume that I have a list of users, each user has a score, the list is being stored on canister's memory.
Then the canister can only update score of 12-60 users per minutes?

I know that this is a very basic question, but please tell me if I misunderstood something.

Thank you!
