Hi all,

I recently made a post on Indie hackers regarding Dfinity - I think that whole community could really benefit from using Dfinity and may be open to this technology and wanted to share my first hand experience with it. I was wondering if any Dfinity community members would like to post any constructive feedback on that thread, sharing both pros and cons in an objective way as possible? 

I'm hoping this could spur healthy conversations about using Dfinity for new projects.
