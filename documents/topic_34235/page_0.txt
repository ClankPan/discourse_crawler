I'm encountering a trailing slash issue in our ICP project on pro.blockza.io and jp.blockza.io. It works correctly on localhost with 'trailingSlash: true,' but it doesn't work when deployed online. Could you help us resolve this?

With trailing slash: https://pro.blockza.io/article/1718856640355684236/
Without trailing slash: https://pro.blockza.io/article/1718856640355684236

Common Issues Related to Trailing Slash:
Duplicate Content:
If both versions of a URL (with and without the trailing slash) return the same content, search engines may treat them as different pages, leading to duplicate content issues. This can negatively impact SEO.

Routing Problems:
In some web frameworks or content management systems (CMS), the presence or absence of a trailing slash can lead to different pages or errors. For example, https://pro.blockza.io/article/1718856640355684236 might load a page, while https://pro.blockza.io/article/1718856640355684236/ might lead to a 404 error if not handled correctly.

Canonical URLs:
Search engines prefer a single, canonical URL for each piece of content. If you don't handle the trailing slash correctly, search engines might index both versions of the URL, splitting link equity and confusing users.

Can you clarify with what you're observing and what you're expecting? I'm not familiar with the setting you mention
