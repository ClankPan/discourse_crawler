I need access to the data that tells how much free storage space a canister has. How does one go about doing so? 

Any references to examples would be appreciated. Thanks in advance

Looking at the Interface Spec, it seems that the used memory is available through the IC management canister API with the `canister_status` method (https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#interface-overview). You need to be a controller to call the method though.
