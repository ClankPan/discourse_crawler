Hi,

**JavaScript, made by Brendan Eich in 1995, is one of the most generally utilized web advancement dialects. It was intended to assemble dynamic website pages from the get go. A content is a JS program that might be added to the HTML of any page. At the point when the page stacks, these contents execute naturally.**
