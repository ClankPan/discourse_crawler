Below is the summary and payload information that will be submitted to the NNS for a Register Known Neuron proposal to update the CodeGov known neuron.

# Proposal Title
CodeGov - Register Known Neuron (Update Oct 2024)

# Known Neuron ID
2649066124191664356

# Known Neuron Name
CodeGov

# Known Neuron Description
At CodeGov, our mission is to advance the decentralization of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) at the protocol level. We play an active role in reviewing proposals related to topics such as IC-OS Version Election, System Canister Management, Protocol Canister Management, Subnet Management, Participant Management, and Node Admin. These proposals are vital as they often entail significant changes to the ICPâ€™s codebase as well as the organization of the subnets and node topology to meet the decentralization strategy.  These technical proposals are typically presented weekly. Our responsibility is to stay informed about these developments, provide constructive feedback to DFINITY, and exercise independent judgment in voting on these proposals.

We view our efforts as crucial to the broader decentralization of ICP and are committed to continuing this work. You can learn more about our mission, our team, and how our known neuron is configured by visiting our website at [CodeGov.org](https://www.codegov.org/). Are you following?

# Proposal Summary
This proposal is a request that the NNS governing body approve a Register Known Neuron proposal to revise the known_neuron_data for name and description of the existing CodeGov.org neuron, which is neuron ID [2649066124191664356](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100).  
  
CodeGov actively reviews technical NNS proposal topics such as IC-OS Version Election, System Canister Management, Protocol Canister Management, Subnet Management, Participant Management, and Node Admin.  These reviews are real work that require skilled developers and contributors who have familiarity with the change pipeline for the internet computer protocol and infrastructure.  CodeGov has been successful at seeking grants to fund a team of skilled reviewers to perform this work and we intend to continue doing so as long as funding is available.  At times when we do not have resources to fund our own team of reviewers for specific technical topics, then an attempt will be made to find other people or organizations that are performing the reviews and the CodeGov known neuron will be set to follow them.  In the event that no other neuron exists to follow on a specific topic, then the CodeGov neuron will be set to follow DFINITY.  Hence, in addition to active participation in technical reviews and independent voting on NNS topics by our own team, we are also dedicated to supporting others in the ICP ecosystem and actively managing the neuron to ensure we always vote in an educated and informed way on all proposals submitted to the NNS.  We constantly strive to learn and communicate effectively with DFINITY and the ICP community regarding our work.  We hope to set a positive and credible example for how other people and organizations in the IC ecosystem can get involved in the decentralization of the internet computer at the protocol level.  
  
If you want to learn more about CodeGov and our current team and Followee selections for each proposal topic, then you can always find the information on the website at [CodeGov.org](https://www.codegov.org/).  We also have a [CodeGov community on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/3301574440448421105698593132787817936) where you can get a sense of the quality of our work by reading the reports that have been posted by all of our reviewers for every proposal.  
  
This proposal is submitted by Wenzel Bartlett, founder for The CodeGov Project.  The CodeGov known neuron was originally established on June 16, 2023 and was originally named CodeGov.org as per [proposal 122939](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122939).  We have been serving the ICP ecosystem with technical proposal reviews for over a year.
