[rustc_target::spec::wasm32_wasi - Rust (rust-lang.org)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_target/spec/wasm32_wasi/index.html)ã€‚

The `wasi` target is a proposal to define a standardized set of syscalls that WebAssembly files can interoperate with. This set of syscalls is intended to empower WebAssembly binaries with native capabilities such as filesystem access, network access, etc.

With wasm-wasi supporting, tools that relay on traditional model of computer can work on icp. (filesystem,...)
