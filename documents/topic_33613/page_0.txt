Happy Friday ICPeople! [Proposal 131389 ](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131389)to upgrade the NNS dapp just went live, please consider voting. :ballot_box:

Wasm sha256 hash: `e71d315a5969fce5766f1e19175078db2fd6c922b74cdd47f59a40088a96449c` (`https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/actions/runs/10089576273`)

## Change Log

### Added

* Add 2 new topics `ProtocolCanisterMangement` and `ServiceNervousSystemManagement` while not allowing following to be set.
* Make the WASM accessible via beta subdomains so we can deploy early versions there.

### Removed

* Removed `unsafe-eval` from Content Security Policy.

### Fixed

* HTML injection in error toast.
* Show unknown topic as "Unknown Topic (...")".
## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the [nns-dapp repo](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp):

```
git fetch  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout "0b2bfc18b5e2334b5b3dbfcf3c38912d129f6251"
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main && echo "OK" || echo "Commit is not on main branch!"
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm.gz
```

You may also want to verify the canister arguments. In the proposal they are binary, which is not very readable. Docker provides both binary and text formats and you can verify that the text format corresponds to the binary `arg_hex` field in the proposal.

```
cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did
didc encode "$(cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did)"
```
