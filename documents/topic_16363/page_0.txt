To my understanding clocks have to be in sync. 

Does day saving time in one region affect functionality or it doesnâ€™t ?

Your computer should solve this for you if you set your correct location/time in the settings.  On mac I think it is as easy as letting the system handle it(I think there is a check box and then your computer syncs with the network for proper time).
