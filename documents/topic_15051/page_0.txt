it seems like i can't call a canister by it's principal using `dfx canister --network ic call <canister_principal>`. I'm pretty sure this was possible in earlier versions, why was this feature removed?

OT: The help text says 
```
ARGS:
    <CANISTER_NAME>    Specifies the name of the canister to build. You must specify either a
                       canister name or the --all option
```
which is the wrong description for the argument.

EDIT: I had a dumb copy pasta error, in combination with the wrong ARGS description from above this lead me thinking it wasn't possible, but it is!

Works for me (dfv v0.11.2) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

e.g. getting the list of blog posts shared by the community on Papyrs:

```
dfx canister --network ic call "undmj-fiaaa-aaaan-qaocq-cai" list --query "(record {})"
```
