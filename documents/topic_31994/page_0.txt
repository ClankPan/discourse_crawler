I don't want to complain about this ICP downtime, but I would like to see more care taken in code review, especially for special subnets.

I propose:  separate subnet for ICP ledger
ICP ledger is the most important infrastructure for ICPs and will destroy the ICP ecosystem if stopped

Can the ICP ledger be in multiple subnets? Or have a back up that if a subnet goes wrong immediately itâ€™s activated on another subnet?

1. You don't really need multiple subnets for the ledger. Multiple clients running on the same nodes would accomplish the same thing. 

2.Or perhaps move the ICP ledger to a completely open and permissionless sharded architecture with the rewards controlled by the NNS.

3.Or we can simply refrain from overreacting, conduct a proper post-mortem analysis, and learn from this experience to enhance the network's resilience.

I like option 3.
