The NNS Team will be submitting the following proposals to publish new versions of SNS canisters to SNS-WASM this Friday, 2024-02-09.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## Additional Notes / Breaking Changes

Recall from [the recent issue](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/openchat-proposal-to-temporarily-unregister-the-userindex-canister-from-the-sns/27087) that the SNS root used to set the memory limit of all canisters it upgraded to 1GiB.
This behavior has been changed in [127516](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127516) and from now on a normal upgrade will not change a canisterâ€™s memory allocation.
However, all canisters that already have a low memory allocation from past upgrades, still keep this limit.
This could be especially risky for SNS canisters - as it would be even harder to recover if an SNS canister runs out of memory, especially governance.
Therefore, this upgrade includes a change that will, in a one-off, set the memory allocation of all SNS canisters to best effort.
Note that this does not include the SNS-controlled dapp canisters. SNS communities should be aware that the SNS-controlled dapp canister might have the 1GiB limit that was assigned on every SNS upgrade. However, since proposal [127674](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127674), SNS DAOs can adjust these limits by proposal.

My apologies. I accidentally posted the proposal text for NNS governance when I meant to post the proposal text for SNS governance. The actual proposal was correct:

This could lead to dapp canisters running out of memory when they reach the 1GB reserved memory allocation. Please check your memory allocation, using the `get_sns_canisters_summary` ([BoomDAO example](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/xjngq-yaaaa-aaaaq-aabha-cai#get_sns_canisters_summary)) method, and change the memory allocation using a `UpdateDappCanisterSettings` proposal if necessary.
