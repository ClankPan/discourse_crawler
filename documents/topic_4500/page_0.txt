I have uploaded a spec for a [basic fungible token standard](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/ic-fungible-token) along with my rationale. I know a few standards have been approved, but this one does differ to a lot of the existing proposed standards in a number of ways (e.g. we use the [AccountIdentifier](https://github.com/stephenandrews/motoko-accountid) as our token "addresses" as opposed to just the Principal).

A lot of what we are working on relies on a token standard (DEX, wrapped tokens, atomic bridges, token wallets etc), and we are hesitant to push too hard with development when there's no real consensus on what a token standard could look like. I am a supporter of a broader multi-token standard like erc1155 (e.g. [I have contributed to this one](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-for-a-standard-token-interface/1304)) however I think this needs to be fleshed out a bit more.

Does anyone else have any thoughts on what a basic (erc20-like) token standard should look like and/or contain?
