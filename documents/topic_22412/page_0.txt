As we delve into the core of ELNA's technical architecture, we aim to address some common queries that have emerged:

**Building the Foundation**

ELNA's inception was rooted in a vision of democratizing AI, enabling users to craft personalized chatbots tailored to their distinct requirements. To manifest this vision, we knew that a robust technical foundation was essential - one that facilitated seamless customization, secure deployment, and efficient data management. It's the decentralized attributes of the Internet Computer that offered the ideal foundation upon which to construct this revolutionary platform. However, we have encountered some hurdles on our path:

* Developing AI within Canister Web Assembly Environment: One of the challenges weâ€™ve tackled is developing AI technologies optimized for the canisterâ€™s web assembly environment.
* Instruction and Memory Limitations: The instruction and memory limitations of canisters pose constraints, particularly when dealing with the inference of larger models.
* Balancing Speed, Scale, Privacy, and Transparency: We are working on maintaining a delicate balance between speed, scale, privacy, and transparency while implementing AI functionality on a decentralized infrastructure.

I'm the creator of UncensoredGreats.com (chatbots based on collections of Ebooks), for which I'm currently looking to migrating from my web2 stack with ICP. To get this working 100% on-chain, I need to ditch my vectordb and model hosting providers.

Is your intended model as an independent D-app, or Vector DB and AI as a service (i.e., will you encourage 'user canisters' from 3rd party dapps)? For me this could either either mean the niche is filled, or a big problem solved.

@branbuilder Exciting to see the IC get the first AI project with LLMs on a blockchain, actually I do not think any other blockchain can do this.

I've been using desktop LLMs, and they are becoming quite good, especially the ones based on the latest Llama code from Facebook.

Since Georgi Gerganov from Bulgaria took Facebook's code and forked it by using C++ instead of Python we have been able to run pretty good LLMs on our desktop without a Nvidia card.

So it was a question of time until this would reach the IC, I am glad it has.

For those interested, you can start here and run your own LLM in your Mac:
[Georgi Gerganov C++ port of Llama is here.](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

And here is the main app that uses it for your desktop:
https://gpt4all.io/index.html

Search and you will see many decentralized implementations that run now in your desktop with good results.

Best of luck folks at ELNA, it's great to see this next step.

I can speak for myself on this one. 

My project focuses on books as training data, with the actual e-reader part next to the chatbot part. This way folks can see hallucination/AI bias on opinionated issues, in real time. 

The issue I ran into though is that this that my desired level of transparency opens me up to copyright issues. Even translations of the works of Socrates on my site are owned by big publishers >100 years later. And good luck getting permissions for such things. 

OpenAI and friends seem to bypass copyright law by centralizing/closing everything, which makes me very sad. So I'd like to bypass copyright law by opening/decentralizing everything. The way to do this ethically, I hope, is with a DAO model where the rightful author can always claim rewards/ownership of their work.

This opens up doors for training data that is the otherwise contentious/philosophical stuff chatgpt never gives straight answers to. Hence the name "UncensoredGreats", but uncensored really needs to be dao-censored for obvious reasons.

So for me decentralization is required to do cool chatbots. If your question about the backend was for me before, you're right, no long-term memory because of the extreme emphasis on true-to-the-source origin tracking. It's also all open-source, and I have an unpublished lightpaper if you were curious about the details.

josephgranata | 2023-08-30 05:17:55 UTC | #10

@evanmcfarland unless you have vast amounts of resources, including money I would advise to go the route of Satoshi Nakamoto if you plan to target people who can sue you for years.

Become anonymous, and make an anonymous DAO.

Otherwise refrain from being an easy target of lawsuits.

Best of luck, you do have a noble vision translating the great works is a good thing.

P.S. If you can DM me your lightpaper, AI is a topic I follow, and this is a great way to use it.

josephgranata | 2023-08-30 03:03:09 UTC | #11

Good to know.

Please let us know on this Forum if Llama CPP can run on a canister, I am very curious since I see some possible usage for future projects myself.

Best wishes with the project!

Definitely interested in the lightpaper.

Is there a demo/beta version where you can test a chatbot with a book?

Its working in canister. 

Currently we have some limitations with memory and instructions to run a larger model, hopefully @icpp and our team ELNA should be able to solve it for the IC community

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2023-08-30 08:24:34 UTC | #17

Can you tell us a little bit about the background of the team, the number of people and the main developers?

-------------------------

evanmcfarland | 2023-08-30 11:16:45 UTC | #18

Yes, it's live on the site (Web2 version). And sent ya the litepaper :)

Berg | 2023-08-30 14:34:56 UTC | #19

Thank you for the reply, Evan!

Ever since ChatGPT came out, the use case of conversing with books or documents was what I was waiting for the most - yet nobody (to my knowledge) was tackling it the right way. Until now!

In my opinion, if eventually the UG DAO can fulfill your vision, UncensoredGreats can become one of the most important projects on the IC!

P.S. I'd like to point out that the vision and scale of what UG can be is greater than most if not all SNS funded projects to date!

P.S.2 I sense that the team behind UG are either crypto veterans or backed by ones.
