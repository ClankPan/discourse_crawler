I am seeking guidance on the steps required to launch SNS for a custom DApp. In the README of sns-testing repository, it’s mentioned that our DApp necessitates a deployment script that interacts with the replica via port 8080.

Here’s the link: Point 1 in the sns Life cycle [Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing#sns-lifecycle)

Could someone please provide a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in launching SNS for our custom DApp, including the utilization of the deployment script? Any additional guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

The [documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/) on our site is quite extensive. I suggest you start with the testing/local part (which the sns-testing repo does mostly automatically) and then move on to the launching/mainnet ones.
