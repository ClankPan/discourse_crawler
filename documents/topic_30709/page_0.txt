So I have a canister that is registered with the SNS and I want another SNS registered canister to be a controller on that canister.

How do I go about doing this?

I'm trying to test staking the treasury and the OpenFPL backend calls the neuron controller to stake it but it has been assigned to the SNS so the controller assertion fails:

Ignore me I just needed to use the string environment variable for the OpenFPL_backend and compare the principal that way.
