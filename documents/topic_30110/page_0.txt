I'm assuming there's a performance difference between using `debug_show` and `toText` type of APIs when formatting values as text within a Motoko canister, but has anyone benchmarked this to see just how much less efficient this is?

For example:
* Nats - `Nat.toText(n)` vs. `debug_show(n)`
* Errors - `Error.message(e)` vs. `debug_show(e)`
* Collections like Buffer - `Buffer.toText(b)` vs. `debug_show(b)`

If it's close, `debug_show` is just so much more convenient to use. 

I take pride in being a lazy developer by letting CoPilot write my code for me  :sunglasses: :desert_island:  

CoPilot definitely knows how to read my mind, completing my code with `debug_show` everywhere, but it consistently fumbles in using the right `toText` APIs for other types/collections.
