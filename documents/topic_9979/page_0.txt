When I get the storage canister id(qjdve-lqaaa-aaaaa-aaaeq-cai) by this:
```
dfx canister --network=ic call ockk2-xaaaa-aaaai-aaaua-cai block '(1763668)'
```
I can't find any method in the canister(qjdve-lqaaa-aaaaa-aaaeq-cai). How can I get the block in the storage canister?

Why do all the call return the same message?

That’s probably an error message, if you call the method from the canister’s Candid UI you’ll be able to see the response decoded:
[https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=ockk2-xaaaa-aaaai-aaaua-cai](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=ockk2-xaaaa-aaaai-aaaua-cai)

(That particular error is being forwarded on from the ledger canister’s block_pb protobuf endpoint, that’s the method that’s throwing the error.)

Re your original question and seeing the methods: They may not be showing up on that page because the storage canister is not serving up its own candid (via __get_candid_interface_tmp_hack), ic.rocks is checking for this to populate the page.

It return a canister id or principal, but when I use in command like this: 
```
dfx canister --network=ic call qjdve-lqaaa-aaaaa-aaaeq-cai block '(179886)'
```
it tells me no such method.

How can I get block in the storage canister?
