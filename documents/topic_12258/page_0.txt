If we rename `Motoko` to `Mot` it would work.

Joking aside, you could try the binaryen wasm-opt tool (or similar) to further reduce the code size. Or we could just move to SML.

My main problem is that I was referencing whole classes where a service would have been ok. I've resolved the issue. I think someone said we'll be able to upload zipped files in the future an that seems like a good solution. I like compacted code though, so anything you all can do to reduce the file size would be great.
