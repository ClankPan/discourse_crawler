Hello, my name is John Wiegley, and I'd like to request your vote on my upcoming proposal to add a named neuron.

Neuron ID: 12911334408382674412

# About Me

For a long while I've been a contributor to various open source projects and communities, including Emacs, Haskell, Ledger, C++, Common Lisp, Rust and Coq. You could say I'm a technology enthusiast, always looking to learn about new ideas and how they connect to real systems.

I worked at DFINITY from 2018-2022, exiting as Principal Engineer after nearly 4 years. While there, I worked on the execution engine, integration testing, devops infrastructure, transitioning from Haskell to Rust, the NNS, tokenomics, and various other aspects of the system. I knew the full stack fairly well, and had moved to the research side of the organization about a year before I left. This allowed me to work alongside most teams in the organization at one point or another.

# Voting

The neuron I'm proposing to name is the first neuron I staked, just a few weeks after initial launch. For most proposals I follow ICP Maximalist, but this is not how I always vote. I have a strong interest in seeing the Internet Computer become more decentralized and friendly to both its stakeholders and the public interest â€” and this is how I intend to vote.

# Disclaimer

Although I plan to always vote, whether manually or by following, I do not commit to any particular platform. I will vote my conscience and hold to what I, personally, think will serve the interests of the network and its users best.

Lets gooooo! @jwiegley glad to see you as a proposed named neuron. I will be voting yes.

I'm voting yes. The known neuron pool will be lucky to have you.

Thanks everyone for the support! The proposal is now live: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/79348

Hey @jwiegley, i think you accidentally submitted a motion proposal instead of a "register known neuron" one. See eg https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/78938, which has proposal type "register known neuron", while https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/79348 has type "motion". So I think that your proposal will not actually have direct effect if accepted.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-09-07 07:34:40 UTC | #10

Ah, you are right. I will submit another proposal after this motion proposal is closed.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-09-22 17:59:17 UTC | #11

Ok, here's the actual known neuron proposal :slight_smile:

And in case anyone is interested, I extended quill to permit sending these Motion and Known Neuron proposals. The implementation is not as satisfying as I'd hoped, so I could use review and feedback from any Rust developers out there: https://github.com/dfinity/quill/pull/134
