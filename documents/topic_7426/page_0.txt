The nns.ic0.app interface is quite basic, so it's difficult to figure out exactly how to achieve some things.
For example generating cycles from faucet.dfinity.org: If I were to generate the cycles using my dfx/laptop principal, I would be able to access/manipulate it via dfx.
But if I generate cycles using the Principal ID of my NNS account there is no obvious way to connect the resulting wallet to my NNS principal/account.  
How can I get access to a wallet whose controller is my NNS principal, from the NNS interface (or some other means)? I assume this wallet is "out there" somewhere...
