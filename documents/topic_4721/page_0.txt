July 12th 2021 edit: There is now an 'Increase Neuron Stake' button on each neuron in the NNS app which makes this whole process much easier!
___

We have just updated the NNS app (https://nns.ic0.app/).

In this new version, if you want to add ICP to an existing neuron, all you have to do is send ICP to the address that the original 'Stake Neuron' transaction went to and the neuron's balance will be refreshed automatically.

Here's an example of a neuron I just staked -

![Screenshot 2021-06-03 at 14.33.35|627x500](upload://hVs0YwRUsH6VBzbegwhNeH1JkUV.png)

In this example you can see that the 'Stake Neuron' transaction was sent to this account -
8b0777aea326d203647c235a14f2e6f73136a11f8421ef959e37dc2c7b4529ba

So to top up that neuron you can simply send more tokens to that same account.


Please note this only currently works for neurons created since May 19th since it requires the memo values which we did not store in the NNS app before that date. A fix for this will follow shortly (hopefully next week).

You can tell if the auto top up will work for your neuron by looking in your transactions list, and if the transaction is labelled as 'Stake Neuron', then the auto top-up will work, if not, it will still need to be done manually until the fix mentioned above goes live. For those that need to be done manually, please drop me a message and include your principal plus the account that the stake neuron transaction was sent to and I'll refresh the neuron's balance.

Thanks!

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-03 13:53:53 UTC | #2

Allow a minute or so after sending the ICP for a neuron's balance to be updated since these requests to refresh neuron balances are put into a queue and picked off by a background task.

Also, we don't currently auto refresh the neuron details while on the NNS app so you will need to refresh the page to get the latest data.

How to get a neuron address if I only have the neuron ID of those claimed instead of created through the NNS app?  Thanks.

-------------------------

dabzor420 | 2021-06-03 20:01:30 UTC | #4

Could i get a neuron refreshed it didn't seem to do it automatically.
principal id is : rhnl4-6v3wg-x3tnx-xgbja-l6rnu-7466q-6mlw3-hjher-qlyvk-udpmd-nae

I just found a bug for this new feature.  I sent  0.1495 ICP to the staked neuron account directly from exchange platform, KuCoin. The transaction records show that the amount has been topped up successfully.  The total amount became 	
12.157 ICP. But my wallet is still showing the old amount, 12.0075 ICP. 
Could you fix it? 
Here is my transaction records.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-03 22:34:24 UTC | #6

Can you try checking your neuron again, I'm just wondering if maybe a lot of people signed in an a large queue built up before yours got refreshed.

If it still hasn't been refreshed...
When did you stake the neuron?
Can you see the transaction in your history? If so, how is it labelled?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-03 22:41:31 UTC | #7

Can you also check your neuron again to see if maybe there was simply a delay?

If it's still not updated could you let me know the neuron Id + your principal (you can find this on the 'neurons' tab in the NNS app).

Thanks!

@AlexChien I'm not 100% sure what you mean... do you mean you have a neuron assigned to you from the airdrop? (I have no experience in this area)

-------------------------

dabzor420 | 2021-06-03 23:04:08 UTC | #8

Hi it still has not refreshed. I created the neuron at 3pm on May 13th. The transaction shows up as sent ICP

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-03 23:08:37 UTC | #9

Ah ok that makes sense then.

We'll have a fix for those older neurons hopefully before the end of next week but in the meantime I'll refresh yours manually.

I've tried using that memo value but it can't find the neuron, could you send me the address that the stake neuron transaction was sent to?

-------------------------

dabzor420 | 2021-06-03 23:17:53 UTC | #10

67c52af8ea4982776f7998f3fb381a306e19e236ae568aac73fd605155142dd5 is the neuron address

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-03 23:23:30 UTC | #12

Ok that should be refreshed now :+1:

-------------------------

AlexChien | 2021-06-04 06:02:11 UTC | #13

Yes, I have a bunch of neurons assigned to my principal from the seed round.  I am able to interact with these neurons.  When I am trying to top up these neurons with ICP (obtained from dissolved spawned neuron from maturity) to achieve a compound effect.  I can't find a way to find the corresponding Neuron address to send the ICP to.  I only have Neuron ID.  I've been searching the forum, it seems the way people are using is to find it from the NNS app transaction record which doesn't apply to my situation.

From the response from `get_full_neuron`, there's an `account blob` data, which I suspect might be useful.  But I don't know how to decode it into an address.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-04 10:39:10 UTC | #14

Found the issue!

I hadn't been handling the case where the transaction originated from an external account.

I've fixed that now and we'll hopefully get it out to live in the next few hours.

-------------------------

Hi hpeebles

What is the benefit of toping up a existing neuron vs. creating a new neuron? 

Thank you.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-04 11:03:38 UTC | #16

You can only spawn a new neuron once the voting rewards are at least 1 ICP.
So having a larger neuron means you are free to access the voting rewards sooner than having multiple smaller neurons.
Also, it's simpler to manage a single neuron.

-------------------------

kblbn | 2021-06-04 14:33:47 UTC | #17

Can you top up by directly transferring from an exchange?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-04 14:37:56 UTC | #18

Currently... no.

But I did the fix earlier today and it is included within proposal 3817 which is currently being voted on.

If you have a neuron go and vote yes! Haha

https://github.com/ic-association/nns-proposals/blob/main/proposals/network_canister_management/20210604T1601Z.md

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-04 14:42:21 UTC | #19

I'm really not sure about this I'm afraid.

But I think your best bet is to simply create a new neuron via the NNS app which you can subsequently top up whenever you'd like.

-------------------------

AlexChien | 2021-06-04 14:48:01 UTC | #20

That will work, thanks.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-04 15:56:50 UTC | #21

The proposal has been executed so now you can top up neurons directly from exchanges :partying_face:

-------------------------

gwopr | 2021-06-05 10:47:20 UTC | #22

thanks for the update!
my neurons were created just a few days before 19th May :-( looking forward to seeing the fix working...

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-06-06 02:47:41 UTC | #23

I wonder if you can get this information from the dashboard when you spawn a neuron and collect reward ICP.

-------------------------

Marakaya | 2021-06-10 19:04:26 UTC | #24

After adding tokens to the old neuron, the voting power increases, does the maturity zero or remains the same?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-10 19:15:31 UTC | #25

The maturity in absolute terms stays the same. But since it is displayed as a percentage of the total stake, that percentage will decrease.

-------------------------

Yes that address is correct. I think I may have misread/misunderstood what this?

Have you manually enabled my neuron so I can simply send my ICP to my existing neuron before the update gets pushed or Have you transferred my ICP from my wallet to my existing neuron?

Sorry for the silly question.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-11 10:35:47 UTC | #42

Ah ok I see what's happened.

The neuron's address is ef1b5000a2e197cbb285dd6e0f9064b94c62e050ec8fe16efbde4135b4c1d31f, you can see its balance here - https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/ef1b5000a2e197cbb285dd6e0f9064b94c62e050ec8fe16efbde4135b4c1d31f?p=1

You have sent more ICP to your Moses1 subaccount, but you need to now send it from that subaccount to the neuron's address.

Let me know once that is done and I'll refresh the neuron.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-11 10:39:27 UTC | #43

No-one other than you is able to send ICP from any of your accounts.

So in order to top-up a neuron you need to send ICP from your account to the neuron's address.

This really isn't intuitive!

We'll have a 'Top-Up' button ASAP next to each neuron but due to other priorities this hasn't happened yet :disappointed:

hpeebles | 2021-06-11 10:47:56 UTC | #46

It'll be the address that the original transaction to stake the neuron was sent to.

You should be able to find the transaction in your transaction history.

Then you can top up the neuron by sending more ICP to the same address.

Please be careful that you get the correct address!

Feel free to drop me a screenshot of your transaction history and I'll help you confirm the address.

But the maturity dropped

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-11 11:01:39 UTC | #51

Under the hood the maturity is a value defined in ICPs.

We display it as a percentage of the total stake on the UI.

So the underlying maturity value has remained the same but since the stake has increased the percentage we display has decreased.

Once this proposal is adopted, the NNS Dapp will resync all of the transactions made before May 19th in order to collect their memo values which are needed to detect the 'Stake Neuron' transactions. Once this re-sync is completed all neurons will auto refresh their balances so you'll no longer need to message me haha!

While we're at this please, the START UNLOCK button in the neuron app does not have a confirmation prompt.
If you accidentally hit it, it resets your maturity to zero. It actually happened to me while accessing it on the phone, with its small screen.
Please note it as an area of improvement.
Thanks

-------------------------

Clicking the start unlock button definitely shouldn't set your maturity to zero.
I've just had a look at the code and that doesn't seem to be possible.
Maybe a request failed which caused the UI to show 0 temporarily.
Can you check again now to see if it is still 0?

You can see the code here - https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L608

All it does is change the dissolve state. It definitely shouldn't have any effect on maturity!

Ok maybe that was indeed a UI issue, but it initiated my unlock even though I didn't intend to. Then I effectively cancelled the unlock and my maturity started counting up from zero again.

It happened a few weeks ago so I can't remember everything with certainty but it certainly initiated an unlock without confirmation. I wish I could demo it but i wouldn't want to.

This worked perfectly, and was so easy! Thank you.

The neuron‚Äôs ‚Äòage‚Äô would have been set to zero when you started to dissolve (unlock).  This will begin counting up again if you stop dissolving.

What will be the change in NNS app once the proposal is adopted and the code is executed?. How the users could identify it?

Thanks in advanceüëç

Hello Hamish,

Sorry to bother you again.

Can you do another refresh?

Looks like proposal 5771? I has been approved and executed.  So @hpeebles are we good to refresh our own neurons?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-17 16:54:32 UTC | #79

That's done!

@skilesare unfortunately yesterday's attempted fix didn't work since the code to pull in the memo values wasn't compatible with the ledger's archive canisters due to their API being slightly different to the main ledger canister (I think this will be changed so that they become exactly the same).

But I've now sorted that and there is a new proposal (5989) which contains this fix.

Once that gets executed (provided it works properly this time!) it will take ~3-4 hours to sync all of the past transaction data at which point you'll be able to add ICP to neurons created before May 19th.

You'll know once it's working by seeing that the original transaction to create the neuron is labelled as 'Stake Neuron' rather than 'Send ICP'. As soon as you see that, you're good to send more ICP to that same address to increase the neuron's stake.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-17 16:55:31 UTC | #80

This only visible difference will be that transactions to create neurons from before May 19th will be labelled as 'Stake Neuron' rather than simply 'Send ICP'.

-------------------------

kblbn | 2021-06-17 17:11:54 UTC | #81

Thank you!

Are there any plans to submit a proposal to disburse zero-balance neurons?

At this point if you try to disburse an unlocked neuron it just transfers the balance to your main account but the neuron just sits there with zero balance.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-17 17:22:28 UTC | #82

Zero balance neurons will get cleaned up shortly, that feature simply hasn't been done yet due to other priorities but it's a known issue :+1:

-------------------------

Saj_ICP | 2021-06-18 01:16:04 UTC | #83

Hi @hpeebles 

It worked well now, thank you. But the rewards to my neurons are not seen distributed yesterday. The maturity remains same and has no increase. It has been increasing everyday for the last 36 days. Why this?

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-06-18 04:00:23 UTC | #84

I noticed this too. Assume this is just a temporary display issue given the NNS canister upgrades voted on recently, but that‚Äôs worth confirming.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-18 14:02:06 UTC | #85

@Saj_ICP + @ayjayem the team in charge of the NNS have been looking into this and the fix has now gone live.

Update: https://status.internetcomputer.org/incidents/qht7b032tg54

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-18 12:21:37 UTC | #86

As of ~12 hours ago, all neurons created through the NNS Dapp should now refresh their balances automatically when additional ICP are sent to their addresses.

If anyone still has issues with this please send me a message and I'll have a dig into it.

-------------------------

kblbn | 2021-06-18 14:55:31 UTC | #87

Thank you for all your hard work Hamish.

-------------------------

Saj_ICP | 2021-06-18 15:19:07 UTC | #88

Yes, rewards have been updated on my end too. Thanks!

Where do I get this address? **Edit: I found it on the transaction list screen on the transaction where I staked the neuron.** 

The NNS is also putting off  this error about infinity times a second(almost makes the app unuseable). Starts when I click on one of my staked neurons.

hpeebles | 2021-06-19 12:12:55 UTC | #91

I've just had a look into this and can see the issue.

In the NNS Dapp the governance canister candid file is out of date and is causing it to attempt to read from a field that was removed a while ago.

I should be able to get a fix for this out tomorrow.

-------------------------

kblbn | 2021-06-19 12:47:32 UTC | #92

Can we top-up with a direct transfer from exchanges now?

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-06-19 16:53:10 UTC | #93

Yes it's been fixed for both early and new neurons.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-06-19 22:40:30 UTC | #94

Is there any issue with disbursing a newly-spawned neuron directly to another (locked and voting) neuron?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-21 20:26:02 UTC | #95

Any transaction to a neuron that was created via the NNS Dapp will result in the recipient neuron having its balance updated, so yes this will work

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-06-21 21:05:20 UTC | #96

Makes sense - thanks!

-------------------------

Marakaya | 2021-06-22 21:35:35 UTC | #97

Did I understand correctly that for a neuron created before May 19, I need to use Send, not a Stake? To add tokens to an old neuron.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-22 23:53:47 UTC | #98

In regards to topping them up, there is no longer a difference between neurons created prior to May 19th and those created after.

You need to look in your transaction history and find the ‚ÄòStake Neuron‚Äô transaction, then send additional ICP to that same address.

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-06-26 07:14:27 UTC | #99

Of course it doesn't matter where the top-up tokens come from right? It could come from an exchange and not necessarily my original wallet?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-26 07:26:45 UTC | #100

Yup. The source of the ICP doesn‚Äôt matter
