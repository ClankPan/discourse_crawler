I only see a single transaction to the neuron's address.

You can see the transactions to the neuron's address here - https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/4d3318c0e8761fb0e52bf84744c4bb1cf4367c4b8ac310c1bb8fa84b2fa3fa64

Which address did you send the 'top-up' transaction to?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-07-03 17:14:29 UTC | #103

Wanted to spawn a token but hit UNLOCK by mistake.  No warnings, amything, just unlock my 8 years by mistake.  Just lost my aging on this account.  Please add a Warning pop up, please!  Not too bad now but can be very costly if the account have 4 years...

Also, how can we get the account number from a Spawn neuron account?  Just made one lock for 8 years but cannot see the account anywhere in order to add in the future...

Thanks

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-07 14:46:29 UTC | #104

Good suggestion regarding showing a warning when clicking on 'Unlock', I've put that into our backlog :+1:

We have done the work to add an 'Increase Neuron Stake' button on each neuron which will show you the neuron's ledger account + allow you to easily send additional ICP to it.

This will hopefully go live before the end of this week.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-07-07 17:42:02 UTC | #105

Wow, millions thanks

Also, when click on the X in internet identity right of a device, it does delete the device instantly. Another Strong Warning would be appreciated as this may put some people in trouble

I love your work

@hpeebles  when sending more icp to a staked neuron from dfx can you use the neuron id as the destination address? so : 

```
dfx canister --network https://ic0.app --no-wallet call \
ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai send_dfx \
'(
    record { 
        memo = 1 : nat64; 
        amount = record {e8s = <AMOUNT_TO_SEND> : nat64}; 
        fee = record {e8s = 10_000 : nat64}; 
        to =  "<DESTINATION_ADDRESS>"
    }
)'
```

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-07 15:11:03 UTC | #107

No, you need to send the ICP to the neuron's ledger account address which is different to the neuron's Id.

Once the 'Increase Neuron Stake' button goes out to live that will make it easy to see the neuron's ledger address.

I'll post here once that happens. Hoooopefully that'll be tomorrow!

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-07-07 15:46:08 UTC | #108

I spawned a new neuron and when I lookup that neuron using the "neuron id" in ic.rocks the neurons account field is blank. what command in dfx displays the spawned neurons ledger account? 

I know how to get the neurons details with `get_full_neuron` and `get_neuron_info` but those commands don't display the neuron ledger account.  @hpeebles

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-07 16:47:18 UTC | #109

Normally I would say to find the 'Stake Neuron' transaction in your transaction list but that won't work for spawned neurons so I think your best bet is to wait until the 'Increase Neuron Stake' button is added.

I'll do whatever I can to get it out tomorrow!

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-07-07 17:00:46 UTC | #110

It was spawned from a seed neuron. I don't think it's possible to manage neurons spawned from seed neurons in the nns app.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-07 17:18:46 UTC | #111

Ahhh I see... unfortunately I have no experience with seed neurons so I can't help you there.

Feel free to raise a support ticket and those guys should be able to help you out.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-07-12 00:48:48 UTC | #113

i sent 1 icp to a seed neuron account number that is already staking icp. 

the neuron shows that the icp was received within the neuron balance of the neuron. 

but the 1 icp is not being staked within the neuron, it's only being shown in the balance of the neuron. 

using DFX, how do i stake that 1 icp within the neuron once it's already been shown to have been received within the neuron balance? 

This is a seed neuron so i can't manage it from with the UI within the NNS app so need to do it within DFX. The neuron is already staking ICP, but i want to add additional staked ICP to it. 

I read in the other thread that this command should work but since it's a seed neuron i don't know what to enter for the MEMO field since the memo appears to be 0 for the mint transaction, and then subsequent transactions where i sent icp to the neuron account number all have memo of 1. 

`dfx canister --network=http://ic0.app --no-wallet call governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account ‘(record {controller=principal “your principal Id”; memo=0 : nat64 })’`

I tried using memo=0 and also tried memo=1 and both returned: 

`"Account does not have enough funds to stake a neuron. Please make sure that account has at lease 1000000 e8s?`

Not sure why it says the account doesn't have enough funds because I sent 1 icp to the neuron and then sent a second transaction of 0.1 icp in case 1 icp wasn't enough taking into account fees. 

i just want to stake more icp to the pre-existing neuron. is there a min amount of ICP needed to use when increasing staked icp in an existing neuron? why does it return that the account doesn't have enough funds when the account balance shows that there 1.1 icp was received within the account but just isn't being staked? 

@cryptoschindler @hpeebles @Ori

@hpeebles I raised a support ticket and they directed me to this thread.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-12 15:37:40 UTC | #115

I know that support for managing seed neurons via dfx is being worked on. I've just asked when this functionality will be available. Once I know more I'll post an update here.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-12 15:43:46 UTC | #116

There is now an 'Increase Neuron Stake' button on each neuron in the NNS app :partying_face:

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-07-12 15:50:51 UTC | #117

Great thanks. Let me know when you have some additional details. Just to confirm: it's currently not possible to increase the amount of staked ICP in a seed neuron? But it will be in the future ? Thanks

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-12 20:31:36 UTC | #118

Will do!

And yup exactly that :ok_hand:

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-07-12 21:51:52 UTC | #119

Well done, but now you have to reduce the width of the buttons. They're now flowing out of the window frame.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-07-12 22:56:59 UTC | #120

QUESTIONS:  

Does increasing a Dissolve delay or adding some ICP to an existing neurons affect the neuron's aging?

Is Aging showing somewhere?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-12 22:59:35 UTC | #121

Yes, the neuron's 'age' is the average age of the ICP contained within it.

So if you have a neuron with 10 ICP with an age of 2 years, then you add another 10 ICP, the age will now be 1 year.

This means that the aging bonus in absolute terms will be the same immediately before and immediately after the additional tokens are added.

We don't display the age in the NNS app, we should do though, I'll see what we can do about showing it.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-07-12 23:13:30 UTC | #122

Showing the Aging and the account number associated with the neuron (with copy-paste function) would be really nice.

thanks!

-------------------------

hairycat | 2021-07-19 01:24:54 UTC | #123

@hpeebles , thanks for this thread. I tried the increase neuron stake using the new button, and it didn't update the amount of ICP displayed in the neuron on nns, despite waiting a couple days. Could you please help me with this? This is the transaction hash: 83045b3c4504685aba368a0a0cc49e76c423c359c195c6b557d861f13e97bb92
Thanks!

-------------------------

hairycat | 2021-07-19 01:28:44 UTC | #124

I think it didn't update because the neuron that I increased the stake on was created 6/15 (before 6/19). The neuron # is 5693716811461854478 and principal ID is n6yy2-j5has-dbypr-bce5j-6zql3-4zcem-dlcbq-c6suv-by7wn-hy46n-yae

Thanks again!

> I know that support for managing seed neurons via dfx is being worked on. I’ve just asked when this functionality will be available. Once I know more I’ll post an update here.

Did you end up getting a response on this eta to support managing seed neurons via dfx?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-19 10:33:10 UTC | #126

Ah I see what has happened. This neuron was created via disbursing an existing neuron.

Neurons created this way (+ seed neurons) can't currently be refreshed using the same method as neurons created through the usual process.

Support for this is coming soon but the person implementing it is away for another week so I can't give an accurate estimate. I'll post in here once I know more though.

@aaa10247 this is the timeline you're after too.

-------------------------

Bapakeanak2 | 2021-07-19 18:45:21 UTC | #127

can you help me enter my icp in my old NNS account? I used a new NNS account because I failed to login in various ways, none of them worked, so I couldn't buy a yubikey, and I replied to an email to the ICP guide with Robert Bodily also it seems he doesn't can you help me, my old account's NNS wallet address is still there, can I check on my binance account, to enter my old NNS account balance into my new NNS account, thanks in advance

-------------------------

MiniWinks | 2021-07-20 02:44:01 UTC | #128

Hi, I just increased my stake about 2 hours ago and the amount of ICP in the Neurons is not updated. Likely mine is one of the older neurones and require manual updating.

My Principle ID is hykyc-6qs3t-bar3y-7dbob-pimxp-4rjny-cn35i-5vhyr-e4ebj-de4m7-oae

Memo is 1230289953267954234


Also, do I still have to approach you for manual updating should I increase my stake again in future?

-------------------------

MiniWinks | 2021-07-20 06:10:13 UTC | #129

 The above transaction was done using seed neurons.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-07-20 16:38:31 UTC | #130

@Bapakeanak2 the only possible way to access that ICP is to gain access to the account which owns the ICP.
It is probably worth firing a request over to the support team and explaining why you can no longer log in.
They may be able to to help you out.

@MiniWinks support for seed neurons is coming in the next few weeks. Until that time there is nothing that we can do. But don't worry your tokens are still safe! And once the seed neuron support is live we will be able to refresh the balance of the neuron.

-------------------------

MiniWinks | 2021-07-20 21:49:01 UTC | #131

Thanks, @hpeebles.
I'm more reassured now. Until ICP solves the problem, will the neuron continue accrue maturity (aka rewards)? There is a matter of opportunity costs here.

Also, can you drop me a message when support does arrive? Thanks!

-------------------------

Junkfarm | 2021-07-21 01:20:11 UTC | #132

I'm curious why my neurons stopped maturing recently.  All three stopped 3 days ago and there's been lots of voting going on.  They're all staked for more than a year and had been maturing daily untill recently.

-------------------------

Hi, Would you know a way to top up a neuron via command line, not the nns? For example, I spawn a neuron, dissolve it, and then I'd like to add to ICP to the original neuron?

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-07-31 11:43:42 UTC | #134

It's not possible to do that currently

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-08-07 10:51:00 UTC | #138

Any news on the time for this feature to be released?

Hi @hpeebles I am wondering if you can help me with a problem please? I have topped up a neuron today and it was on the loading screen for a long time. I refreshed the page and it shows the ICP has been sent to the neuron but it is not appearing in my neuron. I sent the ICP to 91ca4e3cf81b9f7c7f85f489b403981895b79cf4e68ee7b1cc5a8de39b8401e5

hpeebles | 2021-08-11 19:04:57 UTC | #141

I've just been chasing about this and have been told that we are aiming to get the fix out to production tomorrow.

The NNS Dapp will be adjusted to use this new method for refreshing neurons in a few days time but for now I will do it manually.

I'll post in here once I've refreshed each of your neurons :+1:

-------------------------

Hello hpeebles,
i really hope you can help me. Im a student and invested a in ICP. 
Just could skate my fist neuron and sent it to main wallet. There i got another 18 Coins i wantet to stake. Also i toped up and then an error arised. I loged out and in and could see it choosed the same adress i recived my neuron. Now i cant see my 19 icp-coins anywhere. Thats really alot money for me and i hope you can help me out or know what i could do?

I think its the same problem swedishlalala had.
My principal id is: 
Neurons: Your principal id is "yj7kg-kavee-u22ud-pcowi-cyea5-fcufj-mmmcb-re6ta-ymhw7-x33uq-dqe"
Its sent to the recived Neurons adress "2a309510c1f81504d2d0bcb0b0c44506f9e72e97973d058537fae510cafc7932"

i really hope you can help me out. you would be my heroe. Thanks for helping.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-08-17 14:32:37 UTC | #145

Yes! Once the change that is going through review has gone out to production all neurons will be able to be refreshed.

@Swedishlalala I can see you sent the ICP to a newly spawned neuron's address. We can't currently refresh balances for newly spawned neurons but your ICP is safe and we will be able to refresh the balance shortly.

@HiPZzTR_1 you're right its the same issue and will be fixed soon. Your ICP is completely safe so don't worry!

Can you manually refresh my Neuron please ? I topped using the ' increase stake' button, but the transaction is not showed as a top-up neuron, where when I just send them regularly to a neuron-address, the transaction is showed up as a top-up Neuron.  Also I tried sending 6 ICP to the neuron with a regular transaction, and ICP's not shown up. a total of 133 ICP is now vanished

my principal id is "qicuh-vu56j-a3xtd-5vhrz-qh4bo-ob33p-aj52r-oltyk-bvso2-6zqqe-wae"

So I tried twice with the increase stake button, and once with a regular transaction, all vanished

please help

I know it’s been a long time coming… but the code which will allow us to refresh all of these neurons was merged in earlier today.

The NNS team are hoping to get it pushed out to production tomorrow at which point we will be able to refresh the balance of any neuron regardless of how it was created.

We have a list of neurons which we know require a balance refresh.

I’ll post an update here once we’ve worked through that list. If after that time anyone’s neuron still requires a refresh, please drop me a message and I’ll sort it :+1:

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-08-26 22:43:51 UTC | #148

The code which allows all neurons to be refreshed has now gone out to production.
I didn't realise this would be the case but in the new code we need to know the neuronId in order to perform the refresh.
I've just refreshed the neurons for which I knew the neuronId but if anyone's neuron still needs refreshing please send me the neuronId and I'll sort it.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-08-26 22:50:39 UTC | #149

Also, now that the governance canister allows us to refresh the balance of any neuron, next week we will put out an update to the NNS Dapp which will make use of this new functionality automatically so that all neurons will able to be topped up with no manual intervention.

-------------------------

and thank you for the working and help mate.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-08-31 23:05:11 UTC | #161

From the looks of it you spawned a neuron, then waited 7 days for it to dissolve, then sent the ICP to your main account, then used the 'Increase Neuron Stake' functionality to top up a neuron.

At this point it looks like it sent the ICP back to your newly dissolved neuron which you just sent the ICP from and which now has a stake of 0.

I'll raise this with the team tomorrow and between us we'll be able to see how this has happened.

It should be fairly simple to get the ICP back by simply refreshing the zero balance neuron. We just need to find out the details for it.

I'll get back to you ASAP once we know more.

1 thing I can guarantee though is that your ICP is definitely safe! :+1:

-------------------------

HiPZzTR_1 | 2021-09-01 11:13:23 UTC | #162

Nice to hear, i war really confused what happend. But i see you understand and youre able to look with your team. Well im happy to stake it to my other ones. Thx dude :)

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-09-01 14:30:36 UTC | #163

Ok I now fully understand what has happened and have done a fix which will hopefully go live before the end of this week.

You disbursed a neuron to your main account (upon disbursing we should hide the old neuron's details but we don't currently), you then clicked 'Increase Neuron Stake' on the neuron which you just disbursed which now has a balance of 0, you then sent ICP to it's account.

This neuron was a newly spawned neuron which we don't currently refresh automatically. This meant the neuron's balance wasn't refreshed and so is still 0 ICP which is why it is hidden.

I've just made a change which will query the ledger to check each neuron's balance (even if the neuron stake was 0), if any mismatches are detected it will send a request to the governance canister to refresh the neuron, once this is done it will reload the neuron so that the front end displays the latest details.

This will work for all neurons regardless of how they were created.

I'll let you know once the fix is live, at which point you'll see your neuron with the missing ICP in the NNS Dapp.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-09-02 14:15:55 UTC | #164

Are rewards calculated correctly even though the neuron balance isnt being displayed correctly (neuron hasnt been refreshed after topping it up)?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-09-03 10:26:53 UTC | #165

If you want to refresh your neurons yourself, here is an "easier" way to do so:

1. Head over to the Candid UI for the Governance Canister [here](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai)

2. Open the menu and select the `manage_neuron` method

4. Hit the `Call` button

After a few seconds you should refresh the NNS UI to be able to see that the Neuron balance indeed has been refreshed!

Hey guys I wanted to top-up my new spawned neuron but when I increased neuron stake it did not top-up but icp was transfered. Also in transactions it is not Top-up Neuorn but Sent ICP. So it seems ICP is lost or it will appear in neuron in some time?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-09-03 14:13:32 UTC | #167

try this and see if the neuron balance refreshes

l0st0 | 2021-09-04 07:15:56 UTC | #168

It works thank you man!

-------------------------

The rewards are calculated within the governance canister.
When you top up a neuron you increase its account balance in the ledger canister.
But until the governance canister knows about this the stake displayed and also the rewards received will be based on the old ICP amount.

We were hoping to get the fix for these top up issues on Friday but we had to delay in the end as there are quite a few pending changes and not all of them were fully tested in time.

But I'm fairly confident we'll get it out tomorrow (Monday), this release will also include a button to 'Merge Maturity' which will allow you to reinvest rewards straight back into the neuron.

This will be a manual process at first but there are plans to make it automatic i the not too distant future.

-------------------------

HiPZzTR_1 | 2021-09-06 00:11:08 UTC | #171

Wow that sounds really cool. This is a huge project and i dont regret it that i investet half my money in it as a student. Hope it will work.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-09-06 08:01:51 UTC | #172

So you basically loose rewards if you don't refresh the neuron inmediately?

Are there any plans to release a feature - merge neurons?

-------------------------

HiPZzTR_1 | 2021-09-06 15:23:10 UTC | #174

What do you understand with merge? 
Accumulate the staking?

Thats what i did today instead of spawning the neuron. But im not sure if it worked.

-------------------------

Rxke | 2021-09-06 15:39:54 UTC | #176

not sure if off topic but... small typo: one can 'merge maturity'...

when you click confirm it says : This will merge xx% of your neuron's earned maturity into it's stake


*its   :)

-------------------------

alexander | 2021-09-06 16:02:29 UTC | #177

I have got two neurones. X ICPs first, Y ICPs second. Both neurones locked for 8 years. I have created them when increase stake neurone was not possible. Now I would like to merge these two neurones and have only one with the stake (X + Y) for 8 years.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-09-06 17:24:20 UTC | #178

@hpeebles Thanks for Merge Maturity button.  This is great.  But we will need a STOP MATURITY MERGING button as well.  I will want to increase my stake neuron with new rewards for now but it was my plan to send the rewards somewhere else  (or cash them) at a later date.
Thanks again.  All great improvments

-------------------------

HiPZzTR_1 | 2021-09-06 17:41:05 UTC | #179

i could spawn a neuron but i clicked on merge. Now i cant spawn anymore. Is it the same like top up? 

like alexander wrote makes more sense for me. Adds all icp from different adresses together to one.

-------------------------

dsickles | 2021-09-06 19:13:48 UTC | #180

I just sent ~1 ICP from a dissolved spawned neuron to a staked neuron. The dissolved neuron disappeared as expected but the ICP is not in the target neuron (~15 minutes at this point). I have previously done this by sending to one my account wallets first and this has always worked. I thought why not go direct to the target neuron? Should this have worked? Is it not able to extract the fee cycles? With the source neuron gone, how do I trace this?

-------------------------

dsickles | 2021-09-06 19:54:19 UTC | #181

Refreshing the target neuron with the Candid UI did not work. Maybe it was sent back to the spawned neuron as mentioned in another post but the spawned neuron is not visible.

-------------------------

dsickles | 2021-09-06 20:18:31 UTC | #182

[quote="hpeebles, post:163, topic:4721"]
I’ve just made a change which will query the ledger to check each neuron’s balance (even if the neuron stake was 0), if any mismatches are detected it will send a request to the governance canister to refresh the neuron, once this is done it will reload the neuron so that the front end displays the latest details.
[/quote]

It appears that I may have this problem (see post below). If, for whatever reason, ICP is returned to a 0  stake spawned neuron, how long should I expect to wait for the governance canister to be notified and refresh?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-09-06 20:28:16 UTC | #183

Wow, interesting! You can merge maturity at any point in a neuron's lifecycle, even when the accrued maturity isn't at 1 ICP yet?

Is there any downside to clicking "Merge Maturity" in the NNS app? Seems like I should constantly merge 100% for all my neurons whenever I have time.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-09-07 08:18:02 UTC | #184

Just realize "merge maturity" has to be triggered manually. Taught it was automatic everyday until you stop it. Mixed reality with a dream 😁

-------------------------

HiPZzTR_1 | 2021-09-12 04:47:19 UTC | #185

Is there a way to top up the different neurons adresses?
I got 4 adresses and want all in my main adresses where im staking.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-09-12 09:26:23 UTC | #186

I have a different issue. 4 neurons,  8 years lock up, different ICPs. Wanting to merge into one neuron.

-------------------------

bobbylingus | 2021-09-15 17:06:31 UTC | #187

Does 'Merge Maturiry' affect neuron age bonus? We know that increasing neuron stake does affect the age right?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-09-20 16:47:36 UTC | #188

The 'age' of a neuron is based on the average length of time the ICP has been staked.

So as you add new ICP to a neuron, that new ICP has an 'age' of 0 so the age bonus (as a percentage) will decrease, but in absolute terms it stays the same.

-------------------------

bobbylingus | 2021-09-22 09:48:22 UTC | #189

So merging the maturity means adding 0-age ICP, which brings the average age down.

So the answer is yes :slight_smile: 

Can we speak of neuron age having the units of TIME/ICP? The average time staked per unit ICP?

-------------------------

wgfernandes_BR | 2021-09-23 06:53:11 UTC | #190

Hi,

Can you manually refresh my Neuron, please? I topped up about 7000 ICP hoping to reduce the dissolve delay of one of the seed neurons I have.

my principal id is “v7cc2-wbjf7-dloyx-43km2-ive2v-qcyno-edull-b4c73-jdllb-haoqj-7ae”

neuron ID: 7426475773933408710

Thanks

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-09-23 16:49:03 UTC | #191

@wgfernandes_BR Please check now, that should be done :+1:

-------------------------

wgfernandes_BR | 2021-09-24 19:27:02 UTC | #192

Thank you very much for the quick response!
But why the dissolve delay was not reduced proportionally?

Seed investors cannot have the dissolve delay of theirs neurons reduced?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-09-24 21:46:25 UTC | #193

There is no way to speed up the dissolving of a neuron.

If you increase the stake of a neuron the dissolve delay remains the same.

-------------------------

wgfernandes_BR | 2021-09-25 07:45:48 UTC | #194

Thanks!
Sorry, my mistake. 
I mixed up the idea that the age of the neuron would be changed after the top-up and thought that the same would happen with the dissolve delay.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-09-29 23:51:56 UTC | #195

I thought this thread may be interested in this:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/soft-launch-improved-ic-staking-documentation-and-experience/7623

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-10-11 13:49:40 UTC | #196

Quick question, are you still working at combining and splitting neurons? 
Combining to clean up our account because creating multiple neurons was the only way to dissolve some but not all ICP.
Splitting to be able to start dissolve a certain amount of ICP only.
Thanks

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-10-17 22:43:41 UTC | #197

Sorry for the super slow reply! This message somehow slipped under my radar!

Splitting neurons is already actually supported by the IC so it should be fairly easy to add a button to the NNS Dapp allowing users to do this. Merging isn't supported by the IC yet though, so that won't be available via the NNS Dapp any time soon.

I'll speak to the NNS team tomorrow and ask them about both of these features.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-10-17 22:57:55 UTC | #198

The merge function would be very appreciated.
Thanks for following up

-------------------------

Renaissanceman777 | 2021-12-05 02:17:11 UTC | #199

Hey is it possible for you to merge ALL of my neurons into one ? If so, how can I do this ? Thanks in advance 🙏🏼

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-12-13 15:45:07 UTC | #200

This isn't supported yet, but it is on the roadmap and should be available in the next month or so.

-------------------------

Renaissanceman777 | 2021-12-14 07:21:28 UTC | #201

Thank you 🙏🏼 I appreciate the prompt response
