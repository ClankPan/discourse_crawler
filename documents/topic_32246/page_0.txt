I have been struggling to access my locally running canisters from LAN. I want to access canisters through the ```192.168.1.49:8000```. I've added this setting in the ```dfx.json``` : 
```
"networks": {
    "local": {
      "bind": "192.168.1.49:8000",
      "type": "ephemeral",
      "replica": {
        "subnet_type": "system"
      }
    }
  }
```
but I get this error trying to access the canister (on my ubuntu machine): 
```
An error happened in Candid canister:
v: Server returned an error:
  Code: 400 ()
  Body: subnet_not_found

```
on my Mac Book I get this error instead (no I'm not accessing the same canister through the Mac book it has its on local replica running): 
```
An error happened in Candid canister:
r@http://192.168.1.3:8000/index.js:2:10398
D@http://192.168.1.3:8000/index.js:2:14599
@http://192.168.1.3:8000/index.js:2:28049
```
it works fine if I bind it to ```127.0.0.1``` though in that case I can't access it through my ip address or on my LAN
