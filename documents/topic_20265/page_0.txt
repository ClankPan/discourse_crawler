I know I already shared news about my project two days ago on the forum, but I'm thrilled to announce another exciting feature! ðŸ‘‰ You can now easily deploy to the Internet Computer using GitHub Actions with Juno ðŸš€

Blog post and documentation: [https://juno.build/blog/deploy-to-the-internet-computer-using-github-action-with-juno](https://juno.build/blog/deploy-to-the-internet-computer-using-github-action-with-juno)

Example:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Juno

on:
  release:
    types: [released]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Juno
        uses: buildwithjuno/juno-action@main
        with:
          args: deploy
        env:
          JUNO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JUNO_TOKEN }}
```
