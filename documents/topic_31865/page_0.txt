Dear @AlexNascimentoUCLA,

We are happy to award you this grant.

However, it'd be great if you could provide more insights on why such a platform should be built on a decentralized computing platform such as ICP, since you are mainly relying on single centralized platforms (e.g. mempool.space) for data ingestion.

It would also be interesting to learn more how the projects that are building on Bitcoin could benefit from Panorama Block.

Thank you very much Dom - we really appreciate the support from ICP!

Apologies for the delayed response, as we were focused on developing and I ended up missing your message. We are happy to share that we have been making significant progress recently. 

Given our values on privacy, decentralization, and community we see the opportunity of building on IC perfectly aligning with our mission focused on security and data reliability, which centralized platforms do not offer.

Currently, we are using mempool as a way to extract data for our POC developments, but in the near future we would like to run our own BTC node and extract data directly from the BTC chain.

Panorama Block is focused in providing users, including developers, entrepreneurs, and institutional clients, accurate, trustless on-chain data, benefiting the entire L1/L2 ecosystems, and ultimately becoming a reliable "source of truth" across various chains.

Utilizing the architecture of the Internet Computer, we can offer unparalleled benefits for our platform users. 

The ICâ€™s ability to scale infinitely will allow us to handle vast amounts of data efficiently and securely, and its decentralized nature ensuring fault tolerance and high availability, will provide our users with continuous, uninterrupted access to valuable real-time insights and metrics. Additionally, the support for asynchronous messaging will be amazing for our communication and data exchange across different subnets, especially in regards to reliability and responsiveness of our services.

On the user experience side, we see great value in the integration of Internet Identity in our platform given its significant advantages of enhancing the security of user authentication, reducing the risks associated with traditional password-based systems. Therefore, we can offer our users a more secure and streamlined login experience, ensuring their data is protected and access to our platform is both convenient and safe.

Our focus on trustless data and Bitcoin block data aims to map insights and metrics within the Bitcoin network helping other BTC projects, as well as developers, entrepreneurs and institutional users to build on top of our well organized and indexed data sets and take advantage of the insights generated from analyzing various metrics of the BTC network. Moreover, our expansion plans include doing the same on-chain data aggregation to cover various niches in Web3, including other chains, DEXs, NFTs, and protocols, among others, ensuring reliable analytics for all users.

Sorry for the long answer, but I hope this helps better explain our project, and please let me know if I can answer any other question.

Many thanks for your support, we greatly appreciate it!

-Alex

Given your focus on privacy, decentralization, and providing trustless on-chain data, how do you plan to address potential challenges in maintaining data integrity and accuracy when transitioning from using mempool data to running your own BTC node for direct data extraction?
