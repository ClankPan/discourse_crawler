While reading through the [SNS proposals](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals)  documentation I noticed few deadlinks:

> See more [general security best practices](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/blob/master/docs/developer-docs/security/general-security-best-practices.md).

404 -> https://github.com/dfinity/portal/blob/master/docs/developer-docs/security/general-security-best-practices.md

> Therefore, the command to [submit a proposal](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/docs/cli-reference/sns/quill-sns-make-proposal.md) `sns make-proposal`

404 -> https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/docs/cli-reference/sns/quill-sns-make-proposal.md 

> use the specially-made [`make-upgrade-canister-proposal`](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/docs/cli-reference/sns/quill-sns-make-upgrade-canister-proposal.md) command

404 -> https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/docs/cli-reference/sns/quill-sns-make-upgrade-canister-proposal.md

There might be other, just few links I clicked.

Hope that helps.
