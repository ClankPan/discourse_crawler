(As a clarification, all mentions of DFINITY in this post refer to the DFINITY neuron, and not the entire DFINITY organization or its employees)

# Motivation

Recently, the https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-80970-spam-proposal-and-86639-temperature-check/16156, specifically their "yes" vote on the Temperature check spurred a lot of debate around not just the contents of each proposal, but why the DFINITY neuron would actively support or vote against such proposals.

The goal of this discussion is think through the introduction of an active ABSTAIN option, such that a neuron can actively abstain from voting on a governance proposal without forfeiting their governance rewards.

This would allow all voters and neurons, including DFINITY to fully support and/or reject the proposals they vote on without reservations, and to actively ABSTAIN from voting on proposals for which they are neutral, conflicted, or do not have a strong opinion.

<br/>


# Discussion and Open Questions

The goal of this discussion is to explore ways to introduce the option to actively ABSTAIN from voting as an option without introducing unnecessary complexity of implementation or negatively affecting the security of the NNS.

To clarify, actively voting to ABSTAIN is **not** the same as failing to vote on a proposal, as the active option will still earn voters rewards, whereas the latter will not.

With respect to abstaining affecting the security of the NNS (voting to ABSTAIN instead of voting NO makes it easier to pass a proposal), I believe there are certain voter percentage threshold values which @bjoernek may be aware of that will not impact the quick passage of code updates. Today, over 90% of NNS voting power still follows DFINITY on non-governance proposal topics which pass instantly when the DFINITY neuron votes.

Implementing this feature opens several questions, one of which is whether or not a tally of ABSTAIN votes should be kept track of, and what the outcome should be if the majority vote to ABSTAIN (should this outweigh the yes votes)?.

For example, if the NNS has a vote that is 33% YES, 30% NO, and 37% ABSTAIN, should the proposal be accepted or rejected?


I‚Äôm sure there are many more edge cases and side effects (such as a higher proposal accept or reject rate) that might be introduced by adding such an ABSTAIN option, which is why I‚Äôm hoping to flush out and resolve those issues in this discussion before potentially submitting a proposal once the idea is more mature.


<br/>

# Additional Context

According to @diegop, the DFINITY foundation's reasoning for voting in favor is as follows:

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:16156"]
We voted YES because we did not want to discourage people from discussing technical or governance topics. We thought that if we voted NO or ABSTAINED it would be tantamount to snuffing out the fragile flame of discussion within the community. After all, DFINITY members have been largely absent from the conversations around NNS Treasury. We like seeing the community get involved more and more.
[/quote]


This statement gives the impression that DFINITY did not have a firm stance on the Temperature Check issue other than to simply continue the conversation and not "shoot down" the idea. 

Not having a decisive opinion or reason to vote one way or another, but still voting a certain way can end up padding the votes of a true "temperature check" put out to the NNS community, and in the case of a neuron with VP as large as DFINITY's, their indecision will sway or swing most votes.

While any neuron has the right to vote as they please, they should also not be forced into voting for or against a proposal purely to receiving voting rewards - the financial losses that come from abstaining, specifically with a neuron as large as DFINITY's are significant.


To dig into this piece of DFINITY's statement:
[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:16156"]
We thought that if we voted NO or ABSTAINED it would be tantamount to snuffing out the **fragile flame** of discussion within the community.
[/quote]

If DFINITY has a desire to **actively** vote to abstain without forfeiting governance rewards, they should be able to do so - as should any neuron. I hope that DFINITY never feels that the IC community is helpless or is a **fragile flame**, and that they need to vote one way or another in order to "prop up" the community. 

This is an additional reason why the NNS should have an active ABSTAIN button that will allow DFINITY or any neuron to more easily take a position of neutrality - after all, this is a Swiss foundation we‚Äôre talking about üòè

My personal opinion is that even if the ABSTAIN have a majority, that the YES to NO ratio should be the only part of the vote that is counted towards its accept/reject outcome, ensuring that at the very least the minimum voter participation is passed. This is because in a pathological scenario, all NO voters could now just switch to ABSTAIN in order to reject a proposal.

dfisher | 2022-11-08 04:32:22 UTC | #6

This is a brilliant idea. 

Personally, I think ABSTAIN should not impact the yes or no votes. If 70% vote ABSTAIN, 1.9% vote no, and 2% vote yes, I believe it should still pass.

I still believe there still be some minimum % acceptance criteria. I believe that the current approval threshold for a proposal to pass is 3%.

For example, in the case you provided, a 2% approval (with 70% abstain) would be far too low in my opinion, as it could provide potential vulnerability or attack vector if the approval threshold is too low.

No, the NNS votes on binary proposals, not a series of different candidate outcomes. Therefore, ranked choice voting does not make much sense in this context.

Abstain is simply an option to actively refuse to vote yes or no on a proposal, and should not be interpreted as an extension to the binary outcome of NNS proposals.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-11-08 09:08:02 UTC | #9

There are not 3 candidates, only yes or no. These are very clear to me but a abstain says something different otherwise you would just select no which has been the case for me with any spam.

Maybe a proposal is considered concerning or alarming and should have a weighting even to the yes or no vote that say's this proposal is not right and should be flagged for inspection with no action if it's count is higher.

I think the listed examples wrt DFINITY's voting on 80970 and 86639 wouldn't really benefit from this proposal, because DFINITY wanted to vote yes on them, but their vote was just misunderstood / not explained well enough (because the first casually mentions "abandoned ICP" but leaves it to a future proposal, and the second did not ask if you're in favor of an NNS treasury, but whether you think it should be explored more, both of these things were misunderstood as saying DFINITY is in favor of an NNS treasury funded that way, which was not the intent). 

Outside of that, I see the appeal of an abstain button, but on the other hand I think it's a bit dangerous: it would then be way too easy to hit the abstain button eg if you didnt have time to fully read up on it or didn't completely understand everything. I worry that proposals could then accidentally pass, because the majority of the voting power abstained. I'd rather see the ICP ecosystem move to a policy where you vote yes if you're very convinced that the proposal is good, and vote no otherwise (irrespective of whether that meant you think it's a bad idea or you just didnt understand all the details, or you think it's too early etc).

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-11-08 13:12:09 UTC | #12

Since governance proposals don‚Äôt actually have any power and can‚Äôt affect any change, I‚Äôd prefer to see the weight dropped to 0 so that not voting doesn‚Äôt affect rewards and we can get true temperature checks(that is all any of them are).

The topic should be changed to ‚Äúmotions‚Äù or some other name(maybe from Robert‚Äôs rules of order‚Ä¶whatever means non-binding resolution). If you vote when you don‚Äôt have to you likely do care about the item and we can better gauge community interest.

Adding abstain for proposals that do affect change enables a stalemate scenario that could cause gridlock.

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2022-11-08 13:21:18 UTC | #13

Again another proposal to change the narrative of the NNS,

are'nt the rewards called "governance rewards" meaning you earn ICP by participating in the governance put forth by the NNS, by adding "abstain" the narrative will change and it wont be about govenrance anymore its just i guess proof of stake? except the staked ICP is essentially doing nothing (not securing the chain, not participating in governance) its just a waste and a meaningless money grab in this scenario.

Whats stopping everyone from just abstaining from every proposal because its easier and less work and you will just get the same ICP rewards?

We will essentially have a pool of stakers that do nothing in this scenario except drain ICP, I will vote no

Slightly off topic, but I echo this sentiment and would support such a change. However, I wonder what this would do to the engagement of the IC community with the NNS, especially 8 year stakers who have seen their rewards dwindle over the past few months.

I half agree with this sentiment, but on the other hand the followee system is currently set up as a permanent ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù system. Having someone buy ICP, log in, and follow a neuron like DFINITY or Synapse is much easier than logging in on a specific proposal to actively hit the ABSTAIN button.

If we look at the current situation with all technical proposals (non-governance proposals), this is the exact case I am describing. Not one named neuron is actively voting on System Canister Management, Subnet Management, etc. proposals. They are all following DFINITY and passively collecting rewards. 

Maybe a solution to this is that DFINITY needs to hire a technical writer to more elaborately describe what is being passed in each non-governance proposal so that this is more digestible by the community.

So I ask, if a neuron takes the time to log into the NNS dashboard and vote on a specific proposal, why not give that neuron the option to actively abstain? 

If I deeply understand both sides of an argument and am actually neutral on an proposal, is it possible that blindly delegating your vote in this case of true neutrality is actually padding one side of a proposal vote, and could do more harm through passive voting power or voter apathy?

Named neurons that choose to abstain will probably lose followers, so this is a self-enforcing mechanism that already incentivizes named neurons to take a stance.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-11-08 18:08:44 UTC | #15

I see Abstain as benefiting the active sides of voting outcome (yes/no) depending on the weights. Having to take a clear position of yes or no induces a more hands on thinking process, while having the abstain option many could use for many reasons as it is more advantageous from a resource allocation point of view. Get the same benefits with less resources allocated to research, debate and consume energy on the probabilities. 

But a No with Veto (which weights more than simple No) would be interesting. As there are gradients mostly in how strong people oppose something. 
voting is a matter of cost allocation vs the benefits of the outcome, and for many reasons people either can not compute the outcome, or in many cases the cost distribution is unequal and there are more reasons for the No (reject) side than for the Yes (accept) side.

This would be a problem for system upgrades and other proposals which result in immediate on chain actions if they pass, but for governance it is a feature and not a bug imo. I'd rather have voters abstain than mindlessly press yes/no and muddy the waters. I doubt the lack of an abstain button will convince them to do more accurate considerations before voting.

I believe abstain could be useful for temperature checks proposals, it provides more details on the current consensus around certain topics: does part of the community oppose the proposal or are they neutral towards it for lack of knowledge or interest? 

Therefore Abstain could be added as an option to governance topic only, as those proposals don't result in on chain actions and are essentially all temperature checks.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-11-08 19:00:56 UTC | #18

As it seems we are mindlessly voting yes or no then a abstain would be a great way to see if this is the case when no rewards are given and a proposal is rejected if it out ways the yes and no.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-11-08 19:43:08 UTC | #19

With a weighting of 0 "Abstain" is just not voting.  I guess the liquid democracy stuff might mess this up.  The 'change my vote after my neuron vote' would need to include a 'accept,reject, remove vote'.

Omaxus | 2022-11-08 20:48:17 UTC | #20

@justmythoughts 
Abstain vote is paid with some risk. I agree with @Manu to üíØ percent. Abstain is redundant, because the same result is accomplished by not voting at all. The worst thing is it increase the ambitions to not vote at all but getting all benefits from not doing it (active participating in voting)
- creates no deman to follow neurons
- contra productive to create bigger org who respresent the interest of a large group
- etc.

I think this is a lot of work and will require intentionally paying people to perform these activities.

A rebuttal to @Manu @dfxjesse, @wpb, and those who disagree with this feature or who are worried that an increase in abstaining votes could result in the passage of proposals which otherwise would not have passed.

By staking, or locking up your ICP in a neuron in the NNS for a set amount of time (8 years), you are forfeiting the right to liquidity or computational utility of that ICP in exchange for voting power and staking rewards proportional to the amount of ICP and time that ICP has been locked up.

A significant portion of this staked ICP and voting power (I would estimate >20-25%) selects a followee neuron and does not log back in. While their vote is counting towards a YES or NO vote through the followee, they have ‚Äúchecked-out‚Äù, and are not actively voting. This is not any better for decentralization of the network or the decisions made through governance, as it simply pads the overall voting power of various named neurons and does not accurately represent the **true** active voting power of voters that think upon and manually vote or stay up to date with their followees‚Äô positions on each and every proposal.

We already have an ‚Äúalways rejects‚Äù named neuron, and I assume we‚Äôll end up with an ‚Äúalways approves‚Äù named neuron in the future, as well as scripts that one can use to auto-vote on every proposal. Passive participation in the NNS is a intentional feature not a flaw, so why would should the choice to actively abstain be any different?

I would therefore argue that passively following a neuron that votes YES or NO is no different than an individual neuron actively voting to ABSTAIN.

Additionally, allowing voters the ability to actively abstain removes the current financial incentives and ties that **requires voters to have an opinion on every issue**. Most voters, including myself don‚Äôt have a well formed opinion on every single issue (even though I‚Äôve read though these forums every day for the past 10 months) nor do we have the time to do so, and we can‚Äôt expect voters to be experts on who the best experts/neurons are to follow in each governance topic. 

Using financial rewards as a mechanism to force voters to pick a side or a followee neuron doesn‚Äôt help the NNS make decisions or make the NNS any safer, as the only people fully understanding most proposals are the ones who have had the time to fully read through and understand each and every proposal.

Voters shouldn‚Äôt be forced into either rushing their voting decision or blindly trusting a followee neuron to make the ‚Äúright decision‚Äù. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to abstain if they don‚Äôt feel that their vote will add anything positive to the outcome. In this sense, the choice to abstain without financial losses is crucial.

For those arguing about rewards, the real ‚Äúrewards‚Äù that a voter misses out on by actively abstaining is that their voting power will not produce any impact on governance. The passive, abstaining investor will receive their voting rewards, but has now placed their funds and 100% faith in the community to make the best decisions on their behalf. This is a much larger risk to the abstaining neuron, given that during this time **their vote will not count**.

Personally speaking...

I have nothing intelligent to add yet as my opinion has not really been baked.

I will say that I generally have liked the idea of an abstain, but I admit I have not really gone through the intellectual exercise of seeing how it can affect many parts of the system or even basic game theory.

What I will say which is more useful, is that I know folks in DFINITY are actively reading this thread.

**I also think this is the IDEAL thing for the Governance Working Group to discuss.... a mechanism about voting.**

I think these are very different actions.  All proposals need a yes/no decision.  Delegating your vote to a Followee is active participation in that decision making process.  Over time, as we get more named neurons, and the quality and participation levels of those named neurons improves, decentralization will improve.  This will lead to more options on who deserves to be the recipient of your delegated vote.  Abstain is removing yourself from the yes/no decision making process.  This should not be rewarded because you are not participating in that decision.

I added [additional thoughts on this topic on Taggr](https://taggr.top/#/post/10005) earlier today.  There are several interesting comments from other well known community members in that blog post as well.

I‚Äôm actually more inclined to favor changing Governance weight to 0 over adding an Abstain button.  However, I hesitate to make that change too.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-11-09 04:13:23 UTC | #26

I agree with most of what you are saying as it is my personal experience that at first I had no idea or understood voting but after a time I found following a useful  tool for a selfish reason of rewards, now I have a growing knowledge of certain groups that I vote on as I have learnt that I can refresh https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance to know when to login to vote as I have twice this morning.

Still I was not sure on Bless New SNS Deployment and voted no because of the unprofessional naming.

I would support a third option as there are times where I feel I have more to say than YES or NO.

As I understand it there should be a post about an vote on the NNS and the reasons with a better time frame than I have just posted this proposal on the NNS for voting.

As a voter i am very familiar with this challenge, but I still think this challenge is also solved if we all just get comfortable voting no whenever we're not clearly in favor. The NNS has the power to change essentially anything in the IC, so we should be extremely careful here, and I think it should naturally lean towards "no", and I feel like adding an explicit abstain might make it more easy for bad proposals to pass, which could cause huge problems.

Not everyone wants to follow a named neuron, especially until we can recast a vote before the voting period ends. 

Even then since governance proposals are meant to analyze the community's consensus on a certain topic/idea it's better to distinguish between "I don't like this" and "I don't know/care".

`I agree with @wpb here, this would be addressed by periodic confirmation.`

Are you also going to make it transparent on the NNS that following rules have changed and a link to this forum for discussion about why.

I keep seeing that we as voters are mindless and our voting is questionable but even though I may not understand all things I believe most of us know the difference between team updates and spam.

I know when I see spam most of the time and want a third choice to punish them back because at the moment the extra rewards for those who spam cost us all. 

How about taking their rights away from their rewards periodically like want you want to do to the good neurons.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-11-10 17:22:41 UTC | #31

The main benefit I can think of in having an abstain option, is that it would allow me to follow other neurons on all topics, but still choose not to vote on a topic I feel conflicted about, or may want to refrain from participating in (for example, due to conflict of interest). Today if I want to not vote, I have to unfollow neurons until after the vote is passed.

Abstain is different from not voting at all. 
If one doesn't vote at all it probably means he is not actively involved in the NNS. 

Abstain is a perfectly valid choice if a staker wants to receive rewards while not expressing 
himself on a topic he has no strong opinion on. Forcing stakers to vote yes/no all the times if they want to receive maturity will just have them vote randomly or by hearsay, making the outcome of the vote less accurate of the community's actual consensus.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-11-11 18:05:08 UTC | #35

People do not vote randomly.  They vote with their own financial interests and what they believe is best for the IC.  In aggregate across the entire voting power of the NNS, this results in the long term best interest of the IC.  Not having an abstain button causes people to choose one or more Followee.  When a Followee doesn‚Äôt represent their own best interest, then they become motivated to vote manually or to change their Followee selection.  Either way, it‚Äôs not random.  Every neuron owner is making their own choice how to manage their voting power in their own self interest.

Abstaining is a perfectly valid choice that neuron owners can make for themselves, but that choice does not perform the act of governance of the IC.  Every proposal must be decided yes or no and only yes or no votes contribute to that decision.  We cannot pay people to sit on the sidelines.  We must pay people for governance decisions.  If we pay people who do not contribute to the governance of the IC, then they are profiting solely from the efforts of others.  This would turn ICP into a security and would introduce really big legal problems.

I have no problem with people abstaining from voting on a proposal, but I don‚Äôt think that decision should result in governance rewards.  The utility in an abstain button would be for named neurons to announce that they don‚Äôt plan to vote so their followees know to vote manually.  In fact, there could also be utility related to how the NNS interprets absolute democracy and on an individual neuron level.  For example, if a neuron owner has 4 Followees configured and 1 chooses to abstain, then the yes/no vote criteria for that neuron to reach a decision could automatically degrade to 3 neurons instead of 4 neurons for that proposal.  This could be an automated mechanism that enables fair liquid democracy when Followee neurons choose to abstain.

I don't want to get too far off topic here, but people are profiting from the efforts of others - that's sort of how investments work in general. Investors are receiving 10-20% APR for choosing a followee and checking out. I have no problem with this, but let's not pretend that the NNS voters are the ones that will be responsible for the success of the IC (if it succeeds).

The real builders on the IC (DFINITY, dev community) are the ones who are providing the effort and value (potential, yet to be realized).

The entire staked maturity conversion/maturity modulation change was made to prevent tax events from occurring - for all intensive purposes ICP was a security before the change, and after the change it becomes more difficult to classify it as one.

Governance proposals don't need a yes or no outcome as they don't result in any immediate actions and are merely polls to determine community consensus, "abstain" is a valid outcome in such scenarios and shouldn't be penalized with maturity loss otherwise nobody would use it. Some governance proposals imo should have high abstain rate as they might be too technical or interest only a subset of the entire NNS community, e.g ICRC-1. In such cases the average voter is unlikely to have an informed opinion so with the current system they have to either vote randomly/based on hearsay or rely on a named neuron, but that shouldn't be required, infact I think it's an antipattern that only reduces the level of decentralization and accuracy of governance proposals. 

Wouldn't it be more transparent if the yes/no votes on those proposals came only from those willing to express their own informed opinion instead of those who happen to have many followers?

I'd argue abstaining from proposals is a governance decision and contributes more to the IC governance than an uninformed vote or following a named neuron just to get maturity on autopilot.

Choosing a Followee is active participation in governance because the vote is counted and it is cast by someone you trust to cast it for you.  It‚Äôs an actual contribution to governance decisions even if it is low effort.  I don‚Äôt think that decision should go on indefinitely, which is why I co-sponsored the periodic confirmation of neuron followees proposal with @Kyle_Langham over 6 months ago.  It‚Äôs still an easy way to make active decisions, but at least it forces all neuron owners to stop and think about who they are following and confirm that is still who they want to follow.

I‚Äôm not sure how to respond to the rest.  My commentary was not about who or what will make the IC successful.  I agree developers are important.  The profit I was talking about is the payments made by the NNS through tokenomics to perform the work of governance.

I think your two arguments would be the outcome of the idea presented by @skilesare to change the proposal weight of Governance topics to 0.  That way there is no driver to select a Followee for the Governance topic and the only people who vote are the people who really care about that specific non-binding proposal.  I recognize that the NNS could function this way and would be in keeping with the tokenomics design to incentivize governance participation.  It would push all NNS decisions that are paid by tokenomics to apply to only proposals that affect the code and it would eliminate the need to vote on Governance proposals in order to maximize voting rewards.  I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm in favor of this idea (I‚Äôm actually neutral about it at this time), but it would achieve your desired outcome of the Abstain button (not voting, yet maximizing rewards) without having to pay people for abstaining on NNS decisions.
