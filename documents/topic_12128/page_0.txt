ICP is wonderful with update calls being replicated across distributed canister nodes using consensus and finalised in just secs.

Is there is any URI scheme defined for ICP. It can enable users to easily make payments by simply clicking links on webpages or scanning QR Codes. 

**Below are URI schemes improvement proposals for BTC and ADA**

Here is Bitcoin - BIP 21 [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021)

I've wanted this on the NNS for a while. I should be able to do https://nns.ic0.app/?mode=payment&to=account1&amount=00000&memo=4 and have the nns validate me and preload the payment screen where all I have to do is select the account I want the payment to go out of.

icp:// uri is not taken yet. Can you/somebody from ICP send an email and register URI schema for **icp://** ? Then, we can catch URI schemas link from browser extensions and mobile apps
