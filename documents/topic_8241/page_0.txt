Hi.
I need to calculate the cost of storing cans. I am preparing a demo version and it is desirable to make a long canister (without denial of service) Several parameters affect the freezing time: memory allocation; allocation of calculations; freezing threshold. Is there an approximate (~) calculation formula? Can they tell me the commands in dfx?
