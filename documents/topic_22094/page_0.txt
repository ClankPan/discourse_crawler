The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposal today.

# This Release

Fix `OpenSnsTokenSwap` uniqueness enforcement and re-enable this proposal type in NNS governance. These were [previously temporary disabled](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-update-august-7-2023/21992) to prevent the possibility that multiple proposals of this type can be opened simultaneously.

Additionally, this release contains a (potentially breaking) change in the NNS Governance metrics.
