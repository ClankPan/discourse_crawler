Hello, everyone, I'm Faye. Editor of [Week in Internet Computer (DFINITY) News](https://weekinicp.substack.com/) [@Week_ICP](https://twitter.com/Week_ICP). I started closely following the crypto industry in 2020 and unintentionally joined a crypto startup. A few months later, I was introduced to ICP, and I have to say that the ICP future described by the presenter is really attractive. Then, I attempted to join IC community in order to continue learning, and I eventually did so by working for a IC community. However, something unexpected happened, the macro changes had an impact on the team operation.

However, I still have a passion for continuous study for the industry and specially IC. As non-tech guy,  I will dedicate myself in content outputs. So, I started ["Week in Internet Computer (DFINITY) News"](https://weekinicp.substack.com/) in Jun in purpose of gathering spotlight moments in IC community weekly.  Hope IC lovers all around the world would be able to get IC related activities in one mail and know where we are. Of course, through the progress tracking, as community member, we also want get more time exact updates from the development team regarding milestone updates. 

Specially Thanks to the expertise of all the community experts, you are the source of the report!
I am able to gather information and viewpoints from you all and I aspire for everyone's viewpoints to be shared with a large audience.

Extend a sincere appreciation to every single community member!

In the near future, I will start writing more IC related contents, and hope to interact and learn from each other!

My Substack is now unavailable. Those of you who signed up this week will not receive emails. Substack notified me on Saturday that my site had been suspended, which surprised me! I'm still in contact with them about the specific cause.
