In a past [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/canister-history-on-the-ic/21745), we announced that the IC tracks the history of deployed canister code hashes and controller changes (referred to as the canister history).

As it turned out, there was a bug in the implementation of the canister history feature and entries for some canister code changes might be missing. In more detail, if a canister code installation was executed over multiple rounds using deterministic time slicing (a.k.a. DTS - more information on DTS can be found [here](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/execution-layer/)), then the corresponding code change entry is missing in the history. The bug has been fixed by this replica [commit](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/d2679ab112ee7682b9e3c8836d3a9d38e88c047e) and approved and released by the NNS DAO in proposal [126293](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126293).

Hence, the canister history is only guaranteed to contain entries for all canister changes made after the proposal has been rolled out on the canisterâ€™s subnet (since December 11, 2023, 10:47:33 AM UTC, on all subnets). For canister changes made beforehand, the corresponding entries might be missing, but, if present, they are genuine.
