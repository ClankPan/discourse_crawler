I have set my identity and transferred ICP from coinbase to the nns app, that's alright.

From there, what should I do to be able to deploy an app (assets + wasm) to the IC:

- Should I create two canisters and add cycles in nss?
- Or should I link the local canisters ids, instead of creating these, in nss?
- Once the above steps performed, what commands should be use to add the wallet to my local project so that I can deploy?
- My local principal id is not the one displayed in nss, that's expected right (if I get the doc on that point)?

Totally noob questions but I am kind of lost. I would appreciate any help.

Better to create your wallet in DFX and then send ICP there

Right now this post details my recommended "first canister" deployment approach, and doesn't involve the cycles wallet

That was what I looking for üëç

If I may, I got both assets and wasm in my `canister_ids.json`

```
{
  "assets": {
    "local": "rrkah-...."
  },
  "counter": {
    "local": "ryjl3-..."
  }
}
```

I guess I should then create two canisters in nns and add both `ic` afterwards right? something like

```
{
  "assets": {
    "local": "rrkah-....",
    "ic": "...." // <--------- canister 1 from nns
  },
  "counter": {
    "local": "ryjl3-...",
    "ic": "...." // <--------- canister 2 from nns
  }
}
```

right?

Yep, that should do it

Thanks! I faced another error because I was trying to edit the `canister_ids.json` in `.dfx/...`, the one created locally, and got a `404 Not Found` when I tried to deploy to the network. I finally figured out I had to create a `canister_ids.json` at the **root** of the project which look like:

```
{
  "assets": {
    "ic": "...." // <--------- canister 1 for static assets, my www, id from nns 
  },
  "counter": {
    "ic": "...." // <--------- canister 2 for wasm, id from nns
  }
}
```

The deployment is running, let see if it goes through ü§û.

Thanks for the support üôè.
