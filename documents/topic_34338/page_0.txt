## ELNA's Strategic Focus: Strengthening Foundations and Accelerating Growth

As ELNA continues to lead as the world's first AI DAO, we are proud of the significant progress we've made in the past quarters. We are now poised to focus on visibility, legal strengthening, monetization, and revenue generation as we move into the final quarter of 2024. To support these initiatives, we request 40K ICP from the SNS Treasury, trusting that our community will support this proposal from the ELNA Dev team.

### Key Achievements from the Last Quarters

1. **Community Engagement and Traction**:
ELNA successfully engaged the community through a series of physical and online hackathons and events, that have helped skill up and grow the number of developers building AI on blockchain, while also educating them on the Internet Computer, fostering a vibrant dev ecosystem around our platform.

2. **Launch of ELNA Developer Marketplace**:
We proudly launched the ELNA Developer Marketplace, onboarding over 50 developers to accelerate AI innovation on the IC blockchain.

3. **Inception of ELNA Community Grant**:
To further encourage AI development on the IC blockchain, we initiated the ELNA Community Grant, empowering developers with the resources needed to bring their projects to life.

4. **Advanced Vector Database Release**:
We released our advanced vector database, a critical component in enhancing our AI capabilities and infrastructure, through indexing and storing vector embeddings for fast retrieval and similarity search of data.

5. **Progress on Fully On-chain Embedding Model**:
We made significant strides in developing a fully on-chain embedding model, bringing us closer to realizing our vision of decentralized AI.

6. **Team Expansion**:
ELNA expanded its team to 10 full-time members, ensuring that we have the talent and capacity to drive our ambitious growth plans forward.

### Strategic Focus Areas for Q4 2024

1. **Visibility and Brand Awareness**:
We will launch targeted marketing campaigns and strategic PR efforts to increase ELNA’s visibility, attract new users, and establish ourselves as a leader in the AI and blockchain space.

2. **Legal Strengthening**:
As regulatory landscapes continue to evolve, we will engage legal experts to ensure robust compliance frameworks around intellectual property, data privacy, and corporate governance.

3. **Monetization and Revenue Generation**:
Our focus will shift towards identifying and activating revenue streams, including the introduction of billing and sales mechanisms within the ELNA platform.

4. **Community and Ecosystem Development**:
We will continue to build our community through events, workshops, hackathons, and engagement activities, growing the developer ecosystem, encouraging active participation in ELNA’s expansion.

### Request for Support

With these objectives in mind, ELNA's roadmap for Q4 2024 is designed to solidify our foundations and accelerate our growth trajectory. We kindly request the community’s support for this funding proposal as we work towards achieving our strategic goals.
