Bitomni | 2024-08-06 06:23:38 UTC | #1

Greetings, IC community!

The Bitomni team is deeply grateful for your exceptional support and guidance. As we approach the launch of our SNS DAO, we are thrilled to share that Bitomni is gearing up for a significant phase in our journey. This advancement will set the stage for initiating decentralized swaps, aligning with our strategic milestones.

We invite you to delve into the critical elements of our journey thus far and share in anticipation of what lies ahead.

## What is Bitomni?

Bitomni is a BTCFi-driven omnichain asset management protocol. It transforms crypto asset management by integrating Bitcoin and its emerging assets with omnichain capabilities, ensuring decentralized, trustless, secure, and diversified BTCFi solutions on multiple blockchains. At its core, Bitomni leverages the Internet Computer's technology for its protocol's critical functionalities and offers built-in BTCFi DApps, including BitoBridge (a Bitcoin omnichain bridge), BitoRestaking (a Bitcoin restaking service), BitoIndexer (a decentralized Bitcoin meta-protocol indexer), BitoBank (Bitcoin lending and borrowing), and BitoFund (on-chain fund management of Bitcoin and its assets), across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM-compatible chains, Bitcoin Layer2s, Solana, Aptos, Polkadot, and more. By harnessing the power of interoperability, Bitomni unlocks the full potential of the Bitcoin ecosystem, enabling users to refine their asset management strategies in a secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment.

## Evolution of Bitomni

The Bitomni, rooted in the CBIndex project, was initiated by CB Labs in 2022. Bitomni’s initial venture into the Web3 space focused on on-chain fund solutions, aiming to revolutionize crypto asset management. By leveraging IC’s advanced technologies and the proven maturity and diversity of active and index funds from the traditional financial market, Bitomni seeks to bring transformative change to the sector. Initially, the project served a broad spectrum of on-chain financial functions, offering various tools for effective asset management through active and index funds on the blockchain. This early stage featured the development of the Simulator App, which was equipped with advanced on-chain fund management capabilities. Designed to streamline and secure the management of crypto assets, the Simulator allowed users to experiment with features in a risk-free simulated environment, ensuring they did not jeopardize their actual assets.

However, as the Web3 space evolved, so did Bitomni’s strategic focus. Recognizing the untapped potential of Bitcoin within the DeFi landscape and IC's unique advantage, Bitomni pivoted to a BTCFi-driven approach. This shift was driven by the growing demand for integrated financial services that could bridge the gap between traditional Bitcoin functionalities and the broader DeFi ecosystem. By redirecting its expertise towards BTCFi, Bitomni began developing a protocol and a suite of products designed to harness Bitcoin’s security and liquidity, thus broadening its use cases beyond mere a store of value. This strategic pivot aligned Bitomni with the latest trends in the Web3 space and positioned it as a leader in the burgeoning field of BTCFi, set to transform how Bitcoin and its emerging assets are utilized in DeFi.

## BitoBridge: the first BTCFi DApp governed by Bitomni DAO

BitoBridge will be the first BTCFi DApp governed by the Bitomni DAO. BitoBridge is a trust-minimized, decentralized, two-way pegged Bitcoin omnichain bridge designed to enhance Bitcoin and its tokens' utilities by integrating them into diverse DeFi ecosystems. BitoBridge serves as a cornerstone in Bitomni’s suite of built-in BTCFi DApps, facilitating the seamless movement of Bitcoin and its emerging tokens across various blockchains. The governance of BitoBridge involves the Bitomni DAO, where BITO token holders democratically manage protocol changes and upgrades. This ensures transparency and community involvement, allowing users to actively influence the development and future direction of BitoBridge within the expanding BTCFi landscape.

## Other BTCFi DApps that Bitomni DAO will govern

Upon establishing the Bitomni DAO, this decentralized autonomous organization will oversee the development and deployment of various BTCFi DApps, such as BitoRestaking, BitoIndexer, BitoBank, and BitoFund:

**BitoRestaking** represents a novel approach to enhancing Bitcoin's utility and yield-generating potential within the DeFi ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from concepts similar to those pioneered by EigenLayer and Babylon, this innovative mechanism allows Bitcoin holders to participate in securing various Proof of Stake (PoS) networks. By restaking their Bitcoin, users can earn additional rewards while contributing to the security and stability of PoS networks. This process increases the earning potential of Bitcoin holders and integrates Bitcoin more deeply into the broader DeFi landscape.

**BitoIndexer** is a decentralized Bitcoin meta-protocol indexer built on IC that allows for trustless indexing and querying of data from the Bitcoin blockchain and parsing for various Bitcoin meta-protocols without relying on centralized services.

**BitoBank** is a Bitcoin lending and borrowing DApp that enables Bitcoin holders to lend their assets in exchange for interest payments, providing a passive income stream that wasn't possible. Conversely, borrowers can access Bitcoin loans by putting up collateral, often in the form of other cryptocurrencies, which unlocks the liquidity of their holdings without the need to sell.

**BitoFund** incorporates omnichain funds into our suite of BTCFi products. These active and index funds, operating entirely on IC and other blockchains, provide transparent, secure, and efficient means for collective investment strategies, directly tapping into the liquidity and innovative potential of Bitcoin tokens and crypto assets.

The DAO will be able to modify these plans by submitting and approving proposals, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in response to the community's needs and evolving market conditions.

## Proposed Token Allocation

The Service Nervous System (SNS) will be initialized with 1 billion BITO tokens allocated in the following proportions.

![image|690x414](upload://c4WPbXNFJAcsTYjCrqx5NvPav3E.png)

**SNS Swap**: Allocating 12% of the total BITO token supply for public sale will support Bitomni's decentralized governance and fundraising for its SNS. Upon completion of the sale, each participant will be allocated their BITO tokens in the form of five neurons with dissolve delays set at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively.

**Developer Team**: The founding developer team will be allocated 10% of the total BITO token supply, distributed equally across five neurons with a one-month dissolve delay and vesting periods of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively. This will provide a structured release of tokens to the founding developer team over time, ensuring a gradual and balanced contribution to the ecosystem's stability and growth.

**Airdrop**: To foster early community engagement and interaction, 1.0% of the total BITO token supply will be dedicated to an airdrop prior to the official launch of the Bitomni SNS. This airdrop aims to recognize and reward the community's active participants. The airdrop is scheduled to occur following the successful establishment of the Bitomni SNS, ensuring that the foundation of our governance structure is solid before rewarding community engagement. This part of the BITO token has a one-month dissolve delay.

**SNS Treasury**: Following the decentralization sale, the Bitomni SNS will control a treasury comprising 77% of the total BITO tokens. This substantial reserve will primarily be utilized to incentivize community engagement and growth through user rewards. Contributors who positively impact Bitomni’s development will receive rewards from this pool. Additionally, the treasury will fund community bounties through SNS proposals, compensating individuals for broader contributions to the Bitomni ecosystem, such as third-party development, code contributions, and bug hunting.

For more details on token allocation, please check out our [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.bitomni.io/service-nervous-system-sns/token-allocation).

## Initial SNS Configuration

The SNS will initially be configured with the settings outlined in the tables below, which can be amended subsequently through proposals.

[sns_init.yaml](https://github.com/CypherBabel-Lab/sns/blob/main/sns_init.yaml)

Amazing working, Bitomni Dapp smooth and easier for new user of IC

-------------------------

tariqmansuri | 2024-08-06 05:30:33 UTC | #4

Good going team 

I have few suggestion like
1) Better to decreased the total supply for better growth of token
2)  burning Mechanism of the token from circulation or treasury

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-06 06:14:52 UTC | #6

Hello, thank you for your feedback! 

Let us understand them correctly:
1. Do you mean something like issuing 100 Million instead of 1 Billion tokens?
2. Yes, the burning mechanism is crucial. As mentioned in the whitepaper, token burning is exclusively enacted via proposals. Do you suggest to preset a burning mechanism before SNS?

-------------------------

pawanGoud16 | 2024-08-06 07:37:08 UTC | #7

Everything perfect, can't wait for SNS launchpad🔥

-------------------------

tariqmansuri | 2024-08-06 08:34:36 UTC | #8

Thank you for your response

1) To 10 Million or 1 million (The growth you have seen in SNS1 which is currently dragginz)
2) Increased deduction in proposal, every quarter burning of token like binance etc 

This is my proposal for betterment of bitomni because people are more interested in less supply.

-------------------------

Klein001 | 2024-08-06 09:44:38 UTC | #9

I've been following Bitomni for awhile now and this is great to see you guys will be having an SNS. Given the current parameters for the decentralization sale, how do you think the proposed structure will impact market stability and participant engagement? Are there any specific adjustments you would recommend based on recent market trends or community feedback?

-------------------------

Atobatele | 2024-08-06 09:54:55 UTC | #10

This is very interesting 🤔 
Good success ahead

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-06 12:04:54 UTC | #11

Thank you for your reply.

1. This is an interesting proposal. However, our research shows that approximately 48.9% of SNS projects have issued close to or over 1 billion tokens. There is no clear evidence that a lower total supply improves project perception. We believe the appropriate supply depends on the nature of the project.
2. The proposal is ideally suited to be presented by the SNS.

Thank you for your insights!

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-06 12:14:21 UTC | #12

Thank you for your support!

By distributing 12% of BITO tokens with staggered dissolve delays, we aim to integrate tokens steadily into the market and prevent immediate sell-offs. The 10% allocation to our developer team, with vesting periods of up to four years, ensures their long-term commitment to the project. The 1% airdrop is designed to foster early engagement and loyalty, while the 77% SNS treasury supports community rewards and ecosystem growth.

We believe it is crucial to maintain flexibility to adjust parameters based on market conditions and community feedback. We'll provide regular updates and transparent communication to build trust, and we’re keen on having a dedicated feedback system to ensure our decisions align with participant needs.

We think this structure is designed to ensure stability and engagement while adapting to market trends and community needs. We're excited to hear more from our community and work together towards our shared goals.

-------------------------

tariqmansuri | 2024-08-06 12:55:09 UTC | #13

Good perception and long term commitment of developers

Ashiq | 2024-08-06 15:20:50 UTC | #14

Can you provide more details about the community incentive programs and how they will engage users in the Bitomni ecosystem? 
Additionally, could you elaborate on the specific roles and benefits for community members within the Bitomni DAO governance model? 
Thank you!

JamesThompson | 2024-08-06 15:21:05 UTC | #15

Fantastic! We're hopeful that the Bitcoin omnichain bridge can truly enhance the IC ecosystem. Bridging the IC community with other ecosystems would be a significant step forward. It's something we definitely need. :slightly_smiling_face:

-------------------------

investorcaleb | 2024-08-06 17:26:56 UTC | #16

first off this project already has a good thing going...it's collaboration and aim is already ground breaking. now all that remains is to continue like this or better than this. Currently i see no flaw in the projects Token allocation. from both the airdrop and dev team allocation and the vesting strategy for both  they gave no room for unexpected dump helping the development of the of the token price wise and also attract outside investors provided there is no unexpected dumping while our tokens are vested.

on speculative bases, the allocation to community, if the community grows larger will the airdop allocation increase?

personally i feel that total transparency in carrying out all that was drafted out will be the main focus for to be achieved especially with the SNS Swap, SNS Treasury  amd the Airdrop allocation. all of  these ultimately reflect what team is building and the strategy to which they want use to carry it out

Lorimer | 2024-08-06 18:07:37 UTC | #17

Many of the users that are praising this project have only very recently joined this forum, with little to no activity other than praising this project. I can't help but find this very suspicious.

Additionally, there's no mention of the neuron fund on this thread, how it will be used, and why it's being requested as party of this SNS. Could you please provide some clarity?

Could you also please sum up why you think this project is needed on the IC? What is not possible on the IC today that will be made possible by this project? Please be as succinct as possible. Thanks you.

Limestonecowboy | 2024-08-06 18:50:17 UTC | #19

The Bitomni team has proven its commitment to the ICP community by, not only using ICP tech, but by reaching-out and connecting with community members and partnering with multiple other projects to get acquainted and feedback for improvements. 
It is vital for any blockchain to be able to connect and move $BTC across multiple chains with ease...and Bitomni appears to be able to deliver with a range of functions to do just so 😀

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-07 03:21:06 UTC | #20

Thank you for your feedback!

Regarding the community incentive programs within the Bitomni ecosystem, we implement these in two phases:

1. **Pre-SNS**: This phase includes various marketing campaigns and the BitoBridge Testnet Engagement, conducted both independently and with partners from different ecosystems. The incentives consist of NFTs or points that lead to token airdrops, actively engaging the community in early testing and feedback.

2. **Post-SNS**: Post-SNS, the incentive program expands to encompass both ongoing marketing efforts and direct interactions with DApps. BITO tokens from the Treasury are earmarked to reward these activities, with specific programs subject to proposal and approval by the community through the SNS.

In terms of governance, the Bitomni DAO operates through a proposal-based system where any community member can submit proposals. BITO neuron holders, who vote on these proposals, see their voting power influenced by the ‘dissolve delay’ of their neurons; longer delays enhance voting power, incentivizing long-term alignment with Bitomni’s strategic objectives. Voting rewards, proportional to each neuron’s voting power compared to the total voting power each day, are distributed daily and can be reinvested for greater influence or disbursed as maturity. This structure not only facilitates effective governance but also fosters a deeply engaged community, ensuring that Bitomni evolves in a way that reflects the collective will and best interests of its stakeholders.

Thank you!

Thank you for your observations and questions. 

Bitomni leverages ICP technology to bridge various blockchain ecosystems, which explains our promotional strategies targeting users from diverse platforms. This approach naturally brings new members to the IC community.

The neuron fund is an integral part of our Treasury, detailed in the SNS treasury section of our whitepaper. The fund is utilized for user rewards, liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBP), fundraising, marketing, centralized exchange listings, airdrops, third-party services, operational costs, and development. All expenditures require approval by the SNS DAO, ensuring transparency and community governance.

Bitomni introduces unique functionalities to the IC, like the BitoBridge—the first Bitcoin omnichain bridge on the IC, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and interoperability within the ICP ecosystem. Our goal is to provide value through innovative DApps and the ultimate market and community feedback will determine our project’s necessity. We are committed to refining our offerings based on this community input to achieve product-market fit. 

Thank you for your engagement and critical insights.

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-07 03:47:53 UTC | #23

I don't feel like this answers the question of what this project brings to the IC. It seems like you're asking for neuron fund participation without clear reasoning regarding why your project is needed.

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-07 08:55:14 UTC | #26

> How much is being requested? Please make this information visible on this forum topic, rather than requiring users to dig through documents.

Our understanding of the Neurons’ Fund Commitment is that it’s based on direct participation rather than a predefined request amount. Consequently, you won’t find a specified ‘requested amount’ in this article or any of our other documentation. We aim for a transparent approach that doesn’t require users to search for such details. Please correct us if our understanding differs from the norm.

> How does this relate to ckBTC, and the various chain fusion twins that are growing on the IC all the time?

BitoBridge utilizes Chain Fusion technology and ckBTC to bridge BTC to various blockchains like Ethereum, differentiating itself from ckBTC, which specifically serves as Bitcoin’s twin within the ICP ecosystem. Additionally, BitoBridge facilitates the bridging of ICRC tokens to other blockchains. In essence, while we employ Chain-key twins as tools, our core function extends beyond merely leveraging these twins.

> I don’t feel like this answers the question of what this project brings to the IC. It seems like you’re asking for neuron fund participation without clear reasoning regarding why your project is needed.

We can list several reasons why Bitomni is needed in the IC ecosystem:
1) Bitomni focuses on BTCFi, a combination of Bitcoin and DeFi, which aligns with IC's strategic priorities. We stand poised to contribute significantly to this area.
2) We have successfully implemented Chain Fusion technology and designed/developed specialized DApps like BitoBridge, BitoIndexer, and BitoRestaking, addressing specific needs within the IC ecosystem.
3) Our project plays a crucial role in bridging diverse blockchain ecosystems, thereby attracting new users to the IC ecosystem.
While these points underscore our project's relevance, we believe the true measure of our necessity will be the real-world utility and community feedback.

Thank you.

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-07 09:10:30 UTC | #27

Thank you for your insights and support!

Regarding the airdrops, they are structured in two phases:

1. Pre-SNS: We’ve allocated 1% of the BITO tokens for community airdrops, targeting those who participated in our early campaigns before the initiation of SNS. This allocation is fixed and will be configured in the sns_init file.
2. Post-SNS: Future airdrops are planned but not preset in percentage. They will be subject to SNS DAO governance, meaning any allocation must be proposed and approved by the community through voting. 

Although we could specify an amount for clarity, we prefer to avoid any miscommunication since DAO approval is necessary for implementation. Your point on transparency is well-taken and is central to how we intend to manage community expectations and governance interactions.

Thank you!

-------------------------

ICPINSIDER | 2024-08-07 10:06:17 UTC | #28

Most SNS projects always offers 25% of the token for the swap thereby reducing the potential marketcap of the token and increasing potential profit margin for buyers, why is your team offering just 12%?

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-08 02:47:29 UTC | #30

Thank you for raising this point. It’s crucial to understand our token allocation strategy.

Firstly, the percentage of tokens allocated for SNS sales doesn’t affect the market cap or FDV independently. FDV is influenced by the percentage of tokens sold, the amount of ICP raised, and the prevailing ICP price. Despite allocating only 12% of tokens to the SNS sale, Bitomni’s intended minimum FDV is competitively positioned among 2024 SNS projects, as our research indicates.

![image](upload://pwW3zoGpjiUMHEPf4KqR7HdSv9P)

The decision for a 12% allocation stems primarily from two considerations:

1. **Security against 51% Attacks**: This is the primary reason. Because Bitomni does not have a seed round like most projects listed in the figure above and the percentage allocated to our dev team is low, it is very difficult to mitigate a 51% attack during the SNS sale. If we allocate more tokens for the SNS sale, attackers will have less difficulty. Our simulations show that with the current allocation, even if an attacker secured 80% of the SNS sale tokens, their total voting power would remain below 50%. You can find a detailed analysis on this in our whitepaper under the section on [mitigating 51% attacks](https://whitepaper.bitomni.io/service-nervous-system-sns/sns-treasury#mitigation-against-a-51-attack.).
2. **Sustaining Future Development**:
  * **Venture Capital Involvement**: We’re targeting tier-one CEX listings and believe backing from prestigious VCs is essential. VC rounds typically involve 10-15% of tokens and with a higher FDV than SNS sales, which we consider crucial for both SNS investors and our team.
  * **Continued DApp Development**: Beyond our current BitoBridge, we’ve completed designs for BitoIndexer and BitoRestaking and plan to initiate development post-SNS. Sufficient tokens must be reserved not only for development but also for robust marketing and operational strategies like airdrops and engagement rewards to ensure active user participation and enhance investor value.

We believe this strategic allocation allows us to secure the network while ensuring ample resources for future growth and innovation within the Bitomni ecosystem. However, we are glad you raised the question and are open to discussions and suggestions!

Thank you!

lumiere | 2024-08-08 06:48:14 UTC | #31

Are there any planned partnerships or agreements with CEXs for listing BITO tokens in the near future? If so, can you provide any information on which exchanges are being targeted and the anticipated timelines for these listings?

-------------------------

Bitomni | 2024-08-08 07:10:19 UTC | #32

Thank you for your question. We understand the importance of exchange listings for the liquidity and accessibility of BITO tokens. At this stage, we are actively exploring partnerships and agreements with several CEXs to list BITO tokens.

While we cannot disclose specific exchanges at this moment due to ongoing negotiations and confidentiality agreements, we are targeting reputable and high-volume exchanges to ensure the best possible exposure and trading experience for our users. We aim to finalize these partnerships and have BITO tokens listed within the next few quarters. There is still tons of work to do, including a successful SNS, mainnet launch, and community/user growth.

We will keep the community updated with official announcements as soon as these agreements are confirmed. Thank you for your continued support and interest in Bitomni.

Thank you for your question. Before we answer the question, could you please give some feedback on these points:

If an IC user wants to bring Ghost to Ethereum, which DApp or IC service should the user use?
If an IC user wants to bring BTC from the Bitcoin native blockchain to Ethereum, which DApp or IC service should the user use?
If an IC user wants to bring his/her ERC20 token (e.g., Eth)  to Solana, which DApp or IC service should the user use?

To make sure that I understand correctly, chain fusion tech avoids the need to bridge **to** the IC. Bitomni would like to take the power of chain fusion **from** the IC to other networks, by **bridging** those ck tokens to those other networks?

Isn't that somewhat self-defeating, given that chain fusion is about avoiding bridges?

Thank you for your reply.

Bitomni is a BTCFi-driven omnichain asset management protocol that offers a suite of BTCFi DApps, including BitoBridge, which serves as a foundational infrastructure for other BTCFi DApps. We are also developing a decentralized Bitcoin meta-protocol indexer, another critical infrastructure component.

> chain fusion tech avoids the need to bridge **to** the IC

Yes. Chain Fusion tech can bring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to IC without intermediaries (or bridges). It has done a great job on Bitcoin via protocol-level integration, especially.

> Bitomni would like to take the power of chain fusion **from** the IC to other networks, by **bridging** those ck tokens to those other networks?

No. Bitomni is not here to use Chain Fusion's power to bridge tokens to other networks. As stated on the Chain Fusion webpage: "Chain Fusion enables smart contracts to interact with multiple networks allowing developers to realise multichain use cases and profit from ICP features." Bitomni is aiming to do exactly that with a focus on Bitcoin and its tokens. 

As for BitoBridge, one of the BTCFi DApps of Bitomni, it is here to leverage Chain Fusion technology to provide users with the capabilities of: 
1) Bridging BTC and its emerging tokens, such as BRC20, from Bitcoin native blockchain to other blockchains (the BitoBridge Testnet now supports Ethereum, Arbitrum, and StratoVM). Please note: a. We use ckBTC as an intermediary to achieve this feature; b. Currently, there is basically no DApp to provide this service in the market. 
2) Bridging ICRC standard tokens (ck tokens are only a tiny part of ICRC tokens; for example, Ghost and CHAT are ICRC tokens but not ck tokens) to other blockchains (the BitoBridge Testnet now supports Ethereum, Arbitrum, and StratoVM); Please note: a. Currently, there is basically no DApp to provide this service in the market. b. One of the DFINITY Dev Grants we received includes this as an important feature.
3) Bridging tokens of other standards, e.g., ERC20, to other blockchains, such as Aptos. Please note: there are other protocols, e.g., Layerzero, that can deliver this capability; however, they are not on IC. However, we think this feature reflects Chain Fusion's vision and potentially strengthens IC capability.

> Isn’t that somewhat self-defeating, given that chain fusion is about avoiding bridges?

We do not think Chain Fusion is about avoiding bridges. Chain Fusion is about seamless and secure interoperability between different blockchains. No bridge is needed to bring BTC to IC as ckBTC or ETH as ckETH. However, a Bitcoin omnichain bridge is needed to deliver the capabilities mentioned above. 

In these cases, IC is the "bridge" since BitoBridge is built on IC, and all the core functionalities are realized in canisters. One of the reasons that BitoBridge is supposed to be safer and more trustless than other bridges is because it does not bootstrap a decentralized network like many other bridges do; we use IC, which provides us with the security, decentralization, and trustless once it is governed by an SNS DAO.

We hope this helps clarify things. Thank you.

My concern (which may be unfounded, but I prefer to be vocal and wrong, than silent but on to something) is that if there is a vulnerability in Bitomni bridging solutions (built on the IC), and this is exploited, it'll be a very bad look, particularly if endorsed as an SNS.

- Can I ask what security audits Bitomni's suite of tools have been through?
- How many of these IC-based tools have been built already, and what features are yet to be built?
- Why is Bitomni seeking to decentralise at this stage?

Great job Bitomni, I've been waiting for the day you guys presale SNS from the beginning, I've known about your project since 2 months ago

Preparation for $ICP for SNS presale is complete, let's do it
125000 ICP minimum is too easy to pass, I'm looking forward to Hardcap 1M ICP
Pros:

1. Careful preparation from community opinion care
2. Daily product improvement
3. Partners with StratoVM help Bitcoin L2 community know more about ICP
4. Future products make defi more friendly with ICP
And many other advantages

Thank you for sharing your concerns.

It's true that vulnerabilities can potentially affect any project in the Web3 space, especially in bridging solutions, and such incidents would indeed be damaging. However, it has nothing to do with being 'endorsed as an SNS' as it doesn't guarantee safety or success. The SNS framework is designed to manage projects in a decentralized and democratic way rather than acting as a security guarantee.

At a high level, the likelihood of a project being targeted by hackers is directly related to its perceived value—the more valuable a project becomes, the more attractive it is to hackers. We appreciate that you see Bitomni as a project of significant value, which naturally brings the potential for increased attention from malicious actors.


> * Can I ask what security audits Bitomni’s suite of tools have been through?

Regarding security audits, we haven't conducted one yet because BitoBridge is still in active development. We recently completed the development of BitoBridge V2, which is now undergoing internal testing. After this phase, we will move to public testing with BitoBridge Testnet V2. Once the code is stabilized, we will initiate a thorough security audit, which will be shared with the community before the SNS launch.

> * How many of these IC-based tools have been built already, and what features are yet to be built?

Currently, only BitoBridge has been built, with BitoIndexer and BitoRestaking in the final stages of technical design. BitoBank and BitoFund are still in the planning phase. However, progress on these DApps will ultimately be guided by the SNS DAO once Bitomni transitions to decentralized governance.

> * Why is Bitomni seeking to decentralise at this stage?

As for the SNS sale, it won't happen immediately. As mentioned at the end of this post: **There is considerable work to be completed before launching the SNS. This article serves as a platform for gathering insights, feedback, and suggestions. We greatly value and welcome the community’s contributions and perspectives!**

As for why we want to do an SNS at all, there are three main reasons:
1) To align with our goal of decentralizing and democratizing Bitomni's products and services;
2) To build a strong community that can support Bitomni in the competitive Web3 environment;
3) To raise funds for further development. We have been self-funded for the last two years as a research lab. However, we must raise funds to deliver products, services, marketing activities, and hopefully profits to our users, partners, and investors.

I hope this clarifies your concerns. Thank you for your continued interest in Bitomni.

Thank you for your question and for recognizing the importance of interoperability and decentralized governance in our platform. We fully agree that continuous innovation is crucial in this rapidly evolving space.

Currently, BitoBridge is our primary DApp and serves as a cornerstone of our BTCFi-driven omnichain asset management protocol. BitoBridge facilitates the seamless movement of Bitcoin and its emerging tokens across various blockchains, which not only enhances Bitcoin’s utility within the broader DeFi ecosystem but also significantly contributes to the IC community by showcasing the IC’s powerful capabilities in enabling cross-chain interoperability and secure asset management.

**Future Developments**

1. BitoIndexer: In the near future, we plan to launch BitoIndexer, a decentralized Bitcoin meta-protocol indexer. This tool will allow for trustless indexing and querying of data from the Bitcoin blockchain and deliver meta-protocol data to users, enabling more efficient and reliable access to Bitcoin’s vast data landscape. This aligns with our goal of building a more transparent and accessible Bitcoin ecosystem while enriching the IC community by integrating more Bitcoin data and functionality into the IC network.

2. BitoRestaking: Another exciting development on our roadmap is BitoRestaking. This DApp will enable Bitcoin holders to participate in securing various PoS networks, effectively expanding Bitcoin’s role in the DeFi space beyond a store of value. By restaking their Bitcoin, users can earn additional rewards while contributing to the security of these networks. This increases the utility of Bitcoin and enhances the IC ecosystem by bringing more assets and users to the platform, further solidifying IC’s position as a major blockchain for decentralized finance.

3. BitoBank and BitoFund: Looking further ahead, we are also planning BitoBank, a DApp focused on Bitcoin lending and borrowing, and BitoFund, which will offer on-chain fund management solutions. These future products will provide new ways for users to leverage their Bitcoin assets and manage diverse portfolios across multiple blockchains, broadening the scope of BTCFi. These developments will also drive greater adoption and usage of the IC, as more users will interact with its network to access these advanced financial services.

**Alignment with Long-Term Vision**

These developments align with Bitomni’s long-term vision of creating a robust, decentralized, and interoperable BTCFi ecosystem. By expanding our product offerings beyond BitoBridge, we aim to provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools that enhance the utility, security, and accessibility of Bitcoin within the DeFi landscape. Moreover, each of these innovations strengthens the IC community by driving adoption, increasing transaction volume, and showcasing the IC’s potential as a hub for cutting-edge blockchain solutions.

As we continue to build and innovate, our focus will remain on fostering a strong, decentralized community through the SNS DAO, ensuring that our platform evolves in response to the needs and feedback of our users. We are excited about the future and look forward to sharing more about these developments as they progress.

Thank you for your continued interest and support in Bitomni.
