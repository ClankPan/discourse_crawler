Here are some strategies you might find useful:

1.As mentioned earlier, setting the slippage to 0 can help prevent losses from sandwich attacks by bots. A successful 0-slippage transaction will secure your expected trading price.

2.The ICPSwap team started identifying and operating counter bots to lure sandwich attack bots some time ago, However, this approach can only address some of the bots, as they can switch wallet addresses and continue operating, or hide for some time first.

3.The team will soon develop and launch a pre-transfer feature. This will allow users to transfer funds in advance to their sub-account (Reclaim account) within the pool. Users can view or withdraw funds to their wallets at any time. When users make a trade, the swap will prioritize using the balance from their Reclaim account. Users can transfer funds to their Reclaim account in advance and choose to make trades at any time afterward, which can help avoid sandwich attacks by bots
