What access ways do we have,
 and any practical examples ?

Guess i have to do it myself by look into the ic source code

Until we get that in dfx I think the easiest way is via Motoko where you can do it like this:

```motoko
  type Management = actor {
    install_code : ({
      mode : {
        #install;
        #reinstall;
        #upgrade : { skip_pre_upgrade : Bool };
      };
      canister_id : Principal;
      wasm_module : Blob;
      arg : Blob;
    }) -> async ();
  };

  public func doStuff() : async Nat {
    let IC0 : Management = actor ("aaaaa-aa");
    let a = await IC0.install_code(...);
    ...
  };


  
```

I will try motoko immediately . I never think there is a motoko way. thanks!

Oh and to get a wasm into your canister my preferred way is to use [`ic-repl`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-repl) where you can call functions with `file("custom.wasm")` which makes it send the file as a blob so you don't have to deal with converting to blob encoding yourself
