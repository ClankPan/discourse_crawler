According to [this comment on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/o4zdy6/we_are_david_johan_nicolas_and_ryan_ask_us/h2n01x0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3):

> You actually need a simple majority YES vote from ALL eligible neurons. As at today, if Dfinity Foundation & ICA don't vote, you can't get that, since most neurons follow them.

If this is the case, I think it would make sense to display the breakdown of all eligible votes instead of just a breakdown of votes cast.

I imagine this would make the chart look something like `Didnâ€™t vote | Yes | No` instead of just `Yes | No`

Totally agree with this suggestion! We had designs for this at one point:

I have this on the [proposal page](https://ic.rocks/proposal/7852) if you need something for now
