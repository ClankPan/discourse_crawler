Hi ICP Community,

We are pleased to announce the final milestone of our first grant for Ping. 

Ping is a notification service that boosts ecosystem engagement by creating a direct communication channel between dapp developers and their respective users.

Dapp developers can create a profile of their dapp, and send updates to their users. Meanwhile, the dapp users can view the list of all registered dapps, and subscribe to the ones that are relevant to them for updates. 

You can watch this short [demo](https://www.loom.com/share/586d9b2cfe8a453bb0ae698fbc01f64a?sid=b1978f10-85b0-4629-9a0a-c01f234ad32d) to get a better understanding of how it works. You can also check out the live version deployed here - [h7jna-pqaaa-aaaak-afgiq-cai.icp0.io/](https://h7jna-pqaaa-aaaak-afgiq-cai.icp0.io/)

The application is in POC stage at the moment. Next steps are to enhance the existing functionalities further by adding more details to Dapp (publisher) profiles, enhance user flows and improve the UI further. We also plan to add a module that can deliver realtime updates about on-chain activities related to each dapp. 

Do check it out & let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions! :)

You can reach out on Discord, the handle is "saumay_". Looking forward to hearing back from you all.
