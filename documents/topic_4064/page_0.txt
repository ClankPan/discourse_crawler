the value of "voting power" more bigger, the more opportunities or more easier to vote to reward ICP？
Can I understand in this way?

The more voting power, the more power to change the outcome of a vote.

Example:
Two Voters `A` and `B` 
`A` has a voting power of 100
`B` has a voting power of 200

Both vote on proposal `x `.
`B`'s vote counts twice as much and rewards are twice as big.

> The voting power of neurons, and their relative claim to voting rewards, is proportional to the quantity of staked ICP, the length of the configured dissolve delay, and their “age.”

> The voting power of a neuron at a given point in time is computed as follows:
*neuron_stake * dissolve_delay_bonus * age_bonus*
