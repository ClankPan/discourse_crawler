Hi

[via Motoko]
so I transferred some ICP using "transfer" call on NNS Ledger canister, and it returned me { Ok: nat64 }. Is there a way to verify this? on my canister, there will be a `public shared({caller}) iHavePaid(to: Principal, transferResult: Nat64)` function, how should I verify the `transferResult`?

[via browsing web]
I did check the transaction at dashboard.internetcomputer.org and the `transferResult` is the block index(? pls correct me if i'm wrong), but the real identifier on the transaction history there was the Hash. If I search on the dashboard by using the block index, i get nothing, but when i use the hash, it will redirect me to the transaction detail.

[via Motoko]
How can i get the transaction details by using this block index so that i can verify it myself like so: (`payer == caller and payee == to and total == amount`)?

Also
I did try `dfx canister call nnsledger query_block` and it gave me this

How am I supposed to make sense of this? I dont know what is what :frowning: 

Thank you :slight_smile:

Have a look at the [Ledger documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/). A lot of it is explained in these documents.

For Motoko interactions with the ledger, have a look at the [defi](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/defi) and [ledger-transfer](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/ledger-transfer) examples. There you can see how to interact with the ledger, and from the full ledger interface (see link below or in the docs) you figure out what exact functions you want to call.

`dfx canister call` outputs encoded candid keys. If you want to see the decoded keys, download [this file](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/rosetta-api/icp_ledger/ledger.did), can point to it using `dfx canister call <...other args> --candid <path/to/ledger.did>`

Hi Severin
Thanks for coming to my rescue

Got it, so the `blockIndex` will only get returned after a `Successful` or `Completed` token transfer, as below

![image|690x322](upload://uZZqmeN5LupRNzqraXOqiieai9S.png)

One last question tho,
Can there be a block index with `Failed` or `Incomplete` transfer status? or will it ALWAYS 100% `Successful`?

I'm asking because, if the `blockIndex` can be `Failed`, then whats gonna happen when a user just pass a `Failed` `blockIndex` to my `verifyTransfer(blockIndex: Nat64, memo: Nat64, sender: Principal, receiver: Principal, amount_e8s: Nat64)`? What if this function queries the ledger canister for the block, then find all these properties to be matched? Won't that be unfair? since the user failed to transfer, yet he will be treated as if his transfer was successful (since the status (`Success`/`Fail`) is not included the transaction detail).

Or am I looking too much into this? 

Thank you again.

Where do you get the idea that there could be an incomplete transfer? If you look at [`TransferResult`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/rosetta-api/icp_ledger/ledger.did#L76-L79) you can see that it is either `Ok(blockIndex)` or `Err(transferError)`. There is no option for an incomplete transfer. If the transfer fails then no block is created.

Thanks @Severin

The blcokchain explorer accepts the `BlockIndex` but only int he URL, not as a search query.

So to get what you want, simply construct the URL like this:
````
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/`BlockIndex`
````

For example: `https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/10500226`

thanks. i just knew about this! 
anyway, back then im still learning about crypto, turns out i shouldve clarified that i want to verify the tx on-chain, instead of off-chain (like what you suggested).
