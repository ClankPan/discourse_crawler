**Welcome to the DFINITY Discourse Forum!**

In this post, you’ll find some helpful information and resources about DFINITY as well as some guidelines for contributing to and interacting within our forum.

**Introduction to DFINITY and the Internet Computer**

DFINITY is a not-for-profit foundation dedicated to developing and supporting the Internet Computer. The Internet Computer is extending the internet by providing new functionality to host software and services directly on the internet. The internet's newfound ability to host software is made possible by a network of independent data centers around the world running an open protocol called ICP (Internet Computer Protocol).

Our mission is to make it easy for developers to create decentralized applications that are tamperproof, fast, and incorporate privacy innovations capable of scaling to millions of users around the world.

A quick note on utilizing the DFINITY Community Forum: 

As you participate here, we’ll get to know you, and temporary new user limitations will be lifted. There is a 24h quarantine before you can post, while waiting for this time to pass, please spend some time "reading" articles while awaiting your quarantine period to end. 

All new users start out in a sandbox with restrictions for everyone’s safety. Not to worry! New users can transition to level 1 within 10 mins of reading.

Get to trust level 1 by…

* Entering at least 5 topics
* Reading at least 30 posts
* Spend a total of 10 minutes reading posts

With trust level 1 you will be able to use all core Discourse functions.

Moderators and community members of a trust level of 4 or higher reserve the right to curate topics shared within the DFINITY Community Forum to ensure that we retain a positive environment for all users.
