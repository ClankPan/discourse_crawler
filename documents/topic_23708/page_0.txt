I have some USDC in Metamask I would like to convert to ICP and transfer to my ICP wallet. What is the best channel I can use to achieve this?

The easiest way currently would be to transfer your USDC to an exchange which lists ICP as a trading pair. Then swap USDC to ICP, then withdraw the ICP from the exchange to to your ICP wallet. 

In the near future you will be able to use the ETH -> ckETH minter to bridge ETH and any other ERC-20 from Ethereum to IC. 

However this isn't ready yet, so for now the easiest way would be to use any centralized exchange with ICP as a trading pair.
