Hello everyone, we are the Goji team. After engaging with the Goji Hub, we've decided to build our project within the IC ecosystem. Goji is a subscription-based social entertainment website. In short, it's the web3 version of OnlyFans. Our team consists of veterans with decades of experience in the adult entertainment industry, boasting extensive and profound connections in the online adult entertainment sector. We can reach out to anyone in the industry with just a phone call. We understand the needs of content creators and viewers in this industry and believe we can leverage the concepts and technological advantages of web3 to address them. We also have producers of web3 projects on our team to ensure it's a successful web3 project. 

Our goal at Goji is to offer more content, earn more money for all parties, and have more fun. We hope to engage more with the community here. We believe Goji will undoubtedly be a hugely attractive project. Let's Goji!
