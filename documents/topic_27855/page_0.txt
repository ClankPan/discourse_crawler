PizzaX is a Lifetime Generating smart contract It gives you a cool APR for investing your money. Think of PizzaX Miner as a safe box where you put your money and it turns into something called 'Pizza' in the app. This project gives you back up to 15% of what you put in every day.

Miner Pools:

PizzaX offers different "flavors" (Pools) for $PizzaX, stablecoin (USDT) and BNB. What sets PizzaX apart is that it doesn't require its own project token For the USDT and BNB pool.
