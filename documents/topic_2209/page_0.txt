How would I e.g.

- Govern the sale of shares of my service to investors?
- Govern the amount of shares my service consists of (dilution)?
- Paying for ICP cycles? 
- Pay contributors (coders, designers, content creators, other services i consume) with either ICP Utility Tokens, service shares or other currencies
- Employ similar neuron / vote / ICP Utility Tokens mechanisms as used on the NNS level to govern decisions about changes within my service.

Do i for all of the above have to roll my own from scratch or will there be building blocks available that simplify creating such mechanics for my service when i do this on the ICP?

There are a lot more details coming out soon and itâ€™ll be really interesting to explore all of this, but what was discussed a while back is the idea that your services can inherit a base governance mechanism from the NNS, which you can build on top of.

Thanks. That would make a lot of sense and would be very useful, i suppose.
