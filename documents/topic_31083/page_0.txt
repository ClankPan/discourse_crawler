What type of topic is this?

I'm building a canister that includes indexing data and I was wondering how I would store information that would be in SQL form. Can I store an SQL lite engine in the canister and read/write data to it until it hits capacity and create a new one? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I assume that you are using Typescript but will provide information for other languages as well.

1. There have been attempts to create relational databases on ICP (see the Backend -> Databases section [here](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/4965948618772-What-are-some-developer-resources-for-building-on-the-Internet-Computer)) but these are all not currently maintained. 
2. The Azle CDK (Typescript) plans to enable connecting a SQL database to a canister by the end of the year.

Your best bets immediately are:
1. [CanDB](https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/CanDB) which is a non-relational database is still maintained. 
2. Stable Structures in [Rust](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/stable-structures) / [Typescript](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/stable_structures.html) / [Python](https://demergent-labs.github.io/kybra/stable_structures.html), [Stable Regions](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/stable-memory/stable-regions) in Motoko
