Does anyone has an open source Motoko function to share that extract the information of an url intercepted by `http_request`?

```
public shared query({caller}) func http_request({method: Text; url: Text;} : HttpRequest) : async HttpResponse {
     let {hostname; pathname; search} = myCoolFunction(url);
...
```

Found a regex on SO (a bit ashamed I did not write it by myself) but, not sure how to use it with [Text.split](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/base-libraries/Text.html#type.Pattern) which does not seem to support regex.

```
^(([^:\/?#]+):)?(\/\/([^\/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
```

Yeah, no regex engine in Motoko yet. Someone would have to (and should) write a library for HTTP stuff for  Motoko! (Likely easier than a full-blown regex engine)
