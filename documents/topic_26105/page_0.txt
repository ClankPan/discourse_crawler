Hey All,

I was sitting there the other day wishing I could use some of my maturity within a staked neuron for a launchpad project but by the time I would have spawned it, the project would have closed.

Is there a potential to allow for stake maturity to have a 
more streamlined process to commit to launchpad project?

Keen to get some peoples opinions on this.
