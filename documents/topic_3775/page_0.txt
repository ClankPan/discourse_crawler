Would be nice to see this and other governance-related metrics (neuron concentration by Internet Identity, average age of neurons, average dissolve delay of neurons, etc.), perhaps on such dashboards as those below:

Hoping to revisit this, in light of all the great work that's now been done to enhance the NNS and related tooling. I wonder if it's possible to get a view into some of these governance-related metrics?
