Does anyone have any bright ideas on how to have dfx build xxxxxx detect if files have changed? Or do you have a good strategy for detecting this in bash?  I'm sitting around waiting quite a bit these days and much of the time I'm waiting on repeat builds.

I think it comes down to whatever commands `dfx build` issues having support for this.

I use nix, and one benefit of that is only rebuilding what is necessary.

My workflow for dev vs production builds is different though so thereâ€™s still room for improvement.

Other than looking up the docs, any pointers/resources/samples of how to do this with nix that you'd recommend?

Thereâ€™s a learning curve ðŸ˜…

Maybe start with [Nix Pills: Chapter 6. Our First Derivation](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/our-first-derivation.html) and look at previous chapters if necessary.
