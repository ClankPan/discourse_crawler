when i call the  update function  of canister, it has an error:

I wonder if this is a problem with the dfinity network or something else。 Because sometimes requests are normal。


And I want to know the conclusion about the update method call. Calling the same method of the same cansiter, is the request queued? For example, if I have 1000 users calling the same method of the same canister at the same time, then one of the users may need to wait for more than 1000 * 2 s to get the result.

by default dfinity has 60sec timeout, so for your update calls sometimes consensus is taking too much time , and hence your update calls getting timeout....
But it should not happen with query calls, can you brief me more about your issue with query calls ?
