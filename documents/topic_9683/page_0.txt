 ([quote="zire, post:105, topic:7896"]
In the meanwhile, OP/BOSS still want to submit an NNS proposal to recover their account. If OP/BOSS can gather enough votes in favor of this proposal, technically speaking this is not entirely impossible.

The issue is that Dfinity has the power to reset everyone's account in Internet Identity. The issue is NOT that Dfinity would willingly do this. But what if a nation actor forced such an action on Dfinity, was the thought that came to mind.

Are you sure they werenâ€™t just talking about the NNS having this capability?
