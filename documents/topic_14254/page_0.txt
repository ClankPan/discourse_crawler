Do you get any errors in the browser console? Those could be very helpful to diagnose.

By the way, what version of dfx (and WSL maybe) are you running? We've had reports of WSL not working at all with currently shipping replicas.

yes it shows image favicon and stylesheet not found futher when i check the Network tab it is fetching image from: http://localhost:8080/logo.png and failed that's why i was wondering maybe i need to do something with port forwarding maybe localhost is not accessing data from virtual linux also from an external image url it looks like it it working updating the screenshots for the better understanding.

dfx 0.10.1
Ubuntu version 2

welp... I'm getting the same on my macOS machine. I'll ask around in the team. This certainly is not a problem with WSL.

To see things properly, you can run `dfx deploy` instead of `npm start`. This will not have hot-reloading, so you'll have to `dfx deploy` all the time, but it should work. You can then see your app if you go to the URL displayed by `dfx deploy`.

I tried a few more things. Looks like the problem is in some dependencies. I'm not good enough with webpack/npm to fix it, and even less so on someone else's machine. But... if you want it working from `dfx new`, you can build the latest dfx from master. It's not hard. Just `cargo build` after cloning https://github.com/dfinity/sdk.

not able to proceed anyone from team can help me out why the images and css is not generating 
I m using these versions


```
:~/Projects/hello$ dfx --version
dfx 0.10.1
:~/Projects/hello$ dfx cache list
0.9.3
0.10.1 *
:~/Projects/hello$ npm --version
8.11.0
:~/Projects/hello$ node --version
v16.16.0

    "webpack": "^5.72.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.10.0",
```
here should be my assets(images and css) in dist/hello_assets folder i guess but it seems it is not getting generated by webpack

```
:~/Projects/hello$ ls -lah dist/hello_assets
total 1.3M
drwxr-xr-x 2 jarralz jarralz 4.0K Jul 14 10:25 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 jarralz jarralz 4.0K Jul 14 10:25 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 jarralz jarralz  663 Jul 14 10:25 index.html

-rw-r--r-- 1 jarralz jarralz 665K Jul 14 10:25 index.js.map
```

The only discrepancy between our configurations is the node version:
```
‚ùØ node --version 
v18.3.0
```
If this also doesn't help, can you try `dfx upgrade`? A new version just dropped that should have working versions in it again.

this breaking change (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-0-11-0-is-promoted-with-breaking-changes/14327?u=peterparker) sounds like the reason of the issue
