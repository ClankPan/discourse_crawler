Hi, just a weird issue on my Iphone8.

Got an anchor (created in iphone6) and added this new device (iphone8) to that anchor.

NNS dapp is functionally in Iphone6 but a "blank" white screen appears (with no error type) in my new device (Iphone8). Looks like there's a problem loading in the main screen for login.

Just reboot the two iphone but still isn't running in Iphone 8.


Any kind of bug? or just missed something?

Thank's in advance

Hello Giorgio, thanks for contacting us.

First, let's do some basic checking:
-Check if your browser and iOs are updated to the latest version. If not, do it and try again.
-Check if your clock time is aligned with the world time.
-If you use FaceID to enter NNS, please be sure it's activated and working properly.
 
After checking these, please let us know if it worked. If you need any help, you can contact us directly on the Support channel, sending a message to support@dfinity.org.

Hey guys :slight_smile: 

I'm having the same issue, iOS 16.4.1 (a) (made April 2023, way later than the original topic was started).
