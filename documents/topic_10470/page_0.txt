When I upgrade to dfx 0.9.0 and run `dfx generate`, I get this error:

```
Cannot open ""
```

No idea why...

is it for Motoko? If so, we're aware of it and fixing it now

Is this resolved yet?

@kpeacock Sorry to bother, but is it safe to upgrade to 0.9.0 again?

`dfx 0.9.1-beta.0` is ready to use. `0.9.0` specifically is a failed build and will be skipped over when 0.9.1 is released

Thanks, looking forward to it.
