Dear all

Suddenly started getting CORS error on a deployed page

Access to fetch at 'https://mainnet.dfinity.network/api/v2/status' from origin 'https://fdgffg-naaaa-aaaal-adbpq-cai.icp0.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource

And CORS is clearing and appearing again after sometime,

Any suggestions ?

Thanks

Hey @gladguy 

I can't really reproduce what you are experiencing. Is this really the correct canister ID? If you don't want to put it here, you can also send it to me as direct message.

In general, `mainnet.dfinity.network` should **not** be used for API calls (status, read state, query, and update). `icp-api.io` should be used for that.
