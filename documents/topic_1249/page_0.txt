Hello everyone!

`V0.6.7` of the SDK is now available for download, and it's a good one! :star_struck: 

This release includes the following new features and capabilities:

* The  `dfx build`  command now supports building a specific canister, in addition to building all canisters.

  For example, you can compile the code for a back-end canister without building the canister used for your projectâ€™s front-end assets.

  Because of this change to the  `dfx build`  command, the  `--skip-frontend`  option is no longer needed and has been removed.

* There are several new  `dfx identity`  commands that enable you to create, manage, and switch between different user identities when communicating with the Internet Computer network.

  You can also use a new  `--identity`  command-line option to set a specific user context when running  `dfx`  commands.

  This new support for multiple identities enables you to test role-based access control for your programs.

* Updates to the Candid argument parser in  `dfx canister call`  include the following user-facing features:

  * Support type annotations when parsing Candid values. For example, you can use the following syntax to specify types: `(42: nat8, vec {1;-3;5} : vec int8)`

  * Support for pretty-print decoded Candid values:
`--output pp`  is the default and prints the value in multiple lines.
`--output idl`  prints the value in a single line.

  * Support for  `float e`  notation.
  * Support for Rust-like parsing errors.

* Key updates for Motoko include the following:

  * Support for polymorphic equality that enables the  `==`  and  `!=`  operators to work on all shareable types.
  * Improvements to catch clashing function and class declarations.
  * Language support to enable canisters to take installation arguments.
  * Optimized backend handling for  `Bool`  data types.

Happy coding! :rocket:
