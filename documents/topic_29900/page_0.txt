I think there's an issue in the documentation of the periodic timers using rust. Here's the link to the documentation (https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/timers) 

The command "dfx deploy my_timers_backend --argument 1" has an error. When we're deploying the canister, we need to pass in the --argument flag (which is done) followed by the argument serialized in candid format. The argument in the command isn't serialized in candid format. 

The serialized format for a single integer is "(integer_value:nat64)". Therefore the correct command should be: dfx deploy my_timers_backend --argument "(1:nat64)"

I didn't try the tutorial, but I tried to deploy the [example `timer` canister](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/periodic_tasks) using the latest `dfx`:

```shell
a@b ~/tmp/examples/rust/periodic_tasks % dfx --version
dfx 0.19.0

a@b ~/tmp/examples/rust/periodic_tasks % git log -1 --oneline
688682ef (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) ...

a@b ~/tmp/examples/rust/periodic_tasks % dfx deploy timer --argument 1

```

Seems everything just works...

I guess you missed the [Declaring the Canister Interface](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/timers#declaring-the-canister-interface) step, but it's hard to be sure without the actual code.
