I am skeptical about the people spreading FUD, Does he short $ICP? What's his true intention? Vibes like that only make the whole ecosystem bearish.

I wouldn't blame any developers if they are confident about the security part. Audits from good providers are expensive, as there are not many IC Projects, and will take some time as well. 

Other DEXes in IC are audited? If not, does the liquidity in those DEX es safe? Do you think Dfinity can say the same, not audited, not safe? Sonic is here for a while, and I believe they are comparatively secure compared to other ones.

People need to understand the risk-reward tradeoffs, appreciate efforts to build the ecosystem, and grow together as a community.

That sums it up very well and gives very good advice for the team. If they really want to go forward in the long run and not rush things that is the only way. Time will tell I guess, meanwhile we have clear [guidelines](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-launch-checklist/19855) .

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-18 08:09:46 UTC | #108

As far as the FUD is concerned yes I have to agree there is no reason for it in this case even though I was one to mock sonic for the repos after a rushed decision to open source them when they faced that part. I am sure that no developer or any serious project will leave IC just because Dfinity gave guidelines and did not vote on a proposal. On the other hand looks like some users holding ICP lost their patience and will lash out on anyone and anything as long as the price is still around $5 hence the guy with the shorting.

-------------------------

I liked a lot of what the Psych team were doing but they turned out to be money grabbing mercenaries. They got a hell of a lot of money from Dfinity, built decent apps but didn't focus on scaling or pushing them hard. They created lots of projects but never really followed through on any of them. Then fell out with Dfinity and the community and left. 

Now it seems they want 4% of Sonic tokens for a product which was likely already funded/ developed using Dfinity grants. Seems like a kick in the face for the ICP community IMHO!

-------------------------

AslamVA | 2023-05-18 14:15:57 UTC | #110

I do have a feeling that the Sonic team was in a rush, Maybe a lot of these discussions could taken in private, instead of causing chaos in the ecosystem. Perhaps a seed round through funded or something would have been a better choice for Sonic if they need funds for development. 

Regardless if the community is more interested in mocking each other instead of supporting and making better products, the ecosystem will be only bearish, everyone will be in loss loss situation.

## 1. The Foundation Should Focus Solely on the Protocol Level, and Not the Application Level

One of our biggest critiques is the constant attempts by the DFINITY foundation to build at the application level of the IC.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems you are right they have stated they do not want to build the application level and criticise DFINITY for their progress but here we are with a working application and ready to go.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-18 21:01:05 UTC | #112

It is not all black or white, I did the mocking where it held it's own, just as you said it was rushed. But at the end of the day I am all for making the majority happy and by that I mean the community as long as the rules of engagement from Dfinity are clear. Just to be on the same page : it does not matter if Sonic misses this, I am willing to help and support them in any way I can if they choose to go forward and I bet that many devs will follow. I and We want Sonic to be the project that raises the bar for other new comers  in the ecosystem. And the same applies for Kinic and the rest.

@diegop why do we have to look at all these Twitter posts?

[quote="wpb, post:100, topic:19716"]
t’s people posting sound bites made by other people from other peoples content…3 levels deep. I think they are a distraction to meaningful conversation on the forum. I would vote for minimizing them if they are not original content.
[/quote]

Hi @wpb ,

I've put more thought into this than I ever expected :upside_down_face:, but I re-read the posts and my honest opinion (as a moderator) is that:

1. They are indeed confusing to me and takes a while for me to understand the intent, but the intent does seem relevant to the conversation and on-topic... so they are not completely off-topic random. They just take a lot of mental bandwidth to understand and dive down into (akin to reading someone's super long comment).

2. They *sometimes* have some snark... but are not ad hominem.

3. The developer forum UI does give them some prominence...but not sure I can do anything about that, and specially since it has not been an issue before.

4. Yes they are tweets... but i think sharing tweets is fine. I see the " [Post Only Your Own Stuff](https://forum.dfinity.org/faq#stealing)" different than posting twitter links (which are public), this is akin to posting wikipedia links.

5. These do not seem to derail the health of the dialogue... so my main concern (healthy dialogue) is satisfied.

If anyone disagrees, I am here and always willing to change my mind.

wpb | 2023-05-18 22:12:26 UTC | #114

Ok, thanks for the feedback.  You know my opinion, but I respect your role as the moderator and I don’t feel the need to push the issue any further.  Thank you for considering the matter.

Id like to apologize to everyone else in this thread for I will have to comment *beyond* this topic and address @CatPirate ’s recent rants:

1. As a moderator of this forum,  **I have indefinitely removed @CatPirate** .  They were previously silenced and warned many times, but they have not shown to be a good member of this community. This means they cannot comment or post new topics. I have sent them this message:

> After your previous warnings, today's comments show you have acted in bad faith. You have been silenced indefinitely from the developer forum. You will not be able to comment or start posts.

2. I would typically delete catpirate's trollish comments (indeed multiple people flagged/reported them), but I am leaving them for the purposes of transparency to show my thinking because:

* silencing a user indefinitely is not something to be taken lightly so I want to show my thinking
* the comments were mostly directed at me. If they had been directed at other people, I would remove them (so there is no ad hominem).

3. People will disagree in many topics, so it is important that healthy dialogue be kept. Indeed, I know I have had my mind changed many times here, as I knkw others have. To be frank, this developer forum was initially created with the intent of answering only coding questions, and clearly the scope has organically grown so I have tried to adapt with the community and their needs. There are many forums and places for ICP discussions. This is just one of many, so I hope I can create a good environment for those who spend their time here.

That is all. Apologies for the distraction.

Can understand, I am coming from Polygon, FIL coin ecosystem. TBH I felt like IC ecosystem is way different from what I have seen. The ecosystem grows only when people see it as a positive sum game. 

I am bullish on the Sonic team, as I am aware of the few projects by some of the team members in other L1s. Still skeptical about dfinity though.

To be fair:

1. I warned the user many, many times across period of months

2. I gave the user a 1-month silencing period and warned them that more bad faith behavior would result in permanent action 

3. **This is the FIRST time in the 3 years** I have moderated this forum that this has happened. And believe me, this forum like all blockchain forums attracts some questionable behaviors. This is not r/askhistorians.

I am a user of many online forums as I’m sure you are, and i think the above is a reasonable way in today’s world.

Now that i laid out the basics, I am open to feedback, what would you recommend?

NFHX | 2023-05-19 14:29:32 UTC | #132

Your message looks completely AI generated.

Also, did you not read the reply of @diegop? Should he silence him 1 more month every time? This is ridiculous, he gave him plenty of chance to not flame and troll this forum. If users like this just want to insult others, they can go back to reddit.

Well, it seems that the Sonic SNS proposal (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122343) won't pass, but Sonic SNS DAO section is already on IC Dashboard, (part of) tokens minted...

-------------------------

Dylan | 2023-05-19 16:04:20 UTC | #135

We are discussing how to handle this on the IC dashboard. The [SNS-WASM canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai) considers Sonic a deployed SNS, which is why the IC dashboard lists it. Listing this prior to a decentralization swap is useful, so that NNS voters have easy access to view information about a potential SNS. However, the IC dashboard needs to indicate whether an SNS has launched or not, which it's not currently doing. For example, right now the Sonic SNS on the IC dashboard could be labeled as "Swap Pending", whereas SNS-1 and OpenChat could be labeled as "Launched".

I think Dfinity need serious auditing process before sonic or any dApss...

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-19 17:59:16 UTC | #137

The true answer to most problems are well known but not practiced.

DFINITY rebuilt the internet networking system from the ground up which fixes many of the problems of the current internet.

It has also improved and I am no expert and overcome many of the problems of a username and password. 

At no time have I provided a username or password to get on the NNS and it does not store username and passwords on a centralised network where points of control can be vulnerable to hacking attempts and data breaches. 

The problem with most security starts with the account holder and I still see issues with account holders losing access to their account on the NNS.

The traditional network systems use superficial fixes for security on top of the software topology.

DFINITY rebuilt the base to overcome many of the issues at the source.

The IC enables users to have more control over their personal data and selectively share it with trusted parties, reducing the reliance on traditional usernames and passwords.

Here we are with many of the fixes to usernames and passwords and just recently a project on the IC had major issues with usernames. 

This also highlights the need for a security audit for new projects as many still think and create in the old methods not understanding the need for application level importance but in a hurry to build projects for funding with superficial appeal.

We need to make sure any projects we want to fund must comply with the new standards of the IC which must start with a strong and secure application base with a great idea built on top.

The latest IC dashboard release contains the change I described in my earlier message, to display the *status* of an SNS.

Under the current system of creating an SNS, first steps are to create an [Update Allowed Principals proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122209), and once that has executed, to call [deploy_new_sns ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/3695d96de813fe039ab0a533137ad3d5a55836f6/rs/nns/sns-wasm/src/sns_wasm.rs#L519) on the [SNS-WASM canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai), which installs the SNS. Once these steps are complete, the IC dashboard will display the *potential* SNS in its [list of SNSs](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns). At this point, the status of the SNS will be "**Swap Pending**".

After those steps are completed, an [Open Decentralization Swap proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122343) is created. If this proposal is adopted and executed, the status of the SNS will change to "**Swap Open**". If this proposal is rejected, as it was for Sonic today, the status of the SNS will change to "**Swap Failed**".

After a decentralization swap is successfully completed, the status of the SNS will change to "**Launched**".

We may fine tune these SNS status labels, but this is what was implemented in today's IC dashboard release.

HI @Dylan 

I am a private sale investor of SONIC. It seems that tokens already distributed to some wallets, How could we see the token, since it is not visible in NNS wallet. When are you going to add it in NNS wallet?

-------------------------

Dylan | 2023-05-21 20:28:35 UTC | #147

I don't know the answer to that, but my guess would be that only ICRC-1 tokens of launched SNSs will be added to the NNS front-end dapp, so if Sonic made another attempt to launch as an SNS and it succeeded, presumably the SOC token would be added to the NNS front-end dapp.
