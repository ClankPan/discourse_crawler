**Introduction**
Hello everyone, I'm known as [CakeMaker](https://twitter.com/cakemakerone) in the Sonic community, and I'm a part of the core development team. Over the past few weeks, we have been working closely with the Dfinity team to launch our SNS proposal. Our community is already aware of this, and I'm thrilled to share more details about our proposal and whitepaper through this forum post.

This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the Sonic SNS and ask the founding dev team any questions.

Sonic is a DeFI/AMM protocol on the Internet Computer, leveraging the IC's unlimited scalability to provide a collection of DeFI products, including swaps, liquidity, and more.

For those who may not be familiar with Sonic, it is a project that is outlined in detail in our whitepaper. https://sonicdex.gitbook.io/sonic-whitepaper/. 

**What's next?** 
Once the development team receives adequate feedback and comments, a proposal will be launched to enable principal tu57s-7iaaa-aaaal-achra-cai in SNS-W for the initiation of an SNS generation on Sonic DEX.

Which proposal? Do you have a proposal number?

Also, since this is your first post, would you mind giving some extra info so we can verify this is you? Maybe a tweet or something along those lines

Hi Severin,

I apologize for the typo in my earlier post. I have corrected it now, and I would like to share the official tweet about the forum post. - https://twitter.com/sonic_ooo/status/1653415748495081477?s=20

Hey Buddy! Great to see things moving forward with Sonic. I'm a big fan. I've read the whitepaper which is very detailed and no doubting the experience of the dev team. Playing devils advocate I've got a couple of questions... 

1) Is the SNS launch too early in your roadmap? Should the product be built out more and then launched via SNS? 

2) Does SNS launch potentially slow down the development process due to the voting process of deploying each update? (Kinda linked to Q1)

3) I know there will be some questions over the regulatory environment of synthetic assets... is early SNS launch a mitigation of this? (I appreciate that you might not want to go 'on the record' on this topic. Its potentially a tricky one but I know people might be thinking it) 

4) I know you guys are looking at metamask integration. Are you working with Funded to keep Plug wallet development up to speed with any Sonic changes? How about other ICP wallets? (I imagine using ICRC standards help here)

5) Any plans to re-launch WICP on ICRC standards? 

Whatever happens I'll be rooting for you guys! We need great teams like you on the IC!

Take it easy guys! 

Nathan

Thanks, Nathan,

Answering your questions below 

1. The decision to implement SNS for Sonic was made following careful planning of our roadmap and vision board. In order to achieve our goals, we require funding to expand our team and ensure legal and compliance measures are in place. Currently, Sonic lacks an audit and compliance framework, which poses a risk not only for our platform but for every DEX in light of ongoing SEC regulatory issues. Adherence to regulations is critical for scaling, and it is imperative that we follow these guidelines for long-term success.

2. While the SNS launch introduces a governance mechanism that allows the community to vote on updates and proposals, we have considered measures to ensure the development process remains agile and efficient. The SNS voting process is already designed to be transparent and streamlined, and we are committed to balancing community input with the need for timely development and innovation.

3. As an organization, we take regulatory compliance very seriously and are actively monitoring developments in the regulatory environment for synthetic assets. While SNS may provide some level of decentralization, it is not intended as a specific mitigation strategy for regulatory concerns. We will continue to work with legal counsel and regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

4.  We are actively working to ensure compatibility and integration with a variety of wallets, including MetaMask, Plug Wallet, and other ICP wallets. Our goal is to provide users with flexibility and choice in how they interact with the platform. However, we are not involved in any development process of Plug. 

5. Not at the moment. 

Thank you, Nathan for the support.

Hi @memecake, 

Are there parts of the Sonic system that the sns will not have cryptographic control of? Such as off-chain or centralized infrastructure?

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-02 21:45:26 UTC | #7

Great question @levi 

Our goal is to ensure that as much of the system as possible is under the cryptographic control of the SNS to enable community governance and decision-making. However, there may be certain components or aspects of the platform that require off-chain for practical or technical reasons. These components could include, for example, third-party integrations or certain user interface elements. We recognize the importance of minimizing reliance on centralized infrastructure, and we will continuously work to enhance the decentralization and security of the platform.

We are also committed to being transparent with our community about the architecture of the platform and any components that may involve off-chain elements.

As we continue to develop and improve the Sonic platform, we will actively explore opportunities to further decentralize these components and increase the level of cryptographic control exercised by the SNS.

Just following up on @levi's question: Is there an architecture description of Sonic? As in: which canisters is Sonic comprised of, and which exact parts of the architecture are on-chain vs. off-chain? For instance, a simple lookup of [Sonic's main URL](https://app.sonic.ooo/) indicates that the app front end is served from AWS, which may mean it's not under the control of the SNS.

1. We have mainly Swap, Liquidity and Assets APIs and all of them routed through single canister **3xwpq-ziaaa-aaaah-qcn4a-cai**. The high level and technical level components details are covered [here](https://docs.sonic.ooo/).
2. We evaluated different options for hosting frontend, one of our major concern is most of the icp domains being [blacklisted](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/important-community-update-on-ic0-app-domain-being-flagged-by-an-anti-spam-blocklist/18537) by major ISPs. We are currently evaluating custom domain mapping [support](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/deploy/custom-domain)  and looking at new boundary node [updates](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/content-filtering-via-boundary-nodes/18196/3). The updated FE canister will be added to SNS DAO later via proposal

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-05-03 06:03:45 UTC | #10

How many canisters are there in total? Why can't the FE be added before SNS? I agree that blacklisted domains create a huge issue, however I think this problem prob needs to be solved at the network level. Also will the code be open source after listing on SNS? Otherwise how can the community audit the code?

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-03 12:39:49 UTC | #11

The Sonic front end canisters are already developed, but they are not yet live due to the reasons mentioned earlier. Once the issues are resolved, we can move our front end from AWS and go live with canisters. https://eukbz-7iaaa-aaaah-ac5tq-cai.icp0.io 

Sonic will be fully open source post SNS.

What does “routed through a single canister” mean? 
Is it just that the canister saves the request and then an off-chain service polls the canister for the requests and processes the transactions in the off-chain service?

-------------------------

sideffect0 | 2023-05-04 05:56:29 UTC | #13

> What does “routed through a single canister” mean?

We do have inter canister calls to token canisters, but currently we don't have any off-chain service polls or anything similar.
All of the transaction processing, requests processing etc. happens within the mentioned swap canister.

I think a high-level architectural overview of your setup is needed for this thread. It's not clear how much of Sonic is on-chain and off-chain. Also I think it's important that your project is open-source _before_ the sale, from what I can see you plan to open-source after. Would you reconsider this decision?

-------------------------

Bugslayer | 2023-05-04 12:19:26 UTC | #15

Hi @NathanosDev 
All of our FE components are now deployed in respective canisters. Sonic is now fully on chain. 

sonic dapp FE : eukbz-7iaaa-aaaah-ac5tq-cai (https://app.sonic.ooo)
sonic analytics FE:  fxgi7-lqaaa-aaaah-ac5va-cai (https://data.sonic.ooo)

The only off-chain component that Sonic relies on is the graphql api server for analytics. The purpose of this api server is to act as ETL component that process and organize raw data retrieved from the canister, which is then presented in the analytics section of sonic. Unfortunately, we have not yet identified a suitable alternative for implementing this feature within the canister.

[/quote]


As you have correctly pointed out, our initial plan was to open-source after the sale. However, after taking into consideration the feedback from the Dfinity team & community, we have decided to prioritize this and open-source our project before SNS. We believe that open sourcing-before the sale is crucial for establishing trust and building a strong foundation for our project. 
Thank you again for your valuable input, and we look forward to making this happen within few days.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-05-04 13:04:04 UTC | #17

This is fantastic @Bugslayer! Thank you for your quick turn around on the feedback. I'm glad that you can see the value of establishing trust with the community through transparency.

Just to clarify something that was said earlier:
> We have mainly Swap, Liquidity and Assets APIs and all of them routed through single canister **3xwpq-ziaaa-aaaah-qcn4a-cai** . The high level and technical level components details are covered here.

If I understand correctly now, you have multiple canisters, one for each of these APIs, but they are all proxied by a single canister? Or they all exist on the same canister?

-------------------------

yes, they all exists on the same canister

Thanks for the clarification!

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-04 18:25:19 UTC | #20

For further clarity, I am adding below info for the community to review - 


**Sonic component level details**


All types of Sonic V1 transactions are handled by the swap canister (3xwpq-ziaaa-aaaah-qcn4a-cai). The canister has three main logical components.

1. Swap Router
Swaps are the action of trading one asset for another with an opposing party, oftentimes overseen by a trusted third party. With Swap Router, users can deposit a token and receive their desired token automatically in a trustless fashion. A full swap through the Sonic Swap API has four update calls documented here.
https://docs.sonic.ooo/developer-guides/swap-example


2. Liquidity Pool
      A liquidity pool holds a balance of the two tokens that make up the top-level swap pair. Users who want to make a swap are actually trading with the underlying liquidity pool. Liquidity pools price their assets based on the ratio of the underlying assets. Users who want to make a swap are actually trading with the underlying liquidity pool. Liquidity pools price their assets based on the ratio of the underlying assets. The component exposes two major apis addLiquidityaddLiquidity and removeLiquidityremoveLiquidity, the transaction flow of these apis are documented here. 
https://docs.sonic.ooo/developer-guides/liquidity-example


3. Asset Wallet
This component gives users a way to hold their assets within the canister so that they can process any LP or Swap related transaction much faster. The Asset wallet api currently follows a standard derived from DIP20, an example flow of using this api is documented here  
https://docs.sonic.ooo/dev/assets-api

**Decentralisation & Voting power**
Sonic will be decentralised with all our codes are deployed in canisters, the canister details are shown below

3xwpq-ziaaa-aaaah-qcn4a-cai (sonic swap)
eukbz-7iaaa-aaaah-ac5tq-cai (sonic frontend,https://app.sonic.ooo/ )
fxgi7-lqaaa-aaaah-ac5va-cai (sonic analytics, https://data.sonic.ooo/)
utozz-siaaa-aaaam-qaaxq-cai (wicp)
aanaa-xaaaa-aaaah-aaeiq-cai (xtc)

Currently, the only off-chain component that Sonic relies on is the analytics API ( https://api.sonic.ooo/ ). Unfortunately, we have not yet identified a suitable alternative for implementing this feature within the canister.

To ensure a meticulous and extensive evaluation, we will be engaging multiple auditing agencies. Our audit milestone is already outlined in our roadmap, and we plan to conduct the audit post SNS.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-04 17:31:45 UTC | #21

Just gonna leave my thread of concerns & how it was addressed here.

https://twitter.com/accumulatingicp/status/1653794298674946049?s=46&t=p9K9YrK2DF2OD_cPX2QYTA

Seems extremely premature if we can’t even articulate how an evaluation was achieved.

Furthermore, is the dApp to date, not built by a completely different team? Should we not have proof of technical competence, through, for example, an update to the dApp, before setting a precedent of bringing half-cooked dApps to the SNS?

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-04 17:50:48 UTC | #22

As delineated in our previous communication, our valuation methodology for Sonic adhered to established venture capital practices. We are pleased to report that Sonic has achieved noteworthy milestones, as evidenced by the execution of over $10M transactions and the accumulation of over $350,000 in TVL. These metrics underscore Sonic's successful market penetration and the platform's capacity to foster active user engagement.

Sonic's strategic roadmap and overarching vision elucidate the platform's considerable growth potential. Our analysis encompasses a comprehensive assessment of market opportunities, including an estimation of the total addressable market and the potential for capturing a significant market share.

The Sonic team has demonstrated exceptional proficiency in enhancing the platform's value proposition within a condensed timeframe. Notable accomplishments include the integration of an extensive array of token support, the adoption of emergent industry standards, and the forthcoming open-sourcing of the platform. The team's contributions extend beyond Sonic, as evidenced by the successful launch of dApps like Rocket, NFT marketplaces (Meme Cake), and wallet adapters (Artemis) within the ICP ecosystem.

Sonic's affiliation with the Dfinity ecosystem commenced immediately following Dfinity's mainnet launch, and our commitment to development within this ecosystem remains unwavering. We are honored to have received multiple grants from Dfinity, which have facilitated our ongoing efforts to contribute value to the ecosystem.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-04 22:43:16 UTC | #23

In our previous conversation, I had been told;

“Use the VC method. Account for the high risk and potentially high rewards associated with early-stage investments.”

I’ve simply been asking you to show how the evaluation was achieved, using ANY method.


I’d agree those are substantial achievements in both volume, and TVL for our chain, and are the start of metrics needed for an accurate valuation. I’d also agree that you’ve outlined a comprehensive, and ambitious plan. While these are the foundations for a good evaluation, the extrapolation upon the current value, reflects something inaccurate in the shortterm, in my opinion, to investors (growth, population, volume). 

Obviously the two are incomparable as one is one it’s earliest growth stages, while the other is an established DEX, but if we just look at the numbers and stick to your volume evaluation theory , 


Uniswap currently holds a bit over 1% of ETH’s M Cap, as the largest DEX. Uniswap seen 600m Volume within the last 24hrs, and has a M cap of 3B, which is just 5x. 

Sonic has seen 4.5k Volume within the last 24hrs, and has a proclaimed M cap of 15M, which is 3333x.
You’re trying to put Sonic in the exact same position, % wise, as a startup. 


I don’t think your valuation is crazily inaccurate, as it is a startup, and it does have to be priced according to future potential (to a point), as you need funding to build and grow. However it also has to be priced realistically in accordance to its current performance. 
 
Which is why I’m just asking you to show your work as to how this valuation was achieved, rather than just saying “I used the VC method and imagined the numbers”😅


I congratulate the team on making the switch from WICP to ICP, that is a great implementation to remove friction from new traders. With that being said your first hint of acquisition was on February 9th (sonic v2 tweet). It is now May 4th. I don’t think it’s exactly fair to call that a condensed timeframe, as Psychadelic built Sonic within that same timeframe to begin with (announced 11/2021, released 01/2022). Within 4 months, I don’t really consider “adopting industry standards” and “open-sourcing the platform” count as substantial updates in comparison to what your roadmap outlines. 
 

Just trying to ask questions & understand how this is going to be profitable for me as an investor.

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-04 22:52:42 UTC | #24

I thought one needed to open-source before SNS so we can review the code?

It makes it trustless. I know that Kinic is open-source FE and uses CanDB backend.
They have yet to open-source their search canisters but wrote that they will with the SNS config file.

How do we trust that you will open-source it? How do we know it will work with the SNS if it is not open-source 100% before hand.

The risk of open-source: is only copy-cats and thunder-grabbers?

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-05-04 23:26:18 UTC | #25

Yea it should be mandatory to open source code before decentralization sale.

We appreciate your inquiry regarding Sonic's valuation. Allow me to assure you that our valuation is both justifiable and consistent with prevailing industry standards. Sonic's development team possesses extensive experience and expertise, and we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic objectives. 

Sonic's valuation is derived from a multifaceted analysis that considers our current achievements, growth prospects, and strategic roadmap. Key factors informing our valuation include:

1. Market Opportunity: Sonic operates in a dynamic and expanding market. Our valuation reflects the total addressable market and Sonic's potential to become a prominent DeFi player.
2. Traction and Engagement: Sonic's transaction volume and TVL demonstrate strong market traction and user engagement, serving as a foundation for our valuation.
3. Development Roadmap: Sonic's ambitious roadmap outlines future development and expansion plans, which are factored into our valuation.
4. Innovation and Advantage: Sonic's innovative features and commitment to reducing trader friction differentiate us from competitors and contribute to our valuation.
5. Team Expertise: Our valuation considers the Sonic team's experience and ability to execute our strategic objectives.

Moreover - Our progress has been facilitated by the support of over 35 esteemed ICP investors who participated in our previous funding round at the current valuation, thereby enabling us to continue enhancing the platform.

We acknowledge and empathize with your sentiments regarding valuation. As an experienced investor, I have occasionally encountered investment opportunities where the valuation exceeded my comfort threshold. In such instances, I have elected to exercise patience and await a valuation that aligns with my investment criteria before initiating a position. Alternatively, I have employed a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate valuation risk. I would respectfully suggest that you consider adopting a similar approach in evaluating your potential investment in Sonic's SNS.

Lastly, we would like to emphasize the importance of prudent risk management. We encourage all prospective investors to allocate capital judiciously and invest only what they can afford to lose.

Thank you for your interest in Sonic

A good product should not only look at its open source or not, but should pay more attention to its usage experience. I have experienced many projects that were completely open source before IDO, but the product experience sucked and died after IDO.
You mentioned Kinic, you can search for "Internet Computer" in Kinic, then search for the same word in Google and compare. Ask yourself, is the user experience of Kinic good? Even if it's open source.

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-05 05:21:26 UTC | #30

You can say that for any web3 app... 

I can go to an ATM and get out money at any time. Does the NNS app have that feature? Oh. no? So it must not be good by your criteria.

Many of the IC apps have web2 versions. DSCVR = Reddit, Kinic = Google, Twitter = TAGGR.
If I look up TAGGR in Google no results that are relevant to TAGGR app.. If I look it up in Querio (off-chain Kinic) also inaccurate results that do not find TAGGR. The only place that does let me discover the web3 version is Kinic.

It is about making open source things better and better.
Here is a thread from a leak Google email showing that open source AI destroyed their moat for the better of humanity. This is what web3 is about for me.

I am happy for the Sonic team for their upcoming SNS launch but I have a few concerns.
The product has degraded for me as a developer since your takeover from Psychedelic.
Breaking changes happens without notice, your sonic-js library is outdated, broken and I had to patch it locally in order to use it, your customer support takes ages to respond, the TVL has no meaningful increase and the app became noticeably slower in swaps.
I assumed after the takeover you would maintain the same quality of work or increase it but from my experience this wasn't the case. Honestly most of the good things about Sonic is pre the takeover.
I wonder why you are rushing to the SNS sale that quickly before you prove you are capable of maintaining a good product.
Nevertheless good luck with the sale and I hope it makes the product better because sonic is the best user experience in the ecosystem so far.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-05-05 07:55:30 UTC | #32

What do you think is a fair valuation and why? I agree that we need independent investors valuing companies and informing about what if fair. I guess one way is to let the NNS market decide but users should be informed on how it compares to other similar products I suppose. A lot of the concerns you mentioned are valid.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-05-05 08:44:12 UTC | #33

I really appreciate the constructive discussion in this forum thread and I think that it is great that SNS key considerations (components on-chain vs off-chain, open source, voting power/decentralization) are brought up. 

To the list of topics under discussion I would like to add the topic of security reviews. An earlier [SNS forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543) formulated this suggestion

> * In general, it is considered to be best practice to conduct a security review including the fixing of risky findings. Guidance on security best practices is [here ](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/security/).
> * Hence, a project should explain to which extent security reviews are relevant for the dapp and what kind of security reviews have been conducted for the dapp if applicable. 

@memecake Could you kindly elaborate on this? I assume that for a DEX the community might expect a high level of scrutiny ideally before the SNS launch.

-------------------------

pphaolu | 2023-05-05 09:02:11 UTC | #34

Are you serious? Please don't impose Web 3 on a product just for the sake of Web 3. The mass of users don't care about that.

-------------------------

pphaolu | 2023-05-05 09:11:55 UTC | #35

It's great to hear that Sonic is gearing up for the SNS launch. As a newcomer to this community, I am excited to explore the various opportunities that lie ahead.

I noticed that Sonic is shifting towards a synthetic-based trading platform, and I have a question. Will the swap service still be available after the synthetic launch?

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-05 12:34:30 UTC | #38

Thank you for sharing your feedback and concerns about the Sonic platform. We appreciate your candor and would like to provide a comprehensive response to address your concerns point by point.

1. Sonic JS library: Our current priority is to focus on developing products and offerings that add value to our platform and generate long-term revenue. While the Sonic JS library is not our immediate focus, it does not mean that we will not be offering APIs in the future. As we introduce synthetic assets and order books, we will release APIs that connect to these services for market makers and other interested businesses.

2. Performance concerns: When we acquired Sonic, it was built on a single canister architecture and supported only 3-4 tokens. Our team has since expanded support to more than 15 tokens, which initially caused some instability. However, we have made significant architectural changes to rectify these issues, and we are confident that Sonic now offers a competitive, seamless experience for swaps and liquidity provision.

3. SNS: The current market conditions, characterized by generally decreasing cryptocurrency prices, present an opportunity for us to raise funds to improve our platform and stay ahead of our competitors. In contrast, a bull market often leads to rushed investments and compromised quality in the industry. Our decision to pursue an SNS sale now is a strategic move to accelerate the development and growth of our platform. To achieve our vision of reaching $100M TVL and $250M in trades on Sonic, we need to start now. As outlined in our roadmap, we have set ambitious goals and we believe that raising funds is a necessary step towards achieving them. While some may view this as rushing, we see it as a strategic move to accelerate the development and growth of our platform.

We appreciate your support and understanding as we strive to enhance the Sonic platform and maintain its position as the best user experience in the ecosystem. We are committed to addressing concerns, learning from our users, and driving continuous improvement.

Thank you

[/quote]

I hope @memecake has addressed most of your concerns, but I would like to add some technical aspects here (because I believe you are also a developer). We appreciate the efforts of the previous team, but their solution was never optimized to scale with more token pairs. Previously, it was using a `brute-force` or `linear search` approach for token swap routing, which slowed down the performance of both the frontend and backend. We have iterated over the code to optimize it further in production, and we are actively monitoring the performance of these changes in our production app (FE). The stable version of these changes will be merged into future updates of the sonic-js client library.

Hi @bjoernek 

Thank you for raising the important topic of security reviews and best practices.  At Sonic we recognize that security audits are essential for identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities, and they play a crucial role in ensuring the robustness and integrity of our platform. We have planned for thorough security audits to be conducted by reputable third-party security firms with expertise in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) security. These audits will encompass a detailed examination of our smart contracts, protocols, and overall system architecture.

Security audits are an indispensable component of our development roadmap, as they are integral to achieving success in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.

![Screenshot 2023-05-05 at 2.17.25 PM|690x183](upload://dic5pZy3jXtbPIDvCPCoKgwyvFz.jpeg)
(**Link** - https://sonicdex.gitbook.io/sonic-whitepaper/future-of-sonic-roadmap)

Currently, our team is conducting unit testing, end-to-end testing, and long-running test scenarios to ensure code correctness and security.  The team avoids including test and development code in production. We take measures to ensure that production code is free from security risks associated with test and development setups.

We avoid using forked repositories that lack maintenance and use widely adopted, well-reviewed components. Component versions are pinned to prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions. We avoid implementing cryptographic algorithms ourselves and adhere to standards set by organizations such as NIST and IETF. 

We appreciate the trust that our users place in us, and we will continue to prioritize security as we develop and expand our platform.

Let's check the distribution of tokens as well as technology.
Only a small amount of 1% Airdrop (liquidity provision, testnet, Airdrop to Memecake) is allocated, and many enter the team's treasure.

Let's read it together

https://twitter.com/basedgiant_/status/1654461873868222465?s=46&t=LdBE3xfcflJ30MWG8mSSkA

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-06 18:30:48 UTC | #46

Great thread. 

The distribution process has been designed with utmost transparency. With a total supply of 125 million tokens, an initial 1% airdrop demonstrates our commitment to a fair and inclusive allocation. If deemed necessary, we will consider conducting further airdrops after the SNS launch, subject to approval through a DAO vote.

The team has also been allocated a portion of the tokens, which serves a crucial purpose in the project's development. This allocation is intended to facilitate the hiring of new team members, ensuring that we continue to attract top talent. Moreover, these tokens enable us to maintain a dedicated focus on the product's success, driving innovation and growth in the long term.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-05-08 08:24:51 UTC | #47

I think the security audits need to be completed before the SNS. 

There should be non SNS options (like CigDAO) for folks who want to just tokenize with low barriers. 

But to SNS we need to keep the bar high. So yeah, security audits prior to SNS, esp. for defi.

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-05-08 10:54:22 UTC | #48

Appreciate your feedback. We have already explained above how we are tackling this issue currently. 

As some of you may be aware, our team is currently in the process of making significant architectural changes to Sonic. These changes are aimed at enhancing the platform's capabilities, scalability, and overall user experience.

Given the extent of these architectural changes, it would not be efficient or practical to conduct a security audit at this stage. An audit conducted now would be based on the current structures, which are set to be replaced in the near future.

For this reason, we have made the strategic decision to postpone the security audit until the new architecture is finalized. We believe that conducting the audit in tandem with the completion of the architectural changes will provide the most valuable and relevant insights into the platform's security.

We thank our community for their understanding and patience as we work diligently to build a platform that meets the highest standards of security, performance, and usability.

Manu | 2023-05-09 21:06:26 UTC | #49

I just read through https://sonicdex.gitbook.io/sonic-whitepaper/, this is very helpful! 

I have a question about the initial token allocation. Some things are pretty clear to me
* team gets 14.5%
* psychedelic gets 4% for acquisition
* seed investors get 2%
* 22% is sold in the decentralization sale

Now there are left
* trading rewards 25%
* LP rewards 7.5%
* treasury (contributor grants, LP, programs) 16%
* airdrop 1%
* future funding 8%

Who will own those? Is this all going into the treasury controlled by the Sonic SNS? Does that essentially mean that the Sonic SNS will have a treasury of 25% + 7.5% + 16% + 1% + 8% = 57.5% of the supply, and that the further breakdown is mainly to show how you intend for those tokens to be used?

You're right.

A significant portion, precisely 57.5%, of the remaining tokens is allocated to the Treasury.

We would like to clarify DFINITY’s reasoning for abstaining on the SNS-W [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122209) for Sonic.

Before delving into the details, we would like to reiterate the disclaimer mentioned in our [voting standards](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543): The SNS framework is a relatively new concept, and both the community and we possess limited experience in reviewing and voting on actual proposals. As we gather more experience over time, our perspectives and focal points may evolve.

Let's now discuss our actual reasoning. Taking into account our published [voting standards](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543) for SNS launch proposals, we would like to emphasize that the Sonic team has adhered to nearly all criteria, including forum syndication, white paper, open sourcing, and more. We view this as highly positive.

However, we could not fully follow the explanations regarding security reviews. As outlined in the published voting standards, the need for a security review depends on the nature of the decentralized application (dapp). For dapps where exploits could result in significant financial consequences, the industry standard demands a high level of scrutiny. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Sonic, fall into this category. Conversely, for dapps with a lower financial focus, a less stringent standard may be applicable.

Given that a security review is vital information for assessing the security and thus the maturity of a DEX, it would be logical to conduct a security review before launching an SNS. However, the Sonic team intends to perform a security review only after the SNS launch.

In conclusion, while the Sonic team's adherence to most criteria is commendable, the lack of a pre-launch security review raises concerns about the DEX's security.

The community supported the SNS-W proposal for Sonic. Since we generally prefer not to go against the community's direction, as stated in our voting standards, we chose to abstain.

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-05-15 22:21:45 UTC | #55



So far, there have been a lot of rejections, and I'm relieved that the community has made the right decision.DEX with only 1% assignment to the community is the same as CEX.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-05-16 05:25:46 UTC | #56

Wait, what? Did you guys tell tell weeks ago you had reservations about the lack of audits? Why wait until the last minute? You know how much weight Dfinity votes holds and should definitely voiced this concern prior now. 

I have 0 stake in Sonic but I am worried y'all may be pushing builders out of the ecosystem with these mind-blowing decisions. I am definitely feeling less enthusiastic about $ICP than I was yesterday.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-05-16 06:40:44 UTC | #58

They choose to abstain how is that bad?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-05-16 06:40:55 UTC | #59

These concerns have indeed been raised before:

* The voting standards, encompassing remarks on security audits, were published on April 21st.
* On May 3rd, specific concerns were raised about security audits and open sourcing the code for Sonic.
* Furthermore, other community members in this forum thread expressed concerns regarding the absence of security audits before launch, which are especially crucial for a DEX.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-05-16 06:41:42 UTC | #60

How much is it to get a security audit. Maybe this is why we need smaller rounds of funding for many of the other DEX's going online as well.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-05-16 06:52:29 UTC | #61

This is a valid point. Security audits are not inexpensive. While I'm not an expert on the subject, I've seen quotes of at least 20k or more. As a community, we should contemplate how to help DEXs overcome this challenge.

I've heard that other projects are considering bug bounties. This approach might be sufficient initially for dapps with a lesser financial focus.

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-05-16 07:16:17 UTC | #62

I think you should give up SNS in case of a failure due to a funding problem.I look forward to your hard-working vote.

Community allocation is one percent, team treasure is 99 percent

Antony | 2023-05-16 07:47:30 UTC | #63

I am deeply saddened by this decision as I fear it may force skilled developers to leave IC. I am surprised to see barriers being imposed on DeFi platforms, which in turn will be a place of useless social media dapps which will not bring any value into our ecosystem  

After reviewing Sonic's current DAO proposal, I have concerns about the potential for concerted attacks from propaganda teams, leading to loss of confidence in SNS.

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-05-16 08:22:04 UTC | #65

This is incorrect,
When we look into their proposed allocation they have allocated 25% for trading rewards and 7.5% to LP providers. Its a reward system which will helpful to bring more value to platform and beneficial for investors who put money in the platform (Ref: uniswap, pancakeswap, dydx). 

Lets analyze some project approach towards airdrop

Previous SNS project, Open chat allocated 0% for airdrop, very smart plan and good for SNS investors.
Kinic is airdropping 4% against 150 NFT which they have used to raise1500 ICP(160 token/ICP) few months back. They are now proposing a 25% airdrop against 1.5M ICP (at a rate of 1 token/ICP). While this may lead to a lottery for all NFT participants if the hard cap is met, but it could potentially bad for SNS investors.

-------------------------

RMCS | 2023-05-16 08:29:30 UTC | #66

Help me understand this please,
1. People think Dfinity has to much power on network governance.
2. Dfinity decides to abstain (let the community decide), and people are complaining that Dfinity doesn't vote..

That said, i guess i doesn't matter which direction Dfinity moves (vote yes, no or abstain) people will always find reasons to complain.

-------------------------

Wallstreetguy | 2023-05-16 09:25:27 UTC | #67

Nobody is pushing builders away, there was a standard for them to meet they decided to not meet it and continue with the lunch how is that Dfinity fault?. 

If they had done the audit they wone be in this kind of situation, all Dfinity is after is the safety of the network and users, they can always create another SNS proposal but let them do the Right things first

-------------------------

Wallstreetguy | 2023-05-16 09:28:32 UTC | #68

Like!!, its really tiring when Dfinity tired to do something for our own safety, does not seem like people see it at all, why are they in a hurry to start the SNS lunch when they could actually do it after the have completed the security Audit.

-------------------------

Wallstreetguy | 2023-05-16 09:30:14 UTC | #69

Is ICP not supposed to be decentralized?, why are you looking up to Dfinity before you make your own decisions?, Sonic did not meet the Security Audit requirements, how is that Dfinity fault, all Dfinity is trying to do is protect you and me, yet we don't appreciate them for it.

-------------------------

Wallstreetguy | 2023-05-16 09:32:41 UTC | #70

nothing is forcing anyone away, they were not asked or begged to come on the IC in the first place, there are standards to be met, they did not meet it and went ahead to start the SNS proposal, you expect dfinity to still support them?, if they had done the right things we wont be here RN, they did not need to be in a hurry to start their own SNS, atleats meet all requirements first

-------------------------

RMCS | 2023-05-16 09:53:32 UTC | #71

Just to be fully transparent, 

I do understand what they are trying to do, security audits are pretty expensive for small projects. If you can find a company they throw with prices ranging from 20k to 80k for an audit for small to midsize projects. And then you don't even have a company that has knowledge about the IC and its security.

But this triggers a "trust me bro" scenario, where we need to trust the developers that they actually do the audit after they received the funds from the sale. I'm personally not a fan of that approach. 

They could also save some earnings from Sonic, do a crowdfund or apply for a grant to accommodate for these costs (partially).

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-05-16 10:16:43 UTC | #72

Anyway, I will wait for the results of the vote. Hopefully a team with security/technical skills will join the SNS.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-05-16 10:45:26 UTC | #73

It's not bad to abstain but if you're going to do so for security reasons give the project a heads up so they have a chance to fix themselves. If Dfinity has indeed done then I apologize.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-05-16 10:54:52 UTC | #74

Dfinity can do whatever it wants and that's fair. My issue  is how it was done or at least the way it looks to me.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-05-16 11:12:39 UTC | #75

There is more time ahead of us. I don't see the point. It is not like they can't submit again... Plus this is all an experiment. Not saying everything is perfect but def not the end of the world. I am also changing who my neurons follow based on how they vote on diff issues, that is the great part of this experiment.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-05-16 11:28:50 UTC | #76

Some community members pointed out some excessive fees charged during swaps. DFinity has also guided Sonic to rectify some other things. This is DEFI, so we must hold it to a high standard. Wouldnt touch it without a security review, unless with a little gambling money.

Proposal to approve or reject Dump(RUG)

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-05-16 12:18:12 UTC | #79

Yes I think Defi Products should think all things before coming to this otherwise we will kick you out... 
So my suggestion to all developers is to go ahead with some scrap browsers or social media websites and raise 1-2 Million ICP.

-------------------------

Junkfarm | 2023-05-16 15:08:25 UTC | #80

This makes no sense. You'll have to audit all of these projects if this is the case. 
The insider favoritism that goes on at Dfinity is seriously killing any chance you'll have at a successful blockchain. Developers are already leaving and now this will ensure people don't come here at all. I'm completely lost that Dfinity can't ever get out of their own way 😞

-------------------------

Junkfarm | 2023-05-16 15:11:26 UTC | #81

The Sonic team has been working tirelessly for years. Not an experiment to them. Again, developers will not waste their time on experiments.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-16 15:21:10 UTC | #82

I don't think it's necessary to blame the person who refuses, the motivation of the refusal is to use people's money more safely. Even if sonic rejects this time, it can still do the next time. sonic that solves the security problem will jump higher next time, right?

[/quote]

I am making no comment or judgment on Sonic directly, but my general understanding is that SNS was not for small projects to begin with.  If you are going to "go public" you need to be able to hold up to public scrutiny and this likely includes 1. Open Source Code. 2. Professional Audit (or Audits).  3. Established operational trust.

Clearing these bars is not for the faint of heart.  On the bright side, there are many other ways to raise, decentralize, and become operational without going directly to an SNS(In fact I'd argue that going straight to SNS is leaving most of your chips on the table).

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-16 20:05:01 UTC | #87

We have arrived at a point where the decentralised community of the Governance system on the IC, gets to discuss and vote to accept or reject.

It seems that we have extreme polarities of views where we welcome all, FOMO and false information.

This is democracy and the majority rules.

I believe security should be the first issue of entry and this is the moment for all of us to send a message that this is the community standard of entry to the IC for all projects.

If we look out to the real world and the problems of the old Internet security, I find it hard to believe we would want to adopt these failings and send a message to all projects that this is our minimum requirement of entry.

Thank you @RMCS for providing important information that sounds rational and more acceptable as a discussion and encourages fact finding for a better outcome.

Marketing will always show us the polished version but we as a community should look at the known issues, as did DFINITY, to voice our concerns and requirements, after all these projects want our support. If they are not willing to accept our requirements then why should we want to work and support them?

Are they making your point

A "twit" is a term used to describe a foolish, silly, or annoying person. It is often used in a light-hearted or mildly derogatory manner. The word "twit" originated in the English language and has been in use for several decades. It is similar to other terms like "idiot," "fool," or "nitwit" in describing someone's lack of intelligence or common sense.

The people who complain can wake up a bit. The foundation is also responsible for the safety of the community's funds. It's easy for some people on Twitter to follow some people.

AslamVA | 2023-05-17 13:41:38 UTC | #97

I am curious about dfnitys thought process behind their decision. I am sure Sonic team is talking with dfnity for a while regarding the SNS. Was there any discussion regarding the audit before this? If yes, what was Dfinity's take? 

Many community members don't have any understanding of product development or audits, and are parroting the lack of audits on Twitter. 

The whole thing only reduces the credibly of dfnity. Will you guys ever be able to build a thriving ecosystem? 

or shorting $ICP the only way to make some ROI?

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-17 14:23:26 UTC | #98

Why so dramatic about this ? Would you rather people invest ICP as liquidity in a DEX that is not audited and after point fingers when something goes wrong ? How would that help the community ?
Also I am not saying that with audit everything will be ok because it is DeFi after all. Just look at Merlin.

@diegop why do we have to look at all these Twitter posts?  They are impossible to follow yet they stand out more than any other posts in this thread.  They are not even original content (violating the [Post Only Your Own Stuff](https://forum.dfinity.org/faq#stealing) policy).  It's people posting sound bites made by other people from other peoples content...3 levels deep.  I think they are a distraction to meaningful conversation on the forum.  I would vote for minimizing them if they are not original content.  There is no reason why these Twitter post should be on such prominent display relative to other conversation.
