Integrating social logins into dApps could significantly streamline the onboarding process for new users, particularly none crypto ones. 

Are there any technical barriers to implementing it in the creation of an Internet Identity, provided that the user possesses a TPM device?

It worked well with Bioniq.io, and Sonic also plans to implement it.

p.s. Adding it to oc.app would be huge
