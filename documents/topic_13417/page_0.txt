As you may know we are rewriting iteratively the NNS dapp frontend (related [post ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/network-nervous-system-dapp-is-moving-to-svelte/11668) for more details).

Earlier this year, the sign-in screen was the first to be converted and later on - mid April -  all proposals‚Äô features were migrated as well (related [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-dapp-voting-tab-in-svelte-live/12084)).

Today mark another important milestone in the project as the new version of the NNS dapp that has been proposed on mainnet introduces both all accounts' and neurons' features rewritten in Svelte!

Let me know if you have questions or observations and looking forward to your feedback.

One remaining tab to go, "Canisters" we* are coming at you!

*cc my frontend devs colleague @lmuntaner and @mstrasinskis 

***

As already communicated, there are no UI/UX changes at this stage, "it still look the same". However we tried to improve minor things. e.g. displaying a message on screen when you need to interact on your hardware device or improving errors handling. We hope this can be helpful too.

I do have one observation that stands out above all others‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a lot faster.  Well done Dfinity team!  This is already a much better user experience.  Keep up the good work.

Just tried merging some maturity and voted on a couple proposals, it's already night and day difference. One thing that'd make it even better is if the UI wouldn't wait for confirmation after a vote, it takes a couple seconds for the update to achieve consensus and notify the client, if you have to vote on many proposals it gets annoying.

-------------------------

DaveH501 | 2022-06-01 16:12:50 UTC | #4

I‚Äôve experienced problems voting on iPad and iPhone today with the vote screen not following through and registering the vote.

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-06-01 17:23:22 UTC | #5

This is great, thanks!

Only thing, could be the ‚ÄòAge Bonus‚Äô neurons attribute again displayed with three decimal places? :pray:

-------------------------

coin_master | 2022-06-01 17:36:05 UTC | #6

The new pages are a joy to use now.
One thing on Iphone 13 clicking start dissolve button doesn't work and only shows a grey screen, it works on the desktop however.

Edit:
Looks like the voting modal also doesn't work.

Thanks for the feedback, the "night and day difference" makes me really happy üòÉ.

About voting, I am totally agree with you! It currently happens that way because after voting we have to reload information such as the neurons to be sure everything is in sync. I don't have a plan yet but it's definitely somewhere in my mind to take some times to check if we cannot improve the user experience there.

We fixed the issue and the related proposal has been accepted, therefore the issue should be fixed on mainnet too. Let me know if it works for your @coin_master and @DaveH501

Long story short, earlier today I noticed an issue with the proposals filter "Topics" modal on iOS which I fixed in PR [#931](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/931). As you can see in the screenshots provided in the issue, it was indeed fixing it. However later on, as we all noticed, it  effectively did not work in Safari. So lesson learned, when it comes to modal, real Safari !== simulated iOS/Safari in Chrome debugger.

Ultimately the issue was fixed in PR [#939](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/939).

While re-writting the nns-dapp frontend we have so far wrote 1000+ jest tests but we began recently to write e2e tests. In the future, these kind of tests + screenshot comparisons will prevent these kind of misfortune to happen again.

Thanks for the feedback. I discussed with my colleague and we are actually both not sure what you exactly mean with "Age Bonus neurons attribute". Can you send me a screenshot for more details?

Sure, what I mean is the last part of `Voting Power` calculation (under staked `Neuron`) - `ICP Stake` x `Dissolve Delay Bonus` x **`Age Bonus`**:
![image|112x28](upload://uU3z2X5ZQNsD2CwuuOB6LI4wmPq.png)

![image|229x53](upload://tZQTMFZCBHXYLtLy6O7mKX8KTd3.png)

- This used to be displayed with three decimal places and increased approx once per week.
- On screenshot below is visible current `Dissolve Delay Bonus` and `Age Bonus`:
![image|83x22, 100%](upload://omCitqAwWsA5dbtUESnBsP5fLr9.png)

I mean, this is nothing too important, it's just nice to have better overview of the `Age Bonus` when increasing stake or thinking why some `Neuron` gets a bit more/less `Maturity` than others - as bonuses like `1.020` and `1.029` already make some difference.

Thanks!

coin_master | 2022-06-02 07:07:47 UTC | #12

Thanks all works fine now

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-06-02 07:11:18 UTC | #13

Ah gotcha, thanks for the feedback. So indeed we modified it to two decimals because we thought it is more readable, particularly in such a small tool-tip. Worth to notice that the number is rounded so your example `1.029` should - my understanding - be displayed as `1.03`.

If it's ok for you, we would be happy to keep this displayed information rounded to two decimals. Sure if over the time you and other really notice it's a bummer, then we redo it but maybe we can give it a small try. Works for you?

Hey everybody üëã

Small adds-on, we have done some extra hours today and have proposed a couple of improvements that are now deployed on mainnet.

- we have improved the way ICP amounts are shown in the dapp, hoping it makes the values more readable ("two decimals, more decimals when necessary, zero as zero and quote for thousand separators" - PR [#947](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/947) and  [#949](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/949))
- buttons' height on mobile devices should now be aligned ("same height everywhere" - PR [#948](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/948) and [#944](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/944))
- the grey-ish background for cards within the detail of the proposals is back (PR [#935](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/935))

Hope these small adjustments are cool!?!

wpb | 2022-06-02 20:57:27 UTC | #23

I agree with the idea of taking an optimistic approach after a vote is cast and moving immediately back to the proposals display instead of waiting for the new vote tally to display.  We can always revisit the proposal if we want to see the vote totals update.  It would be nice if we don‚Äôt have to wait before we can move to the next proposal.  ‚Ä¶that‚Äôs my $0.02

-------------------------

Nick | 2022-06-02 23:36:05 UTC | #24

@peterparker Now that you‚Äôve rounded off all the account balances, is there any way I can still see the *exact* balance of my account?? That‚Äôs important for accounting purposes.

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2022-06-03 01:59:35 UTC | #25

The exact value is due to be provided as hover text on desktop.  Would that be sufficient and convenient for your purposes?

-------------------------

Nick | 2022-06-03 02:12:32 UTC | #26

For my purposes, yes. But the mobile interface would ideally be at feature parity with the desktop interface. (Most of the Earth's population *only* owns a mobile device.)

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2022-06-03 02:17:02 UTC | #27

For mobile a tooltip is envisioned; press and hold.  Neither solves the problem of copying and pasting the precise value to another app; that will require some design experiments to see what works well.

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-06-03 03:29:10 UTC | #28

Some observations:

1. Spawning a new neuron used to take you to the page of the newly spawned neuron but that no longer happens. This confused me and almost resulted in taking action on the wrong neuron.

1. The number of decimal places/significant digits for ICP used to be higher. I can‚Äôt help but feel that my reporting is either going to be less accurate or involve more work now. This might be more relevant as price increases, especially if there‚Äôs rounding involved.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-06-03 05:18:22 UTC | #29

An optimistic approach was actually our first approach in the rewrite of the "register vote" process but it leads to side effects / issues, that's why we ultimately implemented this conservative approach to avoid problems.

But, again, I am - we  are - totally agree with you. It should be faster. Like I said above, do not have a clear plan about it but count on having a look again. Will keep the community posted.

Count on me to always remember there are no "hover" feature on mobile devices! 

As @bitdivine we might use the tooltip or our UX specialist Mischa will come with a smoother idea.

We implemented the same change in accounts creation - i.e. when accounts are created, users aren't redirected to the detail page anymore. We did that change because we try to give users' feedback either through on screen changes (like a list that is updated) or by using "green" success toasts. I also think it aligns the app to some state of the art as it is quite not common to force-navigate users.

I understand it can be surprising for users that were used to previous behavior, on the other hand feels like the new behavior is more natural for new users.

We should probably have add published a post about that particular change, sorry for that. Works for you if we stick to the new behavior?

As my colleagues said, we are thinking about adding tooltips.

When you say "I can‚Äôt help but feel that my reporting is either going to be less accurate or involve more work now.", did you manually copied some values? can you send me a screenshot of what source of values you used for your reporting?

Knowing what sources you use for your reporting can help us provide a solution that would hopefully still be acceptable for your use case.

Make sure to stake for 8 years with no dissolve to get maximum rewards and age bonus. For every 1,000 ICP staked this way, you get 25 free per month. Do the math and you will see that you get you money back quicly in rewards and keep getting rewards forever.  I never want to dissolve. I just want the rewards.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-06-03 14:41:56 UTC | #34

Thanks everybody for the feedback regarding the "two decimals ICP display". To follow-up we have implemented and proposed today a first improvement that consists of displaying more decimals, if needed, on the "Neurons" tab (PR [#952](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/952)).

General rules are following:

* If ICP is zero then 0 should be displayed - i.e. without decimals
* ICP should be displayed with max. 2 decimals (12.1 ‚Üí 12.10, 12.12353 ‚Üí 12.12, 12.00003 ‚Üí 12.00) except currently for transactions and neurons - if value has more than two decimals - and for ICP value < 0.01
* in such case, ICP should be displayed as "detailed" - i.e. up to 8 decimals without tailing 0s

Hope that does the job for now.

We still plan to improve the usability - e.g. "if 2 decimals are displayed being able to find the 8 value decimals with something like a tooltip" and also looking forward to get some more info about the "reporting" topic @paulyoung explained above.

Have a good weekend everyone ‚òÄÔ∏è

Not really my call üòÑ

It might be nice if the call to action in the green notification was something like ‚ÄúShow‚Äù, where hitting it took you to the new neuron.

I‚Äôd rather not, but it‚Äôs usually the ICP value shown at the top of the neuron screen. It seems to have been changed back to how it was before on the screen.

I noticed it was still rounded on the transaction screen when sending ICP though. It would be great if this was consistent throughout the app.

Following feedback of the community (see above [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-dapp-accounts-and-neurons-tabs-live/13417/34?u=peterparker)) the display of the ICP on neurons pages has been improved on Friday indeed.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-28 09:05:23 UTC | #38

Is there any reason why we can set dissolve delay lower than 6 months when creating a new neuron? It's a bit tedious to use the slider to set delay to 6 months exactly, there are many ways to solve this, a good start would be the set the min value to the minimum timeframe required to receive rewards, I doubt anyone wants to lock tokens for 5 months without any benefits. Dropdowns or a text field would also be nice.
