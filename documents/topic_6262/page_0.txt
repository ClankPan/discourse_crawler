I get this error when I forgot to create a canister in nns app and link it with the canister I would like to deploy.

You can follow that tutorial to create and link canister with nns app: https://medium.com/dfinity/how-to-deploy-your-first-canister-using-the-nns-dapp-c8b75e01a05b

When the canister is created, you need to add the related id at the root of your project in a `canister_ids.json` file.

P.S.: I think you can also do it with the cmd line but never tried.
