The Motoko base library is pretty barebones right now, but I'm surprised I can't find anything in the [Array functions](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/array) that allows for simple deletion like that, either by index or by value. Seems like a fairly obvious oversight. Maybe someone can chime in with a better way, but you could remove an item by filtering the array into a new one:

```
public func remove(array: [Text], value: Text) : [Text] {
    Array.filter(array, func(val: Text) : Bool { value != val });
}
```

Or possibly slicing the array to avoid the item at the desired index, but I'm not sure if array slicing is even possible in Motoko.

Yes, `Array.filter` works, but since array is fixed-length, inserting/deleting an element from an array takes linear time. You can use `Buffer` or `List` from the base library for efficient insertion and deletion.
