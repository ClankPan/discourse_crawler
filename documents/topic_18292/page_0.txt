hi, I was using an Axon at axon.ooo but since Norton disappeared at some point I guess the domain expired possibly.

Anyhow I am trying to find the IC canister that served that website, because i need access to a JSON file that was being created for my Axon which the new forked axon doesn't provide.

I have been able to find that axon.ooo principle may be dslea-eiaaa-aaaae-aaa3a-cai

I've tried looking at the canisters it has on icscan but it doesn't appear any of them have a "URL".

Anyone have any idea how i might be able to find the web address and see if the service is still working?

thanks!!
