So I was trying to upload a 1.3GB zip file to a canister, and serve it via raw url. 
Its getting uploaded fine but when i open its raw url, I am seeing something like this in inspect:network tab :

Which is also fine. But strange part is after all chunks get loaded the url redirects itself to certified url and then certified url keeps relaoding chunks again and again.

I already confirmed .ic-assets.json is working fine to stop raw url redirect by uploading a small zip file, and I can download zip file using raw url simply.
But something strange is happening with big file, so what am i missing?
