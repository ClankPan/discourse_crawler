# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires Mac/Linux/WSL2, Git and Podman on your machine.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout 6d21535b301fee2ad3e8a0e8af2c3f9a3d022111
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/6d21535b301fee2ad3e8a0e8af2c3f9a3d022111/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/guestos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Proposal had to be [resubmitted](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122198) since the original one failed. The reason for failure is another [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/121083) submitted last week that should have updated the unassigned nodes which also failed. Since the unassigned nodes were running too old version, the one that was getting deprecated in the blessing proposal, automated checks rejected the proposal. After unassigned nodes were [successfully updated earlier today](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122124), the [new blessing proposal executed successfully](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122198) as well.
