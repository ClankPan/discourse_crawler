I've never seen someone try that command :slightly_smiling_face: 

Looks like it doesn't work at all. It calls the wrong function on the wallet. [PR to fix it](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3662).

The counterpart to check the name would be `dfx wallet name`, not `dfx wallet addresses`

➜  ~ dfx wallet name --ic
