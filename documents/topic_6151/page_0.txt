**Summary**

Enabling NNS-like governance for dapps and services built on the Internet Computer, to enable community governance.

**Status**  
Discussing

**What you can do to help**

* Ask questions
* Propose ideas


**Key people involved**   

David Ribeiro Alves, Lara Schmid (@lara), @johan 

**Relevant Background** 

The goal is to support devs that want to create their own governance system and tokens on the IC.

To this end, we want to provide a service where, upon submission of a proposal with some parameters, e.g., a token name, the NNS creates a governance and ledger canister for a new token that runs on the IC. This is what we call a service network system (SNS). 
For this, we have to define for example the following things:
* What the output governance and ledger canister look like (learning from experience of our NNS)
* Whether we want to refactor our NNS in this process
* How the SNS and our NNS are related (i.e., does the NNS control all SNSs?)
* How can people verify that the code on a generated SNS is really what is claimed?

Also, we would like to provide a standard for tokens on the IC. To some extent this might overlap with standards that we define for the SNSs (if we want a standard then the SNSs should comply with it), but this is not yet clear.

I've always had a concern with this, that it would become too much of a one-sized-fits-all approach. I don't know what the API will end up looking like, but I hope it isn't too restrictive. I think we need to allow room for many varied types of governance, and not to force all applications down the exact same path as the NNS.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-08-16 22:38:03 UTC | #3

Totally agreed.

For example, some services may want to be tokenized but not decentralized—or at least not initially.

-----

A couple questions:

1) Will SNS mint tokens on behalf of services, i.e. will it create an autonomous token canister?
2) If so, what token standard, e.g. EXT, will SNS use?
3) Can the token supply be inflationary, or must it be fixed?
4) Can the list of canisters to be governed by SNS be expanded over time, or is it a static list?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-08-17 01:16:35 UTC | #5

I suggest that the NNS be able to send a message to the Dapp’s/SNS informing it that there is an issue (if the NNS has been advised) of the following types:

* Operational issue
* Security Issue
* Compliance Issue

The Dapp can elect to reply or ignore.

If it is sufficiently grave issue, the NNS may take unilateral action based on community votes (e.g. to suspend the canister) which has always been the case. However, with an SNS in place for the Dapp, the NNS would inform the SNS that the Dapp has been suspended.

Messages received by the SNS can be processed according to the Dapps own governance model (whatever it may be) and effect changes within the Dapps according to the Dapps own policy.

The SNS should be able to handle a variety issues but also handle compliance issue of the following type:

* terrorist content;
* content that incites violence;
* hate speech;
* non-consensual sharing of intimate images; and
* child sexual exploitation content;
* cyber security issue;
* money laundering
* other criminal activity

The NNS may set reply no later than time on a message.

The SNS may also require a vote occur within the NNS time threshold.

FWIW, I have updated the main description with more info, including the engineers and researchers working on it so they can engage with folks directly on this thread ;)

[/quote]

I don’t understand  “upon submission of a propsoal”? Can’t I just install a governance and ledger canister the normal way, like any other canister, and – voila – have created my own SNS with my own custom token? 

As far as I see, there is nothing that DFINTY “needs” to do to enable this. People can already do it. Of course DFINITY can provide off-the-shelve implementations of a governance and ledger canister, like they are providing cycle wallet and asset canister modules. But that’s “just” convenience – or am I missing something?

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-08-17 20:33:28 UTC | #9

Good question, Joachim. I will let David, Lara, or @johan answer.

I understood this to be a combination of "ease for the developer" ("NNS in a box") so I am not aware of the design intent of why it needs to be a proposal to the NNS. They have much more context.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-08-18 01:20:37 UTC | #10

This is pretty key for DAOs. How does the NNS know , for example, content that incites violence? Is this even knowable? For example, in certain parts of the world, blasphemy does incite violence. Do authorities submit a cease-n-desist order? If so, to where?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-08-18 02:17:36 UTC | #11

I think someone will try to lay an information before their court and try to press their issue.  I have no idea what jurisdiction would apply but someone will argue their position.
An aggrieved person is going to want to make representation to someone to remedy their issue.  I can see pressure being applied on those who can exert influence over the NNS.  We have seen this in other venues whereby someone uses threats of litigation, blocking of finances, etc.  Depending on the nature of the complaint, the representations could be mild or severe, legal or illegal including intimidation, coercion, and even military action.  
I think someone will try to lay an information before their court and try to press their issue..
I do not think the NNS or SNS will resolve the issue of differences of law or clashing of values/ethics/religions/culture.  What to do about a complaint should be up to the respective DAO.  What is needed however is a method for the NNS to say, this is not our issue but rather one for the DAO to resolve and communicate it to the SNS.  The DAO, if it chooses to take action could elect to notify the NNS or not.  Doing so should reduce the pressure on the NNS to take action all of the time.
None of this is mandatory.  A DAO could run without an SNS.  If the NNS becomes involved and there is no SNS, the NNS would have limited actions that it could take.
I have no idea what jurisdiction applies to a Dapp or DAO but somebody is going to take a run at making their view stick if there is money behind the action.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-08-18 07:28:18 UTC | #12

I think I should have been more explicit in my questions. 

Let's use a simple hypothetical example of someone writing an article on denying holocaust in a dapp similar to wordpress governed through DAO. While this article would be personally offensive to me, there's likely not much that I would be able do about it. On the other hand Germany attaches criminal penalties to publicly denying the holocaust and likely classifies it as hate speech. 

(i) where does a complainant (country of Germany)post a complaint in context of a DAO ?
One answer could be that the author of this article is not identifiable. Even in that case, what happens if the country of Germany demands that the article be taken down? Who does it post the demand to?

(ii) how does the DAO even begin to judge the validity of a complaint?
In context of DAO, one could , I suppose,  vote on a proposal to take down the content. But is it even a legitimate proposal? Should every demand be treated equally? What if there are countries that do not restrict public distribution of such articles?

While the DAO might or might not have SNS, we are just punting the question to NNS. NNS will need to go through the same issues.

This seems so basic that I think that I am just missing something.

-------------------------

janosroden | 2021-08-18 08:19:20 UTC | #13

I think you understand correctly, IC cannot be controlled by governments but people. In theory this shouldn't be a problem because governments are elected by people :slight_smile: 

Due to the distributed nature of IC not a single government allowed to decide what content should be removed. However people across countries are able to vote to remove content which against common sense like child porn or something.
This is a good thing if you think about democracy and freedom topics which can't be removed by autoriter governments. 
People of Germany have the option to follow a specific neuron in the related topic, for example their prime minister's. Then they're done, they did their part, voted.

Governments which want to remove content which doesn't match the majority of people of the world's will still can block the entire network like [does with TOR](https://www.quora.com/Can-we-use-Tor-in-China).

-------------------------

northman | 2021-08-18 14:01:47 UTC | #14

Good points you made.  A mechanism to allow voting at the SNS level is important.  Likewise, a method for the NNS to punt the issue to the DAO's SNS would seem useful if nothing but to free the NNS of being stuck in the middle of a item which should be addressed by the DAO.

-------------------------

Hashimoto | 2021-08-23 14:21:21 UTC | #15

I just want to express the hope that Application governance will not be a simple clone of NNS governance (token holder voting liquid democracy) but rather a more abstract system that separates concerns and which can allow applications to experiment with different approaches:

0. Different ways of determining who is involved in governance. (Not necessarily tokens)
1.  Different decision making mechanisms e.g. different types of voting, *Bicameralism* , other decision making methods such as *Futurachy* or *Sortition* and so on.
2. Forkful and non forkful execution of governance decisions. For example if a large minority disagrees with governance decision then that could result in a fork of an application.
3. Delegation of decisions to other governance bodies. (For example moderation and removal of very evil and illegal content might be a shared service.)

We are in the very early stages regarding blockchain governance so I would design for maximum flexibility so that developers can explore the solution space.

Hi all,
I am Lara and, as Diego pointed out in the summary, part of the team that is working on SNSs. 

Thank you very much for all your interesting inputs! 

We are currently catching up with our regular work on NNS, but know that we are reading this thread and we will be both answering and providing updates soon.
So please feel welcome to keep sending questions and suggestions!

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-08-24 04:52:32 UTC | #17

SNS will tremendously aid dapps development.

What is the time line of SNS? On July 28, 2021, Dominic tweeted "Expected in 2-3 months". Should end-of-Nov, 2021 be a reasonable time line to expect?

-------------------------

nicko | 2021-08-26 20:10:38 UTC | #18

Without knowing the details, so at a conceptual level, I think this could be very useful. I am not aware of the advantages of having custom governance and seems to me that having an out-of-the-box solution would save a lot of engineering capacity.

-------------------------

fojo95 | 2021-09-20 21:15:37 UTC | #19

I’m creating an *open internet service* now and the SNS would really be a time saver, not having to write my own governance model. I hope this is not too far away!

-------------------------

Ori | 2021-09-20 21:24:51 UTC | #20

Hi fojo95, There’s a talk coming up in the next few weeks on this, keep an eye on [https://dfinity.org/conversations/](https://dfinity.org/conversations/)

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-09-21 02:58:23 UTC | #21


That's right!

Lara Schmid (Researcher on Models & Verification) will be providing a Community Conversation on the latest for this pproject. 

I will confirm soon, but it is looking **like it will be *next* week**: Week of September 27th.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-09-21 12:07:48 UTC | #22

I think these are great points you make; but, I'm concerned that trying to address all of these before the first release of the SNS might delay deployment. I've heard a few projects express their intent to become open internet services and I'd hate to hold up that progress.

I imagine alot of this flexibility can be added in over time or developers may be able to build/deploy their own governance solutions.

@lara i think folks had some questions on the thread that may be worth addressing in the community conversation.

Other folks:

If you haven’t yet, please add some questions which @lara can prepare for. That would make her life a little easier. Thanks!!

-------------------------

lara | 2021-09-28 23:16:19 UTC | #25

Thanks @diegop. 
Although I haven't had time to respond, I have looked at all the above comments when preparing the slides and hope that my talk will cover and clarify some of the concerns! 

Also looking forward to all the questions that people will ask tomorrow and hope to see many of you there for an interesting discussion!

-------------------------

Sherlocked | 2021-09-29 16:43:16 UTC | #26

It looks like you're going to be able to create fungible tokens that can be distributed to manage the DAO -- my question is will these tokens follow a certain standard? If so, what will the standard be?

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-09-30 04:46:33 UTC | #27

Here is the video of today’s community conversation.

Well done @lara !

https://youtu.be/yeooDUCse70

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-09-30 06:16:54 UTC | #28

Great talk.

I'm hoping we can engage on some of the ideas @lara presented today, and hopefully soon reach a stage where we can all vote on a NNS proposal with a fleshed out SNS design (like with other proposals over the last few weeks). The initial design doesn't have to be perfect, and I expect there to be many modifications to it over time as we learn more about different dapps' use cases.

Points that stood out from today:

* One SNS per dapp
* All SNSs will be managed by the NNS, with new SNSs created via NNS proposal
* SNS includes governance and ledger canisters
* Initial token supply will be 10% liquid and 90% locked in neurons (and will be configurable)
* Initial token distribution is as follows: 25% to developer, 35% to a SNS treasury, and the remaining auctioned off on-chain (the auction will be implemented with the SNS as a turnkey solution; distribution is configurable)
* Auction bidders pay in cycles for SNS tokens (could be ICP as well)
* Token supply can be inflationary
* Multi-canister dapps will be supported
* Initial implementation will reuse NNS code; one benefit is that SNS ledger canisters will get Rosetta API compliance for free
* Alternatives to liquid democracy may be possible? (governance should be configurable)

Personally, I'm really excited about this, and hope it can be prioritized in the coming months. It's something that separates the IC from the rest of the blockchain pack—by a long shot.

-------------------------

BramDelfos | 2021-09-30 11:50:33 UTC | #29

Awesome progress!

My main concern is governance configurability. I'm designing new governance structures for IC projects because the current system has a tendency to create centralized voting power over time. 

Even the NNS itself should eventually adopt a different governance structure if it truly wants to become decentralized. ATM the rich get richer and gain more voting power over time.

I propose to implement a combination of quadratic voting and reputation-based voting. This will ensure good economic incentives and permissionless participation (relative to registered voting), but it will become very difficult to gain centralized power.

-------------------------

janosroden | 2021-09-30 12:14:28 UTC | #30

The design sounds pretty good for default option, of course over time other solutions will pop up.

I understand that the design is in planning phase, but wondering why NNS proposals need to be involved to create SNS? That would result a lot of proposals and honestly I don't really want to vote for every dapp... do it my friend, you and your community will pay the SNS cost, why would I reject your request?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-09-30 13:44:13 UTC | #31

Yes, why is creating an SNS for a canister or set of canisters permissioned by the NNS? Creating a canister and setting the controller is already permissionless, why would effectively setting the controller to a group of token holders be permissioned?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-09-30 13:44:02 UTC | #32

TLDR the current design is too complicated and specific

After watching most of the video, I would like to echo my previous concerns.

The proposed design seems far too specific, enforcing a particular governance scheme on all dapps. What if I don't want staking of my governance tokens? What if I don't want to distribute the initial supply with an on-chain auction? What if I don't want to govern my dapp just like the NNS?

I think a more generalized (and simpler) design should be discussed. We should agree on the absolute minimum set of features that all community-governed dapps would want. Over time extra optional features can be added.

For example, I would think the most basic design would at least have the following characteristics:

* A token distributable to many different principals
* A controller that can be set somehow to all token holders instead of a single principal
* A voting mechanism that allows the code and state of the canister(s) to be updated based on some threshold of positive votes

Does it need to be much more complex than this to start? We just need a basic multi-signature scheme for the controller of canisters. All other features it may be possible to build on top of this very simple base.

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2021-09-30 14:22:14 UTC | #33

This is a good place to start.   It will also allow the more complex elements to find use cases in the community, as we are seeing in the responses here.  Some folks are all in and some want a light weight start.

I like the overall plan and really think this can do well.

-------------------------

link2020 | 2021-09-30 16:29:03 UTC | #34

It is an innovative and forward-looking idea. I'm all for it.
I have a question, do we need  NNS voting to issue tokens?

The SNS is meant to be a "tokenization and decentralization in a box" solution and thus needs to have very specific terms and inner workings. However it is ultimately up to the developer(s) to choose to have their app managed by the SNS.

-------------------------

nomeata | 2021-09-30 19:15:03 UTC | #37

I hope that this box has well-defined _interfaces_, so that maybe we can have a world where different SNS implementations can still be used uniformly by common clients, where applicable. For example many may have different voting and distribution rules, but still want to be ledger-compatible, so that wallets and exchanges will just work. Similarly, I expect that a lot of SNS can share the code and logic that acts on accepted proposals (upgrading canisters, managing cycles…) completely independent of how these proposals are managed. Good factorization of concerns will help the ecosystem here, and probably even makes the “offical” SNS simpler.

Hi Joachim. W.r.t. to the spec design intent here is for the SNS to share code and interfaces with the NNS, to this goal we want to:
- Simplify the NNS's interface, extract a spec of the main methods and how they work. (e.g. what are the types and the expectations/pre-conditions when calling methods on NNS's ledger or the governance canister).
- Refactor NNS specific stuff to it's own APIs/types so that we can have a de-facto interface that we know works, from which we can extract the spec.

With regard to swappable implementations of the different components, the SNSs code, like the NNS  is going to be open source so anyone is free to extract some or all of it to come up with their own solution.

-------------------------

nomeata | 2021-09-30 21:06:25 UTC | #39

Sound good! (Although “it’s open source so anyone can change it” is not quite “it’s modular by design and anyone replacing the voting logic module with a different module can continue to use the other parts unchanged”. But I’ll sit quite and see what has been built before I am too annoying :-))

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-10-01 06:34:45 UTC | #40

On the topic of different governance systems, I just learned about Polkadot's governance [model](https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-polkadots-governance-mechanism-6-key-questions-and-answers-1245b91f9e43) and it's pretty interesting (and something individual dapps may want to implement).

They divide power among three different groups:

* Council
* Technical committee
* Community

They emulate a representative democracy with referenda, as opposed to IC's model of a direct democracy. One thing I like is their explicit inclusion of a technical committee (whose members are voted on by the council, whose members are in turn voted on by the community). It's made up of developers most knowledgeable about the source code, which means they have the power to fast-track proposals like bug fixes and uncontroversial features.

Anyways, it's somewhat tangential to this topic, but I wanted to bring it up due to its surprising sophistication.

I think it is tangential this topic but perhaps relevant to the discussions on blessing binaries and how to create human processes for the review snd contribution of the code. The foundation has project to make the technical side of contributions and visibility easier (99% of the reason that code is visible after NnS proposals pass is purely for technical reasons which are being addressed)… but that does not mean the human side (The notion of committees is a good reasonable one). 

So I’m definitely watching and learning (specially last few months as I work on public roadmap).

-------------------------

MalcolmMurray | 2021-10-09 15:50:18 UTC | #44

Although I'm looking forward to seeing the exploration of many novel governance schemes on the IC, I see a lot of value in starting with a specific  “tokenization and decentralization in a box” solution.

It would also be very helpful if the Dfinity Foundation provided a "Wyoming DAO LLC in a box" starter pack, and even offered the services of a registered agent in Wyoming. This would make it much easier to protect SNS-governed dApps from being deemed unlimited-liability general partnerships, so founders don't have to figure out all the legal stuff themselves.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-10-11 00:42:22 UTC | #45

Great thoughts!

The issue with Wyoming is that the DAO LLCs require naming each agent and listing them with the Secretary of State. You can't be part of the dao anonymously. They may 'fix' this but in the meantime the SNS would need some kind of "require kyc" switch and a way to enforce that.

-------------------------

MalcolmMurray | 2021-10-11 11:34:01 UTC | #46

Are you sure? My understanding is that it's just one registered agent to represent the DAO, which is made up of anonymous token holders.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-10-11 12:12:14 UTC | #47

I could be completely mistaken. I was at the Wyoming Blockchain thing a couple of weeks ago and wandered into a talk by https://twitter.com/mdkaufman307?lang=en where he was discussing this.(I think he helped craft the law). He was discussing deficiencies and things they are trying to fix and unless I got the context wrong the DAO law doesn't override the general LLC requirement that an LLC know who its members are.

-------------------------

namyIC | 2021-10-11 20:44:23 UTC | #48

Would there be a point in enforcing a design of SNS such that an SNS implemented by a dapp stakes a fraction of the dapps' funds in neuron(s) in NNS after financing round from investors/community? Decentralization in terms of voting power in the NNS would then increment naturally over time that way, redistributing voting power such that genesis investors voting power would become "diluted" over time? The staked ICP in neuron(s) in NNS would belong to the DAO, i.e. the community/investors of each dapp.

-------------------------

lara | 2021-10-12 17:13:45 UTC | #49

Hi all!
we are posting here our plan for the SNS feature. You can read the intent behind the SNS feature, the high level design idea, an estimate of the timeline etc.

This draft (updated with your feedback) will then be used in a motion proposal that will be submitted to the NNS roughly in a week to ask the community whether DFINITY should work on the SNS feature. 

Looking forward to your inputs and feedback! 

## Objective

The service nervous systems (SNSs) are an extension of the Network Nervous System (NNS), the open tokenized governance system that controls the Internet Computer blockchain, providing governance for dapps. (We refer to [this article](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-network-nervous-system-governing-the-internet-computer-1d176605d66a) for more background about the NNS.)

SNSs will allow developers to create decentralized, token-based governance systems for their dapps.

## Background

Currently, most dapps that are realised as a set of canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer blockchain are either controlled by some developers or have no controller at all. Both situations are undesirable. In the case where a dapp is controlled by a centralized group of developers, users of the dapp must trust these developers not to stop the service or to upgrade the canister code with some undesirable behaviour (e.g., that favors the developers). In the case where the canister has no controller, it cannot be upgraded at all, even though this might be necessary, for example to fix security bugs or to add new features.

SNSs allow developers to solve this problem by assigning to their dapp a tokenized, open governance system, called the service nervous system (SNS). Anyone can participate in the SNS governance by purchasing SNS tokens and locking them into SNS neurons. The SNS governance will then autonomously control the upgrades and changes of the dapp.

Apart from decentralization, another significant benefit of the SNS is that it tokenizes the dapp. For a dapp that has an assigned SNS, anyone in the world can purchase SNS tokens and thereby contribute

1. to initial funding for the dapp, e.g., to pay for the dapp’s cycles, and
2. submit and vote on governance proposals for that dapp.

The SNS can decide to use tokens to reward early adopters and active users, which will help attract users. Furthermore, those who then possess SNS tokens are motivated to help increase the value of the tokens by attracting even more users, which will have positive network effects that are critical for the success of a dapp.

By participating in governance, developers, users, and other investors can collectively decide what new features should be implemented. As their tokens are locked in SNS neurons, they will be incentivized to vote taking into consideration the future value of SNS tokens and thus vote in the long-term interest of the dapp.

More generally, tokenization enables the introduction of new incentive systems and use cases that have the potential to set apart dapps from traditional applications.

## Proposed design (high-level)

For each dapp that would like to adopt a SNS, there is a separate SNS system.

Similarly to the Network Nervous System (NNS), each SNS contains, among others, a ledger canister and a governance canister. Unlike the NNS, an SNS also has an auction canister that will be used to distribute tokens at the initialization (design ongoing).
Also unlike the NNS canisters, SNS canisters burn cycles.

All SNSs are provided out-of-the box and ready to use by the NNS. That is, the NNS will control the canisters of all SNSs and each SNS instance will control the canisters of the dapp that it has been assigned to.

## Security

Both the design and implementation will be reviewed by DFINITY’s security team.

## Alternatives considered

This feature is still in the design phase. We will discuss different alternatives for the necessary components at a later point in the process.

## Backwards compatibility

This feature mainly introduces new canisters and thus is backwards compatible. Additionally, the NNS governance canister would be extended with new proposal types and the NNS registry canister would have new records to store the SNS configurations. However, these canisters have been designed so that adding new proposals and registry records is backwards compatible.

## Risks

This feature consists of many security critical components that require a thorough design, implementation, and security proofs and reviews. Having many dependencies always comes with the risk that the project might take longer as unforeseen challenges in one of the components are encountered.

## Rollout plan

We already started exploring design options and considerations.

If NNS neuron holders adopt the motion proposal, we will continue designing the different components.

If NNS neuron holders reject, the team will go back to the drawing board.

## Timeline

We expect to be able to start working on this feature in a few weeks. As this is a large feature with several components, we currently expect that it takes 4-6 months to complete.

Thanks for the summary!
I agree with most of the points, but would like to clarify that, since the design is ongoing, it has not been decided which parameters (at initialization and later) are configurable and to what extent. So I would precise some of your "will be configurable" to "might be configurable".

I share your excitement and am looking forward to working on this!

lara | 2021-10-12 17:36:15 UTC | #51

Two reasons come to mind:
1) the NNS will be responsible to upgrade the SNSs (with new, updated features or bug fixes). From this point of view it makes sense that the NNS community agrees to take on the responsibility to maintain a SNS
2) the NNS will have to keep track of all SNSs (for upgrades etc). To do so, one easy solution is to keep track of all SNSs in the NNS registry, which is updated by NNS proposals.

-------------------------

lara | 2021-10-12 17:39:32 UTC | #52

Could you elaborate on what you mean by "issue tokens"? Do you mean to distribute the SNS tokens? And do you refer to the distribution of these tokens in the initialization phase of an SNS or later (when the SNS can use tokens e.g., to pay users with a lot of engagement)?

-------------------------

link2020 | 2021-10-12 18:07:10 UTC | #53

Thank you for your reply.
My questions are:
1) Whether developers need the NNS vote through to use SNS？ Can NNS prevent some people from using SNS?
2) Will SNS charge? How does it charge?
3) Can I use SNS to manage the token ledger without using governance features?
4) What do I need to do if I want to be one of the first developers to use SNS? Or what do you need from us? I can't wait to contribute something to SNS.

lastmjs | 2021-10-12 20:46:43 UTC | #55

I would like to reiterate my concerns with the current design, it seems too rigid and will force all dapps into a needlessly specific form of initial distribution and governance.

> The service nervous systems (SNSs) are an extension of the Network Nervous System (NNS)

Why do the SNSs need to be an extension of the NNS? What benefits does this provide? Why can't each SNS be stand-alone and deployed by developers without having to go through the NNS and be maintained by the NNS?

> Anyone can participate in the SNS governance by purchasing SNS tokens and locking them into SNS neurons.

There is an assumption here that all SNS tokens will be purchased. I don't think that we should assume this is how all SNS tokens will be distributed.

Also, what if we don't want the concept of neurons or staking/locking of tokens? What if it's determined that a dapp can simply be governed by liquid tokens, the voting being just one function of the token? In that case the requirement to lock tokens in neurons would be unnecessary.

> The SNS can decide to use tokens to reward early adopters and active users, which will help attract users. Furthermore, those who then possess SNS tokens are motivated to help increase the value of the tokens by attracting even more users, which will have positive network effects that are critical for the success of a dapp.

This focus on one type of funding mechanism, basically the traditional ICO model or liquidity mining model, I don't think should be emphasized so much. Each dapp should make its own determination. It seems strange for this to be part of the SNS designs. I think this is leading the design in just one direction, and not allowing it to be general enough.

> As their tokens are locked in SNS neurons, they will be incentivized to vote taking into consideration the future value of SNS tokens and thus vote in the long-term interest of the dapp.

This assumes the tokens will actual have a monetary value, I think it's entirely reasonable that some dapps will have tokens that aren't meant to have monetary value. We shouldn't use this assumption since it might not apply to all dapps.

> Unlike the NNS, an SNS also has an auction canister that will be used to distribute tokens at the initialization (design ongoing).

Not all dapps will want an auction to initialize the supply.

> That is, the NNS will control the canisters of all SNSs and each SNS instance will control the canisters of the dapp that it has been assigned to.

Why is the NNS controlling the canisters of all SNSs directly? I mentioned this point above as well, seems better to allow the token holders to directly control the SNS from initial deployment.

> Additionally, the NNS governance canister would be extended with new proposal types and the NNS registry canister would have new records to store the SNS configurations

I would hope that we don't have to ask permission from the NNS to deploy an SNS. Why permission dapps like this?

The design is far too specific, and I think can be greatly simplified and still achieve its purpose.

The NNS is already not the ideal governance mechanism: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tokenomics-proposal-community-consideration/6159

Many of us are trying to figure out ways to improve the NNS, and I think generally speaking we simply do not yet know what the ideal governance mechanism for the Internet Computer is. Trying to take the current NNS governance system and just copy it to all dapps I do not think is the ideal choice right now.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2021-10-12 21:46:27 UTC | #56

Agree with a lot of the points here…I think the developers need to accommodate a large range Dapps and dev teams.

I think there needs to be some sort of standardization for some amateur developers who just want a fun dapp vs a more complex sophisticated dapp which wants to monetize/decentralized the dapp and ensure it’s longevity.

Would be good to set out a list of parameters that should be fixed vs variable so the SNS can be customized within reason for each type of dapp.

Just some quick thoughts on variable:
- quantity of tokens
- initial allocation %
- lockup/voting/reward structure (some people aren’t going to want to lockup tokens for a fun game)
- etc.

Some other thoughts:
- I would love to see these tokens available in some sort of standardized SNS exchange
- Also, agree NNS shouldn’t have to approve a SNS but it probably needs some sort of investment (x amount of ICP) to setup that is also achievable for amateur developers

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-10-12 21:55:31 UTC | #57

FWIW I agree with @lastmjs. Im not a developer but I know that I don’t have to submit a proposal to deploy a canister. AFAIK the NNS can do whatever it wants to an app canister if the community approves of it, so I don’t understand why the extra step is needed to deploy an SNS canister.

Just using Dom’s example of a poor developer sitting in a coffee shop; is that developer expected to submit a proposal and then petition the entire IC community to support their proposal? This may work while Dfinity directs the majority of VP but we will eventually move away from that, right?

-------------------------

tkitchens | 2021-10-12 22:11:30 UTC | #58

Seems having the nns orchestrating provides some protections against unruly sns canisters while also providing a functional update pipeline though I agree current proposal may me a bit too rigid and create a higher barrier of entry for dapp developers. 

I also suspect it would be more difficult to implement completely separately from the nns only to realize later it should have extended the nns and then try to connect it. 

If it’s designed as an extension under current proposal I wonder if the nns could become more of a passive observer of a health sns network in the future?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-10-13 00:24:57 UTC | #59

I am hoping the SNS will be more flexible in the structure of governance tokens/sale thereof.
I see a need for some DAOs to restrict membership to parties belonging to specific class.  For example a DAO on Sports Insurance may involve Coaches, Players,Insurers and Adjusters.  Certain permissions will be granted based on the class of the requestor.  Through a vote, entities could be made part of a particular user class. 
For some DAOs, membership would have to restricted to certain classes based on the local laws.  For example certain professional colleges restrict membership to board certified persons (e.g. Doctors, Dentists, etc.).  It may be undesirable for governance tokens to be sold to the general public in this case.

-------------------------

iBardak | 2021-10-13 11:51:00 UTC | #60

I think it's possible to make the solution easier. Allow the controller to generate SNS Voting Power when blocking Utility tokens of a certain project. Thus, the holders of the project tokens will be able to participate in the voting. This function should be optional, not mandatory

-------------------------

HomerShillson | 2021-10-14 09:37:26 UTC | #61

Good to see so many active devs and users here. Love where this community goes. 

I think that in general, we should try to separate SNS from NNS. At least for DAO governance logic. Like what if one DAO want to deploy its own terms and utilities that are not in favor in NNS? What if we need different setup for a DAO than NNS have? I think having wide range of possibilities will bring developers to experiment and try new things. We cannot just have SNS as extension of NNS for so many reasons. I hope we could make this happen.

Alixthe | 2021-10-14 13:01:55 UTC | #62

Hello everyone. Firstly, thank you @diegop, @lara, @johan and the rest of the Dfinity team for allowing the community to comment on this. 

I have been following this topic ever since Dom's tweets (refer my post [here](https://dscvr.one/post/112255/1-billion-governance-tokens-gts-coming-soon) and this [Dfinity article](https://e2o3r-kaaaa-aaaae-aaakq-cai.raw.ic0.app/)) and more so since the recent Community Conversation which I have summarised [here](https://dscvr.one/post/1008812/__service-nervous-system--key-takeaways-and-comm) for anyone who is short of time to read (and visualise based on an edited version of Lara's slides).

Further, I have gone through and summarised the key issues raised in this forum (a majority of which were by @lastmjs) and during the community conversation as follows:

1. SNS should be **stand-alone** and independent of the NNS
2. SNS design should be more **flexible**
3. SNS tokens should be **held in Principal IDs** (not SNS ledger)
4. SNS formation **without having formal proposals** to NNS
5. SNS should be able to **control dApps with multiple canisters progressively** over time
6. SNS to **hold ICP/BTC/ETH (and/or even NFTs)** in addition to SNS tokens?
7. SNS to allow **upgrades to SNS that diverge** from NNS upgrades

I have also expanded each of the above in the form of a [table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsRttCuV9-LGARZbm7dj0rW7lnhLtns_Dl8LYrSEedg/edit?usp=sharing) based on the various comments here (and in the recent community conversations) together with the case ***for*** and ***against*** each of the above suggestions. I have included some basic comments (based on what has been discussed here) for anyone here to expand directly within the table and/or directly in this forum. Hopefully this will allow the community to have a clear understanding of the merits and/or drawbacks of each suggestion raised to allow the Dfinity team to formulate a suitable plan forward for the community.

The following is a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQJszjIQXBM0XP6RbO1vBir_QsJOgW1u_aC_ozHDnNd-XG6VqdKZOWtHTUOof5MV0pHOy8IkKQ_AFZC/pub) to the published table (clean view) for reference.

Hope this will be useful for everyone 🙏

Ahoy folks,

We have been reading and thinking a lot about the feedback from the forum, so @lara @dralves and I have decided on the following next steps:

1. Slow down, take the next few days to take in the feedback, make sure we grok feedback, questions, intent, etc... This may mean you will see us *answering* fewer questions next few days, but we are certainly actively reading and discussing. We will also share the feedback with the wider org to make sure they see it as well.

2. We will delay the NNS motion proposal to vote. We do not think we have truly appreciated feedback so we will delay the NNS motion proposal we were expecting for next week. This is not unusual, of course, we did a similar thing with Threshold ECDSA and one of the results from stopping to listen was that we spun out a project on [sandboxing led by Helge](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/security-sandboxing-community-consideration/7438).

Hello everyone. We want to express the hope that for-profit and non-profit will work with different specifications and that both will work.
1. Public dapps will be run by token governance.
2. Corporate or individual dapps can be run centrally. Or only limited number of people can purchase governance tokens. We want to be flexible.
3. AI censors the data. Operated by a foundation or a community.

lastmjs | 2021-10-15 04:52:32 UTC | #67

So I've been building a simple SNS that doesn't require changes to the IC protocols, just as an experiment and hopefully it will be useful to projects wanting something like the SNS before it comes out. Nothing crazy, WIP, but here's the code: https://github.com/lastmjs/simple-sns

As I've been building this, an interesting nuance has surfaced. It would be nice for the SNS to allow any token (including NFTs) to be specified as the governance token. Why should every dapp have to issue a new token entirely?

What if I want ICP holders to be able to govern my dapp? Or HZLD holders? Or Cronics hodlers? What  If I want to start out with Cronics holders, and then allow the community to vote and switch to another NFT to govern from there on?

It would be nice to allow the SNS to choose an already-existing token as the governance token, in addition to minting a new token (as an option).

-------------------------

Alixthe | 2021-10-16 00:40:26 UTC | #68

Hey thanks @dralves appreciate the feedback 🙏

-------------------------

Malefizer | 2021-10-16 07:01:58 UTC | #69

Reading through the design proposals I'm glad that @lastmjs addresses the elephant in the room. A complicated and opinionated feature is implemented what instead should be something allowed for the free market of dapp developers to figure out. Imagine such a proposal as an Ethereum EIP. Unthinkable! In fact it is somewhat alarming that permissionless innovation seems not a core value of the dfinity team.

Make it a library not a core feature at least.

-------------------------

gravitas | 2021-10-19 07:48:42 UTC | #70

3) I believe the supply will be inflationary because of the staking of such token. However, change is possible but don't know the pros and cons of extending that from the original design of the NNS.

-------------------------

gravitas | 2021-10-19 07:53:43 UTC | #71

Should the NNS have complete power over every SNS?

-------------------------

gravitas | 2021-10-19 07:55:00 UTC | #72

I think the NNS should have more power over time. I don't think the distribution of power is where it needs to be right now.

-------------------------

gravitas | 2021-10-19 08:02:49 UTC | #73

It assumes the community of the SNS is a small percentage of the NNS. The NNS will have verified neurons so it will be more distributed and tied to real people. Whereby, the SNS might be a restricted community for example alt right Trump supporters. Should the NNS have power to take them down. What if the SNS votes to keep the content. Should the global community of NNS take them down?

-------------------------

gravitas | 2021-10-19 08:09:03 UTC | #74

Going rogue. Depends on how the minting of tokens is done. But I am guessing it is possible. The NNS might keep track of the tokens though to stop clone tokens.

-------------------------

gravitas | 2021-10-19 08:20:40 UTC | #75

Going with the standard template for token distribution presented in the video, can we have a set amount of tokens from action reserved for verified neurons. Also setting a max amount limit for purchase, during each phase. There can be many different types of phases that can be chosen. 

The other question people have mentioned is if the initial projects owners can choose to do it their own way? And if so, that project would be open to more scrutiny.  However, should that be a right?

-------------------------

lara | 2021-10-22 19:10:09 UTC | #76

Hi everyone,

As Diego mentioned above, we have been quiet in the forum the last few days working on internalizing the feedback and listening. 

So I want to give you all a quick end of week update.

The main update is that we heard folks feedback on configurable parameters. We have therefore been actively discussing which parameters should be configurable in the SNS at what stages of the project (during initialization vs. later) and to what extent. We will have an update soon which we think most folks would like. 

Regarding other pieces of feedback, we also plan to provide an update this coming week.

I'm wondering if you could also shed some light into the token standard(s) SNS will eventually support. That would make it much easier for developers to plan.

-------------------------

Hi, Lara and the team
Please do help us confirm whether SNS will help the community unify a fungible token standard.
After the canisters can store ICP, whether can they also store tokens SNS issued?
Thank you very much.

Alixthe | 2021-10-28 03:39:45 UTC | #80

Hi Lara ~ thanks for the update and all yours (and the Dfinity team's) hard work in building the NNS and formulating a plan for the SNS.  In this regard, I recently watched the Wanxiang Roundtable with Dom, Vitalik and Juan where they discussed various topics.  From what I gather from Dom's comments, it appears that the tokenisation of dApps via auctions will play a big role in the SNS and as such, I am wondering if this will be a permanent feature of the SNS for all dApps and/or if this is one of the configurable parameters that the Dfinity team is currently discussing. Thanks.

-------------------------

saikatdas0790 | 2021-10-29 09:08:06 UTC | #81

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-10-29 18:59:34 UTC | #82

Hi all,

New week, new update!

We had some time to process your messages and even had the pleasure to talk to some of you to go deeper into the feedback.

Thank you all very much for taking the time to formulate your concerns and provide us with feedback!

## Main takeaway

The main feedback seems to be that the current design is overly-complex and restrictive, as some developers might not, for example, want an auction to initialize their SNS. Moreover, for many, the highest priority seems to be a governance system.

While we still think that the originally proposed design is one possible way to provide an SNS “out of the box” from the NNS, we acknowledge that developers want more flexibility and might only want to use some of the SNS components (i.e., not the “full box”).

Therefore, the current thinking is to revise the SNS design & implementation and to aim at starting with a more minimal SNS consisting of a governance and ledger canister.

Other features, such as the auction, will be rolled out at a later stage and in a very modular way. This would allow those developers that only want a governance and/or ledger canister to already use them.

## Larger context

We also briefly want to mention that there is another NNS-related project that will allow neurons to become so-called “[community fund neurons](https://medium.com/dfinity/how-dapp-developers-placing-their-faith-in-total-decentralization-will-inherit-the-world-79419a3e36c9)” and contribute their staked ICP tokens to a community fund that can then be invested. While the efforts related to this project are tracked separately, we will of course ensure that the designs are compatible such that investing in SNSs is possible.

## What are the next steps?

First, we will go back to the drawing board. For example, we have to think about what a **minimal** governance system should include and we will reconsider whether it makes sense to refactor the NNS canisters and repurpose them for the SNS or whether implementing the SNS canisters from scratch would be more effective (classic software engineering practical decision: *refactor* or *recreate*)

## What happens to the 1-pager serving [as draft motion proposal above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/service-nervous-system-governance-for-dapps/6151/49?u=diegop)?

The idea is that, once we have sufficient clarity on what a new design could look like, we will share a new draft for a motion proposal that replaces the one above.

We look forward to hearing your thoughts and wish you all a happy weekend!

## Addendum

PS a small personal note: @lara  will be out the next week or so @dralves , @jwiegley , and I be covering for her on the community forums. Please be patient as three dudes try to cover *one half* of Lara.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-10-30 03:43:32 UTC | #83

Thanks for the update. Very exciting stuff.

I'm a little hesitant about the SNS ledger canister copying the NNS ledger canister, because I don't fully understand the decisions made about the NNS ledger canister interface.

For example, why is `notify` [separated](https://ic.rocks/principal/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai) out from `send`?

In [ERC-677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677), for example, a single `transferAndCall` function updates the balances and notifies the recipient in a single atomic transaction. The ICP ledger canister split this into two functions, which means that the responsibility of combining both into a single atomic transaction lies with the caller. I'm not sure it's safe to trust DeFi canister developers to correctly implement transactional semantics; if it's possible to encapsulate this into a single `sendAndCall` or `transferAndCall` update, that would be safer as well as easier to use IMO.

-----

And in terms of governance, it took me a couple of days to really grasp neurons, dissolve delay, age, etc. If we really intend for SNS-owned dapps to go mainstream one day, I think the IC's governance model is way too complicated for the average user to understand (or to bother understanding).

-----

I would rather we take our time with SNS to get it right. There are a couple DEX projects building their own token standard. Working together with them on a really good token standard would pay big dividends. Personally, I doubt any IC project really needs SNS at this very moment; what they probably do need (or at least I do) is a working token standard with working rudimentary DeFi plumbing. SNS would be a natural next step after that.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-10-30 06:41:41 UTC | #84

"Personally, I doubt any IC project really needs SNS at this very moment"

That is what I was thinking till I read this article by Dominic ( https://link.medium.com/K6sLTRRLLkb). I spent a few hours digesting all the things in the article.

One excerpt "Very possibly, by January 2022, when the SNS functionality goes live, the funds the NNS has available to contribute will exceed 1 billion dollars in value. Watch for news: the NNS is due to start collecting funds imminently."

If the features of the SNS as his vision in the article are coming through by January, 2022 including community funded neurons, then i would think that most projects would completely wait for the SNS. 

Not sure how this vision , which is SO exciting, will match up against the reality of the time pressures. But regardless let's move on with SNS.

-------------------------

MalcolmMurray | 2021-10-30 12:54:07 UTC | #85

I really like the idea of making ICP tokens locked in NNS neurons liquid for the purpose of buying project tokens that are (mostly) locked in SNS neurons instead. Brilliant!

But what I don't understand is: Why pool these into a fund and allocate them to specific projects using majority-rules liquid democracy? Why not just let each owner decide which projects they want to invest in themselves?

-------------------------

[/quote]

That is a very reasonable response. To be honest, @dralves is weighing a few things (common in software engineering):

* he knows there are unobvious lessons and patterns in current ledger canister that they don’t want to re-learn painfully 
* he also knows how he would refactor the NNS and the ledger canister given what he has learned the last few months 
* he also wants to move fast 

He and @jwiegley are analyzing their reuse or refactor options by looking at the code.

This reminds me of the classic story of when the iPhone was built. The apple team had two choices for iOS: take the MacBook OS and shrink it, or take the iPod OS and grow it. I believe the winning one was the “grow the iPod OS” (from what I recall, I could be very wrong), but it was a non obvious outcome.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-10-30 16:31:45 UTC | #87

"idea of making ICP tokens locked in NNS neurons liquid
"
Based on my limited understanding,  these would be new neurons that are not locked that would be supplying the "liquidity".


"Why not just let each owner decide which projects they want to invest in themselves?"

Again based on my limited understanding, individual owners of new neurons would decide how much slice of the neuron (i.e. ICP) would go into each project.

@diegop can you please chime in if above assertions are not accurate?

Also the consequences of this to the design of the SNS project are also manifest. I am not sure whether the ledger canister code can be effectively "copied" or a whole redesign/rethink is required.

jwiegley | 2021-11-05 00:26:42 UTC | #92

Hi all,

Update time...

Last week Lara mentioned our meeting with community developers, and that we had shifted to a reduced scope in our thinking about what the first iteration of the SNS should look like.

Since that decision, David and I have met a few times on how to approach this redesign: which parts of the NNS do or don’t need to be implemented in the SNS right now; and how we might refactor the code to allow a more flexible approach to things like reward calculation and voting, since some projects may wish to create different incentive structures or different market opportunities within their own communities.

As with any redesign, these are only the first steps, but we do want to get the SNS off the ground quickly, so our initial effort will seek to reuse as much existing NNS functionality as possible, while omitting details that clearly do not apply. But while this is focused more on the low-level details, we’ll be sure to keep you up to date as we discover what makes an SNS truly portable among projects, and how it might differ from the NNS.

-------------------------

In the meantime, a slick video (https://youtu.be/If01WplfnnY) on Achievement Unblocked from DFINITY & United Esports, mentions SNS by indirect reference at around 16 seconds into the video("soon over 1 billion dollars in additional funding")

Exciting times, to be sure!!

Please add a feature to the SNS where a User can set a Commission Rate (%) where if a Vote is Delegated to that user that that user earns a commission on the voting rewards. This is a common practice in delegation for many existing web3 apps and would be useful to have it prebuilt as part of the SNS.

It's used in Delegated Proof of Stake, but is it used for governance?

I'm not sure we should charge a fee for liquid democracy.

The reason they charge in DPoS is because delegators vote for the delegate; without their support, the delegate might not even be elected as a validator.

Here, having people follow your vote doesn't directly benefit you in the same way IMO.

Here's my use case for why I would pay to follow a specific neuron. I sincerely believe that IC will, one day, become the "world computer" on which vast majority of software will be executed.(i.e. I have drunk Dominic's kool aid).

In that context, because I stay in a specific country, I don't want run foul of that country's laws (blasphemy,  anti-hate etc). So if someone else is doing the research on all the issues that might be potentially illegal in my country and voting so as not to run foul of the law, then I would follow that neuron. Obviously it takes time and money to do that research and I am willing to pay for it.

If Join Community Fund can get additional rewards, this will incentivize more people to participate in pledging and neurons become newly liquid while increasing governance and decentralization, am I understanding this right?

I wish that, someone from dfinity, who really knows, posts an update on the inner workings. Absent that post, here a brief CONJECTURE based on my interpretation of the medium article.

According to this medium article (https://medium.com/dfinity/how-dapp-developers-placing-their-faith-in-total-decentralization-will-inherit-the-world-79419a3e36c9), a Dapp run with SNS (due Q1, 2022) governance can run a decentralized auction for a significant fraction of it's preminted tokens. Only "community fund neurons" can vote on and contribute a part of the ICP stake in that neuron to that auction. 

Then , assuming that the vote passes for the auction, the neuron gets the tokens associated with the Dapp in exchange of ICP  staked in proportion to the total ICP staked for the Dapp token auction by all community fund neurons participating in that auction. (if this sounds like a mouthful, it is). This exchange is immediate according to the linked article.

Delegated Proof of Stake is a form of governance (even though typically it is just allocating to block producers). There are several applications where the delegation functionality is used in more advanced ways (e.g. The Graph). I am aware of a project that highly values timely engagement on voting for DAO decisions. For this project, once a threshold of votes are met the proposal is finalized. 

There is no requirement to charge a fee. 

Also, @lastmjs called out that some type of reward might be a useful strategy for increasing decentralization of active voters. By rewarding voters for their time, there is more of a reason for individuals/team to review every proposal in a timely manner and be vocal about why a decision is good or bad. It is not a silver bullet, but it could be combined with logarithmic returns to encourage delegators to either be active or find under supported active voters.

Building it as a functionality, expands the out of the box uses of the SNS which will speed up development on the IC.

What if there were a decentralized Git commit strategy. Shouldn't informed voters who thoroughly reviewed the code be rewarded? What if they cannot afford to put up a large stake? Is their contribution less valuable?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-11-08 22:15:33 UTC | #101

Interesting point about decentralized Git commits.

That's true, not everyone has the time or expertise to vote on code changes, and it wouldn't be great from a democracy POV to reward only programmers and engineers (or worse, non-technical people voting randomly just to collect rewards).

I'm just not sure a commission rate is the right way to delegate. For example, what if I don't want to share 2% of my voting rewards to people who delegate their vote to me? It's not like I get anything out of it (besides having a bigger say over the end result).

It works in the real world, e.g. Congress, because if you delegate your vote to me (i.e. elect me to Congress), then I get a paying job with benefits. I think that incentive structure is currently missing in IC governance. Needs more work I think.

Hi all, 
happy to provide you with a new end-of-the-week update.

We have spent some time thinking about Open Governance / SNS and how this fits into the bigger context of providing the community with tools for tokenisation, decentralisation, access to funding etc. 

Therefore, rather than going into SNS details, I want to share our current view of how these things could fit together and in what stages we could tackle them:

1. **Ledger canister**: A ledger canister, including Rosetta-integration. Currently we think the design might be similar to the NNS ledger, but we want to improve it a bit with the lessons that we already learned during the last months. This effort is lead by @bogwar

2. **Open Governance**: Canister(s) implementing an open governance system. As with the ledger, rather than just reusing the NNS governance canister, we are considering alternative designs that omit some of the NNS governance canister's complexity due to NNS specifics. We also think about how we can make the governance modular so that it is easier for developers to change / (re-) use just some parts. 

3. **Service Nervous System (SNS)**: An out of the box version of the SNS. The current idea is that, in addition to the above ledger and governance canister, further functionality would be provided such as automatic upgrades of the SNS canisters by the NNS and integrated means for a decentralised initial token distribution (e.g., the "auction" that was included in the SNS community conversation). 

4. **Community funds / community neurons**: A mechanism to invest the staked ICP tokens from the NNS neurons in SNS projects and thereby enable even more funding for SNS projects.

We are currently focusing on detailing the designs for 1. and 2. and plan to have concrete design proposals for them roughly in the next 2 weeks.

As you may be aware the community fund button been introduced on NNS dapp IN PRODUCTION AS AN IRREVERSIBLE CHANGE. 

The community has been patient in waiting for an answer here(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-fund-on-nns/8390/16) on what exactly is this functionality (at the detailed level)

Would it be fair to say that , on (4) (community funds/community neurons), depends ( both what it is supposed to do at a detailed level and how to do what it is supposed to do) on 1, 2 & 3?

If so , we will need to wait for weeks to figure this out?

-------------------------

kmanxhuka | 2021-11-27 15:00:51 UTC | #104

Will there be any chances to revert the community fund participation for those who may have clicked accidentally on the button on early stages?
Also, if this is an irreversible decision, there should be a more complex way to confirm the participation on this fund, because this means that the neuron is lost forever. Some way of doing this, could be: before the final confirmation click, for the button to be active, the user should write the word confirm on a text field. I'm saying this because there are many scenarios that things could go wrong:
- the user could leave the wallet open for some minutes, where a child could mess with it and activate the "community fund" function;
- touching the button while being unaware, in the pocket, while driving, while speaking to someone, while dozing away etc.

I think this is the mos critical button in the NNS app, at therefore it should have a more complex activating mechanism.

If someone may say that how could something like this happen, I assure you that it could happen, as it did to me, while being tired I tried to merge maturity and while dozing away ended up touching the "community fund" button, and my biggest neuron went to the community fund.

Hi there, thank you for your patience!
While the implementation and realisation of the community neurons depend on the SNS work, we can work on the design of the two projects simultaneously. In fact, we want to do this simultaneously to ensure that in the end all the APIs fit together. As soon as we have a better understanding, we will share our proposed design with the community as usual.
