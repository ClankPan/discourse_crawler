Thank you for this question and for your detailed suggestions!

We do plan to make a better warning / confirmation mechanism so that users are less likely to enable this feature by accident. 

Also, those who committed to the community fund now will be able to revert this. Once the feature is out reverting the decision might not be possible anymore, but we will try to ensure that anyone who accidentally pressed the button has the chance to take this back in time.

Thanks, Lara.

Comments such as : 
/// Join the Internet Computer's community fund **with this neuron's entire stake**. Caution: this operation is not reversible.

in code [https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/src/commands/neuron_manage.rs]

makes everyone nervous as what this mysterious functionality is.

thanks, I'm looking forward for this, so everyone who uses the NNS and IC feels comfortable using it

Yes, I agree that this is an important goal.

Hi Lara,
Iâ€™m very interested in how I can undo the join community transaction. Today I clicked on merge maturity and then I confirmed it, but after then my screen became white and I saw nothing. When the page was reloaded I saw an option where I could confirm something. I thought this was the confirm button of the merge maturity, but afterwards I realized it was the join community fund option. What can I do to unjoin the community fund? I am very unhappy with this situation, because I want to stake ICP in stead of joining the community fund. I really hope you can help me.

Hi @bert45, 
thanks for your question.
Firstly, "joining the community fund" does not yet do anything other than setting a flag in the neuron. That is, your ICP utility tokens are staked in a neuron with which you can do anything you could do with any other neuron. 
Currently, there is no way to undo this action, i.e., to unset this flag. 
However, we plan to give the users a functionality and enough time to undo this before we introduce the community funds and this flag will actually have an effect.
I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have remaining questions!

Hi all,
this is just to confirm that we are still actively working on different SNS features behind the scenes!
Concretely, we should have a design for an **open governance canister** ready to share with you next week (stage 2. in the above mentioned outline).
I will probably open a new forum thread to discuss this design so we can have a more focused discussion, but I will make sure to link to it from here.

Looking forward to sharing the design with you next week and getting your inputs.
In the meantime, I wish you all a happy weekend!

Glad to hear that! It's really fantastic to see the progress that you are doing. What do you think is a healthy estimate to launch SNS with full functionality? Q2?

Wish you happy weekend too!

Thanks!

It is rather hard to give a good estimate about this for at least the following two reasons:
* First, it is not fully clear to me what should be considered the "fully functional SNS", as I expect the feature to keep evolving and different people might consider different versions as "fully functional" in the sense that all their needs are covered. 
* Second, the expected delivery time also depends on a lot of factors outside the project. For example, if the community decides in one month that some other feature (that we don't know of yet) is a lot more important and we should allocate many of the engineers to this new features, this could mean that less engineers can work on the SNS. So in the end when it can be delivered depends on the overall prioritisation and the availability of engineers.

That being said, with the current information I think Q2 can be realistic for something that can be considered a "full SNS", but for the above reasons this is still a bit hard to predict.

Hi all,
as promised I shared a new proposed design for the open governance canister on a new forum topic [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224).
Looking forward to your inputs and questions there!

-------------------------

Hi all, 

the motion proposal suggesting a first SNS governance canister is live (see [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224/12))!

lara | 2022-02-10 22:42:18 UTC | #117

Hi all, if you are following along the SNS project, please head over to [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-deployment-and-upgrades-design-proposal/10816) to find the new design proposal for how SNSs can be deployed and upgraded.
Looking forward to your questions and feedback!

Jacobs.ic | 2022-03-27 21:07:21 UTC | #118

When this reverting option wil be available? 
And how people wil get notified exactly?
Also is there a deadline for it, to undo this?

Friendly regards,

Jacobs

We are currently working on how the community fund works and estimate that it will become active earliest in Q3 of 2022.
As already promised, if you have accidentally activated the flag, there will be a time period where you can revert this choice. Note however that currently having set the flag does not have any effect on your neuron: you can vote and get rewards as with any other neuron.

So to address your specific question: I am not sure yet when exactly the decision can be reverted and how the process will look exactly. As the actual change is still a bit away there is still enough time to define this and allow users to make this change.

I am also happy to share that @bjoernek will lead this feature going forward!
So he will probably be the person sharing future updates and the best person to answer further questions!

Please find the new proposed timeline for the SNSs [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-service-nervous-system-timeline/11963). Looking forward to your feedback!
