@ICPSwap is there any possibility on your side that a bug could lead to the wallet becoming decoupled from the principal? For example if he used the 4/ one.

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-01-25 12:58:44 UTC | #109

1/ The URL was used in May 2022, but according to dashboard records, the wallet address with ChauDoan's friend seems to have been created around October 2023.

2/ As mentioned by Frederik, we have used the custom domains feature, and the domain pointed to, app.icpswap.com, has not changed. We conducted tests, and using Internet Identity Connecting does not alter the Principal.

-------------------------

frederikrothenberger | 2024-01-25 13:28:16 UTC | #110

Thanks @ICPSwap for providing additional information. So it seems this is a dead end.

>We thought that their friend either made a mistake in backing up the mnemonic phrase or created a new Internet Identity.

This sentence however caught my eye (from [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sos-critical-problem-with-icpswap/25876/4?u=frederikrothenberger))

@ChauDoan21165: There exists an archive for Internet Identity [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/uc7f6-kaaaa-aaaaq-qaaaa-cai). This archive does not hold information about the principals or the dapps that you signed into. However, what it _does_ hold is information about all changes made to any identity (on Internet Identity itself). Could you please verify that the Identity your friend is using is indeed older than October 2023.

To do so, please fill in the identity number of your friends internet identity [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/uc7f6-kaaaa-aaaaq-qaaaa-cai#get_anchor_entries) press call and then look at the timestamp of the first entry.

If you are willing to share the identity number with the me (privately!) I can also assist you in digging through the archive for information (the interface is unfortunately very bare-bones and technical). Sharing the identity number does _not_ give access to the identity but weakens its privacy.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-26 13:10:04 UTC | #111

I created only one Internet Identity for my friend in October 2023. She has been using that for few months. It is impossible to make any mistake. That number always appear when you log in ICPSwap. 
I can share that number with you. How do I do that?  
Thank you!

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-26 13:13:46 UTC | #112

Ok, I just sent you the II number by message. 
Thank you!

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-26 13:20:29 UTC | #113

"We thought that their friend either made a mistake in backing up the mnemonic phrase or created a new Internet Identity."  I already explained but just want to point out once more: 

1. Backing up the mnemonic phrase: We took the screen shot, that have date on it. Impossible to make any mistake here. If you put in the wrong mnemonic phrase, what will happen? 
2. We have been using that II for few months. That II number always appears on phone screen. For no reason, we need to create another II.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-26 13:43:24 UTC | #114

We check the screen shot. On September 20/ 2023 we created that II and start transfering icp from Binance to ICPSwap wallet.

-------------------------

frederikrothenberger | 2024-01-26 14:18:41 UTC | #115

@ChauDoan21165: Thank you for providing the II number. I'm just trying to verify all the information that we have to find out where things could have gone wrong.

I can confirm that this identity was indeed created on September 20 2023.

Just FYI: I'm on PTO next week. I'll look further into this case when I'm back. Thanks for the patience.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-26 15:15:26 UTC | #116

Thank you. Your help is much appreciated!

Hello, first question: When you found that you couldn't log in on the usual device, did a dialog box pop up prompting you about the error causing the login issue? Second question: After logging in on the new device using the 24-word mnemonic phrase, did the NNS wallet ID change? Third question: Did your friend share the 24-word mnemonic phrase of their NNS wallet with you?

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-03 15:13:13 UTC | #118

1. Just spinning. I was sitting next to her, I thought the system is down, but my account still fine. 
2. She never use NNS wallet. Just transfer from Binance to ICPSwapp address. 
3. I helped her to created the Internet Identity, told her to keep it. For no reason she has to share the phrases with me. 
Thank you for your attention!

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-05 14:38:04 UTC | #119

We are in a weaker position than ICPSwap, we may not understand the technical aspects like they do, we don't have persuasive evidence, but our money is lost and we will persist in speaking the truth.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-02-05 16:27:30 UTC | #120

I still somewhat believe that my hypothesis regarding the use of different URLs/links to access ICPSwap could be the root cause of the issue.

We confirmed that none of the links we found through search engines visually held your funds. However, once logged in, did you double-check if your principal matched one of the principal/account identifiers for which you lost funds?

Additionally, it might seem like a dumb idea, but have you tried searching your browser history for any other URLs that might relate to ICPSwap or something similar?

-------------------------

justinchiang | 2024-02-05 17:28:30 UTC | #121

Hello, I still have questions. 1: Logging into the ICPswap wallet through the NNS wallet requires entering the NNS wallet ID. Are the NNS wallet IDs the same on old and new devices? 2: If you try logging into ICPswap with the NNS wallet on the original device after clearing browser cache, what message does it show? Could you provide a screenshot of the message? It's unlikely to keep loading indefinitely as you mentioned; in the case of a stable network, what could cause such an issue?

-------------------------

justinchiang | 2024-02-05 17:46:37 UTC | #122

I think it's necessary to create a short video demonstrating the entire process and share it with the ICPswap team. This involves logging in with the same NNS wallet ID on both the original and new devices, then checking if the PID and account ID displayed in the top right corner of ICPswap are the same after logging in. Recording such a short video is quick and would provide more credibility than just describing the situation verbally. @ICPSwap

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-06 04:41:05 UTC | #123

We already did that with the team when problem just happened. If you read the whole thread of the topic, you would understand more. I will reply your question anyway, when I have time. Thank you for your care!

-------------------------

frederikrothenberger | 2024-02-06 11:35:17 UTC | #124

@ChauDoan21165: Just to be absolutely sure, you connected using Internet Identity on both devices, right?

I.e. you did *not* connect using the ICPSwap wallet and enter a seed phrase there, right?

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-06 12:48:12 UTC | #125

For about 3 months, we just connect with internet identity normally. No need for seed phrases. 
Only when we can not connect with ICPSwap (it just keep spining) we tried a new device (IPAD) then we need seed phrases.

-------------------------

frederikrothenberger | 2024-02-06 13:45:54 UTC | #126

@ChauDoan21165: Did you enter the seed phrase on the iPad in Internet Identity or in ICPSwap?

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-06 13:57:30 UTC | #127

We came to ICPSwap, clicked to internet identity on the first line, since it is the first time we use the device, it asked to log in internet identity, we need to use 24 seed phrase. (The old device just need to see your face to approve right?" Then the new and empty address appeared.

[quote="ChauDoan21165, post:1, topic:25876"]
When we were unable to log in on our usual device (which we had been using for the past three months on a daily basis), we simply switched to a new device and logged in using the 24 mnemonic phrase.
[/quote]

@ChauDoan21165: So if you use the "usual device" and go to https://identity.ic0.app then you are able to sign in using biometrics, correct?

Apparently, the spinning issue is caused by the pop-up blocker of Safari, which you can disable in settings.

Could you try disabling the pop-up blocker and see if the spinning issue persists?

Thanks!

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-06 23:44:39 UTC | #130

It was spining when we click to the first line to connect internet computer. We used Chrome. After we signed in with new device, the old device is working fine, but it lead to new, empty address.

On your old device and new device ultimately you are using the exact same anchor / identity number right?

orcsun | 2024-02-07 19:21:08 UTC | #135

Thanks for confirming, and I am surprised you didn't use it, which means users will get different principles whenever you change the domain pointing.

So your dapp frontend is an asset canister?
Or hosting on web2 server(e.g. AWS, vercel...)?

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-02-12 15:28:15 UTC | #136

Yes, ICPSwap's front end is deployed on AWS, and ICPSwap has consistently used “app.icpswap.com” without changing the domain name and domain pointing.

Thanks so much for the reminder. Already provided feedback to the devs team, and they will decide whether to add derivationOrigin in the JS API calling after discussion. We will first conduct testing to see if adding this attribute will cause any changes to the Principles of existing users.

[quote="orcsun, post:137, topic:25876, full:true"]
Thanks for confirmation.:slightly_smiling_face:

Not quite sure about AWS, but I have been used Vercel, every deployment will generate a new URL to map your domain, even though you use the same custom domain constantly, then user will get a different principal after every new deployment.

For this case, if @ChauDoan21165 use the same identity as he declared, then most likely is your domain issue. To recover his funds, you have to roll back to that deployment. I mean if it’s that case, I hope it is not.
[/quote]

Thanks a lot! We utilize CloudFront, so during updates, the assigned domain remains unchanged.

@ChauDoan21165 suggest Plug wallet rather than Internet Identity in the future, especially related to funds

Avocado | 2024-02-09 11:16:43 UTC | #139

Don't you think it's strange that only one user had the problem, even though there are obviously dozens or even hundreds of users using Internet Identity to connect to ICPSwap?

-------------------------

orcsun | 2024-02-09 11:25:04 UTC | #140

I only tried to point one possibility. And no evidence showing this is the only one has problem.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-10 02:35:29 UTC | #141

If others have issues, they may speak up, but not everyone uses this forum and X. We're unsure what else to do besides discussing the matter, even if it becomes tedious. Thank you for your attention!

Hmmm, yeah.
I'd never heard of such a kind of issue before I noticed this post. Curious

-------------------------

RayJoe | 2024-02-18 12:23:00 UTC | #144

I feel you, it's so frustrating...
Since your friend is a novice to Web3.0, I'd suggest you ask her to check the mnemonic words / seed phrases again and recall the new algorithm if she has reshuffled the words/phrases (most probably, she might have misspelled them or forgot that she reordered the list of words by some rules) 
Best of luck to you!

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-19 09:05:55 UTC | #145

We tried many times. It is impossible to make any mistake if you deliberately try to do that. The ID nunber have to fit with mnemonic phrases.

-------------------------

sea-snake | 2024-02-19 10:37:49 UTC | #146

Yeah you can't shuffle words by accident in a mnemonic phrase, the last word of the phrase is not random but relies on all previous words as a validity check.

Edit: Just double checked, ICPSwap wallet doesn't seem to check mnemonic phrase validity on import and imports anyway at the moment.

Since Draggin will mint new sns1 tokens, please help my friend to get her 0.43 sns1.

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2024-02-24 13:58:04 UTC | #148

This might sound stupid but check if there is a software update aveilable for the original device, and do the software update and try again. I remember once it suddenly did not recognize my device II, but after the software update it recognized it again.

-------------------------

plsak | 2024-02-24 13:59:58 UTC | #149

I believe that the newly minted tokens will be available on the source SNS1 address and in the same state (in case of staked Neurons), so all should be visible here:
https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/holder/kohfg-cwurv-fgds2-dy2im-7o4qf-mvktj-skuoj-oemuy-mf6t5-5rdd6-4qe/tokens

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-27 06:30:53 UTC | #150

They do not send to addresses on exchanges.

-------------------------

plsak | 2024-02-27 12:04:33 UTC | #151

Well it's not really easy to say which address belongs to an exchange and which not, anyone can generate many accounts - I didn't actually see any confirmation if the aforementioned PID/Account belongs to ICPSwap, Stoic, Plug or other.

I think the main concern with DEX is to withdraw any SNS1 from LPs, stop trading to ensure atomicity etc.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-02-27 11:40:35 UTC | #152

I see your point. That is why I am calling for their help. Not sending to current address on ICPSwap so she can have just a bit of her asset.

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2024-02-29 20:57:25 UTC | #153

Maybe a hard factory reset will help.

frederikrothenberger | 2024-05-14 11:43:47 UTC | #163

@ICPSwap: Just another idea we had on the whole principal issue. Currently, **http**://app.icpswap.com redirects to **https**://app.icpswap.com. Has this redirect always been there?
Could @ChauDoan21165 have accessed ICPSwap over HTTP rather than HTTPS?

Hello, Frederik! Certainly! Yes, the redirect has always been here.

IRoss | 2024-05-23 13:05:23 UTC | #165

Hey! I was searching for a way to solve a problem I had with connecting my Stoic wallet  and came upon this thread. Have you managed to resolve your issue, and if not, I was wondering did you ever try connecting to ICPswap through stoicwallet linked through the same Internet Identity?

What I mean is, connect to the swap like this...
InternetIdentity -> StoicWallet -> ICPSwap
instead of...
InternetIdentity -> ICPSwap

Doing that creates different addresses, which are still linked to the same InternetIdentity. I'm not saying this is what happened, but just throwing possibilities out, maybe helping to think outside box on this one

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-05-28 13:19:26 UTC | #166
