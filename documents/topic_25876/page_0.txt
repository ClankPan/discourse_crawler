SOS! One day, my friend logged into her ICPSwap account and discovered that she was redirected to a completely new and empty account, unable to access her previous account containing a significant amount of funds. The technical support staff is claiming that such a situation is impossible, stating that an Internet Identity can only be associated with a single address on ICPSwap. They have denied any responsibility.

I personally assisted my friend in setting up her Internet Identity and guided her through the token swapping process on ICPSwap. As an elementary school teacher, 650 ICP represents a substantial sum of money for her. We are being blamed for making a mistake, but we cannot comprehend what mistake we could have possibly made. When we were unable to log in on our usual device (which we had been using for the past three months on a daily basis), we simply switched to a new device and logged in using the 24 mnemonic phrase.

I am curious if their code contains any functionality that can trace which Internet Identity is linked to a specific address. If this feature exists, it would conclusively prove that my friend possesses only one Internet Identity and would absolve us of any blame. Please assist us, as this incident not only damages ICPSwap's reputation but also undermines trust in the entire Internet Computer system. Thank you for your support!

I've been trying to help them on X for some time, but we couldn't find a solution.
What's been adviced:
- checking if old icpswap wallet still has funds - it does have them intact(in various tokens)
- checking if the same Internet Identity was used, they claim to have only one Internet Identity
- checking if the URL is original and indeed belongs to the icpswap, it seems to be legit icpswap

Curious as well, how could such thing ever happen.
Many of us store at least some portion of ICP/tokens on DEXes like icpswap or sonic...

Ideas?

ChauDoan21165 | 2023-12-25 10:42:32 UTC | #3

Thank you Let4be. I am so stressed for the last few days. I wanted to help but it turned out made her lost money. I felt lucky cause if that happen to me, I would be devastated. Just moved all the tokens out from ICPSwap. Keeping those in nns wallets is safe? 
All help in desperate situation is precious.

Apologies for the inconvenience caused to everyone.

Let us briefly explain the situation, @ChauDoan21165, please verify if what I'm saying is correct.

ChauDoan recommended a friend to experience the IC ecosystem and his friend, purchased a lot of SNS tokens on ICPSwap. We're incredibly grateful for this support. His friend's address (or the address generated by connecting their Internet Identity to ICPSwap) is:

kohfg-cwurv-fgds2-dy2im-7o4qf-mvktj-skuoj-oemuy-mf6t5-5rdd6-4qe
1b10558206448890541ad02104c7022899635d864b5f72205ce2699da5abe035

The address was running fine for several months until December 20th when ChauDoan asked the community Mod in the TG group about a balance display issue. At that time, the Mod wasn't aware of the situation and suggested ChauDoan reconnect their wallet or try logging in using a computer or another device.

ChauDoan tried several methods. It wasn't until December 22nd, after extended communication between ChauDoan and the Mod in the TG group, that we understood the whole scenario. It turned out that his friend encountered an issue: she logged in using her Internet Identity on an iPad (formerly a phone) and connected to ICPSwap, generating a new wallet address:

ukqu3-pjqtn-m4g4w-r5mra-kseuu-bpn36-fynja-j3hru-54tdc-i6g4e-5ae
4a3ed9d128a0749d21f0009aa868cb507ed4c0a7f37f7614bc788b0aad889339

ChauDoan suspected a technical issue with ICPSwap. The Mod explained that connecting an Internet Identity to different DApps within the IC ecosystem generates a unique address that remains unchanged. The team was informed, and team members tried multiple Internet Identities and even one created a long time ago, connecting to ICPSwap, and the addresses remained constant (some wallets even had ICP balances. If it were a new address, there wouldn't be any ICP balance).

We thought that their friend either made a mistake in backing up the mnemonic phrase or created a new Internet Identity. This would make sense. Cause if the wallet address changes when connecting an Internet Identity to a DApp, it would jeopardize the assets of users within the IC ecosystem.

While the Mod explained this to ChauDoan, We also directly communicated with his friend many times over these two to three days. We inquired about the use of Plug, NFID wallets, the possibility of using NNS, creating multiple Internet Identities, modifications in mnemonic phrase backups, and how her nephew assisted in logging into the Internet Identity on the iPad, but unfortunately, no helpful information was obtained. ChauDoan's friend insists there's only one Internet Identity.

We're stuck, and we also hope his friend can get his wallet back. Continue to support and experience the IC ecosystem!

And ChauDoan is under immense pressure. He wanted his friend to follow the promising IC ecosystem and reap the deserved benefits, indeed they encountered great news of the ICP surge, but encountered this bad issue.

We kindly seek ideas and suggestions from community members and DFINITY development team members to assist ChauDoan's friend. Your support is highly appreciated!

Sorry, ChauDoan, NNS wallet is great. However, please be mindful not to transfer tokens to NNS, such as OGY, that haven't yet been listed on the NNS.

This specific feature of **Internet Identity** to generate a new **address/principal id pair** for each application seems cool from a security point of view, but in practice it creates a lot of problems, especially for beginners. This is not the first or even the tenth time I have seen this problem with newcomers. 

It is much more understandable and practical to use a single address/principal, as it is implemented on **Ethereum** (imho).

Hello,

based on my experience I'd as first recommend to ask the **user to re-login to [ICPSwap](https://app.icpswap.com/) (best on the original device) using all available options**. 

It could have happened that (as it was early interaction with ICP ecosystem) the user simply didn't notice which option selected (each would create or use different PID) - and as for subsequent logons to ICPSwap this is automatically triggered, without user having to recall the process, the right method might be just missed.

Other option which I'm thinking about is to **verify which DApp holds the above `Principal ID` and/or `Account ID`** - if is it possible - that would either help to identify the right login method or will introduce new core topic for investigation (probably for DFINITY).

Thank you! It would be very helpful if the digital ID of the Internet Identity and its corresponding address could be confirmed.

I will answere you one by one: 
1.	
“ChauDoan tried several methods. It wasn’t until December 22nd, after extended communication between ChauDoan and the Mod in the TG group, that we understood the whole scenario. It turned out that his friend encountered an issue: she logged in using her Internet Identity on an iPad (formerly a phone) and connected to ICPSwap, generating a new wallet address:” 
ICPSwap has problem since the day I was sitting next to her. I log in fine. She could not. Her phone keep spinning. I contacted you on that day after leaving her. 
We think something wrong with the phone. We ask her nephew, an computer expert to try log in by her ipad using 24 mnemonic phrase. That was easy but the account was empty. We did not know that is a new address. When we chat with Terence, he let us know that is a new address. 
2.	“ChauDoan suspected a technical issue with ICPSwap.”
I am computer engineer and I am only one help her from start. I know she is not technical so I told her to screen shot her internet identiy and 24 mnemonic phrase on that day. I helped her to transfer icp from Binance to ICPSwap. We do not have any other wallet. I want to keep it as simple as possible for her cause I know this stuff very confusing for her. 
3.	“The Mod explained that connecting an Internet Identity to different DApps within the IC ecosystem generates a unique address that remains unchanged. The team was informed, and team members tried multiple Internet Identities and even one created a long time ago, connecting to ICPSwap, and the addresses remained constant (some wallets even had ICP balances. If it were a new address, there wouldn’t be any ICP balance).
You have such a weak argument. If that happen with your team members then the percentage of people have similar problem would be so high. This is a trusting issue here. You do not believe we have only one internet computer identity and that is our mistake. 
I hope time will let you know more. I suggest you find the way to identify which internet computer identiy link to one address. 
One proof that would make you reconsider is. Now she can use her old phone with the same internet identity to log in ICPSwap. I wonder if you can use one phone to log in two internet identity, then that would give her two lines of number as option to choose which ii she is using like: 229800 and 224567… for example. 
Since that day, she has not changed anything with her old phone. 
4.	
“We thought that their friend either made a mistake in backing up the mnemonic phrase or created a new Internet Identity. This would make sense. Cause if the wallet address changes when connecting an Internet Identity to a DApp, it would jeopardize the assets of users within the IC ecosystem.”

ChauDoan21165 | 2023-12-25 15:15:13 UTC | #11

I strongly believe that Dfinity should implement a feature that allows for the identification of the Internet Identity responsible for creating a specific address on ICPSwap. Just like how a bank can trace the source of funds and the account they are deposited into, this functionality would greatly enhance transparency and accountability within the system. By knowing the individuals who bring money into the system, it would provide a definitive way to confirm the accuracy of claims.

-------------------------

let4be | 2023-12-25 15:22:20 UTC | #12

Just remember than NNS wallet can hold only SNS-listed tokens...

Anyone can create a token on ICP and various DEXes have different rules, 
- on icpswap you can hold/trade ANY token
- on sonic you can hold/trade only white-listed tokens
- on nns wallet you can hold only tokens that are part of a DAO and went thru SNS

if you send a non supported token say to sonic or NNS wallet you will lose access to it.

ChauDoan21165 | 2023-12-25 16:07:43 UTC | #15

I understand your concerns and the need to address the possibility of having two Internet Identities. However, I would like to present a logical argument to support our case. It should be apparent that the address created on ICPSwap would have been generated on the same day or possibly the day after we created the Internet Identity for her. The screenshot of the Internet Identity number and the 24 mnemonic phrase should indicate the date of creation. If, by accident, we had created a new Internet Identity and subsequently a new address on ICPSwap a few days ago, then that particular Internet Identity must have been accidentally created several months ago. In such a case, the screenshot would display an older date. Moreover, if we had used the new Internet Identity on the iPad and created a new address on ICPSwap, then why would her old phone with the old Internet Identity be able to log in to the new ICPSwap address? These points should be considered. From our perspective, there is no reason for us to fabricate such a complicated situation.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-12-25 16:17:12 UTC | #16

As a 3rd party, we don't think ICPSwap intentionally did something that resulted in your loss. 
So let's find the problem. Can you find the address that has 650 ICP in it, perhaps this will help https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ 
Maybe start with your Binance address, or if you could provide a date+time and amount of ICPSwap trade, that will also be useful.

There is also this issue which may be related https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upgrade-agent-js-to-resolve-a-chrome-issue/22364

What about screen shot of the II we created few months ago. In that case, we still access to the old address.

Ok, so

Authenticating using Internet Identity (few months ago)  resulted in
kohfg-cwurv-fgds2-dy2im-7o4qf-mvktj-skuoj-oemuy-mf6t5-5rdd6-4qe

Later the same identity allegedly (22 Dec) resulted in 
ukqu3-pjqtn-m4g4w-r5mra-kseuu-bpn36-fynja-j3hru-54tdc-i6g4e-5ae

II devs can check if any code changes could have caused it, give them some time to answer.
And please don't post this in every twitter thread out there :) You will get a response asap

ICPSwap can also check if they changed their agentjs library and let us know when and what version changes there were

sea-snake | 2023-12-25 18:16:39 UTC | #22

Did icpswap maybe change the internet identity domain to/from identity.ic0.app, identity.icp0.io or identity.internetcomputer.org?

I've seen threads before where this caused a change in identity.

Keep in mind, internet identity principals are tied to a domain and delegated. So an app using internet identity cannot suddenly change the identity a user has from their end.

The above chrome bug can probably cause issues seen here, if you have previously transferred tokens both into and out of the same account address without any issues, you can't have been affected by the bug.

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2023-12-26 07:28:52 UTC | #23

Using one or the other does not change the principal. The domain name used to sign in is tied to the principal that is generated. If ICPSwap consistently used app.icpswap.com, regardless of whether [identity.ic0.app](https://identity.ic0.app/) or [identity.internetcomputer.org](https://identity.internetcomputer.org/) was used, the same principal is generated.

ChauDoan21165 | 2023-12-26 11:33:50 UTC | #26

I have tried to consider @ICPSwap's perspective. If you still have doubts and believe that our current Internet Identity is the new one, the screenshot provided indicates a date from a few months ago when I initially set up the Internet Identity and ICPSwap address for my friend. This suggests that we have been using the other Internet Identity for the past few months. Additionally, a few days ago, we accidentally used the "new" Internet Identity to log in. Does it make sense to you?

-------------------------

sea-snake | 2023-12-26 13:56:06 UTC | #27

Ah yeah you're right, it's just that an anchor from one II domain is not available on another domain unless you manually e.g. recover from passphrase or use the add device link workaround.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-03 13:40:24 UTC | #29

Just to clarify, we have only one Internet Identity. I assisted my friend in creating it a few months ago, and we have been using that same identity ever since. We have all the records of transferring ICP from Binance to ICPSwap. There was no reason for us to create a second Internet Identity when everything has been functioning smoothly for the past few months. This issue is entirely the technical fault of ICPSwap. Please do not deny this and take responsibility for it.

-------------------------

free_will5 | 2024-01-03 14:35:45 UTC | #30

Dfinity should investigate into this. I do not think it’s ICPSwap’s error. I had a similar experience with plug wallet. Didn’t think too much of as no coin was lost in the process. I have a plug wallet extension on pc — chrome and well saved seed phrase. One time I thought to use same wallet on phone. So I downloaded the app on iPhone and then used same  seed phrase. This created a new PID with a clean slate wallet. I had thought it would have same PID from pc with the tokens in it. It didn’t and then I imagined if I had lost my pc and used seed phrase to reimport the wallet, all tokens on pc wallet would have been lost. It appears to be a similar situation here. It appears that importing a wallet with seed phrase on a new device is likely to create different PID in which case I don’t see the point of seed phrase recovery if it doesn’t recover old account.  On another occasion, same thing happened with ICdex. I used the same internet ID to sign into my icdex from a different device and a new account and PID popped up with no tokens. 
On both situations, my accounts on other devices had no issue so I wasn’t concerned about the tokens. However it brought the question as to whether this is something that happens to other people too and if so, then something is wrong.

If you have OGY stuck in your NNS there is a hack that has worked in the past thanks to @peterparker.

It is not for the faint of heart!  It would be great if there were some more 'official unofficial' way to just manually add an ICRC1 token via the NNS. :)

https://github.com/peterpeterparker/yolosns

You'll need to run something like this from the chrome console while logged into the NNS.

***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!***

```
const {transfer} = await import("https://unpkg.com/yolosns@latest/dist/esm/index.js")
await transfer({ledgerCanisterId: 'jwcfb-hyaaa-aaaaj-aac4q-ca', owner: '{put receiving principal here}', amount: 1234n, fee: 200000n});
```

The amount is in e8s...so 1 OGY is 100000000

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-03 15:02:07 UTC | #33

Yes, the situation is indeed quite similar. On that particular day, my friend couldn't use her regular phone and had to log in to ICPSwap using her iPad and the seed phrase, which resulted in this problem. If it's not ICPSwap's fault, perhaps it could be related to Dfinity?
My friend still uses her regular phone, but whenever she logs into ICPSwap, it takes her to the new address. Thank you for your concern. We appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.

-------------------------

free_will5 | 2024-01-04 01:59:19 UTC | #34

One other scenario is if she cleared cache on her iPhone browser, then it’s possible for browser to not recognize her old account and instead take in new account created on iPad. If she had used her account on another device in the past and not clear history, she can try signing in from that device. When using internet ID, never clear browser history. This is what I understood before. When you do, you are likely to start all over with seed phrase to sign in. (Important! Do not respond to people sending you messages in your private message claiming to be dfinity Team — They are most probably scammers)

Al crear la identidad en el móvil supongo que guardaste la frase semilla, si es así puedes reiniciar tu identidad desde 0 en el ipad?, icpswap da problemas en el móvil, para mi la clave está en la frase semilla inicial, es la que te llevará a tu billetera

-------------------------

NETLOC410 | 2024-01-05 11:08:11 UTC | #45

after reading this topic i am curious as to how they set up the same internet identity on multiple devices.
if the security chip is changed (different device) it will not register as the same identity. accessing the wallet is not the same as holding the identity. i wonder if accessing the wallet using fingerprint and generating the identity again on a new terminal from the same wallet using say face id would still make it a different value 
is there anything saying that one id is locked to one wallet address?
how is that value pair tangible? anything that could allow the linked id and wallet to converge and create a redundancy without verifying the value is not already in use.
when i want to register a new device with my id and i cannot use the smart card or usb dongle that i used previously will it generate a new id or allow me to use the same one?

Mi amigo, de hecho hemos guardado nuestra frase semilla, por eso podemos iniciar sesión usando el iPad en lugar de nuestro teléfono habitual.

Yes, you can log in an Internet Identity with multiple devices. That is good because you may loose the original device.

NETLOC410 | 2024-01-05 11:33:29 UTC | #52

if the id is currently in use on another device phone2 and you try to activate a new device ipad would it cause this issue? Possibly from not being able to pick up on the handle that is occupied by the working device? Many exchanges log the user out when the login is called from a new device to solve that issue.

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-05 11:59:15 UTC | #58

The problem is undeniably real, and I have been voicing my concerns loudly for quite some time. However, it appears that they have difficulty hearing and acknowledging the issue. As a significant investor in ICP, I have been urging my friends to join me, that show my trust in ICP but their response has been perplexing to me.

-------------------------

Por supuesto. Si vuelves a leer desde el principio, podrás comprenderlo mejor.

plsak | 2024-01-06 09:28:29 UTC | #61

Side note:
1. DFINITY is a major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain but not the owner
2. due level of support from DFINITY (or anyone else) that one can claim depends on a contract (SLA) that those parties have, e.g. I'm also investor in ICP but don't have any contract with DFINITY so in case of problems I'll be happy for a `best effort` help - being loud sometimes helps (usually in the beginning), sometimes causes damage in professional relations (IMO if it turns into too much pressure)

Este es más un mensaje para dfinity, desde mi profundo desconocimiento técnico, vamos a suponer que alguien ha cometido un error, entiendo que la dirección dónde están alojados los tokens están vinculados a un dispositivo mas allá de una identidad de Internet o una frase semilla, mi planteamiento es el siguiente: si el dispositivo asociado sigue vinculado a esa dirección el poseedor del dispositivo debe mantener los derechos, la cuestión es ¿como dfinity puede resolver este dilema?

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-08 17:26:56 UTC | #67

Their response is utterly unhelpful. It seems they haven't even read the issue or made any effort to identify the problem.

Thanks for contacting the DFINITY Support Team.
 
In order to best help troubleshoot your issue, Internet Identity ensures privacy by generating a unique pseudonym for each dapp whenever an anchor is used. 
 
This prevents the dapp from tracking users across the various dapps they use. 
 
This means that each dapp which you connect to has a unique wallet address. Assets are not transferred across dapps because dapps don't share a common wallet. 
 
Internet Identity ensures privacy by generating a unique pseudonym address for each dapp whenever an anchor is used. You would need to send the funds to the wallet address connected in the dapp.  

Best,
DFINITY Support Team

"Internet Identity ensures privacy by generating a unique pseudonym address for each dapp whenever an anchor is used. You would need to send the funds to the wallet address connected in the dapp. 
So, how do you explain the fact that in this situation, despite using a single Internet Identity, it has led us to a new address on ICPSwap?

-------------------------

plsak | 2024-01-09 12:59:46 UTC | #69

Hi, to help more, I actually think following should be the right order of resolution steps:

**1.** user re-tries logins on original device as per my previous comment
[quote="plsak, post:7, topic:25876"]
**user to re-login to [ICPSwap ](https://app.icpswap.com/) (best on the original device) using all available options**.
[/quote]
- it will be convenient to take some screenshots to collect evidence of which II is used and what are the resultant addresses for all login options

**2.** investigation with @ICPSwap - that is the DApp with which the user interacted
- a lot was done already but possibly more can be conducted
  - like videocall with the user where the user is sharing and showing what all happened etc.
- **NOTE**: if anyone has an issue with some app (e.g. `Netflix`), then seeks support from that app directly
  - this step is generic and not related to differences between Web2 and Web3

**3.** if @ICPSwap suspects that there is some glitch with `Internet Identity generating a unique address` they should reach out to DFINITY support with **summary, logs and other evidence** for further investigation
- in this case, **DFINITY is the last level of support, not starting from zero but building up on already collected findings**
- **NOTE**: if support team of some app (e.g. `Netflix`) suspects that there is a problem with underlying infrastructure, then this team seeks support from provider of the underlying infrastructure (e.g. `AWS` in case of `Netflix`)
  - this step is generic and not related to differences between Web2 and Web3

**DISCLAIMER**: I don't have any knowledge of involved parties support options and SLAs, there can be also privacy concerns and other complications.

I must share this until they can resolve this issue and my friend can regain access to her account. This situation is highly detrimental to their reputation. It also affects me negatively as I have invested heavily in ICP and tokens in IC ecosystem.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-10 03:42:46 UTC | #72

We have all the transaction records from Binance to the ICPSwap address. Besides that, what else do we need? All you have to do is set up an internet identity and connect to @ICPSwap, right? It's quite simple. Even if you intentionally try to do something wrong, you won't be able to. You try to put in the wrong seed phrase, it refuses anyway.

"Internet Identity ensures privacy by generating a unique pseudonym address for each dapp whenever an anchor is used." So, the problem may be that there is a slippage of the anchor that links an internet identity to an address in ICPSwap. That is the only explanation I can think of.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-12 15:16:36 UTC | #74

I believe that if they genuinely want to fix the situation, they have the ability to do so. Currently, it seems they are placing the blame on me. Do you have any suggestions on how I can take legal action in this case?

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-15 01:33:18 UTC | #75

They know deep down that it is their mistake, but they choose to ignore us!

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-16 10:24:29 UTC | #76

A few days before this happened, ICPSwap was displaying incorrect token balances, particularly with SNS1. We had a sense that something was amiss, but we never anticipated it would escalate to such a severe extent.

-------------------------

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-16 10:43:41 UTC | #77

I sincerely hope that the community takes notice of these incidents and that no one else loses money. In the case of my friend, it amounts to 650 ICP. If such an event were to happen to me with a significantly larger account, the consequences would be devastating.

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-18 01:13:46 UTC | #78

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-20 02:37:10 UTC | #79

I don't think @ICPSwap can succeed with this major flaw in their code.

ChauDoan21165 | 2024-01-21 00:13:26 UTC | #80

They're deliberately brushing me off, foolishly expecting the problem to vanish. But let's be clear: the money we've lost is still ours, and that fact cannot be ignored.

Ajki | 2024-01-22 16:13:48 UTC | #86

@peterparker, can a dApp receive different anchor associated with the same Internet Identity?
I assume that it can't, and if that's the case, then it's not likely that the mistake is on the ICPSwap side and more likely that it's on the user's side.

I rushed through the topic and might have missed if it was already answered. If so, I apologize.

-------------------------

plsak | 2024-01-22 16:43:10 UTC | #87

Hi, I think this is a nice description from @peterparker 

[quote="peterparker, post:25, topic:25876"]
The domain name used to sign in is tied to the principal that is generated. If ICPSwap consistently used [app.icpswap.com](http://app.icpswap.com), regardless of whether [identity.ic0.app](https://identity.ic0.app/) or [identity.internetcomputer.org ](https://identity.internetcomputer.org/) was used, the same principal is generated.

[quote="Ajki, post:86, topic:25876"]

A dapp cannot receive an anchor, a dapp can receive a principal.

To sign-in in Internet Identity one used what was called an anchor which is now called an identity (I think).

Regarding the II domain, please let me know if the answer pointed [above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sos-critical-problem-with-icpswap/25876/87?u=peterparker) resolve your question or if I should add anything.

Indeed, if the principal remains constant, it would be inconceivable for an individual logging in with the same identity on @ICPSwap to be linked to a different wallet. 

What sort of glitch or malfunction would be necessary on @ICPSwap's end to allow such an anomaly to occur?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-01-22 19:20:47 UTC | #90

[quote="Ajki, post:89, topic:25876"]
What sort of glitch or malfunction would be necessary on @ICPSwap’s end to allow such an anomaly to occur?
[/quote]

I took a step back to think about it, and I'm going to share here a **hypothesis**: What if there actually was no glitch, no malfunction, and no bugs?

Let's accept that:

- Internet Identity worked as expected, generating the same principal for the same domain/anchor.
- ICPSwap did its due diligence work and never changed their code or configuration.
- OP always used the same anchor.

In other words, everything is and was set correctly, and all login information was constant.

Now, here's the hypothesis and a potential scenario:

What if the OP didn't always use a bookmark to access https://app.icpswap.com/, but inadvertently used a back link, for example in a blog post, or forum post or such as one indexed in Google Search, to access ICPSwap on its canister-ID URL https://zuiuq-qqaaa-aaaan-qa4cq-cai.ic0.app/? After all, it looks exactly the same, both links and dapps.

So, without noticing, OP might have opened this latter URL, signed in with Internet Identity, and given that another domain was used for sign-in, Internet Identity generated another principal.

This would be a possible scenario I can think of; however, to be proven, OP would have to confirm that they don't use bookmarks absolutely 100% of the time.

And again, this is an absolute **hypothesis**, think of it more like a private detective throwing out an idea to solve a mystery on MythBusters.

PS.: an example of back links I'm referring too

![Capture d’écran 2024-01-22 à 20.15.17|690x463](upload://o9GK6tlYep5xQFRXCqzWIMSZBlp.jpeg)

-------------------------

Ajki | 2024-01-22 20:26:09 UTC | #91

In that case, @ChauDoan21165 simply needs to log in at both addresses and examine the wallet; he will likely find his funds in one of them.

[https://icpswap.com](https://icpswap.com/)
 [https://rv6ki-dyaaa-aaaah-aaa5q-cai.raw.ic0.app](https://rv6ki-dyaaa-aaaah-aaa5q-cai.raw.ic0.app/)

In the event that he doesn't find a wallet with funds, what kind of code changes could @ICPSwap make to change a connection between the principal and the wallet? It's not as if they can access his funds, so malicious intent shouldn't even be a consideration.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-01-22 20:47:38 UTC | #92

[quote="Ajki, post:91, topic:25876"]

[https://zuiuq-qqaaa-aaaan-qa4cq-cai.ic0.app](https://zuiuq-qqaaa-aaaan-qa4cq-cai.ic0.app)

But again that was an hypothesis, so maybe there is some other back links and/or other canister ids?

[quote="Ajki, post:91, topic:25876"]

Not sure what you mean here, I just gonna assume you are refering to what can make a principal become different. As already staten, it's to my knowledge either different domain or different anchor, nothin else.

-------------------------

Hi @ChauDoan21165 

As others already have said, there seem to be a few _test_ versions of ICP swap available:
* https://zuiuq-qqaaa-aaaan-qa4cq-cai.ic0.app
* https://zuiuq-qqaaa-aaaan-qa4cq-cai.raw.ic0.app
* https://rv6ki-dyaaa-aaaah-aaa5q-cai.ic0.app
* https://rv6ki-dyaaa-aaaah-aaa5q-cai.raw.ic0.app

Please check that none of these show a balance.

---

@ICPSwap: Even if you have consistently used https://app.icpswap.com, was the front end always **exclusively** hosted from AWS as it is now?

If you had the front-end served from a canister using the custom domains feature (i.e. accessible on https://app.icpswap.com), during that time it would **also** have been accessible on https://<canister_id>.ic0.app.

* Could please you confirm that the domain app.icpswap.com has *never* pointed to a canister?
* Could you also please list all canisters that were ever used to host _some_ version of the ICPSwap front end? I.e. tell us whether the list above is complete?

-------------------------

frederikrothenberger | 2024-01-23 08:37:03 UTC | #96

Many thanks to @frederikrothenberger @peterparker @Ajki for helping and sharing the information.

Replied as below:
1/ The IC URL, https://zuiuq-qqaaa-aaaan-qa4cq-cai.ic0.app is for ICPSwap V3 Test Version. This version used TICP test tokens to interact and does not have liquidity related to SNS tokens.

2/ The IC URL, https://rv6ki-dyaaa-aaaah-aaa5q-cai.ic0.app is used for testing ICPSwap with WICP (wrap ICP). This is one of the earliest URLs for ICPSwap but didn't integrate internet identity at that time.

3/ The IC URL, https://3pbcj-viaaa-aaaah-qaajq-cai.ic0.app is the official website of ICPSwap (www.icpswap.com), not the DApp. It has been used for a long time ago. But it doesn't connect to any wallets.

4/There is also an IC URL, https://bplw4-cqaaa-aaaag-qcb7q-cai.icp0.io
We briefly used this container to deploy the frontend around the end of May 2022, approximately lasting for 2-3 days.
