This method is used to store the byte array of the wasm file. But don't know how to call it. I tried two ways, both failed:

1. The UI interface first gets the byte array of the wasm file, and then calls the store_wasm_file method to store it, but querying the wasm byte array will cause the browser to out of memory.

2. Get the byte array through the dfx canister call wasm_file get_wasm_bytes command, and then store it through the dfx canister call cycles_wallet wallet_store_wallet_wasm command. But Linux will report an error when executing the command: Argument list too long
