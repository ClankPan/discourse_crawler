# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/087190165198a9dc7b3c9cf80e0812c0c03964c6/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 087190165198a9dc7b3c9cf80e0812c0c03964c6
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of this replica update.

Proposal ID: **126293**
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566445/rvm-proposal-126293) 

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, and @ilbert.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @Gekctek and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here if you have any questions or suggestions.

RECRUITING NOTE: 
The CodeGov Project is offering attractive bounty payments to experienced Rust developers who are interested in spending a few hours each week reviewing Replica Version Management proposals, which are code changes that are submitted to the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) governance system for adoption or rejection.  We do this through IC-OS Verification and by performing a sanity check on the Release Notes.  Our votes are cast according to the findings of our reviewers.  Proposals are usually submitted on a Friday and we complete our reviews within 48 hours.  Each reviewer posts a summary of their findings in the [CodeGov portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566445/rvm-proposal-126293) and the bounty payment is made using the tipping feature of DSCVR with ckBTC equivalent to USD.  The bounty is always announced in [this bounty payment post](https://dscvr.one/post/11096526/the-current-bounty-per-person-for-reviews-ic-os-verification) on the portal and the [deliverables for each review](https://www.codegov.org/reviews/deliverables) can be found on the codegov.org website.  It is a requirement to [Apply](https://www.codegov.org/apply) on the codegov.org website and to complete either Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN in order to get paid the bounty.  Please send me a DM or an email at codegov.org@gmail.com if you would like to discuss this opportunity further.

Here are a few highlights from the CodeGov reviews this week...

@ZackDS commented "The new categorization of the release notes in the proposal summary is very nice and makes it easier to follow."

@Zane indicated...
[[6b292dc](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/6b292dc)]
`call` method of `QueryService` now returns a bad request status code if the calling canister isn't the management canister and the canister id is not equal to the effective id.
Not sure how it relates to the described fix.

@zane indicated...
[[54e6ab6](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/54e6ab6)]
Increased `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_BYTES` from 8 to 128MBs, `QuicTransport` struct has seen minor modifications: `rt` field is now an immutable reference to tokio runtime handle instead of a copy and the `router` is no longer an optional value, most lines changed are related to updating the code to the new interface.
It matches the description, the one in the dashboard only mentions the size increase but the detailed one contains all the changes.

@cyberowl found a small grammar issue in [[d16296c](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/d16296c)] and reported it [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/d16296c#r134067986).

@massimoalbarello commented...
[[d16296c](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/d16296c)] added logic to persist page deltas in an overlay file, together with the related storage metrics. Found incomplete documentation (nothing important) and reported it [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/6b292dc#r134080686).

@massimoalbarello indicated...
[[6b292dc](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/6b292dc)] not sure how the changes fix what is described. I asked for more info [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/6b292dc#r134080686).

@ilbert left a [question](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/e920a65#commitcomment-134079284) on GitHub about why the rate limit has been removed in [[e920a65](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/e920a65)]

@ilbert left a [comment](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/d16296c#r134079523) on GitHub about a typo in [[d16296c](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/d16296c)]

@ilbert left a [comment](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/54e6ab6#r134080387) on GitHub about a typo in [[54e6ab6](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/54e6ab6)]

@ilbert left two comments [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/7feca89#r134081261) and [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/7feca89#r134081261) about typos in [[7feca89](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/7feca89)]
