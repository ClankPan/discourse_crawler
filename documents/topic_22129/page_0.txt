**Objective**

The current Named Neuron environment lacks code-based contributors outside of the DFINITY Foundation. This Call to Action aims to enhance the involvement of participating and contributing named neurons, particularly targeting SNS Foundations with ample available resources.

**Background**

Presently, the DFINITY Foundation wields over 99% of voting power when it comes to code-based topics, except Replicas, where there's a ~10% reduction compared to other topics.

This dominance traces back to the Genesis of the Internet Computer, during which DFINITY assigned themselves 100% of Voting Power as "followees." This configuration allowed DFINITY to govern the protocol's initial stages effectively and execute vital proposals promptly.

However, more than two years after Genesis, this voting power remains firmly in DFINITY's control, citing a "lack of alternative contributors" as the reason. It's pertinent to note that the present alternative contributors to the NNS are viewed as unsustainable due to their lack of funding sources.

This circumstance presents a risk, as the Internet Computer strives for decentralization but is currently governed by a singular, self-appointed centralized entity through the NNS.

This leads us into the concept of "SNS Foundation Named Neurons";

While not universally attainable for every SNS Project due to differing funding levels, this initiative seeks the participation of SNS Foundations in bridging the gap and contributing to the Internet Computer from a code-based perspective as Named Neurons.

This endeavor is both rational and feasible, with a multitude of benefits for SNS Foundations and dApps building on the Internet Computer, as outlined below:

* Sustainability Concerns:

The paramount concern surrounding alternative contributors centers on their sustained financial viability, a critical element in maintaining a vibrant and progressive ecosystem. This is where the significance of SNS Foundations' involvement cannot be understated. With access to substantial funding derived from SNS DAOs, often earmarked for advancing development, Foundations possess a unique capability to compensate Named Neuron contributions. By actively leveraging their financial resources to support and incentivize these contributors, Foundations can infuse stability into the ecosystem, ensuring that it thrives not merely in the present but well into the future.

* Aligning Self-Interests:

Delving deeper into the question of why SNS DAOs should shoulder the responsibility of Named Neuron contributions unveils a profound connection to the essence of decentralization. SNS DAOs, functioning within the ambit of the formidable NNS, inherently rely on a decentralized governance framework for equitable decision-making. By embracing the role of contributing Named Neurons, Foundations can effectively cement their position as pillars of this decentralized community. This proactive participation serves as a safeguard against the potential upheaval that disagreements can create. Drawing parallels to the historical "Block Wars" between BCH and BTC, it's evident that decentralized systems thrive when a diverse range of contributors collaboratively shape the ecosystem's trajectory. Foundations, by embracing this stance, not only protect their own interests but collectively contribute to an environment conducive to progress.

* Development Quality Assurance:

The apprehensions surrounding the quality of contributions from alternative contributors underscore the imperative of maintaining a high standard of development within the ecosystem. Here, the role of SNS Foundations takes on an added significance. As the foundational architects of SNS dApps, these developers have not only undergone rigorous scrutiny of DFINITY and the community but have also earned a distinct "vote of confidence" from the ecosystem. This signifies a level of trust established through proven track records and a commitment to excellence. As contributing Named Neurons, they continue to uphold this standard, reinforcing the ecosystem's credibility and reinforcing the notion that decentralization thrives when underpinned by individuals and entities with a demonstrated dedication to quality and innovation.

**Conclusion**

In sum, the integration of SNS Foundations as Named Neurons transcends mere participation; it embodies an unwavering dedication to the fundamental principles of decentralization. By addressing sustainability concerns, safeguarding self-interests through proactive participation, and upholding development quality, Foundations play an instrumental role in shaping a robust, decentralized ecosystem primed for sustained advancement. In doing so, they epitomize the collaborative ethos inherent in genuine decentralization, ensuring that the Internet Computer stands as a paragon of collective progress and innovation.

I choose to follow DFINITY, because I trust them on code based decisions for ICP. I think following other neurons would be a mistake. You're definition of 'decentralization' could cause damage to ICP. Frankly, I don't trust other neurons enough to follow them for voting on code based proposals.

Aside from Governance / SNS proposals, so do I! 

I’m not trying to take anything away from DFINITY - they’ve obviously been the leading/primary contributor to ICP for the last 5 years+. 

However, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t encourage other contributors to the Internet Computer! It’s an open source decentralized protocol built in Rust, which is an extremely well documented language, that has pre-existed ICP. 

This means that over time, we should strive for alternative contributors (to DFINITY), that are capable of making reputable contributions to the Internet Computer!

In my opinion, the best way to start doing this is from within the ecosystem - those who have built with the protocol; know it’s strengths, weaknesses, and the direction they need it to evolve in to maintain a cutting edge developing environment. 

I don’t believe it is constructive to say that alternative  Named Neurons (to DFINITY) is harmful to the network. The Followee System is a powerful tool, and I believe it is more harmful for the network in the instance people are discouraged to use it, while it’s currently dominated in voting power by a single entity.

The Followee System is a unique construct to ICP, highlighting the power of choice & liquid democracy. While it’s true you, and many others actively, contently choose to follow DFINITY - there is no accurate measure to the quantity that are following due to a pre-assignment at Genesis, or feel as though there are no other options to continue collecting their neurons APY. 

Given this unique ability - choice - it’s important to provide the option of adequate, competent choices within each proposal topic. 

I’m not recommending people follow these potential named neurons, nor have I phrased this as a proposal (“demanding” action), but rather a Call to Action (“requesting” action) to the Core Foundations of current & future SNS DAOs, who are willing to contribute to the governance & decentralization of ICP.

I am not an ex-employee of the foundation - nor am I directly financially compensated for any of the governance work I do. The only form of income I personally receive from ICP are the staking rewards from my Neuron. This seems like an attempted sweeping statement to discredit this topic, due to fear of potential decentralization.

Hey @Accumulating.icp at a high level I think this is a good idea worth further discussion among the community.  Thanks for starting the conversation.  I always appreciate when I see people trying to ideate on ways to advance decentralization of the IC and that seems to be your goal here.  Below are a few questions and comments that come to mind initially.

Do you think SNS projects should be more incentivized to make code-based contributions to the IC than projects that have not gone through the SNS yet (or maybe never plan that path)?  I used to think all projects should be incentivized to make these kinds of decentralized contributions, but there really are not any larger projects that have contributed to the NNS in this way (at least not publicly to my knowledge).  I know SNS projects benefit from substantial funding, but that funding doesn't come with any strings attached regarding the NNS.  Their situation seems similar to any project that achieves success in a VC funding round.  They likely want to focus on next steps to achieve their promised goals on their roadmap and don't feel incentivized to contribute to the NNS in very significant ways.  Perhaps I'm missing something about why SNS projects might respond to this call to action in ways that non-SNS projects haven't so far.  

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:22129"]
the concept of “SNS Foundation Named Neurons”
[/quote]

I'm having trouble understanding this concept fully.  Are you proposing an SNS Foundation?  Or is it a Named Neuron made of leaders of each SNS?  The latter is a pretty cool idea in my opinion if there is any interest among the SNS teams.  I would recommend making sure control of the neuron is fully decentralized, which can only be achieved today if it is created using command line.  I suppose the policy could be that each SNS team gets to nominate one voting member, which means you could have participation from up to 15 SNS teams.  Anyway, I'm not sure if this is what you have in mind when you talk about a SNS Foundation Named Neurons.  Perhaps you are just advocating for each SNS to also create a named neuron for the NNS, which also seems like a good idea.

When you talk about SNS Foundation and sustainable funding, are you suggesting that each SNS should donate funds to create a foundation?  I guess I'm still having trouble understanding why this should be a SNS project responsibility.  It seems decentralization should be the goal of all NNS participants and funding to achieve it should be sourced from all NNS participants.  I don't really see how volunteer contributions (time or money) is a sustainable model.

Anyway, I hope this forum topic produces a civilized exchange of ideas.  Thanks again for starting the conversation.

It's been over two years, so they must be happy with DFINITY as their followee 🤗. There are plenty of choices now and I'm sorry these people are not doing what you want 😥. They can choose who ever they like and this makes me happy 😊.

He follows the same pattern.  Finds something innocuous and makes a big drama out of it to serve some agenda.  He's not the only one either.

Part of the reason I fight back is because I was in a seed investor telegram group for a year or so.  Every single person there parrotted the same meme that "Dominic's tweets are destroying the ICP price."  Even people I'd known for 5+ years were drinking the Arthur/Artia/Cedric kool-aid.

Go forward a year and we've got a "Dominic should stop tweeting" proposal made by Isaac who works for Cedric, then a ridiculous "ethos" proposal.

These guys are constantly looking for a way to undermine the foundation, it's stupid and it's a distraction to the people building the IC.

I am, however, building the biggest game in the world (non profit) and have been doing so for 11 years and anybody who messes with my plan had better lawyer up.  Especially those that try and poach my lead developer.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-08-16 11:18:15 UTC | #11

Time will tell.

In the meantime just keep your eyes open for multiple people all pushing the same narrative.  Usually that means there's somebody manipulating them.

I am totally for other organisations contributing towards the Internet Computer, I just want them to be doing it for the right reasons.  

When a group of people have been trying to wrest control of the initial three seed neurons for a year before genesis and are pushing the narrative that Dom is "poisoning" the ecosystem, no.. I don't want them anywhere near the IC REGARDLESS of what they say they're capable of.

I have 2 years of chat logs that show exactly what's going on.

EDIT: I mean manipulate all the seed investors into following the initial three seed Neurons and then infiltrate those organisations to gain control.

Good morning Wenzel, thanks for taking the time to put your thoughts together & responding. I think there have been quite a few misconceptions in your understandings of my post, so I’m going to try to clarify my opinion a bit;

[quote="wpb, post:7, topic:22129"]

[/quote]

It’s not a question about “should” they be or not. I’d agree that everyone “should” be incentivized to make code-based contributions.

This is simply pointing out the fact that they have the pre-existing incentives of hundreds of thousands of ICP in fundraising (in most cases), and a dApp thats existence is ultimately governed by the NNS (given the fact that only the NNS can execute certain changes on SNS Canisters). 

When the NNS is centralized, it is a platform risk for anybody developing on it. 

If we shouldn’t be looking to those who have built with the IC, been vetted by DFINITY & the Community, and received the blessing of hundreds of thousands of $ICP in funding, to contributing to alleviating these concerns - where should we look? 

It seems as though there is a recurring theme that we should remain compliant & reliant upon DFINITY. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:5, topic:22129"]

[/quote]

Meaning, if any SNS Foundations were to resonate with this call to action - the scope of their contribution is up to them entirely. Whether that be simply voting on Governance & SNS Proposals, verifying Replicas, or contributing to building & maintaining cutting edge features of the IC - it’s entirely their choice. 

The goal is simply to spark interest in contribution.

While a “committee” of SNS Foundation Leaders does sound like an interesting idea, this is not what I had originally considered an “SNS Foundation Named Neuron”. 

I am putting out the concept of each individual SNS Foundation creating their own Named Neuron, to represent their own individual interests as a Foundation developing a dApp on the Internet Computer.

Meaning, in an optimal world, each SNS Foundation would have their own Named Neuron, contributing to the governance of the Internet Computer in a form that they deem appropriate & feasible. 

[quote="wpb, post:7, topic:22129"]
When you talk about SNS Foundation and sustainable funding, are you suggesting that each SNS should donate funds to create a foundation?
[/quote]

I’m not sure if you’ve been following SNS launches, but this is already what happens - many SNS Sales have earmarked a portion of the treasury to funding the core teams “Foundation”.

I’m not suggesting that this method is employed - however I am saying given it is, these Foundations have the feasibility to dedicate minimal resources to contributing to the NNS in a manner they deem reasonable. 

They’re building a protocol, inherently intertwined with & reliant on not only the Internet Computer, but the NNS itself; therefor the opportunity to minimize platform risk provides great benefit to the longevity of the dApp. 

[quote="wpb, post:7, topic:22129"]

I’d agree that decentralization should be the goal of all NNS participants - but it quite clearly is not. This is a well documented issue within these forums. 

It also seems like this is another subtle attempt to push the narrative of the necessity of an NNS Treasury. 

As such, you should note that this is not a volunteer contribution - SNS Foundations are directly rewarded for any contribution through the mitigation of platform risk & potentially via the SNS Treasury itself for their work - as it directly pertains to the longevity & development of the dApp itself.

As we discussed on twitter, there’s a few reasons for this;

1. People are truly content with DFINITY utilizing their voting power (I’m not saying this is unlikely, however I am saying we need to provide a choice).
 
2. There are no other code based contributors (aside from the rare exception of the Replica topic) . No matter where anybody assigns their neuron as a followee, it gets reassigned to DFINITY in the end. This is due to the fact that we’ve switched to a Voting Based Reward system, and now force participation or penalize APY.

3. People simply haven’t checked their NNS since Genesis. We are in the middle of a bear market. 

There’s simply no accurate way to gauge which. 

However, you can accurately measure the quantity of options; 1. 

There needs to be more options available in an environment that forces participation.

This is the definition of schizo posting.

I don’t even have a telegram - I had to make an account to contact the EMC Protocol for DD & deleted it shortly after. 

And again, I’ve never spoken to or interacted with **any** of the people you’ve named. 

I’m pretty sure you’re also referring to a proposal that was made with https://nnsproposal.icp.xyz/ - I don’t believe @aiv was the author of it, just the creator of the dApp. 

You’re acting like this is some type of “coordinated assault” - but again, I have no interaction with **any** of these people in any form outside of public forum discussions. I simply speak on issues that I find to be detrimental to the core values of the Internet Computer. 

I find it hilarious that you’ve resulted to legal threat over people pursuing the decentralization of a network (where did I see this before🤔). I’m not building a game, nor trying to poach your developer either. You sound quite literally insane.

As @Accumulating.icp, that spam proposal about Dom's tweets was just sent from the dapp I built, I didn't send it.

I created the NNS Proposal submission dapp as part of a DFINITY bounty, and it was the first dapp that gave anyone the ability to anonymously publish a proposal without coding (CLI) knowledge. There was a wave of spam proposals after it launched as people gave it a try.

At the time I hadn't even interviewed for my job at Code & State yet, and I was between jobs so I wouldn't have wasted 10 ICP to troll Dom. More than that, I have complete respect for Dom, ICP wouldn't even exist without him so I owe him my livelihood!

Also, Arthur is very vocal, but he's got nothing to do with Cedric, Artia, or Code & State. They all know each other but Arthur also knows a lot of other ex-DFINITY people. He's also not really active in the ICP ecosystem anymore.

I'm not even active on the ICP Maximalist Telegram group, and I didn't even know Cedric back then, what evidence do you have other than "yeah there was a lot of FUD and I think you somehow were behind it".

For one thing, if Code & State was that good at organizing a community we'd have a lot more engagement on our channels than we do now, we get like a couple comments per week on our Whatsapp groups right now (we're working on it). Frankly, we wouldn't even have even had the reach required to pull off what you're accusing us of if we had wanted to.

It sounds like the spam proposal just sparked a bunch of trolls, but who cares? There's always trolls, they accomplish nothing but making noise. Ignore them, you're building something awesome!

If there was anyone fanning the flames it was probably one of the many ICP trolls who are active on Twitter, or maybe an industry rival like FTX was still playing games back then.

Anyways, this is a baseless accusation, Code & State has not and would never troll Dom on some random group chat. That's ridiculous!

I saw through the BS.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-08-16 16:38:45 UTC | #28

Last I seen, Arthur’s Neuron had 6%, while Synapse had 4%. 

Arthur’s 6% of followee voting power was then assigned as a followee to the Synapse neuron (Im unaware if this is still the case at present day).

Regardless, as stated abundantly within this thread, Arthur is not a member of Code&State, so I’m not sure where the relevance is.

As a side note, I find it beyond ironic that you’re okay with DFINITY self-assigning 100% of voting power to themselves upon Genesis - and we should simply accept it because people “choose” to follow them. 

Yet you find issue in seed investors knowingly choosing to allocate voting power to Arthur’s Neuron?

It seems like you just don’t want any power to slip from DFINITYs grasps.

They had a choice of three, and it was called “cycle_dao” at the time. Since the seed round was about 25% of the voting power (more because of the age bonus), it’s not surprising at all that these three initial choices have a lot of clout
[/quote]

So in essence, you’re telling me you agree & resonate with my proposal to reset followees, given the monopolized state of Named Neurons at the time of introduction of the system? 

I should have just explained it like this to you to begin with. Sucks that every time I phrase it like that, Im “attacking” the network though.

ICDevs - you joined and now they vote against the foundation at any opportunity
Synapse - mostly ok but a few members have recently switched their voting habits.
Arthur - we know what he’s like
[/quote]

**ICDevs** - They don't vote against the foundation, they just have to be careful since they are a non-profit based in the USA so they are forced to vote no on SNS proposals. I personally vote yes on NNS proposals. @skilesare makes sure he gives people time to vote to adopt before the neuron has to vote no. Austin also works for Orygin, which to my understanding has an excellent relationship with the foundation.

**Synapse** - They still have some DFINITY staff members I believe, and no one from Code & State has any involvement. @wpb and I have even gotten into public disagreements on this forum. There's been some drama around Synapse, but I think that's just because people feel strongly on the topics.

**Arthur** (could someone tag him I forgot his handle) - He helped me with the Ethos Proposal, which came of out a sub group in the Governance Working group that DFINITY hosts. Him and I get along but we don't agree on everything, and I've told him before that I think he uses inflammatory language which isn't helpful. He speaks for himself. I think he stopped being active, so his neuron is now just following the ICDevs.org neuron and it doesn't even direct much voting power anymore.

What future do you want for the NNS? If a few neurons gain a following and don't vote exactly like DFINITY, isn't that exactly what the NNS was created for and simply a sign that it's beginning to gain community adoption?

The NNS is not DFINITY **against** the community, it's DFINITY **plus** the community. We all want to see the NNS flourish and gradually diversify, hosting a wide range of participants. Making completely baseless accusations, rooted in paranoia and fear, is not helpful to DFINITY or anyone.

At the end of the day, we are all on the same side and want the same things:

1. For ICP to flourish.
2. For no one organization or person to be in control of the network.

Since a decentralized network has no value if it's not actually decentralized, both goals must be met at the same time. A conspiracy to grab control of a decentralized network is an oxymoron, because by doing that you'd be destroying the value of what you took over since it would be centralized.

I doubt anyone is idiotic enough to attempt this, and again you have absolutely no evidence for the FUD you're spreading.

This is ironic, considering this exact forum topic is in regards to *other alternative contributors* beginning to contribute to the governance of the IC. 

To which you swiftly interjected this “power grab” conspiracy, obviously in attempt to scare people from engaging with this concept (at a time when there wasn’t even anybody indicating interest - who are you accusing of the power grab..?).

Anybody reading this dialogue can see through your act of “pro-decentralization” - you just want the people you like to maintain absolute control.

Yes, I worked with Arthur on the Ethos Proposal. Those tweet were from December 2022, I didn't even start working for Code & State until January 2023. The Ethos proposal had nothing to do with Code & State or Cedric.

Arthur and I were working on the Ethos proposal, which was an assignment that came out of the Governance Working group which DFINITY hosts. I originated the idea, and Arthur helped be with editing and and sharing on Twitter since he had more followers than me.

I'm proud of the work I did on that proposal, it was an honest attempt to help bolster more trust in the NNS. The proposal was rejected though, so the NNS spoke and I dropped the issue.

Code & State has never pushed any anti-foundation narratives, there's no motives, evidence, or basis for that claim. Why would that even make sense? We all need DFINITY to keep building the protocol, hurting DFINITY would be hurting everyone.

This ecosystem is very small, everyone knows everyone. Where you see some broad organized conspiracy, it's just a bunch of independent actors who happen to know each other because they are all active within the same small Web3 niche.

Again, happy to clear the air on a private phone call or even a public Twitter Space. We've got nothing to hide, and we're all on the same side and wanting to see ICP succeed!

Thyassa | 2023-08-16 17:32:52 UTC | #44

I think the issue is that Dfinity can develop far more than just the protocol. There is no need to put people in little boxes. IC is quite possibly greatest innovation since internet. It exists because of Dfinity. Just let everyone build whatever they can and the whole community will benefit.

Accumulating.icp | 2023-08-16 17:36:10 UTC | #45

I don’t think anybody is trying to detract from that at all within this thread.

I am putting out the concept of each individual SNS Foundation creating their own Named Neuron, to represent their own individual interests as a Foundation developing a dApp on the Internet Computer.
[/quote]

This will happen organically in 3-4 years. Once projects on the IC start generating revenue, it will be in their interest to monitor the changes which may break them. IC projects currently have to focus on becoming profitable, providing value to users & inventing things. They can't spend resources on auditing IC code changes before that.
Otherwise... The code NNS governs is a product of hundreds of specialists in their field. If we assign one person per SNS who can understand all that to the last intricate detail. These geniuses (if they can be found at all) will cost a lot and will need to have a large stake or be employed by someone with a large stake. And after a year of hard work, their only product will be decentralization & security.
And if you have these guys, wouldn't they contribute more to your DAO while working on your project

-------------------------

aiv | 2023-08-16 22:10:56 UTC | #50

Yeah I basically agree.

This emerging industry on ICP has to develop, mature, and bring in revenue from outside industries. As that happens I think a lot of these other types of issues will clear up themselves over time.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-08-16 22:29:47 UTC | #51

I’m surprised everyone has taken such an adversarial stance on this topic. To be quite honest, I thought more independent contributors to the Internet Computer was what we are striving for.

I’d agree that this is something that probably will occur naturally over time - but I don’t think that means we should be discouraging people from taking on that responsibility in the meantime. 

I’d also agree everyone has a different level of expendable time available to commit to contributing to the IC, however, I don’t think these blanket statements are accurate or representative of everyone on the IC, let alone SNS Foundations who are typically working full-time on the IC. 

Additionally, I’m not recommending any specific level of contribution - I think any new named neurons are a benefit, whether they’re simply voting on governance / sns topics, verifying replicas, or contributing to the codebase of the IC itself.

I think this is something that everyone should determine individually, - being the appropriate level of contribution from them - as again, this lays the groundwork for foundations to avert platform risk long term. 

Obviously you won’t be able to immediately source world-class talent. But if SNS Foundations are trustworthy & talented enough to entrust hundreds of thousands of ICP with in exchange for their work, why are they not good enough to contribute to the NNS & IC itself? I would argue the SNS dApp they develop full-time is the “employer with a large stake”. I’d also argue they inherently have a large stake, being the dApp itself. 

I thought decentralization & security was the goal? Is that not a meaningful byproduct of their work?

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:51, topic:22129"]

[/quote]

I think the goal is to build a decentralized organization that has a lot higher transparency and censorship resistance than others. Do we have a list of banned/deleted apps hosted on Google, Amazon, or Microsoft? I don't think they are publishing these. They are probably hundreds per hour. If the NNS deletes something, that will be visible to everyone. The cloud mentioned can also alter anything without a trace, the NNS can not.
The NNS code updates are also following governance proposals. If stakeholders are unhappy with a code update, they can propose for it to be reverted. If Dfinity doesn't do it, someone else will. So even with 100% code voting power, the foundation can only push unwanted code for a few days. The whole reverting thing won't be pretty, but the stakeholders, no matter who they were following will manage to enforce their will.

Let's take a look at what's required from a person to be able to vote on code changes:

There are many organizations fighting each other while changing web browsers daily. Each has its own implementation. To be able to write something that works in a web browser securely is an art form (because it's a crazy mess). Using its latest features and keeping up with all changes requires a very narrow-focused specialist.

You will also need someone who has been specializing in Rust and Web assembly and understands all of the craziness on a lower level. And that person has to be familiar with the ICP protocol and all NNS-controlled canisters, CDK, and all libraries used.

Someone who understands the hardware used, secure enclaves, networking, other Internet protocols, operating systems, and such.

A cryptographer/mathematician who summons secure algorithms from thin air.

A failure in any of these will result in total failure of the whole system.

Let's see what SNS DAOs may require (just a guess, not a definitive guide to it)
Entrepreneurs who can understand humans and find a way to imagine & facilitate products for them. Developers who can use what is available to create these products. Usually, these developers will rarely write their own libraries. They are mostly trying to make sure they provide features users want. Then there are also developers who are helping with bringing users in and working on marketing. Ofc we are not talking about something novel like MidJourney, but even then, these developers will be focusing on making that novel software that has nothing to do with anything else.

I believe the intricacy and depth are far greater than what meets the eye.

Well I was just commenting on how I thing things will end up getting to where we want them, but yeah the sooner we get there the better!

It would be great to see SNS project teams supporting protocol development sooner rather than later, and DSCVR has already done exciting work on the edge network thing, which seems nearly at the level of protocol contribution.

A bit of context is missing here. The thread was about NEW projects getting built on the IC https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-promising-projects-on-ic/20777
The 4 ones were trending on twitter and getting attention by the community. I also asked anyone to add to the list if they know any other project, and as you can see Dragginz was mentioned. 
As far as I knew according to : https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dragginz-a-virtual-world-on-dfinity/836 you were already working on it since Jul 2020, so it was not new that is all. I am happy to support the Dragginz project in any shape or form possible and the same goes for any app on the IC.

BoomDao I see having huge potential if they continue the work they are doing but in my opinion its not ready yet for the SNS.

Yet Voting Power is centralized & we censor via NNS & Nodes, so all we have is transparency.

It is disingenuous to say NNS Code Updates abide Governance Proposals. Governance Proposals are nothing more than glorified polls, there is no weight or execution correlated to them unless DFINITY decides they like the proposal.

This is showcased within the Followee Reset Topic, in which the NNS came to a consensus that a Followee Reset is beneficial (one of the opening statements is that its core purpose is furthering decentralization - I don’t want to hear the “that proposal was about something else!!” excuse), and DFINITY decided it wouldn’t be beneficial for them to execute, as they’d lose their 99%+ super majority. 

I, and many other stakeholders were unhappy with this & it was pursued in forums & within proposals for months to follow - all of which DFINITY decided to shut down & reject. Is it possible not enough people care? Maybe. It’s also just as likely not enough people look at the NNS & Forums anymore.   

This Followee environment has created passive NNS participants who had their voting power assigned for them, or manually assigned it (there’s also no measure to the quantity that felt forced to remain a followee to maintain APY), enabling a set & forget mindset leading to centralized control.

In theory your idea sounds nice, but in reality, it doesn’t happen.

Within your statement, you’re trying to generalize all code based topics under one umbrella, implying that any level of governance contribution requires all of the following skills. 

This quite simply is not the case; please refer to CodeGov - they have a range of developers verifying replicas on a weekly basis, each with varying experience.

Additionally, I’m going to stress again - I’ve recommended that each Foundation reviews internally, and makes a responsible decision in regards to the contributions they’re willing to make. I’m not saying people should propose replicas, but it would be helpful if there were more people blessing them. 

Each scenario will result in a different quality & quantity of contribution - that’s natural.

While you have a fair point in regards to entrepreneurs driving SNS DAOs rather than developers, I think you’re severely downplaying the developers of these dApps & those within our ecosystem. Most SNS DAO Foundations have decades+ of industry experience & business acumen.

Regardless, should we not be aiming for more contributors & helping amend mistakes rather than shutting out contributors for the potential they make mistakes? It seems like an expedited route to an echo chamber when nobody other than the DFINITY Foundation is good enough to contribute.

@Accumulating.icp
I feel that we do need to talk about many of the topics that have been outlined here but I would like to add that following is all I need at this point as most of the updates to this project needs on the NNS and SNS are better in the hands of the DFINITY team with it’s many brilliant team members and not in the hands of neuron owners like @borovan who recently sent me a personal message. 

Sorry @borovan, just Delete it, if you want to show your other face then write it here on the forum.

As for the SNS I would like to see less information within the ICP forum and contained within the SNS project itself. 

Let's not forget that anyone can build on the IC and a neuron owner can support any project on the SNS and we as NNS neuron owners should not give a view even if it is a rug pull.

While DFINITY has built it, what has come to the SNS has been a disappointment for me so far but I see @borovan has been an early contributor to most and then gives financial advice.

Let the SNS projects do their own thing and not interfere, sounds like a pumper and dumper to me. 

**Just to be the Devil's advocate** 
What would you suggest as a need or change to the NNS or SNS or maybe a list of changes that we should consider before DFINITY gives control to Neuron owners so we have the discussion before waiting till the last minute and maybe a list of changes that we should follow through, ready for that day.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-08-25 19:28:11 UTC | #57

I could not disagree more, knowing many of the projects that have come to SNS and what they are trying to build.  You cannot expect a finished product to do an SNS raise.  

Its like saying in 1995 that all websites are bad and the internet is going nowhere as everything looks like ass and has far too many flame effects :fire: :fire: :fire:
