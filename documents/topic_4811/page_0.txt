Some applications may rely on the system-level canisters, such as the ledger canister, cycles minting canister, internet identity, etc. I'm trying to write a deploy script that can help deploy these canisters to setup a local development environment automatically for developers.

I only managed to successfully deploy the ledger canister and the internet identity, are there any instructions or documents on how to deploy these canisters?
