## Summary

We want to add more community tooling, SDK, agents into the documentation. Make a PR to add a project.

## Intro 
One of the things my team has been working on is improving websites and documentation. One of the things on that list is doing a better job of incorporating community SDKs, tooling, etc...

As a first step, we restructured developer documentation to make it much easier for people to add their own language SDKs into the documentation. We restructured Agents and SDKs so that community can add more languages and tooling. To give a concrete example:, Demergent labs can add Azle (and subsequent tutorials) for TypeScript.

## How to add an SDK or Agent

Make a pull request in the docs!

Since this is a first step, my only ask is that folks please keep PRs about adding tooling and tutorials to *this section* for now while patterns emerge.

## Other places where community can repos, tools, etc...

There are other places that also exist, including the IC wiki: 

* https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_wiki

As an example, I added multiple community tools for ICP custody: [https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/ICP_custody_options](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/ICP_custody_options).

Thanks for the ping @lastmjs , I just approved! Need an approval from another CODEOWNER (from SDK since it touches their parts), but i expect it should be merged and deployed soon.
