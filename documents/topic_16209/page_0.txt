What I think Dfinity should do is to make questlines like Optimism and Arbitrum is doing on eth. With quests that gives NFTs that can sell for up to 10 dollars worth of ICP depending on how long the questline is. For example: add liquidity to ICP-USD for 1-2 weeks. And maybe a potential airdrop if a user complete 20 quests. This is a very popular way that I see also Aptos is doing right now. It is also possible and link the user IC-Wallet to their discord/Twitter account and/or even also make a NFT with your passport information integrated to filter out botters/multiple accounts. 

What is your thoughts on this? In my opinion this will be a great market strategy!
