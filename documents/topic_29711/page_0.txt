<h2>Status of ap-coe NFT collection</h2>
One year has passed since the start of the COE project. Last year on this date, the COE project plan was being written and conceptualized. A year ago on this date we were planning to build and distribute ap-coe NFTs in the first phase.
A collection of ap-coe NFTs built with little investment from the team. An economic plan to grow the community that was able to generate income and entertainment for more than 500 wallets.

* Today, as of this writing, the ap-coe NFT collection has distributed over 9,800 NFTs.
* Today, the ap-coe NFT collection has 4858 holders
* 2222 successful transactions in the chain
* Generated free income for 590 wallets
* 388.93 ICP had a financial turnover
* It has 130 investors
* Over 9,800 NFTs are freely distributed to the community and only 301 NFTs are for sale

At the time of writing this report, more than 68% of ap-coe NFT holders hold only one NFT. 18.18% of holders hold only 2 NFTs. This means that more than 80% of the holders of this project hold less than 3 NFTs.
Currently, the price of this NFT is much lower than its original value. Each NFT is worth 42 COE tokens.

<h3>How to check ap-coe NFTs data?</h3>
One of the best ways to check the status of the ap-coe collection is to use the NFTgeek tool and platform. After logging in, you can easily enter ap-coe name in the search section and check and analyze all the important and required data.
**Let's explore this very important point of ap-coe NFTs as a fully airdropped collection.**

<h2>COE token status</h2>
The COE token is the only token in the ICP ecosystem that does not yet have a direct trading pair with ICP. It has been almost 7 months since the creation of the first liquidity pool between COE/BABYAROF. This liquidity pool was formed as a result of a bilateral cooperation and the LP document of this pool has been burned.
Recently, after the launch of ICS tokens, the COE project created the second liquidity pool of this token with ICS. In this cash pool, 1% of the cash volume of COE tokens is loaded. The LP document of this liquidity pool is also burned and decentralized. The growth of COE token transactions can reduce the liquidity of BABYAROF and ICS tokens.

COE token is currently floating between two major trading pairs. Both BABY AROF and ICS tokens use token-burning structure for value growth, which can clarify the prospect of COE token's dollar value in the long term. 

To date, COE token has less than 100 real investors, and most of these investors were large and early holders of BABYAROF. COE token has brought 2409 successful transactions in the chain to date. The cost of charging the can of this token is provided by the transaction fee of ap-coe collection.

<h3>A deeper look at the COE token</h3>
The COE token has specified in its roadmap that until the ICP/COE pool is created, all capital injection for this token will be done through BABYAROF/COE trading pair. In this way, after opening the first traditional business or completing each of the sp-coe stages, we can see the financial input from the BABYAROF/COE pair. 

Every time capital enters from this trading pair, the arbitrage route for the COE token will be activated and we can expect an increase in transactions from other trading pairs.

<h2>First Business Status (FOODCOE)</h2>
One of the main goals of the COE project is the development and integration of new traditional businesses. The COE team has been researching this idea for more than 1.5 years. The creation and integration of traditional businesses is planned to be funded collectively, but with the aim of field research in the traditional market in the form of a two-way collaboration, BABYAROF project and COE have implemented the first traditional business plan.
A small fast food restaurant called FOOD COE that will use blockchain tools in its marketing and advertising department. FOOD COE has written its development plan and created its collection of NFTs.
In-person customers can become members of the customer club by purchasing from FOOD COE and receive a gift in the form of FOOD COE NFTs. The implementation of this event is done in the simplest possible way so that people who have no knowledge of the cryptocurrency world can easily interact with the cryptocurrency space. The realization of this idea can only be implemented with the help of the ICP blockchain!

10% of the financial input of this small business is spent on purchasing ICP tokens on a daily basis. The collected tokens will be injected into the COE token structure on a monthly basis through the COE/BABYAROF trading pair. Tokens purchased with the help of the claim option in ICPSWAP will be distributed among the NFT holders of the customer club.

All the frameworks set in the COE white paper should be considered for this traditional business. All the marketing and sales data of this business will be made available to the public as an open source so that more people can use the COE plan if they wish.

<h3>Positive effects of the development of FOOD COE</h3>
In the first step, this small business cultivates the idea of using ICP blockchain tools among traditional businesses among the community. It can also introduce many people to the world of digital currencies, and this introduction will start from the ICP blockchain.
Also, this traditional business can introduce more than 500 new real people to the ICP ecosystem on an average monthly basis. FOOD COE plans a simple educational path for new audiences so that any real person can communicate with the vital platforms of the ecosystem in the simplest possible way.

In our research, it has been proven that the cost of feed advertising on social networks such as Instagram is much cheaper than other target markets. This can show a good perspective in the advertising section of the COE project.

Until now, the BABYAROF team has spent a lot of capital on this project. 3.3 million BABY AROF tokens are locked in the cash pool to use the COE scheme. Also, up to now more than 185 ICPs at an average price below $10 have been spent on the development and construction of the FOOD COE.

At this stage, after voting in the DAO section of the COE project, it is planned to sell the initial shares of FOOD COE at the price of 0.46 ICP.
Only in-person customers can receive FOOD COE NFTs. For this purpose, a maximum of 1000 NFTs are planned for international sale so that all interested people can help and participate in the development of this idea.
Now, those interested can purchase FOOD COE NFTs through the ICPswap platform.
The executive team believes that with a maximum of 460 ICP capital, this idea can be developed with the highest quality. We request the elders of the ICP community to study and if they approve of the development of this idea, provide the necessary support. We always repeat, create together and for each other.

What are the incentives of buying foodcoe nfts?

Limestonecowboy | 2024-04-15 16:59:30 UTC | #4

In the ways of an NFT supporter? I, personally, would need no other incentive other than having it serve as a contribution to the cause üòÉ
