I don't see anything wrong with temporarily resetting the weighting structure back to 1 while a better solution is found....good intended changes don't always work the way they are meant to work, it happens all the time in real life, so if we have the opportunity of reverting back and fix it why not. Not wanting to revert back and fixing it would be like wanting Boeing to keep flying their 737 MAX with the "improvements" they made until they fix them.  (the original 737 kept flying while they fix the improved ones)

Fortunately for the ICP is only spamms.

I'm not sure why you qualify things this way. I'm proposing to revert to something that was in place for months and worked fine. Also, it is temporary. Secondly, I'm not trying to shoot anyone. @ysyms has done a masterful job exposing a flaw.  I'm just trying to clear the decks. I believe I have more to gain from lack of liquidation than I do from extra rewards from weighting on proposals.  I'm suggesting something I think is in the interest of anyone who wants the ICP price to go up.  I don't want to have to vote on two proposals every day for the next 30 days(or longer).  I have other things to do.

I'm happy to be convinced that falling back is a bad idea.  @wpb has done the best job to date, but I still think a temporary revert stops the spam and lets us get the other good ideas coded.

Delegated staking is used on Cosmos and cosmos chains. The Delegator chooses a Validator based upon available information, which may include a link to the validator's website BUT ALSO, each validator is able to set and take a percentage of the reward they receive for doing the work. 

If a similar system were introduced, persons who, or entities that are fully vested in the Internet Computer's progress could probably turn a tidy profit from undertaking such roles through charging an appropriate commission on the IC.

skilesare | 2022-04-26 15:26:17 UTC | #116

What do you perceive the real stress is? In my opinion, the stress is the unequal weightings of categories when they are all equally important.  Can you make a case that some should be weighted higher than others?  Can you make a case that there is a way that you can fix this while keeping weights in place?  

@wpb makes the case that resetting known neurons is the way to do it, but I think it creates fragility as people no longer follow dfinity and I don't think the network is ready for that fragility.

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-26 15:31:08 UTC | #120

Walk me through your thinking, because I'm not quite sure I understand your point of view.

Let's take stocks for example.  I could buy stock in a company today and the terms of that ownership is free to change throughout the lifetime of my ownership.  The company could (1) pay more or less dividends, (2) change operating models, (3) engage in business deals against my interest, (4) inflate or deflate my ownership (though dilution or buybacks), (5) sell off or purchase major divisions within the company, or a million other things that would change the terms of my investment.  In fact, stocks are even worse than the NNS because none of those five examples even require a shareholder vote in the US... at least everything in the NNS is decided by vote.  In your framework, how are stocks legit, but the NNS is a scam?  I'm truly not understanding how the NNS is any different from any other investment.  Heck, even the terms on my mortgage (which should be the most fixed investments there are) are free to change (although, admittedly within bounds) with no control of myself... my mortgage provider has changed hands twice in the past year without my consent.

Regarding your example of ICDevs giving themselves a million ICP... how would that work?  ICDevs has 8.3% of the vote following them.  Would the remaining 91.7% not vote?  Also remember, ICDevs has that voting power because individual neuron holders have made the conscience decision to allocate their voting power to ICDevs.  That decision was at their free will and they are free to reverse that decision at any time should they disagree with ICDevs voting patterns.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-26 15:40:07 UTC | #121

To clarify, our proposal is for people to confirm their Followee selections and only reset if they don’t confirm within the required timeframe.  People are still free to confirm or select Dfinity or ICA even if their Followee is reset.  My best guess is that people will choose Dfinity when they actively select or reset their Followees assuming Dfinity always votes.

My concern is that you vastly underestimate the number of large investors currently holding the network together by their passive investment. I know some of these people and I know the people that manage their tokens and they wouldn't be following anyone for governance at the moment if I hadn't explicitly reached out and provided instructions(there are a lot more that I don't know).  If 50% of the network only follows dfinity and never reconfirms and Dfinity only holds 24% of the network then we have an issue with at least some overdramatic intrigue that the fledgling network may not be ready for.

I'm not trying to sound overdramatic, but there are sizeable chunks of this network that don't know they are getting rewards, have so much that they won't notice if they stop, and that you or I won't be able to reach to inform them of what is going on.  The network is designed for that to go away eventually, but we're just getting to the End of Epoch 1 and we have 2 more years to go before almost all of the genesis neurons don't have massive sway.  I'd 100% support your position in 2 years. I'm just worried about the effects on the next 1 year.

I was being provocative to state a point that we are centralizing the vote through following 8 percent is pretty high is the point.

[quote="Kyle_Langham, post:120, topic:12390"]

It's the 8 year lock up and lack of readily available information that makes it bad. Dfinity has documentation stating that we get 28% interesting if we lock up for 8 years and that is not true. We probably need to add warning labels all over the NNS that this is not staking and to get gains you are expected to actively take part in governance. 

But honestly my biggest issue with all of this is that we are encouraging governance while simultaneously giving people the ability to follow neurons. So we are essentially encouraging centralization of power to those exposed neurons. 

I also think we are actively gate keeping staking from average people which long term is bad for the health of the ecosystem.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 16:04:17 UTC | #133

In my ICDevs capacity, I'm representing my(and the devs I talk to) best guess view on what is good for the developers in the ecosystem.  Currently, that is a lack of volatility, predictability, and ability to focus on development without having to be overburdened by the governance of a network that DFINITY is doing a fine job piloting.  My desire for ICDevs was, for the immediate future, to follow DFINITY except where we felt that it diverged from the best interest of developers. When dfinity stopped voting, and/or became selective that made that stated goal more difficult.  I'm glad DFINITY launched and I love how far we have come, but I think there is significant tech to build before we wade into the wild wild west of decentralized land.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 16:06:23 UTC | #134

Why is it our responsibility to inform those who have so much that rewards don't matter to them? Don't they, precisely because of their disinterest/disdain, DESERVE not to earn?

darien | 2022-04-26 16:31:50 UTC | #143

but this proposal is a consequence of the original issue which *Voting Participation*
therefore, the issue is being addressed. The reward structure was modified with the intent of incentivizing participation in governance (which is the core purpose of the NNS), the goal is to have as many participants as possible for more decentralization. 
The first attempt worked in achieving the goal partially but exposed a problem, there is nothing wrong with reverting and doing it a little different. 

We want more active participants with no spammers

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-26 16:42:09 UTC | #144

What is spam is the key question. 

Was @wpb 's 30 days of educational motion proposals spam? For me it was, because it was not actionable.  For others, not so much. 

Why is @ysyms proposals considered spam? Because he explicitly calls them as such? What if another attacker creates a set of educational motion proposals and packages them up nicely? 

I would definitely think that we should reward active participants and discourage non-active participants. Further the onus of burden should be on the participants to be active or not; NOT FOR US TO GO THROUGH THIS CIRCUS; to appease non-active participants (who, from most accounts, don't even care whether they get rewards or not).

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 16:49:52 UTC | #145

@wpb and @Kyle_Langham actually the one created me, introduced me through their high annualized article and I think alots of other people too into the NNS, used to be a passive one following other neuron to now independent and vote carefully even everyday by myself and now seeing people accusing @ysyms as a spammer without seeing the bigger picture that he brought that's why I'm here voicing myself to the injustice and opposing this proposals that super unfair to the one that active.

I don't disagree.  The bad example I can think of is it is like processing nutrients through the digestive system.  We need to get it out, but there is a process. You don't want to cut into the stomach and remove it from there.  Sometimes you just have to wait for the body to do its thing. It will come out eventually. They served a massive purpose. They funded the platform when it was a drawing on a napkin.  If they don't convert their nutrients into muscle and bone by giving a damn then they will eventually be excreted out of the system.

I think you want people to think that taking an extraordinary risk for your platform results in a long train of positive feedback and rewards.  We are financing their risk/reward ratio at the moment. It is programmed to be phased out. It is much better than the corporate model where you are stuck with inactive investors forever. You have to promise some reward or the original risk won't be taken and you have to honor the reward or people won't trust you the next time.

Whoa this snowballed.

a reset is the obvious choice. It gives us time to produce an actual long term solution.

I am already seeing some great ideas out here. We need time and i mean a long off (4 months is a good amount) time to fully discuss a permanent solution. To replace to following.

Two things we need to consider:

Rewards engine - if we want to keep the weighted rewards it should be done in a way that does not reinforce malicious behaviors. @justmythoughts has a pretty good solution.

Spam filtration - wether governance rewards are increased or reset, spam will still be a problem. We need a way to control spam without taking away from the open democracy of the current NNS. We must define the core values that we want for the NNS and 

Both of these must work in conjunction. Whats the point of setting up spam filters when individuals are inventivized to spam.

The fact is the current governance rewards model is highly exploitable. Especially for the larger neurons. Its a gaping hole. We are giving ourselves time to create a solid decentralized system. Trial and error is a basis of all human accomplishment.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 17:15:24 UTC | #156

THE NNS is the governance one, please remember

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 17:53:16 UTC | #157

We incentivize real active voters not passive stakers so better build another one so that we could create another value for the network through tokenizing that because the NNS is the governance non tokenize dapp

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 17:21:17 UTC | #158

or maybe the ICP is the alr tokenize NNS, but we need a separate entity between passive and active in my opinion.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-26 17:22:09 UTC | #159

I don't begrudge them that (financing their risk) Yes, they have taken extraordinary risk for which they should be rewarded) ; but hopefully they were accredited (or similarly educated). 

Therefore i assume they knew that NNS was a living breathing thing whose changes they would need to monitor to gain their rewards.

In short, my beef is with the fact that why we spend ANY IOTA of time thinking (or acting) about what they would think about what rewards they are not getting and how to appease them. Yes, i have gone through the article you posted on the experiment conducted. I am not sure whether the short timespans apply in this context(4+ years at least).

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-26 17:35:56 UTC | #162

I’ve seen you make similar points before, but still haven’t fully understood what you are trying to say.  Perhaps this latest comment has enough information for me to read between the lines, but please correct me if I’m wrong.  

I think you are saying is that we need passive investors who follow Dfinity because that enables Dfinity to control all non governance decisions (routine business) through liquid democracy.  I think this is a valid concern and I think it does need to be addressed.  I’m surprised this didn’t come up in the deliberation on our [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).  

I think the answer to this concern is simple.  If a neuron has not been voting for a certain small period of time (e.g. a day, week, or month), then that neuron should not be included in the calculation of total voting power in the NNS.  Hence, if a significant fraction of the voting power that is currently not voting on governance continues to not vote on anything because they don’t confirm their Followees, the the total voting power must become smaller than it is currently.  That makes Dfinity total voting power go up significantly, which means they will still have the ability to execute proposals for routine, non governance topics by absolute majority.  

When neuron owners do finally decide that they will select and confirm their Followees, then their neuron can start collecting voting rewards again.  Nobody is trying to stop this from happening.  It is important to communicate these changes widely so people are aware of changes.

From my perspective, I’m not trying to take voting rewards from others.  Instead, I want to use the voting rewards as incentives (I believe they are designed for this purpose) to motivate people to participate by some minimum definition of active participation.  If this doesn’t happen, then we can’t achieve decentralization.  As mentioned several times before, there are other actions required to achieve that decentralization, but proposal weights are central to achieving the goal in my opinion.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 17:39:57 UTC | #163

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 17:42:00 UTC | #164

I don't think this is achieving decentralization in any way. I think we would be far more decentralized if we remove following feature and make all staking passive. Right now all we have achieved is centralization towards exposed neurons.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 17:49:27 UTC | #165

@alejandrade Passive should be tokenize and creating value for the network with their activities exemple building another protocol that could be tokenize, or be locked elsewhere that could tokenize and at the same time creating value for the network, increase the network effect for the system rather than locked and being no useful inside the NNS.

I don’t really understand this logic.  Would you please clarify further?  

I do agree that we don’t have enough public known neurons.  I think that’s one of the next biggest issues that needs to be resolved.  Again, if it were up to me I would use tokenomic incentives to drive toward more public known neurons.  I really haven’t given too much thought to how to achieve that yet, but I think @skileshare has presented an interesting idea in another thread.  

I guess I would tend to argue against the idea that we are not moving toward decentralization.  It is a work in progress and we have a long way to go, but I believe significant progress is being made.

Maybe im misunderstanding, but none of this actually increases or decreases any neuron's VP or the total VP of the NNS. Even if those neurons aren't following another neuron their VP is still being tallied in the total. Right?

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 18:01:00 UTC | #170

Forcing governance through tokenomics isn't increasing decentralization. 

People who don't want to vote will never vote they will always delegate their votes. When they delegate their votes they are giving power to the exposed neurons centralizing power to them. 
If tokenomics where not incentivizing people to vote then those people currently giving exposed neurons power would not vote therefore decentralizing voting power to people that actually want to vote. 


Meaning all these tokenomics are doing is giving exposed neurons more power and the normal person that want to vote less power

Even if those neurons aren’t following another neuron their VP is still being tallied in the total. Right?

Yes, this is correct currently.  My argument is that inactive voting power (neurons that have not voted in the last x days), should not be included in the calculation of total voting power.  Once they start voting again (they have voted on the last y proposals or they have voted for the last z days), then their voting power should start being included in the total voting power calculation again and they should start receiving voting rewards again.  I think we need to consider an approach like this because there is an important utility for Dfinity to be able to execute absolute majority on routine business proposals.  It may not be needed though because we are really close to having 50% of total voting power actively participating.  New tokenomics incentives and advertising may push us beyond that absolute majority threshold that is needed.

try to avoid the stress test through this proposal for the short period of time instead of solving the real problem that concern the future potential of real attacker with non reward incentivize but straight up into destroying our governance system. Ridiculous

Caring about those who vote with feets and try to discourage those who vote with brain, funny

exposed neurons.

Do you mean, neurons managed by people/entities that are known?

I'm not a fan of excluding neurons from the VP calculation. I understand your reasoning; but, if Dfinity was concerned about losing the ability to push hotfixes then they should address that in a more transparent manner. Otherwise, if this is truly an open protocol, governed by the users, then they should have faith in the community to follow and support them on those proposal types.

I think any neuron that has the right to vote should be included in the tally. Otherwise, we lose transparency. I can only imagine how many skewed interpretations of the data will be thrown around:

"Look at our voter participation, it's up to %95." Sure, but only because we changed the definition of voter participation.

Isn’t this open governance where a neuron can follow any neuron?

Disappointed with the NNS

NNS would jeopardise itself by resetting followers before suffering a decrease in the short term financial gains, earned through siphoning the rewards from other unaware neurons.

Why did the foundation vote no?

l'm glad that this proposal didn't pass. We (the active ones) are getting more out of the same exact pie . Sure, there are spams .. but i'm sure there will be a solution in coming months. 

Some thoughts... How did the weight change proposal pass in the first place ? Is it really well thought enough ? One shouldn't assume that all of us are good actors .. Bad actor creating spam proposals must have been brought up before but nonetheless it pass ! Let's just keep moving forward/improving and not result to reverting.

What about Something like: 

Active voter: 1 reward
Passive 1/4 reward 

Own vote: 1 
Followee vote for you, you recieve: 1/4 reward and the followee recieve 1/4 of your voting power. 

1 and 1/4 is just an example don’t know the exact statistics about how to compensate Avtive and passiv
And at the same time giving less power to “big neurons” that create monopoly.
