I’ve created a neuron to make a proposal to reduce the weighting of a governance proposal back to 1.

Objective: Eliminate the spam incentive on the NNS until a better solution can be implemented.

Proposal: Reduce the weight of governance proposals to 1 until September 1st 2022 at which point it will revert to 20.

Note: if we solve it sooner we can always vote to revoke this.

I’d like to raise the funds to submit this proposal. When the following neuron gets 10 ICP I’ll submit it. If it passes I’ll merge the neuron with the ICDevs neuron.

Why temporarily? What can change in the next couple months?

-------------------------

For now, reducing the governance proposal weight to 1 would eliminate the financial incentives to put forth spam proposals (given that the proposal reject cost is also 10 ICP).

In the next couple months we can then have more time to discuss and put forth longer-term fixes for DFINITY to implement that will remove both the financial and visibility (advertisement) incentives for spam. 

For example, changes that remove both of these incentives might look something like this:

* Remove the **financial incentive** by fixing governance rewards on a per week basis - [Community Discussion: Revise Governance Voting Rewards to Fix Proposal Spamming Rewards Exploit](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915)
* Remove the **visibility incentives** for spam by introducing an incubation period where voting is completely voluntary (not attached to rewards) and a minimum support threshold - https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-introduce-an-incubation-period-and-minimum-support-threshold-for-governance-proposals/12220

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-24 20:08:29 UTC | #4

I like https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-incentivize-the-diversification-of-followees-in-the-nns/12237 but it will take time and effort to implement.

[quote="skilesare, post:1, topic:12237"]
2. People can just set up 10 of their own neurons to follow that don’t have influence and have those follow just a few neurons.

Rebuttal: This seems like a lot of work once we have > 10 named neurons in the system. It will be much easier to randomly select neurons from the list.
[/quote]

It's a nice idea, but feel this is a pretty glaring flaw - especially for whales to set 10 lead neurons with fractional (<1 ICP), and then just have each of those lead neurons have a single followee. 

We have to assume that if we erect a barrier and the incentive exists, developers will build bots and tools to dig under that barrier and game the system.

<br/>
...
But back to this specific proposal to reset governance proposal weights and rewards to 1 (as DFINITY originally had it) -> 100% would support this.

I’m theory it is all temporary. We can bit to change or reinstate at any time.  Temporary here because the increased weight did significantly increase participation. We had a bump and I think it has leveled off. We have a new problem now. It is unlikely that participation will go down(I think) and im four months the world will be different and we may want to go from 45% to 75%.

Sorry guys, for me, this is a panic patch solution that, again, the outcome has not been taught in any way and the result may create other problems
The spammer have promised to make only 2 spams per day for  1 month.  Let live with this for now.
If you try to pass this one, good chances the spammer would process all the value he has, maybe more and process 30, 40, more ... proposals in 1 day before this proposal pass.  That would create a mess.
Please do not panick.
It is quiet easy to predict.
The supply does not change, only the distribution for now.
Let's take the right time to do the right things.
Only my opinion.
EDIT:  I should have said 60,70 or more spams proposal may come quickly because of this panic proposal.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-25 12:00:07 UTC | #19

Yeah..I’m not sure what you mean. 1 does not always equal 1 when you include second order consequences. Paying 2 to people paying attention who are looking for short term gains(they will sell right away) and 1 to holders not paying attention can result innover liquidation and driving the price down. Paying 1.5 and 1.5 will result in Less liquidation allowing the price to fall less. If you are 8 year gang there is much more upside in paying equal rewards to whales that will hold then a bunch of smash and grabbers.

I think my math checks out.

This would actually be against their best interest as flooding the market with dilute the rewards and focus them on one days worth of rewards.

As a voter I’d much rather go through and click on 40 proposals at one time then have to go check every day for the next 40 days.

Before it is returned back, minimum 1 week, we may be flooded with spams.  @ysyms is a white spammer and he used a flaw to show the community that there was a flaw.  He always been transparent and have showned his color all the time. He has post some ideas for solution.  Does not mean we have to do everything he propose.  So why creating a confrontation with this by returning to something that was making no sense, the governance proposal having same weight as the exchange rate proposal.  Why not working all together to resolve?

-------------------------

I don't think it should be changed. Governance is one of the most important categories, so the weighing should indeed be high, should serve as an incentive to participate in governance. 

Love or hate the spam proposals, they're making me definitely check the nns daily. i manually vote on whatever is there, not just governance. 

We need people frequently voting. If people can vote independently, without following a neuron, even better because we'll now have individuals voting instead.

If people are too lazy to vote, why should they be rewarded?

Hi Austin,

I sent an ICP to support you making this proposal, however I haven't yet decided on how I'll vote.  On the one hand, I would love to see a solution to this spam issue put in place asap.  On the other hand, it kills me to think that the 600ICP crowdfunding will be pocketed by it's initiator instead of burned.  This is a silly reason, so I'll probably vote in favor of the temporary change.

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-04-25 17:52:01 UTC | #30

@ggf2134 @coteclaude 

The root issue is the weighted governance rewards. To effectively solve a problem you always start with the root cause. @ysyms showed us how changes to the NNS can snowball into larger problems. 

The NNS has a weakpoint, something that can and will be exploited. We are allowed to revert or tweak changes if they did not work out. Thats how evolution works, thats how political systems work. If something does not work you either remove it or go extinct.

This is a social experiment, volatility is implied. We must learn our errors now before mass adoption kicks in. Reverting to original settings is not a panic move. Its a logical one. If your computer isnt working reset, if your strategy isnt working reset, if your program isnt working reset, back to the drawing board. 

We dont need everyone to vote, the NNS is designed to pass proposals even if a low number of neurons vote. We are still early there are only 90,000 neurons voting in existence and many of those are controlled by single entities. The number of people is still very low.

I’m not familiar with the phrase “white spammer” but I think you’re trying to use it in a way that is similar to an ethical (white hat) hacker. I do not agree with this assessment because all the ethical hackers I know would never actively exploit vulnerabilities just to prove their point.

I’ve always understood the term “Governance”, in the context of the NNS, to mean any and all proposal types. I don’t know why there’s so much weight given to the actual governance motion proposals when they do so little. Especially when the vast majority of them don’t have any real development resources allocated to them.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-04-25 18:38:11 UTC | #32

I'm really conflicted on this one, spam proposals are a problem but I don't know if it's worth reverting governance weight to stop it. I agree with the position that people not voting on governance don't deserve to have rewards comparable to those that do. Therefore, I don't like the idea of giving 4 months of evenly distributed rewards to those neurons, if they want to get paid then they need to participate.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-25 19:04:42 UTC | #33

I disagree.  The root cause is default configuration of neuron following for All Topics.  Proposal weights incentivize spam, but they don’t cause it.  The problem exists because there is an imbalance in participation.  Proposal weights have enabled decentralization and are essential to progress of IC governance.  ICP is a governance token and active participation should be expected.

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-04-25 19:41:26 UTC | #34

There has to be a better way to incentivize participation then to allow a rewards exploit to exist. If the root cause is the default configuration of followees. Then Resetting reward balancing makes even more sense. Reset all applied bandaids and only change the root cause.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-25 20:30:39 UTC | #35

Resetting everything from known neuron to reward weight to 1. going back to the old way with only dfinity and ica as the two main followees

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 00:22:14 UTC | #36

Do we really NEED to incentivize governance? When I staked my ICP I didn’t realized I was signing up for a full time job. If the goal is to get people to stake I don’t think we should force them to work.

At this point if it keeps taking more of my time I’m just going to write a bot that auto votes everything with whoever is winning.

[/quote]

I fundamentally disagree that a governance proposal is inherently worth more than an exchange rate proposal.  This idea ignores the reality of black swans.  

One bad XDR to Cycles proposal getting through could wreck the cycle market for decades(see the latest bug where Trillions and Trillions of cycles were produced and thankfully a white hat reported it.). 

What if someone slips in a node reward proposal that gives 100M ICP to a hacker and they liquidate?

No one had any guarantees about what will happen in the future and any one of the categories could be a cause of unquantified harm to the system. We need ALL of them to be decentralized. We should have at least 10 organizations voting on XDR exchange proposals.  

One could argue that we should increase the weight of those proposals to 20x due to the fact that the only voting neurons right now are likely DFINITY and ICA. Most feel they can trust them, but what about an unforeseen bug? It is the same reason the ETH community wants clients written in more than one language by more than one organization.

I will include temporary in the proposal and revert date, but I think the move should be permanent because we need to incentivize the diversification of all categories equally when taking into account second-order consequences and unknown volatility.

We need to benefit from volatility and randomness in this system. In fact, the fastest way to decentralization would be for the NNS to randomly decide the weights on certain days and for the DFINITY FOUNDATION and ICA to not vote. Then you'd really get some interesting behavior!  We are not ready for that yet, but once we have the solid bones of the system in place where we have 10+ independent organizations dedicated to each category it would be a great immune system to put in place.

I don't view it this way.  We needed more governance participation and we got it. We may need to turn the dials some more after another hundred million of ICP has dissolved out of the Genesis neurons. The conceit to up the reward threshold was genius.  It is also now a problem.

I'd argue(and have) that active abstaining and/or delegation is as important, or more important than participation.  Delegation to the DFINITY foundation is a 100% rational choice at the moment. In five years one may want to reconsider, but for now they built the thing and have a very high number of phds running it.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-26 03:03:31 UTC | #40

When people refer to the value of exchange rate proposals vs governance proposals, they are referring to the amount of time and effort that is required from the community and how much value that should bring to them in the form of governance rewards.  Nobody disputes the value of exchange rate proposals in the IC economy.  They are routine.  They are executed automatically.  They do not require brain power of the governing body.  We have people for that...Dfinity takes care of it automatically.

[/quote]

Which is why it is so important that currently everyone delegates to them and not leave us open to rouge proposals.  But! It is a massive vulnerability!  So why not incentivize fixing it?

The value of the work to determine who you delegate to is not worth less than the work to vote your yourself.(I think I'm fairly firm on that point).  Now I get that everyone is on the 'default' right now, but the other choice was to NOT create a neuron. Everyone made the choice. It was a good choice for at least the semi immediate future.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-26 03:20:02 UTC | #42

I remember last year when Dfinity first implemented Simple Majority and then stopped voting on Governance proposals.  I was shocked.  I felt like they were taking the training wheels off too soon.  Yet they had been saying since genesis that they want a decentralized governance system.  They have pushed us in that direction in many ways and very effectively in my opinion.  The most recent push was proposal weights and removing Governance from All Topics.  Each step they take to influence the community to grow up into this decentralized governance system has occurred by way of increasing active participation.  I agree there is a place for passive participation, but I also think we need to embrace more fully the intentional mutability of the system that increasingly incentivizes active participation.  When you step back and look at the changes that have been made and the proposals that have passed so far, what qualifies as active participation is still very passive.  It takes very little effort for most people to meet the criteria that enables them to maximize rewards.

-------------------------

Thank you for educating me on the exchange voting.  It make sense.
Understand your point now.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 03:26:53 UTC | #44

I agree.  I think we stop the current spam, regroup, and find a solution that works with both weights and not weights.  I think we can all agree that an ideal system is where there are lots of actively voting organizations/individuals and that we can reliably follow them(I think abstain needs to be removed from the decision matrix...either >50 accept or reject...reject is a path of minimal change so it should be default...working on a proposal in the next couple of days.).  This stops the spam and lets us focus on diversifying the follow options and gets us to a reset of the follows.  If we get it all lined up we can increase the weights in the categories we think are ready for further decentralization and bump the numbers again.

@skilesare I'm pretty surprised you didn't give any of us time to vote after posting the proposal. I was going to approve/support it, but it's just a bit shady to post and vote immediately before any of your followers have the time to vote. 

I am a huge supporter of the ICDevs mission, but will be removing the ICDevs neuron as a default followee because of this action.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 03:56:21 UTC | #48

Rewards were never lowered. You just got more if you followed voters or voted yourself. You were basically able to take rewards from people who either didn't know how to work the NNS, had their keys in an inconvenient place or were generally not savvy enough to update their settings.  This will not change the absolute number of rewards being issued.

Spammers and Whales are currently using the system to submit pseudo-informative posts to up their rewards.  Are you getting rewarded for voting or are they getting rewarded for spamming?  Sometimes two things are true. :slight_smile: 

This just resets things for a bit while we get our ducks in a row. :duck: :duck: :duck:

justmythoughts | 2022-04-26 03:59:55 UTC | #50

If this is the case, you may have discovered a bug or blown it. This proposal will pass, but its a bummer for people who enjoy manually voting early. I literally had just received a notification through the telegram bot.

At least we know that 34 million voters are influenced directly by ICDevs. That's impressive, but you lost my votes for the time being going forward.

@skilesare You may find it is in the best interests of the reputation of ICDevs to submit a proposal right away nullifying the result of proposal 56798 due to this issue. I want this proposal to pass, but I don't want it to pass under these terms.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 04:02:45 UTC | #54

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 04:11:05 UTC | #57

This puts it back to the original state which everyone staked under until the change was made.  Maybe everyone who asked between the change and now should be able to unstake? I get the issue.  You're not wrong...but neither are the people who thought they could follow ICA and DFINITY and get rewards for 8 years.

It was dumb. Maybe I clicked too fast or maybe my hotkeys get copied when I spawn a new neuron.  I'm not sure...but I should not have voted with the core ICDevs Neuron and it looks like that happened almost immediately.  It is ABSURD that it swayed that much. We need more named neurons yesterday.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 04:13:41 UTC | #59

I’m of the philosophy that no one should be forced to vote on governance and I’m going to try to find a solution for people to stake for 8 years without ever needing to log in to the nns.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 04:16:07 UTC | #60

I agree.  I think they should be able to set their follow to 10 reliable people and as long as one of them votes their neuron should follow.  Maybe we can put some kind of freshness on it that starts declining rewards, or an auto dissolve where if they don't vote manually or confirm neurons then after 8 years they start to dissolve.  There are options.

Yes, It will lower your rewards if this proposal passes.  

I don't think this proposal is necessary.  We don't need another temporary solution.  We only need a permanent solution.  We have one that has already passed a proposal and a couple other promising proposals that haven't' been submitted yet.  Energy should be focused on permanent solutions at this time in my opinion.  Proposal reject cost is the only temporary solution that makes sense.

For the record, @wpb has thought a good bit more about this than me and I'm inclined to agree with him. One caveat is that this proposal can be implemented by changing code on two lines and doesn't need to be tested as it is just constant being changed.  So it can be implemented very, very quickly.

-------------------------

Yes, It will lower your rewards if this proposal passes.
[/quote]

I'll caveat this with the fact that it will lower the number of ICP you receive but will likely also lower the number of ICP given to likely liquidators, thus there is a high likely hood that the price of ICP will stay higher if it is implemented.  It is more complicated than that and dissolves delays may skew that, but I think that using weighing is inflationary on the whole.  The people who aren't paying attention are also hodling. @Kyle_Langham could probably speak to what percentage of rewards vs dissolve occurs each day/month.

Are you kidding me? :joy: :joy: :joy: Please make something useful. You are from the cycledao.xyz and [ICDevs.org](http://ICDevs.org)?

I'm not sure what your criticism is, but you have no idea what I spent the first 14 hours of my day doing.  This is my non-profit second job.  I'd love some help if you are volunteering it :)

The folks at cycle_dao are smart as hell and are all under the pump building amazing things.  Part of the reason for this proposal is that I'd rather be building than filtering spam out of my NNS inbox.

skilesare | 2022-04-26 04:53:52 UTC | #71

Actually, this is hard though because I could follow a neuron that follows ICPMNS.  The code would have to follow the chain.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-26 05:05:13 UTC | #72

ICPMN neuron only follows our 13 individual voting members on the governance topic.  Each of us created new neurons with no Followee configured.  These neurons are specifically intended for voting on governance as Followees for the governance topic.

ICDevs could do the same today.  You don’t need to develop any new tooling if you just use the NNS like it was designed.  Whoever you want to vote for ICDevs, set their neuron as Followees for governance for ICDevs and ask them not to configure any Followee for their neuron.  Then start voting manually on all governance proposals.

BTW, you yourself have to create a voting neuron too.  You don’t want to vote manually for the ICDevs neuron.  You want your Followees to vote for the ICDevs neuron instead.

So from now on we gonna revoke the reward weight to 1 everytime there's a spammer event, right but what if the next spammer try to destroy the system instead of reward incentivize?

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-04-26 09:26:29 UTC | #74

I just thought we must have more thoughtful regarding a new solution, rather than just return to the original one if the new solution seem not working.

-------------------------

Based | 2022-04-26 10:23:17 UTC | #75

Hopefully this proposal tanks

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 10:38:09 UTC | #76

I proposed it as a temporary rollback so we have to have that discussion or it will just happen again. ETH uses ice age to force this where rewards start dropping if a fork isn’t released. Here we face spam if we don’t fix it. As @wpb says, one has already passed and there are other good suggestions, most of which take time to implement.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-04-26 10:57:14 UTC | #77

How to define spam? If this thing could drive the community to contribute some better solutions, I don't think we could define it as spam simply. Why not just let it moving (so that slowly more and more ppl from the community will know this is not the right solution and may have better one), and while at the same time figure out a better solution via discussion.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 12:13:32 UTC | #78

approaching governance like those wall street bet isn't the way to go, Panic attack, buy high sell low type of approach! Wish that will be tank or is it because @ysyms had touch the interest of some big neuron followee so now you regrouping and try to get rid of @ysyms risk management out at all cost?

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 12:14:47 UTC | #79

Btw I also think that this whole reward weight to 1 should be postpone untill periodic confirmation of neuron followees be introduced because it seem like icdev abusing power and try to abolish the governance reward without even noticing their followers

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-26 13:04:00 UTC | #80

I fundamentally disagree with this statement.  In my view, all stakers are participating in a fluid and evolving DAO, in which the expectation is that they participate in that evolution and receive rewards for their participation.  The system is not a passive stake investment, it is a governance system.  Anyone who stakes on the NNS should understand that the system will evolve and that the expectation on them is that they help shape that evolution and remain aware of any changes.

If we accept the mindset that stakers should be able to "set and forget" then we almost certainly will fail at governance.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 13:32:38 UTC | #81

The nns taking peoples money hostage for 8 years then changing the reward structure on a whim borders on fraud.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 13:40:43 UTC | #82

Postpone this proposal untill periodic confirmation of neuron followees be introduced so that we could know the legit number of real active followers that follow the big 3 followees so that any malicious followees couldn't use any death neuron to abuse the power within the NNS, decentralization of the NNS first.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 13:49:59 UTC | #83

Because it seem so sketchy already that icdev try to push that fast for this important proposal right before any change in confirmation of followees.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-26 13:53:30 UTC | #84

Please explain how the NNS is taking people's money hostage when it is a voluntary opt-in system.  At every step of the process (staking in a neuron, setting the dissolve delay, deciding to dissolve) it is the owner who has full authority over the decisions being made.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 13:56:30 UTC | #85

Overall tokenomic is not a child play, you shouldn't panic and try to shoot the risk manager that only do for mutual interest of the system.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 13:57:47 UTC | #86

Or is it because he touched the interest of some big followees?

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-26 14:12:49 UTC | #87

I think we have new web3 jokes

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 14:15:26 UTC | #88

this whole proposal is a joke, no wonder it took icdev so long to become a known followee

-------------------------

darien | 2022-04-26 14:19:13 UTC | #89

ok...so where were you when the weighting structure was being changed to increased for governance proposal rewards....was  that fraud also??

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 14:31:55 UTC | #90

Because the terms of the rewards structure change after you made the commitment to lock up for 8 years. There is no grey area we can’t be this cavalier about peoples money after we convinced them to lock up for 8 years. Anywhere in the world that would be called a scam.


But that’s just one issue. The second issue is worse:

Because voting is required we made nns centralized through following mechanic.

people are voting without proper research and even worst they are blindly following all because they need to click yes or no.


As it stands @skilesare could make a proposal to give him self a million icp and vote for him self and there is nothing we can do. 


The more I think about it the more I think tokenomics should be removed all together from governance and staking should just be passive. 

If it was passive it would be decentralized to the people that care.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 14:36:43 UTC | #91

No one gonna trust the system if we keep going back and forth like this. It should be delete or postpone.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 14:49:12 UTC | #92

While I disagree with postponing I agree with first statement. No one will trust a system that plays with their money. 

I want this motion to pass because in my humble opinion forcing governance is a disaster waiting to happen.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 14:57:16 UTC | #93

NNS and icp was not design for that, maybe we need someone to build another separate protocol for liquidity staking like liquity but please not here.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 14:59:43 UTC | #94

That is exactly what I'm afraid of, passive staking platform where people delegate votes to one entity, This entity then has full control of nns. All because we don't want people to be able to abstain from voting.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 14:59:22 UTC | #95

Might also boast up Defi ecosystem within the ICP too if we have another staking Defi protocol specifically for passive and be tokenize and distribute the ownership for it users.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 14:59:50 UTC | #96

No seperate not within the NNS

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-26 15:00:32 UTC | #97

ok but what stops me from making a defi app that does it with the NNS?

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 15:01:57 UTC | #98

Because the NNS is design for active in order for protocol to be more vibrant and flourish, voting with brain not with feet (sorry for saying that)

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 15:03:54 UTC | #99

NNS cannot be tokenize we should build another dapp for passive and it actually do good than harm for the system and also be another way for Defi to flourish within the ecosystem too

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 15:05:37 UTC | #100

that's why this proposal should be delete and find another way to solve the problem rather than panic and twist the whole tokenomic out of misunderstood

I resubmitted without voting. That was my bad. It is fixed an I won't vote until the last day.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 15:07:16 UTC | #102

So that known followee could be Delete in peace, sorry

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-04-26 15:10:03 UTC | #103

decentralization of the NNS, matter. NNS for active participant not for passive.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-26 15:11:18 UTC | #104

I promise not to do so. :joy:

I do have this proposal to try to help diversify the following so what happened with my vote does not happen again.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-incentivize-the-diversification-of-followees-in-the-nns/12237

Also, A proposal has already been passed and is being coded that lets you change your vote even after your followee has voted.
