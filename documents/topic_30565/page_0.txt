## **Project highlights**

CAPTCHAs suck! We all know it. Specially now with the AI boom everyone's just training ridiculous AIs with very complex tasks, like the funky maze CAPTCHAs.

Gotcha wants to make CAPTCHAs fun and on the Internet Computer.

## **Web3 advantages**

ReCAPTCHA, who holds the CAPTCHA monopoly belongs to Google. They have no intention of changing their privacy invasive ways or improving UX.
We want to open up the possibility for different people to create CAPTCHA mini games that are easy and fun for humans, but AI resistant.

## **How is it built**

Gotcha has the following services: 
- Registration Canister: for website or app owners wanting to integrate Gotcha CAPTCHAs into their systems to register themselves and obtain the necessary API keys to start requesting CAPTCHAs.
- CAPTCHA Generation Canister: responsible for creating the CAPTCHA upon request from a new website/app.
- CAPTCHA Performance Canister: derives analytics of the CAPTCHAs requested/solved.

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

This project relies on the Internet Identity for identification and authentication of customers wanting to integrate the Gotcha API and mange Gotcha integrations on their systems.

## **Status of the project**

We have gained significant knowledge in the CAPTCHA space, however we're in an early stage of development. However we hope to have a solid working scalable open source repo ready for contributions soon.
