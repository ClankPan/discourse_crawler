I have an actor class with arguments.

What is the best way to initialize the canister from this actor class, passing arguments?

* `dfx.json` + `dfx deploy` does not work, because I don't know any method to pass actor class arguments to `dfx deploy`
* Creating an additional argument-less canister only to create from it this canister is too resource wasteful and awkward.
* I don't know how to use `dfx install` (what exactly does it do? can `dfx deploy` be replaced by it?) and whether it can be a solution.

You should be able to deploy using `dfx deploy --argument <init arg>`

`dfx deploy` basically does `dfx canister create`, followed by `dfx build` and `dfx canister install`. There, too, you can use `dfx canister install --argument <init arg>`
