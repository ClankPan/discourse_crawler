As we approach the Bitcoin Halving this Friday, April 19th, we would like to invite the community to share updates on how their projects are using ckBTC and/or the Bitcoin integration. 

We encourage you to share any feature updates, technical overviews (especially highlighting the value of ckBTC and BTC on ICP), and/or tutorials with open-source code. 

Feel free to share links to your tweets in this thread or directly DM. We will be reviewing them and amplifying as many high-quality posts as possible. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out to us (CC: @radu) if you have any questions about the promotion.
