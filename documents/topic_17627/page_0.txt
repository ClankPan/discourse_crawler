The project https://github.com/icdev2dev/dos  provides some capabilities to SmartCanisters for responding to DOS attacks. Specifically this project provides the capabilities to prevent certain update functions from being executed on a dynamic basis in the SmartCanister on the Internet Computer.

It makes use of the new timer functionality as well.

This is great! We're going to need more of this as the IC grows.
