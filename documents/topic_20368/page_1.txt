I wish I got paid for talking about all the silly things DFINITY does! I‚Äôd have as much ICP as you! 

I was actually considering applying for a DFINITY grant now that you mention it though‚Ä¶ Thinking of hosting some type of talk show aiming to raise awareness of the dangers of centralized blockchains & networks! 

Jokes aside, it‚Äôs quite clear the only reason you‚Äôre in the thread is to distract from the fact of the matter - being that DFINITY can‚Äôt articulate any valid reasoning to dismiss the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal, so they‚Äôve decided to outright void it & ignore it. 

You are way to transparent Borovan.

What a theory - that‚Äôs definitely why I went out of my way to create an amendment to their proposed design flaws, rather than pushing the proposal as it passed, and the NNS called for. 

Let‚Äôs not forget this proposal is specifically optimized to assist DFINITY is regaining their voting power - as it was cited as the concern with the Periodic Followee Confirmation proposal (that has already passed). 

Are you saying DFINITYs contributions to the Internet Computer are reliant on them having super majority control? Furthermore, are you trying to justify the indefinite retention of a self assigned 99.8% centralized super majority? I could have sworn DFINITY refers to themselves as just one of many contributors - if they‚Äôre the best, they should have no issue regaining their self assigned voting power.

You can call this proposal a ‚ÄúBS Theory‚Äù all you‚Äôd like - but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that none of you have been able to articulate how this would have prevented spam. It quite clearly has the sole benefit of decentralization, and only would have enhanced spam at the time of proposal (which has since been amended). Clearly DFINITY didn‚Äôt do their due diligence, or only considered the inflation to their personal rewards when voting - and we‚Äôre now trying to work backwards.

You say that pursuing a proposal that has passed is a ‚Äúpoor substitute for decentralized governance‚Äù, yet you‚Äôre purposefully ignorant of the fact that this has been passed via the governance mechanism, and is actively circumvented - because DFINITY is just now realizing they don‚Äôt get inflated rewards in exchange for losing self assigned voting power (I‚Äôm not entertaining the spam thing anymore - I‚Äôve made it abundantly clear that none of you can articulate how that stopped spam. Why? Because it enhanced it.).

How many times does a proposal have to pass before it‚Äôs valid? Or is it only valid if DFINITY likes it?

Seeming more like centralized governance to me.

I voted for this when it came out, and now I'd vote the opposite way because it doesn't make sense any more.

Why do you have to continually unearth this proposal?  What's the agenda, I want to know.  I can have a good guess but I'd like you to tell me.

There's literally a firehose of technical magic coming out of the dfinity foundation now, all in the name of decentralisation.

You can't hide the fact you're fixated on this one proposal, and why?  Because it's the lowest hanging fruit you can go for that takes voting power away from DFinity.

Nobody is taking away from that. I, myself have said it *probably is* the best case scenario that people assign their voting power to DFINITY, *currently*. 

However, that doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that upon Genesis, DFINITY self assigned themselves 100% of voting power, with no means to see it decentralized. 

You can add as many decentralized aspects as you want, but it all boils down to the NNS - and that is centralized. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:69, topic:20368"]
To me, decentralization means a few things depending on the context - in relation to the governance of a traditional DAO, I would define decentralization as the lack of a central decision making entity.

However, due to the fact we utilize Liquid Democracy, the ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù aspect, is the choice in followee itself, as central decision making entities are baked into the protocol (regardless of the fact that these parties may or may not change over time). To which the grand majority of neurons have not consciously done, ever.

Given this, I‚Äôd define decentralization within liquid democracy a bit differently, being; ‚Äúthe conscious reaffirmation from neurons that they‚Äôre content with the actions of their liquid democracy representative, and the assignment of their voting power‚Äù.

Which is something we currently have never seen, as DFINITY assigned all voting power to themselves upon Genesis - without means set in place to see it relinquished.
[/quote]

So this is by no means cherry picking - I can quite clearly articulate my position, as I have been pursuing this since the proposal originally passed.

I know you were, but I figured this deep, I‚Äôd entertain it‚ù§Ô∏è 

You can observe their voting power through code based topics. When DFINITY votes, ~440m+ (depending on dissolves) voting power is cast, as depicted below;

This is not new information, and is something that has been acknowledged by DFINITY in previous conversations.

Governance is the issue, and that's way more decentralised and becoming more so by the day

That topic is one example of many.

The only topics they don‚Äôt have self assigned control over are Governance & SNS/Neuron Fund. The first of which are non-binding, and do not effect change, as we‚Äôre currently seeing. 

Meaning at the end of the day, governance proposals are glorified polls and mean nothing. 

[quote="borovan, post:150, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

When you call yourself ‚Äúa contributor‚Äù yet intentionally, indefinitely self assign & retain 100% of voting power on code based topics (the only ones that effect change, aside from the SNS, which just acts a controlling tool), you are no longer just a contributor, but the gatekeeper of the network. 

You become the one who makes decisions in regards to what‚Äôs implemented to the protocol, as you have unilateral voting power. 

That is only magnified when it‚Äôs insinuated that it is a security risk if DFINITY loses their self assigned supermajority - as nobody else can vote for themselves.  

You can‚Äôt call it a decentralized blockchain, when DFINITY has decided all changes & implementations must be approved by them first. 

If this were true liquid democracy, neurons should have to assign that voting power to DFINITY themselves. 

Completely unrelated, but how well do you think this ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù arguement would fare in the SEC case?

Fwiw @borovan, despite what you and others seem to think, my criticisms have never come from a place of malice or ill intent.

I work in an industry where establishing trust in systems is a huge deal. Im very aware of the real world threats that exist. I was first introduced to the IC by someone on LinkedIn who referenced it in a discussion about Zero Trust architecture. I fell in love with Dom‚Äôs vision of a world computer and fighting for that is truly what kept me around for so long.

Unfortunately the whole ‚ÄúInternet community‚Äù thing was entirely new to me. I had never done social media before and in hindsight I should have just stuck to the forums so I could focus on learning about the IC. It doesn‚Äôt shock me that my comments are perceived to be FUD given the environments I chose to engage with people. But then again, these forums aren‚Äôt much better, just a different status quo.

All that aside, I wish the best for the network but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt disappointed with DF‚Äôs decision making. For that reason I‚Äôve chosen to be a passive observer going forward.

I'll point out that we have little evidence that they would wield this control because, to my knowledge, no one has actually tried to submit a wasm for installation that they didn't generate.  If you did so, and they voted within the first few minutes to reject, I'd grant your point.  But if they let voting go for 4 days, and people take the time to spread the word about the proposal, I doubt they would get anywhere close to 99% if the proposal was open-sourced, done in good faith, and benefited the network.

I understand your desire to not waste your time, so maybe approach something less complicated and just see if your theory is correct?

I understand what you‚Äôre saying - that hypothetically, they could allow a proposal to be voted upon - but when it is time for DFINITY to cast their vote, they are casting all remaining voting power. 

Assuming you‚Äôre using governance topics as a reference of inactive vs active voting power (as done in this proposal) - DFINITY retains the ~50% inactive VP, as well as their personal ~20% VP - while ~30% VP ‚Äúvote for themselves‚Äù (assign followees, in reality). 

Not quite 99%, but it‚Äôs certainly more than an absolute majority.

-------------------------

darien | 2023-06-21 22:54:56 UTC | #162

write the code already and submit the proposal....show the community that DFINITY doesn't want to decentralize the IC.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-06-21 23:00:31 UTC | #163

I have been asking if this is a valid amendment to their proposed ‚ÄúSecurity Risk‚Äù. I have stated multiple times; I am not trying to undermine DFINITY, and would like to see this implemented in an optimal manner for them. 

If they don‚Äôt think this is a valid solution, I‚Äôd love to hear why, because we need to come up with something to fit the edge case they‚Äôre concerned about. 

Otherwise, there is quite literally no point in me writing the Periodic Followee Confirmation proposal - as they have stated they are not content with its current form.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-06-21 23:02:54 UTC | #164

It's all perspective I guess...as far as we know they would only choose to reject wasm proposals as a veto(this is a valid and rational set up for a multi cameral type dao systems.  Maybe they will only vote accept on their own proposals?  We don't know because no one has tried it.

There is nothing in the code that says what I suggest, and the code certainly makes what you suggest possible (and thus worthy to consider), but real life systems that work have a lot of shimmy and shake to them. 

We may need a code change to keep them from abusing power, but until we have a situation where they can abuse their power it is tough to say it is a sure thing.

I 100% get your concern and I'm looking forward to a wider array of contributors, but I don't think we're in a situation to get hung up on this one with how absolutely damn busy everyone is right now.

I'm going to suggest to the ICDevs board that we change our following on replica to CodeGov and then try to out some effort into promoting that other folks do the same as they are the first valiant attempt to attempt some outside expertise.  But man is it tough....the codebase is deep and in a really frustrating language for outsiders.  I think it will be a while before it is really safe to drastically diversify voting power on the topic.

My primary question / concern is, if this is a liquid democracy, should we be complacent rather than proactive in regards to the potential abuse of that voting power, when they have assigned it to themselves?

If we were to allow the scenario you reference to occur, through the active circumvention of proactive measures, what does that do to the optics of the protocol?

I am by no means saying DFINITY shouldn‚Äôt have the voting power they have - I am saying if this is a decentralized liquid democracy, as claimed, it should not be indefinitely self assigned by DFINITY to DFINITY. 

Voting Power is something that should be consciously allocated to the best followee the neuron owner sees fit.

I've tried to be more proactive. I had hoped that ICDevs would have raise enough to have code and replica review as part of the service we provide. The price action has decimated those plans. I received one amazing anon donation at the very beginning in ICP. The entire treasury is now worth about 2/3 of that one single largest donation at the time. In hind sight it was a mistake to bet that maturity off a 8 year neuron would fund an entire organization.  The entire community has a similar story. All of that to say, it is hard to be proactive if you don't have the resources to do so. If the price had started low and then gone high we would have very different problems(but sweet lambos!)

It is up to us and sweat at this point. I'll do all I can to contribute to helping form expertise outside the organization that can contribute and evaluate. I've made suggestions in the past and I'll keep pursuing these(multiple replicas, diversifies subnets, slashing so node providers have skin in the replica integrity -> expertise). But these are heavy lifts and I'm open to better ideas for the short term.

@Ivan 

I have removed a few of your posts because they:

1. Are flagged by multiple people
2. Actively attack individuals
3. Are completely off topic

Some other comments completely mischaracterize and/or show a misunderstanding of the topics, and it is hard for me to parse out whether this is honest misunderstanding, honest disagreement, or trolling. Your style of communication tbh creates such ambiguity. I however, left those because I am leaning towards "honest misunderstanding" and one should not be penalized for being not having the full picture.

You have been warned multiple times about the style of communication. I am sorry to say, but if you continue with this style, I will have to silence your user account. It is very important that we keep a civil place for communication.

With all due respect, I disagree. decentralization is VERY important to DFINITY.

I interpret your comment to think that the "reset foloweees" proposal in question is about *decentralization*, shows the fundamental issue at hand. The proposal was about spam, but some folks seem to:

a. Not care about spam
b. Love the side effect

I think that is a very reasonable take, but worth being upfront about it.

So far, we‚Äôve heard they don‚Äôt have resources, then there was a design flaw, now they have just decided the proposal is invalid (after stating this was a top priority Oct 2022).
[/quote]

I really want to be clear that the base assumption is DFINITY saw this proposal being about spam.. Once you see this, you see why:

1. It was low priority... so other resources were on high priority things
2. @bjoernek and @lara and others at DFINITY made time to think deeply about the proposal (based on user feedback). Their take-away was what they wrote.
3. The trade off or costs that @bjoernek pointed out of his "design flaw" can be summarized "since this not urgent, is this cost worth paying?"


So the main point stands:

1. DFINITY think it is best to decouple spam from other intents

2. You keep asking what DFINITY would vote if X, but there are so many versions of X, that it really depends on the implementation, and security costs and decentralization benefits. As it stands, the spam proposal has a very low upside (spam is not critical issue) and some security costs. Indeed, even this thread shows almost NO ONE cares about the spam issue which is literally the intent of the feature. The calculus is not there. 

I think it is reasonable you ask for feedback, but my feedback is this: rather than ask in high level terms, I think it is best if you write the actual proposal in terms of concrete costs and benefits. Even if its on the forum for feedback. The old proposal has clear feedback from DFINITY:

* the upside/benefits for spam are much less
* even proponents of the feature do not care about spam, but the side effects
* there should be a proposal for the actual goal

Let's take a moment here. This is very important: **The proposal literally says the intent is about spam.**

If you do NOT think this proposal will help spam, how does it help the IC to work on a proposal that?

* is about spam, but you do not think will help spam
* is about spam, but other people dont care its about spam (they want side effects)
* is about spam, but spam is low priority

*To be simple..*. the argument that the IC would benefit to work on a proposal that:

* People dont believe the implementation will help the goal (spam)
* People dont care about the goal (spam)

Is a bit odd, no?

Independent of how it helps or does not help spam, surely the above shows how fuzzy the rationale for the proposal in current form is, right?

How are you making this jump? DFINITY is not saying the proposal is valid. DFINITY is saying that it chooses not to invest precious resources on a proposal where:
* the goal is spam (and spam is low priroity)
* the goal is spam (and some people do not think will help spam)
* the goal is spam (and some people dont care about the spam at all, but side effects)
* the goal is spam (and some people voted on it because it is for spam, not the side effects)

Why not just submit a proposal for the real goal you want?

And what does that screenshot of what you posted supposed to mean?

That screenshot shows DFINITY did EXACTLY what it has said:

* DFINITY admitted it had not dedicated a team to work on proposal as it was under water in other work
* DFINITY recently passed the proposal for a team to look at. And their conclusion was clear (@lara posted it).

But more importantly... the main issue is what I wrote above about spam and the intent:  https://forum.dfinity.org/t/absolute-majority-weight-proposal-draft/20368/182?u=diegop

This is a good reason why there should be a separate proposal for the goal you want, then no?

It honestly does not matter HOW The proposal helps spam, it matters that the proposal was written with an implementation to help address spam. If you do not think that will help spam, then you are saying the proposal is not something we should follow.

I think you can see how working on a proposal that even its ardent proponents do not believe in is bad software engineering design.

In all honesty, I must express my deep disappointment regarding the continuous letdowns that have been occurring. It's disheartening to witness a thread that was meant for meaningful discussion and exchange of ideas being marred by childish comments and digressions. It's frustrating to see the potential for constructive dialogue go to waste.

I had hoped that we could engage in a thoughtful conversation where ideas are challenged and insights are shared. Instead, we've encountered a series of disappointments that have hindered any progress. It's disconcerting to witness the lack of respect and maturity displayed by some participants, as it undermines the purpose of this forum.

It's important for us to remember that we can express our opinions passionately without resorting to aggression. We should strive for an environment where factual information is presented and discussed objectively, fostering growth and understanding. Let's refocus our efforts on rekindling the meaningful conversation that initially drew us here.

I urge everyone to rise above the immaturity and negativity that has plagued this thread thus far. Together, we can redirect our energy towards productive and enlightening discussions. It's my hope that we can collectively contribute to a positive and respectful atmosphere that encourages intellectual exchange and helps us move forward as a community.

Let us acknowledge the disappointments we have faced and use them as motivation to rebuild this discussion with the sincerity and seriousness it deserves

Let me explain this in a visual way:

* In Q1'22, two changes led to a spam proposal incentive: (1) Default following for the governance topic was reset; (2) The governance topic received a higher reward weight of 20.
* These changes affected voting reward distribution as seen in this image (rows represent voters, columns represent weighted proposals). Note: active voters benefitted from non-active voters on the governance topic.
![image|690x336](upload://cLBHy0jlG8VHFk5astVTrdZrq0t.jpeg)

* With spam governance proposals, rewards for active voters increased further, as seen in the next image.
![image|690x351](upload://fJnrDtNP5eWN6E49TuQVmdQbHqA.jpeg)

* The introduction of period confirmation of followees would have prevented this spam incentive in the following way:
  * Non-active voters (those not voting at all) would stop receiving any rewards for both governance and non-governance topics.
  * Active voters would receive rewards proportional to their voting power, without any benefit in case that additional proposals are submitted. 

I hope this clarifies.

I understand your frustration with the repetitive nature of the discussion, but it's important to approach the conversation with respect and open-mindedness. While it may feel like we're going in circles, it's essential to consider different perspectives and engage in constructive dialogue.

However, if you believe that the conversation has become stagnant or unproductive, it could be helpful to introduce new angles or fresh ideas to stimulate meaningful discussion. Let's focus on exploring different viewpoints, seeking common ground, and finding potential solutions together. By doing so, we can move beyond the repetition and foster a more fruitful exchange of ideas.


We have seen multiple proposals by ICPMaximalist Network, of which many were submitted by @wpb , and in the process knowingly or unknowingly, voters were able to appropriate rewards from other passive neurons. A morally sane person would assume that this is stealing, but I‚Äôm not gonna use that word here.

This undermines the credibility of on-chain governance. This is where the spamming started and the whitehat spammer continued to spam the NNS with proposals to mock the actions of two large organizations that have total control over the network.


So would it be safe to say that you have the cause of spam proposals backwards and raised the limit of proposal submission cost to avoid this mockery?

Hope we move past abusing the most powerful on-chain governance DAO for our selfish gains and truly decentralize the network with meaningful proposals ( not the ones that are lobbied behind closed doors )

DFINITY's decision to implement the Absolute Majority Weight system demonstrates their commitment to maintaining an efficient and inclusive governance framework. This argument aims to justify why DFINITY made the right choice by embracing the Absolute Majority Weight system and the positive impacts it can have on decision-making processes.

1. Ensuring Sound Decision-Making: The Absolute Majority Weight system allows for decisions to be made with the support of an absolute majority, providing a more rigorous and reliable decision-making process. By requiring a substantial consensus, DFINITY ensures that proposals have undergone thorough scrutiny and have gained broad support from network participants. This fosters the development of robust and well-considered decisions, leading to the implementation of effective policies and protocols.
2. Balancing Stakeholder Interests: Implementing the Absolute Majority Weight system helps strike a balance between diverse stakeholder interests. By demanding an absolute majority, DFINITY ensures that decisions consider the perspectives and concerns of a wide range of participants. This approach promotes fair representation and prevents decisions from being skewed towards a particular subset of stakeholders. It fosters an environment where all voices are heard, facilitating the creation of more equitable and inclusive governance outcomes.
3. Enhancing Network Stability: The Absolute Majority Weight system contributes to network stability by minimizing the potential for abrupt changes driven by a small faction. Requiring an absolute majority acts as a safeguard against hasty decisions that could disrupt the ecosystem. This mechanism encourages deliberation, consensus-building, and long-term strategic thinking. By implementing this system, DFINITY fosters stability, instills confidence, and ensures the network's sustainable growth and development.
4. Strengthening Trust and Legitimacy: A governance framework that prioritizes an absolute majority cultivates trust and confidence among network participants. When decisions are made with a substantial consensus, it enhances the legitimacy of the governance process. Network members are more likely to trust and abide by decisions that have garnered broad support, leading to increased cooperation and collaboration within the ecosystem. DFINITY's adoption of the Absolute Majority Weight system establishes a strong foundation for trust and credibility.

Conclusion: DFINITY's choice to implement the Absolute Majority Weight system reflects their commitment to effective governance, fair representation, and the long-term stability of the network. By ensuring sound decision-making, balancing stakeholder interests, enhancing network stability, and strengthening trust and legitimacy, this system contributes to the overall success of DFINITY. Through this thoughtful decision, DFINITY sets an example for other networks, showcasing the importance of inclusive and well-considered governance mechanisms in building robust blockchain ecosystems.

Spam Proposals were an issue because of how rewards were distributed.

There was a set amount of rewards to be distributed amongst all voting members on a daily basis. This has been amended through @skilesare System Based to Voter Based Reward proposal.

Removing more people from the reward pool would have only further dramatized the effects & profitability of spam. 

Which is why I say; resetting followees doesn‚Äôt fix spam, it makes it better.

I personally believe it has become stagnant. Dfinity has stated they will not be implementing the previous proposal, and stated their reason why. Whether members agree with them or not, that's where they stand. If anyone wants to move forward, as I said above, it is my belief someone should start fresh and submit a new proposal focused on one issue (followee reset) and get the current pulse of the voting community.

To repeat:

You want to write code for a proposal whose goal (spam) you do not agree with or thinks makes sense, but like some of its side effects? 

How is that good software design? 

why dont you make a proposal for the intended goal and write code that has that goal in mind?

I am not sure you have accepted the fundamental disconnect here @Accumulating.icp:

[quote="diegop, post:186, topic:20368"]
* the goal is spam (and spam is low priroity)
* the goal is spam (and some people do not think will help spam)
* the goal is spam (and some people dont care about the spam at all, but side effects)
* the goal is spam (and some people voted on it because it is for spam, not the side effects)
[/quote]

[quote="diegop, post:182, topic:20368"]
Let‚Äôs take a moment here. This is very important: **The proposal literally says the intent is about spam.**

If you do NOT think this proposal will help spam, how does it help the IC to work on a proposal that?

* is about spam, but you do not think will help spam
* is about spam, but other people dont care its about spam (they want side effects)
* is about spam, but spam is low priority

*To be simple‚Ä¶*. the argument that the IC would benefit to work on a proposal that:

* People dont believe the implementation will help the goal (spam)
* People dont care about the goal (spam)

‚ÄúBasically; we didn‚Äôt do our due diligence, and believe this proposal should now be void, as it has other effects that we didn‚Äôt consider‚Äù

You‚Äôre repeating yourself to no effect. Please answer this question;


[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:110, topic:20368"]
So because someone sees an alternative value in the proposal (of which you have acknowledged in the past), it should be voided because it does not fall within the intentions of the original proposer? If due diligence was done on this proposal, should all of these effects not have been foreseen and considered upon originally voting? Why is it that this is considered a priority & on the roadmap upon our original dialogues, yet not a priority or recognized as a necessity now?
[/quote]

Additionally, it‚Äôs not intellectually honest of you to portray it as though ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe this negates spam‚Äù - I have shown you why it doesn‚Äôt negate spam, but rather enhances it.  


[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:201, topic:20368"]
Spam Proposals were an issue because of how rewards were distributed.

There was a set amount of rewards to be distributed amongst all voting members on a daily basis. This has been amended through @skilesare System Based to Voter Based Reward proposal.

Removing more people from the reward pool would have only further dramatized the effects & profitability of spam.

Which is why I say; resetting followees doesn‚Äôt fix spam, it makes it better.

>Why is it that DFINITY gets to unilaterally decide which passed proposals are valid, or not?

* DFINITY (as any off-chain entity can), decide where to spend money and time. 
* DFINITY is t**he one respecting the written intent of the proposal: spam**, and asking community to make proposal for what community intent is if they want something different. 
* **Ironically, you are the one who is saying the original goal of proposal is invalid**. Your arguments can be summarized as (paraphrasing),"i know proposal is about spam, but i don't think it helps spam and want it for something different."

We have done our research, and as per our research, You were the manager of ICPMN neuron, which now has been rebranded to synapse. It was you who submitted proposals while being the manager of ICPMN neuron.


What we do not understand is why do you choose to lie even though there are literally 100s of witnesses and participants that have seen this. Plausible deniability is a really great tool, but blockchains do not care for it. We are here to seek truth and decentralization. What you are doing here is blatantly lying and misdirecting. Facts don‚Äôt change no matter how we twist our words. From your replies its evident that the governance has been abused and now is being covered up.

When I‚Äôve asked you about this, you‚Äôve told me
[/quote]

‚Ä¶when you‚Äôve asked me, I‚Äôve explained why it would have disincentivized spam.  Like I said, at a certain point it feels pointless to continue to explain the concept over and over to someone who is not willing to accept an answer.  Periodic confirmation of neuron followees absolutely would have stopped spam, but it was solved in a different way instead.  Hence, that proposal only stands on the decentralization angle you are advocating, which was not the primary justification that people were asked to consider when the proposal was submitted to the NNS.  I have advocated that justification in the past too, but my opinion has changed because I think there are bigger issues to address first.

diegop | 2023-06-22 18:51:08 UTC | #216

@Ivan  @wpb you were looking for realltme examples of distractions here is a perfect one:

How people or Synapse voted is not relevant to the proposal's intent, proposed solution or goal.

No one has flagged this comment, but this is an example of rabbit holes I want to avoid.

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-06-22 18:54:12 UTC | #217

We also know that some of the DFINITY employees were part of ICPMN network too. The voting reward changes were responsible for spam proposals because it incentivized malicious actors to drain voting rewards from neurons that did not vote on around 30 spam proposals submitted by @wpb, which netted these voters around + 70% APY at the expense of other neurons.


We want the network to be more secure and not abused by those that claim to decentralize it. So this is very relevant to the topic because without all these foolishness, we would not be discussing this proposal right now.

I‚Äôm glad you respect the ‚Äúalleged intent‚Äù! Now it‚Äôs time to start honouring & respecting proposals! 

Just because you don‚Äôt like the side effects, does not make something void.

That is now the crux of the matter - DFINITY is imposing unilateral decision making authority - on behalf of proposals that have already passed via the NNS.

Show me how I am wrong. It is intellectually dishonest of all of you to say this prevents spam. This enhances it; and provides greater rewards.

Let's get back on track:

I will be direct: Your comments seem more like your frustation at the past and less about "should we invest time and energy to execute the proposal to reduce spam".

It seems you are bringing up the past (whose characterization i disagree with btw, but thats another matter), to help give what you see as important historical context. If that is your goal, you have both achieved it @wpb @Ivan . let's stop repeating ad nauseam back and forth on this.

It is not void. The governance proposal on spam passed. DFINITY is working on high priority items and no one on this thread thinks spam is high priority. Your offer of coding up a proposal that you do not believe will actually help spam goes against the intent of the proposal. 

Community (and you) are arguing for work to improve decentralization. That is a different (yet unpassed) proposal. Make such a proposal! No one is stopping folks.

Before you say it‚Äôs not a priority because spam isn‚Äôt an issue - it wasn‚Äôt in October 2022 when we talked about this either. This has been about decentralization for a while, hence why we‚Äôve seen DFINITY throw so many barriers at this topic, one by one - in attempt to see what sticks.

- No Resources
- Low Priority
- Has a Design Flaw
- Proposal shouldn‚Äôt count anymore

Diego we would really appreciate if you don‚Äôt tag us. We no longer want to have any conversation with you or wenzel, since we do not think you have enough credibility or expertise in this matter.


But please do not mistake our patience for cowardice or incompetence. We will not hesitate to present facts that are relevant to the Internet Computer. We do believe that this technology can change the world. We trust smart contracts. But do not ask us to trust you or DFINITY.
