Whos "we" ?

Im personally building a project on ICP as well as a full time job, so I'm outworked.

The fact you guys can go into such great depth of analysis for the cause of "decentralisation" intrigues me.

It's well know Binance is one the most centralised blockchains out there, and look at the liquidity. Most people couldnt care less!

ICP probably has the best developer experience in the entire market right now, which is the main thing right?

It does baffle me the intention here, considering the effort you guys put in. Seriously

I will be frank:
* characterizing the content moderation to squelch rowdiness and ad hominems as "censorship" is deliberately misleading. I respect your right to disagree, but similarly I will express my opinion: I think not enough credit is given to the fact that active content moderation of debates is a reason this is a high quality forum. 

* "against powerful people"? "sabotage your projects"?  I cannot speak for the whole community, but i suspect that there is a lot less malicious behavior and actors as you may assume. Really most people want ICP to succeed, not take action against people writing on forums.

Ok @Accumulating.icp I will break it down in simple terms:

1. The proposal was meant to address spam.
2. Spam is addressed.

To DFINITY, the proposal is meant to address spam. Spam is not an issue (and no one seems to carr abot it). That is DFINITY respecting its intent. **If a person is cured from a disease, would it make sense to still open them up for a surgery?** 

Your take would be "yes, because there is a side effect that I like"

DFINITY's take is "No. If someone like a side effect, lets plan/schedule a less invasive procedure for THAT side effect."

You may disagree or not like my answer, but i have not sidestepped. I have explained this many times through many angles at the same basic idea.

Nobody is saying they shouldn’t have the voting power they have. 

The issue is that they’ve taken the liberty to assign this voting power to themselves, with no means to see it decentralized. It’s not accurate to call this the early days of the network anymore - this is 2 years post genesis. 

In regards to your Binance comment - they are not claiming to provide an alternative decentralized internet & tech stack.

[/quote]

Was due diligence done on this proposal or not? We’ve been over how this does not address spam. It simply inflated the rewards of those participating at the time. 

Why was the proposed implementation not looked at objectively, and only within the scope of the proposer? This is sounding rather short-sighted on DFINITYs side. 


[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:110, topic:20368"]
So because someone sees an alternative value in the proposal (of which you have acknowledged in the past), it should be voided because it does not fall within the intentions of the original proposer? If due diligence was done on this proposal, should all of these effects not have been foreseen and considered upon originally voting? Why is it that this is considered a priority & on the roadmap upon our original dialogues, yet not a priority or recognized as a necessity now?
[/quote]

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:15, topic:20368"]
How exactly would this have removed a imbalance?

What you’re describing is a way to increase rewards, from what I’m reading.

If the rewards are divided amongst all neurons that vote, and you are trying to remove neurons from that pool - that just inherently increases your own rewards, and in turn the rewards of those spamming.

I say again, if people are actively contributing to and benefitting from spam, resetting their followees does not circumvent them, but rather benefit them - as they are actively paying attention to the NNS to vote for & receive their rewards.
[/quote]


[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:201, topic:20368"]
Spam Proposals were an issue because of how rewards were distributed.

There was a set amount of rewards to be distributed amongst all voting members on a daily basis. This has been amended through @skilesare System Based to Voter Based Reward proposal.

Removing more people from the reward pool would have only further dramatized the effects & profitability of spam.

Which is why I say; resetting followees doesn’t fix spam, it makes it better.

Yes. 

You think the proposal does not address spam. Others think it does.  That does not make your POV that it does address spam as fact. That does not mean people agree. 

In fact, most voters (presumably) agree it does help spam. (Or are you saying that people did not read the first paragraph).

It is possible you are right, possible you are wrong. But does not mean its consensus.

Or, and hear me out, I know this sounds like a crazy concept - but is it possible people found alternative value in the proposal in comparison to the scope of the proposer?

Because the proposer created the implementation allegedly under the premise of spam, does equate to people only being able to agree with it for that purpose, to you?

Just to be clear. 

Lets say I agree with you and say the proposal enhances spam. What are you proposing? Working on a proposal that enhances spam?

This is why this conversation is confusing to me. 

It jumps from point to point but avoids the central issue:

> * the goal is spam (and spam is low priroity)
> * the goal is spam (and some people do not think will help spam)
> * the goal is spam (and some people dont care about the spam at all, but side effects)
> * the goal is spam (and some people voted on it because it is for spam, not the side effects)

I can’t tell if this is intentional or unintentional ignorance, so I’ll entertain it. 

DFINITY claims there is a design flaw within the Periodic Followee Confirmation proposal - being they lose their indefinitely self assigned super majority (go decentralization!). I have prepared an amendment to this “design flaw” for you. 

At this point in time, this proposal has no “effects”, other than increasing the decentralization of our liquid democracy (it no longer affects reward distribution, as denoted below).

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:69, topic:20368"]
To me, decentralization means a few things depending on the context - in relation to the governance of a traditional DAO, I would define decentralization as the lack of a central decision making entity.

However, due to the fact we utilize Liquid Democracy, the “decentralized” aspect, is the choice in followee itself, as central decision making entities are baked into the protocol (regardless of the fact that these parties may or may not change over time). To which the grand majority of neurons have not consciously done, ever.

Given this, I’d define decentralization within liquid democracy a bit differently, being; “the conscious reaffirmation from neurons that they’re content with the actions of their liquid democracy representative, and the assignment of their voting power”.

Which is something we currently have never seen, as DFINITY assigned all voting power to themselves upon Genesis - without means set in place to see it relinquished

No. The proposal  has always been about spam. The prioritization reflects that (spam was not a priority). To you and some, it was about decentralization. That does not change the literal wording on the proposal which says the proposal is about spam. 

I have repeated this many times and the fact you cannot accept that means I may stop trying entirely soon.

I’ve already had to say this so many times, but just because DFINITY, or the original proposer doesn’t see the entire scope of an implementation, does not mean it should be voided - it was passed via the NNS.

Your argument is "the proposal mechanics fail to address the intent, but here are some minor improvements to help the side effects. Give me feedback on the improvements to help side efffects"

Do you see?

**More importantly: I have given you feedback:**

**Submit a concrete proposal with your desired intent so it can be read in its entire context (goal and implementation). Not pieces and modifications across forum posts. That's it.**

DFINITY is the one who brought the context of spam to this discussion. I have simply shown you that your ideology for pushing this proposal under that context is beyond flawed.
