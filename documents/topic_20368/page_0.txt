**Proposal**

As a solution to the “design flaw” referenced by @bjoernek , in response to the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal, I propose two modifications to the “Absolute Majority” functionality within Proposals. 

Primarily, I propose that the calculation to determine an Absolute Majority is altered. 

Currently, it considers all voting power, and executes an Absolute Majority if 50%+ of total voting power has been exerted on “yes” or “no” votes respectively. I reccomend that rather than considering total voting power - the average total Voting Power exerted on specifically “Governance” proposals, across the last year (“Active Voting Power”), is utilized to calculate the Absolute Majority threshold. 

Secondarily, as this implementation would nearly enable DFINITY to enact an Absolute Majority themselves, I propose the readjustment of the Absolute Majority minimum threshold requirement. I recommend the Absolute Majority Threshold is increased from 50%+ total voting power, to a minimum of 80% of “Active Voting Power” - with gradual reductions as we see DFINITYs voting power reduce over time. 


**Objective** 

This proposal sets out with the objective to lay the groundwork for the decentralization of the network. 

It has been stated by DFINITY that the enactment of the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal has been postponed, not only due to resources, but to a “design flaw” within the mechanism. 

The foundation cited that the immediate removal of voting power, over code based topics, could lead to insecurity within the network - being the inability to pass network critical updates immediately, without a super majority. 

This proposal offers a remedy, which would in turn remove a barrier from the enactment of the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal, by removing the necessity to control such a drastic percentage of total supply.

Adjusting the weight calculation of what an Absolute Majority is defined as, utilizing Active Voting Power, rather than Total Voting Power, enables the foundation to gradually relinquish the ~98% super majority they’ve assigned themselves, while still ensuring the security of the network. 

By utilizing the average voting power asserted on governance proposals over the last year, the protocol is able to ensure a reliable metric in relation to Active Voting Power, that can’t be skewed by short term variables. This also ensures an accurate representation of what voting power is most likely to look like, after a followee reset - as the governance topic is the only topic to undergo a reset to date. 

Through shifting the minimum Absolute Majority threshold, the protocol is simultaneously able to ensure that there is not a central entity, who is able to assert 51%+ control via pre-existing voting power. This safeguards the transition from a Total Voting Power Absolute Majority to an Active Voting Power Absolute Majority, without further jeopardizing the decentralization of the network. 


**Pros**

- Enables Robust Governance & Updates of the Protocol, post Periodic Followee Confirmation

This proposal ensures that post Periodic Followee Confirmation, the Internet Computer Protocol does not face security issues, aligning with the lack of ability to affect “Absolute Majority” updates. This concern is directly absolved when converting from a Total Voting Power Absolute Majority system, to an Active Voting Power Absolute Majority system. This is due to the fact Active Voting Power is more likely to reassign, or utilize voting power (as shown via the Governance Proposal Reset), in comparison to voting power that is not actively exercised - but rather employed under an indefinite “set&forget” model. 

- Governance Proposals become more than a glorified poll, as they directly correlate to Active Voting Power

To date, there is nothing binding about governance proposals - they do not enact code based changes. Tying the weight of the Absolute Majority indirectly generates a necessity to participate within Governance proposals - being the security of the network. 

- Ensures a super majority can not be achieved with pre-existing Voting Power

By adjusting the minimum requirement to enact an Absolute Majority, the protocol can ensure that the Active Voting Power Governance Mechanism can not be enacted by a single one party’s owned Voting Power. 


**Cons**

- Reduces the required Voting Power to achieved an Absolute Majority 

To achieve an Absolute Majority, at the time of writing, it would require ~222.5M of ~445M Voting Power. Of which, according to the IC Dashboard, DFINITY owns ~94.5M. Meaning DFINITYs personal voting power, translates to 42% of the requirement for an Absolute Majority. 

Under the affect of this proposal, an Absolute Majority would require ~184M VP of ~230M Active Voting Power (this is not an accurate representation of annual average voter participation, but rather an example, based off recent proposal outcomes). Of which, according to the IC Dashboard, DFINITY owns ~94.5M. Meaning DFINITYs personal voting power, would translate to 51% of the requirement for an Absolute Majority.

This means that the amount of Voting Power required to enact an Absolute Majority, decreases by about ~40M (10% of total voting power), while DFINITYs ability to enact an Absolute Majority increases by about 10%, under the affect of this proposal.

*Proposal Written by accumulating.icp*


I’d like to emphasize that this is the draft proposal, therefor I am open to discussion, revision, and feedback regarding the proposal. This will be proposed one week after the start of dialogue on forums.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-06-01 04:28:20 UTC | #2

This proposal does not seem like the right course of action at this time.  While I do think that default following has a stifling effect on decentralization in some ways, there are big gaps that need to be addressed before we should remove default following.  It probably needs to be a more wholistic plan and I think the only entity that will be able to develop a plan that the community will accept is DFINITY.  They have been the only contributor to the IC that has taken action that has resulted in decentralization so far and I think we should rely on them to develop a strategy that continues the progression toward decentralization without constraining them on how to achieve it.

In my opinion, a big gap that exists is that there are no incentives for people and organizations to get involved at the protocol level in proposal topics other than the Governance and the SNS & Community Fund topics.  We need competency groups that can specialize in specific proposal topics, but there is simply no incentive to engage in that way.  Once they exist, then the concept of decentralization at the protocol level starts becoming more meaningful.  Decentralization of the Governance topic made sense because there were groups (e.g. [ICDevs.org](www.ICDevs.org), ICPMN (now [synapse.vote](www.synapse.vote)), and cycle_dao (now Arthur)) that were ready to offer options that people could choose.  Of course, additional options now exist for the Governance topic.  There are no options for other topics.  Decentralization should occur because the community steps up and earns it, not because DFINITY simply relinquishes the total voting power that they can currently trigger.

Sure, an argument can be made that we can take away default following and then people can actively choose to follow DFINITY, but does that really change anything that achieves decentralization?  In fact, if both elements of this proposal are implemented as currently written, then it will make ICP look more centralized around DFINITY because their apparent voting power will be much bigger.  Can anyone really pass the red face test explaining how ICP is decentralized when 51% of NNS voting power belongs directly to DFINITY?  At best, that will just cause more complaining by the community and raise red flags for outsiders.  I would much prefer that we not mess with the definition of Absolute Majority at all.

I think a better way to address the need for speed for security updates is to create a new proposal topic called Security Updates and copy to it the current Followees from the “All Topics Except Governance, SNS & Community Fund” catch all category.  DFINITY could use that category as needed for security updates that need to be implemented faster than the typical 4 day voting period.  It may not be quite this simple, but anything that flags a proposal as a security update and enables DFINITY to execute the proposal immediately would work.

All that said, at this point I think it is best to wait for DFINITY to develop more comprehensive and vetted strategies that enable decentralization to progress forward.  Periodic confirmation of neuron followees originated from a desire to solve a major NNS spam problem.  I think the idea resonated with a lot of people because it was further justified as a mechanism to advance decentralization.  However, it was not a fully vetted idea, and it was quickly recognized after the proposal voting ended that it has negative security implications.  I’m more inclined to submit a NNS proposal that rescinds the periodic confirmation of neuron followees proposal than I am to change the definition of Absolute Majority as a solution to the design flaw.  I would rather DFINITY come up with a better plan and I’m very curious if the majority of the community would still support the original proposal today since a lot has changed since then.

I find this set of statements to be ironic, given I’ve offered to write the code for both proposals - to be turned down. At this point, it quite clearly is not about a lack of “competency groups” , but the lack of desire to pursue. 

Furthermore, I’m not sure how you expect other groups to begin contributing, if your response to contributors is “well, only DFINITY can contribute in a way that the Community will accept”. You’re the one setting up the barrier for other contributors to this blockchain by doing so.

I’m doing this for free. My incentive is the decentralization of the network, and its longevity. Are my contributions only acceptable if I’m paid via an NNS treasury?

[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20368"]
but does that really change anything that achieves decentralization
[/quote]

Given that this 98% super majority was self assigned, yes, by ensuring people periodically reaffirm their voting power, that is directly contributing to the decentralization of the network.


[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20368"]

I reccomend you re-read this proposal thoroughly.

This does not affect the execution of proposals outside of an “Absolute Majority” scenario. 

The foundation would not own 51% of voting power within this scenario. They’d own 51% of what’s required to execute a super majority, in comparison to the current 42%. 

That’s certainly a huge loss for decentralization, when considering they already have 98% super majority control. Not 98% of what’s require for a super majority - but 98% super majority control. 

There’s a difference. 


[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20368"]
create a new proposal topic called Security Updates and copy to it the current Followees from the “All Topics Except Governance, SNS & Community Fund” catch all category.
[/quote]

So your solution, to proposed gradual decentralization, is to allow them to retain 98% control under the name of security? It still leaves us in the scenario of, how do we ever ensure the decentralization of this voting power, that they’ve assigned to themselves. This is working backwards in my opinion. 

 
[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20368"]

As stated in the previous dialogue - while that may have been *your* agenda, it’s intellectually dishonest to deny the true benefit of this proposal, and the reason it resonated with so many; being the decentralization of the 98% indefinitely assigned voting power to DFINITY. 


[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20368"]
However, it was not a fully vetted idea, and it was quickly recognized after the proposal voting ended that it has negative security implications.
[/quote]

As stated, I am more than happy to work through these security implications with the community & foundation - hence why this draft exists to begin with. 

Indefinitely self-assigning 98% of voting power has no justification & I am willing to work through these barriers.

I am curious if there are any legitimate concerns regarding this solution - because as previously stated, I don’t think you read it thoroughly, which skewed your perception of functionalities. 



[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20368"]
Decentralization should occur because the community steps up and earns it, not because DFINITY simply relinquishes the total voting power that they can currently trigger.

Is that not what I’m doing, Wenzel? Surely, we also see the irony in saying we have to “earn” decentralization in a **blockchain** - when the voting power was self assigned to begin with.

I’m genuinely starting to wonder if we read the same forums…? 

- You clearly did not understand the proposal based off the fact you think it enables DFINITY to enact a super majority with VP they own - it does not. 

- You continuously portray that DFINITY is the only one who is capable of committing code based changes - as I have offered to do it.

- You claim there is no incentive for people to get involved with governance - as the incentive is the success of the protocol.

- You think that having neurons reaffirm that they’re comfortable with where their voting power is allocated, does not contribute to decentralization - as it was self-assigned by the Foundation, to the Foundation, in most instances. 

There’s a reason I quote what you say when I respond. I am curious how these are not corrections..?

I’m glad you stand so firm on your position! However, that doesn’t change the fact that you have not articulated a credible reason, regarding your distaste for this proposal. 

I assure you, I am in no way offended that I don’t have your support - this is not something that is new to me. However, I do find it ironic that you try to frame it as though I am. I could have sworn you always say that I’m the one trying to “draw narratives”..?

The extent of our dialogue has quite clearly been you voicing your concerns, to which I have responded. If you’d like to show why you don’t think my response has adequately addressed your concerns, you are more than welcome to - I would honestly appreciate it. The purpose of this topic was to generate a dialogue on the pro’s & cons of this proposal. 

But again, if you’re going to push a half-baked ideology, to then say “I don’t want to talk anymore” if you’re corrected, please do not comment on my topics at all. Thank you.

That is fair, but I don't believe your original response accurately represented the resulting effects of this proposal at all. This proposal would not result in DFINITY owning 51% of voting power. This proposal would not change anything other than the calculation of an Absolute Majority. This proposal would leave DFINITY with 51% of what's *required* to enact an Absolute Majority. To reiterate again, this would not affect voting power outside of Absolute Majority scenarios. This is in comparison to the 42% of required VP they currently own, and 98%+ of total VP they control.

[/quote]

Good morning Wenzel,

I appreciate that you’re willing to expand further upon this topic. The following list is comprised of what I believe to be the primary “misconceptions” within the original response, alongside my response to them, in an effort to “restart” this conversation productively (please excuse the lack of direct quotes - all topics have been quoted in previous posts); 

- “DFINITY is the only competent contributor to the Internet Computer - therefor we should just let them do it”

In my opinion, this is a mis-categorization of the scenario - there are many competent contributors to the Internet Computer. If this weren’t the case, we wouldn’t see so many grants from DFINITY to open-source infrastructure within the ecosystem. While there aren’t foundation alternatives yet, there are development teams, and individual developers, who write reliable code, within this ecosystem. I believe it is intellectually dishonest to say DFINITY is the only one who can, and should be contributing to code based changes via the NNS. As independent contributors is something we’ve been striving for, we should not be setting up barriers for them to begin contributing. 


- “There is no incentive for other contributors to the Internet Computer”

I would again call this a mis-categorization of the situation. As an ICP holder & neuron owner, you are inherently incentivized to contribute to the governance of the protocol, in any manner you deem beneficial to the Internet Computer. While obviously not everybody has the knowledge to develop code based changes for ICP, there are some that do - the IC is written in Rust, which is an extremely well documented language. 

I am offering to write not only the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal code, but the code for the Absolute Majority Calculation & Minimum Threshold shift as well. I am not requesting anything on behalf of completing this work, as I believe it’s something that will benefit the Internet Computer, and in turn my neurons & holdings in the long run. 

Incentivization does not always need to come in the form of immediate monetary gain. 


- “This proposal gives DFINITY 51% of Voting Power”

If the second half of this proposal did not exist, that would nearly be the case. However, the second implementation, in which the amount of “Active Voting Power” (rather than the current, “Total Voting Power”) required to enact an Absolute Majority, is increased to 80%, prevents this scenario from occurring. 

This is depicted within the following math;

**Current Absolute Majority**
*There is currently ~445M Total Voting Power*
*DFINITY owns ~94.5M Voting Power* 

~445M VP * .501 = ~222.94M VP Absolute Majority Threshold

~94.5M VP / ~222.94M VP = 42.3% Required VP to enact Absolute Majority owned by DFINITY

~94.5M VP / 445M VP = 21.2% Total VP owned by DFINITY

**Adjusted Absolute Majority**
*There is currently ~230M Active Voting Power*
*DFINITY owns ~94.5M Voting Power* 

~230M VP * .801 = ~184.23M VP Absolute Majority Threshold

~94.5M VP / ~184.23M VP = 51.3% Required VP to enact Absolute Majority owned by DFINITY

This results in a +9% difference in DFINITYs current ability to enact an Absolute Majority, with the trade off of enacting the Periodic Followee Reset - which removes DFINITYs current indefinite self-assigned 98% super majority. In my opinion, this is the best of both worlds & gives both parties what they need. DFINITY needs to be able to feasibly execute time-sensitive proposals - while the Internet Computer, if we want to continue to proclaim it as a decentralized blockchain, needs a followee reset. 

I’d like to also reiterate, that this would not affect the execution of a proposal outside of an Absolute Majority scenario. Meaning, if a scenario has, for example, 4% yes votes, 3% no votes - this system would not be applied, as there is no execution of an Absolute Majority. 


- “Periodic Followee Confirmation only intends to address spam proposals, not decentralization”

Can you please explain to me how exactly this addresses spam, at all? If people are incentivized by spam, then resetting their followees doesn’t do anything - because they’re paying attention to the NNS to collect their spam rewards.

It seems clear to me that the one and only advantage of this proposal, is the decentralization of the network through the reaffirmation from neurons, that they’re satisfied with the performance of their followee. This is something that is desperately needed, and utilized in every other form of “governance”, in which a leader is voluntary selected by the people. 


- “We can just make a new topic, copy followees, then reset old topics”

In my opinion, this doesn’t solve anything regarding decentralization, as it leaves us in an identical scenario in which DFINITY has a self assigned super majority - with no plans to see it decentralized. 

The combination of the Periodic Followee Reset Proposal & Absolute Majority Adjustment Proposal lay the groundwork for the gradual decentralization of voting power, as neurons see other parties & contributors who align with their vision over the long term. 

The combination of these proposals aims to ensure that neurons are reaffirming “Yes, “…” is the best choice for me” - rather than utilizing a set&forget mindset to collect yields, as the grand majority do. 

By reserving DFINITYs 98% super majority, under the name of “security”, you set the precedent that they’re the only ones who can identify security concerns, and make informed decisions to act upon them.

Rather than grand-fathering DFINITY into a super majority, they, like everyone else, should have to consistently show their followees that they are not only a reliable, but the best named neuron available for them. 


*I also struggle with the comment in which you say decentralization must be earned, not relinquished - however I don’t believe that needs its own explanation.* 

Thank you for continuing this discussion, as I believe this is a valid solution regarding the “design flaw” suggested by DFINITY, within your original proposal.

Thank you for continuing this discussion, as I believe this is a valid solution regarding the “design flaw” suggested by DFINITY, within your original proposal.

No problem, thanks for compiling your list of questions again as requested.

* “DFINITY is the only competent contributor to the Internet Computer - therefor we should just let them do it”
In my opinion, this is a mis-categorization of the scenario - there are many competent contributors to the Internet Computer.
[/quote]

I think you are miss-quoting me on this one.  There are definitely many competent contributors to the Internet Computer at the application level and developing critical infrastructure, but that's not relevant to the point I was making.  I suspect this is the section you were trying to reference..."...there are big gaps that need to be addressed before we should remove default following. It probably needs to be a more wholistic plan and I think the only entity that will be able to develop a plan that the community will accept is DFINITY. They have been the only contributor to the IC that has taken action that has resulted in decentralization so far and I think we should rely on them to develop a strategy that continues the progression toward decentralization without constraining them on how to achieve it."  That's a different message than your summary quote.

* “There is no incentive for other contributors to the Internet Computer”
I would again call this a mis-categorization of the situation.

This comment is rooted in my observation that people and organizations have not made any attempt to contribute at the protocol level as far as I know.  I believe it is because making that kind of contribution is real work that would take resources away from their core projects.

I am offering to write not only the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal code, but the code for the Absolute Majority Calculation & Minimum Threshold shift as well. I am not requesting anything on behalf of completing this work, as I believe it’s something that will benefit the Internet Computer, and in turn my neurons & holdings in the long run.
[/quote]
I think this is great and would like to see this kind of contribution coming from the community.  It just hasn't happened yet and I don't see it as a sustainable model for reasons described previously.

“This proposal gives DFINITY 51% of Voting Power”
[/quote]
If the Governance topic serves as an example, we saw 40% total voting power participation on Governance proposals within 1 weeks after proposal 34485 was implemented (which was the change that incentivize people to quickly take action on their Followee selection).  Then it took another 15 months to move from 40% to approx 52% participation on Governance proposals.  If DFINITY directly owns 21.2% of total VP today, then 40% total VP cast on proposals translates into 21.2% / 0.4 = 53% voting power according to your proposed definition.  I agree these are loose approximations and more people will eventually configure their Followees again.  The point I was trying to make is that DFINITY voting power will appear to go up significantly and it will lead to more community discontent.  Even if we change the threshold, it's just not good optics.  I don't think the change is worth it at this time and believe there are better ways to accomplish decentralization goals.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:13, topic:20368"]
* “Periodic Followee Confirmation only intends to address spam proposals, not decentralization”
Can you please explain to me how exactly this addresses spam, at all?
[/quote]
Spam existed because there was an imbalance between voting participation rates on Governance and voting participation rates on all other topics.  At the time, the entire daily voting reward pie was divided among all neurons that voted.  Periodic followee confirmation would have likely removed the imbalance and rewarded only neurons that were making an active decision to participate in voting on all proposal topics.  All neurons owners could make that decision, but everyone would have to take action.  The entire daily voting reward pie is no longer divided among voting neurons, which also has the effect of disincentivizing spam without affecting voting rewards for people who are passive about governance participation.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:13, topic:20368"]
It seems clear to me that the one and only advantage of this proposal, is the decentralization of the network through the reaffirmation from neurons, that they’re satisfied with the performance of their followee.
[/quote]
I still agree with this idea (as stated in the original periodic confirmation of neuron followees proposal), but I've come to believe that we need two changes to happen first...incentives to participate in the IC  at the protocol level and competency groups who pursue those incentives and achieve building a reputation as viable choices along side with DFINITY.  I understand if people disagree, but that's where my head is at now.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:13, topic:20368"]
* “We can just make a new topic, copy followees, then reset old topics”
In my opinion, this doesn’t solve anything regarding decentralization, as it leaves us in an identical scenario in which DFINITY has a self assigned super majority - with no plans to see it decentralized.
[/quote]
The intent of that idea is for it to be used only for security updates that require immediate action.  All other proposal topics would be submitted under normal proposal topics with the standard 4 day voting period.  The idea is targeted at eliminating the critical update "design flaw" that would be produced if periodic confirmation of Followees were implemented as originally written.

I don’t believe I’ve misquoted you at all - even with your expanded response, it doesn’t not change the fact that there are other contributors to the Internet Computer.

It is intellectually dishonest, and sets barriers for alternative contributors, when you say “DFINITY is the only one who should be doing this”.

I am offering to delegate my resources, from my projects, to see out the enactment of this code. I have offered to write the code for both proposals. 

You are actively trying to dissuade me, under the premise that the foundation should do it. 

This exact scenario has nothing to do with lack of desire or resources - I have offered to provide both. 


[quote="wpb, post:14, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

It is happening as we speak and you are actively discouraging the code from being written, as it’s something that should be left to DFINITY.  

You might not see it as a sustainable model, but that is how governance works; you stake, you contribute beneficially to governance, you see the value of what you’re governing increase. 

The incentivization is the longterm success of the protocol. 


[quote="wpb, post:14, topic:20368"]
If the Governance topic serves as an example, we saw 40% total voting power participation on Governance proposals within 1 weeks after proposal 34485 was implemented
[/quote]

No offence, but I still don’t think you understand how this proposal works, I’ll break down the numbers you have provided;

*There is currently ~230M Active Voting Power*
*DFINITY owns ~94.5M Voting Power*
*You claim 40% of Total Voting Power Turnout*

~230M VP * .801 = ~184.23M VP Absolute Majority Threshold

~445M VP * .4 = ~178M Alleged VP Turnout

~94.5M VP / ~184.23M VP = 51.3% Required VP to enact Absolute Majority owned by DFINITY

~94.5M VP / ~178M VP = 53% of voter turnout owned by DFINITY

I’d also like to reiterate this proposal does not affect the execution of proposals outside of super majority scenarios. 

Meaning they have 53% of we have historically seen as voter history, initially, and 51% of what’s required to enact an absolute majority. Not 53% total voting power. 

I can see what you’re saying, in which if the voting power remains within 180-230m, DFINITY would in theory hold 50%+ of voting power that is utilized. However an implementation as such, as you’ve denoted, would require extensive “notice” in various ways to neuron owners. Ideally, with the risk of losing rewards due to not voting, this would spark greater voter participation than we see in the Governance Topic today. 

However again, I’d agree it comes down to well how the confirmations are “advertised”. 
  

[quote="wpb, post:14, topic:20368"]
Even if we change the threshold, it’s just not good optics.
[/quote]

Under the effects of this proposal, DFINITY would gain ~+9% ability to enact an absolute majority, at the trade off of losing an indefinite 98% self assigned control of the entire voting power. 

I would personally argue this is much better for optics. 


[quote="wpb, post:14, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

How exactly would this have removed a imbalance? 

What you’re describing is a way to increase rewards, from what I’m reading.

If the rewards are divided amongst all neurons that vote, and you are trying to remove neurons from that pool - that just inherently increases your own rewards, and in turn the rewards of those spamming. 

I say again, if people are actively contributing to and benefitting from spam, resetting their followees does not circumvent them, but rather benefit them - as they are actively paying attention to the NNS to vote for & receive their rewards. 


[quote="wpb, post:14, topic:20368"]
but I’ve come to believe that we need two changes to happen first…incentives to participate in the IC at the protocol level and competency groups who pursue those incentives and achieve building a reputation as viable choices along side with DFINITY
[/quote]

I understand you believe that this is something that should be a paid position - everyone will have an opinion, and as I have stated, mine is that the incentivization is the growth & development of the protocol.

However, just because you believe that this should be something that is financially incentivized, does not mean you should circumvent the contributions of those who do not (you have told me to just wait for DFINITY to do it on numerous occasions).

[/quote]

Given that this proposal doesn’t address spam, but rather enhance the outcome of it - the sole benefit of this proposal is increasing the decentralization of the network. By grand-fathering DFINITYs 98% Absolute Majority, with no means to see it decentralized, it directly contradicts the main benefit of this proposal. 

Furthermore, do you believe security concerns only come from DFINITY proposals? If someone were to make a proposal to disburse all neurons - DFINITY would view that as a security concern - but it wouldn’t fall under their “Security Topic”. This is just one of many examples. 

This is again enforcing the idea that DFINITY is the only competent contributor to the Internet Computer.

You may be conflating a few ideas.  If you want to code up a change that you feel passionate about, then go for it.  I agree having passion for an idea is motivating to perform work as a volunteer.  However, before removing Followees for the All Topics catch all category, I think credible options need to exist for people to select other than DFINITY, which will only come if there are incentives to participate at the protocol level.  This will take time.  For example, Replica Version Management is a relatively new proposal topic that DFINITY set up to enable the community to review and approve IC-OS changes.  They are making a concerted effort to enable the community to decentralize decisions on that proposal topic, which falls into the All Topics catch all category.  If you want to decentralize decision on that topic, who would you choose?  DFINITY is certainly a valid choice.  Are there others?  Are those other entities known yet?  What would cause people to spend time each week building the replica and reviewing the changes outlined in the Release Notes of those proposals?  I’ve reached out to many developers trying to get people involved and most agree it’s important but don’t want to make a commitment to performing that work.  I would rather see us achieve decentralization on that proposal topic, and others that fall into the All Topics catch all category, before resetting default Followees.  In my opinion, implementing periodic confirmation as is doesn’t achieve decentralization…it just takes voting rewards away from passive investors and does nothing for active participants.

Therefor, my original response stands. There are other development groups within the IC, that have contributed reliable code to the ecosystem. While DFINITY may be the primary contributor to the IC as a network itself, that doesn’t mean you should set up barriers for contributors to begin.  

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:13, topic:20368"]
In my opinion, this is a mis-categorization of the scenario - there are many competent contributors to the Internet Computer. If this weren’t the case, we wouldn’t see so many grants from DFINITY to open-source infrastructure within the ecosystem. While there aren’t foundation alternatives yet, there are development teams, and individual developers, who write reliable code, within this ecosystem. I believe it is intellectually dishonest to say DFINITY is the only one who can, and should be contributing to code based changes via the NNS. As independent contributors is something we’ve been striving for, we should not be setting up barriers for them to begin contributing.

I understand the implications of the ideology you’ve proposed very well - you want to take rewards from those who don’t notice (as they’ve been cut from the reward pool), to increase the reward pool of those who do vote. 

If you can’t “pass the red face test” in explaining how it’s something other than this, clearly the ideology wasn’t that compelling to begin with.

This proposal isn’t advocating for the immediate decentralization of the voting power - but rather the groundwork to be laid for it. 

While I can respect that you’d like there to be other groups than DFINITY to assign voting power - that isn’t the objective of this proposal, and will be the responsibility of Named Neurons over time. 

For example, considering you feel so passionately about it, you could pursue code base topics with Synapse. 

The purpose of this proposal is to ensure the reaffirmation from Neurons, “Yes, (In this instance, DFINITY) is the best followee for me to allocate my voting power to”. 

Being that there aren’t any other known code based contributors, obviously DFINITY is going to be the first choice for the grand majority.

But to reiterate again, it’s about the gradual decentralization of voting power as neurons notice other Code Based Named Neurons that align with their stances & vision.

I find this proposal interesting but for the time being I'd feel more comfortable if periodic reset were only implemented for the governance topic, as mentioned in the other thread, and majority calculation stayed unchanged. This is mainly for 2 reasons:

- I want to see what kind of impact followees reset has on active voting power, governance topic is the perfect fit for this test as it is the topic where most stakers are active in and it doesn't result in any immediate changes. My concern is the reset could over time lower the amount of VP cast on proposals cause stakers don't know about it or aren't active enough to refresh their neuron settings in a timely manner, behaviour of a large user base is hard to predict on paper so the only way to gather meaningful data is to test it live. If active VP effectively decreases over time than the proposed new calculation for absolute majority will give Dfinity even more leverage on the NNS.

- At this point in time there are no popular alternatives to Dfinity for more technical topics so resetting followees on all of them will only be an hindrance for the users.

I agree that this would be a useful “testing grounds” in which this functionality could be tested, with minimal impact to the protocol in the instance something “goes wrong”.

I’d agree a measured testing environment is the only way to truly gauge outcome. I’d also agree that the potential lack of returning VP, *could* cause security issues - however, you’d also have to consider it’d leave us in the same scenario as we are right now - with DFINITY in control. 

With that being said, I do believe when it is time to enact a followee reset, it will be something in which will have to be vocalized by everyone in the ecosystem, through multiple platforms & communication channels - to ensure maximum voter turn out after a reset.

I’d also say that this is fair, however I think it’d have to be considered that the purpose of this proposal is the reaffirmation from neurons that “Yes, “…”  is still the best option for me to allocate my voting power too”

While it’s true that there aren’t many code based contributing named neuron’s to date, this proposal sets out to lay the groundwork to enable the gradual decentralization of voting power, from the indefinite self assigned super majority, to alternative community code based contributors. 

While this may be viewed as a “hindrance” - the fact of the matter is that you receive ICP, from your stake, as a governance reward - for actively contributing to the governance of the protocol. By enabling a set&forget mindset, with 98%+ of Voting Power indefinitely allocated to DFINITY - this is no longer a governance reward, but once again a staking reward.

This will be the result of your proposal.  You will be “taking peoples rewards” (your words) with zero benefit to people who are actively involved in governance.

The difference is the intention.

You have stated that you are intentionally going out of your way, to remove neurons from the reward pool, to thereby increase the reward pool of active voters. 

The intention of your proposal is not to reduce spam, but rather increase the rewards of those who are participating in voting.


The combination of proposals I have laid out, sets out with the intention of seeking reaffirmation from neurons, that they are content with where their voting power is allocated. It does not set out with the intention to affect rewards - however, this would be an unintended consequence, as ICP distributed via the NNS are *governance rewards*, not staking rewards. Meaning if you are not contributing to governance, you are not receiving rewards. 

An abundantly advertised semi-annual re-affirmation of Voting Power is not a large contribution to ask for.


You may not believe voting power needs to be decentralized immediately (I would lean towards agreeing), however that doesn’t change that the foundation for decentralization must be laid.

So in summary, what you want to achieve @Accumulating.icp is to steal voting rewards from passive investors by making major changes to the tokenomics in a way that has no benefit to active participants in governance and does not advance decentralization in any way.  

DFINITY will go from owning 21% of voting power to owning 45-55% voting power with your new definitions.  DFINITY will go from triggering 99.4% on proposals that fall under All Topics when they vote to triggering 98.8% of voting power on those same proposals when they vote.  The optics will go from bad to worse, but apparently that’s your intent.

Somehow you believe that decentralization is achieve by stealing peoples rewards to the benefit of no one, artificially inflating the apparent voting power of DFINITY, providing no mechanism or incentives for people or organizations to become experts who can make decisions on non Governance proposal topics, and expecting people to volunteer their time to develop code and become experts in the topics that fall under All Topics Except Governance, SNS & Community Fund.

I see your idea is a threat to ICP and do not want to see it implemented as you have currently scoped it.  I don’t trust your qualifications to solve this problem.  The solution to default following needs a more wholistic consideration than what you are offering in this proposal.

I’ve seen many ignorant comments from you in the past, @wpb , but this one tops them all. Additionally, I find it hilarious that you have yet again resorted to malding when proven wrong, rather than addressing the topic at hand (I could have sworn you usually call this ad hominem!)

[/quote]

I’m going to start here, for the sake of irony. It was just stated, by you, that *your* intention with the Periodic Followee Confirmation proposal, was to remove Neurons from the reward pool, to in turn increase individual distribution from the reward pool.

You are projecting - it has been shown that this is your intention (on multiple occasions, at that), not mine.


[quote="wpb, post:27, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

A tokenomics change, would be adjusting the inflation/deflation of ICP. This is not tokenomics related. 

This is a change in how select governance proposals are executed. 

It has absolutely no affect on the amount of ICP that is minted / burnt.


 
[quote="wpb, post:27, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

This is blatantly ignorant on your part - the benefit to governance participants, is the distribution of the **self-assigned 98%+ indefinite absolute majority**. 

I’m not sure why it is so hard to grasp, that people knowingly & willingly selecting their own followees, rather than having them assigned - directly contributes to the decentralization of our liquid democracy.

This is again, a blatantly ignorant mis-characterization of the proposal. It is almost as though you completely ignored everything I’ve said previously, and are just attempting to throw out whatever sticks. 

I’m going to reiterate this for the 4th? time, this proposal would not affect the execution of proposals outside of Absolute Majority’s. Meaning, if a proposal has, for example, 4% yes votes, and 3% no votes - this system would not apply. 

This proposal does not mean DFINITY has 45%-55% Voting Power. It means they have 51% of what is *required* to enact an Absolute Majority, in comparison to the current 42%. This occurs alongside them losing their indefinite 98% self assigned super majority. 


[quote="wpb, post:27, topic:20368"]

I’m going to reiterate, that this does not “steal” rewards. If someone does not vote, their corresponding rewards are not minted at all.

This directly incentivizes participation in liquid democracy through the reaffirmation from neurons, that they’re content with where their voting power has been (forcefully, in most instances) assigned.

The only instance in which their perceived voting power changes, is in the instance of an Absolute Majority - in which case they gain +9% VP - in comparison to the indefinite 98% they’ve assigned themselves currently. 

Which, let’s be realistic, you are the core advocate for them retaining 98% Total VP at the moment. I’m curious how that was not an artificial inflation - as they’ve assigned the VP to themselves?

[/quote]

Wenzel, I understand that you’d desperately like to be paid for your governance contributions - hence why you push so strongly for the NNS Treasury. 

However, just because you believe the only way we will see alternative contributors to the IC is immediate financial gain, does not make it the case. 

As with any DAO, the incentivization for the participation & contribution of the DAO holders, is the responsibility of the success & longevity of the DAO.

Meaning the incentivization has been cooked into the protocol from Genesis. 


[quote="wpb, post:27, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

I’m also going to have to reiterate that this is not the objective of this proposal - and is something that should be addressed individually, within its own proposal. 

This set of proposals (being the Periodic Followee Confirmation, and the Absolute Majority Weight Adjustment), set out to lay the groundwork’s of decentralization of voting power - not completely decentralize it immediately. 

The objective of this specific proposal, is to make DFINITY more comfortable with the enactment of a followee reset - as they (and you) have stated, that removing their self assigned indefinite super majority, results in security risks, as they can not immediately execute proposals. 

I am doing my part as an independent contributor, by writing the proposals, the code, and pushing the topic.


[quote="wpb, post:27, topic:20368"]

That’s perfectly fine Wenzel - I don’t trust you either.

The difference is that I don’t expect you to trust me, or want you to. 

**Verify it.** 

The good thing about ICP, as much as you don’t like this aspect, is that it is supposed to be a decentralized blockchain - I don’t need your permission to contribute.

If you would like to attempt to address any of the rebuttals I have made, to show me where I am wrong, you are more than welcome, however you have not yet articulated a credible “threat” in regards to this proposals implementation, nor do you seem to have an understanding for how the proposal works. 

I suspect this is probably the conclusion of our conversation - so I suppose we will wait to see what DFINITYs thoughts on this proposal are.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-06-06 20:49:46 UTC | #29

If we are not actively striving for means to ensure decentralization over the longterm - how do we know it will happen at all?

Just hope one day DFINITY decides they no longer want ~98% control of the protocol (as their personal voting power has decreased by ~50% over the last 2 years)? 

Or hope that they eventually decide the community is “competent” enough to identify security concerns themselves?

I’m not saying they need to lose the voting power, but there does need to be a system in place that reaffirms “yes, “…” is the best followee available for me” - rather than allowing the current indefinitely self assigned 98%+ supermajority.

This proposal aims to enable the enactment of the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal through addressing the concern raised by DFINITY - being the inability to feasibly execute an Absolute Majority after the Reset.

I’ve shown you where I believe you are wrong multiple times and each time you respond with aggressive rebuttals that are replete with false characterizations.  You seem to have no capacity for listening and accepting alternate ideas that are counter to your own.  I told you from the beginning that I didn’t want to argue with you specifically because it was predictable that this kind of interaction would come from you.  I’ve attempted to diffuse those responses throughout this conversation and have given you plenty of opportunity to simply agree to disagree.  It is impossible to have an intellectually honest conversation with you, which is really sad because you could have so much more impact if you were more diplomatic in how you treat people.  

Please move forward with submitting your proposal to the NNS.  There has been plenty of time for discussion.  I call the question.  If you don’t do it soon then I will do it for you using your original post (now is your chance to edit if needed).  Let’s formally find out where people stand.  After your proposal is complete, if it fails, then I plan to submit a proposal to rescind the original periodic confirmation of neuron followees proposal.  This will give people a new voice about whether or not the original periodic confirmation of followees proposal is still supported by the NNS and the community.  I’m actually very curious about this since the original driver is no longer relevant.

Please don’t accuse me of trying to “frame narratives”, as if you haven’t been attempting to create a narrative around this proposal;

- No Competent Community Contributors

I don’t think your original intentions regarding this proposal were ever truly a relevant driving factor for the community. As stated, this does not address spam in any form. If anything, it enhanced spam when you proposed it - as it would have removed neurons from the reward pool, and increased individual rewards. 

Now that the reward pool is a voter based reward system, this implementation does not run the risk of “stealing” rewards from others - and can fulfill its true purpose - being the reaffirmation from neurons, that they’re content with where their voting power has been assigned. 

If anything, it is a better environment to enact a followee reset now, than it would have been then. However, I too, am curious on where the NNS stands in this now.

When you intentionally cause other people to lose their rewards, for the purpose of you gaining more rewards - yes, you have indirectly stolen their rewards. 

Whether it incentivizes governance or not, if you are doing it for the purpose of removing people from the reward pool, to increase your own rewards (as you have stated), you are stealing their rewards.

This is yet another ignorant insinuated categorization of this proposal.

I shouldn’t have to explain to you how people willingly & consciously choosing their followees, rather than having them forcefully assigned, contributes to decentralization of liquid democracy. 

I also shouldn’t have to explain to you why a followee reset incentivizes people to take a more active role in the management of their neurons & followees - and in turn participation in governance. 

However, I will explain why governance participation is important, regardless of the fact that you are such a big advocate of “Governance Rewards not Staking Rewards”;

The IC distributes maturity rewards to neurons, as a reward for governance - not for staking. 

Meaning, maturity is supposed to be compensation for a contribution to the protocols governance. As genesis neurons had their voting power assigned to DFINITY, this means that many have been able to utilize a “set&forget” mindset to collect rewards - without actually participating in governance or liquid democracy in any form.

This directly contradicts the reward scheme of the IC - as these neurons are not actively contributing to governance, nor have they ever consciously contributed to liquid democracy ( ~50% of Voting Power is not utilized within governance, therefor it is reasonable to assume many of these are set&forget neurons). 

[quote="wpb, post:32, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

“Stealing” is when **I** am taking **your** rewards, as your prop would have done upon its original proposal, or like a forced NNS Treasury contribution. 

It’s not accurate to call this “stealing” as there is no beneficiary in response to people losing rewards - there is only the incentivization to begin contributing to governance, to ensure that your portion of rewards are minted.

“You have two days to stimulate the community discussion that you think needs to occur.”

Where is this rule stated? I don’t remember only having 2 days to discuss a proposal before it has to go to the NNS. I’m sure you didn’t make it up, so please refer me to the NNS proposal rules so I can see this for myself. Thanks in advance for your assistance.

FGhostwriting | 2023-06-07 10:19:48 UTC | #37

Hi Accumulating.icp. I'm not sure how this thread seems to have turned into a private battle between you and Wenzel, but I happen to like your proposal and want to add some input, if that's okay.

I, too, am concerned that the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal has never been implemented. It's a bad precedent that DFINITY can just decide that a proposal that passed is suddenly a security risk and then just not do what the DAO agreed upon. It is especially concerning with the possibility of the SEC considering ICP an unregistered security. To me, the DAO is the main thing that protects against that. But if DFINITY runs the blockchain like its own business, regardless of what the DAO decides, then it may be a little tougher to convince the SEC.

Anyway, enough about that. Here are the things I like about this proposal:

* It gets us the follower reset, abiding by the decisions of the DAO
* It still leaves DFINITY with the ability they need to take quick action for the benefit of the protocol
* It takes into consideration the fact that only about half of neurons vote while also allowing for more (or less) participation in the future. 

I do have a few concerns:

* I would like to hear DFINITY's opinion on this topic, and I'm looking forward to the response they have stated they are preparing.
* Not all known neuron teams/individuals have the technical knowledge for protocol-level decisions. If they simply decide to follow DFINITY for all non-governance/SNS proposals, would this actually change anything? It seems the average user only cares about governance/SNS, although I personally agree that decentralization needs to advance faster (I can't believe it has been two years already), especially with the government scrutiny that seems to be coming to all blockchains.

Okay, I guess that is my two cents.

I agree, not everyone at this moment will be able to contribute to protocol decision - and that is okay. It is most likely, that the majority of neurons will reassign their voting power to DFINITY - again, that is okay. The objective of the combination of these proposals is to lay the groundwork’s for gradual decentralization over time. It is not intended to immediately remove DFINITYs voting power, as I don’t disagree, they are debatably the only party developing on the protocol layer at the moment. 

It is about the reaffirmation from neurons that “Yes, “…” is still the best Named Neuron for me” - aiming to ensure truly decentralized liquid democracy.

There is no rule.  I have come to the conclusion that this is an important step for this specific proposal.  There is nothing keeping me from doing it and I plan to do it in the most unbiased way possible, but there will be a proposal so we can get a formal decision on this topic.

This forum post actually started 7 days ago and so far hasn’t sparked much feedback from anyone except me.  Normally when a proposal doesn’t generate much interest it will just die in the forum and not make it to the NNS.  That is what should happen to this proposal.  However, I find @Accumulating.icp to be like a bull in a China shop willing to wreck everyone and everything in his path.  This is clearly evident just in this forum post when you follow it from the beginning to the end, but everyone also knows his antics also carry over into other social media such as Twitter.  Many people have been the target of his attacks in the past.  He develops very strong opinions and never lets them go.  If this proposal goes to the NNS and it fails, then my hope is that it will be a clear message that he doesn't have community support and will relax his aggressive tendencies on this topic.  If it passes, then it is clearly a good idea and should continue to be part of the conversation.  Hence, I currently see no down side to this proposal making it to the NNS no matter who submits it.

I think the solution to this problem is to submit a new proposal to rescind the original proposal for this reason.  I probably should have done that a long time ago when the original driver for the proposal went away and it became apparent that there would not be any community controlled mechanisms to fund and coordinate community driven protocol level work and IC public goods.  The idea could still be part of a longer term decentralization solution, but right now the community still believes DFINITY is ignoring what the DAO agreed upon and is entitled to see it implemented.  If a proposal to rescind is approved, then the updated community decision would be that the original proposal should not be implemented by DFINITY and if it is rejected then it will be confirmation that the community still supports the original proposal and still wants to see it implemented.  Either way, we will know how the community feels about the proposal after being formally presented with the drawbacks to the proposal that were identified after the proposal originally passed the NNS.

It’s been made very clear, through both forum topics, that I will pursue this if DFINITY agrees to honour the original proposal, and pass code based changes. 

Additionally, as a “design flaw” has been cited, it’d be ignorant to begin developing the code as-proposed, without pursuing a fix.

Once we have established that;

1. DFINITY will honour the original proposal
2. There are no viable attack vectors within the proposal

I will then begin developing the code - as I am not interested in wasting my time.

I still think people will get hung up on the issue of changing the parameter to a supermajority threshold, that's a pretty major change.

My understanding is that the holdup is that DFINITY needs the ability to make immediate network changes should there be major issues, and proposals go into a waiting period before they can pass via a Simple Majority, correct?

That’s fair, and I can understand why you’d want to see the proposals separated. 

The primary purpose behind the change in threshold, is to avoid creating a scenario in which DFINITY could nearly enact an absolute majority themselves. 

Without this implementation, the stand alone proposal of changing the calculation from total voting power to active voting power, would leave DFINITYs voting power in regards to absolute majorities in the following scenario;

94.5M VP Owned by DFINITY / 115M Required for Absolute Majority




[quote="aiv, post:47, topic:20368"]
My understanding is that the holdup is that DFINITY needs the ability to make immediate network changes should there be major issues, and proposals go into a waiting period before they can pass via a Simple Majority, correct?
[/quote]

Yes, DFINITYs concern with the implementation of the Periodic Followee Confirmation, is that if they lose their Super Majority, they will no longer be able to instantly execute proposals at will.

That’s an interesting response given that you claim to be an independent contributor to the IC.  It sounds like you are planning to let DFINITY do all to the hard work.  You should at least be able to identify the most relevant sections of code that need to change and how you would change it.   

What are your qualifications as a developer?  Do we know your work?  Do you mind sharing your GitHub ID?  Please help me understand why you would be qualified to develop the code changes that you claim to be able to code.

I’ve pushed the proposal follow-up, I’m offering to write the code, I am providing potential solutions to referenced “design flaws” - all I’ve asked from DFINITY is that they;

1. Give their input & feedback on the proposed amendment to “design flaws”
2. Honour Code based changes for proposals that have passed via the NNS Governance Topic (as they’re the ones with a self assigned 98%+ super majority on code based topics)

I’m not sure how that is leaving the hard work to them..?

To be frank, while I could entertain this - I genuinely don’t owe it to you. You’ve resorted to ad hominem in response to being shown you’re wrong, time after time, while continuing to insinuate & insist counter-parties are to blame. You quite clearly are not interested in an intellectually honest conversation - but rather directly circumventing this topic. 

It’s been established you don’t trust me, and that is fine. In the instance DFINITY agrees “yes, if you wrote the Periodic Followee Confirmation & provided the code, we would prioritize its implementation”, @diegop has made it very clear, that all code based changes submit to the NNS are reviewed by DFINITY engineers.

Meaning I genuinely don’t need to “prove” my qualifications to you - the work will show for itself upon review if DFINITY agrees to pass the code if it is provided.

A few months ago, I raised the question of how emergency measures could be implemented if they had to go through an NNS vote. The response was that Dfinity had the power to push through changes in a matter of minutes. That more or less settled the issue although I did wonder if there was a situation where even a few minutes were too much.

This thread made me think back to that brief discussion:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/emergency-measures/16947

Yes, Dfinity can act quickly, but only so long as it has the ability to trigger a majority vote instantly. And, as long as it has that, voting will be heavily centralised.

I think @Accumulating.icp makes very good points, and I support his proposal, but in case it does not pass, perhaps  my earlier  proposal can be considered again in this light. The proposal is for a periodic NNS vote, say once a month, which gives Dfinity executive authority to make changes through an emergency mechanism. 

That authority could be used through a special type of NNS proposal, maybe under a new head, which the community could easily vet to prevent misuse. Dfinity's supermajority based on default following continues *only* for this type of proposal. All other kinds would involve categories where followers are periodically reset.

Giving executive authority to Dfinity in the emergency category, renewed through monthly votes, is a way of sidestepping the security risk that is preventing Dfinity from setting in motion the periodic confirmation proposal that was passed months ago. As matters stand, it is not a good look for the IC that implementation of NNS votes can simply be pushed back indefinitely.

Personally I am interested in hearing from Dfinity on this matter not Wenzel, especially given recent regulatory developments that probably make the need for this reset even more pressing. 

Everyone’s got threads and speeches about how ICP needs contributions from non-DFINITY  developers. Well look no forther, someone offered to contribute yet all we hear is crickets and Wenzel belittling him.

So let’s try and focus on actionables. Who could provide us with a statement regarding Dfinity’s stance on the reset situation? If one was already provided and I missed, I apologise and would appreciate a link.

And most importantly, If @Accumulating.icp does the work for this reset to be implemented and it passes the code review, would DFINITY accept or reject it @diegop @bjoernek?

Looking forward to having more clarity on this

I don't know why do you have any issue with Wenzel speaking for Dfinity, he clearly is not. Just because Dfinity does not get involved it does not mean that anything said that you do not agree with is taking sides with them. Both of them have good arguments and at this point it really feels like you have something personal that does not fit into the topic at hand here.

-------------------------

Again just to be clear you came at the exact end of a long thread to pick on Wenzel, timing just seems off. It has nothing to do with the ability of @Accumulating.icp being able to contribute code to governance, maybe you know him and then again maybe you don't. Personally I would argue against any code written by anyone who has put in BIO in the named neuron 20 years old.

So was I not quick enough in my replies to satisfy the criteria required for actually posting a reply?

I am over this Wenzel defocus, it’s a ridiculous waste of time as this thread shows. So let’s get back to the actual topic. I expect Dfinity would do a code review before accepting. This is obvious from my question aka “if it passes code review”.

The rest regarding age and stuff seems like your own thing to determine how it factors in your personal opinions on people’s competency.  

I’ve never met @Accumulating.icp irl or seen his work, even tho we’ve discussed governance issues in the past…but he did offer to put in the work and show us all the results for assessment which I think deserves consideration.

I want to start by saying I don’t think is an accurate characterization of Andras comment. From my observation, she is not “picking on” Wenzel in anyway, but rather attempting to redirect the conversation towards actionable ideas. 

Wenzel directly demanded within this thread that I had two days to generate a conversation otherwise he’d propose the premature proposal. I don’t think it’s fair to say the “timing is off” when people join the conversation after such a statement.

[/quote]

Since I have stated that I am willing to write the code, the issue regarding the enactment of the reset has shifted from resources, to a design flaw, to questioning the credentials of the person willing to write the code. 

This has certainly turned into whether or not alternative sources are *allowed* to contribute code based changes to the NNS, on behalf of governance proposals that have already passed. 

Furthermore, I can understand that my age raises questions for you. This was included within my named neuron for transparency, for this very reason - people should know what they’re “signing up for”. However, I believe if you take a deeper look into the ecosystem, and founding teams, you’d be surprised to learn how many young developers & entrepreneurs there are. 

I don’t think it’s a valid criticism to say “well you’re too young to be contributing code”, as I have personally asked for my work to be reviewed by the foundation. 

I’m not asking you to simply trust that I am capable of doing the work - I am asking that you verify it with code in hand.

FGhostwriting | 2023-06-08 12:48:45 UTC | #66

Dear DFINITY,

I’m placing this here in this forum post because I see this as a pivotal moment for the Internet Computer blockchain. Please excuse me if I speak in an impassioned manner, but I am passionate about this blockchain due to my respect for the vision of its founder, @dominicwilliams , as well as my appreciation for the technology of the chain and the talent of the team of chain key cryptographers who have been assembled by the Foundation.

This proposal discussion may be the most important thing ever to appear on this forum, and yet it appears to both be ignored or brushed aside by the loudest voices. And yet, I believe, when we look back at this moment, it could be when the future of the World Computer is decided.

This is no longer a post about “Waaah, DFINITY didn’t implement the thing the DAO asked for.” It is now about the future of the blockchain.

By DFINITY’s own admission, one of the primary arguments against ICP being an unregistered security is that “ICP is the utility token of the Internet Computer, which is created by a fully decentralized protocol and network.” (See the article here: https://medium.com/@dfinity/dfinity-thoughts-on-the-secs-6-june-complaint-against-coinbase-8f725d436ef0). And at the same time, DFINITY has stated that it is a security issue if the Foundation cannot make decisions rapidly without any inhibitions to their voting power. They have also proven (with this issue now being discussed - the periodic reset) that they will simply NOT IMPLEMENT any decisions that the DAO passes that they later decide they don’t like for one reason or another. So, in other words, the blockchain is actually FULLY CENTRALIZED and is run like it is a private corporation rather than a DAO with a non-profit foundation as the major contributor.

@wpb proposed above that since he was the one who made the periodic reset proposal, not fully realizing the consequences at the time, he will simply create another proposal to reverse the one that has not been implemented (“I think the solution to this problem is to submit a new proposal to rescind the original proposal”). Somehow, the idea is that this will make things all better. If DFINITY doesn’t like what the DAO decides and doesn’t want to implement it, the DAO can just pass another proposal to reverse the decision and bow to DFINITY’s will. I’m not crazy, right? Everyone should be able to see through this thin smokescreen of “decentralization” to see the man behind the curtain. This is merely a Wizard of Ozian trick to provide the appearance of choice while remaining centralized. And yet, I somehow doubt the SEC will fail to see through it.

So here is the main point:

**Either the Internet Computer blockchain is decentralized (as DFINITY claims), or it is not, and it is an unregistered security.**

In that case, the only hope for US citizens would be to sell their tokens as fast as possible at a massive loss before the token is forced to be delisted. Better to sell at $4 and take a hit than at 4 cents, which is where the token will end up if it is declared an unregistered security and has to be delisted from exchanges like Coinbase in the US.

@diegop , you can decide to hide this post using any of the usual arguments (ad hominem, straw man, bad faith, intellectually dishonest, toxic - feel free to pick any philosophical reason you like). Or DFINITY and everyone else can simply choose to ignore the problem and hope the dissenting voices dissipate over time – I certainly have no more time to give to the forums here.

But you can neither negate nor negotiate reality or the importance of this moment.

Someday, we will look back, and there will either be a World Computer, or there will not be, and this will be one of the defining moments. And if the World Computer exists, I won’t try to take any kind of credit. I’ll just enjoy it. And if it does not exist, I won’t say, “I told you so!”

I won’t have to because I just did.

Please don’t read this as passive aggressive or condescending.  It’s an honest question and I’d like to know your opinion…

How does this proposal make ICP decentralized?

Here is my opinion in hopes that it sparks deeper consideration of the consequences of this proposal…

Even if @Accumulating.icp develops the code and it is adopted, which I think would be an incredibly awesome badge of honor for him and the community, there is no net change regarding decentralization.  I think the optics of decentralization will go from bad to worse.  In my opinion, decentralization of ICP means there are multiple choices of who to follow.  Governance and SNS have already been decentralized.  What other entity is there to choose besides DFINITY on any other topic?  The only topics this proposal will affect are the technical topics.  How and why would any group exist that is competent to contribute to ICP at the protocol level on these other topics?  If these groups existed and were known to be reliable Followee selections for people to choose, then this proposal makes a lot more sense.  What mechanisms do you think exist that will lead to the formation of these competency groups?  How would removing default following on All Topics lay the foundation for the formation of these competency groups?

I’m going to respond to this, as I know @FGhostwriting doesn’t intend to. 

I’ve touched on why I personally believe this contributes to the decentralization of ICP a few times, however I believe it seems to get convoluted with the concept that this proposal should simultaneously incentivize independent contributors. 

That’s not to say that I don’t believe it would be beneficial to have a way to reward contributors (nor do I believe it is necessary), if explored responsibly, with funding coming from the right places. Just trying to make the point that these are two different topics - one being the incentivization of named neuron contributors, the other being the decentralization of liquid democracy.


[quote="wpb, post:67, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

To me, decentralization means a few things depending on the context - in relation to the governance of a traditional DAO, I would define decentralization as the lack of a central decision making entity. 

However, due to the fact we utilize Liquid Democracy, the “decentralized” aspect, is the choice in followee itself, as central decision making entities are baked into the protocol (regardless of the fact that these parties may or may not change over time). To which the grand majority of neurons have not consciously done, ever.  

Given this, I’d define decentralization within liquid democracy a bit differently, being; “the conscious reaffirmation from neurons that they’re content with the actions of their liquid democracy representative, and the assignment of their voting power”. 

Which is something we currently have never seen, as DFINITY assigned all voting power to themselves upon Genesis - without means set in place to see it relinquished.  

[quote="wpb, post:67, topic:20368"]
How would removing default following on All Topics lay the foundation for the formation of these competency groups?
[/quote]

This kind of ties back into the introduction of this post,  but I want the opportunity to go a bit more in-depth with this explanation.

The objective of this proposal is not to inspire the creation of foundational alternatives & independent contributors - although it would be an amazing side effect.  However, this is not something that will be achieved through a single proposal, but rather, is something that has to be prepared for overtime. 

While it may not have been originally intended, the core benefit of the Periodic Followee Confirmation is the reaffirmation from neurons in regards to their liquid democracy delegate - which is something that contributes to laying the groundwork for true decentralization of liquid democracy.  

Meaning this specific set of proposals, does not have the responsibility of seeing out the generation of community contributors - as it’s goal is to ensure the decentralization of liquid democracy, through the reaffirmation of voting power to named neurons. 

I hope that helps convey why I believe this directly contributes to the decentralization of the network.

What is code? Is code lines of writing in Rust and or in Motoko; or is it consciousness moving through space and time.  

When you speak of periodic timely following; what exactly is the definition of time in your code? Are you referring to every month, every 28 days, every 31 days, every 90 days (once a season)… what exactly measures the periods that you desire? A further question to you why I care about  time is an ontological question; if code is consciousness traveling through space and time; is your code driven by  something that happened in the past, present incentives from private entities or military fear of the future. 

To a farmer and a short time investor, a view time is totally different.  A farmer is more inclined to observe the natural movement of the sun to meet their need of time while a short time investor would focus on social influencers to get the right timing. How do you plan to bridge the different needs and view points of time from these vastly different perspectives. And it is not as easy as having automatic following at your or their desired time frames. The prior mechanism that was formulated by dfinity perfectly encouraged liquid democracy as users would follow who their ideologies align to; and if their beliefs ever changed they had an option of following someone else or another entity. Working class people in general are too busy to be checking who they would follow this month and keep up with your desired mechanism of active following….

[/quote]

The time period in which Periodic Followee Confirmation would occur, was defined within a seperate proposal, which was not written by me. 

The proposal referenced, passed with a periodic reset occurring on a semi-annual basis. As such, the code would be written directly aligning with the proposal that has passed via the NNS. 


[quote="JxBrian, post:70, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

Some countries choose to do their taxes on a monthly basis, others choose to do it quarterly, while many choose to do it annually. 

There won’t be a timeframe that everyone agrees with, for various reasons, however I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask for *two* governance contributions a year, in exchange for a years worth of governance rewards. Because at the end of the day,  the ICP distributed via NNS maturity is not a staking reward, it is a governance reward - meaning it’s distributed in expectation for contribution to liquid democracy - which currently doesn’t occur for the most part.

I am a working class person, as are many of the other contributors to governance. When we staked ICP into neurons within the NNS, we all knowingly made the commitment to delegate time to the governance of the Internet Computer (if we wanted to continuously receive our governance rewards). 

Furthermore, I feel as though the frequency of the reset is being exaggerated - it does not occur on a monthly basis, but rather a semi-annual - which gives more than ample notice to neurons that a reset will occur.

If you are trying to maintain the original scope of the proposal, then Followee reset would only occur if a user doesn’t reset a 6 month countdown timer before it expires.  The intent was to have an easy button that shows current followee selections and asks if they want to keep or change their selections.  They could perform this action as often as they log into the NNS dApp account if they want.  For some it may be every 6 months and for others it could be weekly.  To each their own.  Hence, the frequency of confirming followee selection is up to each individual, but the automatic reset action would occur if they let the timer expire.

Another important note is that followee selections for all neurons controlled by the same principal would be confirmed at the same time so people with multiple neurons don’t have to go through these steps for each neuron.

That is a fair point. 

However what option did they have? If you were at genesis what would you have done different? What formulas and logic would you have initiated to prevent a hostile takeover or what sequence of actions would you have taken to nature the network to its prime?

If you ever started a company; you would be aware how the process of weaning power in benefit of a project or company works. You start with 100%, share that with founders and leave room for investors. As you bring more investors into the company or project you want to keep a close eye on the trajectory and evolution of what is going on. Otherwise a small mistake would initiate a cascade of unforeseen events. 

A great project stays in the realm of mathematics, science and openness. Changes that are made to a protocol have to be studied intensively before being adopted; in particular what downstream effects would active followees have on the network. Is that any different from a subscription service? Having an idea and rushing to implement on an idea is not good enough; more research is needed. What do polls suggest; do majority of the users of IC prefer periodic following or do they prefer following someone/ entity and changing their priorities as needed. There is no need of voting on a proposal just for it to be changed in a short time frame. 

[quote="wpb, post:74, topic:20368"]
For some it may be every 6 months and for others it could be weekly. To each their own. Hence, the frequency of confirming followee selection is up to each individual, but the automatic reset action would occur if they let the timer expire.
[/quote]

Time expire? Why would their time expire when they have someone voting for them on a liquid democracy basis? Or is the new mechanism under construction eliminating liquid democracy? Does the person they follow have an option of automatically resetting the follower’s priority when the time expires? I am inclined to believe that most people would prefer just following someone and only change their choice if the person they follow starts voting on what they don’t agree on. Otherwise the notion of active followers having an impact on voting is redundant.

This is actually a common misconception - I’m not criticizing DFINITY for their choice of actions. For the most part, I’d agree with you (we’ll set aside the fact they also assigned themselves 40% of voting power, in which they directly owned), it was probably the best case scenario, that they maintained some degree of control over the network in its infancy stages. 

However, with that being said, we still need to see a system set in place, that will ensure the gradual decentralization of this self assigned 98%+ super majority.

This topic (The Periodic Followee Confirmation) has been in discussion since April 2022. It had been followed up upon multiple times, which are documented within these forums. This is certainly not rushing to implement the feature, as it’s been in discussion for over a year, and is still in active discussion, with the community & foundation - ensuring any code based work aligns with previous proposals, and defined “Design Flaws”. 

Regarding a poll, this is something that has been passed via the NNS Governance topic - so yes, a “poll” has been taken, and the NNS made its decision (being to vote in favour, and ultimately execute this proposal successfully).

I think you’re misunderstanding his comment. The “expired time” referenced, is the timeframe in which neurons must reaffirm their followees, to avoid having the followee outright reset (no active followees). 

So no, this does not harm liquid democracy. It’s enforcing the decentralization of it (being the conscious decision from the neuron, regarding who their followee is).

Could you elaborate more on the above statement. 
What I’m asking is, let’s say that someone is already participating in liquidity democracy. Under the proposal they would have to confirm that they are still following the person after 6 months..? After 1 year? What about 2 years. Would it be better if it was after 8 years?

Is what you are referring to a confirmation from the user that they still are voting through someone? 
And if so; what is the point of that considering the fact that they would choose the same person/entity in liquid democracy.

Yes, “Periodic Followee Confirmation” implies that it is a recurring functionality. So, yes, neuron’s would have to reaffirm their participation in liquid democracy at a minimum of once every 6 months, to continue delegating their voting power, and in turn collecting governance rewards. 

It quite honestly isn’t my position to determine the frequency at which the Periodic Confirmation occurs, as it has already been passed by the NNS. I am simply attempting to fulfill my role as an independent contributor by seeing out governance proposals -  which have been passed via the NNS - in the manner in which they have passed.

I’m going to quote a previous comment to @wpb , regarding why I believe this contributes to the decentralization of liquid democracy - as I believe it accurately addresses this as well. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:69, topic:20368"]
However, due to the fact we utilize Liquid Democracy, the “decentralized” aspect, is the choice in followee itself, as central decision making entities are baked into the protocol (regardless of the fact that these parties may or may not change over time). To which the grand majority of neurons have not consciously done, ever.

Given this, I’d define decentralization within liquid democracy a bit differently, being; “the conscious reaffirmation from neurons that they’re content with the actions of their liquid democracy representative, and the assignment of their voting power”.

Which is something we currently have never seen, as DFINITY assigned all voting power to themselves upon Genesis - without means set in place to see it relinquished.
[/quote]

So, in essence, while yes, neurons are likely to select the same followee - that is okay. It’s about the fact that neurons are taking an active role in liquid democracy, rather than utilizing a set & forget mindset, to simply collect staking rewards (as maturity is a governance reward, not a staking reward). 

[quote="JxBrian, post:78, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

I find this comment rather ironic, given the scenario😅  

This proposal is an amendment to DFINITYs proposed “Design Flaw” within the Periodic Followee Confirmation Proposal. Which is the fact that if followees are reset, they will lose their self assigned 98%+ super majority - with no means to get it back, and in turn control the network. 

So, I’d agree - if DFINITY wants more voting power - they should simply buy & stake more ICP. 

However, that’s not the situation we’re in, in reality. The foundation has been laid for them to pursue liquid democracy as an alternative, so they are. 

This proposal directly addresses their concerns, by doing two things:

1. Changing the calculation of an absolute majority from Total Voting Power to Active Voting Power (a rolling average across governance proposals)

2. Changing the threshold of Active Voting Power in which an absolute majority is triggered

The switch from total voting power to active voting power, aims to resolve DFINITYs fear of the inability to regain 51%+ of the entirety of voting power, after a reset. While the adjustment of the minimum threshold, aims to absolve any centralization concerns, for example, DFINITY being able to enact an absolute majority by themselves.

This is depicted within the following math, in the original post;

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20368"]
To achieve an Absolute Majority, at the time of writing, it would require ~222.5M of ~445M Voting Power. Of which, according to the IC Dashboard, DFINITY owns ~94.5M. Meaning DFINITYs personal voting power, translates to 42% of the requirement for an Absolute Majority.

Under the affect of this proposal, an Absolute Majority would require ~184M VP of ~230M Active Voting Power (this is not an accurate representation of annual average voter participation, but rather an example, based off recent proposal outcomes). Of which, according to the IC Dashboard, DFINITY owns ~94.5M. Meaning DFINITYs personal voting power, would translate to 51% of the requirement for an Absolute Majority.

This means that the amount of Voting Power required to enact an Absolute Majority, decreases by about ~40M (10% of total voting power), while DFINITYs ability to enact an Absolute Majority increases by about 10%, under the affect of this proposal.

It seems like what you’re suggesting is that instead of increasing the cost to submit a proposal, or decreasing the weighting. You want to artificially level the playing field by undoing everyone’s follower setting on all topics. Knowing full well that most VP will be left unconfigured.

[/quote]

[quote="roy23, post:5, topic:11922"]

people that joined the “8 year gang” with the promise of “passive income” now have to spend 2 hours a day reading through proposals to make an “informed decision”. better don’t go on holidays because could be you come back and find out all rules have been changed retrospectively and your staking returns have vanished.

Why not just overcomplicate everything to the point only full-time IC governance experts get any rewards at all? I have been watching this whole changing of rules the last few months and really wonder how all of this is supposed to make people stake their ICP at all. If you constantly keep changing the reward mechanism the last thing you’ll earn is trust.

[/quote]

I think it is absurd that the NNS was configured to adopt the proposal as it makes it complicated for the average investor to keep reconfiguring who they follow in order to maximize rewards. It is totally a pointless repetitive chain of events that has the potential of driving away investors.

No, this is unrelated, although I’m sure it would contribute towards helping their case against the SEC.

I personally support the Periodic Followee Confirmation, because I think it is absurd that the foundation has indefinitely assigned themselves 98%+ of total voting power, on code based topics. 


[quote="JxBrian, post:80, topic:20368"]

[/quote]

Everyone’s bound to have different opinions on the matter, and that’s okay.

However, I can say one of the quotes you have referenced, is in response to the claim that this proposal “stops spam”, which has since been solved with the weighting & proposal cost options mentioned. I’d agree with the original poster, it does not solve spam, and that reasoning alone did not justify a followee reset. 

However the fact of the matter is that users assets were manipulated at genesis when all voting power was forcefully assigned to DFINITY. This is something that needs to be addressed & decentralized over the longterm. 

I’d also say that the second post does not accurately characterized the proposal, nor where we’re at with governance today. 

This proposal isn’t requesting that people dedicate hours a day to governance, but rather find the time to log into the NNS twice a year, to reaffirm they’re content with their followee. 

Additionally, the NNS is not a “passive income”, it is a governance tool, in which governance participants are rewarded.

If an investor is knowledgeable enough to create an internet identity, a neuron, assign its followees, and spawn the rewards, I don’t think it’s an accurate characterization to say that a UI that dictates a followee reset will occur in 6 months time, if they don’t reaffirm their followee at any time within that 6 months, is creating barriers & driving away potential investors. 

I would disagree with your representation of the proposal as “a pointless repetitive chain of events”. As stated, to date, 98%+ of the entirety of voting power has been indefinitely self assigned to DFINITY. There needs to be a system set in place that ensures the gradual decentralization of this voting power over time - as it was self assigned. This proposal accomplishes that by ensuring the reaffirmation from neuron’s, that they’re content with their liquid democracy representative. 

If anything, I think the point could be made that the individual vote would matter more after this proposal, therefor incentivizing participation, rather than circumventing it.

The [original proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) about periodic followee confirmation was submitted and voted on with the main motivation to disencourage spam proposals. The proposal’s objective said *“This discrepancy in participation rates is an incentive to submit spam proposals for the purpose of receiving higher voting rewards [..] This proposal aims to remove this incentive [..]”*. Spam proposals in this context are proposals that are just sent to increase the rewards for some governance participants without having actionable content.

DFINITY voted yes on the proposal with the primary purpose of addressing spam concerns. Since the original proposal, the NNS achieved spam prevention by 1) an increase of the proposal fee and 2) adjusting the voting rewards as explained [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/financial-spam-prevention-nns-implementation-update/18917). Therefore, DFINITY no longer believes that spam, as defined above, is a concern at this time, so other areas deserve more design and engineering resources.

The [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) does provide other side effects some people like as well, but with the main motivation (spam) for it gone, it seems prudent to discuss whether it is actually the best solution for the aspects that before were more of a side-effect.

Therefore, we suggest that if periodic followee confirmation should be realized for a reason other than spam prevention, then this should again be put to voting on the NNS.

This would help with

* Understanding if the NNS voters agree with the new proposed goals.
* Understanding if the NNS voters see a need for this feature in the context of these new goals.
* Focussing the discussion on more concrete concerns and questions.

Can you please explain to me how this would have decreased spam at all? From what I’ve gathered, it was intended to directly boost the rewards of voting participants - which would have only enhanced spam (given they were active voting participants).

What you’re describing is a way to increase rewards, from what I’m reading.

If the rewards are divided amongst all neurons that vote, and you are trying to remove neurons from that pool - that just inherently increases your own rewards, and in turn the rewards of those spamming.

I say again, if people are actively contributing to and benefitting from spam, resetting their followees does not circumvent them, but rather benefit them - as they are actively paying attention to the NNS to vote for & receive their rewards.

I can add a bit to what @lara wrote @Accumulating.icp:

1. The original proposal was meant to address spam
2. Spam was reduced and became less urgency.
3. It has been a LOW priority and no resources were addressed for it because spam was not an issue
4. In parallel, there seems to have been narrative that i was not about spam, but about tactics. to improve decentralization. whether one agrees with whether those tactics were beneficial or not, those were always side effects of the proposal.

This is why you saw:

1. DFINITY and its followers voted yes
2. DFINITY did NOT prioritize it when spam was less an issue
3. A bit of surprise from my end that so many people brought up this proposal given spam was not an issue... while people focused more on the side effects.
4. DFINITY and @lara has communicated it think its best to decouple the spam and decentralization intent.

But i would put it more simply... if you or anyone wants "code it up" would they be submitting code to address spam? 

if so...why do they believe spam is an issue? 

If not... then adding code for a side effect instead of the main intent of the proposal is also a bit messy.

So because someone sees an alternative value in the proposal (of which you have acknowledged in the past), it should be voided because it does not fall within the intentions of the original proposer? If due diligence was done on this proposal, should all of these effects not have been foreseen and considered upon originally voting? Why is it that this is considered a priority & on the roadmap upon our original dialogues, yet not a priority or recognized as a necessity now?

If a proposal was made to gradually decentralize voting power through a Periodic Followee Confirmation, would DFINITY vote in favour, or vote to reject, to retain their 99% voting power?

I get the feeling this is the crux of what you're trying to find out and accomplish. With all of the baggage from past proposals, I would think it would be best to start fresh and submit a new proposal laser focused on this one issue and see what happens. 

You're asking them to tell you which way they would vote, which is never going to happen. In my opinion, it wouldn't be smart for a company to tell you how they're going to vote because in a lot of minds, that would constitute a "promise", and by the time the proposal actually makes it to the NNS, things (employees, priorities, other proposals, the market) could change for better or worse. Also, you theoretically could put a bunch of other stuff in it they don't like, and when they vote against it, throw dirt and say "you said you would yes on this." If you aren't going to code it up or submit a proposal without a firm answer on how they would vote, I don't think it will never get done. 

As I told you before, I appreciate your goal and what you're trying to do!

Says a lot about the decentralization of our blockchain, and the importance & weight of governance proposals, doesn’t it?  


[quote="jwarner, post:111, topic:20368"]
You’re asking them to tell you which way they would vote, which is never going to happen.
[/quote]

DFINITY has voiced their opinions regarding proposals and governance countless times in the past. If they’re refusing to do so now, it’s because they don’t like what the proposal would do to their influence. 

I’m asking for articulable & objective reasoning regarding why both the Periodic Followee Confirmation proposal & the Absolute Majority Adjustment proposals are invalid. 

So far, we’ve heard they don’t have resources, then there was a design flaw, now they have just decided the proposal is invalid (after stating this was a top priority Oct 2022).

Clearly this is about the fact that it jeopardizes their 99% control on the network (as they have stated in their design flaw reasoning) - not internal corporate affairs. 


[quote="jwarner, post:111, topic:20368"]
Also, you theoretically could put a bunch of other stuff in it they don’t like, and when they vote against it, throw dirt and say “you said you would yes on this.”
[/quote]

This would at least give them an articulable reason to reject. 

Ive stated that if DFINITY accepts the help, I will be writing these proposals exactly as they’re written in the proposals. 

In the hypothethical instance you state, they could simply say “he didn’t make the proposal how he said he would”. 


[quote="jwarner, post:111, topic:20368"]
With all of the baggage from past proposals, I would think it would be best to start fresh and submit a new proposal laser focused on this one issue and see what happens.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:110, topic:20368"]
So because someone sees an alternative value in the proposal (of which you have acknowledged in the past), it should be voided because it does not fall within the intentions of the original proposer? If due diligence was done on this proposal, should all of these effects not have been foreseen and considered upon originally voting? Why is it that this is considered a priority & on the roadmap upon our original dialogues, yet not a priority or recognized as a necessity now?

Just so we're still on the same page, I think you have a good idea and would love to see the proposals. 

With that said, you keep asking if they'll do it and they have now told you no, they aren't going to do it. So then in my mind, it falls on members of the community to get it done. You can say you don't want to do it because it will just be voted down until their majority changes, but their majority won't change because the proposals aren't getting submitted. So it just stays the same.

 Fair enough.

@diegop removing my posts in the name of “moderation” and adding a new context doesn’t change the underlying fact that this forum is rife with censorship, just like the network in general.


DFINITYs poor security assumptions enabled the seed investor to 51% attack a DAO and drain its treasury. Funny to me you guys try to rebrand it as something good lol

Calling me a narcissist, censoring posts and derailing the context doesn’t change the fact that this is a big Fat L that DFINITY can’t swallow. Funny how DFINITYs credibility is basically non existent. Wouldn’t be surprised if you guys rebrand the next 51% attack as some new project.


FYI I didn’t initiate the conversation with Borevan.

It’s been clear for a long time they’re not going to do it. I’ve been asking them to *allow* me to write code for the topics that have passed via NNS for them, not that they do it themselves.

[quote="jwarner, post:113, topic:20368"]

Again, this says a lot about our decentralization, doesn’t it?

- DFINITY assigns themselves 100% of Voting Power upon Genesis
- DFINITY assures this will be addressed & decentralized over time
- DFINITY decides to retain ~99%+ Voting Power indefinitely - it is the communities issue, not theirs
- DFINITY says “if you want to write it, go for it, but we’re not passing it” (even though the proposal passed via NNS once already)
- DFINITY then decides the original proposal is void, and must be rewritten and re-proposed, unilaterally

Even if I were to submit a proposal, without their permission, I am simply wasting my valuable time and burning energy.

Goodmorning @bjoernek @lara @diegop ,

I was just wondering if we can expect a reply from DFINITY regarding my previous two responses, this proposal, and in turn the decentralization of the network. Thanks

Id just lock this thread, these people will never stop their nonsense.

Ask around maybe you can buy it, just kidding. Appreciate the feedback, pretty sure it's not the nonsense you're used to but you can always apply for moderator status.
