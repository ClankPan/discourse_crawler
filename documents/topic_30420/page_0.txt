As once again, we are debating Tokenomics,

as an 8 year Neuron holder who has made some investment decisions over the past year, the frequent revisiting is tiring as well as could impact the return calculations, could it even force me out of my investment?

Now imagine a pension fund or professional investment fund, that would be intrigued to invest into ICP, to stake neurons, generate returns for its fund holders, only to see, at any given time, someone can come around and once again make a proposal and threaten the current tokenomics.
We have to limit the proposals or else, we will never secure the big players in the long run.
Thus:

1) Tokenomics should of course be open to discussion
2) Tokenomics should have the option to be changed by the DAO
3) this should only be allowed at long timer intervals

I propose, Tokenomics, which specifically impact
a) Neuon payouts
b) server node payouts
c) burning mechanisms

to be only allowed once every 4 years.
We can time it with the bitcoin halving and US presidential election period, to have all the impactful events within the same year, giving investors a little more rest during the 3 years in between.

Let the Dominic proposal play out and be voted upon, and then integrate a 4 year lock until a next proposal can be made.

I have a better proposal:
        Every time the tokenomics is changed by the DAO, everyone should be given a chance to freely change their current staking state.

Revisiting tokenomics only once every four years is a great idea. 

I also agree that if the the rewards are changed then affected participants be given the option to unstake completely at that time

Since DFINITY already made the changes 1 year ago, I assume we still have 3 more years till the next change according to this idea?



Maybe instead of changing tokenomics to manipulate the price, we should focus on decentralizing the network and onboarding more users?
