Hey all,

I've been looking at Cancan's binary relational implementation and I was wondering how is state persisted between canister upgrades?

Currently `main.go` calls these 2 functions from states but afaik they're use a base library that's not implemented.

https://github.com/dfinity/cancan/blob/main/service/CanCan.mo#L46-L52
https://github.com/dfinity/cancan/blob/main/backend/State.mo#L256-L262

I also had a look at matthew hammer's implementation, which still has stable memory as an upcoming feature
https://github.com/matthewhammer/motoko-example-20210805/blob/main/src/State.mo

If the features from the standard library aren't ready, is there a recommended way to do for now?
