# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/5c60feaf3d64a745b9a44aa61d44b91d6921541b/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 5c60feaf3d64a745b9a44aa61d44b91d6921541b
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

And this week we also have another special build with the new p2p consensus layer enabled. This feature was deployed last week to a number of subnets and performed very well.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **127461**
Vote: **ADOPT**

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @ilbert, @Gekctek, and @hpeebles.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @jwiegley and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here or in the thread of each respective proposal in our community on OpenChat if you have any questions or suggestions about these reviews.

@nikola-milosa @eichhorl 

I just wanted to ping you about questions [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/3858240d4#r137943977) and [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/76f5ebf17#r137945307) on GitHub that @cyberowl posed regarding commits [3858240d4](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/3858240d4) and [76f5ebf17](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/76f5ebf17), respecively.  Here is a direct [link](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/39/9?open=true) to his review.  He is concerned about the wrong ordering for an Error log as well as the wrong error for `api_bn_id`.
