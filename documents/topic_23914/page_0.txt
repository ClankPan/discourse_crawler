Seems like a big deal. Low key post. Reason to celebrate? Well done.

What's the use, can people who know how to talk about it?What can I do after icrc_2 is enabled?

You can approve a canister or principle to spend your ICP tokens. It really improves the flow of commerce because the the canister can take your tokens in the same atomic action as the service it provides.

Currently you have to deposit your tokens in the canister and the canister has to implement a refund mechanism to handle errors...it won't know about your deposit, so it becomes a three step dance.

The proposal was accepted, the ICRC-2 endpoints are now available!

Hello! 

I'm curious if there is an error in the ledger canister archive DID file not being updated with the new struct for approve transactions? 

Ledger version of Approve
```
  Approve : record {
    fee : Tokens;
    from : vec nat8;
    allowance_e8s : int;
    allowance : Tokens;
    expected_allowance : opt Tokens;
    expires_at : opt TimeStamp;
    spender : vec nat8;
  };
```
Archive (qjdve-lqaaa-aaaaa-aaaeq-cai) version of Approve
```
    Approve : record {
        from : AccountIdentifier;
        spender : AccountIdentifier;
        allowance_e8s : int;
        fee : Tokens;
        expires_at : opt Timestamp;
    };
```

Our 221Bravo ICP index canister has just hit a wall as "allowance : Tokens;" is not present in the data returned from block 6981590. I'm wondering if allowance should be opt Token to allow the archive canister to upgrade.. or whether there is actually two types of approve blocks (old and new)?

Will the difference in structs/ records cause issues when sending new style approve txs to the archive canister? What record type should I use when fetching data from the ICP ledger to ensure I can get archive + current blocks. 

Thanks,

We are going to upgrade the archive to fix this. Thanks for reporting it @NS01 .

-------------------------

mariop | 2023-11-08 10:00:13 UTC | #9

The [first archive](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/qjdve-lqaaa-aaaaa-aaaeq-cai) is fixed @NS01 but in the weekend the ICP Ledger spawned a second one and that one is also with the old interface. There is a proposal that closes tomorrow to fix the interface of the new archive too.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-11-08 14:25:35 UTC | #10

Oh man...now I need to go check my code to make sure I handled multiple archives. :grimacing:  Might be worth a PSA.  I know a lot of code out there handled the deposit flow and may have only assumed one archive canister.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-11-08 22:06:09 UTC | #11

I'm hoping that the design we've got will work with either now. I'll keep an eye on it to see if it hits a brick wall. 

Thanks for the heads up :slight_smile:
