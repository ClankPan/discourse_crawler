What I am really hoping for here is for the vision in this Tweet by Dominic to be achieved: https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1393268099109965826?s=20

He mentions that the IC will be a giant DNS server. I really think that vision is compelling, and the IC could become possibly the most secure DNS server ever to exist.

Perhaps there are multiple iterations to enabling custom domain names, but I do not think we should compromise on the eventual direct integration of DNS with the IC.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-08-16 21:52:38 UTC | #3

Instead of calling these vanity URLs, I would suggest naming this improvement "custom domains".

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-08-16 21:56:20 UTC | #4

Great idea. @Jan @samuelburri what do you guys think?

-------------------------

jfw1987 | 2021-08-17 10:28:06 UTC | #5

I'm not sure why this isn't a priority. In my opinion it should be the next thing on the the to do list. Calling it vanity URLs is really odd and dismissive of how important it will be for adoption.

-------------------------

nomeata | 2021-08-17 12:38:29 UTC | #6

Given that much of our civilization is built on vanity (think of early long distrance trade that was mostly fueled by vain demand for odd spices and ornaments), “vanity URL” doesn’t sound bad to me :smiley: And the end user doesn’t care how that feature is used.

Strawman proposal:

 * Build a simple “name registry canister” that stores “vanity name, controlling princpal, current destination” triples
 * Provide a query interface to get the current value, and include a certificate that proves that the returned value is correct (or that the requested name is _not_ registered.)
 * HTTP Gateway / service worker use that query to look up (and cache) the canister to talk to.
 * The controlling principal can change the destination, and also change the controller to someone/something else
 * Scaling beyond 4GB is done via [extending the stable memory](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increased-canister-storage/6148); query throughput scaling is handled by the subnet. This way this can be stay one canister for a long time, which is simple, reliable and robust.

That’s the easy part. Tricky parts are, probably:

 * If registration is first-come-first-service and free or cheap, will there be bad name grabbing?
 * Do we need a NNS proposal to transfer ownership, e.g. if someone got a trade name?
 * Do we need configurable caching policies, like in DNS?
 * Do we need a bridge into real DNS? (I don’t think we need that with the current architecture with Gateway nodes.)

I certainly think this should be a top priority. Hard to build truly decentralized projects if we’re relying on Google or Amazon for edge nodes to route traffic from custom domains. 

I second the idea that we need to refer to them as “custom domains” and not vanity URLs. 

Bypassing traditional DNS seems important for true decentralization. I’d love to see Don’s full vision of the chain acting as a DNS.

> I’m not sure why this isn’t a priority. In my opinion it should be the next thing on the to-do list. Calling it vanity URLs is really odd and dismissive of how important it will be for adoption.

Fwiw, I did not name this, but "dismissive" was not the intent when I heard this. So if that is how it is landed with people, then maybe renaming it "custom domains" (as @lastmjs recommended) makes more sense.

-------------------------

BrianGaller | 2021-08-18 02:45:14 UTC | #9

I get that IC is "bleeding edge" and that the current URLs is one of the sharp edges. However, it's the first impression we are making to those not familiar with the IC yet. As others have mentioned, custom URLs are key to wider adoption by those that don't care as much about the tech, but are just coming for the apps/services.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-08-23 20:26:11 UTC | #10

Follow up: Based on feedback on this thread, we changed the name of the project from "Vanity URLs" to "Custom Domains" to better reflect its intent. We are still discussing how to staff and better engage on this thread, but you should know we (including the lead @jplevyak ) are monitoring the thread.

-------------------------

treb0r | 2021-08-25 07:51:28 UTC | #11

Speaking as a web developer who is planning to move everything away from the legacy cloud and onto the IC, this is of crucial importance.

I saw Dominic say that the current canister derived domains are good because they let people see that the website or service is hosted on the IC rather than AWS. I think this is a mistake.

Custom domains and SSL are key for those of us who actually want to start moving client websites onto the IC. 

Once we have this working we can turn our attention to building new canister based static site generators and content management systems.

-------------------------

B01AND | 2021-09-10 11:47:59 UTC | #12

As an ex corporate digital strategist I also agree that this and the web assembly OS are extremely important. 
I would like to see this being made a top priority. 

Fleek is a great first step but let's take it all the way 🥳

Fred | 2021-09-11 18:49:34 UTC | #13

IC Novice here.

Based on the conversation it seems like the assumption is that ic0.app is intuitive - have to be honest here - I don't even know how to pronounce ic0, and I don't know what the "0" represents.  Anyone who has never used the internet computer is going to have at least some lever of discomfort with the ic0.app.

I agree the custom sub domain names are an improvement, but seems like it would be easy to improve on the domain.  Can the community petition ICANN for a new gTLD such as .ICP?

Good question. I will ask team

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-09-15 12:48:36 UTC | #15

I was under the assumption that this feature was meant to support completely custom domains (like demergence.org, stoicwallet.com). Has that been changed? Are we only shooting for custom subdomains on ic0.app?

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-09-15 13:09:26 UTC | #16

I have the same impression as you, Jordan… but when I wrote above I realized that I had always *assumed* it, I didn’t actually ever asked anyone *explicitly* it.

I pinged folks who know more than me to get an idea of the theoretical state of the world to make  sure I’m on same page with what’s possible snd/or reasonable.

-------------------------

treb0r | 2021-09-20 13:10:25 UTC | #17

Are we going to get the chance to vote on this? What would it take to get a formal proposal submitted to the NNS?

-------------------------

AndyBrier01 | 2021-09-21 09:38:18 UTC | #18

Annoying as it sounds it is very unlikely any new TLD such as .ICP will be allowed by ICANN as a one-off. It will have to be applied for (along with many other hundreds and possibly thousands of applications) in the second round of new TLDs. Applications for the first round of new TLDs (like .APP and .BIKE etc) were opened early 2012 and the first approved new TLD went live for general use in Feb 2014, 2 years after applying. Applications for the second round won't go ahead until ICANN has given the go ahead to the process, which it hasn't yet. According to reports the ICANN board will not approve the second round until Q2 2022 at the earliest. With improvements to the application process and assuming Dfinity gets the string (they will be competing against other applicants) it is unlikely .ICP will be available for actual use until Q3/Q4 2023. Even then this is a very optimistic timeline, ICANN is notoriously slow and bureacratic.

Custom sub-domains (subdomains*.ic0.app) could be the way to forward in the meantime. Perhaps with a process for Dfinity approved custom sub-domain holders having rights to the matching .icp when it is live (to give some continuity in naming).

Other considerations include whether .ICP would be the right string to apply for and also whether ic0.app is the right root domain for the custom sub-domains (removing any barriers to adoption should be the key). 

Note: The domain ic.app is already registered (Jan 2021) and it's unclear whether this is owned by Dfinity. Not criticising the choice of ic0 but ic would have been ideal as the root for sub-domains (avoiding the 0). Although I don't know enough about IC's structure how big a change this would be. Or whether ic.app (or some other IC root) could be run in parallel to ic0.app.

-------------------------

treb0r | 2021-09-21 12:47:00 UTC | #19

I need to be able to use any GTLD that I choose, just like I can with AWS etc.

This is a major stumbling block for me and more importantly, my clients.

-------------------------

nomeata | 2021-09-21 14:42:21 UTC | #20

I am trying to remember why you can't simply set a CNAME from your domain to `<canisterid>.ic0.app`, and the relevant components (boundary node and certifying service worker) will query DNS to read the CNAME to get the canister id to resolve to…

Ah, there is TLS. The boundary node would have to aquire a certificate for that domain on the fly. But is that a problem these days, with letsencrypt being a thing?

And then there is the problem that top level domains can't be CNAMEs. How about a `TXT` entry then?

Of course, NIH'ing some completely new system, nicely on chain with governance and everything would be fun. But to move the IC forward and make it usable with arbitrary domains, just matching what, say, GitHub Pages has been supporting for a long while, maybe be prudent? And it only affects the two boundary components.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-09-21 16:07:13 UTC | #21

I've used https://github.com/auto-ssl/lua-resty-auto-ssl on some SaaS projects that need custom domains.  It is Lua and nginx...I have no idea what DFINITY uses on the nodes.

-------------------------

codi0 | 2021-09-21 16:23:32 UTC | #22

Only re-iterating what others have already said, but would be in favour of:

- Being able to point any domain name to a canister
- Only implementing custom subdomains as an interim if there are significant technical barriers to the above
- Not sidetracking things with the .icp TLD (it suggests vendor-lock, which is not a good thing IMO)

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-09-23 18:03:01 UTC | #23

Regarding the first two bullet points in the Tricky Parts section:

Public announcements of the IC's DNS developments and several notices before launch +  perhaps incentives for IC ecosystem participants (stakers, etc.) would be the most legitimate foundation for how to do it, in my opinion. 

**Or**...maybe have the community vote through the NNS on whether to do a set of customer Canister names that are auction-only -- auction would be priced in ICP and be held for the first X days after the system is live. 

What I think you don't want to have happen is to turn the entire DNS into a bidding war, but for some names like the subset you seem concerned about, the auction idea is worth considering. Some component of first come first serve needs to be in there.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-09-23 20:41:04 UTC | #24

Arbitrary domain names please, and if extremely difficult subdomains only as a temporary solution.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2021-09-24 01:55:40 UTC | #25

Hey!

This is the creator of ICME. People keep asking me about how to setup their own domains.
CNAME: if this worked it would be great. 

Currently doing A NAME records to point to the 'vanity' IC URLs :rofl:

This is of great importance to get resolved. For SEO, and normal people being able to find and remember their favorite IC apps. Think of the use case from a blogger, EC site, etc, if no one can find their product or easily forget the URL **they do not get business**. Many want to transfer over to the IC, but cannot if their sites vanish from the web. SEO and domains are very important to most people.

They do not care about the tech to get it done, they care about their bottom line.

Really good suggestions above. Having CNAME work for any domain would be ideal. Heroku has some setup which seems similar to me. They have arbitrary domains names for apps. something.heroku.com. You can add a custom domain name: mysite.com. And then apply SSL that they do for you.

After that you just point a CNAME record to something.heroku.com

-------------------------

Amen. I don't know why this seems to be a controversial idea..

jplevyak | 2021-10-05 22:10:47 UTC | #27

Custom domains are going to happen, it is just a question of when.  In the meantime it is possible to set up your own via simple free static hosting e.g. https://github.com/jplevyak/icfront. Stay tuned for a proposal.

-------------------------

LowFreeKey | 2021-10-10 20:57:38 UTC | #34

A bit late to this thread but here's my two cents. 

As a developer there are more technical priorities than custom URLs. 
However having spoken highly of the IC and showed about a dozen friends website such as DSCVR the returning theme is the "suspicious/scammy look" of the current URLs

Overall for proper "mass" adoption custom URLs will be an essential stepping stone.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2021-10-13 11:50:04 UTC | #35

I don't see `nice-name.ic0.app`, user-supplied custom domains, and full DNS served by the IC as mutually exclusive – I think they extend or complement each other. `nice-name.ic0.app` is technically easier to achieve than arbitrary custom domains for the reason @nomeata pointed out: TLS and certificate handling. `nice-name.ic0.app` essentially lets us use the existing certificates, at the cost of handling sub-domain name registration on the IC as stated by @nomeata above.
@jplevyak's _IC front_ tooling is certainly a great step forward for projects that anyway assert centralized control over their canisters – which I believe are most projects on the IC at the moment – as those can use the tools to have custom domains right now. At least it can be a stepping stone until the IC properly serves custom domains. Using these tools won't really be an option for Open Internet Services, though, since IC front itself will still need to run in some centralized setting.
Serving DNS from the IC is certainly a great long-term goal, but doing this in a way that is both decentralized and secure requires a few components that we're still building – such as threshold ECDSA signatures.

-------------------------

nomeata | 2021-10-13 13:18:02 UTC | #37

It might be worth pointing out that custom domains (`nice-name.com`) are in some sense _easier_ than `nice-name.ic0.app` domains: With nice names, we’d have to build a registry with canister mapping, ownership, etc. Not hard, but a big load of bikeshedding to be done, with many cooks involved.

But with custom domains, the registry exists already: DNS! A `TXT` record in the `nice-name.com` DNS record can tell the HTTP Gateway (or service worker) which canister to forward to, and maybe whether it’s raw or certified. So assuming the TLS problem can be solved easily (automatic letsencrypt certificates), this seems to be easier in reach than nice subdomains. And _much_ more impactful, I guess.

So it might be a fallacy to consider custom domains an extension of nice name subdomains, and thinking of it like that might block us from the actually easier path forward.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2021-10-13 20:49:59 UTC | #38

You're right in that there is no strict order on the difficulty of building the first two. Solving the TLS problem is one project we're actively working on, but we also know that a solution that we find acceptable from a security standpoint will still need a bit of time.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2021-10-13 21:55:54 UTC | #39

I see this as a moot discussion. The solution is obvious. Once Threshold ECDSA is implemented, we can just build the ACME protocol (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) into the Gateway nodes, and they will be able to participate directly in the X.509 certificate process. The CA (Let's Encrypt in this case) would simply see the boundary node as the correct endpoint, and the boundary node would get a valid LE cert for any domain managed by the IC. I hope this makes sense. It does in my head. This is the explanation of how it works right now (https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/). The "Web Server Admin Software" could just be replaced with "IC Boundary Node."

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-10-14 16:44:13 UTC | #40

I don't think the boundary nodes would do this, I don't think they participate in consensus thus will not have access to the threshold ECDSA. But I imagine some canister system will be implemented to handle certificates.

What would be with `Principal`s?
Lets say now I have raw domain `https://aaaa-bbbb....cccc.raw.ic0.app` domain --> then custom domain `https://my-domain.app` - by logging in with InternetIdentity will I get the same `Principal`?

No. The Internet Identity cares about the hostname only. If you need to migrate users, you'd probably have to add code to your service that securely correlates old and new principal.

brigon | 2021-11-30 16:14:13 UTC | #47

Why not just integrate Handshake Protocol? And have decentralized tld,s for all.

-------------------------

brigon | 2021-12-10 19:04:52 UTC | #48

What would it take to setup something like ens.domains on the ic? Decentralized domains on [handshake](https://Handshake.org) protocol could be easily used imo.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2021-12-11 07:16:53 UTC | #49

NNS does not have control over the handshake network, which is intolerable

-------------------------

brigon | 2021-12-11 10:23:33 UTC | #50

Yes, but why should it have control? Much the same as with bitcoin integration, also no control.
All decentralized naming could be controlled by nns or an sns.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2021-12-11 21:30:05 UTC | #51

The IC is functionally a superset of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The integrity of the IC can also be guaranteed without them. Decentralized domain names are an integral part of ICs, and I don't think the community will allow ICs to rely on something we can't control.

-------------------------

toby2911 | 2021-12-12 01:39:53 UTC | #52

Although they are vanity to an extent, I do believe they will be crucial for mainstream adoption of the ICP. It will provide users of Web2 with the security that they are interacting with a safe website.

-------------------------

brigon | 2021-12-12 07:26:00 UTC | #53

Mostly agree, as they are all blockchains.
If decentralized domain names are integral part, let's see how the IC "Controls" it when Google's tld .app goes down and takes all IC with it.

-------------------------

harrylaulau | 2022-01-22 03:18:40 UTC | #54

Perhaps this is an elementary question, but what is the difference between making a query request to the first URL versus the second?

1. https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.ic0.app/api/v2/canister/erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai/query
2. https://boundary.ic0.app/api/v2/canister/erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai/query

@yotam, I wonder if you happen to know.

-------------------------

PaulLiu | 2022-05-21 05:06:44 UTC | #58

Nothing. Because they point to the same set of servers.

But really, it should always be https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai/query

Many people probably don't realize this, but DNS lookup is very slow when the domain was not already in browser cache or some caches along the path. Always open developer console and double check. If you see anything that is not https://ic0.app (besides the main domain of the page), there is room for improvement.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-21 05:18:57 UTC | #59

Interesting, that's strange how the docs and other forum posts reference those full domains...

-------------------------

ovictor | 2022-06-06 20:02:32 UTC | #60

A simple way to solve this problem for now is using AWS cloud Front Distribution, you can distribute yourcanister.raw.ic0.app using your own domain.

-------------------------

vavram | 2022-06-06 20:45:57 UTC | #61

Using any kind of AWS component defeats the very purpose of hosting on IC.

-------------------------

ovictor | 2022-06-06 21:07:30 UTC | #62

While IC does not support it, why not? There is no way IC APP scale to general public without a custom domain.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-06-09 22:24:49 UTC | #63

I recall this was blocked by decentralized TLS certificates (or something like that). Is that still the case? I'm curious what the current state of this is.

Decentralizing boundary nodes needed to decentralize TLS certificates. I see a connection to custom domains, but they are separate goals. That was the state a few weeks ago, but since then the team has been looking at this deeper, let me see if anything has changed

faraz.shaikh | 2022-06-10 18:28:36 UTC | #65

Hey, 

Custom domains have a few prior milestones that need to be met. While we focus on these prereqs the design for custom domains remains fluid. 

As per the latest design we don't need MPC TLS for custom domains. We are working towards a design where end-user can manage their TLS certs using dfinity-provided software. 

Reminder: this is still in the design phase and the current focus is on laying down the groundwork for community-maintained NNS-governed boundary nodes first.

Hi, guys, while the custom-domain does meet some requirements, I think it would be useful to be able to customize the canister URL directly. Does dev team have any follow-up plans for this issue.
For example, when a user visits our service, we want to provide the canister URL directly and make sure that the front-end page is secure. With custom-domain,  the user still needs to make sure that the request is forwarded to the correct canister.

Hi clar, do you mean with "customizing the canister URL" that a dev team should be able to create `anything.ic0.app` instead of the `<canister_id>.ic0.app`? 
Right now, I don't see how custom domains and custom canister URLs differ from the users' perspective. In both cases, they have to verify that the traffic is actually forwarded to the correct canister (`<canister_id>`).

-------------------------

clar | 2022-09-20 09:32:27 UTC | #73

Yes, we want to create `anything.ic0.app`. Using custom-domain, we created an example website (https://domain.pangdao.org/),  the request is forwarded to https://ucji4-cqaaa-aaaaj-azppq-cai.ic0.app/.

From user's point of view, pangdao.org domain name service providers, or pangdao.org operators, can attack users by modifying the domain name resolution.
If custom-url is supported, then the URL is officially bound to a specific canister, which can not be maliciously modified and is readable.   （Though users still need to trust that ic0.app is secure）

Have there been any updates on this topic?  I believe it to be mission critical for widespread adoption.  Would it be worth pursuing an NNS resolution to raise this issue's visibility for DFINITY and roadmap positioning? There are AWS based solutions that patch the issue, but in a non-decentralized ways. Fastblock's need for these features has raised the issue again.

diegop | 2022-11-04 19:13:10 UTC | #75

I don’t have a concrete update myself, but I have pinged some folks in RD to post an update. I know they have been working on it.

Hi folks, to give a little update, we are actively working on the custom domains feature.

What I mean here by "Custom Domains" is that, you will be able to configure a DNS name to point to a canister **without** having to host a custom service worker as described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/deploy/custom-domain/). 

The way it will work is that a developer can set their DNS name to point to the boundary nodes. Boundary nodes will generate an SSL certificate (through the letsencrypt DNS challenge) and maintain a mapping of name to canister so they know how to route traffic.

While this is not as decentralized as we would like (because the DNS record could be changed by the owner to point somewhere else) it is not worse than the solution above. On the other hand, it has the advantage of lowering the barrier to entry because:
* Infrastructure to serve the service worker is not required.
* maintaining a custom version of the service worker is not required.

This is a first step and IMO will help inform a design for more decentralized naming. Of course we're open to suggestions from the community and I'd be happy to setup time to chat and hear out some ideas.

Will subdomain forwarding be supported by this new feature?

I’m currently hosting a custom service worker through Firebase, and they also allow subdomain redirects via DNS A records.

I need to do this because at the time I couldn’t find a solution that allowed me to use a custom domain with a single canister entry point.

See here for details on that:

https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/discussions/2638

This feature of Firebase allows me to redirect https://git.codebase.org to https://w7uni-tiaaa-aaaam-qaydq-cai.raw.ic0.app

This means people can do:
```
git clone https://git.codebase.org/@paul/hello-world.git
```

I believe this works because Firebase has the certificate. At first I tried this using a CNAME but ran into TLS issues and my domain name got flagged for phishing.

@raymondk @diegop thank you both for the ultra-fast response on this! Appreciate the ICP blockchain speeds with which you jumped on this topic.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2022-11-06 15:48:37 UTC | #79

Hi @paulyoung, our current plan is to start with a 1:1 mapping of DNS Name to CanisterID
If I understand your use case you should be able to map:
- codebase.org to a canister
- git.codebase.org to another canister

Happy to chat with you to understand if that is actually helpful for you or if we can help in some other way. FTR I saw you demo codebase at some point and it was really impressive :rocket:

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-11-06 17:07:26 UTC | #80

Thanks @raymondk. That should at least allow me to do what I’m doing now with Firebase.

Do you have an estimated time when this will go live?

-------------------------

raymondk | 2022-12-17 03:22:45 UTC | #82

We're actively working on it. I expect we will have something to preview in early January.
We might need some volunteers to try out the first versions - if anyone is interested maybe we can partner up.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2022-12-17 05:31:04 UTC | #83

I volunteer as tribute.

Any updates here, custom URLs

 CoinMarketCap+CoinGecko for internet computer projects which are tokenised are also a must have

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-01-23 16:37:52 UTC | #85

Hi memetics, you might want to join this [week's global R&D meeting](https://internetcomputer.org/live-sessions#Global-RandD-Meeting-January-2023).

-------------------------

diegop | 2023-01-23 18:47:50 UTC | #86

@memetics 

Thanks for asking. As @rbirkner alluded to, there will an update at the public Global R&D on wednesday.

-------------------------

bytesun | 2023-01-29 16:41:03 UTC | #87

no Q&A, so ask here, by using this configuration,  do we still need to configure Alternative Origins to keep the same principal?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-01-30 09:08:26 UTC | #88

Hi @bytesun,
The alternative origins are independent of whether you use a custom domain through the boundary nodes or not. This means you will still need to configure the alternative origins.

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-02-28 12:00:09 UTC | #89

Hi everyone,

We are happy to announce that the long-awaited [custom domains feature](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/) has been released.

While it has always been possible to host your canister under a custom domain, it required operating your own infrastructure up until now. With this feature, all you need is to obtain a domain (e.g., `foobar.com`) from your favorite registrar, configure the DNS records and notify the boundary nodes, which take care of the rest, namely managing the certificate and routing traffic to the right canister.

These two approaches differ in their ease of use and configurability:

* Running your own infrastructure gives you maximum control, but you need to provide and maintain all the infrastructure yourself.
* Registering the domain with a boundary node, allows you to rely on the existing, geographically distributed boundary node infrastructure.

You can find all the instructions on how to register your domain with the boundary nodes in the [developer docs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/#custom-domains-on-the-boundary-nodes).

We are looking forward to all your domain registrations and your feedback!

skilesare | 2023-03-10 16:13:32 UTC | #90

Can we serve raw through this?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-03-10 16:27:48 UTC | #91

Hi @skilesare 

You cannot serve raw through a custom domain. The custom domain endpoint behaves the same way as if you would target `<canister_id>.ic0.app`: the service worker is served and SEO is enabled by passing request from crawlers to raw internally.
