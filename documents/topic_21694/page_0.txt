I specified a giant amount of cycles (for local testing) for `stresser` canister:
```json
{
    "canisters": {
      "stresser": {
        "main": "motoko/main.mo",
        "type": "motoko",
        "cycles": 100000000000000000
      },
      ...
```

Nevertheless, when I run it, cycles are not enough. What is my error?

```
$ make
dfx deploy stresser --with-cycles 99000000000000000
Deploying: stresser
Creating a wallet canister on the local network.
The wallet canister on the "local" network for user "default" is "bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai"
Creating canisters...

Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.

    Failed to create canister 'stresser'.
      The replica returned a replica error: Replica Error: reject code CanisterError, reject message Canister bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai is out of cycles: requested 99_000_000_000_000_000 cycles but the available balance is 99_998_729_277_381 cycles and the freezing threshold 173_237_730 cycles, error code None
```

A typical fragment of code of `stresser` canister:
```
Cycles.add(1_000_000_000_000);
await options.index.createSubDB({guid; dbOptions; userData = ""});
```

My question, put short: How do I increase the amount of cycles that I can use (in local deployment)?

OK, but **why** my configuration with `"cycles"` in `dfx.json` didn't work?

Is this even a valid property? 

I can't find it in the reference https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/dfx-json-reference
