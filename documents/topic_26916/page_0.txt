It's probably a stupid question but, out of nowhere, I have a doubt for no reason.

Can a canister that holds some wasm code as a blob (e.g. `Vec<u8>`) and calls `install_code` targeting another canister install more than 2 MB?

It's possible, but some work would need to be done, in comparison to DFX, which will handle the chunked upload for you. You need to use [install_chunked_code](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-install_chunked_code) after [upload_chunk](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-upload_chunk).

Thanks Nathan so, to answer concretlly my question: if a canister holds e.g. 5mb of wasm it cannot call `install_code` targeting another canister because as for any `install_code` it will hit the 2mb message limitation. Correct?

In other words, regardless where you call `install_code`, the 2mb limit absolutely always apply.

Yes there is still the 2mb message limit on `install_code`. The same is also true for `upload_chunk` and `install_chunked_code`.

A 5mb WASM would need to be uploaded with 3 separate calls (each less than 2mb) to the target canister's blob storage using `upload_chunk` and then installed using `install_chunked_code`.

Thanks for the confirmation. I don't know why I had some doubt but, "there is no such thing as stupid question" isn't ;) .

IIRC the 2mb limit is only there for ingress messages and cross-net calls, if a canister calls another canister in the same subnet then the limit is 10mb ([source](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/resource-limits)).

Nice, I didn't know about that. Thanks!

Thanks Kepler, that's good to know!

Btw. `install_chunked_code` is also limited to 10mb right? Looks like it is not documented on the website. `MAX_CHUNKS_IN_LARGE_WASM` and `CHUNK_STORE_SIZE` are referenced but their effective values is not displayed unless I missed an information :man_shrugging:.

Each chunk must be at most 1MiB. That is documented [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-upload_chunk). But ideally this would be added to the resource limits table as well.

Additionally, not mentioned in the spec: The resulting wasm must be at most 100 chunks / MiB, with the additional restriction that the code section must be no larger than 10MiB. But this leaves room to bundle in assets and metadata larger than 10MiB.

@bogwar: Could you please confirm the above numbers?

Thanks @frederikrothenberger; the limits are indeed as you stated them. I'll see it to add the limits to the resource limit table.
