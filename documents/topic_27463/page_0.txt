I'm using some app outside of IC network and want to setup some key which a hardcode secure key for calling the canister. 
So is the code of canister is private, if not what approach should I follow to setup a key in secure way.

Data on ICP is private to the public by default, but there are (still) ways for the machines that execute your code to read memory. So I'd personally be okay with storing keys worth a few hundred dollars in memory
