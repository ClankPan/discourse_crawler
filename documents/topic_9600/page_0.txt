There is a function button to join the community fund in NNS. The community fund previously stated that it will be used to exchange for a pack of virtual coins. In the future, can you know how many ICPs we have consumed, exchange charts of those virtual currencies, and the main investment areas? In addition, in the future, will NNS have other organizations similar to joining the community fund?
