# Project highlights
[This](https://github.com/vporton/passport-client-dfinity) is a sample app to securely copy anti-Sybil personhood data from Gitcoin Passport and store it in an ICP database.

Securely connect Gitcoin Passport to ICP. Store the user data in [CanDBMulti](https://mops.one/candb-multi).

# How to install
You need to edit the project source to match DB storage for your app. After this you should develop an installer that installs the modified Gitcoin Passport Client together with your app.

# Usage Example
For a social network [Zon](https://docs.zoncirlce.com) it will be used for anti-Sybil voting for the order of posts and post content. In Salaries Science grants system it will be used the same way as in Gitcoin.

# Documentation
See in the source and at https://mops.one/passport-client/docs

# Dependencies
* [CanDBMulti](https://mops.one/candb-multi)

# License
Apache 2.0

# Internet Computer superpowers
There is used ICP/ETH integration to copy data from Ethereum ecosystem securely.

# Go-To-Market strategy
By using the site https://internet-computer.vporton.name

# Status of the project
This software is considered released for usage.

# Resources
* https://mops.one/passport-client

# Future Plans
* Maybe create a standalone dApp that could be queried as remote IC calls.
* Need to also integrate it with Gitcoin Passport directly, to use Internet Identity in Gitcoin Passport, but that's hard because we need advanced cryptography in Python, that was not yet developed.
