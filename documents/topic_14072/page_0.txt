Over the last few days I developed [Cycles.watch](https://cycles.watch) - a small dashboard to track and get notified about the cycles' consumption of my canister smart contracts.

I hope it can be useful to you too ðŸ¤—.

Just released a new version of that small dapp [Cycles.watch](https://cycles.watch) which now supports as well ... SNS projects.

Never too early to get ready for what's coming soon ðŸ¤ª
