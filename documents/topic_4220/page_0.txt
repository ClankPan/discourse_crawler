Hey,

I was searching for a grammar definition (bnf, antlr?) for Motoko language, and the best resource I found was [this](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko-grammar.html). 

I've searched @dfinity GitHub org and couldn't find the source code for Motoko. Is there a reason why it is closed source?

Will it be open-sourced in the future?

Thanks

I believe we are hoping to open source soon. 

There is indeed an OCaml Menhir grammar, from which that file you found is derived.

Out of curiosity, can I ask what you are planning to do with it?

It is a fun/hobby idea.. ;)

I was searching for an IntelliJ plugin for Motoko and couldn't find one. 

I've got some experience in parser/lexer stuff - thought I'd start creating an IntelliJ plugin for Motoko *(and maybe apply to [developer grant](https://dfinity.org/grants/)* if I make any progress :sweat_smile: ) Having some sort of a grammar file would come in handy for that ;)

I also wanna ask, are there any plans for an official IntelliJ plugin for Motoko in the future? (I am aware of the vscode extension)

I believe the VSCode plugin communicates with the language server, so it should be possible to use that with existing things for IntelliJ that support LSP.

[langserver.org](https://langserver.org) lists this:

Funny that u listed a repo from ballerina ;)

I used to work on ballerina-lang compiler team ;)

I will check it out..

@kritzcreek might be able to help with that.

Thanks for the reply @paulyoung 

Just wanna make sure one tiny thing before I  commit to this. 

I take it there isn't going to be an official intellij-plugin for motoko from the dfinity team?

-------------------------

As far as I know, we certainly don't have anything in the pipeline beyond more LSP support, if that helps.

-------------------------

ethdev1 | 2021-05-23 15:33:47 UTC | #9

it helps :slight_smile: 

Looking forward to see Mokoto be open-sourced. I will try and work with the grammar in the docs till then + checkout what @paulyoung suggested above. 

Thank you.

hey @ethdev1 please, lets us know if you make progress! I use JetBrains for development and would be great to use for Motoko too!

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-06-20 05:30:21 UTC | #11

The very thing I was wondering, I use it too.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-06-20 05:48:30 UTC | #12

Would someone mind giving me the short getting this going in JetBrains?

I suppose it shouldn't be a problem getting it working in PHP Storm?

... how functional is this compared to using the VS code plugin?

Thanks!
