Hi folks

Welcome to Week #2 of opening the IC roadmap

**Last Week**

- Besides the forum, we deployed the public roadmap: https://dfinity.org/roadmap/.
- People have been adding suggestions of new items for the roadmap on the [Megathread for community suggestions](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/megathread-community-submissions-for-dfinity-foundation-s-roadmap/6175/40)
- Threads like [Integrating with Bitcoin](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-bitcoin/6147/10), or [Increased Canister Storage](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increased-canister-storage/6148/21) have engaging conversations with the community, engineers, and researchers.

**What to expect this week**

* Look at [Increased Canister Storage project](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increased-canister-storage/6148/21) for an example of what future projects will look like, this is the project that is most ahead. This week will post a draft for the community to review and an NNS proposal for the community to vote on.
* We will start forking new threads from the Megathread this week!
* We are still staffing threads. Thank you for your patience.
