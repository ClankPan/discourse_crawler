Ah, the eternal dance around Tokenomics strikes again! It's like a never-ending game of cat and mouse.

Here we have Dom, the grand scientist, waxing poetic about why we should cut down on rewards. But hold up, where are the numbers? Stakeholders affected ? The charts? The SWAT analysis? Short and Long term consequences ? Implication on perceived instability from outsider ? Is this a serious debate or just a charades party?

As a fellow Game of Thrones enthusiast, all I can say is: SHAME! *ding ding*

Now, onto the discussion. It's like we're playing Candy Crush with our crypto decisions!

So, here's the master plan, simplified into three juicy steps:

1. Let's drop the act of pretending that we want a Neural Network System and neurons participating in votes. I mean, seriously, check out [Proposal: 55651 - ICP Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)  the ICP Dashboard is practically shouting it from the rooftops. Thanks, Manu, for the reality check!
2. Since these proof neuron votes are basically a comedy show meant to stroke participants' egos, why not just vote for the instant global "unstake" button and make them all liquid? Bye-bye, staking drama!
3. VoilÃ ! With no more stacking, there's no more inflation due to rewards. Cue the applause and happy dances all around!

And that, my friends, is how we turn a crypto conundrum into a comedy goldmine! ðŸŽ‰
