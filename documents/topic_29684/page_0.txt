Hello there,

I am excited to explore the possibilities of building on the Internet Computer and am seeking advice on creating a social media platform. While an Instagram clone is a popular project, I am interested in exploring other ideas within the social media space.

Mainly, I'm looking for guidance on architecture, scalability, and user experience. 

Are there specific features or functionalities that would align well with the Internet Computer's capabilities?

What are some best practices for ensuring a smooth user experience and robust performance?

Also, I would love to hear about any community projects or resources that could be beneficial for someone starting out in social media platform development on the Internet Computer.

Any guidance or assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thankyou in advance.

Glad to hear that you are looking into ICP.

You can check the [Internet Computer Ecosystem - SocialFi](https://internetcomputer.org/ecosystem?tag=SocialFi) section to discover social media platforms built on ICP. Many of the projects have open-sourced their code.

You can also use the [DFINITY Request for Startups](https://github.com/dfinity/grant-rfps/blob/main/requests-for-startups.md) for inspiration.

There is a plethora of information about developing on ICP on the [ICP docs site](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/overview-of-icp). If you are new to ICP, I would highly recommend the [ICP Developer Journey](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/). 

It would be helpful if you could provide an idea and a high-level architecture. However, SocialFi platforms on ICP take advantage of the following:

- Utilize [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity) to allow users to sign in using a passkey (ex. FaceID, TouchID, or passcodes)
- Reverse gas fee model (The app pays for the user's gas fees)
- [ckBTC](https://internetcomputer.org/ckbtc) and [ckETH](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cketh-a-canister-issued-ether-twin-token-on-the-ic/22819) as rewards. Lower gas and faster transactions than the Bitcoin and Ethereum token equivalents
- [Threshold ECDSA](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works) to create wallet addresses and signatures for Bitcoin and Ethereum within an ICP canister smart contract (enable multi-chain experiences)
- On-chain storage and computation

And much more!

The most promising web3-based social media platforms take advantage of how web3 can provide interesting and unique experiences to users.
