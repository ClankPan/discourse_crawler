Hi Everyone,

Sorry I'm sure this has been asked before but is just that I'm pretty sure that I have read it somewhere that sometime in the project phase of ckBTC\ckETH it will soon have a native naming like BTC\ETH which will make it look more cool. I can't find the article that I have read wherein it explain the phases of the ck project. Can anyone share the link please?

I have read the Chain fusion roadmap, my understanding on this is that we will have BTC/ETH someday which eliminates ck___ on the naming convention :slight_smile:. I know it will just be the aesthetics and will still be a twin but I would love to see that for it will feel more seamless that everything is running on one chain. Or am I wrong and it will not happen? ck_____ is here to stay forever which I can understand :slight_smile:

I'm not sure what article you are referring to. If you can find the link, please post it here!

I see the appeal of just calling it, for example, "bitcoin on the IC" using the BTC symbol. However, there is also a risk of confusion because funds are associated with principal IDs (and subaccounts), which look very different from Bitcoin addresses. Moreover, transfers cannot be found on Bitcoin blockchain explorers...
In short, it is unlikely that the `ck` prefix will be dropped, at least there are no plans to do so.

Thanks for the reply, perhaps it is just my wishful thinking coz I'm trying to find the article for several days now hahahaha. You will guys know better than anyone what is the best. So I'll just have to get used to it.
