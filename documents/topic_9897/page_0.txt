So the core outline of the solution (in user land) including the motivation is in the following repository 
https://github.com/icdev2dev/sachvo

Happy to report that the codification of solution works !

Over the next couple of days, I will fill out the details of the solution.

Happy Holidays (if you observe)

This is wonderful. The introduction is so exact. A marvel of truth.

So I guess it would work for neurons created thanks to Ledger hardwallet by setting this kind of followee too !

The POC is now documented in github including a video on how to create a manage neuron followee. Unfortunately it does not seem likely that one would be able to assign a followee currently to a ledger managed neuron.

@Icdev2dev 
In the video you show that the request parameter topic 1 is manage neuron.  How do you know these parameters and which topic is which number?  Where did you go to learn that information?

Iâ€™m having trouble finding information about the manage neuron features that are available for a neuron and would like to learn more about the various options.

Thanks!

The original idea about the topic 1 being the manage neuron topic came from https://icdevs.org/ under the Dedicate Neuron. The "how to set the parameters" came from https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/issues/261. Just a quick plug : I would also like that issue to be resolved (clear description and separate section for manage neuron topic). I believe that this is what you are asking for as well.

As to **which topic is which number**, I have not mapped all the topics. I suppose one way of doing this is through the video that is linked by going through all topics and noting their numbers. So far, I know
 
    0 -- All Topics
    1 -- Manage Neuron
    2 -- Exchange Rate 

I found about the different options in manage-neuron topic through quill. *quill-linux-x86_64 neuron-manage --help*, Specifically it exposes the following options:

- add-hot-key
- disburse
- join-community-fund
- merge-maturity
- remove-hot-key
- spawn
- split 
- start-dissolving
- stop-dissolving

Auto merging is now operational. The code is checked in into the repo linked above. The outline of the details is a little rough. Please let me know if you use this solution and if you have any issues.

As an aside, it does cost 0.02 ICP per management proposal. Since I have 5 neurons to manage, it does add up. So it is cost effective for me to do weekly auto-merges but not daily.
