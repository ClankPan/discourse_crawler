I believe cloud PCs like Windows 365 will be important in the future. Can Computer-as-a-Service be serviced on the Internet Computer?

I enter NNS every day to vote and merge maturity. And the site reacts too slowly.  (Maybe it's because I'm staying in Asia.)

If, after a few years later, there are enough nodes deployed around the world, I think the current website hosting will run smoothly enough. But will services, such as Windows 365, Xbox cloud gaming, Stadia, etc., be available? Are there any fundamental technical limitations in sufficiently reducing latency due to the unique structures of ICP?
