@Artemi5 = @Apollon = @Ivan = @ivan_uncensored = @cat2 = @boomerfinity
Are you going to make a point or just post screen captures of examples where you and your other current identity @Apollon have violated forum rule and had you posts moderated?  If you remain civilized and diplomatic you can post anything you want.

To the community:
THE FORUM IS A CIVILIZED PLACE FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION.  Censorship is not the same as moderation.  This forum has rules and the rules are enforced reasonably on this site.  There are many places without rules where people can go to cut loose and say anything they want about anything they want because there is no moderation.  The forum is not one of them.

I do not work for DFINITY.  I have not been asked to come to the forum to contribute in any way.  Yet I do because this has historically been the best place for truly intellectually honest conversation about topics that are notable for NNS governance.  I would like for the forum to remain civilized while continuing to allow the intellectually honest conversation that has been a cornerstone of this forum community.

The moderators can only do so much.  The community has an important role to help keep the forum civilized.  You do not have to respond to specific comments to help with this effort.  All you have to do is flag the post and let the moderators take care of the rest.  If you spend any time on the forum, you will find that what gets moderated is the content that the vast majority of reasonable people would agree is in violation of the forum rules and needs to be moderated.

Flagging a post is accomplished by clicking the three dots below the post and then clicking the flag icon.  This will pop up a window that enables you to select why it is being flagged: e.g. off topic, inappropriate, spam, something else.

In case you would like to know the forum rules and expectations, here is a link…
https://forum.dfinity.org/faq

Also, here are the screen captures of that page to help make sure these rules are clearly evident within this thread....

we read the rules wenzel, as we said if you have anything credible to contribute you can, otherwise stop derailing this thread with personal attacks which the moderators are ignoring.


Apollon will be back again, because they never really left.


Note that wenzel has been accusing Apollon Research, Me, Cat, Accumulating.icp and few others of being bad actors and same individuals

-------------------------

Artemi5 | 2023-10-31 10:57:21 UTC | #9

We are still digging through the forums for more evidence of censorship and abusing moderator privileges.

we are also looking for and counting the number of unresolved issues, unresolved flags and suppressed content.

We will publish detailed information and also submit it on the NNS with proposals.

I hold Wenzel in high regard as a valuable forum contributor, whereas the seemingly identical profiles of Cat and @Accumulating.icp raise suspicions

Artemi5 | 2023-10-31 11:37:46 UTC | #13

We honestly don't know how Cat and Accumulating got dragged into BOOM DAO discussions there.

[/quote]

To be crystal clear, I did not accuse @Accumulating.icp of being a bad actor or the same individual as the others listed.  I asked a simple question if he is controlling the @Apollon identity on the forum.  @Apollon immediately twisted the narrative.  @Accumulating.icp provided an answer, which I accept in good faith.  The fact that his name keeps coming up in association with this group is completely the fault of the people who keep bringing it up.

[quote="wpb, post:129, topic:24025, full:true"]
Hey @Accumulating.icp are you involved with @Apollon research? More directly, are you controlling the @Apollon identity on the forum?
[/quote]

[quote="wpb, post:131, topic:24025, full:true"]
I asked a pretty direct question and would appreciate a full and honest answer instead of a deflection.

Thanks for answering my question @Accumulating.icp.

[quote="wpb, post:149, topic:24025"]
I take your word for it. I asked a simple question and you provided an answer, which I appreciate. If fine with leaving it there. If it blows into something more then it will be because @Apollon or you press the issue further.

Just in case the title of this post gets changed, here is the original title.  It's a good title because it draws people in.  I am in support of people seeing this thread if they are interested and I would not want it to be buried by changing the title if it doesn't go the way the OP intended.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:151, topic:24025"]
Again, I strongly encourage anyone reading this to delve into the history of my forum account, as these claims are a repetitive attempt to discredit character.

[quote="wpb, post:149, topic:24025"]
It was also noticeable that you were not engaged in the discussion while @apollon has been engaged.
[/quote]

In regards to this “reasoning” - I honestly think it has to be the weakest yet. Due to the fact that I’m not engaging in a petty argument, that means I have made a new account to do so in disguise…?

Have you ever considered that people are busy, are building

[quote="Apollon, post:130, topic:24025"]
We have already answered your question which you seem to flag and ignore. When will your friends start answering wenzel?

No wenzel, this account is not yet being controlled by multiple parties.

we would love to have @Accumulating.icp on our team and we publicly extend this invitation to him. Sorry for the tags @Accumulating.icp , we just can’t seem to overcome the hypocrisy in the forums.

We will obviously mention from now who is typing these messages. For now its just Apollon.

@ - Apollon
[/quote]

[quote="Apollon, post:120, topic:24025"]
We already posted this. We linked the tweet as well.

You seem to be flagging posts left and right to cover your facade with multiple off topic irrelevant posts

[quote="wpb, post:114, topic:24025"]
This is the sad reality of Apollon Research and their army.
[/quote]

We have no “ARMY”, we have no affiliation with either. Clearly you won’t stop tagging us.

We will soon release the website and you can learn more. Also seems like few others are realizing the forum’s corruption here.

Any moderators available that can remove these off topic posts?? You make wild baseless claims here and ask for proofs right when we talk about the treasury drain. What are your intentions really?

**lets keep the discussion on BOOM DAO’s red flags and how they drained the treasury**. Leave us your replies and We will get back to you with responses. We already spent enough time here going in circles.

Someone is actively censoring the discussion @Sormarler, we have no more interest in this. Good luck.

Artemi5 | 2023-10-31 11:58:52 UTC | #17

From your messages the BOOM DAO's discussions have been derailed and led to it getting locked while Apollon repeatedly asked you not to

-------------------------

Artemi5 | 2023-10-31 12:03:34 UTC | #18

Stop spamming this thread Wenzel. Create a separate thread if you have questions about Apollon like he politely asked you to

infu | 2023-10-31 12:15:40 UTC | #20

Perhaps we should add more categories and not just have one 'Governance' but split it into more and make sure posts stay in their designated category.
A few names that come to mind: Governance informal / Debate Arena / Governance Lounge
And also something like: important governance news / updates

Honestly, I perceive you as producing much more spam around here, like repeatedly posting follow-ups to your own posts. I also perceive your tone as very aggressive — which presumably is the reason for receiving flags (and no, I haven't flagged anything so far).

While moderation is bound to be somewhat subjective, it would go a long way to at least try to understand the difference between moderation and censorship: one is about preserving a civilised discussion, while the other is about suppressing opinions regardless of form. I for one think that moderators, if anything, have rather been too lenient on recent threads – nobody would accept some of the displayed behaviours in real world interaction.

Accumulating.icp | 2023-10-31 13:03:40 UTC | #25

I’m curious why you don’t go after @Caesar for framing a narrative, @wpb , as you do to so many others?

There is clearly no correlation, connection, or resemblance, between the content I, and any of these accounts post - which is easily verified by anybody willing to look past blanket statement & explore the contents of forums accounts themselves.

However, whoever is controlling Caesar (@wpb is it you? Just asking since you made the assumption I am Apollon based off behaviour - I figure I’ll reapply the logic), obviously is banking on lack of due diligence on these personal attacks against me from a readers perspective so that they can fit the narrative to their needs. 

I also find it curious that our righteous moderators, @diegop & @Ang haven’t followed up on these personal attacks, as they have on behalf of you, and so many others, countless times in the past!

There's only one person strawmanning here. Neither am I still a Dfinity employee, nor did I ever have a clause like that in my contract or received an instruction to that end in any form. That's entirely your conspiracy theory.

are you sure? we have proof. You can talk to @ricky @dominicwilliams and confirm it. If anyone wants proof they can DM us.


DFINITYs internal incentive system is based off on tribalism and self promotion. We also know about DFINITY's paid influencer programs ala marketing / **special projects.**

DFINITY doesn't disclose everything. They can however leverage plausible deniability. Legal discovery of the slack and signal (if possible) messages on this would be a gold mine tho.
