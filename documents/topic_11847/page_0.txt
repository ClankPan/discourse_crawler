Dear ICP Community,

**TLDR:** DFINITY Foundation will vote NO on a proposal: 

* [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52564](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52564)

## Background

The DFINITY Foundation (via its named neuron 27) has started to [vote on governance proposals.](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-approach-to-voting-on-governance-proposals/11845) Since the DFINITY Foundation is a critical player in the ecosystem, our long-term intent is to make a habit of explaining our rationale for how we vote in motion proposals, Foundation voting power, etc... for further visibility.

## Proposal in question

In this particular case, we will vote NO on Proposal:

* [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52564](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52564)

## We want to be clear in what this means and does not mean:

1. Foundation's default voting for voting is to REJECT any proposal it does not fully understand and agree with. The foundation is rejecting because it believes motion proposals are supposed to:
  * Inspire direction or conversations to bring the IC forward
  * be actionable (they have a goal)

In this particular case, the foundation found a Chinese translation of an IC [wiki page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Create_an_NNS_motion_proposal) to not satisfy either of those goals.

2. Foundation may yet vote YES on future proposals from this neuron if proposals inspire direction or conversations to bring the IC forward.

The Foundation should refrain from voting in that case no?

It should not refrain, bad proposals can slide through
