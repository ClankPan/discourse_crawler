Greetings,

I recently was looking at dfinity and watched some lectures by Jan:

After taking some notes and looking at the whitepaper I scraped a few screenshots from the equations and threw some of the concepts into some abstract visualizations.

I'm pretty much done with this mini-project in learning about Dfinity for now, but if anyone wants to throw these suckers behind a technical slide presentation or blog post / video , feel free to copy/paste in!

GoogleDrive Folder containing image stills of each variation on the Dfinity Logo:

GoogleDrive Folder containing "**PerfectLoop**" ~30s videos (great to transform into GIF via ffmpeg etc..):

Super neat üëç. Happy to use one if I ever write a blog post on motoko or tooling again, thx.

If I or anyone would do so, what credits would you like us to share?

Like "Abstract visualuzations from cstr + link"
