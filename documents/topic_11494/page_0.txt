We know web 2.0 is not going away anytime soon. Is it possible to make Internet Identity usable with Web 2.0?

For example - like login with Facebook - Login with internet identity?

Yes! The Internet Identity was explicitly designed to allow that, and one just has to implement the [client auth protocol](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/internet-identity-spec.adoc#client-auth-protocol). For that, the existing Javascript libraries probably only need mild adjustments, and a little bit of signature checking code on the (conventional) server.

Are you just asking out of curiosity, or do you have concrete plans? Iâ€™m happy to advise.

Hey thanks for your answer. This was just out of curiosity and an idea - seems to me like a very good use case for the Internet Identity.

Can bring more people from the web2 world to the IC. Like a billboard about IC everywhere.
