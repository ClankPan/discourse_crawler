A question concerning several of the current Subnet Management proposals, which I have been reviewing as part of the CodeGov team. These mention that Data Centre mu1 (q.beyond in Munich) is to be decommissioned. Is there any further information that can be provided about the decommissioning, as so far I havenâ€™t been able to find anything further within the Forum or elsewhere online?

Thanks.
