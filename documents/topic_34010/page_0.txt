Hi everyone,

We're working on a payment protocol on the Internet Computer and could use some assistance with generating multiple payment addresses under a single canister using Motoko.

Specifically, we need the canister to generate a new payment address (Principal ID) on demand. Each time a new payment is required, a unique address should be created.

Any guidance on how to achieve this or suggestions for best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
