As a newbie to ICP and after doing many hours of research by myself I have become very interested in this project and would like to know all I can.

I would like to meetup with people local to my area that have the same interest and share the knowledge.

I live in Australia, NSW, The Central Coast.

I would be very interested in anyone who would like to meetup on a regular basis
