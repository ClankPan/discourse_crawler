Hi devs, I have a question about Motoko indentation.

"dfx new" cmd generates the default greet Motoko codes with 4 spaces indentation.
But, [the Motoko style guideline](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/language-guide/style.html) recommends 2 spaces.

What do you think about this diff?

I agree with the rationale written in the Motoko style guideline because nested switch-case expression is often used in Motoko codes.
>  "Rationale: There may be a lot of nesting. Using only 2 spaces avoids wasting screen estate."

So IMO, "dfx new" should also generate the default codes with 2 spaces indentation to avoid confusion.

Thanks.
