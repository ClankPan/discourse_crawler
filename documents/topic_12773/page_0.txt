I have tried the solution in:

[https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-replica-returned-an-error-code-4-message-caller-is-not-authorized/7568](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/post-bootcamp-study-thread-for-us-real-beginners-jump-on-in/11497)

It didn't work.

It's the error info:
Error: The --mode=reinstall is only valid when specifying a single canister, because reinstallation destroys all data in the canister.

What is the command line if I have more than one canister?
