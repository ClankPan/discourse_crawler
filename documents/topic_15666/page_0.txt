Hi all, I want to call the backend canister function using actor in my react application. I have created the actor and it goes like this when console logged

But when I use that actor to call the function, it shows me an error like this..

Have I done anything wrong out here! What's the issue?

Note: Important thing I note in the error log is the msg part, 
```
"Message": "IC0302: Canister rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai has no query method 'allPosts'"
```
Here the canister ID is not the backend canister ID, but the frontend canister ID.

Since you say the error message displays the wrong canister ID: Can you show how you create the actor?

Other, completely wild guess: the error message says there is no **query** method `allPosts`. Is it by chance not marked as a query so you'd have to call it as an update call?

Hi Severin, Thanks for the reply.. It is a minor mistake. My code imported the frontend canisterId rather than the backend. :sweat_smile:
