I was creating canister using nns wallet, got my ICP deducted but at the same moment my brave browser got crashed. After refreshing the browser, no new canister got created or added in the nns.

Is there any way to recover the newly created canister? Because I can see txs in my nns wallet for ICP deduction and I can also see txs for transfer and burn, but I am not able to find out newly created canister id.

go to https://icscan.io/, search with your principal id from nns, you will see the canister list if it was created

I knew that, but problem is I have created 100s of canisters so its impossible to get the canister from that list.
