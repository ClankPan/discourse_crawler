Hi!
Could someone help, when I call an extern canister from a canister it takes more than 3 seconds, and when I call the canister directly it takes almost no time?

Hi, If you just want simple query call take a look at [Composite queries](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/composite-query).

No it is not the call it self the problem, the issue is that 
I have a deployed gateway_canister_1 from a project_1 which calls a function in another backend_canister outside the project_1 
when I call a query function directly on backend_canister it takes no time, but if I call the same function but via  gateway_canister_1  it takes more then 3 seconds, as I suspect the delay is because of they are in two different sub_nets, is there any way to optimize?

Going cross-subnet usually costs at least 4 blocks (~4 seconds). The only way to optimize that away is to create your canister on the same subnet. `dfx canister create`, `dfx ledger create-canister`, and `dfx deploy` now support the `--next-to` flag so you can ask it to put the canisters next to the other project
