1. What is the purpose of ICP on Ledger if I still must create an NNS identity? 
2. What happens if you lose control of your NNS identity with a Ledger attached?

-------------------------

timo | 2021-12-17 08:15:17 UTC | #2

The NNS dapp is merely a frontend and the identity anchor you use to log in into this frontend is meaningless for the purpose of controlling ICP that are on the Ledger. The login is only there because the NNS dapp happens to provide other features that actually use the identity.

Nothing happens to the ICP that are on the Ledger if you lose control of that identity. You can just log in with a different identity, connect the hardware wallet and the coins are there. Conversely, if someone else gains control of the identity then without the Ledger they cannot control your coins that are on the Ledger.

Thank you @timo 
@diegop Would you be so kind and confirm this? üôè

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-12-20 16:08:18 UTC | #4

Confirmed.

Timo is the expert (and Principal Researcher at Dfinity), so i Can confirm that Timo is among the canonical sources for this.

Also, the NNS app can be replaced for Ledger hard wallet management at any time, if anyone wants to build a replacement. We have an NPM package available for talking to the interface, and anyone could go out and build a simple, dedicated UI for managing your balance and neurons, if they wanted to

This package has been public for a long time, but I just haven't advertised it, since the ledger app wasn't official yet

@timo Do you think we will be able to move our Neurons to Ledgers later?

-------------------------

timo | 2021-12-21 08:28:16 UTC | #8

You mean neurons that were created from liquid ICP by using the NNS dapp with an internet identity (not linked to a hardware wallet)? No, those you cannot move to a Ledger because neurons cannot be "moved" at all. That is because a neuron's controller cannot be changed.

-------------------------

cuddlesquid | 2021-12-21 09:22:09 UTC | #9

I thought this would be the case :sob:
Will just have to protect original NNS Anchor well.
Thanks @timo üôè

I have some additional questions if you dont mind:

1) Is the ledger needed to perform actions on the NNS (community fund, neuron management, etc...)? If the II is compromised are my neurons safe?

2) If I lose access to both my II and ledger, is the ledger seed phrase enough to recover the lost tokens and neurons? (obviously assuming I buy a new ledger and import the seed phrase from the old one) 

3) Same scenario as 2 but instead of recovering the tokens I want to recover the II that was associated to the ledger using the FiDo app.

A previous answer from me should answer this: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/help-me-understand-icp-on-nano-ledger/9747/2?u=timo

In short: yes. (Assuming you connect the Ledger as a "hardware wallet", not as a Fido key)

Yes, Ledger is needed for those actions. You can define a hotkey but that's only for voting, not neuron management.

Actually, in this scenario, I think it is also true. My understanding of the Fido app on Ledger is that the key is derived deterministically from the seed phrase. If my understanding is correct then you can recover your II from just the seed phrase. But don't forget that you also need to know your II anchor number!

In a worst case scenario that you could be brute forceable, but it's certainly highly inconvenient if you forget it.

In that case would you say its safe to add the II where I have my neurons on my phone if the neurons are attached to a ledger? It would make voting everyday easier.

Can a HotKey be created to compuned interest? Or does that require a ledger?

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-12-24 11:58:55 UTC | #16

Yes, this is totally true ! So it is true for the 2. if your II is authenticated through FIDO.

I was able to recover from Nano S to Nano X using the seed phrase only in a disaster recovery simulation.

Hi I've tested this out and have an issue.

I‚Äôm staking on my Ledger and just bought a 2nd Ledger to keep as a backup. I just setup my backup Ledger with seed phrase and added ICP app. Issue is that it NNS doesn‚Äôt see it as the same Ledger. If I try and make a change to a neuron using this backup Ledger, I get this error:

**Exception: The hardware wallet‚Äôs principal doesn‚Äôt match the account‚Äôs principal. Are you sure you connected the right wallet?**

All I‚Äôm doing is exactly what I‚Äôd do if I lost my main Ledger. Any ideas?

Thanks
Sam

wiped and added seed again and all good.

Hey Guys Hello Everyone ( This is kinda a dual topic with ledger and changing of my phone so sorry in advance)
So im having an issue login into my account , and starting to freak out i may have lost it.
About a month ago i changed my phone

Now i did a hard transfer from phone to phone, and I swear i was able to connect my new phone to my existing account, but lets say this never happened.( Part about accessing existing account in new phone)

I still have my existing identity number 

When Logging in from my new phone, which is an android, I set up a Samsung pass because i wanted a fingerprint entry to my phone, and thought this would work with my ICP as well.

when logging in, i get the 2 following errors ( i also tried setting up using the existing identity with new device, reason for both Reponses from my phone)
( no passkey available)
((Device couldn't connect)

Now when previously accessed i had this linked with my ledger account, not sure if it can be accessed this way, but all of my tokens were being staked and i really hope this isn't an issue due to the staking.

I always accessed this via my laptop but had to use my phone as the Passkey ( i believe this is the terminology) Via Brave Browser
I also never never set up a 24 word phrase because i never knew this was an option or saw this option.

Sorry for log paragraph just need help accessing as of course, ICP explodes when i cannot access.
Also let me know if this was in another Forum
ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED

Hi! 
I reset the ledger several times but I get the same error:Wallet account identifier doesn‚Äôt match.Are you sure you connected the right hardware wallet?...
Any idea???

Is your ICP app from the ledger app store using the latest version? Can you please send a support ticket to support@dfinity.org
