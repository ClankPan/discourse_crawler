Considering that many users who used twitter were hacked and still in the process of being hacked, many tokens and NFTs were stolen. Yesterday Plugwallet twitter also hacked, so I think we should not put to much ICP and NFTs in the no-ii wallet. 

I am here asking the nns team, if it is possible for the NNS to support NFTs in the future so that we could send NFTs to the NNS to be safe?

You can try to contact the nns team to help you, there must be some ways to get it out I believe.
