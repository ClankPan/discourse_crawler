When launching a frontend (e.g. in the [custom_greeting tutorial](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/custom-frontend.html)) with the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=` url, the console reports 

```
DevTools failed to load SourceMap: Could not load content for http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.js.map: HTTP error: status code 404, net::ERR_HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE_FAILURE
```

How can I get my SourceMap to load? Not sure how it would ever successfully load the SourceMap at that url; how would it know which canister's SourceMap to load?

As in the tutorial, I have `devtool: "source-map"` specified in webpack.config.js.

edit: this seems like a question for StackOverflow. Are we encouraged to ask this kind of question here or there?
