Some cursory investigations:

On May 13th, 2024, at 11:37, the Internet Identity went down, along with its entire subnet:

**Subnet**

Id: [uzr34-akd3s-xrdag-3ql62-ocgoh-ld2ao-tamcv-54e7j-krwgb-2gm4z-oqe](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/uzr34-akd3s-xrdag-3ql62-ocgoh-ld2ao-tamcv-54e7j-krwgb-2gm4z-oqe?nd-s=100)

The subnet contains 5 canisters. At the time of the outage, they collectively hold 10.8 GiB of state information and the block height is 44,958,403.

How does ICP update a canister that's causing an error with internet identity through NNS governance voting, if the error prevents voters from accessing their NNS accounts to cast their votes?

-------------------------

willguest | 2024-05-13 13:47:06 UTC | #8

Neither of the two shown above (NNS identity and XRC) show any updates made during May, so I am assuming the error relates to one of the others.

So the options are Cycles Ledger, Cycles Index, or "unnamed", which is my best guess for the source, either because it isn't meant to be unnamed, or because it is.

Most of the big, original neurons are actually mainly controlled by CLI tools like [quill](https://github.com/dfinity/quill). And even if your neuron is held by your NNS dapp principal, you can still add a quill-controlled identity as a hotkey so you can vote from the console as well. The third avenue is by following a CLI-controlled neuron

It was actually the subnet, not a specific canister. There's also info over here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-05-09-23-02/30606/6

Agnostic | 2024-05-15 13:28:02 UTC | #10

For what it's worth, I was able to login into the NNS around the time this error was reported.  So whatever this problem was, it did not affect the entire ICP system.

I get an Internal Server Error when visiting any NNS page at the moment

There's nothing to worry about.  I'm sure Dfinity is on top of the issue whatever it may be.  Just check back later or tomorrow.  They'll fix it.
