Hello everyone! I am curious to know if is there a way for a centralized application with the back-end written with nodejs or java to make calls to a canister. Is it possible? 

Thank you.

Have you looked at the Dfinity Agent lib? Its technically for the frontend, but I wonder if you could still us it on the BE.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/agent

For Java, check this out

I know its Kotlin, but its interoperable!

I was wondering about using the @dfinity/agent with a node backend as well. would be great to have some documentation around it.
