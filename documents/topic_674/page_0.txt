Happy Friday, community!

We are excited to announce that the `candid` repo has been open sourced as of today on our DFINITY organization GitHub! :tada: 

Candid is an interface description language (IDL) for interacting with *canisters* (also known as *services* or *actors*) running on the Internet Computer.

This repository hosts the following crates:

* `candid` , a serialization/deserialization library for Candid. You can seamlessly convert between Rust values and Candid in both binary and text format.
* `candid_derive` , an internal crate to convert Rust data types to Candid types. This crate should be considered as an implementation detail, and not be used directly, only via the  `candid`  crate.

Get started here: https://github.com/dfinity/candid

Cheers!
