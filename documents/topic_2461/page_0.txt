Hi,
when I try to deploy to https://gw.dfinity.network/ I get this error :frowning: :
```
The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister apx37-tyaaa-aaaab-qaloq-cai trapped explicitly: An error happened during the call: 1: Canister g62zx-eyaaa-aaaab-qa7pq-cai with memory allocation 10MiB cannot be installed because the Subnet's remaining memory capacity is 5MiB"
```

I got a presentation tomorrow :frowning: is there another testnet ?

Maybe you should try dfx 0.7.0 as described here: [Announcing Improved Asset Canisters](https://www.notion.so/Announcing-Improved-Asset-Canisters-7b5815f6ca46461dae4b7f22501f4e39).

I get the same issue deploying to the IC, have tried setting --memory-allocation but it still fails with "memory allocation 3MiB cannot be installed because the Subnet's remaining memory capacity is 0MiB"

Hello.
How to "specifying" --memory-allocation= please ?

Itâ€™s an argument on the dfx canister install command, docs for this can be found here: [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference/dfx-canister.html#_dfx_canister_install](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference/dfx-canister.html#_dfx_canister_install)
