I'm trying to get a custom domain working, and I run into an issue when I try to register the domain with the curl POST request. I get this error message:

```
missing dns cname record from _acme-challenge.mydomain.com. to _acme-challenge.mydomain.com.icp2.io.
```
I have followed the example in the documentation, and I believe everything should be setup correctly. The only thing I have noticed is, that the error message adds a "." at the end of `_acme-challenge.mydomain.com.` which my DNS won't allow me to do. 

I use Namecheap for my domain/DNS if that makes a difference.

Hey @Carsten, 

If you share your domain with me (also via DM), I can check what is going on.

Otherwise, you can simply run this command and replace `$CUSTOM_DOMAIN` with your domain:
```
dig CNAME _acme-challenge.$CUSTOM_DOMAIN +short
```
And the output should look like:
```
_acme-challenge.$CUSTOM_DOMAIN.icp2.io.
```
If that is not the case, then, you need to change your DNS configuration.

Hey @rbirkner,

I'm not getting a response from the dig command, so I guess the issue is with my DNS.

The two domains I'm trying to setup are carstenjacobsen.com and blockchainsanddreams.com

@rbirkner,

I figured out what the issue was. My DNS service was automatically adding the domain name to the CNAME records, so when I used `_acme-challenge.$CUSTOM_DOMAIN` then it was actually stored as `_acme-challenge.$CUSTOM_DOMAIN.$CUSTOM_DOMAIN`.

Using the `dig` command really helped me debug, so thanks for the advise!

Unfortunately, I am getting the same issue. When I try adding the CNAME record, this is the error I am getting
![image|690x61](upload://t5ftLAy0lNHrOPwFXLXnEASmzr1.png)

When I try running the command ```dig CNAME _acme-challenge.icphubkenya.io +short``` from my terminal I am not getting any response. 

How do I solve this?

Hey @Stephen-Kimoi 

Unfortunately, I can't help you with that. It looks like there is something wrong in your DNS configuration or your registrar has some bug. This is something to take up with them.

Thanks for your quick response. I was able to sort the error. It seems I had inserted the TXT record before the CNAME record, which was bringing the error.

Same issue here with namecheap.com, I've tried everything but `dig CNAME _acme-challenge.MY_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_HERE_DOT_COM +short` always gives an empty answer

Is there some delay between you update the records and they are visible via dig?
if I remove `+short` I see the correct value in the output

Hey @let4be 

Can you please be more specific and I can help you register your custom domain.

um, I think it was the caching. because after waiting for a while and invoking registration again, it just passes without the errors.
namecheap takes a while to propogate CNAME records

Glad to hear that it worked out in the end!
