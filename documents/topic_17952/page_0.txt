It's been few weeks since I did not faced it but, it is not the first time I run `dfx start` and my local replica goes banana in an endless loop.

etc.
etc.
etc.

When this happen got no other choice than killing processes and start from scratch (`dfx start --clean`) and redeploy everything (🥲) because my local state is broken.

Might good be it is something wrong on my side but, just in case, did anyone faced such issue too?
Did you figured out what lead to such an incorrect state?

I think I finally figured out, I got this issue when I actually start `dfx start` at the root of my mono-repo in which there is no `.dfx`

```
root/ <---- if I start incorrectly here, I get that infinite loop error 
root/admin/ <---- if I start correctly here, all good
root/admin/.dfx
```
