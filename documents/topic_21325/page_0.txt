I've been using Plug for my apps for quite some time now without any issues. However, now I noticed that the connection does not persist anymore when refreshing the page. This doesn't seem to be an error on my side because the behavior is identical on other popular dapps like Toniq and Yumi: When refreshing the page, the connection is lost and Plug asks me to connect again. I also reinstalled Plug on Chromium and tested it on Firefox (both on Linux) but the issue persists.

I've asked in the Plug discord, but haven't gotten an explanation yet. Has anybody else noticed this?

Something is off with Plug's latest update.

Same issue here.

Disconnect does not work either.

Yeah, meanwhile someone else on their discord confirmed it. Good to know it's not just me!
