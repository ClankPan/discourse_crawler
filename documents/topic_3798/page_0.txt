Guys the telegram channel is out of control. You should appoint some active admins (could be community members) and get rid of all the price speculations. Would give a more serious image for new investors. 

Just a suggestion :)

The main group is certainly a torrent of discussion; everyone is working hard to help out in there with the community’s questions! If you’d prefer a slower pace with a technical focus there is a telegram developer group instead, you’d be very welcome: [https://t.me/DFINITY_Devs](https://t.me/DFINITY_Devs)

Thanks, will check out that one. I don't mind the speculations and the torrent of discussion. I just think price discussions could be moved to a community channel that is not directly associated with Dfinity. But thats just my preferances and maybe Dfinity like it the way it is.

The price talk would be better in other channels I agree, it’s great to see staking and governance participation questions coming through though—and everyone helping each other out with these too.
