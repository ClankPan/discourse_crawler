Hi now that DeFi is starting to take over on ICP, is it possible for early adopters that are working already on DIP20 or others to upgrade to the future standard of ICP ICRC-1? Or it would involve a fork as in other chains?

The interfaces can be compatible with one another. They provide the same exact functionality
