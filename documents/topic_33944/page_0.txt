To create a SNS proposal, an URL is required. 

```
type Proposal = record {
  url : text;
  title : text;
  action : opt Action;
  summary : text;
};
```

While I understand that for motion proposal, the URL must point to the forum, I'm confused about what value should be provided to create a `TransferSnsTreasuryFunds`.

According [documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals/#transfersnstreasuryfunds), the URL seems to have to be provided as `https://sns-examples.com/proposal/42`.

```
quill sns make-proposal <PROPOSER_NEURON_ID> --proposal '(
    record {
        title = "Transfer 41100 ICP to Foo Labs";
        url = "https://sns-examples.com/proposal/42";
        summary = "Transfer 411 ICP to Foo Labs";
        action = opt variant {
            TransferSnsTreasuryFunds = record {

                from_treasury = 1 : int32;

                to_principal = opt principal "ozcnp-xcxhg-inakz-sg3bi-nczm3-jhg6y-idt46-cdygl-ebztx-iq4ft-vae";

                to_subaccount = null;

                memo = null;

                amount_e8s = 4_110_000_000_000 : nat64;
            };
        };
    };
)' > message.json
```
 
So, what's `sns-examples.com` IRL or what are the rule that apply?
