Hi everyone! This is the roadmap update for November.

![Screenshot 2022-11-11 at 10.15.56|690x178](upload://bCIjzrExZD36x7aphU10CNyIC3e.png)

Since [the last update](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-roadmap-update-october-2022/15756), we completed [the subnet migration](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-subnet-migration-on-october-26/15989/16).

This month we are planning to:
* finally deploy the archive
* further improve the auth screen and make it easier to handle multiple anchors
* continue working on improving the UX overall
* start working on the domain migration which, in the first part, will focus on II internals and reorganizing canister storage

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
