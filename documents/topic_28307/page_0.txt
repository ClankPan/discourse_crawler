In this forum, the concept of neuron transfer has been discussed extensively, and I fully understand the associated risks. My proposal is to introduce a more constrained functionality, specifically the ability to consolidate accounts, akin to merging neurons. For instance, if I purchase an internet ID on idgeek that contains 100 ICP with an 8-year staking period, I currently need to manage this ID independently. What if there were a way to amalgamate this entire account with my existing one, eliminating the need to juggle multiple IDs?

Great Idea. 
When I did my research on idgeek, managing neurons in multiple IIDs is an inconvenience if not risky.
