The market has been falling, I wonder if the DFINITY official team has a solution, if it is FUD, someone took the opportunity to short, then please squeeze the short and eliminate the panic!

If someone is not short, please give your opinion to eliminate everyone's panic, do not be an irresponsible leader, at least when the buzz, the DFINITY team did not make a sound

I’ve created a thread in which a solution is spelled out, and the parameters of the solution are up for discussion. You’ll find it [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/solution-for-preventing-node-provider-rewards-inflationary-death-spiral/23045?u=jesse)

I think at this time, we should protect the price of ICP and keep it tied to FIL, rather than allow this incident to continue to expand, and DFINITY still does nothing at this time
