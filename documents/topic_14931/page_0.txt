Lately, I have been noticing some serious toxicity inside the IC community. I am calling on all higher-level devs. and members of the foundation to address this issue immediately. There have been several occasions in meetings and on certain discussion topics that individuals bully, or blatantly ignore certain users (normally the "victims" being new users trying to learn/ wrap their heads around new concepts, or like me just learning for a hobby). It is obvious, to even new users, the divide that is sweeping the IC. This has, in turn, created a toxic work culture that needs to be immediately addressed (as if it was a dire issue to the protocol itself). I'll admit I am not as tech savvy as some of the devs. on the IC. So, my assistance on governance or the protocol itself is limited to the archetype of a student... However, there is more to a community than its product. The community is a living organism made up of the collective unconscious of all community members. Right now, that community collective unconscious is toxic, it reeks of elitism and bullying. While some may be subtle or overlooked. It is still there, like an open wound, or cancer, it is continuing to grow. I believe this will continue to grow, and will eventually be what creates the biggest obstacles in the ecosystem. Obviously, the tech is what brought us together. However, if we cannot rid the community of this toxicity we will not thrive. So, I am calling ALL devs. and ALL members of the dfinity foundation and the open internet foundation to essentially "cut the" for a lack of a better way of saying it, come together and help the community heal and then thrive. Right now, there is definitely a noticeable toxic work culture evolving. If this is not addressed internally, it will come out publicly and will be prolonged. I urge all members of the community to continue working toward collaboration, and then come up with a game plan to change the environment inside the community. There are some users, and stakeholders refusing to speak out of fear of the community repercussions. This is the start of what you are trying to dismantle. I urge community leaders to re-visit Karl Marx's Conflict theory and how it could be applied/ pertains to the community at this point in time. Then they need to outright address it. This type of internal conflict has destroyed civilizations. It needs addressed.

Hello,
The word detoxify the community seems to me extremely strong and rather than ignore the message, I wish to express my total disagreement with the content.
Regards

Could you tell us where you have experienced this? Im not entirely sure what you mean, but my interactions are quite limited.

infu | 2022-08-17 22:48:26 UTC | #4

I agree there is elitism, but I haven't seen someone bullying new users trying to understand IC.
I personally respond to 100% of the messages/questions I get. I am getting around 50% responses. It annoys me too, but it's fine, you build/join your own tribe. I don't think that is IC specific problem.

I've actually been impressed by how civil things are on this forum. I braced myself to be flamed due to my initial post being, well... something of a flame 🙄

Instead I was welcomed and the issue I raised was given due consideration. Like @Tbd, my experience with Dfinity is limited, but at least here I've been humbled by how patient the moderators and devs are, consistently giving the benefit of the doubt to questionable posts.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-18 04:20:44 UTC | #6

Sure! @Tbd @infu @Jonathan @rbolog 
In all honesty, I realized I should have edited this more and given it more input than I did. I realize after I shared, that the rhetoric used could have been confusing/ sound harsh to individuals. This was not my intention at all. I am accustomed to using such language inside academia that it carries over into my normal conversational speech. I apologize. 

I want to stress that this post was directed mainly at community leaders and all higher-level devs. to create/foster the environment needed for all users to then reciprocate their behavior in turn. I placed (or should have placed more) significant emphasis on the *start* of the creation of toxic work culture. You are correct, this is not something specifically related to the IC. Karl Marx's Conflict Theory, states that in any organization, culture, or community conflict arises. Then the logistics of what occurs when this takes place makes handling it detrimental not to the protocol itself but to the culture, the work environment, and the community. 
It then becomes all of your frustrations, all of your unheard and unanswered questions that then collectively become "our frustrations". So, yes, this is a known phenomenon that occurs in any organization. It certainly has been occurring long before and will occur long after the IC lol However, when it happens in the IC it then becomes (like I mentioned) a wound or cancer that slowly over time kills you from within. This is something that should start being addressed directly by community leaders (NOT all the average users turning into a mob and going one direction lol). Those involved will understand the depth and magnitude of what I speak.

I do not want to highlight specific moments on the forum, meetings, or other forms of communication because A. the community is reeling from community leaders and their unconscious or subliminal projected feelings, and B. it would continue fueling feelings towards individuals who are not directly responsible (this is a community issue after all) and C. it would/ could take away from my message and point I am/ tried to make.
I LOVE this community for better or worse lol That is what motivated me to make this post and try to voice this opinion. So, yes, in terms of comparing it to other digital communities yes, this one is great. Although, I am pointing out the start of this process being born before our eyes. This is something that occurs slowly over a period of time inside an organization or any business really. It's the fundamentals of organizational communication. 

If your interactions have been limited I urge you to do nothing. By that, I mean, sit back, and slowly observe the community in silence as a spectator. It does not pop up nearly half as much as other communities and organizations I will admit. However, when it pops up it's evident, and then it trickles down into unseen or unnoticed behaviors that over time destroy things from the inside out. It consumes a community like darkness and hate can consume a man's soul. I want and hoped to say all of this now before it ever became a full reality. Much like having a scan done, that detects early stages of cancer and then having it removed before it's problematic, or taking antibiotics when a bacterial infection sets in.

Then my final comment will be towards just "join your tribe and forget about it". I will agree and have to an extent, however, the IC is not a tribe IMO it should be looked at if anything as a brain. A brain needs homeostasis, it needs the right amount of this and that, or it creates instability, that in turn is reflected in our behavior, thoughts, feelings, etc., etc. I would urge community leaders and average users to not think of this as "find your project and stick with them" otherwise the divide I am speaking to will literally look like America rn. A sad pathetic divided nation is about to implode in itself if it doesn't pull it together. Except, an American moment like this happened a LONG time ago. We overlooked it all. Now, look at us today. I say this as a citizen of the USA and a stakeholder in IC lol Please hear my words community leaders. Consider this at the very least.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-18 04:30:47 UTC | #7

If you want to know when the moment in America was IMO go back to the year 1774-1776ish when Benjamin Franklin laid out all-inclusive language in the first draft of the declaration of independence that was then scrapped and turned into what we see today.

You said absolutely nothing substantive. No identification of problems, no ideas how to fix it, and nothing actionable for the reader to pursue.

Btw I’m not reading marx’s book. I could not give less of a shit about it.

This isnt your academic institution; waxing poetic about vague generalities is a waste of everyones time.

Hey, @Tromix this was not directed towards you or for you. Thanks for reading it though. Those who needed to hear it heard me. Your behavior is exactly what I was speaking to. So, if anything I greatly appreciate you making my point. 
Have a great day bud,

-------------------------

Tromix | 2022-08-19 21:11:21 UTC | #12

You’re welcome. You’re being disingenuous and trying to crybully your way into subverting the ecosystem to fit your ideological paradigm. You’re demanding the team prioritize your vastly unimportant world view, at the expense of progress of the ecosystem.

Stay mad if you like. Not my problem.

-------------------------

anonymous | 2022-08-19 22:34:14 UTC | #13

Yeah, and quite honestly, haven't come across any toxic behavior from those in the community, unlike other communities I've been a part of. 

Only time I can remember there being any toxic behavior is when the main telegram group was open and the market came crashing down, tanking the token, then all the trolls came in fudding and provoking people. Other than that, super friendly community.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-20 01:19:59 UTC | #14

Well, as you can see my case has been made for me. Thank's for helping shed light to the exact toxic behavior I am referring to. I'm not mad, I'm speaking to a much larger issue that you yourself are enabling and continuing to project on the rest of the community. You reek of toxicity, grab some febreeze and douse yourself with it. Because it's nasty (your attitude and domineer I mean).

Imagine thinking that any group you intrude upon and doesnt immediately cater to your 10-ply soft sensitivities/demands, is toxic.

Are you a minor instagram/tiktok celebrity? You’re so profoundly self centered and egotistical that its actually hilarious.

Best of luck in your life. Seriously.

plsak | 2022-08-20 09:06:17 UTC | #17

Hi @jsull9 and thank you for the topic.

My experience is different - I feel fair treatment (appropriate to my addition to the ecosystem) even from people with much higher education and with much more experience in relevant areas, but I understand that different people might feel in different way and **it is very important to be able to talk about these things freely**.

IMO most stakeholders are currently focused mainly on delivering on roadmap milestones (so I suppose sometimes someone might have been overlooked), but still I would encourage **(not only) dev/community leads** to read through similar topics and ask themselves **`What can I do more or better?`**.

I hope your experience improves in the near future and wish you the best of luck!

Yeah, that's just what we need here in the ICP ecosystem,  Marxism... not at all, I'm a fan of free speech and free thought, even when it offends some, I suggest that you learn how to debate, instead of trying to cancel others free speech to bring you out of your safe space.  I was attracted to ICP for what looks like a counterbalance to silicon valley cancel culture and allowing a few to control free speech, the reshaping of our realities...

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-24 06:30:18 UTC | #21

You may have misjudged me, my intention, or my reasoning behind the post. Admittedly, I did not fully equipped myself with community expectations of the forum. My knee-jerk emotional response did not help my case at all. I was emotionally charged that I will acknowledge for sure. I 100% was projecting some of my own biases and opinions in language used initially, and moving forward making me a hypocrite to some degree I'll humbly/ graciously admit. I am (as I mentioned I am only a mere student here). However, I am not advocating for censorship by any means. In hindsight referencing Karl Marx's Conflict Theory was/ may have been poor choice for the space perhaps. I know I am still fairly new, and the community has not properly interacted, nor engaged with me beyond the bits of what interactions we may have had, I only use social media apps developed by all of the amazing developers on the IC and this (no twitter anymore). Which brings me back to original point where I now see this was not perhaps the most appropriate setting, or way to go about it.
Either way, I used to many fancy Carl Jung references (because I'm a Jung fanboy), then my Karl Marx socialist theories was not so much for the socialist perspective his image can sometimes represent, and more on how to use the theory in context of various areas of organizational communication settings. Only as a frame work to understand these situations as they arise in ways that help build and shape communities, much like devs shape and build digital projects IMO and I did not use enough relevant material that would be considered inclusive/ on the other side/ different theoretical approaches or valid context to my concerns here on the IC. Also, I 100% agree I need to/ will continue working on writing more concessively, with more relevant information in the accustomed or unspoken manner the community pre-established itself with. I was perhaps most embarrassed by this aspect of my post.  

I take criticism well, just not attempts to diminish my integrity as a person or faith in the IC, or make me call out individuals in a public way that could deter anyone from speaking out in the future. Which is why I over shot my cards with seeking to hit, or tone in on the audience (in a way that was obviously not perceived well). I am here for all the same objectives, as the communitty perhaps for different reasons though. I do believe we all need (including myself to do a better job) at not making preconceived notions of each other and make room for an inclusive environment. In full disclosure, I have learning disabilities, and humbly admit where they can sometimes be problematic in my writing domineer, and perhaps spoke to my own shortcomings that this post failed in. 
You raise a valid point on being able to debate things (as even I myself would have liked to have seen). I am open for true debate. Not when its an out right attack or demoralizing of anyones (including my own) personal belief systems, which is the point of freedom of speech, to be able to have these differences and not feel community repercussions. EVEN if I was a die hard marxists (which it happens I'm not). I'm just a fan of the theoretical frameworks he established in areas that help make sense of other things. I should still be allowed to post about it and not have the community demoralize me and make personal provoking attacks etc., etc... Otherwise, that is not freedom of speech IMO, it's really just an echo chamber is it not? (I'm asking you tell me), and hey they can be fun don't get me wrong. I 

I don't believe this was intended, or I intended on being/ making it a debate though, and more for the advocacy of collaboration and unity through the conflicts we face, and the ever evolving pieces to a our community. 

It was a Huge learning experience and truly tested my own waters within the developing community to see the reactions, support and quick decisive action actually taken by leadership. Which if anything showed me they care enough to work with me through what appears to be something more than I bargained for. I think I really like @plsak comment most where he highlighted (not only) dev/ community leads but everyone including myself which obviously i owned/ admitted. I think some took this personally, and this was not my intention.I merely wanted to talk about this in some fashion. Otherwise, how would any of us (including myself) address it. Personally, that is what freedom of speech represent to me as an individual.

Stop being a snowflake. Icp is a great community and nobody needs to waste their time with your post. Stop wining. Everyone has the right to treat how they want on the internet, it’s free speech. Something your commie book doesn’t know about. The team is building a decentralized web. Decentralized web should support the freedom of speech. If someone hurts your feelings. Tough shit grow up. If you want to learn some stuff. Read through the forums and do some research. No dev is going to waste their time with simple questions that have been answered here a dozen times. Grow up and grow a pair commie

Quiet strange to me that in the same post, you are telling him to shut up and promote free speech.  You only shitpost back to him. I do not see the value of this. Overall, I think that many proposals and other stuff have divided the community and everything to suppress that division would be beneficial for IC. 
May be would be more productive to listen and understand why some people are so deceptive from IC, but are stuck in 8 years lock up because, at some point, there were really committed and strong believer to the network and from there, try to find solutions all together.

Thanks for saying something. I'm not mad personally. Sometimes when things happen though I do want and think I can just click dissolve lol I'm here for 8- 20 years is what I like to say when I'm emotionally heated. however when obvious things happen in various spaces of the iC it's like where do I go where this stops? It took me a long time to commit for the 8- 20 years, and yes it still has its moment and I just invested/ became heavily involved lol it's a journey though. I'm literally learning a whole new profession just for fun. I don't blame newer users seeking the answers. This tech and blockchain is fun and I love the community except when things like this constantly occur. It demoralizes the entire space. It isn't just with new users. This happens at all levels in the community. It was what I was trying to speak to, start a conversation about, and possibly inspire this great development team to be better overall.Ironically, I realize now I was not meaning this towards the foundation and rather certain developing projects within the space. Which was also embarrassing in itself. However, the newer users coming across FUD Fear Uncertainty and doubt should be met with FUD Facts Understanding and Determination. Not, silencing them with aggressive, provocative language and obscene comments.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-25 07:13:04 UTC | #27

If anything its individuals like this that make me still happy to be here, I encourage other users like you to keep standing up and say something when things like this occur in the space. It's a community issue that needs a cultural change or movement IMO.

-------------------------

pete-hun | 2022-08-25 07:21:49 UTC | #28

Everybody who invests their precious time in IC is equally important. Junior or less experienced developers should always be approached with a lot more patience and should receive more help than seasoned programmers. I am personally fine with the toxicity (harsh talk) you are writing about, but than I worked in this industry for more than 10 years and I know this is quiet general. I also do it, but only with my bosses and more experienced colleagues and never with junior, less experienced programmers.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-25 16:22:00 UTC | #29

I respect, and appreciate the actual input towards addressing this issue from this honest and respectful outlook. Out of curiousity though, did you do know that is considered abusive or toxic behavior in some cultures/ industries? In some industries (like where I am coming from), that level of disrespect would probably have me removed from any position held. I've had my fair share of slip ups. Lord knows that I get emotionally heated. I also know it is the internet and you are allowed to voice your opinion, however, it doesn't give you the right to take that from someone else with demoralizing or abusive language. That is toxic behavior. I'm not saying be perfect all the time, but blatant disrespect, and making direct comments towards people, or then using it as a means to subvert their silence is not the true meaning or definition of freedom of speech. 
In fact, that is exactly why cancel culture was created. For this exact reason. To call out other members of the community (myself included) when we are acting out of line, and say "knock it off" essentially. It's not about who is right, and who is wrong, it's about *not* trying to publicly humiliate individuals, and (or) suppress their individual thinking. On the lower level of the community, individuals do things, and make direct comments like this when they see an opportunity, it normally starts or is deliberated from another source (often leadership) that they are projecting imo. 
It often starts inside public meetings hosted in developer projects, and live stream sessions where all of these individuals start soaking this information in. They then project the same ideologies as the person they absorb the most information from.Which is then internalized and leaves the impression or stain on the overall brand. It is what makes me so passionate about directly engaging in conversation to address in this space in particular. Imo it isn't/ shouldn't be about cancel culture, and about treating others with respect.You really do internalize all of those subtle passive aggressive inside scripts with each other, and after a while you start to immediately assume and expect the worst of people. Especially, if it is a prolific member of the community, using their base or following to do so. I think it starts with miss communication, and trickles into longer lasting effects than even I can realize or give tangible value to. 

I actually like the idea of not trying to remove individuals who make obscene comments like this out of respect to their freedom of speech. However, I do think it should be addressed, and not just by one person. I think it would foster an environment for individuals to talk about it, and then not alienate them, after the community perhaps makes them feel rejected or canceled for saying something. From personal experience, it makes you feel the same insignificance, that you were projecting onto the individual, and that is not what I would want either. If anything I would want to allow them the platform to openly apologize, acknowledge it. This way perhaps it actually stops, and doesn't make them in turn feel smaller and they project those feelings further.

The guys trying to make the place a safe space which is limiting free speech and is basically supporting censorship. Yeah he has the right to say it and I’m fine with him saying it but his whole op contradicts web 3 entirely don’t think it should be supported at all

Do you not support free speech? Because this is what you get with free speech.

Jabberwocky | 2022-08-26 16:59:53 UTC | #32

You support the freedom of speech but want to stop toxic behavior. That is a contradiction in itself. Do you support freedom of speech or limited speech? Because that whole paragraph you just wrote pretty much states you support limited speech

kpeacock | 2022-08-26 17:12:01 UTC | #33

I kinda think "free speech" is a bit of a [thought-terminating cliche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9). It's a loaded term and you're using it here to excuse rudeness. For what? Credibility and respect are things that people earn through effort and building rapport with each other, and free speech is an irrelevant U.S. legal concept

@jsull9 This post may have been unnecessary - talking about "toxicity" invites people to disagree and flame, and it's pretty hard to get useful, concrete action out of an unstructured format like a forum post. 

For my end, I have found the IC community to be fairly positive overall, particularly given the overall culture of crypto / web3. I appreciate everyone who puts in the work, both in the developer ecosystem and in building a culture that is collaborative and nice to be around ❤️

jsull9 | 2022-08-26 17:20:26 UTC | #34

@kpeacock I agree if you read my rants I quickly understood the forum was not the right setting. I was trying something that did not work or was not perceived well, and I did it emotionally charged, because of multiple reasons I won't disclose. I wanted to delete the post to remove it for the exact reasons you speak too. However, I am not sure how to do so if I can be honest. I haven't truly interacted in the public forum or online social media platforms in over 5-7 years. If anything I read from a distance with no actual account. This was a learning curve. I do apologize and honestly would love feedback on how to remove it from the forum overall. I'd prefer to remove the constant headache that was completely unintended and meant as a healthy discussion amongst community members to discuss these issues as they arise.
