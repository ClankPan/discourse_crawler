Canisters cannot be called. Error reason: call poll fail with status rejected [] []

candid:

type  Transaction  = record{
     to: principal;
     amount: nat;
     token_canister: principal;
};

type Block = record {
     propose_id: nat;
     transactions: vec Transaction;
};

service:{
    "propose":(Block) ->(nat);
}
