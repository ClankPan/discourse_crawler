Hi everyone

I've been working on an IC dapp concept for crowdfunding the release of intellectual property. It implements a novel funding protocol to mitigate the free-rider problem and enable efficient price discovery. I'm looking to collaborate with a developer to apply for a Dfinity Foundation grant. If you have an interest in this field or would like to know more, give me a shout.

Cheers,
Malcolm
