How come it is not possible to have a function like this:

public query shared(msg) lookUpMyAccount(): async () {
  accountsTable.get(msg.caller)
}

I figured since it's still a read-only action, an actor should be able to call a query function passing in the msg.caller information. I get unexpected token "shared".

Can one get the msg.caller for a query function?

Try:

```
public shared query(msg) func lookUpMyAccount(): async () {
  accountsTable.get(msg.caller)
}
```

(See production `<shared_pat_opt>` in the grammar at https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko-grammar.html)

(You've got `shared` after `query` and were missing the `func` keyword.)
