The mainnet ic url from [ic-repl](https://github.com/chenyan2002/ic-repl) is https://ic0.app. However, I wish to connect to my own ic url which probably runs at http://localhost:8000 and has a definited API address /api/v2/status. How can I achieve this? Should I run with dfinity/ic code in localhost port 8000?

Error trace:

```
Ping http://localhost:8000/...

Based on the error message, you didn't actually start a local replica. Did you run `dfx start`?

Is there a way to run the source of dfx (probably a rust program) that may exist in the [ic](https://github.com/dfinity/ic) repo?

Unlike https://ic0.app, starting a replica at local does not guarantee the path (/api/v2/status) was exists.

The error message now is 404:

```
ic-repl -r local

It should work with `dfx 0.7.0`. The default url is `http://localhost:8000`. You can also specify the a replica url via `ic-repl -r http://localhost:8001`

Thanks. Upgrading to v0.7.0 solved my problem.

The `dfx` source code lives in a separate repository that isnâ€™t open sourced yet, but will be eventually.
