When we set up custom domains either via the boundary nodes as described in the docs or via the service worker (the old approach), won't this cause duplicate content issues? And if not: Can somebody explain why? My thinking always was that we should not have the same content on two domains and CANISTER_ID.icp0.io obviously is a domain. Or does it do a 301 redirect, which would be the typical SEO way to solve this, if we follow [the docs for custom domains on boundary nodes](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/custom-domains/using-custom-domains/#custom-domains-on-the-boundary-nodes)?

Indeed, it's might be indexed twice unless Google is clever enough to recognize it's the same content. To prevent this issue, it's best practice I think to add a `canonical` meta tag to your app/site.

Example:

```
<html lang="en">
  <head>
     <link href="https://juno.build" rel="canonical" />
```
