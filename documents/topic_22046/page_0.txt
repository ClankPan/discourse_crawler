I'm trying to register my domain on boundary nodes, I'm in step 3 of the process. when I run the command below, 

    curl -sLv -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        https://icp0.io/registrations \
        --data @- <<EOF
    {
        "name": "joinedafrica.com"
    }
    EOF
    
I get this error "domain is missing from canister fo2ol-uqaaa-aaaap-abdna-cai list of known domains" Meanwhile I've added "joinedafrica.com" in the list of known domains. 

I've also attached my GitHub repo: [https://github.com/aginamena/Joinedafrica.com](https://github.com/aginamena/Joinedafrica.com)

Here's my DNS record from Cloudflare

Hi, as I mentioned to you on Discord, there is an issue with your [https://fo2ol-uqaaa-aaaap-abdna-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains](https://fo2ol-uqaaa-aaaap-abdna-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains) that is not returning the expected content. Once this is resolved, you'll be able to proceed further.
