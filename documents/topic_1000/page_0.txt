Greetings, community!

`V0.6.2` of the SDK is now available for download! :rocket:

The `0.6.2` release only includes one important user-facing change which is also a breaking change that will require an update to all existing projects.

In this release, all canister identifiers are generated using a text-based representation. To work with the `0.6.2` release, therefore, you must update your projects to use the new canister identifier format. Detailed instructions on how to do so can be found in the complete release notes [here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/sdk-release-notes.html), along with a summary of the recent features and fixes from `0.6.0` and `0.6.1`.

Cheers!
