Hello everyone,
I am reaching out to inquire about the ICDEX project and its relationship with the DFINITY Foundation. I'm interested in understanding more about the trustworthiness of the ICDEX team and their collaboration with DFINITY.

Could anyone kindly provide insights or share any relevant information regarding the credibility of the ICDEX project and the nature of its association with the DFINITY Foundation? 
Thank you
