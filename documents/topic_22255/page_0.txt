The GIX team proposed an nns-dapp hotfix, which addresses two issues:

- **Modclub** SNS set `min_participant_icp_e8s: 100000278`, which the nns-dapp UI rounds to 1.00 ICP. The nns-dapp now renders the full value up to 8 decimals.

- The new proposal also prevents from showing hardware wallet accounts in the swap participation flow.

The proposal is number [124252](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124252)
