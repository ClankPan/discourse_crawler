This release makes the following two changes to the asset settings (.ic-assets.json) in new projects.  
- adds https://icp-api.io to the `connect-src` list in the Content-Security-Policy header.
- no longer specifies a value for `allow_raw_access`.

While the above only changes files in new projects, this release also changes the default value of `allow_raw_access` from `false` to `true`.  This means for projects that don't specify a value, the asset canister will allow raw access after the next deploy.
