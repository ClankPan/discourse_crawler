The longer I spend thinking about the possibilities with the internet computer the more I study coding and infrastructure design and I just have to say how inspiring it is to think multi dimensionally- even if it’s all a dream it was worth it so thank u . I never thought I would pick up programming .  But here I am somehow ! Still and I can’t stop coming up with ideas , promoting the organization, and thinking of new apps to build .
