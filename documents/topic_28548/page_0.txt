Everyone should not focus on the same neuron. This will lead to centralized voting, lose the meaning of community, and also bring risks to the treasury. I hope everyone will consider it carefully and be responsible for their own funds and the community.

This is true, Make sure to untick funding proposal while follow dev neuron. But follow on sns upgrades will help them to faster upgradation.

What @ICdex said is correct.
The reason to follow "dev neuron" is to push the developer updates.

There will be times when we need to push urgent development updates that are better to be updated than be waiting for a 4 days' voting period. 

As @Antony mentioned there is option to untick funding proposal.
