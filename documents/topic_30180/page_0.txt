Hi! I think HTTPS outcalls are great, but they donâ€™t completely solve the oracle problem. I wrote a blog post titled [Extending HTTPS outcalls](https://mmapped.blog/posts/27-extending-https-outcalls) that explores how to extend this IC feature to be on par with the industry-standard solutions. In a nutshell, the proposal is for the calling canister to be able to inspect and aggregate responses from all nodes.

Do you have use-cases that will benefit from this extension?
