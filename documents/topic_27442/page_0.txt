Azle has a custom build process, and I am trying to construct the full URL that the developer should use to interact with their REST-based Azle canisters. The problem is that I don't believe the build script has the replica's port available to it.

I see there are some environment variables like `DFX_VERSION` and `DFX_NETWORK`, and maybe `CANISTER_ID` (not sure if these are some of our own).

Can we have the port? And really anything that would be required to construct this and display it to the user: `http://canisterId.localhost:8000`. I think we just need the canister id and the port.

There is `dfx info replica-port` and `dfx info webserver-port`. Can you work with that or do you need something different?

I can work with that for now, I wonder if an environment variable would be better? But yes I am unblocked thanks!
