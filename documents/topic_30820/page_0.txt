Hello everyone,
I receive this error when I am trying to run "dfx deploy":

Deploying all canisters.
All canisters have already been created.
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
Error: The post-build step failed for canister 'ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai' with an embedded error: The command '"npm" "run" "build"' failed with exit status 'exit status: 255'.
Stdout:

> token_frontend@0.1.0 prebuild
> npm run generate


> token_frontend@0.1.0 generate
> dfx generate token_v3_backend


Stderr:
Error: Cannot find canister 'token_v3_backend'.

My dfx version is 0.9.3 and node version is 16.20.2.
I didn't find a topic with this issue. :)
Please help me! Thank you!

Do consider upgrading your dfx, you can use this guide https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-dfx-version-manager-dfxvm-version-1-0-0-is-released/27720
Secondly you can check your canister dependencies in dfx.json file, remove any unwanted dependence.
