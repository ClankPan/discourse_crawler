I'm looking for any live canisters or wallets that support the ICRC-7 standard. Ideally, a browser extension wallet to see if a user can transfer ICRC-7 canisters as expected. But any ICRC-7 canister might be helpful.

That's for testing the canisters deployed with https://www.communities.ooo/ that support the standard (this is our [implementation](https://github.com/LiveDuo/communities/blob/master/src/_child/backend/icrc7.rs)).

Are there any canisters or wallets that support the standard right now?

I know that Plug does, but only for collections that are registered with dab.ooo AFAIK (for now).

Sounds like they might get universal support sooner rather later! Will keep an eye

Interesting tool! Any more info on that canister and how it's meant to be used?

Also [Slide](https://etk52-fqaaa-aaaak-ae4ca-cai.icp0.io) wallet will soon have ICRC-7 support, this wallet is still work in progress so use at your own risk.

Keep in mind ICRC-7 (and 37) define non fungible token standards. But for main stream adoption by wallets and marketplaces, the work on a basic metadata standard needs to be completed first.

For example a wallet wouldn't know what metadata field refers to the image of an NFT without any standards regarding the metadata structure and fields itself. This work is ongoing in NFT working group, feel free to join the discussions on the Tuesday meetings.
