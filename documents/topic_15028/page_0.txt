I am trying to host my ICP project using fleek. I am following this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx9mCg7iXB0 and this github link https://github.com/FleekHQ/IC-Deploy-Action for that.

At this step I found out that I don't have any wallet.json file in my system. Does anyone know, why and how can I create that file?

dfx dev here, I likely cannot help with anything besides the `wallets.json` file.

The code above assumes that
- you have a wallet configured and
- you have it configured for the identity called `default`

Every identity that has a wallet configured has the file `~/.config/dfx/identity/<identity name>/wallets.json`.
If you have no identity with a configured wallet, please follow the [instructions here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/network-quickstart#creating-a-cycles-wallet) to create a wallet yourself (or go through the [faucet](https://faucet.dfinity.org)).
If you have an identity with a wallet already, you just have to navigate to the right identity's folder.
If you have a wallet, but it's not configured in dfx, you can use `dfx identity set-wallet` (choose the right network with `--network`).

Hi Severin, I have gone through the [artice](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/network-quickstart/#creating-a-cycles-wallet) and try to create a wallet. But unfortunately stuck in the command, 
```
dfx ledger --network ic create-canister <principal-identifier> --amount <icp-tokens>
``` 
since i don't any icp tokens with me yet :sweat_smile:
Have asked for faucet, waiting for the confirmation from them. 

Thank you for replying.
