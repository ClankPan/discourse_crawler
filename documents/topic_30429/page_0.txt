When I try to deploy the SNS testflight on mainnet, I keep on getting an error that `--network ic` is not a valid argument. I'm following the guide [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/testing/testing-on-mainnet#steps-to-run-a-testflight) and am running this command 

```sh
dfx sns deploy-testflight --init-config-file="sns/sns_init.yaml" --network ic 
```

This returns the error 

```sh
error: unexpected argument 'ic' found

Usage: dfx sns deploy-testflight [OPTIONS] [init-config-file] [network]

For more information, try '--help'.
```

I tried placing `--network ic` at other places but same error.

I'm running with the defined versions in the guide (0.16.1) but also tried with 0.19.0 (0.20.0 doesn't support sns extension yet as it seems).

Am I missing something here?

Well ok, I had to set `--network=ic` (including the =) and that makes it work. Can be adjusted in the guide.

I ran into a follow-up error at the step which installs the sns_index canister

```sh
Error: Failed to install wasm module to canister 'sns_index'.
Caused by: Failed to install wasm module to canister 'sns_index'.
  Failed to read ./ic-icrc1-index-ng.wasm: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

I could resolve this by changing the name of the `ic-icrc1-index.wasm` file to `ic-icrc1-index-ng.wasm`. However, those are the default files which are downloaded [in the step beforehand](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/testing/testing-on-mainnet#step-1-import-and-download-sns-canisters). Fixing this, let's me run the testflight deployment until the deployment of the sns_index canister again. I then receive this error

```sh

```
Something seems to be wrong with the install arguments. 

Running the deployment of the sns_index canister manually by running the command directly with my staging sns_ledger canister, works.

```
dfx canister install sns_index --argument '(record {ledger_id = principal "j5naj-nqaaa-aaaal-ajc7q-cai"})' --ic --wasm ./ic-icrc1-index-ng.wasm
```

So this is where I am now. Because I had to finish the last step manually, I'm not sure if there is something that is supposed to happen in the `dfx sns deploy-testflight` that would finalise the launch. The testing SNS seems to work just fine, judging from the first test proposals.
