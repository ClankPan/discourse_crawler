There might be some issue with the EVM RPC api key for Arbitrum/Ankr. 

First I got inconsistent responses when querying the fee history on BlockPi/Ankr. 

And then this when calling `eth_sendRawTransaction`: 

```
... rpc.ankr.com/arbitrum, with payload: 
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendRawTransaction","id":62,"params":
["0x02f901ce82a4b18080839896 ...

...

MultiSendRawTransaction: Consistent(Err(JsonRpcError(JsonRpcError 
{ code: -32053, message: "API key is not allowed to access method" })))
```

I stopped using Ankr/Arbitrum for the moment and use only BlockPi now with no issues.

Thanks for the heads-up! Did you encounter this error on the mainnet or local replica? I tried to repro this and received a similar error message locally, while everything worked as expected on mainnet. 

As a temporary workaround, you could register a new provider with a custom API key ([documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc/evm-rpc-canister#registering-your-own-provider)). We will look into providing a default API key for the Ankr L2 endpoints.
