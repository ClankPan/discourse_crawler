Hi everyone,

June is almost over and we want to share our roadmap for July! You can find the previous roadmap update (for June) here: [Internet Identity Roadmap Update, June 2022](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-roadmap-update-june-2022/13430?u=nmattia)

Here's how things are looking for July:

Again, guesstimate at best, and we'll probably reshuffle and reprioritize a few things during the month.

Here are a few notes:
* As you can see, "Protected Recovery Phrases" is still around. Life got in the way and this took a bit longer than expected, but we'll be releasing that in the next few days. Make sure to subscribe to [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/protected-recovery-phrases-plan-and-progress/12950?u=nmattia) for updates.
* Pretty much all our Haskell tests have been ported to rust (I did shed a functional tear) thanks for @frederikrothenberger 's relentless work of porting and improving our canister tests.
* In July our highest priority will be to provide solutions for dapps to _change_ domain names. Right now, changing domain name (e.g. `my-canister.ic0.app` to `hello.com`) would change all the pseudonyms (IDs) generated for users, meaning the dapp would not recognize a returning user. We (well, @frederikrothenberger mostly, I'll be enjoying the sun on remote beaches) will make sure the transition is seamless between the two domains. More info on that soon.
* We have a few people from other teams that'll lend a helping hand with the CSS & HTML (though don't expect anything too drastic) and with migrating the II canister to a different subnet (which we need because of _reasons_)
* We'll then also start thinking about how we can safely migrate Internet Identity to a _new_ domain, probably something like https://internetidentity.org, which has lots of unknowns, but which we also really need (due to bad content uploaded on the IC there's a non-zero risk that ic0 will get blacklisted by some platforms). We'll keep everyone posted on this.
* "3rd Party Attributes" is just a renamed of "Integration with II", i.e. integration of other auth providers with II.
* This didn't even last long enough to be shown on either the June or the July update, but we did a lot of work making sure that our builds can be reproduced, so that everyone can check that what is installed on the IC is indeed what's in[ the GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity). 
* Let's not forget @frederikrothenberger's life changing single click auth change, which you can read about [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/streamlined-internet-identity-authentication-flow-now-just-a-single-click/13582?u=nmattia)!

I'll be out for a few weeks, so I wish you all a very nice start in the summer! üèù
