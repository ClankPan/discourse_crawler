The [FAQ](https://dfinity.org/faq/how-can-the-internet-computer-undo-the-monopolization-of-the-internet) says that transforming a service to an Open Internet Service entails:

```they would then upload an autonomous tokenized governance canister, and then irrevocably transfer control of the new service to this (so that it becomes part of that autonomous system). Of course, at this stage they would hold all the governance tokens, but their aim would be to divest themselves of tokens over time to fund development and incentivize contributors, such that eventually they hold only a minority stake and the service becomes truly “open”```

Where can I find more details about this process? How do I upload this tokenized governance canister? How do I specify the account that the initial governance tokens get transferred to? How would I divest myself of these tokens - would I need to manually list the token on various exchanges? Is there a separate UI similar to the NNS UI for governance of this Open Internet Service that is automatically created?

I have so many questions about this process. I'm guessing there aren't any Open Internet Services currently. However, I think OISs are a key differentiator between dapps on the IC and web apps on the traditional web. Any insight into this - including timelines - would be appreciated.

Following up on this, I saw in Dominic's medium [post](https://medium.com/dfinity/announcing-internet-computer-mainnet-and-a-20-year-roadmap-790e56cbe04a) that:

```When a service is transformed into an open internet service, the NNS initializes a new tokenized governance system to which it passes control. The new governance system initially contains one billion native governance tokens, and these are passed to whomever took the action.```

Does the NNS initialize this for us? I thought we had to implement it ourselves in the spirit of this [tutorial](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education/governance) (and thus choose our own initial number of tokens).

Can someone please clarify?
