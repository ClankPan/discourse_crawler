Hi,
Does anyone know a way to convert ICP to cycles using cycles minter canister ?
How can I interact with that canister from motoko ?
Any examples ?

Someone else could surely be of more help but as a starting point:

I've looked what the `dfx ledger topup` command does under the hood. The most interesting part is here:
https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/f8f005259b93f02d6dfd57dc7fba88fd109d0822/src/dfx/src/commands/ledger/mod.rs#L175

So as far as I understand, you transfer ICP to a subaccount of the (Cycle Management Canister) which references the principal you want to send the cycles to and then you [notify the CMC canister](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/f8f005259b93f02d6dfd57dc7fba88fd109d0822/src/dfx/src/commands/ledger/mod.rs#L220) about it.

This means you have to call a function on the ledger canister and on the CMC canister from your canister in Motoko.
