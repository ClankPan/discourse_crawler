I am very curious about Dfinity's identity and account. It seems to have some DID patterns. [Identity](http://identity.ic0.app/) is not just a pair of public and private keys, because I see that multiple devices can be bound to the same user number. It's the same as [account](https://nns.ic0.app/#/accounts) that can also generate Linked-account.

Here is my questions:
1. The hex string of a account is the public key (or public key's hash) of a private key?
2. New a linked-account does not require fingerprint authentication, that's to say linked-account has nothing to do with private key in security chip, so where is the private key of linked-account?
3. How to use an account to ensure better privacy? should I change Linked-account every different transaction? or something else like this.
