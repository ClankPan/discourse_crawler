Hi. I spent a lot of time with this tutorial and several things are wrong with it.

**1 - The canister name in the dfx.json file in the step 3 is not the same in the step 5 :**
:point_right: "custom-ledger" vs "ledger"

![dnt2|690x301](upload://3OC1ok5krVVKSXaWRMFoAKMg57Q.png)

**2 -  In the step 4** :
For me under debian, the export TOKEN_NAME variable set with double quotes don't work (like spaces in the variable...). But the main problem is in the arguments. In the "ledger.private.did" file, there no "name" & "symbol" properties. Instead, there are the "token_name" & "token_symbol" properties.

So after considering these changes, the command line below finally works
```
dfx canister --network ${NETWORK} call ledger symbol
```
