As you can see, since the 13/06, the telegram channel ¬´ Dfinity announcements ¬ª is not updated anymore. At the same time, telegram accepts BTC. So let us keep the presence of Dfinity on telegram as shiny as possible.

A guess from internally asking around: 
it is likely the result of Twitter disabling the API access, so bots stopped working. If people looking after the channel can change the bot to use the RSS feed of Dfinity instead, it will probably start working again.
