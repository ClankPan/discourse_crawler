How to use in JavaScript/TypeScript `HttpAgent` (if needed) and `Actor.createActor` to send a message with default identity (I assume, it's `aaaaa-aa`)?

I ask because my call without any identity to a non-query method fails with something about signature verification. So, I assume, it should have some identity and default identity would suit.

The default one generated by the bindings should be enough: https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/internet_identity_integration/src/greet_frontend/src/index.js#L5

The default identity (called the 'anonymous' identity) is `2vxsx-fae`. The identity `aaaaa-aa` is the management canister. No call will ever come from that identity
