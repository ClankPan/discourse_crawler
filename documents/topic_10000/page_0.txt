Hi,

I am implementing the base58 encoding/decoding algorithm in Motoko. To do this implementations I need to do multiplication, addition, module and residual with very big numbers. Is there a "big integer" library in Motoko? 

Thank you,

The `Nat` and `Int` types of Motoko are unbounded, so no need for a library here!
