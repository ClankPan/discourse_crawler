Someone can help me understand the reason I see MacBook-Pro ~ % dfx --version
dfx 0.9.3

but when  try to get on dfx in visual studio asking me  dfx --version
error: dfx 0.8.4 is not installed.  To install it, run:
error:     dfxvm install 0.8.4??

I tried use chatgpt to help but after 3 hours still same issue.

Thanks!

You are probably pinning a dfx version in `dfx.json` like this:

```json
"dfx": "0.8.4",
```
If you simply delete this line things should work just fine.

But 0.9.3 and 0.8.4 are both _very_ old (>2 years). I suggest you use a more current version

Hi Severin, 

thanks for your replay. Understand but did not resolve the issue. 
Uninstall Old** **dfx** **Versions**
Install the Latest** **dfx** **Version**
**Verify Installation**

But the same...
On my mac terminal shows:
 % dfx --version dfx 0.22.0
On Code Visual studio dfx --version
dfx 0.8.4

can you show your project's `dfx.json` and what `which dfx` shows in your VSCode terminal?

My bet, you mentioned in the first replay. Yes, right is on the "dfx.json " file , "0.8.4". Fixed.

Thanks Severin for your prompt response !!
