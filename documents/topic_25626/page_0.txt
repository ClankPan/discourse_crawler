What other interfaces should I implement apart from cycles management (to keep it alive) and ingress message inspection (to mitigate some attacks)? I ask because there might be something that missed.

The wiki article looks (still) reasonable. I can also recommend this page: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/security/rust-canister-development-security-best-practices, but to make better recommendations you'd have to share a few more bits of information. What are your requirements? Should the canister be DAO-controlled? blackholed? Should it be self-sufficient? What are your security assumptions?
