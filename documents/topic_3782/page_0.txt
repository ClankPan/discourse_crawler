I didnt see this in the specification but how is the "effective-canister-id" variable supposed to be coded into the api-endpoint-url? is it as the canister's-principal's-textual-representation(grouped(base32(crc32(b)b)))? or a string of its bits or bytes? i looked in the javascript agent and it looks from there that its using the canister's-textual-representation as the effective-canister-id in the api-url-endpoint but i didnt see that in the spec, the spec says that the textual-representation of a canister is not used in the system interface?

Good question! It’s the textual representation. And indeed the line

> In these paths, the `<effective_canister_id>` is the [ *effective* canister id](https://docs.dfinity.systems/public/#http-effective-canister-id).

should be

> In these paths, the `<effective_canister_id>` is the textual representation of the [ *effective* canister id](https://docs.dfinity.systems/public/#http-effective-canister-id).

I’ll update this internally, may take a while to propagate out. Thanks!
