I don't know who is responsible of doing slides at Dfinity but I absolutely love the work. 

I know that the [infographic](https://internetcomputer.org/icig.pdf) is available online but I cannot find any other slides (old ones that were used around Genesis or the one recently used in the [Wanxiang Global Blockchain Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8DKQVoUSyY) ).

Is there a place where all the slides are stored? Can we access it? 
Can we reuse part of the slides to create educational content? (I've already done it so I'm hopping I won't go to jail).

If someone is looking, I've accidentally find a part of the answer here : https://dfinity.org/scientific-publications
