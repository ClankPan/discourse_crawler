I am wondering if people will find an agent implemented in C++ useful (similar to the Rust and JS agents)?

Good discussion to have!

The main use case, I've seen thus far is an agent that can be used within [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) for game/metaverse development, similar to the C# agent [ICP.NET](https://github.com/BoomDAO/ICP.NET) that is used within [Unity](https://unity.com/).

We've funded the initial development of a C/C++ wrapper for the Rust agent: https://github.com/Zondax/icp-client-cpp

However, I'm still wondering if this was the right path since the main difficulty seems to be to support all the different platforms Unreal Engine targets, but it seems the most important are PC/Mac.

Btw. you can see a list of all agents/client libraries that have been developed here: https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-internet-computer#client-libraries-agents
