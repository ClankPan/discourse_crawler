Hey @dominicwilliams,

To continue [the discussion](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-is-the-bar-for-a-project-decentralizing-with-the-sns/19906/7?u=roman), I wanted to let you know that Electronic Arts (Maxis) plan a new economic design for their next game : the Sims 5. More precisely, [they plan to integrate a marketplace based on a myriad of microtransactions rather than keeping their current model.](https://simscommunity.info/2023/06/28/the-sims-5-free-to-play/)

As you may know, the sims represent a market of **70 millions** of players. The game will be out in a few years, but they are looking for some designer of their next marketplace and monetization now :

ICP could be the perfect "myelin". How about approaching them to introduce ICP to them ?

While it would be ideal, I'm skeptical that a major corporation like EA would embrace IC at this stage. The platform is still under development and the user base is not yet large enough to appeal to such a large company. However, I've been wrong before, so if anyone has the ability to attract EA, by all means, go for it.
