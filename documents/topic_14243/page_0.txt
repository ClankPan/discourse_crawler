When I tried to execute the command **dfx deploy** for Unity WebGL sample code, I am getting the following error.
I am very new to the ICP developer environment. 

https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/hosting/unity-webgl-template

Error: Failed to get wallet canister caller for identity 'default' on network 'local'.
Caused by: Failed to get wallet canister caller for identity 'default' on network 'local'.

What command is failing for you? I assume it's `dfx deploy`.

Most likely you have some interference between different deployments. If you run `dfx stop` and then `dfx start --background --clean`, it will clear any previously saved state. Make sure you're in the right directory when you run `dfx start`.

I tried this. Still, the error is persistent for this particular example. I created a sample application from scratch which is working fine( Not WebGL).

Cannot reproduce; it works on my machine.

Hmm... The error says that there is a wallet configured for the identity, which should be forgotten when running `dfx start` with `--clean`. Are you sure that you're running `dfx start --clean` in the same directory as `dfx deploy`? Another option is to `rm .dfx` before `dfx start --clean` in the unity project folder since that info would be saved there.

I will try the last command and build again.

have u set up it on a mac system?
I made a slighter Adjustment in dfx version. 
The project file has an old version of dfx. I manually changed it to the latest one.

Yes, I'm on an M1 Mac. I just tried with the new/current version of dfx and it works as well for me.

Wow. It's Worked today. When I used the echo command to change the dfx version the actual problem occurred. 
I love ICP blockchain and wanted to introduce this to the XR.

Thanks A lot.

I would like to post a small video on LinkedIn.
