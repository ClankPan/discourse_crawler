If IC never claim node’s state data is private, why keep the data in secret but not allow the community to sync it?

rify that the node provider is running the software as expected? Unless they open the block data and let community full nodes verify it. Even tho the code is open sourced, how do you verify the node provider’s software. Same as you can’t verify AWS even they claiming they are running the open sourced linux

Well, Dfinity started this forum post to ask whether we (users) want that some subnets expose the block data. So, I don't think is a secret but a non implemented feature and they want to know how important is this feature for us (users) so they can assign a development priority

Hey everybody! Let's please try to keep this thread on topic: do you want public subnets or not, should the NNS subnet be public, and please share if you have any ideas about how concretely you'd want this to work. 

We are drafting a motion proposal to make the the NNS blockchain public that we hope to share here tomorrow, and then we can also get a better sense of what the voters really want.

[/quote]

The topic of the thread is discussing "public subnets", not just the NNS one. However, I will quickly deal with the NNS subnet first, per your request.

I think there is already widespread agreement to make the NNS subnet public. Without this, there can be no public verifiability of core blockchain activity, such as ICP transfers, neuron balances, BTC/ETH transfers on the IC, etc. Moreover, DEFI on the IC cannot reasonably become mainstream without this transparency. To be more concrete, I would want to see blockchain-tracking websites like https://bitquery.io/ have an easy way to include ICP in their database of blockchain activity. That way, anyone could see what is happening to ICP on the public NNS subnet without any programming skills.

As for other subnets, I think DFINITY really needs to acknowledge a couple of major contradictions that cannot ever be resolved, which I was not previously aware of until this thread: 
1. That there is a fundamental contradiction between private data and blockchain transparency/verifiability, and 
2. That it is generally not viable for the IC to run any B2B (or "enterprise") software applications without exposing private individual or organizational data to an unacceptable extent, at least from the perspective of most companies today. 

For the latter, cybersecurity measures like firewalls and VPN tunnels in a Web2 world serve to keep decrypted data secure as it is processed behind a web server. With **any** Web3 solution (not just from the IC) that discards these Web2 cybersecurity measures, data is no longer safe when it is processed in decrypted format on an IC node. That means all sensitive data like regulated Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") must be decrypted only on a client device (e.g., phone or laptop), never on a Web3 server. To help you understand this logic, just keep in mind that this is why both hardware and software wallet private keys must only be accessible via authorized client-controlled devices, never via a public server. 

As a result of this fundamental restriction imposed by **all** blockchain technology, this makes all server-based applications on the IC nonviable if they contain any sensitive data. This would explain why we see no ERP applications, CRM applications, healthcare applications, etc. as projects being built on the IC. We see only B2C applications (e.g., personal banking on a client device) or server-based applications containing nonsensitive data (e.g., social media, gaming, etc.). Please correct me if I'm mistaken here, since this is quite a stunning point if true.

All of these limitations on public vs. private subnets get at the heart of the entire "World Computer" marketing message by DFINITY and how their Web3 vision can replace all cybersecurity costs in our Web2 world. As @bitbruce and @Astrapolis-peasant convinced me, I think this radically open internet vision is basically a fantasy, at least under the premise of a world where we still care so fanatically about our "private data". 

Perhaps in a future world where there is dramatically less concentration of corporate and political power to abuse this private data, we might not be so (justifiably) fanatical about what must remain "private". Unfortunately, that future world is not coming anytime soon, even though I still plan to do my part to help make that world happen. All of this is of course much bigger than just a criticism of the IC. It is a criticism of the entire Web3 vision being based entirely on a decentralization of infrastructure. A true Web3 vision needs to be far broader to include a radical decentralization of organizational and social power as well, which is what I am personally focused upon.

The thing that attracted me to the IC at first was the privacy aspect. While I do see the benefit public subnets could bring for transparency; an audited DApp with an event stream (like the ledger) gives the same level of confidence. Personally, I wouldn't want this prioritized, and if all subnets went public it would be a dealbreaker.

I guess it's not the exact same level of confidence because in that scenario you wouldn't be able to tell if the subnet itself was malfunctioning.

But that has never been there in the first place, has it?

We are trading the fake guarantee of privacy that's based on the assumption node providers will never read/share subnet data for dApp and subnet verifiability. 

On top of it the apparent privacy offered by the protocol disappears and it becomes more evident it's up to the devs to guarantee safery for their dApps data, which is something they should do regardless. I see this as an absolute win.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2022-12-14 23:35:19 UTC | #113

To me there is a huge difference between everything being publicly available all the time vs. data *maybe* being snooped on by node providers / boundary nodes. Yes, if you need absolute true privacy data will need to be encrypted. But, I think for many applications the current configuration offers a decent-enough level of pseudo-privacy.

To be clear. I do think adding public subnets would be a useful thing. But, I think *only having* public subnets would be a bad decremental to the ecosystem.

Yes. Such a thing has never existed from the beginning, and there will never be secure protection of unencrypted private data on IC. It's not a technical problem, it's a basic logic problem.

Everyone must understand that all data in Canister is public, just like it is placed on the square.

But I now wonder if the product managers on the Dfinity team think so?

The underlying logic of blockchain technology dictates that Web2 applications cannot simply be built on top of IC. Of course, Web2 can be transformed into a decentralized implementation of Web3 before it can be built on IC. This has a lot of work to do, and it's not that easy.

I think the dfinity team needs to show professionalism and encryption in their outreach and needs to correct those misconceptions.

I would say it's more than just "not that easy" - it's seemingly impossible on **any** blockchain without actually integrating Web2 firewalls and secure networks around each Web3 node. This, in turn, may imply that each Web3 node would have to be dedicated to a single enterprise to keep the private data secure as it is being processed in an unavoidably decrypted manner behind a Web3 boundary node.  A model of "one Web3 node per enterprise" would of course defeat the purpose of a shared blockchain on every IC node. Kubernetes or some other solution might get around this issue of sharing the same node securely by independent enterprises, but that is more Web2 tech to distribute computing power.

Moreover, integrating Web2 firewalls into Web3 likely would create huge cybersecurity inefficiencies vs. Web2. Instead of one firewalled network per enterprise, there would be many replicated networks, across different locations and geographical regions too. Cybersecurity costs for B2B Web3 applications could thus be significantly higher than the already outrageous cybersecurity costs under Web2.

I definitely agree that the DFINITY team needs to correct these misconceptions, or to correct us if we are somehow wrong. The reality for enterprise applications is extremely different from the "World Computer" marketing message of replacing the entire Web2 IT stack.

Why doesn't SEV solve this? Compute a secure key share in your node enclaves, distribute the share, Get a key from the enclave, encrypt your data before you send it to the ic with that key, let the enclaves decrypt and process over the data and return secure results.  My understanding was this was on the road map and I anticipaite being the key to enterprise adoption.

I think not exposing sub net blocks leads to gate keeping and a lot of the defensive positions we see on the IC where groups hand wave open and decentralized but don't ever actual expose their code. Not your code, not your tokens. If we could see the wasms of everything being shipped to the ic in the blocks we could have all kinds of reverse compiler and such that would be a forcing mechanism on people opening up more.  Like on ethereum you'd be able to just grab a wasm and deploy even if you didn't know exactly wat it was doing.

SEV does not solve the privacy and security problem on the blockchain. This is because it has a presupposition that AMD is trusted and that the node providers who install and configure SEV are trusted. But their trustworthiness is based on self-certification, and you can't do public verification.
Let me ask you, can you be sure that the chip used by the node is AMD's published chip? Can you be sure that the firmware the SEV is running has not been modified? Can you be sure that SEV is really installed on the node or not, and if they give you a certified result (e.g. a signature), can you be sure that it must be true?
They're addressing the trustless mechanism with a scheme that requires trust. This is ridiculous. The manager who introduced that scheme should be replaced.
Of course, this may be needed in some scenarios where pseudo-privacy is needed, as SEV raises the cost of leakage and can provide some level of protection for data that has little value.

Without opening up the subnet data, wasm is also public, just a little less public. All nodes in the subnet are aware of this wasm. There are no secrets on IC.

Nodes have the potential to be bad guys. Public users have the potential to be bad guys.
Why do you just trust the nodes and not the public users? Conversely, you can't trust the nodes if you don't trust the public users.

Logically, the two are in conflict. Probably you will choose part of the subnet to be a blockchain and part of the subnet to be another Amazon. This may bring new issues, for example in terms of cross-subnet calls.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-15 04:12:36 UTC | #122

At the consensus level.
If there are 9 colluding bad guys out of 13 nodes, they don't have to pay a penalty, and the other 4 honest nodes need to pay a penalty.
If the data is not public, we can't verify it, we can't detect these bad guys, and they have only benefits and no costs.
Solution: Make the subnet data publicly verifiable.

At the data level.
If you send non-encrypted private data to a node, any node can leak it, he doesn't violate the rules, and he doesn't have to pay a penalty. You can't even prove who leaked the data.
Solution: Dapp should not store any private data on the IC (if you want to do so, you need to encrypt it before sending).

My understanding is that there have been significant gains in chips and algo being able to certify these things.  Not an expert on sev here, but I do know that corporates accept a bit of risk in exchange for profit in all that they do and it "seems" that the current version of dev may have passed that threshold for this use case, especially in a scenario where the node providers are kyc'd and doxed.

Agreed. There is no need for Web3 enthusiasts to get fanatical in their marketing message about replacing the entire Web2 IT stack. Just like we would always want to retain strong security over the centralized private data on our non-replicated phone or non-replicated laptop in a pure Web3 world, there is nothing wrong with retaining some Web2 capabilities on the back end too, like centralized, secure databases behind a firewall. Those capabilities are truly needed for certain use cases (e.g., for enterprise B2B applications and private organizational data shared by a large organization). 

The same logic can be applied to Web1, which has never been completely replaced either and still thrives for many use cases. Web2 just refers to a new Internet architecture that became dominant over Web1. Likewise, Web3 will likely just dominate - but never completely replace - the still dominant Web2 architecture. Web2 and Web3 just represent successive new layers of an evolving original Internet, not upgrades to an obsolete version of the Internet.

That said, it could still be possible for a community or DAO to go 100% Web3 on the IC if they are absolutely determined and don't really care that much about their PII, health records, salary, etc. being publicly accessible to some extent without any firewall security as this data is processed. In a future world with far less concentration of power to abuse private data, and where people are not afraid to be authentic and transparent with strangers, I might even be one of those people too. 

However, until then, the IC should be able to integrate with secure, Web2 centralized databases when absolutely needed. Enterprise-scale database technology has taken decades to develop and fine tune. So why would the IC community want to reinvent this wheel on its blockchain when the data stored on the IC can't even be as secure (from unauthorized access) as it currently is in a Web2 hosting environment like AWS?

That logic can work for B2C applications, but not really for B2B applications like ERP, CRM, BI, etc. where unencrypted organizational data must be processed by an enterprise web application (running on those nodes), which would have no firewall protection in a pure Web3 world. Again, this is not a problem specific to just the IC. No blockchain has a solution to this fundamental contradiction between blockchain transparency and private data.

gregory | 2022-12-15 08:44:57 UTC | #129

Interesting discussions here on the privacy of data stored in canisters, which I agree isn't very private at all. IMO, any data stored by a canister should be considered as publicly available from a security point of view.

And I think that's exactly why the proposal of public subnets makes sense. Currently, we have the worst of both worlds: we can't rely on a subnet to keep its data private, yet we can't verify its correct execution either. By making the blockchain public, at least we can do the latter.

To handle private data on the IC, please have a look at the proposed [threshold key derivation feature](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-key-derivation-privacy-on-the-ic). It can't address all use cases, in particular not those that require canister-side computation on encrypted data (for that you will need advanced and much less efficient techniques like fully homomorphic encryption), but it does open a wide spectrum of B2B applications that simply route pieces of encrypted data that only get decrypted on the user's side.

Your issue seems to be that you don't trust blockchain consensus, and that is the bigger issue.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-15 09:49:25 UTC | #131


This is the basic assumption of the blockchain. You don't have to trust consensus completely, so we need blockchain data to be transparent and everyone can verify it. Because of data transparency, node conspiracy to cheat can be easily detected, and the blockchain asset may go to zero, which is costly. On the balance of interests, nodes usually cannot conspire to cheat, which achieves the effect of "trustworthiness". This is an effect driven by data transparency and interest, not because I trust them. The same is true for the assumptions of economics.
In short: trustless -- balance of interests -- produces a trustworthy effect. This all comes from the fact that blockchain data is transparent.

esquivada | 2022-12-15 13:02:14 UTC | #132

Thank you for your clarification, when you say currently, do you think that in the  future IC will be able to have the best of both worlds?

-------------------------

free | 2022-12-15 10:19:15 UTC | #133

I would like to point out a few things.

To begin with, I agree that strictly from a security point of view, data stored by a canister should be considered public (because a malicious or hacked node operator can, with some effort, expose it). However, there are a few finer points that I believe should be considered:
* It does not automatically follow from the above that all subnets' blockchains **must** be public.
* As Hazel pointed out, for some applications there is value in "pseudo-private" data.
* SEV may provide full privacy. Or just significantly better "pseudo-privacy".
* Data in a subnet's state (i.e. in a canister heap/stable memory) may be removed. It may not be removed from a blockchain. Again, some applications may be perfectly happy with that level of privacy.

Second, as long as at least one honest replica is present on a subnet, it is possible to detect even a malicious supermajority. An honest node would diverge from a malicious majority. DFINITY takes state divergence (one node diverging from the rest of the subnet) very seriously (mostly in order to detect non-determinism bugs). To my knowledge, we have investigated all such occurrences since Genesis. There is no reason to believe that, once a more decentralized operations model is set up (where it's not only DFINITY keeping an eye on replica operation), one cannot continue the same approach. (FWIW, replica divergence is very rare. It only happened a handful of times since Genesis. And it was always determined to be due to bugs, that were then immediately fixed.)

Third, applications that require high tamper resistance would also be deployed on subnets with higher replication. Even if replica divergence was not investigated, you would need to get significantly more than 9 (likely mostly independent) entities to collude in order to turn such a subnet malicious. And they would need to very closely synchronize their attack in order to prevent the subnet from stalling. Not impossible, just more defense in depth.

Fourth, IC blocks are usually small (particularly when not much update traffic is going on), but they can be up to 4 MB (and we are considering ways of making that "up to 4 MB of message hashes; with message payloads on the side"). Per second. Per subnet. Meaning that publicly exposing subnet blockchains is by far not the same as retaining all of them forever (as is e.g. the case with Bitcoin or Ethereum). And one of the reasons why node hardware is standardized is that, at full tilt, you need serious CPU; memory/storage capacity and throughput; and network bandwidth; in order to keep up with a subnet. At which point, what exactly is the difference between having a subnet's last N blocks and adding one more replica to the subnet? (A replica that doesn't even need to take part in the consensus algorithm in order to verify correctness. And, obviously, a replica that you trust more than the existing ones.)

Edit: Fifth, what exactly would be the difference between the IC and some distributed storage network (say, IPFS) if all one expects from canisters is to store encrypted data and hand it back to clients on request?

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-15 10:25:32 UTC | #134

You can't throw away the most valuable things of blockchain just to be "different".
The biggest difference between WEB2 and WEB3 is that
WEB2: Users must trust the product/service provider to use the product.
WEB3: Users can use the product even if they don't trust the product/service provider.

If I'm reading this correctly, you seem to be saying that for you, IPFS provides all that you expect from Web3. Then why not stick with IPFS?

I'm not referring specifically to IPFS. i'm referring to the most valuable thing about the blockchain.
The choosing of IC was a trade-off, but based on an assumption that IC will have open data subnets later. If IC never opens up the subnet data, we will leave.

Ability to compute the data on chain using the same tech stack would be one, but generally speaking if the only difference between IPFS and ICP is the pseudo privacy, then IC value proposition should be reconsidered.

-------------------------

free | 2022-12-15 12:34:11 UTC | #138

I was not arguing that there is no value in opening up subnet blockchains. I was also (by far) not arguing that pseudo-privacy is the only value proposition of the IC.

I was merely arguing against a few specific points that were raised in this thread. Namely:
* The need for every single subnet to publish their blocks (and the argument that there is no value in subnets whose blockchains are pseudo-private).
* The impossibility of detecting a malicious supermajority in the absence of a public blockchain.
* It being easy to hijack a subnet that is set up to be highly tamper resistant.
* The expectation that simply publishing most subnets' blockchains is somehow a magic bullet and will automatically give you the same properties that Bitcoin and Ethereum do (hint: there is a good reason why Ethereum transactions and storage are as expensive as they are).
* Dumbing down the IC to the point where all it does is store data encrypted by end users.

There is a lot more to the IC (and Web3) than verifiability by means of a public blockchain that is persisted forever (scalability, cost, efficiency, on-chain governance, including protocol evolution; variety; decentralization; direct integration with Web2 and other blockchains; and so on, and so forth). If all you need is a persisted public blockchain plus scripting, then there are literally tens if not hundreds of Ethereum copycat networks. And there is of course Ethereum.

Again, still not arguing against subnets with public blockchains (and particularly the NNS subnet). Only against claims that blockchains and blockchain networks cannot possibly be useful outside of the very narrow spectrum where virtually all other public blockchains in existence are fighting it out.

Question here, how does Dfinity prove that they are sure about the super majority of the nodes are not cheating without revealing their data? Through Zero Knowledge? I haven’t seen much talking  with it. I know Dfinity can monitor it but to just to make sure Dfinity is a main contributor to IC not a corporate and IC is a public blockchain. The due diligence doesn’t convince me

Second, as long as at least one honest replica is present on a subnet, it is possible to detect even a malicious supermajority. An honest node would diverge from a malicious majority. [..] To my knowledge, we have investigated all such occurrences since Genesis. [..] And it was always determined to be due to bugs, that were then immediately fixed.
[/quote]

The above is a very good indication that either no nodes are malicious or every single node is malicious.

Since only DFINITY currently has access to the raw metrics (some aggregated metrics are publicly available via the public dashboard API), the above is not exactly a proof. But there is no technical barrier to opening up the metrics. Or to setting up a more decentralized operations model, where not only DFINITY would have access to metrics, logs and debugging. As most everything else, it merely requires a lot of work.

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-15 14:54:27 UTC | #141

So we basically have to fully TRUST Dfinity to ensure that nodes are not malfunctional. Hope that part can be solved soon…..

Yes, I too hope that every single feature that the community requests can be "solved soon".

And expect to be laughed at throughout for attempting to build something more complex than a replicated state machine backed by a public blockchain.

At which point, what exactly is the difference between having a subnet’s last N blocks and adding one more replica to the subnet? (A replica that doesn’t even need to take part in the consensus algorithm in order to verify correctness. And, obviously, a replica that you trust more than the existing ones.)

It is definitely not out of question. I don't know whether it is in anyone's actual future plans.

Such replicas would be useful both as independent validators and as additional query handlers, to take load off of replicas that participate in consensus. So they would clearly be useful to have.

I think your points are awesome and I pretty much agree with @bitbruce's position.

I think even @bitbruce is ok that we're on the path to somewhere awesome, but we've all got to agree on the general vector of where we are going and I don't think anyone here is arguing that we should never have public subnets. I assume that having some public subnets would meet @bitbruce's criteria and that he might be inclined to have the apps that he support not trust private subnets as a security assumption. I would consider that to be a cogent approach depending on your risk profile.

At one point we had a fairly functioning plug in that would give you a red, yellow, green signal if the canister you were interacting with was 1. Open Sourced, 2. Verifable by Cover(A psycadelic thing that I guess is going away now).  I could see something like that for if your sub net was public or not.

This is what I mainly disagree with, I don't think all subnets being public would in any way dumb down the IC, quite the opposite in fact. Some might see pseudo-privacy as a feature but imo it's a bad practice to rely on it.
I doubt any serious enterprise would be fine with it, especially considering it's hard if not impossible to track down the leaker and even if it were, legal consequences are dubious and as a user I wouldn't provide sensitive data to a service whose security guarantees are based on the hope a bad provider never gets into their subnet. 

Plus as @skilesare said permissionless boundary nodes are on Dfinity roadmap as part of the decentralization process, especially in relation to canister censorship and that would get rid of the current psuedo privacy anyway.

rossberg | 2022-12-15 17:47:15 UTC | #150

Some folks in this discussion seem to think of privacy as a binary property: you either have it or don't. From a practical perspective, that's a totally bogus world view.

In reality, privacy, like security, is a spectrum. You can only increase or decrease the probability and cost of successful attacks. It all comes down to a tradeoff and a game of economics: you want to make attacks *costly enough*. There is no 100% protection.

Neither does reality enable such a thing as trustless computing. You have to trust your own hardware, its vendor, and the entire supply chain, much of which is coming from countries with questionable laws. Contemporary hardware has plenty of back doors, and the amount of phoning home that it can do (and does) before it even starts booting the OS is mind-boggling. The times where we were in full control of our own machines have passed at least 20 years ago. And obviously, blockchains don't work with air gaps.

So some of the absolutist arguments in this thread just sound silly to me, especially when they argue against trusting node hardware vendors but completely ignore the hardware problem right in front of them.

Well said, @rossberg. This is definitely a good thought to keep in mind. The technical term for such an absolutist position would be a "false dichotomy fallacy". I still don't think the IC is anywhere near being ready for enterprise B2B applications in terms of privacy and database capabilities, but it doesn't necessarily have to be in order to still be very successful.

[/quote]

Yes, it's an economic concept. The effect of any protection comes from the fact that the cost of his attack is greater than the benefit.

There are two aspects of security.

(1) data privacy security. One path is that it relies on cryptographic encryption and does not rely on any hardware or node provider. The benefit of this approach is that it is secure enough, the drawback is that it limits the development of Dapp, which must be massively refactored. The other path is that it relies on hardware and node provider security measures, like AWS. the benefit of this approach is that it protects low-value data (because the cost of attack is higher than the benefit), but in the face of high-value data, hardware and node providers still have many paths to steal data because the benefit is much greater than the cost of attack. btc and ETH have chosen the former, and IC is choosing the latter, depending on which application scenarios take precedence.

(2) Consensus layer security. Security relies on cryptographic verification and consensus mechanisms, which rely heavily on the inability of nodes to form a conspiracy to cheat, a logic that also stems from the assumption that the costs of attack outweigh the benefits, not that we really trust them. However, this assumption may break down in the face of high-value events, and nodes may conspire to cheat in the face of benefits. So many blockchains have some practices that increase the cost of cheating: a) Allowing anyone to be able to create nodes, which comes at the expense of efficiency. IC has shrunk this practice for the sake of efficiency. b) Blockchain data is made public so that everyone can verify it, complicity in cheating can be detected quickly, and all users can take steps to protect themselves and make cheaters pay, which inadvertently raises the cost of attack significantly. This inadvertently increases the cost of attack significantly and creates a deterrent for potential cheaters. If blockchain data is not publicly available, cheaters are likely to go undetected, or be detected when it is too late. The vast majority of blockchains have adopted this measure, and IC is currently hesitant to do so for the sake of pseudo-privacy, although there are plans to open it up.

Again, to make my point.
1) I think most of the subnet data being open is a priority.
2) I don't object to a small portion of the subnets still taking the current non-open measures, because there are indeed some applications that have this need, such as putting some unimportant files. I don't think this direction will be mainstream. But please make good open guidelines, to let the developer know what he is doing, he can't treat canister as his own server.

Not sure what you meant by "choosing the latter, depending on which application scenarios take precedence", but it could be exactly what I was arguing for (and the IC is aiming for): instead of enforcing one extreme, the IC allows for a wide spectrum, not merely the binary choice you present:
* you can publish and persist blocks forever, as will likely be the case with the NNS;
* you can publish and persist the last N blocks, allowing anyone to run independent replicas that verify correctness; and
* you can keep blocks and replica state more or less private (up to and including allowing someone to run a subnet exclusively on their own nodes; or on nodes with specific hardware features).

And everything in-between. On the IC, as opposed to BTC and ETH, there is zero need to go full-on religious fundamentalist on this particular choice.

This very dynamic applies to traditional blockchains. How exactly is it more difficult for a couple of mining pools to agree to cheat than it would be for 9 or more (mostly independent) parties? Why do you keep assuming that simply because some network has thousands of validator nodes, this must mean thousands of independent parties? The very nature of such networks makes economies of scale the way to go: node operator overhead is huge if one can only afford to run a couple of validators; it is negligible if you are adding N more validators to an already running pool of thousands of servers you own.

Again, I'm not sure what you mean by "IC has shrunk this practice", but the truth is that the only reason why you cannot run your own replica on the side, as a validator, is that it requires work to implement and that work has not been done yet. This very thread discusses what priority should be assigned to that work. And AFAICT not a single comment has argued for keeping all subnets' blockchains private. Yet, there is a vocal minority that acts as if this were so and as if no one but them understands the benefits of a public blockchain.

Honest question: what draws you to the IC when, as you point out, ETH (and the vast majority of other networks) do exactly what you see as necessary? If it is perchance the scalability and the very low costs of operating a canister? If so, that directly contradicts verifiability via publishing and persisting the blockchain forever, exactly because the latter is so insanely expensive.

You keep going back to this strawman. No, it is not "for the sake of pseudo-privacy", it's (i) for the sake of scalability and cost (in the case of persisting blocks forever); and (ii) because no one has had the time to build this in (in the case of independent nodes). With the minute increase in privacy as a side-effect. And instead of finally agreeing that publishing blocks in some form or other is a high priority feature and moving forward with an implementation, here we are waging holy war over how it constitutes the only reasonable way of using a blockchain and trying to enforce it onto "most subnets".

It could be that I'm reading too much into this and you are just referring to the use of [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) as a way to provide data privacy on a public network while allowing a dapp to do more than serve as glorified storage. If so, I highly doubt that this is currently used much, if at all, on any network. And there is absolutely nothing preventing you from using it on the IC, if you so choose. It is (to the extent that you can do cryptography on-chain) not a binary choice that the network enforces on you.

Another way of reading this (based on "btc and ETH have chosen the former, and IC is choosing the latter") is that you believe (or make yet another strawman argument) that the actual IC protocol "relies on hardware and node provider security measures" as opposed to strong cryptography for its correctness.

Regardless, whether referring to homomorphic encryption; or relying on individual node providers for protocol correctness and safety; there are no two paths here. BTC and ETH have not chosen homomorphic encryption. And the IC protocol does not rely on node providers for its correctness.

It is simply a case of the IC as currently deployed (due to choices related to efficiency and scalability; and not yet implemented features; not technical or political limitations) offering by default a modicum of privacy to canisters, in that e.g. some random person without significant technical or financial backing cannot just go ahead and read a message that you posted to some private DSCVR group.

This thread discusses giving up that modicum of privacy on specific subnets for the possibility (not guarantee) of significantly stronger correctness checks.

Edit: "significantly stronger correctness checks" from the point of view of any one entity, not necessarily from the point of view of the protocol / community at large. There is zero improvement *to me* if *you* run an independent node that validates one subnet's blockchain vs. the NNS deciding to add one more replica to said subnet.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-16 10:53:58 UTC | #155

I express my opinion and you can stick to yours. You will also read other people's opinions.

I am not emphasizing binary choices, but talking about having to make trade-offs when some options face conflicts.
Regarding blockchains like BTC, ETH, IPFS, IC, they are all great projects and all unique in their own way. It is important to know that the ecology of BTC and ETH still leads the crypto world, and the new generation of projects still faces challenges and struggles, which is the reason why people have the opportunity to chat in this forum.
The reason why some people are expressing their views here is to make IC better, not to linguistically praise how good it is.
Many of IC's innovations have come at a partial cost, which needs to be weighed against the trade-offs. For example, IC gave up atomicity and reduced security to get higher performance and efficiency, as well as scalability. But some changes will send IC down a different path, and I'm worried it's losing too many blockchain features to cater to what would otherwise be web2 needs. I think more than one person has said something similar.
I'm not here to deny it, I'm here to push it. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here talking.

-------------------------

I'm very much not saying you should not be expressing your opinions. Or that everything that you are proposing is wrong or worthless. Just that taking absolutist approaches to anything just because that's how everyone else has done it; and ignoring alternate approaches and different needs; will not lead to strictly better security or privacy.

In particular and as an example, as long as I personally am not running an independent node that verifies a subnet's blockchain in real time; or even if I do but there are parts of the replica stack that I'm not intimately familiar with; I get fewer benefits from you (claiming to) run an independent node as opposed to the NNS adding one more node to the subnet (and my having access to said node's metrics). You running an independent node is better for you, not necessarily better for me.

As you say, there are trade-offs to be made. So you should be free to run your own validator node, if that gives you stronger confidence in (but not a guarantee of) a subnet's honesty. And there's no good reason for me to prevent that. But if I don't intend to run a node validating every subnet that I interact with; and instead value more my boss not being able on a whim to read my ranting behind his back; you should also not be forcing your constraints ("most of the subnet data being open") on me.

That being said, I do take issue with blanket statements such as "IC [...] reduced security to get higher performance and efficiency"; "If blockchain data is not publicly available, cheaters are likely to go undetected"; "Dapp should not store any private data on the IC" (while claiming that you understand that privacy is a continuum, not a binary state); or the false dichotomy between BTC and ETH's (vague) "choice" on the one hand and the IC's on the other. None of the above adds anything useful to your argument.

I am not looking at other blockchain projects with contempt. They made their choices (either for technical reasons; or simply because they exist from long before the IC was even conceived and that was the state of the art at the time) and they have their trade-offs. Usually, favoring huge replication as a way to achieve tamper resistance over cost or scalability. Hence, they are very useful for some applications, but not so much for others.

What I do have a strong opposition to is the claim that following closely in their footsteps is the only way in which the IC could be useful as anything more than an AWS clone.

You think the security of a 9 node IC subnet is about the same as a blockchain with thousands of nodes, you also think the security of non-public blockchain data is comparable to the security of public data, and think IC has the ability to protect private data for most applications. That's the funniest joke I've ever heard.
If this foundational argument of yours holds true, then all of your points above are true. 

Do you remember the BTC-BCH fork? Several large mining pools could really do whatever they wanted if there were no public nodes, but numerous public nodes prevented this from happening and BTC went on to become mainstream. This proves the value of public nodes, even if they don't participate in consensus.

Yes, a lot of people are stupid, including me, and don't understand the great things you guys do. Some even claim that IC is not a blockchain, that many mature application scenarios don't want to come in, that some IC developers are leaving, and that it's these people who are too stale to see the great things IC is doing.

That's not what I meant. Is the ETH solution the only option for open nodes?
In terms of open nodes, how to make the technology viable is something the dfinity team needs to consider. If I understand correctly, he is now happy with the security and transparency of IC, which he thinks is what most developers want.

I recognize the dfinity team's statement that there are plans to do this, starting with NNS. We are arguing about the priority of this and the question of how to make IC a real blockchain.

I'm not being arbitrary, and I'm in favor of giving developers a choice.

But do developers have a choice now? Do you hear the prioritization of this thing?

If he really wants to give developers a choice, he should talk more about technically feasible solutions, more about when the first open subnets will appear. Instead of arguing here.

There are enough issues to talk about, such as how to solve the public node synchronization problem, whether to use more expensive cycles charges, and whether to focus on the low-storage subnets easier to achieve public synchronization.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-12-17 06:21:34 UTC | #167

FWIW, this is going to be my last comment on this thread. As @singularity points out, this is turning into an ego war, and that was by far not my intention. I was merely trying to bring some context to a couple of points where I thought the argument (or unquestioned assumption) was too one sided (no way to detect a malicious majority; no use for pseudo-private subnets; public blockchains as an unqualified improvement; etc.).

You think the security of a 9 node IC subnet is about the same as a blockchain with thousands of nodes
[/quote]

I never said anything about a subnet with 9 nodes, but yes, I do believe that the security of an IC subnet set up with that specific intent (e.g. the NNS or Bitcoin subnets; maybe with a published blockchain; maybe with some other forms of defense-in-depth) is the same or better as the security of a blockchain with thousands of nodes. One relies on deterministically picking (very likely) independent nodes, controlled by publicly identified operators; the other relies on it being expensive to mount [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). Thing is (as already stated) that in Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake networks, the incentive structure encourages economies of scale (the more nodes you run, the higher your profit margin). So, whether you like it or not, the equilibrium of such networks tends towards centralization. And away from security.

Also, as soon as you have more than one single blockchain that everyone validates (with all the limitations that come along) the aim of having "thousands of nodes" validating every single side-chain is a pipe dream. Merely publishing one more blockchain does not automatically summon into existence thousands of nodes to validate it. So even if the above wasn't true (which I believe it is), you cannot possibly apply the "security via thousands of anonymous nodes" strategy to anything that you expect to scale beyond plain smart contracts for use by a tiny minority.

you also think the security of non-public blockchain data is comparable to the security of public data,
[/quote]

Comparable, maybe. Equivalent, no. Regardless, my point was that there is significant value in it, not that it is necessarily comparable. Different applications have different security requirements. Just as security is not binary, it is also not one-dimensional: even if you understood every single aspect of two system's security models, it would be foolish to claim that one is categorically more secure than the other in all respects. (One example I gave was my being able to talk behind my boss' back without him being able to trivially find out about it. That, to me and many others, is security.)

But, for the sake of argument, as @rossberg already pointed out, even given a public blockchain you must rely on your hardware and node software (and their supply chains) to do what you expect them to do. And, for the vast majority of people operating a blockchain node, even just understanding that complexity, much less being able to verify its correctness, is way out of reach. The fact that I bought a desktop machine; downloaded some software off the internet; and said software tells me everything is just fine when I run it; is nowhere close to a guarantee of anything. So why is it such a stretch to rely on the correctness of some protocol and a network deployment vetted by a large community (some of whom are clearly more knowledgeable than me about software, hardware and supply chains) without having the software run on the machine under my desk?

To my current understanding (and I'm not merely overstating the case) it is virtually impossible to hijack even a 13-node subnet undetected without controlling every single one of the 13 nodes. Given better public checks and balances (e.g. publicly available metrics and logs signed by each replica), anyone could get the same level of confidence that I, as a DFINITY insider, have now.

you [...] think IC has the ability to protect private data for most applications. That’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard.
[/quote]

I never claimed that. On the contrary, I stated:

[quote="free, post:133, topic:16503"]
strictly from a security point of view, data stored by a canister should be considered public (because a malicious or hacked node operator can, with some effort, expose it)
[/quote]

Please stop putting words into my mouth.

[quote="bitbruce, post:161, topic:16503"]
If this foundational argument of yours holds true, then all of your points above are true.
[/quote]

Thank you.

So when is the public subnet coming

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-17 11:07:29 UTC | #170

We well understood that the reasons for private subnets. But we demand at least NNS and SNS should be public.

Thank you for your great explanations, of course it is clear that we are in the best hands.

Would you be able to expand on this a little more as I believe this is a little understood area about the IC? What about the IC network's setup/security/monitoring makes it near impossible to hijack a 13-node subnet even if the node providers are colluding or nodes being hacked?

With the key word there being "undetected". Of course you can hijack a subnet if you control a supermajority (two thirds plus one) of the nodes. But as long as at least one honest node is still part of the subnet, it will report having diverged from the rest of the subnet (something that can only happen if there is a determinism bug in the replica; or the subnet has become malicious). Meaning that, as long as replica divergence continues being taken seriously, the divergence will be detected and investigated.

Have a look at this community conversation about data confidentiality: https://youtu.be/PneRzDmf_Xw?t=1529

We also have example dApps that implement this design: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/samples/encrypted-notes/

Hearing this gives me a lot of confidence in the IC Lighthouse team. ICP devs need to do a lot more to prove that their canister does what it says it does. I know cover protocol were trying to do this.. we need quick and easy ways for the public to check a canister === public code. 

Personally I think devs should be able to expose their code in a way which can be viewed on the internet computer dashboard. If people can't verify the 'blocks' they should at least be able to verify the code that sent them.

If the newly released TFHE-rs: pure Rust implementation "could link to the Rust structs," would that mean the backend container would only provide data to be made public that was e2ee?
