Hi everybody! We are starting this thread to discuss a new idea: public subnets.

Currently, the state of a subnet and all subnet inputs (like ingress or cross-net messages) are not exposed to the public. While it's not always desirable that an application state can be freely inspected by the public, it provides advantages as well. For example, opening the underlying subnet blockchain and its replicated state would allow anybody to build blockchain explorers similar to Etherscan, providing all the technical information about block contents together with the cryptographic signatures, so that anybody can cryptographically verify all state transitions of such a public subnet.

We could consider introducing a new subnet type (or “predicate”) that says whether the subnet is public or not and leave the choice to canister developers if they want to deploy their canisters to such a public subnet. E.g. DeFi and NFT dapps could benefit from running on public subnets, as it would make their internal ledgers completely transparent and auditable.

This idea is clearly not fully baked yet, but we’d be very happy to discuss this on the forum. Some initial questions that we’d like to discuss:

1. Do you think introducing the notion of public subnets is a valuable addition to the Internet Computer?
2. Do you think the NNS subnet ([tbd26](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe)) should be a public subnet? (This would make the state of all neurons public, including the controller principal and the accrued maturity.)
3. How would you want this to work? What would you want to do with the state of public subnets?

Looking forward to the discussion! @christian, @bjoern and I will try to participate in the discussion from DFINITY’s side.

Within an era in which the defiance is becoming massive – given what is happening in the crypto ecosystem – such an idea is great : the more people know they can inspect, the better is.

I can see many developers valuing privacy, and explicitly choosing private subnets for that reason.

Similarly, I can see value in being able to view all of the blocks for a subnet. And I think some developers would pick public subnets specifically for this reason: transparency, trust, openness, etc.

No well-thought-out opinion about the NNS subnet. I can see arguments for both ways.

In Toniq products, I could see us allowing users to choose where to deploy their canisters. On the one hand, you can have privacy, passwords, secure data. On the other hand you can have openness, transparency, verifiability (perhaps). 

Overall feels interesting.

Mr_Burkes | 2022-11-11 20:26:36 UTC | #4

Why not make all subnet inputs/outputs public? What's the downside?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-11-11 20:45:56 UTC | #5

They should all be public.  I think we're a ways from that(we need AMD-SEV or other multiparty compute for private data storage), but as long as we have private subnets we'll keep having the pull and financial incentive to obscure the things that, when visible, demand integrity, fair dealing, and the public good.

Having the option would be amazing.  Convincing everyone to pay attention to the choices they are making and where they are allowing their assets to flow is a harder challenge.  Maybe something like fiduciary subnets would be good to consider here? If it isn't public then certain assets can be flagged as not allowed to flow there and not allowed to have access to features like t-ecdsa that require high levels of trust.

Motokoder | 2022-11-11 21:56:25 UTC | #8

Public subnets would be great as long as some data can be encrypted. File drives for example.

If we'll have aggregators for the internal DeFi/NFT ledgers, then we'll also need a standard for those data structures.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-11-11 22:53:45 UTC | #9

Lack of privacy. I think having the flexibility of making everything inspectable or not would be a strength for the internet computer.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2022-11-11 23:02:11 UTC | #10

Opaque centralized custodial financial institutions like FTX destroyed whatever trust was remaining in the crypto space. Going forward the crypto ecosystem will rightfully place even greater importance on Transparency and Auditability for any on-chain financial services.

It's highly unlikely DeFi on the IC would flourish without complete auditability and transparency of canisters running DeFi applications on the IC. If public subnets will provide this transparency necessary for application code to be verified publicly than I think it is important for the success of DeFI on the IC.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-11-11 23:11:14 UTC | #11

It's a no brainer for DeFi and should be a high priority. Would love to keep the capability of doing both public and private subnets. Who knows, maybe in the future we'll see all kind of subnets such as GPU, storage, AI and so on.

I don't think you have to have public subnets to verify DeFi on the IC. On a private subnet the application itself can expose transactions and proofs.

If we would want to enable anybody to recompute and fully validate all computation, then even with AMD SEV we would not get any confidentiality of data. AMD SEV would still help improve the integrity of course.

I see it the same way as @Sormarler:  many software applications today don't want all of the data to be public. If we would want a large fraction of the software of the world to run on the IC, we have to take that into consideration, I think strictly enforcing that everything be public would be limiting the use cases of the IC.

No performance impact. I think the only tradeoff is privacy vs transparency and verifiability.

Yes! This would be great to have!

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-11-12 18:33:08 UTC | #15

I'm not sure a binary public or private is the best solution. I believe it's preferable to be able to customize at a granular level which components on an application and its surrounding stack are private and which are public.

For example, a finance application may want some information to be public, for example a decentralized exchange that can prove its solvency. But that same decentralized exchange may want to keep individual balances completely private, but maybe organization balances (like companies, government entities, etc) public.

A course public/private subnet choice I don't believe to be ideal for every use case, but I can see benefits.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-11-12 19:23:33 UTC | #16

It would be helpful if you could link to the Rust structs in the IC codebase containing the data that would be made public, namely the subnet state. I'd like to take a look at the actual fields that would be made public.

Isn’t the implication that there is private data about of a handwave? A node provider could capture and publish this info at any time. Unless the inputs are encrypted you’d see all the data in the transaction logs.

Why couldn't we simply encrypt everything on a public subnet to preserve privacy?

True, but there's value in having that by default. You don't need yet another level of standardization in the ecosystem to make use of this data. I think it would be a huge benefit if services like [Dune](https://dune.com/) and [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/) would be able to integrate (at least parts of) the IC.

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-11-13 16:59:53 UTC | #20

I think having the option is good. Transparency and privacy are both import important.

I can see how public subnets could simplify things for users but it could also create misunderstandings. For example; a canister on a public subnet may encrypt its data, and a canister on a private subnet may not.

If the NNS subnet were to become a public subnet, does that raise any concerns about privacy or change things significantly for people who have already locked up their ICP?

There’s been feedback on other proposed ideas that involve changes being made after people have already committed, confidence for people doing that in the future, etc.

The really cool thing about public subnets is the complete verifiability for anybody. This is very difficult to achieve when keeping some data hidden, so I don't see a practical way to get both the complete verifiability AND have the option to keep some data private. I don't think some ZKP approach is feasible for how much the IC can process.

I don't have a complete set of links, and I'm actually hoping to do some refactoring in the consensus types, but things like https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/types/types/src/consensus.rs#L220 and https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/replicated_state/src/replicated_state.rs#L315.

You're right, but the question is more about verifiability. If we want the user to fully verify the blockchain and resulting replicated state, then the user needs to have access to this state. We could perhaps think of some way that if a user wants to verify the state it can only do so using an AMD SEV machine in an attempt to keep the state private, but I feel like that's a pretty big sacrifice to verifiability.

How would that work exactly? Encrypt under which key? And if we give users only encrypted data that they can't decrypt, they can't actually verify the computation anymore right?

I wouldn’t say I personally have concerns about it but yes, this was in response to @Manu‘s question about potentially changing the NNS from private to public.

I imagine the average NNS user would want to understand what a change like that means for their privacy.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-11-14 17:51:46 UTC | #30

Ok makes sense. But anyway I think it makes sense to discuss these things in two steps. I sense a lot of positive sentiment for having (at least some) public subnets. So that's already good. And the NNS question probably has to be discussed in a broader context and with more explanation of the implications.

Hey everyone, quick update on that topic.

We discussed this initiative internally again and decided to not make it a priority for now given that the discussion didn't reveal any immediate demand or interest for that feature from the side of the community.

To be clear, @christian @bjoern and I started this topic because we actually think it would be a cool feature. Since there are many different things to work on, we try to listen to the community and pick the features that are most requested. Given the mixed feedback in this topic we had the impression that this is not a feature that the entire community is eagerly waiting for, and should therefore not get the top priority.

If you think there are many people actually requesting this, please let them voice it here on the forum, or you can consider submitting a motion proposal. I personally think it would be cool to make at least the NNS subnet a public blockchain that everybody can verify, so I would vote in favor.

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-09 17:10:15 UTC | #38

I personally think this is crucial, especially for DEFI applications. Otherwise, it would be hard to for the public to trust. For social applications, it's not a big deal. But for the DEFI applications, we can then build the blockchain explorer to index the data. All statistic would be hard to implement without public subnets

My anecdotal experience based on skimming through the forums and private chats makes me believe public subnets have widespread approval, a related motion proposal would almost certainly be approved, main point of contention would be whether to make NNS public or not and how the feature would be exactly implemented.

What we need to know to decide whether it should be a priority or not is having more details on how long it would take to implement and what would be pushed over as a result.

This is an important topic, and it was one of the factors in Dapps' decision to choose ic blockchain.

The ICLighthouse team chose the IC blockchain on the premise that the node data of the IC subnet would be open in one form or another at a later date. 
If this is our error in judgment and IC will never open the subnet data, we end up having to abandon the project at a tragic cost. Because we have a most fundamental value: the project has to be built on a blockchain, not on another Amazon.

Here are my views.

1. The basic essentials of blockchain are cryptography-based and publicly verifiable, because the prerequisite assumption condition here is that we are in an untrustworthy environment and we need trustless mechanisms. "Publicly verifiable" requires blockchain data to be public in a certain dimension, so that anyone can easily verify it.

2. Privacy protection and data openness do not absolutely conflict, and this cannot be a reason for not disclosing data. I acknowledge that there are some specific subnets that do have a need for non-disclosure of data (e.g. the subnet where II canister is located).

3. there is no logical technical barrier. If there is, there are many ways to solve it, such as edge nodes establishing layer 2 protocols.

4. Dfinity's decision on this topic, and prioritization, can reflect the positioning and philosophy of the IC project. It is about where the ecology will eventually go.

[/quote]

If you don't think it's necessary, then Apple's products, Microsoft's products, Amazon's products, a lot of their data is self-verifiable. Many of their products are also distributed architectures and have consensus mechanisms. So, why do we need an IC?
Don't you feel it? IC is moving further and further away from the crypto industry, and the signs are dangerous. Investors thought dfinity was a crypto project to give it such a high valuation and provide them with money to burn. I can't comment on dfinity's strategic goals, but I understand that in recent years the only resources that will keep dfinity going will be from the crypto industry. In any case, dfinity has to keep itself and its ecosystem alive first.

There are several reasons why this is necessary, and I've stated them above. If you don't think it's necessary, have you thought about why? Where does the basis for the decision come from?
In common sense, Crypto projects are data-transparent by default. If you feel that the IC project is not necessary to open data, then you need good reasons to explain. Rather than asking "why is it necessary".

If you don't agree with me, then that's fine. whether IC can open a few subnets with open and verifiable data (providing interfaces and SDKs) and you see how the market will choose is an interesting phenomenon and I want to know the answer.

@christian

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-10 05:50:22 UTC | #43

Absolutely makes sense. Why a Dex would choose IC over AWS? Technically Cex data are now partially open including trades and transfer. But could we trust them? No! Because not all of their data are transparent. Defi needs to be FULLLY transparent  in order for the public to trust and the community could build ecosystems around the DEX. Remember any crypto project is NOT by single entity. Like Uniswap, communities could build Inch, flash loan. Now, if Uniswap’s data is not public. What would happen?

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-12-10 06:10:44 UTC | #44

It looks like there are tons of support for this feature reading the comments. How did the foundation reach the conclusion that there wasn't? Are you guys reaching out to developers personally and ask them or is it just on the forum? Please reconsider this.

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-10 06:17:40 UTC | #45

Besides that, Let’s look at IC dashboard, how do we verify the TPS is real, how do we know the block finalization is real. We don’t even know the block height!

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-12-10 06:43:49 UTC | #46

I agree that IC dapps should be able to be publicly verifiable. I am asking is there a way to make IC dapps publicly verifiable that are on a private subnet? Like having the dapp itself publicly publish it's own transaction histories and cryptographic proofs.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-10 08:56:38 UTC | #47

There is no 100% secure system in this world (including blockchain), and open and verifiable data the last line of defense to protect users. If the blockchain consensus is wrong or nodes conspire to cheat, it can be discovered by the user, who can then leave it and be spared from continuing to be harmed by it.
If ic doesn't open up the data, how can the user verify it? Should he trust the ic core code? Should he trust the programmer who developed it? Should he trust the dfinity foundation? Should he trust the nodes? Should he trust the "secure hardware" on the node that he does not see?

If the data is not publicly verifiable, you will eventually come to the conclusion that ic is not trusted.

It is not that a system built using cryptography is a blockchain system. It is a sociological concept, similar to, any society with opaque governance (even with electoral mechanisms) is not a democratic society. I don't consider ic a blockchain system if there is no open verifiable data.

If you agree with me to some extent on the above, then it is time to make a change.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-12-10 14:52:01 UTC | #48

Unless a user runs a node themselves they won't be able to tell IC data is 100% correct anyway. A majority of dishonest nodes could sign invalid blocks and there would be no way for any users (that don't run a node) to detect that.

-------------------------

A9icp | 2022-12-13 03:46:32 UTC | #51

Thank you for the perspective you provided, it finally dawned on me, and I suddenly understood the core reason why IC’s DEFI can’t be done. I remember that there was a public discussion before, and a developer said a similar point of view. The logic is I didn’t understand this one at the time, but now I suddenly understand it. Indeed, if it doesn’t change, it’s impossible for DeFi to become bigger on ic

-------------------------

A9icp | 2022-12-13 03:47:08 UTC | #52

And it gave me a deep understanding of why IC’s so-called full-stack on-chain is far less attractive than asset on-chain on ETH plus DAPP code open source

-------------------------

A9icp | 2022-12-13 03:47:58 UTC | #53

In the past, I always understood it as a competition between two routes. Looking back now, I still don’t understand it deeply enough. For public chains, it is obvious that open source verifiable is more vital

And from these core discussions, I began to understand what **@shaoan** said before that the foundation lacks encryption development experience and encryption spirit, which is indeed the case

-------------------------

A9icp | 2022-12-13 03:55:55 UTC | #54

Regarding this point, it should have been mentioned repeatedly by developers as early as a year and a half ago. , after the DEFI on the IC still has no substantive changes, most people in the community still don’t understand the core logic

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-13 08:54:08 UTC | #55

Based on the comment history of this thread, would this be defined as "controversial"? 
Moving a proposal is a better way to go, but with the large number of ICPs held by the foundation, the decision still rests with them. So Dfinity can't avoid this issue, Dfinity team need to take a stand and justify it.

This topic is more important and urgent than BTC integration and ETH integration. It is about whether ckBTC and ckETH assets are accepted by the crypto ecology once they enter the IC network. Don't think you have a chainkey to prove it is safe, why should they trust you (assets need trustless environment, They can't trust a technology or institution that they can't verify.)?

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-12-13 10:21:14 UTC | #56

Just to make sure I understand you right. Do you believe all subnets need to be public or just the ones that are running  DEFI applications?

Great, glad we agree that moving forward with a proposal is a reasonable way to make progress. Yes, DFINITY has a lot of voting power, although not a majority (currently 22.6%). I don't think DFINITY is "avoiding the issue", this forum thread was meant to ask the community for input. I'm pretty sure DFINITY is in favor of opening at least the NNS as a first step.

That will lead to the discussion of DEFI subnet (with open block data) somewhere.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-13 14:53:20 UTC | #60

Yes. Action can be started by opening certain subnets. This will allow for real feedback data as well as solving new problems faced. More benefits include giving developers in the IC ecosystem options and more possibilities for IC ecosystem development.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2022-12-13 15:05:57 UTC | #61

I think it starts with opening up some of the subnets. Ultimately one needs to seek maximum data transparency. Some non-dependent subnets can remain private, such as the subnet where II is located, and users who do not recognize it can not use II.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-12-13 18:36:49 UTC | #62

100%. And I do think the NNS subnet is the most natural starting point, especially because it plays such a crucial role in the IC, so for verifiability you'd probably want to start verifying the NNS first.

Sormarler | 2022-12-14 04:15:48 UTC | #63

I agree as long as it can be done in a way that user data will still remain private.

There are inherent limitations to the use of blockchain. If you put private data directly on the chain, you can't count on a gatekeeper to keep your privacy for you. Is that gatekeeper worthy of your trust? Are you comfortable that the user can't see your data, and the gatekeeper can?
The right thing to do is for the Dapp to deal with privacy issues before the data is submitted to the chain.

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-14 06:09:03 UTC | #65

Yeah. Blockchain should be trustless. If no mathematical proof that data is fully encrypted, it should be regarded as public. Private subnets won’t protect your privacy nor SEV

Please elaborate what you mean here, including how your suggestion would avoid the trillions of dollars per year on firewalls and other cybersecurity costs, along with trillions of dollars more per year on cybercrime like the IC apparently can. To me, this is the biggest obvious benefit -- along with much more open integrations between organizations -- of putting the entire IT stack on the IC blockchain. If your suggestion involves going back to primitive AWS-type firewalls, VPN tunnels, extreme trust in pimply-faced network IT guys, etc., then that's simply a non-starter.

Also, based on my understanding, why would you have to rely on a trusted gatekeeper for private data on the IC blockchain if the blockchain protocol is all open source and only updated via decentralized NNS  proposals (excluding the side argument that the NNS is not sufficiently decentralized yet)? Is that not analogous to saying we all have to trust some shadowy figure named Satoshi to keep our bitcoins safe from his blockchain back doors, which might include an undocumented way to reverse engineer our private keys from successive hashes and his code? 

I thought the whole magic of blockchain technology is that public blockchains could not be successfully hacked/edited (assuming < 50% of nodes edited) even though both their data and their protocol code are fully transparent for everyone to see. So why would the IC be any different for private data? Maybe I'm missing something here due to gaps in my understanding.

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-14 06:32:39 UTC | #67

While, NNS provides to Chainkey to coordinate the consensus on its subnets. Considering this scenario, 9/13 subnet nodes fakes the transaction to modify the on-chain by modify the node's code to pass verification. If the subnets are open, we can then find the Nodes are cheating by figuring who fakes the data because you can’t fake signature with wrong private key. But if the subnets are not open. Nobody knows.
And for privacy, the end users don't know the data, but the node providers do. Then you have to trust the node provider to keep your secret. With SEV, then you will have to trust AMD to keep your privacy and the nodes need to be configured properly. That means you have to trust the infrastructure to keep your privacy. That simply violates the principle of blockchain as a trustless network. Why not use AWS then?

Not as you understand it. I suggest you review the comment log on this thread and my views and claims.
Building a product on the blockchain only does not require any trust (A true blockchain is a trustless environment), any private data is kept by the users themselves, the Dapp needs to handle this in its business logic. In general, the endpoint (e.g. Web H5) can cache data and only the user's private key can handle this data, and if the data is to be put on the chain, it needs to be encrypted with the user's private key as well. If the data is put on the chain directly, Dapp developers need to think whether this data will expose user privacy.
If your privacy needs to be protected by the nodes of IC by not opening the data, then you are just using another AWS by using IC. your payment is totally unnecessary and I think Amazon is more credible than the 13 nodes of IC.
So it needs IC to open the subnet data so that the 13 nodes cannot cheat openly or all users will leave them.

Sunlight is the best disinfectant and the best safety measure!

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-14 06:45:34 UTC | #69

OK, I think I understand a bit better. Thanks, @Astrapolis-peasant and @bitbruce, and sorry for not being fully up to speed yet. 

If a private key is also required for querying, not just updates, wouldn't that private key also be able to validate any updates to one's personal data? Obviously, that is more limited that allowing the general public to validate private data updates (i.e, which updates were done with valid signatures), but couldn't that work in theory?

I had a similar concern with this private subnet issue. Wouldn't data have to be decrypted on a host machine or boundary node at some point in time (even if just in cache) in order to do SQL queries, searches, etc. (e.g., "select all records with social security numbers that start with 12345"). So even with perfect encryption while the data is stored, what could protect this data in cache without a firewall or similar measure?

In other words, perhaps a better question is what does "private" really mean on the IC, and are we still trusting a nearly anonymous node provider not to go on a treasure hunt into this private data if they are the only ones who can access it (perhaps via the cache or some other means)?

FYI - I'm not trying to be difficult or contrarian here. I'm just trying to grasp this more fully as part of my due diligence, since I see cybersecurity benefits as the biggest selling point of the IC in terms of direct dollar savings/efficiency. However, if there are significant holes in this argument, then that could be a devastating argument against the IC value narrative.

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-14 07:00:55 UTC | #70

You never reveal your data. To store encrypted data, you encrypt the data first then send it to the server, when you fetch the data you can then decrypt it by your private key. If your encrypted data is exposed at any sense (transferring even https, storage). The secret is compromised. The arguments souds like someone can send the private key over internet(considering all transfer and storage safe, eg. https, SEV), which obviously nobody does

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-14 07:12:41 UTC | #71

Yes, @Astrapolis-peasant that makes sense. So to take my business intelligence (BI) example further, if my phone is searching a 20 GB private database that includes social security numbers and other sensitive info stored on the IC, would the only way to do this securely be to download the entire 20GB encrypted database to my phone and then run my BI platform on a little phone app rather than a web server app? That would seem to be necessary given the requirement not to decrypt anything until it gets to a user-controlled endpoint. 

There could be many other examples like this too, even for transactional applications. If so, then I don't see how any sensitive information could ever be handled by web server functionality on the IC. That would rule out almost every enterprise web application ever being able to run on the IC. The IC could really only run small mobile or wallet apps when they are business or financial in nature. That would explain why the current web use cases for the IC are mostly gaming, social media and other entertainment applications, which require no sensitive enterprise data during interactions. All of this doesn't sound right vs. the DFINITY sales pitch, though, so am I missing something obvious here?

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-12-14 07:19:19 UTC | #72

Yeah. That's correct. If you tend to save like social security numbers on IC, you would have to trust CA(https), Node Providers, and AMD SEV. The safest way is to encrypt it locally and then save it to IC. That's how Encrypted Messages(You send message encrypted by receiver's public key and the receiver decrypts it with own private key), Notebooks(Symmetric Encryption) work. You could take a look at IC notebook(git example)

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-14 07:32:57 UTC | #73

Yes, that part is a given - the initial encryption would have to be at the phone or PC endpoint/client as well before it even touches the IC. However, my use case was more focused on the querying part *after* it is encrypted and stored, since that is what seems to result in the most shocking implications from my perspective. 

In short, nearly every enterprise web application relies on decrypted data to process queries, transactions or other functionality on a substantial, multi-user web server. As a result, this encryption limitation would essentially rule out the IC as a viable platform to run **any** enterprise web application. That means the Web3 world per the IC really involves a huge step back to the pre-Web world of client-server architecture, where many enterprise/business applications were essentially run on the client side. The viable use cases for the IC would be far more limited if all this is true, which I still find difficult to believe.

If you want to build traditional apps, you can't choose IC. "Everything is possible on IC" is a slogan, but it's not true, you can't simply implement traditional apps on IC, you have to refactor your app.

On AWS, at least the server is managed by you, so you can upload private data via https. But on IC, at first you just connect to an IC node via https, but that node is not yours, and if that node tries to expose your privacy or it has been hacked, your private data is leaked before it even enters the IC subnet. IC is far inferior to AWS when it comes to private data.

A Dapp's private data never leaves the user's endpoint; it doesn't travel over the network, much less into the blockchain. If you want to put private data on the chain, you must first encrypt the data in the endpoint with the user's private key. This is the real logic of blockchain to protect privacy, because it doesn't receive your private data in the first place.

Don't hope to put private data on the chain and have someone hold it for you. What's more, don't have the idea of querying data in such a way using SQL. No database engine can be built on the blockchain, and the data on the blockchain is not prepared for retrieval. If you have such an idea, we suggest you continue to use AWS. so far, AWS still can not be replaced.

Sabr | 2022-12-14 07:49:08 UTC | #75

So to summarize, it sounds like the IC is not a viable platform for B2B (enterprise) applications or any applications requiring a large amount of private data to be downloaded by a single user (e.g., BI). The IC is really only for certain B2C applications, which makes it more appropriate for independent end users running personal apps on their phone or PC. Please speak up if anyone disagrees.

You are right to be skeptical. You should not have unrealistic fantasies. Because that would not be logical or consistent with scientific explanations, and you should understand that. You have to make trade-offs before you choose IC. That's the truth.

Indeed, almost all "DAOs" are really just tiny developer teams with lots of passive followers.

I think the Dfinity team is partially responsible for the misleading propaganda about IC. It is possible that some Dfinity engineers also had the idea that he looked at IC like a cloud server and pursued the implementation of traditional business processes on IC. A lot of this thinking can be seen in the open source code of Dfinity. It is lazy and misleading. Such ideas will eventually end up in failure on the blockchain, just like IBM's Hyperledger project.

As you say, not yet, but over time all those limitations that you can quote can be resolved in IC given its evolutionary nature.

We are in the initial stages of CI, those 13 nodes will be followed by many more, each time increasing decentralization, security and CI capacity.  making AWS or Big Tech obsolete.  That's on the IC roadmap. 
Don't you see the potential for IC to become the world's decentralized computer?  That takes vision, hard work and time.

YES! To build a dapp on the blockchain, the business must be designed rationally and the developer is the first responsible person. There are things you can't blame IC.

First, it's clear from the previous discussion that you now decided to ignore, that IC protocol is a suitable candidate as a native framework to implement propietary business applications.

I wrote "some" because in some orther cases users and service providers would still want to keep this information private.
