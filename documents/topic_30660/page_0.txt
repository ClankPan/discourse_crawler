Where is the source code of `ic-admin`?

For example, I was looking to the implementation of `propose-xdr-icp-conversion-rate` but did not managed to find its implementation on GitHub neither did I find a reference on the [website](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/ic-admin/) :man_shrugging:.

Indeed, forgot to close this thread. According toml file, the source code seems to be located in following sub-folder of the main IC repo.

https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/registry/admin

Still not sure why there isn't direct search results for the implementions I were looking for. I guess there should be some composition.
