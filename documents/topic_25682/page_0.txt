I wanted to offer a couple ideas on enhancing the visual appearance of IC official website.

* Perhaps adding a subtle Gaussian blurred banner background-color along the top could inject some vibrancy. This eye-catching touch may draw people in to explore the content further. The background-color could showcase an aspect of our innovations with faded graphics that don't distract from the information itself.

* When formatting text, it's best to avoid stranded single words on their own line. Allowing more appropriate line breaks improves readability. Well-spaced paragraphs give the eyes a welcome rest as they scan the material.

I appreciate you taking the time to consider these suggestions.

We can put the last 3 words inside a ```<span>``` tag:

```
Add a <span> in <div class="md:w-7/10">
```

HTML: 
```
<span class="no-warp"> seamless multi-chain today. </span>
```

CSS: 
```
.no-warp {
    display: inline-block;
    text-decoration: inherit;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
```
