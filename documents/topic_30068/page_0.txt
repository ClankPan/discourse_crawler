I experienced failure previously when performing swap at icpswap (via plug wallet).

And when i try to reclaimmy token, it keeps saying reclaim error.
What should i do?

By the way i am new in using plug and icp network.

Thanks

Hey,
it seems that the fee required for the swap is currently not deducted automatically, which can lead to the error mentioned.

It's best to download the PlugWallet plugin for your browser and connect to your wallet. You can then log in to ICPSwap or ICLighthouse with your Internet identity - depending on which platform you have swapped with - and integrate your plug wallet there. You should then be able to reclaim your tokens via the WebApp.

I had the same problem and that's how it worked :slight_smile:

Best regards,
Markus
