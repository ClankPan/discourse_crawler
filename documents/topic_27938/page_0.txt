https://e6ets-5iaaa-aaaam-ab7lq-cai.icp0.io/ - has anybody seen this?  

Was on discord and saw it... not mine but I'd love to do something like this.  It must be a BIP-39 phrase and here's the list

https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/bip39-word-list/

Been working on it for a few hours now and I have :

1. wasp
2. the footballer could be Bakayoko ?  
3. the numbers could be A.S.C.I.I?

The man could be Anwar Sadat?

Please help me!

Nice Looks like nobody has figured it out yet, the balance is 1k ICP, assuming that's the award.
We need to guess 12 words ? If we don't know the order, that's 479,001,600 combinations.

'Plug' is bip-39 word. Top left corner
'Balance' also
Puzzle, Dog, Sand, Moon, Cloud
also possible: Stone, Wall, Apple, Prize, Effort, lesson, find, board, sample

borovan | 2024-02-28 00:28:05 UTC | #5

looks more like a wolf

infu | 2024-02-28 00:29:29 UTC | #6

right, fox is also bip-39

The guy is Allen Walker Read

https://languagemuseum.org/library/

Lots of keyword related to him. Most likely: library

there was a film mr and mrs smith?  It didn't have a doctor in it though but my memory isn't great

Wayyy to deep. Just "Title", imo... :sweat_smile:

Hazard = BIP39 :face_with_monocle: :+1:

-------------------------

infu | 2024-02-28 01:18:14 UTC | #14

If you take the numbers 12 21 3 18 5 as alphabet characters you get "Lucre"

The word "lucre" typically refers to money, especially when regarded as sordid or distastefully obtained. The term is often used in a somewhat negative context to imply that the money was earned in a way that compromises one's morals or ethics. It comes from the Latin word "lucrum," which means gain or profit.

money is not bip-39, 'profit' and 'gain' are

Looking like a 24 word combo?

No effort is an **artist**

-------------------------

sea-snake | 2024-02-28 01:34:56 UTC | #17

Assuming it's a 12 word phrase, you only need the first 11 words or first 23 words for 24 word phrase since the last word is a checksum.

My literal word attempt was no success ðŸ˜‚

interest apple wasp number effort doctor soccer board moon puzzle wolf teach

Kick1776 | 2024-02-28 01:37:14 UTC | #18

its 100% a coyote, not a wolf

Chatgpt says it means olive

-------------------------

lobosolo | 2024-02-28 04:41:05 UTC | #21

it's a twelve word phrase, but the question is how to order them, and what's up with the 1,2,3 on the puzzle pieces?

-------------------------

Shi | 2024-02-28 04:50:58 UTC | #22

I've been trying to figure out the significance of that portion of the puzzle myself

-------------------------

lobosolo | 2024-02-28 04:57:04 UTC | #23

maybe "one, two, and three" could be part of it? idk. No Effort could translate to "easy" the riddle on the bottom could be "example" just some ideas

-------------------------

lobosolo | 2024-02-28 05:40:26 UTC | #24

Oh! Actually Iâ€™m pretty sure it just means that three words come from that one image. That makes the most sense to me

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-02-28 07:47:32 UTC | #25

I believe I cannot figure it out. :joy:

- Lots of blanks for a 24 word phrase.. 
- To much info for a 12 word phrase
- The order might be the biggest issue

Impossible.. :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-02-28 10:45:58 UTC | #27

This challenge is pure evil haha, even if you had certainty about the 12 words it would take some time to find the right permutation. Now you're not even sure you have the right words, or if it's 12 or 24 words. 

Good luck!

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-02-28 10:46:32 UTC | #28

`Numbers` is not bip39.

-------------------------

bouen | 2024-02-28 10:49:27 UTC | #29

Jup. Seen that. "Number" is. :wink:

But since they actual 'numbers', I'm probably off here and they could be everything. :stuck_out_tongue:

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-02-28 10:52:22 UTC | #30

The numbers look like coordinates, and if you look it up: https://www.google.com/maps/search/12+21+3+18+5?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwifscOmz82EAxUC0wIHHajaCo8Q8gF6BAgjEAA

It's Dosso in Niger, and there is a picture at this coordinates which represents a home.

So my guess is home.

-------------------------

infu | 2024-02-28 11:08:26 UTC | #31

Pretty cool to see everyone contributing something others would have probably never guessed.
There is probably something connecting every clue and figuring out what that is will narrow down possible words. Like.. why this house of all the houses in the world?

-------------------------

sea-snake | 2024-02-28 11:19:38 UTC | #32

Maybe the seed phrase is there physically on a sign, anyone planning to book a flight ðŸ˜‚?

House looks more like a store, so I would guess that instead of home. Also see solar panels, so maybe solar.

1000 $ICP will get you there...

Maybe this will help - figuring out how it was created:

Too late, somebody solved it an hour ago straight to Binance (wasn't me!).

-------------------------

NS01 | 2024-02-28 12:49:59 UTC | #36

This was good fun. I'm gutted I missed the chance to get involved. Reminds me of the treasure hunt by DogFinity (did anyone get that one?). 

Kudos to the two devs behind it, and for putting your own money in the prize pool ðŸ’–

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-02-28 13:39:15 UTC | #37

It was fun, didn't manage to find the seed as well.

I was trying permutation of 
`vec![ "hazard", "interest", "home", "easy", "example", "coyote", "moon", "desert", "library", "title", "apple", "wasp"].` 

I hope the person who found or the devs will disclose the seed :)

-------------------------

AndyBrier01 | 2024-02-28 13:44:51 UTC | #38

I had:

apple interest wasp time effort okay title hint sample lesson find hazard

Apparently Allen Read was an etymologist and his most famous research was around the word 'okay'. Also I read the numbers as a 'time' and the jigsaw as a 'hint' that the seed words were clockwise in order. Thought I had it but alas, no.

-------------------------

Shi | 2024-02-28 14:55:29 UTC | #39

Yeah I would love to know what the seed phrase was also. Very challenging game.

-------------------------

lobosolo | 2024-02-28 15:08:45 UTC | #40

Man. Gg whoever got it. I thought I was getting close but it was really difficult. These were some of the words I thought it was: 

Abstract

Wasp

Curve? Profit? Axis? Growth?

Hazard

Easy Easily? 

Example

Cruel (i got this because somebody posted LUCRE from the numbers) 

Okay

Title

Coyote

Puzzle

Desert 

For those who donâ€™t know the plug at the top is the wallet and you can only recover a wallet with 12 words there

borovan | 2024-02-28 16:48:37 UTC | #41

Congrats to the winner, enjoy the ICP :)

-------------------------

Yasharsaljoughi | 2024-02-29 21:54:58 UTC | #42

So what was it?
I am interested to know

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-03-03 18:05:21 UTC | #43

Even knowing the 12 words, getting the order was 1/470 mil
