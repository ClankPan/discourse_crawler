Hello, I deployed Cancan on the IC network but encountered some problems. My steps are:
1. Download the cancan source code from github and use the git tool;
2. Enter the cancan directory and execute npm ci
3. Execute dfx deploy --network ic
4. Get cancan_ui: awt7d-kiaaa-aaaai-qahha-cai
5. Open in the browser: https://awt7d-kiaaa-aaaai-qahha-cai.ic0.app/
6. Check the error shown in the screenshot through F12

Hey @HashBamboo 

I'm not super familiar with CanCan, but from looking at the errors, it seems like the app is attempting to load resources from, and make requests from, localhost. That would not work, is there some config/paths you need to set?
