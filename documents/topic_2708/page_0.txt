I am using Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS, and I can't run any dfx commands after installing dfx 0.7.0-beta.4, 0.7.0-beta.5, or 0.7.0-beta.6. 0.7.0-beta.3 works just fine.

I get the following errors:

```bash
dfx: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by dfx)
dfx: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by dfx)
```

Hey @lastmjs, thanks for the note.

We'll be unable to release a version of DFX that works without glibc 2.29 in the near term because it's actually quite a heavy lift.

Have you tried installing glibc >= 2.29? This should be a workaround for you. The current LTS of Ubuntu (20.03) has the right version of glibc.

That sounds good, I haven't tried yet. I believe Ubuntu 16 just went out of LTS, so I shouldn't expect it to be supported. Thanks for the update

I just updated my OS and dfx seems to be working, thanks again

The same problems in Ubuntu 18.04:
```sh
 dfx -h
dfx: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by dfx)
```

I'm not sure this has been fixed yet but I also had the same issue with 18.04 and fixed it by upgrading to 20.03. Not ideal, but that's one solution.

Have your tried a later version of dfx? It's at 0.8.1 now, I believe.
