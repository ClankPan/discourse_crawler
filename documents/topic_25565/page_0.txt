I tried to access this method **get_account_transactions()** through javascript and my payload is, 
here is my code, **start** is an **Opt NAT argument** and I passed 0 and I'm not sure about it. 

const **transactionArg** = {
        max_results: 100,
        account: {
            owner: Principal.fromText(process.env.MY_CANISTER),
            subaccount: [],
        },
        **start: 0**
    }

try {
        const transactions = await **ckBtc_Transac_API.get_account_transactions(transactionArg);**
        console.log(ckBtc_Transac_API);
        console.log("transactions", transactions);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("error", error);
    }
}

The type is `Opt NAT`, and if you pass `0` you pass a `NAT`. You first need to wrap it in the optional type. While I don't really know Js, I got it to work with `[0]` instead of `0` in a similar example. Can you try that?
