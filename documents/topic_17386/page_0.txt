If I want to call this function from the bitcoin example code



```
  /// Sends the given amount of bitcoin from this canister to the given address.
  /// Returns the transaction ID.
  public func send(request : SendRequest) : async Text {
    Utils.bytesToText(await BitcoinWallet.send(NETWORK, DERIVATION_PATH, KEY_NAME, request.destination_address, request.amount_in_satoshi));
  };`
```


from inside the same `main.mo`, I'm trying to do it like this:



```
 public func withdrawBtc(btc_withdrawal_amount : Nat64, btc_withdrawal_address : Text) : async Text {

    let btcWithdrawRequest : SendRequest = {
      destination_address = btc_withdrawal_address;
      amount_in_satoshi = btc_withdrawal_amount;
    };

    send(btcWithdrawRequest);
  };
```

but the `send(btcWithdrawRequest);` part says 

**`expression of type**
**  async<$withdrawBtc> Text**
**cannot produce expected type**
**  Text Motoko`**

How do I fix this or what's wrong with it?

Put `await` before the call to `send`.
