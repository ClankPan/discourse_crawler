Dfinity community,

The discussion for resolving non-actionable/non-deliberated (also known as spam) proposals has been encouraging and has produced a lot of good ideas. It appears the ideation/brainstorming phase of this issue is slowing down and it may be time to move into a process of narrowing down the ideas to one or a few solutions for implementation. Wenzel Bartlett ([@wpb](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/wpb)) and I would like to recommend the following timeline and process for narrowing down the ideas into actionable resolution, utilizing the NNS for voting between multiple options. The goal of this process is to provide NNS voters a complete list of all solutions that will be brought forward in the short term, so that voters have the ability to deliberate each proposal on its own merits as well as relative to other proposals.

Now through 18APR: Proposal leaders step forward to announce that they plan to bring a specific, actionable proposal to the NNS. The proposal leader provides the draft text they plan to include in the proposal in a new forum topic, as well as leads the discussion (via the forum or other communication means) on their proposal.

18APR: Wenzel will make an informational proposal announcing the list of proposals that will be brought to the NNS over the following one week. This proposal will provide links to the forum (or other social media) where NNS voters can learn more about each upcoming proposal.

18APR - 25APR: Proposal leaders submit their proposals for voting on the NNS. NNS voters will have the option to vote in favor of one or multiple proposals. Each proposal will be open for the standard proposal timeframe (meaning it is possible that some proposals close prior to other proposals opening).

Post 25APR: DFINITY provides feedback to the community on the technical feasibility of the approved proposal(s), including technical trade-offs and opportunity costs. If needed, another proposal can be made by the community to refine the approved proposal(s) based on DFINITY's feedback.

Our Ask To The Community
Wenzel and I do not intend to submit proposals for every idea discussed in the last week. Instead, we would like to ask for leaders to represent the various ideas, both in terms of soliciting community feedback and for writing the proposal copy. At a minimum, Wenzel and I plan to bring our proposal “[Reset Followees for All Topics Except Governance](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reset-followees-for-the-all-topics-except-governance-category/11922/90)” for NNS vote during the one week period. It is our hope that every idea discussed over the past week will be submitted as a proposal during the one  week time including the following ideas:

* Increase the cost of submitting proposals
* [Add an approval step prior to proposals reaching the NNS](https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1511784862784573444)
* Decrease the weighting of governance proposals
* [Fix governance proposal weights to a time period](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915)
* Any other idea that is generated after this post (or any idea I failed to include in this post)

Please use this forum thread to identify any proposals you plan to submit. This forum will be used to ensure that the NNS proposal announcing the one week period includes information about every proposal that will be submitted during that week.

This forum can also be used by community members to signal that they disagree with the idea of bringing all ideas to a vote on NNS over a one week period.

**CALL TO ACTION:**

1. Consider if you would like to be a proposal leader on one or multiple ideas mentioned over the past week. If so, please make your intention known as a reply to this forum and begin socializing your proposal draft in the medium of your choice.  At a minimum, please post your proposal draft to a new forum topic.
2. Community members - Join the deliberation on each proposal
3. NNS voters - Vote on your preferred solution(s) between 18APR and 25APR 

Background on the issue we aim to resolve
The intent of the one week period is for the NNS community to vote on every idea that has been discussed for resolving non-actionable proposals. Non-actionable proposals are submitted to the NNS for two reasons:

1. To increase the number of governance proposals and therefore the rewards paid to NNS members who vote on governance proposals.
2. To advertise or market to the NNS community.

Q + A (Will update as discussion occurs below)

1. **What is DFINITY's role?** While I welcome DFINITY to provide its feedback on any and all proposals prior to the vote, it seems unrealistic to expect DFINITY to evaluate each proposal. Instead, it seems more efficient to allow the NNS community to narrow down the ideas into one or a few solutions and then invite DFINITY's feedback. If DFINITY's feedback requires additional changes to the accepted proposal(s), either due to technical or security concerns, then the accepted proposal(s) could be modified and taken to the NNS for another vote.
2. **What will happen if multiple proposals pass?** The intent is for the NNS community to evaluate each idea on its own AND in connection with the other ideas presented. It’s possible that multiple proposals pass. In those cases, I suggest that any passing proposals are implemented, providing the NNS community a way to combine ideas into a solution.
3. **Why one week of proposals?** I believe it is unlikely that we can coordinate the submission of all proposals at the same time, so one week is intended to allow for flexibility in the submission of each proposal. However, it is intended that all proposals will be known prior to the beginning of the week, so that NNS participants can evaluate each one prior to voting on the first proposal.
4. **Why aren’t you submitting all the proposals?** We would like other leaders to submit their ideas to discussion and as proposals in order to ensure the proposal matches its intent and to provide an opportunity for a diversity in voices. It’s possible that Wenzel and I will submit another proposal (in addition to the proposal identified above) if no leader steps up to represent an idea we feel strongly in favor of. 
5. **What if I don't know how to submit a proposal?** Wenzel has offered to submit a proposal on behalf of any proposal leader, if needed. However, it is the responsibility of the proposal leader to provide the title and copy of the proposal.
6. **What happens if a new proposal emerges during the week voting period?** There's nothing stopping anyone from submitting proposals before, during or after the week voting period. Our objective of this process is to provide advanced knowledge of every proposal to NNS voters so that they can be judged relative to each other. If additional proposals are made outside of this process then it is up to each NNS voter to determine how he/she wants to evaluate them.

There are non-actionable governance proposals that have significant value to the community. For example, the fact that one can warn about the implications of tax treatment (& risks) associated with the new way of compounding maturity. Why should such governance proposals cost more?

Ultimately the purpose of increasing the weightage of governance proposals was to increase community participation. If everyone votes in governance proposals,  then i suppose we would not be having this discussion. Why then are we  trying to solve for an issue for disinterested parties? If they don't vote on governance proposals, well we cannot make them vote. Why make everyone suffer for inaction of disinterested parties?

EasySteve | 2022-04-10 20:33:09 UTC | #3

Thank you for putting this together @wpb @Kyle_Langham. 

I'd like to propose an option not mentioned above. In short I propose adding the option to manually abstain from governance proposals, proposals resulting in a manual abstain would have significantly reduced rewards (equal to that of non-governance proposals). This would allow non-actionable proposals to maintain a place in the governance system and increase the difficulty to abuse the system for monetary gain.

There is a lot to unpack with this option, I will draft up a proposal and share under a new forum topic asap.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-10 20:42:18 UTC | #4

@justmythoughts @ysyms @superduper @LightningLad91 

I think each of you may have identified potential proposal topics that could be included in this effort.  Do any of you want to shape them into an actionable proposal that can be deliberated by the community and submitted to the NNS?

If nobody else picks it up, then I will be submitting a proposal for increasing the proposal rejection cost.

@wpb @Kyle_Langham 

Thanks for accelerating and pushing forward the discussion on reforming NNS proposals (to combat spam/improve the quality of NNS proposals).

Regarding the last two items of the proposed timeline:

[quote="Kyle_Langham, post:1, topic:12049"]
18APR - 25APR: Proposal leaders submit their proposals for voting on the NNS. NNS voters will have the option to vote in favor of one or multiple proposals. Each proposal will be open for the standard proposal timeframe (meaning it is possible that some proposals close prior to other proposals opening).

Post 25APR: DFINITY provides feedback to the community on the technical feasibility of the approved proposal(s), including technical trade-offs and opportunity costs. If needed, another proposal can be made by the community to refine the approved proposal(s) based on DFINITY’s feedback.
[/quote]

It might make if these are flipped. Ideally, the community shouldn't be voting on proposals that DFINITY themselves have declared infeasible, or have raised major red flags about. I would give at the very minimum a 2-week period for the foundation to comment back-and-forth with the proposal discussion leads, and the community in each of the proposed solutions. As you said, we don't want to rush into a vote without understanding all of the tradeoffs, and potential unintended consequences.

Also, if we have 3-5 proposals all being discussed, this 2-week period might be a bit too quick to get the entire community involved and fully digest all of the proposals, especially for a such an important change to the NNS that will hopefully last years. Why the rush, and why not extend the deliberation/feedback period to 1-2 months?

<br/>

@diegop 

The foundation has been surprisingly quiet on the forums regarding these proposals and discussions. Between both proposals mentioned in the original post by Kyle (with links) and over 100 responses, only 2 of these responses have been from foundation members thus far.

I don't know if this is by design (to obstain from influencing the discussion and get the community involved first), but I for one would like to hear more feedback from the foundation regarding the current discussions/proposals, as well as what some of the ideas inside the foundation are for improving the NNS proposals system, as well as how the [Q2 spam control roadmap item](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reset-followees-for-the-all-topics-except-governance-category/11922/88) will play out.

Not sure if this is too much to ask, but it would be very helpful if someone from the foundation could look into designating a few DFINITY/NNS team members to put aside a small, but certain portion of their time during this period of potential changes to the NNS proposal system, in order to ensure that both the perspective of the foundation and the NNS team is heard with respect to each of the proposals that are introduced. 

This input from the foundation is extremely important to me, and I don't want to be voting on or putting forth a proposal to change the NNS without having that proposal be vetted by as many eyes as possible.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-10 23:37:41 UTC | #6

@wpb i would be happy to submit the proposal if you can provide me with a link to the document explaining how to do so.

One question; is the expectation that our proposals will be deliberated through the 18th or are you proposing we actually submitted them ASAP and have folks vote through the 18th?

Different topic:

Are you and @Kyle_Langham planning to submit your original proposal as-is or do you expect to make any adjustments based on the open discussion from your forum topic?

Thanks for all the effort.

The best resource for learning how to submit a proposal is this IC wiki:
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Create_an_NNS_motion_proposal

You also need to see this DFX release note:
https://smartcontracts.org/docs/release-notes/0.9.0-rn

The wiki contains some suggestions on best practices for what to include in your proposal.

Regarding timeline…
Try to submit your proposal for deliberation on the forum between now and Apr 18.  The goal is to submit the group proposals to the NNS on April 18 through Apr 25.  The dates may change.  The idea is to coordinate efforts within reason.

Kyle and I will make a few changes to our proposal and will post the revision early this week.

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-11 03:43:38 UTC | #8

Thanks Wenzel. I’ll try to get to work on it tomorrow.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-11 12:02:42 UTC | #9

Thanks for the topic, @wpb @Kyle_Langham.

I would like to put forward an idea. In the theme of biomimetics, I propose a type of spam detector that works by inhibiting governance proposals when certain conditions are met. I am still drafting it, but my thinking is something like this:

1.	Spam proposals should not be considered a normal part of any governance system.
2.	Reviewing all proposals burdens the network and can facilitate bias or surveillance.
3.	Biological neural networks do not monitor themselves, but instead rely on homeostasis to adapt to changing conditions or events, often using inhibitory processes [1].
4.	There should be a separate, parallel system that inhibits governance proposals, activated by reports of spam, that works to channel proposals away from public view and/or into a review process.
5.	This system of governance inhibition requires no changes to the existing governance system, is responsive down to a single neuron, and can be later adapted to defend against other types of attack. 

I will make a new topic for this once it is ready and can do this by the 18th. I agree with @justmythoughts about a longer deliberation period and doing a sanity check with DFINTY before submitting the proposals. This is particularly true of this idea, as one clear disadvantage is the initial effort needed to get it running and it would be nice to know if this is a showstopper ahead of time.

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-11 12:54:14 UTC | #10

Awesome, thanks for your leadership Steve!

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-11 13:04:40 UTC | #11

Thanks for your feedback!

Regarding timeline, I would be open to extending the 18APR-25APR proposal deliberation timeline if it will either (a) provide needed time for deliberation on new ideas or (b) if DFINITY expresses a desire to comment on some or all of the ideas prior to the voting period and has requested time to do so.

The one week deliberation time was chosen with the assumption that most ideas have already been deliberated the prior week, however there's certainly no rush and I would hate to limit the deliberation of any idea that needs more time.  I don't want to extend it by months (unless there is a good reason to do so like point b above) because I don't think that timeline will produce more value-add deliberation and I don't want this topic to get stale.  Certainly extending by a week or two is feasible.

I agree that it would be advantageous for DFINITY to comment prior to the voting period.  I don't want to force DFINITY to comment, particularly if they don't want to sway the community's deliberation or don't want to invest the human resources on feasibility studies.  I think it's wise to move forward with the assumption that DFINITY won't comment prior to the voting period, but also be flexible with our process in the event that DFINITY does comment. 

Thoughts?

**Simple anti-spam proposal:**

1. Allow NNS neurons to be configured with a 'whitelist' of neuron IDs that they will consider proposals from. 
 a) **The user should be able to turn on the option to automatically reject all proposals from non whitelisted neurons.**
b) This list should have sensible defaults. e.g. Dfinity foundation, Internet computer association, all named follow neurons in the app, neurons corresponding to working groups.
c) The user should be able to edit the list to add new neurons to the list or delete spammy neurons from the list.
d) The user should be able to edit the list for all the neurons they control in a single operation.
e) Where the neuron follows another neuron for a given topic these liquid democracy based follow relationships should override any auto-rejection. That is if you follow cycleDAO and cycleDAO votes approve on a proposal from a non whitelisted node your neurons still vote approve even though you have selected automatically reject.

*Possible objection 1*: Excluding proposals from unknown parties could increase governance centralisation.

In most circumstances proposers of credible proposals are likely to be known or able to convince some known party to submit a proposal on their behalf, even where it is important for a proposer to be anonymous they will still be able to advertise the neuron offline and ask to be added to the whitelist. 

It is true that  a new proposer without any reputation will have to run two campaigns (1) to be added to whitelists (2) for the proposal to be approved. This will therefore encourage the formation of secondary chambers and [working groups](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-technical-working-groups/11781/6). 

That is  instead of a new person just submitting a proposal directly to the NNS they will be more likely to be successful if they ask some well known organisation or DAO to submit on their behalf.  We can therefore expect community organisations to develop some kind of process for vetting proposals prior to submitting them. This IMHO would be a good thing that actually encourages the development of multiple deliberative governance processes similar to having multiple EIP type channels.

*Possible objection 2*: Makes it too easy to auto reject everything. 

It would remain easier to just follow another neuron delegating decision making to them so this is unlikely to be a problem in practice. Besides the choice of auto rejecting everything is still a legitimate one, and one that cannot be prevented.

-------------------------

I'm not the most knowledgeable member here on this matter, so I would like to ask: 

If the weighting of governance proposals are decreased, would that have any affect of distributed rewards, or will it be leveled based on other proposal topics?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-11 16:46:57 UTC | #14

@willguest @Hashimoto 

You may want to start another forum Governance topic focused on your individual proposal.  That would make it easier to keep conversations about your proposal focused instead of getting lost in comments about other proposals in this thread.

@Kyle_Langham

Why is it *wise* to move forward to vote on a proposal without any feedback or comment from DFINITY? I’m not saying that no votes should ever happen without DFINITY, but I’d definitely prefer to at least have the foundation give a once over of each of these proposals before they hit the NNS.

Unless DFINITY comes out and explicitly says they won’t be commenting for reason x, I think we should be cautious about any proposal that hits the NNS after ~1 week of visibility without DFINITY’s feedback.

For example, your Neuron Indexing proposal got feedback from several DFINITY employees (both positive & negative criticism), but the proposal itself went through the ringer and we can assume that most of the important arguments were laid out in the topic for everyone to see - that’s why I personally felt confident in voting for it.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-13 12:54:56 UTC | #17

Hi @justmythoughts,

Sorry, I should have chosen my words more carefully.  I don't think it's wise to move forward without any feedback from DFINITY, but I do think its wise to plan to move forward regardless of whether DFINITY provides feedback.  Basically, I don't want to get into a situation where (a) the NNS is held up waiting on feedback that never comes or (b) forcing DFINITY to put resources into providing feedback on a topic that they may not want to.  To sum it up - I would much prefer DFINITY provide feedback (as you do) but I also want to be prepared for a situation where they don't provide feedback prior to NNS voting.

Regarding the 1 week timeframe, keep in mind that many of the topics have been discussed for the previous week and a half.  For topics that are still being discussed, I'd be happy to extend the timeline to ensure that all topics are well deliberated and the NNS community feels they have enough information to make an informed choice.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-17 18:28:20 UTC | #18

As of this time (15APR22, 0833 EST), here are the proposal that have been made and deliberated.  Please let me know if I have left any actionable proposals off this list.

 [Double Blind Proposal Review System](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/double-blind-proposal-review-system/12195) led by @MrPink13 

[Increase Proposal Rejection Cost](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increase-proposal-rejection-cost/12110/14) led by @LightningLad91 

 [Countering proposal spam by allowing auto-filtering proposals by neuron ID](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-proposal-countering-proposal-spam-by-allowing-auto-filtering-proposals-by-neuron-id/12157) led by @Hashimoto 

[Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/periodic-confirmation-of-neuron-followees/12109/17) led by @wpb and @Kyle_Langham 

[A governance inhibition system for dealing with spam proposals](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-a-governance-inhibition-system-for-dealing-with-spam-proposals/12121) led by @willguest 

Again, please let me know if I've left off any actionable proposals.  I'll continue to edit this post to ensure this list is accurate.

**Proposal Leaders - please let me know if you think your topic needs more deliberation than the 18APR timeline.**  I want to ensure we have full dialogue before taking all of these proposals to the NNS for vote.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-04-15 14:14:05 UTC | #19

The proposal made by @MrPink13 needs more deliberation. No one considered my answer, except @MrPink13 himself.. The problems that I underlined are still unsolved. If there is not such problems, thank to people to enlighten me by explaining it to me the solution, because I did not find the solution yet, and I did not see any answer either about this there.

In its current state, I don't see why the randomly assigned neurons to filter N-A proposals, with a lot of ICP, would filter these proposals. For them, let pass a spam would be more rewarding than filtering it. Why would we assume that the filterer would not have a similar spirit to the spammer's. It is a problem of *regressus ad infinitum* here.

So, incentivize the filterers neurons to act genuinely stays an entire problem for the moment. We can't delay the same problem to an upper layer. So let us find the missing point : incentivize a genuine behavior of the upper layer. Plus, a spammer could become the filterer of another proposal eventually, so the problem can't be avoided.

I have a solution by the way @MrPink13, but I would love hear others' firstly. See you there : https://forum.dfinity.org/t/using-randomly-assigned-neurons-to-filter-for-non-actionable-proposals/12114?u=roman

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-15 13:59:52 UTC | #20

How to resolve non-actionable/non-deliberated (also known as spam) proposals? I have a simple idea: 1. The voting rewards of governance proposals should not be different from other types of proposals; 2. If your proposal is adopted, then you should be rewarded with 1 ICP; 3. If your proposal is rejected, then, in addition to the loss of 1 ICP (or more?), then you should be forbidden from submitting a new proposal for a month, and if too many proposals (maybe 3?) are rejected continuously, then perhaps you should be forbidden from submitting any new proposals for a year (or forever?); 4. (Optional) Only 8 year gang can submit a proposal? (Note: No one can give a precise definition of spam, and the IC community should support free speech absolutely.)

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-15 14:35:45 UTC | #22

Hi Kusiyo,

Could you create a forum thread to discuss you idea and include the specific changes you are recommending?  The purpose of this is to (1) allow the community the opportunity to discuss the idea in as concrete terms as possible and (2) to make clear the actual proposal that will go forward to the NNS.

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-04-15 14:39:55 UTC | #23

Oh wow. Yeah your right. Proper identification is a behavior we definitely want to reward. My apologies i got sucked into balancing my proposal and misread your initial points.

If you have a solution, please share, you may be right and it may be the final piece pf this puzzle. Probably the most important piece.

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-04-15 14:49:03 UTC | #24

In all honesty almost all proposals i have seen so far have really good points that solve key problems.

@LightningLad91 Lightninglads proposal cost increase sets a barrier for entry.

@willguest identified that its not necassary for humans to review all proposals and the suggestion of an ai filter is awesome.

@Roman if you can solve the problem of rewarding users to actually pay attention to incoming proposals then... 

I think we have a very tight knit system here. One that can remain even after people parties come into play.

@MrPink13, @hashimoto, @willguest, @wpb do you feel ready to move forward with your proposals?  I've mentioned the idea of delaying the 18APR start of proposal voting.  We can still do that if you feel you need more time for discussion and edits.  If not, we can move forward with posting all the proposals between 19APR and 25APR (with an introduction proposal tomorrow).

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-17 18:46:10 UTC | #29

I am still new to the forum and this is really the first time I have put ideas forward here, so I am happy to hear thoughts on how to improve them and find a good route to a formal proposal.

On one hand, I think my proposal solves certain problems that others don't but, on the other hand, do not feel that it has been thoroughly critiqued in the discussion. Several replies suggested other possible solutions, but few really addressed the structure I posted. Generally I would not say that the proposal has "broad support within the community", which has been noted as the goal of putting things into the forum. 

I would love to move forward with it, but I have a strong suspicion that the proposal would not pass without amendment so unless I hear other voices of support or can develop it more, I will not take it further.

Yes, I am updating the Microtasks proposal and putting the finishing touches on it. I have come to the conclusion that all these systems suffer from the same critical error. They rely on a mechanical mechanisms that are meant to be set in place and forgotten. This is is extremely unreliable and could extend ad infinitum. Its a mistake and they will be gamed eventually. We need vetted humans in the loop.

I am ready to submit this proposal at any time. @wpb can you help me out here?

What about hosting a Twitter Space a few days next week for people to present their proposal, and then to go back and forth with arguments for/against. Both Kyle and Wenzel have pretty decent sized Twitter/substack followings, so I’m sure you both could bring in a decent turnout

@LightningLad91 @MrPink13 @justmythoughts @willguest @skilesare @Hashimoto @kusiyo @EasySteve 

How important to you is it that we submit the announcement proposal that contains links to all forum discussions for proposals that you all plan to submit?  Technically an announcement is classified as spam because it is not actionable, but there is a utility in doing it.  I'm on the fence and leaning toward not doing the announcement, but only if you agree that it is not necessary.  I think everyone should feel free to submit their proposals any time over the next week regardless.  I am more than happy to submit the announcement if you feel it is important.  I am also happy to include this type of announcement in the body of the proposal that @Kyle_Langham and I plan to submit so that it informs people of the alternative proposals they can consider.  I'll wait for your advice.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-19 01:19:43 UTC | #35

In favor of submitting an announcement  proposal - I think an informative proposal like this should hit the NNS. 

Not everyone is as active on the forums (they’re technically developer forums), but they will be more likely to see and engage with all of these ideas if they’re well organized in a succinct summary with links to each of the forum posts that a significant portion NNS voters **will** see.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-19 01:18:01 UTC | #36

Hi @willguest.  I think your proposal attacks the problem in a unique way and, as such, I think it would be beneficial to be include within the group of proposed ideas.

The purpose of the forum (in my opinion) is to (1) educate the community on a problem and possible solution and (2) solicit feedback to help refine the solution.  I think your forum post accomplished #1.  It sounds like you are hesitant because you feel you did not accomplish #2.  To that I would say that while the forum is filled with incredible minds who are dedicated to the IC, I don't believe that forum participation is true sample of voters on the NNS.  Much of the voting power on the NNS doesn't provide feedback via the forum, at least from my anecdotal evidence, and vote totals could differ vastly than the perceived forum discussion.  The tax proposal is a good example of this.

I would suggest you move forward with the proposal.  But then again, it's not my 1 ICP :slight_smile:

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-19 01:27:52 UTC | #37

Thank you for asking; I have no preference.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-19 02:16:41 UTC | #38

In some sense, spam proposals can affect our voting rewards so dramatically only because the reward mechanism itself is now in a non-equilibrium state. This may reveal very important information for the NNS governance.
I personally welcome any proposals, including "spam" proposals and, of course, your announcement proposal, since they all reveal some information more or less to the IC community.
If we can see all of this as an internal part of the evolution process of NNS, then maybe we should not be so pissed off by recent spam proposals and just should be more patient.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-19 02:20:47 UTC | #39

I probably won’t submit mine if the submission amount is raised. 10 ICP is actually a significant amount for ICDevs at the moment. Especially since I have two. I don’t see enough support for them at the moment.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-19 08:37:00 UTC | #40

I would be in favour of putting the announcement into a proposal, but perhaps classifying it under something other than governance.

I think it is a great way to help people realise that several option are now on the table - personally I think it's wonderful that so many detailed ideas grew from around this idea.

Thanks again @wpb @Kyle_Langham

-------------------------

Hashimoto | 2022-04-19 09:13:07 UTC | #41

I only have one commentator and one like on my discussion thread. I would like to see more feedback before moving forward. But I may well submit anyway just to figure out how to do so.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-20 01:26:07 UTC | #42

The proposal that @Kyle_Langham and I developed titled “[Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)” is live in the NNS.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-20 03:08:56 UTC | #43

It was said previously, but I'll repeat it again for anyone who needs help.  I you need help learning how to submit a proposal or you want me to submit your proposal for you, then just let me know via DM.  Everyone should feel free to submit their proposal any time this week.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-20 11:09:15 UTC | #44

Obviously the vote is very close on my proposal so it could easily flip in the next day. Even if my proposal passes i suspect it will take a few days to push out the actual change. When are you expecting to submit your proposal?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-20 12:58:08 UTC | #45

There isn't a real grace period as I found out with my first ICDevs proposal. It was in flight when the new wait for quiet went into effect and it got extended 4 days when it would have otherwise passed at the end of the period.  I thought that variable was hooked up to an auto-update once the proposal passes....maybe it is a different proposal type that needs to go through.  I'd rather know what I'm getting into.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-20 14:47:23 UTC | #46

This was just a motion proposal. The actual change will be pushed afterwards. I’ve already had others ask if we can push the date out to allow for all these spam proposal ideas to be submitted. That’s why I was wondering how long it would take you to submit yours.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-20 14:52:49 UTC | #47

Ok...I'll look at trying to get them submitted soon.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-21 22:42:30 UTC | #48

I’m a little surprised that no one else has submitted their proposals to the NNS yet.  Please feel free to do so any time.  Let me know if you need help.  The [proposal to increase proposal reject cost to 10 ICP](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55141) passed today, so there is a good chance that Dfinity will implement that change within the next 24 hours.  Hence, now is still a good time to get you proposal submitted.

@wpb This is because you and @Kyle_Langham gave the community 2 weeks to create governance proposals (April 18th deadline), and <= 1 week to deliberate on those them before sending them to the NNS.

It takes considerable time to draft proposals and even more time to review and vet these proposals.

The unintended consequences of quickly passing proposals such as increasing the reject cost will now be felt for the next few months.

Here are a few of these consequences (of us moving too fast).

1. Once this reject cost proposal change is made (I think it was executed), we won’t see many new governance proposals for awhile, except by larger, centralized organizations that are willing to take the risk like Maxis, cycle_dao, and maybe IC_Devs. These organizations may act as gatekeepers, offering to foot some of the bill for a proposal if they approve of it or earmark features in it.


2. There is still an increased reward to voters voters from voting on governance rewards, so if the rate of proposal submissions drops off, voters may be more receptive to approving new proposals regardless of their quality, which would keep the proposal cost at 1 ICP. This could bring us to a situation where before, voters were incentivized to **vote** on spam proposals, but now voters are incentivized to **approve** spam proposals.


@icpjesse I listened to episode 6 of your podcast last night where you talked about this being a problem that we, the community created by trying to turbocharge governance voter turnout with financial incentives before the community naturally reached those turnout levels. 

Why did we do this?

It could be to incentivize decentralize participation and decentralization of the NNS (which Wenzel did succeed on), but it also coincidentally happened at the same time the ICP token was in a massive bear market and both the community and foundation were trying to give early investors a reason to lock up their tokens and stay invested.

We have to consider the unintended outcomes of all of these proposals and give ourselves the time to do so before pushing them out. DFINITY lets proposals sit for at least 1-2 months before pushing them out, and there’s a good reason for that. They have a 20-year roadmap and viewpoint, and therefore make changes that are deliberate, planned, and vetted. What’s happening right now is a blip on the radar.

I understand that receiving 2 spam proposals a day is annoying, but I ask that we try to balance short-term action with giving the community the necessary time to do their due diligence.

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-23 00:04:44 UTC | #50

It wasn’t down intentionally - I would describe it as a knock on effect of several changes made to solve other problems. @wpb can provide more detail I’m sure. If I’m remembering correctly was a known issue on the list of things to be resolved - but this has brought it all to a head.

10 ICP is going to hurt and will drastically reduce the ability for us to make the bold proposals we want to. I’d suggest setting it back to 1.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:49, topic:12049"]

A better question may be that now that we e increased form 2% to 40+%, why not set it back?

I’d suggest that you will be deducted 10 ICP after the change for I to effect. I’d recommend submitting from a 1 ICP neuron. You can always merge back later.

@justmythoughts @skilesare What is preventing you from summarizing your proposal(s) and moving forward?  If you need more time to deliberate, then take more time to deliberate.  If you are ready to submit the proposal to the NNS, then submit to the NNS.  If you think your proposal has value at 1 ICP, then it should also have value at 10 ICP.  The proposal will only cost you the rejection fee if it is rejected.  What do you need to do to have confidence that it will not be rejected?  The proposal rejection fee has gone up, but it was clearly announced and deliberated and there was plenty of time to submit proposals before it went up.  I don’t see why the increased proposal rejection fee would change your course of action if you feel you have a strong proposal.  Make sure you are submitting something that has a high probability of passing.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-23 04:35:15 UTC | #54

I have two or three projects going live next week and I've just been absolutely under the pump.  I submitted the proposal to deliberations to the ICDevs board a couple of days ago, but no responses thus far...everyone is slammed.  I don't think what I have created has a strong chance of passing. I'm willing to pay $20 of our donor's contributions to stir debate, but $200 is a sizeable chunk of our Community treasury. I'm not saying I won't do it, but that it is harder to do.  Once the proposal was submitted to increase I have to assume it will pass and the value will change while my proposal is mid-flight.  It has happened before with wait for quiet.  If I'm going to be hit for 10ICP I'd like to be certain that is the number rather than thinking it might be 1 and getting hit with 10.  I'm a silly human and my brain just works that way.  Thinking Fast and Slow Chapter 6 or something. :joy:

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-23 05:32:06 UTC | #55

I respect your opinion, but please have some perspective. This whole proposal “hackathon” was really rushed, and I voiced my concerns early in the process.

Not all of us have the time and now hundreds of dollars to spend on something with no guarantee of passing. I can’t speak for others, but I don’t have the same following as you or some others who have submitted proposals, and therefore there’s no guarantee my proposal will pass. In fact, I’ve recently created a Twitter account to try and make sure there are many voices being heard outside of this forum.

I spent a time drafting an initial community discussion and ideating, then letting it rest with the community, and then spending a significant amount of time drafting up a new proposal last weekend. I simply don’t have have the time nor will to push something that will change the NNS without confidence that I understand the implications.

From a developer’s perspective, this is like skipping the staging/dev environment and pushing straight to production. If the community really wants to move and push changes out fast, that’s their right - but I prefer to move slower and get more consensus. DFINITY does not move this fast with any of their design or feature decisions - if they did the IC would have many more problems than it does today.

If you read my proposal with the incubation period, there is some agreement after a back and forth discussion and now there’s a push to find the right UX to support this. This means I have to lay out a basic UX vision for how I see this working out (I am not a UX designer, so this takes some time). I also have a grant project and other life responsibilities and am not in a hurry to rush a proposal that I do not feel is ready.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-23 05:44:04 UTC | #56

You are right.  It’s important for you to take the time you need to feel comfortable and confident about the proposal.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

@LightningLad91 @skilesare @Roman @willguest @justmythoughts @Kyle_Langham @levi @Hashimoto @kusiyo 

So who here is willing to give @wpb  1 ICP each to submit a proposal to revert the NNS to originals proposal reward settings. Tabula Rasa. There is a chance it wont pass but if it does we remove a now large weak point in the NNS. I think that is the best solution for now until we find an effective spam method (The 10 ICP reject cost proposal will be an effective temporary deterrent for now.). From what I have seen I know many of you have come to the same conclusion. Motivating individuals to vote on governance proposals is a worthy cause but we should take a step back and find a solution that does not directly change core mechanisms in the NNS. It seems to be very finely balanced and its core mechanisms did not have any issues before we introduced our changes.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-24 00:28:56 UTC | #58

You’re proposing that we revert the governance weighting back to its original setting? If so, then I would donate 1 ICP for that proposal.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-24 01:33:34 UTC | #59

I would donate 5 out of my personal account.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-24 04:42:10 UTC | #60

I am taking a different approach.

 I will be actively participating in crowd-funding a fund (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-56430-internetcomputer-org/12382/3) to generate spam proposals ; so as to show how ineffective it is to increase the rejection cost by a factor of 10 (1 icp -> 10 icp).

We NEED to figure out a method to filter out the spam proposals.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-04-24 16:24:33 UTC | #61

I would also participate, but if Dfinity does not vote, it will not pass, because people got used to earn doubled rewards. The problem is : Dfinity also voted for the increasing of rejection fees. Still, I am perfectly fine about sending ICP yes. Maybe we can wait a moment, to give to Dfinity the time to see that the problem stays the same. I agree with the fact that initial settings were the most balanced. We had not had any spams problem with these ones.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-24 07:14:03 UTC | #62

From a mathematical point of view (the one used by @ysyms to justify spam), raising the cost doesn't solve the problem, just squeezes the profits. Their later claim was that the cost would need to get to something like 2000 ICP to be successful.

If it's 10 ICP, I cannot afford to risk putting my own spam inhibition proposal forward.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-24 12:40:19 UTC | #63

Have you considered that @ysyms now has the perfect setup for the best rug pull in ICP history if they achieve raising 600 ICP in the crowdfund campaign.  They could take the money and run while leaving in their wake even more motivation by the community to address the spam for advertisement and announcement issue.  

Spam for financial gain will be fully solved by proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).  @ysyms is capitalizing on the fact that it will take time for it (or something else) to be implemented.

Whether or not @ysyms carries out the plan for this crowdfunding effort, they will go down in history as the most effective influencer of action by the IC community on this spam topic.  (Unless @ysyms is actually a whale,) this self proclaimed high school kid stands more to gain personally by not executing the plan after receiving the funding.  Any whale that stands to gain from spam proposals can submit their own proposals.  It doesn’t require @ysyms to do it.

FWIW, I think @ysyms is brilliant and has perfectly executed a strategy to motivate the community toward action on the spam proposal topic.  Some day I’d love to know if it was fully planned from the beginning or if the strategy developed as the community responded.

Edit: Hey @ysyms I see you have raised your crowdfunding goal.  Congratulations.  If you carry out the plan, would you please continue using a generic proposal title (e.g. Test_011) so it is easier to visually filter out actionable proposals among these crowdfunded proposals when scanning proposals in the dashboard?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-24 15:29:52 UTC | #64

Yes, the potential rug pull issue is definitely at the back of my mind. I judge people by their follow through. Based on what i have seen of @ysyms so far, i have reasonable confidence that he/she will follow through on his commitments. 600 ICP is not particularly big amount in context of the circulating supply.

To me bigger exposure is the context of crowd funding per se(not necessary just limited to spam) and it's power. Seems IC is particularly tuned to harness this power. Secondly , as we know from systems design, changing some parameters in a complex system, can have unintended consequences elsewhere. We should keep that in mind as we begin to really mature in our thinking.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-04-24 16:38:22 UTC | #65

I think we should start with one or two month period and then increase the duration gradually.

As for the spam, please consider reverting the voting reward changes that was initially intended to increase the manual participation for decentralizing NNS. After that, new voting incentive and proposal models can be discussed by the participants.

Edit: Reverting is damage control not perma fix
