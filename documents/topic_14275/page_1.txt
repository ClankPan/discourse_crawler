If we added Governance back to All Topics, then DFINITY would not be able to vote on any Governance proposal because it would execute liquid democracy of all voting power in the NNS.  It would look and feel very centralized and would move us in the direction of being more at risk of ICP being in identified as security since we would all be profiting from the efforts of others (e.g. DFINITY) instead of by having to perform the work of governance ourselves.  It’s much more messy if that change is rolled back in my opinion.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-15 15:09:06 UTC | #103

True, it would mean more or less returning to the situation a year ago. But it would also create a sense of urgency to fix the central issue. Without that urgency, temporary rollbacks have a way of becoming semi-permanent... Anyway, the proposal as outlined by Dfinity will pass, all discussion now is academic.

Yep that's exactly one of my main concerns. Dfinity should put the SNS on the backburner and focus on fixing the NNS instead. As Psychedelic team said "focus on the protocol, not the applications"

Ysyms is also profiting at a level that is unfair to everyone in the ecosystem, he is doing essentially 0 work and made $8-9k up front this month by charging ridiculous fees. Supracompetitive pricing is inherently unethical and we should be voting yes to end this abuse of power on this point alone.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-15 17:15:15 UTC | #106

Agreed but there are ways to fix that, I'm working on a dApp to trustlessly crowdfund proposals. Only fee will be the one to keep the canister running.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-07-15 17:28:10 UTC | #107

That sounds awesome! But I'd like to end this here and now, I don't want him making 1,240 ICP per month any longer. Even if you launched it today, there might be 2-3 more months of spam from Ysyms before the people donating to him realize there is a 99.9% more efficient way.

Not a line anyone should want to cross, ownership is ownership and that has to be a constant for a blockchain to be trustworthy. It is dirty money but It's not our job to play judge and jury with peoples finances, that would be a governments job. 

However, there is nothing wrong with having a long memory, in case his name shows up again. On that note, nothing wrong with stopping further dirty money by voting yes on this posts proposal either. The APY has really gone to peoples heads.

I didn't cross a line and it is our right to vote.

Your inaction and protective behaviour is why dog boy feels he can do as he wants.

After giving it further thought, I believe that the spam is not harming the ecosystem and I would rather see a permanent solution implemented such as [55651 - Followee confirmation](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).  In fact, I think decentralization has improved based on the steady increase of total voting participation as well as the sudden increase that occurred when this proposal was submitted.  We have now Rejected 20 spam proposals by Absolute Majority because of this increased participation.  This is the first time ever that proposals have been decided by Absolute Majority when the initiating vote that executed liquid democracy was not cast by DFINITY.  This is happening without default following that was configured on all neurons in the first year after genesis.  I would rather allow total voting participation (and therefore decentralization) to continue to improve until a permanent spam solution can be implemented.

I know the DFINITY Growth team expressed concerns about the spam proposals.  Perhaps a message worth presenting to new devs should be that decentralization is improving, which should resonate with them.  Also, perhaps articles should be written for the DFINITY medium blog that state the real voting rewards that are being observed from governance participants.  The dashboard and the DFINITY articles still quote the annualized voting rewards as if all neurons were always voting.  This is misleading and perhaps an educational opportunity missed so far.  Why not publish the real data that voting rewards for the 8 year dissolve delay has been 35 - 45% for neuron owners that are voting and 5-10% for neuron owners that are not voting.  It seems that would have two positive results...attract new users and cause existing users to review their voting strategy.  Just like the articles that are published previously, this would not be a promise of voting rewards.  All it needs to be is a statement of fact along with educational information about how best to participate in governance based on the rules that are in place today.

dfisher | 2022-07-17 22:06:59 UTC | #115

I am all for long-term thinking vs. short-term gratification. That’s why I hesitated before voting on this one. We all want the IC to win out in the long term. 

All that said, in my opinion the downside caused by spam was much lower than the upside caused from incentives to actively participate in governance and increase decentralization. It’s important to remember we have a ton of whales through zone 2 (end of 2023) that are dissolving and I’d rather not have rewards go to them.

Moreover I was earning a much higher yield personally. I’m happy to sacrifice in the short term if I think I’ll ultimately be better of owing to a better system. I’m just not sure this proposal does that. 

And that’s why as a voting member of ICPM I was one of the 5 that voted no (but lost).

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-17 23:30:15 UTC | #116

Here is my view, as a voting member of ICPMN Neuron, about this proposal and why I voted, with no surprise, « yes ». **I precise that, as voting member, we all vote autonomously, so my position is only mine and not ICPMN’s one.** 

For the record, [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/using-randomly-assigned-neurons-to-filter-for-non-actionable-proposals-void/12114/29?u=roman) is the position that I had months ago. 

Now, to precise my way of thinking : 

In the first place, as the spam don’t provoke inflation, but just redistribute exclusively the rewards to the voters, the problem was obviously not about the fear of an inflation. And to be perfectly clear, if I had to choose, I am perfectly ok with the fact that voters have a rewards privilege. 

My concern was about the aspect of the NNS and more globally of the IC : we all aim to see the IC become one of the three first blockchains. For this, we can’t afford a governance with a messy/dirty looking. We need a governance registry where serious and rigorous proposals are not diluted among fake proposals just designed to make profit. If the IC must be continued keeping its current aspect, with daily spams (and we are lucky, as they could be dozens or hundreds a day), it won’t be considered as a serious blockchain. Even if this spam don’t cause inflation, it has a heavy price :  it could cause a brain drain eventually, as such proposals make our governance system look like not serious, since it could appear as a system whose a simple high school student can take advantage of, just to make money. 

A Top class blockchain can’t have such proposals as « ambassadors » of its governance structuring. We need to think about what a blockchain’s governance must look like to attract the most brilliant spirits of the planet (or at least to prevent them to see a blockchain as a not serious one) : the spirits who will create the dapps which will bring masses to the IC, and clearly, such a blockchain’s governance does not look like ICP’s current governance proposals.

A couple comments on this statement:
1) Do you think the issue has been fixed? Cause to me this looks only like a stopgap that will make it less urgent for the foundation to prioritize a true solution.
2) We only "fixed" the good aspect of spam proposals, boosted rewards, anyone can still submit questionable content and make the IC look bad in the public eye.
3) Those who voted yes accepted to sacrifice boosted rewards for active users and a staking incentive for potential newcomers in favour of VCs to fix the issue only apparently, possibly further delaying a fix the community already voted for **months** ago, doesn't seem like a smart move in my opinion. 

>as they could be dozens or hundreds a day

They could but there'd be no monetary incentive to have that many, infact this proposal doesn't stop anyone from submitting spam 100 proposals if he wants to spend enough ICPs.

I disagree on the description of the situation as a sacrifice : people initially decided to stake with known rates of staking. The maximum was supposed to be globally around 32%, at the genesis, and to decrease gradually. So even if it is dynamical, we were supposed to be hoping an ATH rate of 32% a year. Months later, we suddenly felt to around 20,6% (in December), and people were very upset. After that, began the spam, and active voters got used to daily get more rewards, but they should not have got used to this, as it was an abnormal situation. But now, some days, when people « only » get 0,09% of rewards rather than the 0,11% they are waiting for, I read « why so low rewards today ? » from them. But the rate of reward should be 0,06% a day currently. The abnormal rates became normal for a lot of stakers. But it is not. Such rates of rewards have never been promised and to my opinion, if newcomers don’t come to IC eventually because they won’t get 35% of rewards, good for IC and us. Anyway, to me, the success of IC won’t come from the quantity of stakers, but from a massive adoption thanks to massively used dapps (as having ICP staked is not necessary to use the IC). 

Lastly, I don’t get why you see the adoption of this proposal as in favor of VCs, so I can’t answer about this point. But please, précise your point and I ll answer if I can.

But again, this position is only mine and doesn’t necessarily represent ICPMN’s one.

IC is not a serious blockchain if dead people are still voting and can make a difference for a proposal to pass or not.  This is way worst than spam.  I can only imagine IC detractor from other blockchain posting and trashing about this unbeliveable fact.
Way worst if one (or few) of those was a whale with millions of voting power.

Proposal 55651 has to be implemented as a priority ASAP to my opinion.

Thank you for providing your explanation @Roman.  You are one vote out of 12 voting members for ICPMN, each of whom are asked to consider each proposal objectively, vote with our individual convictions, and provide a summary explanation to the community for why we voted how we voted.  You have done an excellent job of providing this feedback.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-17 23:40:09 UTC | #121

Thank you @wpb. And I think really important to insist, as you did, on the fact that this vote was almost maximally splitted (7/5), so the purpose of decentralisation of ICPMN’s neuron is fully satisfied.

-------------------------

Monkeycruise | 2022-07-18 03:05:05 UTC | #122

I am 1 of the 12 voting members for the ICPMN Neuron and I wanted to share my thoughts and reasoning for how I voted on this proposal. I admittedly was torn for some time on how to vote on this particular proposal. The spam proposals, although extremely annoying in nature were indeed showcasing the need for a solution that prevents the current incentive to attack the governance mechanism for the Internet Computer. Eventually, I landed on personally rejecting this particular proposal due to the fact that in my opinion this proposal is by no means a long term solution to the problem exposed here. Furthermore, a big part of my decision was an attempt to represent the communities best interest for the future of the eco-system and for many their investments into their futures. My rejection of the proposal was not because I believe the current state is the right state; but rather the proposal lacked the ability to pragmatically solve our current state for the long term in a meaningful way. Although, the vote did not align to my own personal vote to reject the proposal I confidently stand behind the collective decision the ICPMN neuron made. I am privileged to be amongst 11 of the greatest ambassadors and minds who represent various community members within the IC. Our split vote represents our groups ability to operate based on our own personal convictions whilst always keeping the priority on improving and representing the community.

I can't speak for the VCs, but I did a bit of analysis on the seed round investors.  About 2/3 of the top 50 investors have set the majority of their 49 neurons to dissolve. Every month you can watch the transfers to Coinbase and the subsequent market sells.

This proposal just means that the latter 30 out of the 49 will have more ICP to dump on the market.

I think the DFinity team overestimated the loyalty of the people who bought in in 2017 sadly. Not saying spam is a good thing but it did have the handy side effect of moving ICP from people who were going to dump it anyway to the long term holders.

Maybe we just need to let these people dissolve all their Neurons for a certain amount of pennies on the dollar and get it over with.

-------------------------

[quote="Roman, post:118, topic:14275"]

[/quote]

So lets say you've got a hypothetical whale with 1 million ICP locked up, and this proposal reduces the APY (roughly) from 40% to 20%.  That's 200,000 ICP a year less for that whale.

That's 547 ICP a day in rewards that is redirected from the whale to people who absolutely don't care about the network, and are probably dumping their tokens every month.

I think somebody worked out that one spam proposal per day (at a weighting of 20) would be a 60% or so increase in rewards.  If this whale spent 200 ICP a day on spam proposals (10 ICP * 20 proposals), he'd make > 300 ICP.

Now that's just one guy (edit: or girl) who owns 0.2% of the overall ICP.  Get a few of them together and it starts to make a lot more financial sense to spam the network.

The issue with voting yes on this proposal is that it doesn't fix the problem, it makes it worse.

1. It reduces the incentive for people to lock up ICP as the APY is halved, which puts downward pressure on the price.
2. It moves ICP from the people holding to the people dumping, also putting downward pressure on the price.
3. It doesn't even fix the problem!

EDIT: "Price go down" is bad for us all, not just simply due to the greed of an individual, but at some point Dfinity (now 270 people) will sell their ICP to pay salaries.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-18 10:03:56 UTC | #127

I agree with you on the principle and I have always been.

So, to explicit my thought when I wrote this : *de jure* the problem is not solved, because such a situation as the one you describe is still possible, but *de facto* the problem is solved, because the probability that such a situation occurs is very low ; so much lower than the probability of someone spamming the NNS with a weight of 20 for governance proposals anyway. 

So, of course, I never thought that the problem was absolutely solved, cause, again, by principle, we could figure some situation with massive whales or organisations of a lot of little neurons to run a spam campaign.

We have to recognize that such spamming campaigns were not existing before the rewards weight modification. I does not mean they won't exist anymore once the changing implemented, because now, people have begun spam and it increases the probability that some people continue this effort, but again, the risk is far lower than with the current system.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-18 10:03:15 UTC | #128

I just don't think it reduces the chance, it's just a numbers game and the spam proposals can easily be automated.

Yes, there's a chance that the people funding the proposals have 0.01% of the ICP and this will make the spam not cost-effective to carry out.  When a group that owns 0.2% of the ICP can collude to make profit (and the more collusion the more profit per individual), that's a low bar to entry.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-18 10:07:49 UTC | #129

In an automation case, you would be right : we would have done a terrible mistake. But to be honest, only very few people currently make proposals for ability/will reasons, so I have doubts on a sudden emergence of such profiles. But let us be clear, I am agree with you on that risk and on the fact that it would make the NNS look worse.

Maybe the price action made a few people change their minds.  Certain individuals dumped all the way down from $500 to $5, and were still being rewarded with bonus ICP for doing nothing other than hurting the platform they invested in.

I just don't want to see 100s of spam proposals per day, so I hope you're right hah. May have to invest in a new mouse as a hedge.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-18 10:16:04 UTC | #131

About this unfairness and willing to reward specifically active voters, I agree with you. I see a lot of people claiming that they are 8 years gang and that this proposal is unfair, but IMO, to reward 8 years stakers, we should use a proper proposal about VP and rewards rather than making it collaterally with a proposal which was only designed ti increase decentralization : the difference of weight.

So, to favorise the 8 years stakers, we just more simply can cast a proposal about this : @wpb, @Kyle_Langham and @ayjayem made a beautiful proposal about this months ago. Wenzel also proposed a new model of rewarding when started a discussion about offering to very short stakers a reward too. So, I deeply agree with you, but we must fight this problem properly rather than drifting it from a proposal whose the aim was different.

I think this is a good point that is not discussed very much because it’s difficult to recognize.  Most maturity from voting rewards has not been minted by either merging or by spawning.  It is still sitting in neurons.  All dissolving neurons are earning maturity.  For seed investors who don’t care about the ecosystem and have never participated in governance, there will be more ICP minted from their dissolving neurons than what is known to be staked in those dissolving neurons.  Every month for the next 3 years it will increase each month because of high voting rewards earned by default following.  Spam and higher proposal weights did redirect those rewards to active governance participants, which is the intended purpose of the tokenomics.  Perhaps it will now become a higher priority to implement proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) so followees are selected by choice instead of default and everyone who is collecting voting rewards meets a minimum threshold of active participation in governance.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-18 18:41:56 UTC | #134

So, could it be that Dfinity insiders who were seed round participants want to roll back the enhanced rewards for governance because it led to active members gaining through spam proposals at the expense of those insiders with dissolving seed neurons? Sounds more plausible than the idea that we need to roll back because new investors looking at the NNS would be put off by spam proposals and conclude that ICP is a joke blockchain. I think it is imperative that governance votes be rewarded better than admin votes. Let's see how long it takes Dfinity to bring back something the community voted for enthusiastically.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-19 07:58:01 UTC | #135

No, don't think that's anything to do with it. Every active voter gains from this spam. The people losing out literally have no interest in ICP other than selling it.

I know a guy with 2 million ICP who hasn't done anything with his neurons so far because he doesn't have the time to sit down and work it out.

Let's just see what % of ICP is staked into long-term Neurons following this change.  I'd expect the amount to be cut in half.

-------------------------

DavidB | 2022-07-19 12:53:34 UTC | #136

Sadly I only saw this discussion now. My Neuron is following someone who voted Yes and I can't change the vote either now. 
One reason I just locked up 2 weeks ago a lot more ICP was the higher APR which will be reduced via this again.
Anyone who thinks it takes too much time to vote on these can just follow some other neurons.
I also didn't see a single calculation if it's still viable to just submit now 10x more spam proposals. It will reduce the rewards for the spammer due to more costs but not even looking at this possibility and having next month not 5 but  50 spam proposals seems like an oversight. 
Looking at the votes it seems a lot of people who are actively participating voting no and the yes votes are mainly blindly following without expressing their real opinion. 
If you boil it down you ask people to skip ~20% APR vs not to have to click some more for the few big neurons people are following. The idea in the beginning was to reward active folks more which is happening right now.
I wouldn't be surprised if this results in a lot more spam to get the higher APR never the less.

-------------------------

DavidB | 2022-07-19 12:58:35 UTC | #137

Quick add:
Having 1M ICP locked for 8y in a neuron getting 20% more APR via this makes it viable to Spam 54 proposals per day.

Guess what, you could have if this proposal had been implemented: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985

But apparently Dfinity would rather prioritize tax evasion for VCs than basic voting features.

It also didn't help that this proposal has been submitted a couple days after it was initially presented and ICMN voted a bit too soon, they could have waited last minute to make sure nobody's vote was "trapped"

I don't think there is much to see, the proposal literally lists "How to avoid incurring a tax burden" as one of the issues it is trying to solve. Now do I think merging maturity should be a taxable event? No, but deliberating proposals **hoping** they might help avoid taxes isn't a good move for a decentralized project and prioritizing said proposal over much more important stuff just seems ridicolous. 

Here is what it looks like from an outside prospective: "Hey you know ICP, that project that did nothing but dump for months and is commonly accused of being a VC pump and dump? Yeah the foundation proposed to change the protocol because a seed investor had issues with taxes and they are prioritizing this change over critical DAO improvements". People think spam proposals make Dfinity look bad, when they are nothing compared to stuff like this.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-19 13:54:23 UTC | #141

I agree but what you, me and Dfinity think as if rewards are  taxable or not does not mean anything.  What is important is what IRS or other government think and do about rewards.  This is why, for a minimum, they should have seeked an advice from a professionnal tax firm.
But beside this, agree 100% that Dfinity has no business in tax management for anyone.

Might be a bit tight to propose a new version this week but, it's implemented and now it goes to test.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-19 22:24:46 UTC | #143

ICPMN voted exactly 4 days (96 hours) after proposal 70015 was first submitted.  The minimum voting period on all proposals is 4 days.  We provided all the time that should be needed.

That said, I fully agree that implementation of proposal [38985](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) would ensure that everyone has a chance to change their vote if needed after their followee casts a vote.  It’s not practical for public neurons to wait until a specific time to vote.

When I think about any proposal I like to vote what is best for all of us because I wanted to get away from the Top Tech Centralized systems where One is in control and I felt that Decentralized would be much better but all I have found is many Centralized opinionated people.

Does it matter how many tokens any of us have? 
It is my right to do all those marked under Decentralized.

Most of what I see here is about changing the NNS to reap more rewards for yourselves and justifying it because they follow the rules or have too many tokens. 

If you make the changes you want here are you not alienating and the cause of neuron owners wanting to leave with all of these trite messages that are harped on with over and over.

Have you nothing to contribute that would give us something to vote on that would further the NNS.

If you didn’t have these Trite complaints then wouldn’t you be nothing more than **Bystanders** which is less than a Follower.

When is this implemented? I still see spam

Update: there was a new version proposed and the PR that makes NNS-dapp UI allow vote regardless if proposal is declined or accepted, as long as the duration is valid, is live 🎉

The filter "Hide "Open" proposals where ...." inherits also this improvements - e.g. if you select proposal status "Accepted" and "Rejected" and use previous filter, it displays the proposals to which you can still vote.

Late to the discussion/proposal but had a thought of couldn't we have done the opposite and increased the weight by more. It would help reduce spam as the incentive would drop off at a faster rate, so potentially you might be able to get it to so anything after 1 would not have a significant enough reward. And this could have a chance to not reduce the rewards of those voting and only reduce the spam.

But guessing there's some ripple effect with this approach?

@bjoernek @Manu 

This proposal ([70015](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70015)) reducing the governance vote weights passed a two days ago, but I'm still seeing the reward weight for new NNS proposals at 20.

See [Spam proposal 71207](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/71207), for example.

From [this GitHub commit](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/b4a4fbcb9e7dc2f8d9bdf33e5675733f1479aa49), it looks like the code change for the "tactical fix" was completed and merged into the main branch ~5 hours ago (as of this post).

When can voters expect this committed change to be pushed out to the NNS?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-07-22 04:24:45 UTC | #149

I think a new replica binary is deployed once every few weeks (containing all code changes since the last deploy). I could be wrong though.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-22 08:14:46 UTC | #150

@justmythoughts: The code change is planned to be released early next week. 

@jzxchiang: And yes this is correct. We typically try to bundle changes over a few days and then release. For this one I am not sure yet if it will be bundled with anything else.

The incentive of garbage proposals comes from income. The four garbage proposals have maximized the benefits, and there will be no 40-100 items you mentioned. Please make full research. Unfortunately, the proposal was passed.

-------------------------

finethankyouandy1 | 2022-07-24 03:32:23 UTC | #152

An imperfect system without junk proposals is the biggest tragedy. There is not only one way to solve the garbage proposal. We should allow time to solve the garbage proposal, rather than being a nanny and always worrying about the damage of neurons that do not participate in governance. Self responsibility is the spirit and foundation of blockchain.

It is suggested to increase the weight of participation in governance and attract more people to pledge and governance, which will eventually solve the garbage proposal, but it will take time.
Your proposal was passed. It's a pity that the community made a wrong choice.

Tony89 | 2022-07-24 09:43:43 UTC | #153

If 4 spams per day, it also contributes to increase the reward and increase the inflation of $ICP to the market, affecting the price of $ICP.  need to sacrifice personal interests for long-term orientation.  Don't think there is spam you will have more % reward.  it will cause the supply of $ICP to increase faster and the price will go down.  It will also affect your assets.
so I've always been in favor of an anti-inflation mechanism.  so my vote for this proposal is Yes!!!
for me holding 10$ICP but its worth 1000$/ICP would be better than holding 1000ICP but its value is only 1$/ICP.

ysyms | 2022-07-24 12:16:01 UTC | #154

Proposal will not affect inflation rate

-------------------------

DavidB | 2022-07-25 08:37:51 UTC | #155

Like already mentioned this didn't effect inflation. It just shifted APR from non-participants (neurons not voting or without a correct configured following) to participants (neurons actively voting or following for governance voting). The overall inflation is in both cases the same.

bjoernek | 2022-07-25 20:04:46 UTC | #156

Hi all, FYI  the approved change on reverting weights of governance proposals back to 1 is planned to be released tomorrow. 

As discussed & suggested in this thread, we can monitor the spam situation post this release. If the spam is not sufficiently mitigated, we can consider further measures like increasing the proposal submission cost.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-25 22:36:37 UTC | #157

Thanks for letting us know @bjoernek.

@ysyms does this governance proposal weight change that will be implemented tomorrow affect your plans for submitting spam for the rest of the month?  I think the original goal of this proposal was to stop the spam.  Do you plan to stop after tomorrow, or will you be continuing until the crowdfunds run out?  I'm asking because the next step that was submitted with the proposal is to increase the proposal reject fee if the spam continues.  It seems reasonable you could just stop and keep the remainder of the crowdfund since they no longer have your intended effect.  That would prevent the proposal reject fee from increasing as well.

[/quote]

To be fair this would require a vote to increase the reject fee again. And it looks like in the previous 1->10ICP proposal the No was winning significantly until the Dfinity vote at the very end. To further increase the cost might have even more pushback as it will be increasing the barrier to submit a proposal based off of expendable wealth which feels like it would go against the push for decentralization.

Would Dfinity consider implementing proposal 55651 ASAP to fix the issue while simultaneously fixing other non sense issue like dead neurons owners still voting, inactive or lost account still voting and may change the course of the blockchain with their votes?

Does Dfinity made an analysis about the productivity as if it is more productive to deploy temporary measures to be reversed later on, thus loosing more time, than implementing the right one that was passed over 3 months ago?

I, and some others including @wpb , do not agree with the subjective asssesment provided by Dfinity about the proposale 55651.  To me personally, it looks more like an excuse not to implement the proposal.  I really hope I am wrong on this one though.  

Proposal is clearly way less work, way less harder to program and implement then the modulation proposal 48623. 

Transparency is really appreciated, when we have.

Hi @coteclaude, as analysed in this [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801), we would need to do some further design work on 55651 (Periodic confirmation of followees) before releasing it. In its current form it would not allow the roll-out of urgent hotfixes which we consider to be very important to keep the IC secure. This point was not considered during the deliberation of 55651 (and also DFINITY missed to point this out and consider this before the vote).

Can you elaborate on this, I don’t quite understand your point? 

The governance participation rate is > 50% VP, which shows that voters are quite capable of reconfirming/updating their neuron follow choices every so often.

Sure, I am happy to provide further context!

The concern is that it currently takes several days to reject or approve governance approvals (and sometimes even the full 4 days plus wait for quiet given that we are just on the edge of having governance voting participation of more than 50%). 

Periodic confirmation of followees would lead to similar voting participation on non-governance topics. If a really urgent update is needed (e.g. update of a subnet), waiting several days would pose a big security risk. Hence we do not recommend to implement 55651 without further enhancements.

How did DFINITY feel about this same issue last year when the overall voting power staked was much, much lower?

As this potential was not addressed in the original proposal until after it passed, it could be considered an implementation (technical design) detail. 

Has DFINITY taken any time to design or brainstorm any potential implementations to address their concerns? Or, since it was a community passed proposal did they expect the implementation and design to be fully baked/thought out and ready to go in the oven?


Also, does DFINITY expect the community to build their own solutions for community initiated and led (non-DFINITY) proposals that are passed through the NNS, or will DFINITY take on the part of implementing community led and passed proposals?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-26 16:03:26 UTC | #164

Thank you for your feedback!

I am not sure if I understand the question correctly. Given that we had default following for all topics last (governance and non-governance) we did not have a similar issue last year. Can you please elaborate a little bit more?

Yes agreed, if we can conclude on a small enhancement which makes this work, then we could consider this as an implementation detail. 

And yes, we had a few brainstorming sessions within DFINITY R&D already on how to enhance this in a simple way. So far, we collected some good ideas (some of which were also touched upon in the forum) but did not find a quick solution yet. 

In terms of the way forward: As mentioned [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-prioritize-55651-periodic-confirmation-38985-manual-voting-over-48623-compounding-maturity/14461/26), we are fully committed to working with the community on a holistic spam prevention and voting enhancements after the major release of the SNS and suggest doing this in a new [technical working group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-technical-working-groups/11781) on governance.

-------------------------

rusty.scrivens | 2022-07-26 19:03:12 UTC | #165

could it be as simple as having a hotfix(or urgent proposals) follow category and so when the followees gets reset, it gets set to a default of following Dfinity on hotfixes?

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-27 13:35:00 UTC | #166

I agree, there are simple fixes to the problem. Maybe Dfinity only likes complicated stuff :)

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-27 14:27:50 UTC | #167

Thi is a brilliant and so easy solution.  Hope Dfinity will make a proposal for this.  It is getting too expansive for us to do now.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-08-15 14:44:47 UTC | #168

I will keep sending spam proposals if there is no other solution in September

bjoernek | 2022-08-16 10:45:42 UTC | #169

Hi @ysyms, we are going to establish a Governance working group, where we will also cover spam prevention (and for example discuss the proposal from @rusty.scrivens above). 

I think it would be great if you could provide input/participate in this working group! Short-term, as indicated by @wpb above, re-occurence of spam will most likely trigger an increase (or several increases) in the rejection fee.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-16 11:19:07 UTC | #170

Have we considered just not allowing any stranger with 10 icp to create proposals? Maybe only named neurons should be able to make proposals. This would incentives people to become a named neuron and remove spam. We would also need a way to impeach neurons. And we need a different mechanism for people to become named neurons as they would become gate keepers to their own competition.

-------------------------

chepreghy | 2022-08-16 11:09:57 UTC | #171

This doesn't help decentralization. Maybe you have a good idea for one proposal (ICP Jesse's electricity consumption proposal), but you don't want to vote on every governance proposal manually. In this case you should be able to submit the proposal without having a named neuron.

So you work with named neurons to do it. Jesse could reach out to @wpb and ask him to make the proposal for him through icpmn

ysyms | 2022-08-16 15:00:04 UTC | #173

Motivation for spamming proposals will quickly change from increasing revenue to urging DFINITY to implement other  plan and against lowering motion proposal weights or increasing costs to take away our high revenue

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-16 15:17:26 UTC | #174

You just proved his point, if I have to ask someone who is already "in" to make a proposal the system isn't decentralized.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-16 15:20:27 UTC | #175

Well then I guess we can’t stop spam 🤷🏻‍♂️

There are other ways to stop spam and even if there weren't i'd take that over more centralization.

So, I apologize to the community for that mistake that did mislead my vote. I like the idea of prefixing it in all caps haha Sometimes, I'll be surfing through the forum for so long that it can be very easy to overlook things towards the end of the session lol Little things like that would def. be a good fix to THAT problem haha we can solve that at the least haha
