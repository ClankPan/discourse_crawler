### Background

* As mentioned in an earlier [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-on-the-work-and-prioritization-of-the-various-features-planned-for-the-nns-and-sns/13639), there is currently no capacity in the NNS engineering team to work on changes to the voting protocol, which would be required for a holistic solution for spam prevention. And it might still take some time until engineering capacity is freed up.
* On the other hand, over the last few weeks there were growing concerns from the community and the DFINITY growth team regarding the current spam situation.
* In particular with respect to introducing new developers and users to the Internet Computer, spam is considered quite confusing.

### Proposal

* As a temporary fix, DFINITY suggests to reconsider the (earlier rejected) [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56798) to temporarily revert voting rewards weights for governance proposals back to 1.
* We are conscious of the fact that this has drawbacks with respect to decentralization, as it reduces the voting incentives for active participation on governance topics as described [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801). On the other hand, keeping the spam topic not addressed, hinders the onboarding of new dapp developers and users.
* Given the current situation and engineering capacity, we believe that temporarily reverting voting rewards weights for governance proposals back to 1 is the most pragmatic solution for a short-term reduction of the incentives for spam.
* Once the SNS functionality has been delivered, DFINITY will take on the task of proposing a more long term and permanent solution to the problem.

### Analysis

* The proposed tactical fix reduces but does not completely remove the incentive to submit spam proposals.
* This is because approximately half of the total voting power is not voting on governance proposals after the reset of default following of all neurons in Q1’22.
* Impact assessment: Assuming 4 governance (spam) proposals, 144 FX proposals, 10 other proposals per day
  * Currently: It takes approximately 110k staked ICP to offset the spam submission costs (4x10 ICP) with additionally gained voting rewards.
  * After the proposal: It takes approximately 920k staked ICP to offset the spam submission costs (4x10 ICP) with additionally gained voting rewards.

### Next steps

* Discussion in this forum.
* Submission of governance update by end of this week.
* If the spam is not sufficiently mitigated, we can consider increasing the proposal submission cost in addition.

Probably unpopular opinion but I'm against the proposed change:

- I don't believe spam proposals to be a hindrance to legit ones.
- Recently we haven't had many governance proposals anyway.
- Spam gives early and active supporters a nice APY boost, which is much needed considered the price action.
- Spam proposals combined with the current reward weights have helped increase participation in the NNS.

Considering it's not hurting anyone exception made for those who haven't had time to update their neuron settings in over 7 months, a group which wouldn't have received maturity anyway if https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651 were already implemented, I say it's better to keep everything as is until a TRUE fix is proposed and can be immediately worked on.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-11 23:26:15 UTC | #3

Also against the proposed changes
I see those spams as a temporary solution to reduce rewards to inactive voters, dead owner accounts and lost accounts in order to compensate the people who are involved in the governance.  It does not create inflation.   
When proposal 55651 get implemented, the spams will died by itself and will exit out those inactive accounts.
A lost account, or dead owner account voting and receiving revards is way worst then those spams.
Until 55651, I am fine with those spams beside the fact that it does not look good.  It is only a cosmetic issue for now TMO.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-07-12 06:27:14 UTC | #4

Just an FYI, I almost missed this thread entirely. It might be worth renaming the title (or prefixing it with [PROPOSAL]).

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-12 06:44:44 UTC | #5

Thank you and good point. I have included Proposal in the title.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-12 06:54:56 UTC | #6

Thank you @Zane and @coteclaude, I agree that for experienced users (like you) spam is less of an issue, as you understand the context. 

The perceived hindrance is mainly for new users and developers who are interested to join or already joined and are then facing a voting tab consisting of confusing spam issues. 

Concerns around that have been growing in the last few weeks and therefore it is suggested to bridge the time with a tactical fix until we have a strategic fix.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-12 11:27:09 UTC | #7

@bjoernek does the strategic fix be proposal 55651?
Would it take that much work to program and implemement?
I think this would be the permanent fix and solve everything at same time.
I am annoyed thinking the possibility that a dead owner account can vote (having configured his following before) and make a difference for a proposal to pass or not.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-12 12:24:22 UTC | #8

Hi @coteclaude, apart from the implementation effort, the proposal 55651 (periodic confirmation of followees) cannot be implemented as is (compare the assessment [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801)), because of its impact on the reactivity of the system. A further enhancement is required.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-07-12 14:22:03 UTC | #9

I think this will be a positive change for the network. I hope this proposal passes.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-12 14:53:05 UTC | #10

I dont understand how 55651 reduces the spam?  Surely the spam would just continue and those gaining from it would just gain more as neurons got unfollowed.  

Is it just jumping to the conclusion that people will do X because they are gaining a greater reward even though 50% of people aren't doing that right now.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-12 15:41:06 UTC | #11

Unlike most people in crypto, I am a big believer in the welfare state. Because opportunities clearly are not equal at birth IRL, and children should not be left behind for no fault of theirs. 
Crypto is not the same at all. Everybody who bought ICP knew rewards were based on voting. They knew the whole point of the rewards tokenomics was to incentivise active governance. All they had to do was click a few buttons every few months to ensure they maximised their own rewards. Am I wrong in any of these statements? If not, why are we so concerned about people losing rewards that we try to tinker constantly with the system to equalise it? As I recall, some time ago, we were trying to find a fix for somebody's grandmum's tax bill. I just don't get it. Maybe I'm missing something, could someone explain why Dfinity is acting like a crypto nanny state?

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-07-12 16:02:46 UTC | #13

You seem to be using the word crypto nanny incorrectly.  The point here is to Fix the defects and upgrade to make things better in the long run.  Currently there is only one person creating spam.  but if this is not resolved in some way to minimize spam.  He alone generated 4x spam per day.  So if there are 10 or 100 people doing the same thing, every day we participate in NNS administration will have 40-100 spam messages??  What do you think NNS will be like then?🤦🤦🤦

-------------------------

marcio | 2022-07-12 16:11:42 UTC | #14

So people don't think I'm always against Dfinity ( :slightly_smiling_face:), I do support this proposal as a temporary measure. 

We can even go further as to try to punish the spammers if they have locked tokens. It should be clear that the behaviour is not ok. (just create a proposal to scare them)

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-12 16:12:49 UTC | #15

It's not economically viable to make that many spam proposals, the difference between 4 and 8 daily proposals isn't that big in terms of reward, with 100 daily spam proposals the only benefit we'd have is more ICP being burned.

-------------------------

Avocado | 2022-07-12 16:42:19 UTC | #16

Every day spam proposals burn 40 ICP, with no effect on inflation. Note how much ICP is burned in cycles. There are days when this number is even less than 40 ICP. Spam proposals - not a bad source of deflation:D
Last months quite a lot of new ICP were blocked in NNS, the number of votes for Governance proposals is steadily increasing, which is positive. We are moving in the right direction. NNS is the heart of IC, we need to educate people, get them involved in voting. If they don't want to, why should we penalize active participants in favor of inactive ones?

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-12 16:47:40 UTC | #17

Spam NNS proposals, as Zane points out, are subject to the law of diminishing returns. Also, it is easy to reject spam proposals based on knowing the spammer. The increase in governance rewards was an important step for decentralisation. Otherwise, Dfinity would always be in charge because most proposals are admin related. Why roll back an important advance, even temporarily, when it is causing no real harm?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-13 00:07:17 UTC | #18

[Proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) is mathematically equivalent to submitting an infinite number of spam proposals every day without actually submitting any spam proposals.  Any neuron owner that does not confirm their Followees would have their Followee selections removed, which means they are at higher risk of not voting.  Any neuron that does not vote does not receive voting rewards.  The total daily voting reward allocation is fixed, but the allocation to each voting neuron goes up when fewer neurons are voting.  

Right now this is what is happening on the Governance topic.  People who vote are getting a bigger piece of the daily reward pie because there are a lot of people who are not voting (51% of total voting power) on spam proposals.  Proposal 55651 would cause this to happen for All Topics Except Gvoernance as well.  However, in that case people who vote would be getting all the daily reward pie.  There is nothing left to incentivize spam proposals.  

The point is that ICP tokenomics incentivizes active participation in governance and there needs to be some minimum level of active participation in order to receive voting rewards.  The only task that would be required is to re-confirm your Followees.  It’s like voting periodically for representatives in local or national government.  The drastic change in voting rewards for some neuron owners is intended to be a strong motivating factor for people who are not actively participating to start participating.

All that said, proposal 55651 will only eliminate the incentive to submit spam for financial gain.  The low proposal reject fee still enables spam for advertisement and announcement.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-17 15:38:44 UTC | #19

@bjoernek 

Edit: I have cast my vote to Reject this proposal.  This [comment](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275/114?u=wpb) below provides my explanation.

I’ll admit I don’t like this idea for all the reasons described by others so far.  However, I’m inclined to support it.  I think DFINITY is in the best position to know if the spam proposals are turning off developers and new users and I trust your judgement on how to best to grow the IC ecosystem.  I think attracting these people is in the long term best interest of the IC and this bear market is prime time to build and educate.  If the spam proposals are harming growth, then we need a temporary resolution.

I agree that the NNS team has higher priorities at this time, especially SNS.  In fact, there are many features that I really hope to see implemented after SNS including proposals [38985 - manual voting](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985), [48491 - neuron indexing](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491), [48623 - compounding maturity](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623), [55487 - sustainability policy](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55487), and [55651 - Followee confirmation](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).  These are all past proposals that were approved that arguably should have higher priority than the long term spam prevention.  When the NNS team finally has time work on the spam resolution, hopefully they will also focus on additional mechanisms to encourage active participation and a higher degree of decentralization, which we still need in my opinion.

If you are going to change the Governance topic proposal weight to 1 then I recommend you also change the Exchange Rate proposal weight to 1.  That way you completely eliminate any incentive for spam for financial gain.  There are days (usually weekends) when there are no subnet update or node provider proposals, which are prime times for submitting spam proposals if exchange rates continues to have a weight of 0.01.  If seeing 4 spam proposals every day is a problem for growth, then I would think that seeing 10+ spam proposals on weekends is also a problem for growth.  I’d rather see that incentive eliminated.  Since there have been no quality governance proposals that have been submitted recently, there is no advantage for the governance proposal weight to be significantly higher than the exchange rate proposal weight.

Of course, taking away the higher rewards (35+% annualized return for 8YG) that people have received recently because of spam is likely to turn off a lot of folks as well.  I wouldn’t be opposed to a significantly higher proposal reject fee at the first sign of spam for advertisement or announcement.  Perhaps a higher proposal reject fee will motivate someone with a brilliant idea to crowdfund the fee and work hard to come up with something that will pass.  After all, they will get to keep the fee if it passes since it must be staked in a neuron to submit the proposal.  That could be a motivating force to cause people to develop quality proposals.

@bjoernek 

Thank you for the prompt and thoughtful response. I 100% agree with and endorse this proposal.

[/quote]

To play devils advocate with my endorsement:

If this proposal passes and the financial incentives to funding NNS spam are decreased significantly, the current spammer could become outraged that his/her income stream has dried up and spam the NNS for some additional amount of time, potentially with much more harmful and/or abusive content. 

On the bright side, eventually they will run out of funding - as even whales have limits on what type of content they’d support voting on in the NNS.

How would DFINITY and/or the growth team then view this situation? Would they be able to wait out the negative content due to engineering constraints, or would it become a greater priority?


[quote="Zane, post:2, topic:14275"]

I actually believe they are. I consider myself an “active” member of the community, but stopped paying attention to my proposal telegram bot b/c it was 4 spam messages every single day. (See my follow up question to @Kyle_Langham below).

[quote="Zane, post:2, topic:14275"]

This is in large part due to the increased [rejection cost proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increase-proposal-rejection-cost/12110).

The falling price action is unfortunate, but it should not be tied to NNS rewards policy decisions unless the security of the IC is at stake. We can have a discussion about ICP price in a separate thread.

I agree the rewards weights have increased voter participation - but is there any data that **spam** has increased voter participation? 

@Kyle_Langham, is there any data at DFINITY that would back this up, or show the current state of active (manual) votes cast versus passive (default) votes cast through followees?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-13 04:48:16 UTC | #21

Since the spam has started, there has been an increase in governance participation from about 46% to 49%.  As mentioned by @justmythoughts below, this correlation does not prove causation.  The trend is visible on the dashboard.

[/quote]

It’s very hard to correlate a 3% increase in voting power over several months with spam and to say it’s had a noticeable increase on voter participation. 

From the chart image you linked in your comment [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275/21?u=justmythoughts), it looks like there’s a near negligible increase and a few dips in participation along the way - I’d *eyeball* a 80-90% confidence interval of a +/- 5% change in voter participation over the last 3 months. Additionally as an engineer I’m sure you know there’s a big difference between correlation and proving causation.


There have been multiple other events during this same time including Supernova, many new projects/grants/developers coming to the IC ecosystem, and the price of ICP dropping (the ICP price dropping allows more ICP to be bought and staked, potentially resulting in an increase in voter participation) over this time. There’s so many changing variables - it’s a stretch to attribute the near negligible growth in voter participation to “spam”.

The informational campaign you ran in Feb-March had a much, much more significant impact on voter participation - one that could directly be attributed to the daily proposals you put forth and the +20X change to governance voting weight.

A proposal just like laws in the real world should be publicized and discussed on various platform, if a proposal doesn't get enough attention due to spam, then it's the proposer's fault, the NNS should be the final step where the community decides, not the complete process.

Could be, but I think it's mostly cause: 1) There isn't a topic important enough for the community to make a proposal 2) Even if there were Dfinity wouldn't implement it right away and eventually it might have to be re evaulated, e.g https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275/8.
Besides even with increased cost making as proposal now is cheaper in XDR compared to 7 months ago.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:20, topic:14275"]

[/quote]
Agreed, but keep in mind the current state of things is the result of proposals both the community and Dfinity voted for, there was no "allow spam proposal to boost APY" proposal, so reverting to a previous state which was deemed imperfect in the past to fix an "issue" the active community is actually getting a benefit from seems a dubious decision in my opinion and makes me doubt Dfinity's decision making.
If the current situation is considered so bad a temporary band aid is needed, why hasn't Dfinity considered this scenario BEFORE increasing weights? Why was it fine when they rejected the proposal to revert them just a couple months ago, but it isn't now coincidentally after someone makes a thread accusing Dfinity to benefit from spam proposals?

I get the impression at times Dfinity doesn't plan thoroughly when it comes to NNS/tokenomics and is too reactionary.

Yes, I agree that it would also be a sensible option to revert Exchange Rate proposal weight to 1. This was also discussed internally in DFINITY and (as usual) there are pros (this makes spammig even less attrractive) and cons (FX proposals are meant to be removed anyway and real governance proposals would get even less rewarded). 
Thus, I plan to submit the current proposal as is (so that the voting can start soon and I can avoid another syndication round) and I am very open to further measures like this next week.

Zane | 2022-07-13 17:35:21 UTC | #32

There is one thing I have never quite understood about rewards, say rewards stayed as they are but spam proposals disappeared, if there were no legit governance proposals for an entire year would the APY be lower?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-13 17:39:12 UTC | #33

Currently (due to Exchange rate proposals) we always have proposals each day. 

Once the Exchange rate proposals are removed, we indeed need a mechanism for dealing with a potentially unclaimed daily reward pot. Probably the easiest option is to carry over the rewards to the following day (otherwise we would create an incentive to submit spam on a day with no other proposals)

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-07-13 18:35:53 UTC | #36

I’m for this. Voting on the spam is a pain in my ass. 15 attention minutes a day from developers focusing on creating value is a negative drain on over all ICP price and screws up the signal to noise ratio of people trying to keep up. An temporary fix would be very welcome while we explore long term options.

-------------------------

Tromix | 2022-07-13 18:41:53 UTC | #37

Not my problem.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-13 18:42:30 UTC | #38

Connecting my ledger, merging maturity and voting on all governance proposals doesn't take me more than 10 minutes, which I'd say are pretty well spent considering they give a considerable higher APY boost.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-07-14 10:51:56 UTC | #39

@Zane 

Spending 10 minutes every day (for proposals that serve no purpose other than spam) multiplied by the number of developers on the IC is a huge waste of time.

If there are truly 1000 devs on the IC, that would be 10,000 minutes or 6.94 days of development wasted every day.

If we asked the citizens of their country to vote on ballot measures every day, but 95% of those measures were spam - everyone would grow complacent and either not vote, or just let someone vote for them.

The biggest danger to the NNS is people losing interest - you may be an exception, but the complacency with spam as the “new normal” is leading many of us to stop voting manually.

I commend @bjoernek and DFINITY for taking action to solve this issue, even if it is against their own short-term financial interests.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-13 19:04:36 UTC | #40

Thing is they dont have to, they could follow a named neuron for spam proposals and only vote when legit ones are submitted or if they don't want to follow anyone, not voting is also an option if those 10 minutes are too much and they'd rather spend their time doing something else.

If the IC will become a major player in the Crypto space, it's very much possible we'll get lots of legit proposals everyday and they won't be nonsense that only require a couple clicks, we'll have to either spend time informing ourselves and make a decision or delegate our vote to someone else, in practical terms not much would change from the current scenario so I see it as a non issue. The NNS already provide all the tools to let us decide.

I should be pissed cause I have to login daily and merge maturity manually on all my neurons, that is a waste of time, clicking a couple buttons to get a +5/10% APY boost not so much.


>or just let someone vote for them


Yeah that's literally how most countries work, pretending every single citizen to be informed and vote on all laws is nuts, the power of the NNS is we have the choice to vote ourselves if some topics are of our interest and we can immediately remove support to a party if they betray our trust.

If the IC will become a major player in the Crypto space, it’s very much possible we’ll get lots of legit proposals everyday and they won’t be nonsense that only require a couple clicks, we’ll have to either spend time informing ourselves and make a decision or delegate our vote to someone else, in practical terms not much would change from the current scenario so I see it as a non issue. The NNS already provide all the tools to let us decide.
[/quote]

I completely agree that people will and should delegate their vote - that is the beauty of the design of the NNS. There are detailed long term proposals that have been brought forth by the community for providing an easier UX for NNS voters in terms of making sure the proposals reach a certain threshold of support before they community is mandated to vote on them in order to receive rewards. I detailed such a proposal https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-introduce-an-incubation-period-and-minimum-support-threshold-for-governance-proposals/12220, and responded to this exact concern from @cryptoschindler about hundreds of proposals coming in a day [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-introduce-an-incubation-period-and-minimum-support-threshold-for-governance-proposals/12220/8?u=justmythoughts)

This being said, what you bring up with the NNS being flooded with legitimate proposals (that aren’t financially motivated) is a separate voter UX problem.

**There should not be a financial incentive for spamming the NNS - period**. 

(Or at least it should be very, very difficult to do so)

I should be pissed cause I have to login daily and merge maturity manually on all my neurons, that is a waste of time, clicking a couple buttons to get a +5/10% APY boost not so much
[/quote]

I agree with this sentiment. Auto-merging would be a big NNS UX improvement, but that’s for another discussion.

That being said, you forgetting to merge your maturity isn’t as big of a deal as missing a potentially critical vote on the IC.

bjoernek | 2022-07-13 19:57:37 UTC | #42

Yes I would expect that the foundation will vote also on this motion proposal. Since  [this update](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-approach-to-voting-on-governance-proposals/11845) the foundation usually votes on motion proposals.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-07-13 21:41:49 UTC | #43

We need something like TRIAS token. 
Trustworthy Reliable Intelligent Autonomous System.
I think the only way to achieve that is only by DAOs.
Temporary solutions are not reliable.
I have mentioned some time ago, how a proposal can be approved before submitted for a public vote but I see that nobody is interested.

The whole thing is doomed to fail.

-------------------------

Ori | 2022-07-13 22:47:30 UTC | #44

FWIW here I’m working on a tool that speeds up voting anyway, it’s a few weeks from release but I’m already using it myself and the spam voting is trivially quick now.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-07-13 22:48:37 UTC | #45

I also thought of the same idea, all proposals before voting on NNS need to be discussed and voted on forum a proposal can be approved before submitted for a public vote.

Wallstreetguy | 2022-07-13 23:21:18 UTC | #46

where is the Decentralization in that?

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-07-14 00:41:20 UTC | #47

Because of the follower system there is absolutely no benefit other then stealing from people who forget to follow. People are not active because the followed some one. This should be reverted

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-07-14 01:33:26 UTC | #48

Not true, I follow and active and not stealing as it is my right to follow

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-07-14 02:06:06 UTC | #49

The only benefits of weighting the votes to governance  is the ability to steal from people who unfortunately follow dfinity’s neuron.


The only reason we did is to improve active participation… well it’s not very active as everyone follows. Seems to me like we have a vanity metric to fill.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-07-14 10:13:13 UTC | #50

I enjoy how this topic quickly gets to the heart of the matter. It clearly shows the competing interests at work.

I will be voting in favour of the proposal because I see an overall benefit to the (future) decentralisation of the network.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-07-14 10:33:01 UTC | #51

I agree. Also why has it been over 1 year now and we don’t have a basic html form to submit proposals from community members? You want less spam?

Enabled the community to easily submit their proposals …. Not rocket science

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-07-14 10:35:40 UTC | #52

Disagree. The spam proposals can be easily distinguished and it should be part of governance

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-07-14 10:35:48 UTC | #53

It’s not active because there isn’t an easy way to submit proposals hence the one guy who has figured out how to do it is being vilified

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-07-14 10:38:43 UTC | #54

No one would bother to send in these so called “spam” proposals if there was a way for people to post proposals … it disheartening and very disturbing to see that people here don’t realize what the real issue is

Would you mind elaborating?

[/quote]

Fixing the spam proposal issue is quite simple:
1) Implement this proposal: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651

2) Require all governance proposals to go through a blind vote step: stakers have to vote whether they consider that proposal as spam or not, what others voted isn't shown and only those who vote as the majority get the rewards once the voting period ends (weight should be low but a bit higher than other topics), if the proposal isn't considered spam it's promoted as a governance proposals and voting proceeds as usual.

The "tactical fix" Dfinity proposed is just a way to hide the dust under the rug, active voters lose maturity in favour of VCs who haven't logged in the NNS for 7+ months and the true issue still persists, we might not receive increased maturity but bad actors will still be able to publish illegal/questionable content to the NNS. 
Temp fixes like this should be avoided at all costs, they only further delay true solutions by giving a false impression the underlying issue has been fixed.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-07-14 12:11:25 UTC | #56

There is literally a wiki article on how to do it. what are you talking about? Just because you don’t know how to use the command line doesn’t mean other people don’t.

No one is villifying anyone we are just over it, he made his point and now he’s just wasting everyone’s time. Take the weighted response down there is no benefit to it.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-07-14 13:41:10 UTC | #57

I am curious about what 260+ are doing everyday? Back to the original one just like a joke? Even do not have time to figure out a better solution if possible? If this is approved, the possible solution may be postponed for a long time? If so why not just think about a better solution and implemented it？

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-14 13:46:41 UTC | #58

It is kind of funny to take money away from VCs by clicking a few buttons though.

This proposal is actually bad for the price.  I've been watching the numbers and a lot of the daily reward is just locked back up into 8 year neurons.

-------------------------

Tromix | 2022-07-14 13:50:41 UTC | #59

I mean sure, I guess there’s competing interests. The reality of the matter is you have 3 distinct groups competing for resources.
VC’s, Dev’s, and public investors.

The problem at the heart of this is; 
Public investors are deep underwater. There is not a single public investor that is up on their position. Not one.

So the spam proposals offer a minor ROI for your public investors who’ve been thoroughly nut slapped through the god awful price action of ICP.

Naturally, you’ll start seeing more casual voices intruding on your forum now, myself included. I dont care about programming. I dont care about developing. Thats not my toolset/skillset in life. I’m here for the future promise of the tech.

That being said, I’m looking at the dev side of this, and watching you guys try to coddle the VC’s bags because its somehow unfair for them to miss out on spam gov proposal rewards as they arent active/dont care.

Fix your priorities.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-14 13:54:43 UTC | #60

Thoroughly nut-slapped by the exact group of people this proposal benefits... the seed investors that market sell their dissolved ICP every month.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-07-14 14:03:31 UTC | #61

It’s not bad for the price at all. You must not be out in the trenches where people are laughing at all the spam proposals. You think whale investors are going to buy into a protocol that can be gamed by a 15 year old troll?

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-07-14 14:12:26 UTC | #62

Omg there is a whole article about it? For command line? ROFL

Well with an attitude like that in the community we certainly aren’t going to be seeing $10 any time soon lol….

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-07-14 14:29:21 UTC | #63

You honestly think the real issue is that people are incapable of using the command line? Insanity.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-14 14:34:52 UTC | #64

Giving more ICP to people already hell-bent on selling every last one is bad for the price.

I don't think any whale investors appraising the technology would be put off specifically by a temporary protocol oddity that gives them a better ROI. Your average whale investor is probably just waiting for some dude in a baseball cap on Youtube to say ICP is better than Cardano.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-07-14 14:38:14 UTC | #65

Spam is expected in any system. The point you are missing is that what people want to see is an active community making proposals. Even some of the “spam” ones if you read them voice legit issues on occasion.

This proposal takes away what little incentive there was to make proposals for anyone who felt the need to read an entire article to do it command line :rofl:

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-14 14:39:21 UTC | #66

Where are these trenches of which you speak? In everything I have read, the major issue people have with ICP is centralisation. Increasing governance rewards made the network less centralised. Rolling that change back makes it more centralised. How turning back the clock on decentralisation will help price I cannot understand.

Also something important seems to have happened just today.  The active voting power has exceeded 50% for the first time ever.

This means that even if this proposal doesn't pass, the Foundation, ICA and whales could vote quickly to pass the 50% barrier so the spam proposals don't appear in the UX for new users.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-07-14 16:09:29 UTC | #70

nlh | 2022-07-14 16:21:42 UTC | #71

Hi everyone.
I'm just an average Joe so please be nice to me.
I honestly can't find 15'/day to go through and accept/reject all governance proposals let alone everything else. So I decided that I'll follow the Foundation vote.
Am I doing it right? I suppose that the Foundation will never miss voting any topic, won't they?
And what will be the financial implication of this proposal to an average Joe like me should it pass/fail?
Thank you.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-14 16:23:45 UTC | #72

If you follow the foundation on governance proposals your neuron won't vote, maybe this should be better communicated in the NNS UI, if you want to vote on autopilot follow another named neuron, e.g ICP maximalist or the neuron of someone you trust and know votes everyday.

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-07-14 16:29:52 UTC | #73

Thanks Zane for a very prompt response. Really appreciate that.
I didn't know that the Foundation don't vote on governance proposals. So I just added ICP Maximalist to my Following list.
By the way, is there any other neurons that I can "trust the most" to follow?
I find the current explorer is quite difficult to find essential information related to a neuron (such as how many votes have I/my neuron ever missed, how the maturity of my neuron has been grown, which neurons have voted the most, etc.)

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-07-14 16:33:56 UTC | #74

By the way, Zane. I just quickly checked (using the dashboard) and it seems that the Definity Foundation neuron that I'm following (neuron #27) DID vote on all governance proposals.
So I'm a bit confused. Correct me if I'm wrong on this please. Many thanks.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-14 16:34:16 UTC | #75

All named neurons are trustable in theory, I personally follow ICPMN cause it alignes with my ideals mostly and always votes on governance, other named neurons forgot to vote in the past. Other than named neurons I don't know any neuron worth following.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-14 16:35:49 UTC | #76

The foundation votes on governance proposals but if you follow them your neuron won't follow their vote, this was done months ago to make the NNS more decentralized and remove voting power from the foundation.

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-07-14 16:38:19 UTC | #77

Oh I got it now. Thanks a lot for the explanation. And yes, I agree 100% with you that this information should be clearly displayed on the NNS. Anyway I added ICPMN to my Following list now. Thanks for this & all the best.

First off, I absolutely love this phrase

[quote]
Your average whale investor
[/quote]


We know from Kyle’s analysis that a good portion of these VCs/seed investors set up default following or are missing out on the governance vote, which is where the inflated rewards (and spam incentive) are coming from.

A few months ago, @Kyle_Langham and @wpb  passed https://forum.dfinity.org/t/periodic-confirmation-of-neuron-followees/12109. This proposal should assuage the concerns of those like yourself and @Zane that feel wronged by investors who haven’t checked in since genesis. 

Implement this voter passed proposal that forces voters to periodically confirm their followees, and we should then theoretically end up with similar voting rewards (since inactive voters won’t re-confirm any of their followees and will miss out on not just governance voting rewards, but all other proposal rewards).

To conclude, this week’s governance proposal weight reset solves the issue of financially incentivized spam (by those same, “average whale investors” that sponsored @ysyms), and the periodic confirmation of default followees solves the other half of the equation, requiring a minimal amount of participation (once every 6 months) in the governance of the network in order to receive staked voting rewards.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-07-14 18:03:23 UTC | #79

This is incorrect. If you follow the DFINITY Foundation on the Governance topic and the DFINITY Foundation votes on a Governance topic proposal, the normal follow rules will apply.

What was done months ago was to change the setting *All Topics* to *All Topics Except Governance*, and for a period of time the DFINITY Foundation was not voting on Governance topic proposals. During that time, many neuron holders set up their neurons to follow non-DFINITY neurons for the Governance topic. That's still a smart thing to do, since there's no guarantee that DFINITY will vote on every Governance proposal even it does now vote on the vast majority of them.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-14 18:29:29 UTC | #80

I understand, I stand corrected then.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-14 18:40:50 UTC | #81

Thanks for the heads up.  I'm geeking out on this development.  We have achieved an Absolute Majority result on a Governance proposal for the first time since Simple Majority was implemented last year.  In fact, this is the first time ever that a proposal has achieved Absolute Majority where Dfinity didn't cast the initiating vote that execute nearly all voting power in the NNS due to default following.  This happened without default following!  It's a major milestone in my opinion.

This Tactical Fix proposal has attracted new participants to governance participation who were not voting previously.  Hopefully they will continue participating by either voting manually or by setting a Followee for both Governance topic and All Topics Except Governance.  Another way to solve the spam problem is for everyone to start voting on Governance proposals, so any progress in that directions is really good for decentralization IMO.

For anyone who is not aware, executing a vote by Absolute Majority does not mean the Voting Period is over.  It just means that no matter how many votes are cast it will not change the outcome, so the proposal is executed or rejected immediately.  The proposals circled in yellow are still accepting votes.  You still have time to get your voting rewards, so go vote and don't forget to vote on future Governance proposals!

If you are configuring your neuron with a Followee for the Governance topic for the first time today, then you need to vote manually for these proposals in yellow.  All neurons you are likely to choose as a Followee have probably already voted.  Hence, they will not vote for you on these proposals.  After you configure your neuron, your Followee will vote for you for any NEW proposals.  Go to the voting tab in the NNS dApp and vote for every Governance proposal.  Click the check box that hides proposals where you have already voted to make it easier.

wpb | 2022-07-14 18:33:14 UTC | #82

Following DFINITY foundation is a good choice.  They have not intentionally abstained from a vote in over 2 months and there are no current indications that they feel the need to abstain moving forward.  Make sure you have configured a Followee for both Governance topics and All Topics Except Governance.

kvic | 2022-07-15 01:07:22 UTC | #83

1. **Dead Neuron**
2. **Follower Neuron**
3. **Active Neuron**
4. **Spam Neuron**

**Dead Neuron**

The NNS has been updated to unfollow, following, neurons every 6 months.

Followers must reaffirm their following options at the end of this period else they will not receive any rewards.

This will remove dead Neurons from receiving rewards but concerns are that inactive users that are not aware of this change could result in a class action.

As neurons do not have any personal details there should be a campaign on coin retailers websites that purchasers of ICP tokens should be aware of changes to neuron holders rewards and they should login for important updates or lose reward entitlements.

**Follower Neuron**

The NNS should inform and remind neuron owners on login that they will have to re-follow every 6 months, else receive no rewards at all. That it is their responsibility as they cannot be contacted due to the nature of a neuron.

**Active Neuron**

Those who are active in voting should be able to follow and receive extra rewards for active voting twice on the same proposals.

**Spam Neuron**

Neurons that have an ID number below a threshold are team proposals and therefore trusted but neurons above that threshold are private and if rejected are automatically disabled from further proposal for a period of time but retain rewards that are then distributed to the community.

Most neuron ID's are under 100

Future same spam neuron ID’s rejected proposals could have an increased disable period.

Also spam neuron proposals should be staked for a minimum given period.

-------------------------

vavram | 2022-07-15 01:38:37 UTC | #84

Considering DFIINITY's insanely high voting weight, that makes the entire proposal a farce for DFINITY to decide the outcome.

Thanks for confirming it's a waste of time to vote on this proposal.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-15 08:34:47 UTC | #85

Rather than rolling back extra weightage for governance votes, would it not be better to roll back the requirement for stakers to reconfirm followees? All passive stakers follow Dfinity, and now Dfinity is voting on governance because rewards are too lucrative to miss. So, the simplest solution to spam is to undo the 6 month reconfirmation requirement so that all followees will get rewards irrespective of whether they reconfirmed or not.

Hi, just wanna ask (sorry if it's mentioned already somewhere above, but this got too large to read all) - does it mean that the [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) won't be implemented (although doesn't seem to be too excessive for engineering effort)?

For me in general:
1. I don't like rollbacks (mainly when accepted way forward seems doable)
2. I agree with extra rewards for active users (in the past I used to suggest even extra rewards for manual voting)

Are you sure?  I didn't vote on one of these and the option to vote no longer appears on the NNS app.  Does that mean I don't get any rewards?

Btw if the ratio goes back to 1:1 wouldn’t it still be economically viable for people to crowd fund the posting of 40 spam proposals each day vs just 2 to make up for the change??

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-15 11:21:05 UTC | #91

Apologies, I didn't know that. If it hasn't been implemented how come some people aren't getting rewards and others getting extra? After all, Dfinity votes each time, so its followers should all be getting rewards for spam proposals, right?

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-15 11:43:06 UTC | #92

The time didn't run out, the proposal closed when it hit 50% and my neuron didn't vote.  The UI didn't give me the option of voting once it had been rejected.

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-07-15 13:21:30 UTC | #93

Thanks wpb for the reply. I already made the configuration as you said. Cheers.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-15 13:43:50 UTC | #94

Yes, I'm positive.  If you can't vote on a proposal it's because the Voting Period ran out.  There have already been some that were Rejected by Absolute Majority and the Voting Period has ended, but also some that are still open for voting.  All Governance proposals can be voted for 4 days minimum even if they are Executed or Rejected by Absolute Majority.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-07-15 13:47:38 UTC | #95

Oh weird.  Let me test this again, would be nice to not miss out on rewards.

It could be a UI issue... or most probably PEBKAC.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-15 13:48:51 UTC | #96

There is no longer default following for the Governance topic.  Default following of DFINITY does still exist for All Topics Except Governance.  Hence, people who have not configured a Followee for the Governance topic are not getting voting rewards even though DFINITY is voting for Governance proposals.  People could choose to set DFINITY as their Followee for the Governance topic and then they would be getting voting rewards when DFINITY votes, but they have to take action to set up that configuration.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-15 13:50:43 UTC | #97

I would check the filters you have set for the Voting tab.  Perhaps you are filtering out the proposals that are Executed or Rejected instead of showing all proposals that are still open for voting.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-15 13:54:45 UTC | #98

Confirmation of Followee selection every 6 months has not been implemented yet.  That was a motion proposal that passed, but there was no code attached.  DFINITY would need to develop the code and then submit another proposal with code attached in order for the feature to go live.  This is not high on their priority list (roadmap) yet.

The UI only gives the option is the proposal is open and if there are neurons that can vote (code [here](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/27013c14e8b065873e4e84333d048485a94e30e1/frontend/svelte/src/lib/components/proposal-detail/VotingCard/VotingCard.svelte#L28)). It means that it should be improved by not considering the status but rather the duration of the proposal - i.e. the UI should allow vote regardless if proposal is declined or accepted as long as the duration is valid (cc @Manu). I just opened a task, we check it begin of next week.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-15 14:53:48 UTC | #101

Ok, so then that is what is preventing people from getting rewards. Maybe we should just roll that change back, since the aim is to ensure everyone gets rewarded as before, which will remove the rationale for spamming the NNS. 
Although, maybe that's not technically feasible. Thanks for clarifying, @Zane , @wpb
