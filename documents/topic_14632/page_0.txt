Both NNS and nuance are showing me the white installing screen. Dscvr opens fine.  I know a new service worker went out or id just wait to report it. 

iOS on safari and chrome, AT&T cell network in the US.

on my IPhone also had the same situation, but every time I quit all running apps and reopen it, it works normally.  I also don't know what is the reason?  Is it possible that the IOS operating system has a compatibility problem or is it because of the dapps on the IC???

It does the same thing for me when I try to launch these app from an article link. I can go on them directly though.

We have been getting reports of the same from our (Nuance) users. FYI.

@skilesare 

If you‚Äôre stuck on the loading screen and really need to get in, I‚Äôve found that waiting for a second or two and then refreshing the app once or twice (waiting a second or two after each refresh) allows you to eventually brute-force your way in past the bug.

@rckprtr and DSCVR/Taggr found the root cause and solution though üëè
