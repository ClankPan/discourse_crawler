Dear ICP Community,

**TLDR:** DFINITY Foundation will vote NO on [CBD Neuron](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52133).

## Background

The DFINITY Foundation (via its named neuron 27) has started to [vote on governance proposals.](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/27?topic=TOPIC_GOVERNANCE) Since the DFINITY Foundation is a critical player in the ecosystem, our long-term intent is to make a habit of explaining our rationale for how we vote in motion proposals, Foundation voting power, etc... for further visibility.

## Proposal in question

In this particular case, we will vote NO on Proposal [CBD Neuron](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/521533).

## We want to be clear in what this means and does not mean:

1. Foundation's default voting for voting is to REJECT any proposal it does not fully understand and agree with. In this particular case, Foundation is rejecting because [the creators of the proposal said it should be ignored](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-canister-builder-dao-cbd/11531/20?u=diegop) and a new proposal will be coming up soon.
2. We recommend any entities that want to be named neurons to look at the activity, community involvement and proposals by successful entities who want to be named like [ICP Maximalist network](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/42010).
3. Foundation may vote YES in a new proposal from CBD. This is only a judgment on this proposal.

**Please keep an eye out on an upcoming post from me on the Foundation voting power (22% of the network currently) and a list of all its neurons.**

Thank you everyone,

Diego
