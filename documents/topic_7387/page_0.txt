On the topic of colluding node providers, would it be feasible to revisit the the pay out scheme and maybe divide those into two flows in some way. One is a direct payment in newly minted ICP as today and the other is a redeemption mechanism of accumulated ICP. This could be seen as an insurance against collusion/corrupted node(s), if a node has been proven corrupted then the accumulated ICP will not be paid out and could be used in settling damage costs. Just an idea of altering the payments so it gets less attractive to operate on the dark side. 

Any other great ideas on how to fight potential collusion/corruption in the network?
