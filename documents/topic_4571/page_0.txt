Hi,
I wanted to the entries of an array but I get the following error : 
`type error [M0072], field sort does not exist in type`

I'm importing it with : 
`import Array "mo:base/Array";`

I tried with vessel to add the dependency like this : 
````
let
  -- This is where you can add your own packages to the package-set
  additions =
    [{
    name = "base",
    repo = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base",
    version = "dfx-0.7.0",
    dependencies = ["base"]
  }] : List Package
````

In the sources I see that there is no `sort`method in the Array.mo file.
I tried with version `master` but it can't compile because of Prim see https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/commit/0ecd07420362976f220514ae7f7b0b1f5008692d

What am I missing :frowning: ?

Try using a specific commit hash in the version field:

    name = "base",
    repo = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base",
    version = "6162dc91daabf57c6432e9080d66cf90e074f806",
    dependencies = ["base"]

````

I get this error because of Prim which is undefined. [Use import Prim "mo:⛔" · dfinity/motoko-base@0ecd074 · GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/commit/0ecd07420362976f220514ae7f7b0b1f5008692d)

Is your project using import Prim "mo:Prim"; anywhere?

-------------------------

I think the compiler version used here might be "old". I think you need to be using dfx 0.7.0, to have the new Prim name work.

@kritzcreek 
```
dfx --version
dfx 0.7.0
```

@Ori it's imported in motoko-base ine multiple files like `Int.mo`

Did you maybe lock down the `dfx` version in the project itself? `dfx.json` has a field called `"dfx"` that lets you set that.

-------------------------

anthonymq | 2021-05-31 12:04:15 UTC | #8

Yes I did : 
````
  "dfx": "0.7.0",
````

-------------------------

In that case you might need to wait for the next `dfx` release before you access `Array.sort` from base, sorry. Until then you could just copy the definition into your project as it doesn't rely on any unreleased features, and replace it with the `base` version later.

Alright, I'm using https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/quicksort/src/Quicksort.mo for the moment.
Wanted to clean the codebase but I will do it later. I was wondering if I was doing something wrong.
Have a good day,
Thanks
