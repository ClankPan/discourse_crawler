Has anybody gotten internet identity to work in React Native? I've gotten a simple app running with this example [https://github.com/decentralised-social/expo-rn-dfinity-icp-example](https://github.com/decentralised-social/expo-rn-dfinity-icp-example), but I can't find any documentation on integrating with Internet Identity.

The problem I keep running into is that @dfinity/agent and other related packages are built for the browser and so window.addEventListener() and localStorage are not supported.

This is on my near-term to-do list. We're waiting on security approval of a non-wasm BLS verification strategy, and then I'll work on an auth-client React Native example using Expo.

so its safe to say that there is no way i can link internet identity with react native?i actually wanted to make a mobile app with react native but i am confirming how to go about that first and see if its safe to continue @kpeacock

It's not impossible - it's just that we don't have an audited BLS verification strategy for React Native yet, and the example isn't ready. 

You could start developing your app today by passing `blsVerify: ()=>true` to your  H̶t̶t̶p̶A̶g̶e̶n̶t̶  
`Actor` , and you could use this native app example as a reference to build your app while we work on the BLS signature verification

I made this repo, maybe it could be helpful for you:

This is coming soon! We're reviewing the change to use `@noble/curves` for BLS verification. Once that's in, it will be really easy to use Expo with React Native.

I have a proof of concept with Internet Identity login for ios here: https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-expo-mvp

Full examples will come once we get `@dfinity/agent` released with no wasm imports

You can track the PR here: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/pull/817
