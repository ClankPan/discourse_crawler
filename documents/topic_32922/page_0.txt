Hello @MAIA, do you have an example of the model canisters that you currently calling in your backend?

Hello @jennifertran,

I have created a gist for the Brain CT Diagnosis flow with the latest updates. Additionally, I have included the model canister. You can view it here: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/tugberkserce/239365fe232aa6aa0a7846c88bb9c2d1)

Thank you for the Gist. It would be helpful for our public reviewers to understand how the model canister works.

This project is incredibly promising in AI-assisted medical diagnostics. MAIA's capabilities in analyzing various medical images and providing accurate diagnoses could greatly benefit patients and healthcare professionals. Here are two questions for further insight:

1. How does MAIA ensure the security and privacy of the medical images and patient data it processes?
2. What measures validate the accuracy and reliability of MAIA's diagnoses, and how are they integrated into the AI models' continuous improvement?
