The IC as a system is a pretty complex thing in the end and the documentation is probably one of the single most crucial pieces of information to bring in more devs. Can't we have a feedback button somewhere as many startups have on their landing page? I'd really use it a lot to point out inconsistencies or lack of information. In most cases, I would not bother to make a post here.

That's a great point. I will pass to @ais who is lead on the docs revamp.
