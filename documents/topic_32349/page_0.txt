I'm trying to create index canister for deployed (and blackholed) ledger canister.
I think icrc1_index_canister is properly configured, I downloaded .did and wasm.gz according to official tutorials. Also since index canister don't modify ledger canister - it's not problem with blackholing I guess?

Command:

`dfx deploy icrc1_index_canister --verbose --ic --argument '(opt variant{Init = record {ledger_id = principal "lnezh-4aaaa-aaaam-acrba-cai"}})'`

Error:

```
Deploying: icrc1_index_canister
Creating canisters...
Creating canister icrc1_index_canister...
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to register all canisters.

```

Seems a42pw-kaaaa-aaaan-ql62a-cai is wallet of my identity, but no idea why it doesn't exist anymore.

Ok I created new identity. Now works. Something went wrong with previous account. I thought it was problem with index canister itself.
