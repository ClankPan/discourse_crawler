Hello comrades, can you answer this question, thank you!
1. When motoko uses publish/subscribe to pass parameters between containers, is it possible for the "pipeline" to disconnect by itself?
2. If so, how to avoid it, or how to find out that the "pipeline" has been disconnected?
The official example doesn't seem to say anything about this.
Official example:

The only way I see that the connection could break is if one of the canisters makes a breaking change to its interface/code. The side that would then perform a call to the other side would see error messages like 'no such method' if the corresponding method was removed or 'deserialisation failed' if it now would expect different arguments
