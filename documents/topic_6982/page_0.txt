git clone the Ic-avatar tutorial and run,
`dfx start`
`dfx deploy`
I got the following error.
dfx -help does not have a subcommand generate.
What can I do to deal with this?
```
:ic-avatar $ dfx deploy
Deploying all canisters.
All canisters have already been created.

You’ll need to update dfx, v0.8.1 of the sdk added this command (it generates the bindings/type declarations for canisters, eg the .did and .did.js files). 

Release notes for v0.8.1 are here: [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/0.8.1-rn.html](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/0.8.1-rn.html)

Thanks! I just did this about a month ago and you've already updated it. I didn't know that.
