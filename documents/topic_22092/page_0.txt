Because, ckUSDT or ckUSDC will not be available till the end of this year, I decided to use this https://nowpayments.io/supported-coins/tether-payments#:~:text=Go%20to%20Store%20settings.,to%20accept%20payments%20in%20Tether! till then. 
However, do u think this is a safe alternative for now?
Goal: I want to create a wallet in which people can deposit from and external wallet like binance USDT then they can make internal transaction form user to another inside my website. Then users of course an withdraw to an external wallet like binance .
