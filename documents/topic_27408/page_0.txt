The [dfx version manager](https://github.com/dfinity/dfxvm) is now available for download.  It's essentially rustup for dfx.

Its purpose is to make it easy to download and use new dfx versions and to switch to between them as needed.

This is a soft launch, meaning it's available to download and use, while the current installation script still installs dfx in the same way that it always has.

You can install it with this command:

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/dfxvm-install-script/install.sh)"
```

We'd love to hear your feedback.
