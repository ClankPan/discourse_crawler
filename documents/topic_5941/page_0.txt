Is there anything particular which needs to be done to configure the IC to serve correctly a service worker script?

I get following error:

> The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html').
> service worker error DOMException: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope ('https://iey7l-kaaaa-aaaah-qadoa-cai.ic0.app/') with script ('https://iey7l-kaaaa-aaaah-qadoa-cai.ic0.app/sw.js'): The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html')

The issue is that ic0.app is already registering a serviceworker. Try accessing the site through `raw.ic0.app`

Thanks, it solves the issue.

Btw., if I may, what's `raw` or what's the difference, beside the sw, between with and without `raw`?

That‚Äôs it, really. Assets delivered over ic0.app are mediated by a service worker that checks that they are all certified assets before loading them. 

The use case is that a malicious node responding to a query call for an asset could send a falsified response, messing with your application. A certified asset comes with a certificate that is is essentially a merkel tree, signed using our chain key consensus mechanism. That way, you can get a fast query from a single node and trust the signature, even if you don‚Äôt trust the node. 

That said, the UX of the service worker is definitely slower and limiting, and the operations team is working on an alternate way to achieve the same level of trust through other means

Thank you for the explanation  üôè  All clear.

Glad to hear there aren't other differences. As we don't need that trust level with our app for the time begin, I'll then continue with `raw`. The boot time performance boost is quite impressive.

I wonder if the service worker can make use of local storage and load certified data from cache if their hashes didn't change. That will significantly speed up HTML5 apps when "Add to Homescreen" on mobile phones.
