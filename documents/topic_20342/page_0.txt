Version `0.24.0` of the agent-rs family of crates is [now available](https://docs.rs/ic-agent/0.24.0/ic-agent) on crates[]().io. The headline of the release is that the Rust agent can now be used from the browser via `wasm-bindgen`. This means that, if you wanted to, you can now write both backend and frontend without leaving the Rust ecosystem, using `wasm-pack` and a Rust frontend system like [yew](https://yew.rs/).

To add the agent to a Rust frontend project, add the following to Cargo.toml, under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
ic-agent = { version = "0.24", features = ["wasm-bindgen"] }
```

`ic-utils` will work in the frontend as long as the feature is enabled in `ic-agent`. Note that at this time NodeJS is not supported.

For more version information as well as past versions, see the [changelog](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
