I have seen the problem, we should reconsider the role of node providers, they are also investors, they also need to take risks, not full-time staff guaranteed 100% profitability, we hold ICPs have no obligation to support them!

You guys have been talking about this for days. How will a route be decided for one or multiple of these solutions? 
I see a bunch of great quick patches and overall  restructure of the chain solutions but when will someone submit a proposal? Then if dfinity is against everything being discussed here then there’s no shot in fixing these underlying problems.
Or are you guys just waiting for Dom to show up and give a response on his opinions cuz that’s unlikely.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-14 11:46:39 UTC | #110

While it’s not likely Dom gives his opinion on this topic, it’d be great to have some degree of feedback regarding solutions from the foundation, given they’ve designed these mechanisms.

With that being said, I’m personally waiting for a consensus to be reached on the forums before creating a proposal.

I like the following
voting rewards being locked to the neuron is fully dissolved idea. 
Increase of transaction fees
Either remove unused node providers or have a fixed rate of icp that can be earner or decrease the amount of rewards they receive. 
According to this thread node providers receive basically a 2x every month guaranteed so maybe decrease the rewards or a fixed monthly pool where the node providers get paid out based on how much they were used that month. 

Voting rewards being locked til fully dissolved will remove a lot of sell pressure.

I really like the idea of adjusting rewards based on usage. I've been mulling over a cool space ship metaphor to understand this better, and this is what I've come up with.

If we liken our network to an advanced starship hurtling through the cosmic void, we quickly realize that its survival depends on a harmonious balance of systems: propulsion, navigation, life support, and so forth. Each subsystem functions in an inter-dependent cycle of energy conversion, resource allocation, and dynamic responsiveness.

**Propulsion: The Inflation Dilemma**

Let's start with the crux of our problem: inflation, or in our starship terms, the 'engine thrust.' We aim to reach optimal velocity without overheating the engines or expending too much fuel. The challenge is to modulate thrust (token minting) so as not to lead to thermal runaway—akin to the risk of our engines exploding or propelling us into an uncontrolled trajectory.

The central issue we're facing now is the looming risk of inflation—or, borrowing from our metaphor, thermal runaway. Just as thermal runaway can damage a system by allowing it to become too hot, excessive token creation can dilute value, reducing the "energy" (value) each token can contribute to work. To counteract this, we could implement safeguards akin to thermal cutoffs, where the token minting rate is dynamically adjusted based on system demand, much like how a heat engine adjusts its fuel intake.

**Navigational Systems, The Ship's Officers, and Bridge Crew: Governance**

To mitigate unintended consequences while altering the core engine thermodynamics, we need robust feedback mechanisms. If we're dealing with an intricate vessel, the feedback loops act as governors or regulators that adjust the system parameters to prevent failures. In a similar vein, governance decisions should be tied to real-time metrics, offering a 'live' view of how changes in node rewards or transaction fees affect the overall "thermal equilibrium." 

The question of node provider costs, isn't just about minimizing outlays. The reports ought to include information on how much 'thrust' (computational value) each 'engine' (node) needs to align our vessel on the desired trajectory. This forms a crucial part of our thermodynamic calculations. These node providers should be remunerated in a manner that's directly proportional to the computation need from them. While all nodes should be compensated enough to at least break even (keep the engine warm), nodes that aren't needed to perform as much work shouldn't be getting the same amount of 'fuel' as nodes that are running at maximum capacity.

To achieve this, automated reports need to be generated, and a team needs to be assembled whose job it is to conduct continuous in-depth analysis of the financial state of the network and then assemble periodic (say, weekly, bi-weekly, and/or monthly) reports for the voters to read and base their decisions on. Small changes can be automated, similar to how the network automatically adjusts cycles cost based on XDR, while larger changes can be deliberated upon and put to a proper vote.

**Life Support and Mess Deck: User and Developer Onboarding**

The life support system is essential for keeping the crew alive, and a welcoming environment on the mess deck is crucial for crew morale. This isn't just about keeping the air breathable (simplifying onboarding with better documentation and tutorials); it's also about making sure that the onboard environment cultivates innovation and growth (through educational programs, grants, and hackathons).

**Shields: Transaction Fees and Service Costs**

Just as the starship has defensive shields to guard against cosmic threats, the transaction fees and service costs act as protective measures, creating an economic boundary that filters out 'spam' transactions or low-value contributions. These shields can't be too strong, or else they could obstruct important supplies or allies from coming onboard (deter new users and developers). Too weak, and you leave your starship (the network), vulnerable to all kinds of cosmic mischief. Hence, the shield’s parameters need to be a subject of ongoing governance, fine-tuned based on active threat assessments, user experience, and the network's current "battle conditions."

The shields also act as an absorber of excess energy production (inflation), so more power can be routed to the shields (up transaction and service costs) when more energy needs to be dissipated, as long as we're mindful of the side effects and balance the energy accordingly.

**Communication Nexus: Inter-chain Alliances and Strategic Partnerships**

Think of strategic partnerships as forming alliances with other civilizations or trading outposts. These alliances could offer critical supplies, advanced technologies, or military support. In our case, alliances with other blockchain platforms will provide new users, developers, and increased computational usage, while affording our partners advantages as well.

**Summary**

To sum it up, these changes should be made

1. Scale node rewards based on usage, with a minimum so that they at least break even.
2. Establish automated feedback mechanisms to make adjustments, and a team to assemble reports for the voters to base decisions on.
3. Increase transaction fees and service costs dynamically when inflation is too high, while being mindful of the consequences of doing so.
4. Improve documentation and make tutorials to help onboard new users and developers. Hold more frequent events like hackathons and boot camps.
5. Start reaching out to other blockchains and popular projects on those chains to increase demand.

[/quote]

We can’t just lock node rewards in a neuron. I agree we should do that, but we have to cap node rewards too. If not, excessive amounts of voting power is transferred to Node Providers and instead of having run away inflation result in the price dumping, we get run away inflation resulting in everyone who’s not a node provider being diluted.

And the minute we impose a cap on the amount of ICP node providers can receive, we have to impose some sort of system for tracking and repaying the missed value that node providers haven’t received as a result of the cap. 

I do agree, it’s time to reach a consensus and begin drafting a proposal. Dfinity has demonstrated no appetite for participating in this discussion. It’s time to act.

As I've been following this thread it don't think we've identified a working solution that will evolve to consensus, though correct me if I'm wrong @Accumulating.icp; and my deepest thanks for introducing this topic with due amount of research and sensitivity. 

The general sticking points for proposals so far is that messing with NP rewards is a bad idea, and no-one knows where money to make up the difference would come from. I'd like to introduce a more drastic, though simple solution that addresses the issue at a different 'root'.

By @Accumulating.icp estimates, inflationary sell pressure at current levels comes from:

**Monthly N.P Rewards | 583,577**
**Monthly N.P Rewards Sent to Exchanges | 275,287.49**
**Monthly Disbursed ICP | 1,091,778**

NNS neurons contributing 2-4X current NP rewards tells me it's closer to the 'root', and we know from @Kyle_Langham that neuron dispersion will continue at ~1M+ ICP/Month for about the next year, and then drastically decrease. My interpretation of this is that we just need to get 'over the hump' without having node rewards do irreversible damage to ICP's Total Supply.

Therefore my proposal is an NNS upgrade the locks dissolving neurons with a short dissolve delay while ICP is below a certain price (I'd recommend $5/ICP). Rewards continue normally, but dissolving neurons with <12month dissolution become locked until ICP rises above $5 again. I think maturity is insignificant enough to remain unchanged, but we can decide together if the community supports this idea.

It's not the team's place to initiate this, but I think there is finally legitimate precedent to stop the bleeding, and not for 'token price', but so I can build with the peace of knowing this network will exist in a year. It will most anger the people that it best serves, and it will take all the fuel out of the fire that ICP's alleged 'enemies' might be looking to use towards something more permanent at this very moment. 

Caveat: This is an absolutely horrible idea IF there's still a significant amount of liquid ICP held by $0.03 round seed investors or other VCs. My impression was that they pretty much all got out, but I don't know if this can be investigated/calculated.

gatsby_esp | 2023-09-14 13:48:57 UTC | #118

Again.. this is debt restructuring.
New nodes should be warned that under a certain threshold there is a cap on $icp received. Cause they are investors!!!
Think of AWS or other cloud provider.. their equipment is part of the equity!! Thus, node providers should share losses!! Any other solution takes us to zero.

Jesse | 2023-09-14 14:23:13 UTC | #120

The changes you mention here aren’t necessarily right or wrong. But we need to come up with changes that we can submit in a proposal and vote on in an effort to resolve the *specific* issue of run-away inflation as a result of Node Provider rewards *specifically*. The rest of the categories of focus that you mention will each require separate deliberation.


**Here is a summary of necessary changes that I’m proposing in an effort to resolve the very specific issue of run-away inflation as a result of node rewards payments during times in which the price of ICP is depressed:** 

1.) a fixed fiat value is assigned as the amount due to be paid to node providers (we can discuss what we think this value should be. If it is less than what is currently paid to node providers, so be it.). Node Provider rewards are dispersed in ICP.

2.)There is a cap placed on the amount of ICP that may be dispersed as payment to node providers. (We can discuss what number would be appropriate as a cap)

3.) Any value that hasn’t been dispersed to node providers is tracked as 0% interest debt owed to the node providers by the network. This debt is later serviced when the price of ICP has risen enough to permit the NNS to be able to service the debt while staying within the ICP cap that we decide on.

This solution was discounted as a mere “debt restructuring” and not a solution. I will now make my case as to why this is the better option amongst the other options proposed.

1.) It addresses the issue of run-away inflation as a result of Node Provider payment obligations. It does so by placing a cap on the maximum amount of ICP that is to be dispersed as payment to node providers.

2.) It addresses the issue of neuron stakers being diluted by rewards paid out to node providers. It does so, again, by placing a cap on the maximum amount of ICP that is to be dispersed as payment to node providers.


3.) It transfers a reasonable amount of risk from the NNS over to node providers. It does so by allowing the NNS to receive services from node providers, undisrupted, even when the value of ICP is too low to cover full costs to Node Providers while staying within the rewards cap. The NNS tracks the value owed to Node Providers as accounts payable. This is done at a 0% interest rate and with no hard deadline in which the NNS is obligated to repay node providers. Thus, affording the NNS time to allow the price of ICP to recover.

4.) It takes into account the fixed overhead overhead costs of node providers. It ensures that they are sufficiently compensated in a manner that preserves economic incentive for them to continue operations. 

5.) It forces node providers to become investors in the NNS. Not by locking up their rewards into a neuron, leaving them unable to pay their overhead costs in the short term. Instead it mandates that node providers invest in the form of providing a 0% interest line of credit to the NNS in times of economic strain. 

I’m open to other options. But if anyone does decide to propose another option, it should fulfill the following requirements:

1.) take into account the operation expenses of node providers in a way that doesn’t remove all economic incentive for Node Providers to contribute to the network. 

2.) eliminate the risk of run-away inflation as a result of node provider rewards dispersals.

3.) eliminate the risk of all other neuron stakers being diluted by rewards paid out to node providers. 


Before anyone comments (again) with “it doesn’t solve the root of the problem”, I want to reiterate that the *only* way to solve the root of the problem is to increase network activity and that is the job of the developers. What we need to achieve here is a system that allows developers to continue doing their work during periods of economic strain. The solution I’m proposing is meant to solve the issue of the ecosystem collapsing as a result of short term price depression. It is not intended to solve the overarching issue of insufficient network activity. Again the issue of network activity is to be resolved by developers in the ecosystem. Our one and only goal in this discussion needs to be to create a system that allows developers to keep developing during times of price depression, while preventing the NNS from collapsing.

Could you link to the product you're working on (if it's for this)? I'm having trouble threading together all your reply's. 

And just to clarify, my reasoning for not focusing specifically on the NPs is because their contribution is consequential to network stability/integrity, while angry neurons can't do anything detrimental. There's already caps on NPs, but the reason they might fail is a direct result of NNS dispersion (I think), which can be easily tapered. But I'm out of my depth when trying to understand the position of node providers and think your solution is the best in this thread IF we found the perfect parameters and implementation (which seems much harder). Would love those NPs to jump back in here.

[/quote]

I completely agree that their contribution is vital. A cap on node rewards is also necessary. There’s no silver bullet to this issue. There’s going to need to be some give and take from both parties involved (the parties being the NNS and the Node providers). I think the the solution I’m proposing does the best job at acknowledging the nuance here. 

Here’s a link to the post i made where i reference the product that I’m building to serve as a long term, sustainable solution to this issue: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/node-provider-inflation-spiral/22949/54?u=jesse

To summarize, I’ve built an app that doesn’t require coding experience in order to own, operate, update or transfer. The plan is to give every consumer within the ICP ecosystem their own app and by doing that, it increases network activity by leaps and bounds. This removes the bottleneck in network activity from being tied to the number of *devs* in the ecosystem, to being tied to the number of *users* in the ecosystem. 

To release this app will take me more time. I’m months away from an alpha launch and probably a year away from the product being refined enough to the point where it’s ready to be distributed en masse. 

There is reason to believe that network activity will increase enough to resolve this issue, but we need time to work.

I don't think the amount of conversation on this topic is excessive - it's a complex problem with a lot of noisy data. Moreover, getting a reasonable, well-thought-out proposal is going to take some time, and putting something forward that makes us feel good but takes us in the wrong direction, could be devastating.  One of the lessons that my business career drilled into me was to be really careful before messing around with incentives - you can really create a lot of ill will with stakeholders that is hard to recover from (years).

At this point, I am not sure we even understand what is driving ICP's recent price declines or that we understand who our investors are, and what causes them to buy, sell, or hold ICP relative to other assets. There are over 250 million tokens floating around unstaked and it looks like 5 to 10 million tokens trade on a typical day (200 million exchanges a month). Kyle seems to have the best data and at current levels, it is far from compelling in terms of explaining recent price behavior. Maybe but maybe not. (BTW USD have been inflating at 5 to 10). 

I think that we can agree that we do know certain things and that certain actions might be helpful: 
a.A The whole idea of staking is to give control of the network to those with a long-term interest and to reward that behavior. We have a strong preference for compounding rather than liquidation of rewards. Therefore a staking structure that incentivizes compounding vs. disbursing rewards would be better. Maybe full reward if you compound and half if you pull out rewards before maturity. 
b. We need to burn more. It seems that the transaction fees could be increased and made variable based on the size of the transaction. Not clear that this will change pricing behavior but seems like a limited downside.  Could be a baby step in the right direction. 
c  If ICP price drops too low, the model breaks down.  There is some price level/rate of inflation where it causes a spiral. One way to deal with this would be to cap the maximum inflation of the network (e.g., 12 percent/year. declining over time or $x share) with a waterfall of actions that would kick in that prevent inflation from going above that - it could be either be deferrals or a shadow tracker per DavidF where the reward is paid out when either price hits a certain threshold or at some point the reward is unlocked at a future date. 
d. Put a freeze on hardware/node providers for the time being. 

But we need to be very careful - if we just clamp down and start changing incentives, we may generate exactly the opposite behavior that we want.  For example, what if you change maturity and everyone hits the dissolve button? Or loses confidence in the network and stops investing and sells loose tokens? Or if you defer node rewards and then the node holders decide to dump 100 percent of their rewards and liquidate current holdings? Easy to get wrong.

The others points you mentioned are all valid. Each of them are intricate topics in and of themselves which will require extensive deliberation separately. The issue we currently need to zero in on is the one you've listed that I've quoted here. This is the most pressing issue at the moment as it is the one with the greatest likelihood of causing a network collapse under current conditions. 

I completely agree that incentives need to be thoroughly considered. This is why I'm opposed to the idea of forcing Node Providers to receive their payments as staked neurons. This could easily disincentivize node providers from contributing to the network as it would make covering operations in the short term prohibitively expensive for various node providers around the world. Node providers should maintain the autonomy to be able to assess and balance risks in a manner thats specific to their businesses' geographical and political conditions. Requiring node providers to accept their compensation as staked neurons would strip them of that autonomy.

  The proposition I made is done with two goals in mind:

1.) Decentralize risk. Currently, risk is centralized to the NNS. If the price of ICP drops below a certain threshold, the result is an inflationary collapse of the entire NNS. If this happens, everyone is screwed, all at once. By placing a cap on inflation generated for node reward dispersals while tracking the balance owed to node providers and later paying that balance down as the price of $ICP rises, node providers are allowed the autonomy that they need in order to balance their own respective balance sheets in accordance to their specific geographical and political environment. On the other hand, if we force node providers to receive their rewards as staked neurons, it raises the already high barrier to entry for new nodes wanting to contribute to the network; anyone wanting to be a node provider would have to have enough money to run an entire data center at a deficit for however long it takes for their first neuron to unlock. This is a *huge* barrier to entry to becoming a node provider and I'm firmly against imposing it. 

2.) Maintain sufficient incentives for node providers to continue to contribute to the network. I've considered the perspective of node providers and came to the conclusion that anyone whose willing to buy specific hardware to contribute to the network has at least some level of trust in the network. By implementing a system in which the node providers provide services to the network on credit during times of macroeconomic strain we *presume* that node providers trust the network enough to issue a 0% interest line a credit. This presumption is not all that farfetched and I assert that it is the least likely to negatively impact the incentivization of both current and future node providers. 

I do believe its important for us not to rush a solution, but it is equally important that we do not find ourselves in an "analysis paralysis" scenario at such a precarious time for the network. As you said, we don't understand who our investors are or what motivates them to divest. I'm of the position that our investors are dangerously close to divesting if this issue is not contained ASAP. We've already seen the price of $ICP decouple from similar networks like Filecoin. My guess is this is the result of some investors losing trust in the network deciding to divest as a result. An inflationary death spiral could happen at any moment and it could happen fast. If you have a better proposal, by all means do let us know, but if not, I think its important that we begin working out the details on the proposals that I've made.

-------------------------

smaug | 2023-09-14 17:44:13 UTC | #128

I am in the other camp. I’ve found that delays for excessive research and debate can stifle progress and sometimes ruin a project. Positive action is better than none, in my opinion. Since we can always update the incentives via proposal it’s better to get an improved set in place quickly and revise/update them as needed.

-------------------------

bigbro | 2023-09-14 17:46:31 UTC | #129

What is the analysis on 3.31M ICP unlocked each month from Seed/Strategic round? It gets locked or dumped? 

This unlock is only valid explanation to price dump. Not node rewards.

Why switch condition on node providers when you can switch condition on early investors?

Discussed option for "Any value that hasn’t been dispersed to **seed/private sale neurons monthly** is tracked as 0% interest debt owed to the **seed/private sale neurons monthly**  by the network. This debt is later serviced when the price of ICP has risen enough to permit the NNS to be able to service the debt while staying within the ICP cap that we decide on."?

Lot of people making forked threads of this. I think it's appropriate for you @Jesse and/or @Accumulating.icp to start fresh thread on parameters for NP reward parameters that we can follow.

I fully support this proposal idea, but do think it should be made also with respect to the NNS unlocks/rewards as a pure timetable issue. Your app for this is months away from completion, as would be any implementation of these revised node provider incentives. A change to neuron parameters, in my admittedly very limited understand of it, could be changed very quickly.

it's real simple the network just don't need 546 nodes as it has right now.  look at the cycle usage it's a pittance.  no real business would provision hundreds of servers when maybe 20 would do...

hell go crazy and have 50 or 100, but not 546. this is totally detached from the reality of network usage and scaling required presently, perhaps people thought IC would get crazy adoption but it didn't. so time to trim the fat.

we are just paying for electrons and silicon that's sitting their warming up some data centers, and these NPs have to dump into the market to pay for their servers to sit there waiting for customers who don't exist.

I think the sense of urgency in this forum thread escalated too quickly today.  While I agree it’s a good topic to discuss, we don’t need to try to turn it into a community driven proposal at this time.  Node provider rewards are issued monthly approx mid month.  This is a slower moving train that doesn’t need a hasty solution.  It needs more thorough analysis and consideration.  I recommend slowing down and giving more people more time to digest information and ideate.

Yep. I understand the fear but making hasty decisions and implementing half-baked ideas based on it is a recipe for disaster.

If they aren't part of the ideation and proposal process we're likely to go too far and turn them off for good.

Currently, I'm not in favor of blaming node providers as scapegoat for the inflationary problem by cutting their reward, or increasing the costs for developers. Why should we punish node providers when they are doing an excellent job of maintaining quality service? Increasing cycles cost also could lead to lower market attractiveness.

Do not blame production department as because ICP face market demand issue. The crosshair target should goes to the sales & marketing department.

While responsible Node Provider onboarding is essential, it should not compromise service quality. To achieve this, we can establish a metric to balance network demand and Node Provider onboarding. For instance, we can define a minimum ratio of cycles burnt to ICP reward per node provider. If the projected forecast doesn't support this ratio (too low demand), we should temporarily halt onboarding new Node Providers, and existing ones should postpone capacity increases.

Lets ignore neurons for a second.

Apps burn cycles, nodes process cycles, if what node providers are getting paid to process cycles, is higher than what Apps burn then we are operating at a loss.

This loss is manifested via inflation, additional tokens are created and sold on the market, they have to be sold to cover costs, if there are no nodes there is no network. If nobody buys the tokens the price comes down and the project dies. That's just market economics.

Anybody buying tokens is essentially betting that App burn cycles will go up. They are betting that eventually, more cycles are being burnt than what is being paid to the node providers. If/When this happens there will be a high demand for (ICP) from cycles and it will also become deflationary. The tokens you bought and held are now going up via deflation and there is a demand for these tokens through utility. The investors buying into the inflation will get that back through deflation and demand at a later date, they also get the bonus of a vote on how the network is ran.

There is no problem with this, as far as I can see.

The problem is this. We are operating at a loss and nodes are **still** being added to the network faster than they are required by Apps. Investors are accepting more and more nodes through proposals every time a proposal comes in, and essentially, for want of a better word, fucking themselves to the benefit of the node providers. See proposals 124507, 124499 and 124524 which are currently going to pass.

Investors needs to pause and reject these proposals. There needs to be a view we have (as decision makers) which shows us where we are capacity wise, we should only be adding nodes when they're needed, either geographically or by capacity, else we (investors) are the ones complaining about what we are causing.

Now let's discuss neurons, the interest they pay is bonkers! Certainly at this moment in time.They should be treated as dividends.

When we get to the point where more cycles are being burnt than what node providers are being paid, and we enter deflation, THEN we can create ICP to pay the investors (those voting through neurons). So if deflation was at 100M ICP a year, 80M ICP would be split between the voting neuron holders with a bigger percentage going to those with the longest delay.

The above example would mean ICP deflates 20M per year, when ICP is at X (lets say 300M ICP) then 100% of deflation gets created as ICP and split between voting neurons.

Maturity needs to stop being paid ASAP. I suggest any maturity that would have been paid goes into a weighted pot for future "dividends", so people who are invested now get more than someone who comes along once we are deflationary.

Let's ask this question then:

Why is DFINITY onboarding new node providers if their computation is not yet needed, and on top of that, we are facing an imminent death spiral event?

There are two answers to this in my mind, help me understand which one is the correct answer:

1. DFINITY is working against the best interests of the ICP network.
2. There is no inflation spiral in sight.

If there's more nuance to this, would appreciate any help understanding it.

-------------------------

bluesteel | 2023-09-15 12:52:13 UTC | #147

As far as I’m aware, we who vote on the proposals are onboarding them, not DFINITY. I mean, I can apply to spin up a few servers in a data centre now, if it passes the proposal I’m in, sure DFINITY get a vote and have a big say but that’s all.

-------------------------

BasedGiant | 2023-09-15 12:56:02 UTC | #148

I don't think anyone (or at least not a significant number of entities) votes manually on proposals that are not Governance, and as far as I am aware onboarding node providers fall into a different category.

Therefore they are onboarded by DFINITY.

We’re all human. People make mistakes. It’s a flawed logic to assume that they can do no wrong. 

The data shows we’re on the brink of an inflation spiral, with very little limiting where it actually stops: according to current parameters, we’ll settle at ~30% Inflation annually between Nodes & Neurons.

It’s very possible it was simply an oversight.

-------------------------

BasedGiant | 2023-09-15 13:02:26 UTC | #150

Humans can make mistakes indeed, 100% agreed on that.

What doesn't make sense in my mind is why isn't someone at DFINITY (especially someone from the higher ranks who should be completely aware of this) pulling the plug and preventing this inflation spiral if it's an impending one.

I'm not trying to be a contrarian here, but for me to see this as a threat, the answer to my question above needs to make sense.

9o0rl | 2023-09-15 13:19:06 UTC | #153

For the purposes of illustrating that deflation doesn't lead to increased price (at least short term). I would like to submit this eth 2.0 supply chart showing the eth supply post merge. Likewise, if ICP seeking to avoid an inflationary spiral brought on by NP provider rewards, through increase of price by becoming deflationary, that is not sufficient to result in price increase. The balance of buyers to sellers must also be adjusted so there are more buyers. 

That is to say, that as I described [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/node-provider-inflation-spiral/22949/91?u=9o0rl) Node Provider rewards should be aligned with appreciating ICP rather declining ICP. How can NP incentive structure be adjusted to coincide with an appreciating ICP price rather than a declining ICP price? Because currently, If i were a node provider, i would prefer for the ICP price to temporarily decline in value so I could receive more ICP, and then sell it for a profit when the price of ICP goes back up. Over time, NP would gain increasingly large control over the network. 

This is why so many node providers are seeking to be onboarded despite a declining ICP price. One option would be if the NNS allocated ICP and deposited an insurance fund which allocated a certain amount of ICP dedicated for NP compensation into a covered call option strategy, in the event of a ICP price decline, the covered call options returns would be used to pay for the node provider rewards **without having to sell or mint any new ICP** . On the other hand, if the price of ICP appreciated, and the covered call strategy was in the red, then new ICP could be minted to pay for NP rewards.

This is a great point.  I’m not sure anyone is really paying attention to these proposals and voting on them independently.  The proposal topic still falls under All Topics catch all, which means most of the NNS votes when Dfinity votes.  A problem we have is that there is no incentive for anyone to put in the extra work it takes to review and decide if a new node provider is really needed.  Sure we can say that we should all have a vested interest to prevent over inflation, but that just means most of us need to follow someone with suitable expertise.  Of course, Dfinity has this expertise, but if the community wants an alternative there is nobody who is incentivized to contribute to the IC in this way.

I don’t intend to imply that DFINITY has not discussed it internally (@bjoernek recent post certainly shows it has been contemplated within the Foundation), I was rather responding to @BasedGiant semi-rhetorical question implying that the situation is not deemed a threat unless DFINITY is raising the thought that an inflation spiral is imminent. However, I’d have to imagine leading into this conversation, the “Inflation Spiral” subject was not too hot of a topic within the foundation. 

Regarding the foundations reasoning to avoid public discussion amidst solutions being weighed against each other - I can completely understand. Typically when the Foundation gives its opinion it sways the sentiment of the ecosystem rather swiftly. 

Just wanted to add that I really appreciate how active & critical the Foundation has been in regards to this (& a few other topics) as of late. Changes like this do not go unnoticed🤝

Two small impacts that could assist in solving this issue without side effects based on a mundane comprehension of this evolving, complex system. 

1. Properly charge/burn for queries.
2. Pay node providers 1 month from their unique start date, as opposed to all at the same day to distribute liquidity. 

There is likely other factors that could be modified without consequence for marginal efficacy.

It’s true that contraction of supply does not simply increase price, and that expansion of the supply does not alone decrease price. As an obvious example, the federal reserve is presently extracting US Dollars from the global economy but there is still inflation in terms of USD.

But if the federal reserve were still expanding the supply of money we can be sure inflation would be higher. There is definitely a relation between change in supply and inflation.

Anyways just a thought. I appreciate this conversation taking place and that Dfinity is listening.

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-16 13:45:02 UTC | #164

If we are creating this inflation spiral by onboarding new NP for decentralization then it seems as we assign new nodes to subnets to increase decentralization in a subnet the nodes that are removed from a subnet that CANNOT be allocated to decentralize another subnet should get removed completely. This would help mitigate inflationary pressure from onboarding to decentralize.

-------------------------

smaug | 2023-09-16 16:38:27 UTC | #165

I don’t think 5% increase in supply is a death spiral

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-09-16 17:22:17 UTC | #166

As an early observer and participant, I've witnessed ICP's growth and its journey in fostering decentralization. Last year, there was a noticeable lack of NP, especially from non-Western regions. A true sense of decentralization seemed elusive, with the majority of NPs originating from the Western world, predominantly the USA. Dfinity's decision to offer rewards based on geographic location was a commendable one. This made many eastern parts of the world invest in ICP for nodes. The cost usually starts around 100,000 USD and above. Opex from the Eastern region for connectivity is significantly high and comes with long term contracts, thus NP's have who have already deployed and are deploying have signed up for long term contracts with connectivity partners. Thus my suggestion is to have a good strategies on a short term solution with a balanced solution. 

Suggestion #2
From the perspective of Node provider, the current hardware and data center requirements set by ICP are spot-on. They shouldn't be altered. Lowering the bar, say by allowing any standard computer to participate, risks compromising system uptime and reliability. This is a key reason why many decentralized computing platforms haven't sustained. ICP stands tall, but we must remember that it's in competition with industry giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft in the cloud sector. ICP's decision to anchor in Tier 3 data centers is a strategic masterstroke. Using non-enterprise hardware should be avoided to maintain the platform's integrity.

Suggestion #3
Drawing from my experience as a software service provider, I'd urge Dfinity to increase its marketing strategies. There's a ripe opportunity to reach out to SaaS companies(Software companies that build software for clients as a service), encouraging them to develop and deploy on ICP. While ICP offers brilliantly simple tools for deploying static sites, Vue, HTML, Angular, and more, there's still a considerable gap when we compare deployments on platforms like Firebase to ICP.

This is a good point that is important to remember.  Diversity of node providers helps advance decentralization and there was a big push to on board node providers from under represented areas of the world.

This is a common request by the community.  I think it's perfectly valid for the community to want DFINITY to increase marketing strategies.  I also wonder if DFINITY is constrained in ways that we don't often recognize as a community.  For example, DFINITY is a non-profit organization that stood up a crypto token that many people want to believe is a security or could be designated as a security.  If they apply significant resources for marketing and promotions, especially if it moves ICP price, then I wonder if it will have a negative impact on their non-profit status or government rulings on the security status.  It seems to me that we need other organizations to fulfill a role for marketing of ICP.  I'd like to see the community support multiple large and professional organizations that can fill this role.

DavidM | 2023-09-19 17:37:18 UTC | #168

This is a great thread and it has raised a huge number of interrelated issues. I've been thinking about this a ton over the past week and reading through all of the responses. I have also gone back to look at currency hyperinflation - what causes it and what happens.

My reaction after having thought about it is that there are a ton of things to solve but the issue that was raised was hyperinflation and the idea of an existential risk caused by a collapse in token price.  The answer to that problem is to cap the inflation rate/defer and break the dependence on price and the idea of a spiral.  We actually don't know what level causes a runaway problem but looking at other examples, something like 12% per annum and 1% per month as a guess for illustrative purposes might be reasonable. 

I haven't checked Tromix's numbers (on post number 5, something like a $1.25 per ICP) is where the problem occurs.  So at that point, monthly NP rewards would be capped/deferred. If ICP keeps dropping beyond that level, at some point maturity might take a portion of the impact. 

One element that has not been extensively discussed on the thread is the issue of trust and community confidence.  Dfinity/ICP has to be one of the most ethical and trustworthy networks out there and with the best tech/technical talent. Yet the network has been under siege from the beginning from others - it hurt the launch a lot (FTX, lawfare attacks, manipulators). I am not sure that a lot of the actions that have been discussed will actually reduce sell-side pressure and that to the contrary, they could dramatically accelerate it.  We keep ignoring the fact that there are something like 250 million unlocked tokens and if you diminish trust in the network and people wash their hands of ICP that will hurt the network more than the inflation issue we are discussing.  So things like just locking maturity, and canceling rewards need a lot more thought and really aren't part of the issue that this initial thread was launched to discuss.

I think most stakeholders and fans of the IC can get their head around trying to take the idea of an accelerating downward spiral off the table (who wants that other than people that hate the IC?). So, I would propose that we focus on an inflation cap.

I am in favor of a short-term cap to address an existential threat.  Discussion is good in forum, and perhaps is best served by keeping options simple and direct, it terms of problem/solution.

And while there is wisdom in allowing the ICP community to take the lead in proposals, even with multiple threads so as to keep each proposers options distinct, it may also be a good idea for Dfinity to soon draft their own series of options and present them.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-24 13:13:59 UTC | #172

But do we want to be near max storage capacity? I can see a possible downside to being at max storage utilization. Such as increased performance degradation. This could have been set low to provide longer life to the servers. At launch this could have been established so initial servers were able to meet demand of the network while waiting the months it takes to onboard new nodes. Thus ensuring network stability in the beginning phases through utilizing more reliable servers with less load. Not a node provider so if someone could confirm if I am on track here that would be great.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-09-24 13:51:51 UTC | #173

You are correct, it takes 5 - 6 months to onboard a Node Provider. Basically it takes ICP half a year to scale if needed. It can be a single server or it can be 10. Due to shortage, 2 months is required for vendors to build the custom spec server and deliver it. so @Yeenoghu you are correct, we should never be at a capacity.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-09-24 14:05:03 UTC | #174

@Accumulating.icp There is a lot of interesting conversation going on this thread. It is crucial to understand the NP onboarding process. Since early this year Dffinity planned to work on true decentralization and moved to the Eastern part of the world. With that new NPs were onboarded. It takes around 4 - 5 months for the process to complete. This means half that 4 to 5 months find and ordering vendors to build custom server hardware. This is if the chip shortage remains the same and doesn't get worse. This is said well in this comment
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/handling-of-node-provider-rewards/23065/33

So basically it takes half a year for Dffinity to scale if there is a surge of usage. But I totally agree we should not go beyond what we can chew or be at capacity

[/quote]

I don’t think it’s exactly optimal for us to be “near” maximum storage capacity although when you consider the multitude of inefficiencies, a compounding effect begins to occur. 

The issue starts with how nodes are optimized - they’re currently limited to 300GB of ~30TB, however since raising the topic, I’ve heard 700GB is in discussion, although I’m still exploring this further. This translates to 1/100th of what these nodes have the potential for, although I understand another small fraction of storage is utilized for programs to run the nodes , replication of chain state, etc.

This 100x inefficiency is then compounded by the fact that we’re only utilizing 32.8% (3.55 TiB of 10.8 TiB) of the self imposed limitation of network state, while continuously on-boarding new nodes. 

I recognize it takes time to get these nodes operational, but there are 660 Nodes waiting to be added to subnets at this second. That means we have a ~70% inefficiency while more Nodes are waiting to be added to subnets than the entire Network itself currently has.

These inefficiencies are then compounded into the burn rate to node provider reward ratio: we’re burning ~5,000 ICP a month via cycles, while we mint ~600,000 ICP a month to compensate node providers. Which translates to ~.8% burnt of what is compensated to Node Providers.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-24 15:20:04 UTC | #176

I agree that that at this point in time the inefficiency is there. Compounded by decentralization efforts. But looking into the future isn't this scalability without the need to onboard new providers once our goal of decentralizing NP's is met? Or even buffer for utilization surges to prevent increased degradation to the servers when nodes cant be onboarded fast enough?

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-24 17:32:05 UTC | #177

This might be off topic. Can we scale down? Scaling down is a big part of scalable.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-09-25 06:17:52 UTC | #178

Good point, first we need to understand a few terminologies "Cloud" and "Baremetal". ICP has been set up to use bare-metal. As you have seen google allows apps to scale up and down saving "cost" but is it really ? Cloud environments are very complex on many layers and for Dffinity to achieve that it would be a long term goal from what I know. Looking at Google's pricing structure if you configure similarly to Gen2 on the google cloud it takes 12,000USD plus a month to pay. This is almost 4x higher than the highest NP getting paid based on location(Not considering Opex). So autoscaling comes with cost which is high per CPU and RAM. If we are heading in that direction a big architectural change would require on software and hardware layer. It's up to Dffinity. Then again considering why using Baremetal direction pros. Cost saving, less management cost, and easier to debug issues. Cons very hard to scalable up or down

-------------------------

nmp | 2023-09-25 13:39:36 UTC | #179

Currently we are paying the node providers more for computation than is actually used.

Since node providers can not ramp up or down quickly, it appears this cost is mostly fixed in the medium term.

Instead we could consider lowering the cost of computation (cycles) dynamically until the computation budget is used up. This should attract developers since storage/computation would become dramatically cheaper than AWS and alternatives.

Tldr;

We are paying a fixed cost for node providers anyway. Why not use this to lower prices for developers instead of the profits going to data centers and hardware manufacturers without being used. Let the market decide.

ray | 2023-09-26 10:09:55 UTC | #180

When they designed the tokenomics they thought there would be users on this chain to burn ICP in contrast to the inflation. 2 years after launch its clear there are almost zero users on the chain to burn the inflationary supply. Therefore the tokenomics are wrong for this project and must be immediately changed.

Besides that you just provided a blueprint for a malicious actor to nuke this project intentionally. I hope that you are aware of that.

Hi Kyle, your work on ICP has been great so far! What do you think of the fact that Dfinity has around 60 million liquid tokens which could be sold at any time? Say for example the market cap returns to $10billion, this would equate to over $1billion of liquid tokens. Does the foundation really need this much money to run? Have they considered burns to increase trust and decentralisation?

Completely agreed.

We can't just say no to people who have invested and we can't blindly add nodes in the same locations over and over. Suggestion to encourage the ordering of hardware should be done after the 10th step.

https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding

"Node operator record".Which defines the number of nodes and datacenter. This can be something the community can control if there is a reason to add nodes or not.

I too understand your frustration, it would be wise to find a mutual ground on saving both NP and investors on ICP. There is no point in adding more nodes in the same country or location that has already nodes or upcoming nodes. There can be a waiting list for such a process. On the second note it would be unethical to reject NPs who have shipped hardware. So let's understand deeper on the NP onboarding process. If the community has given an allocation for nodes. This can be seen in step 10 of the following link

https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding#10._Create_a_node_operator_record

This step defines the location and number of nodes. If the proposal is accepted usually NP will order hardware which will be very costly. My suggestion is there is where the community can decide if such a number of nodes is needed in that location. Dffinity has clearly explained the process in milestones here too.
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Roadmap

So don't you think this is what we should do in the short term. We should be informed, smart and strategic.

If Dfinity sees a lot of votes to reject node hardware it’ll light a fire under their @ss. They’ll do something before a node is rejected. If they don’t, it’s kind of like going on strike. We all suffer but hopefully we can come to an agreement.

We are back at 3.15 so there is no death spiral.

oh ok so keep onboarding all these nodes no one is using let's see how that will work out

I created a discussion/proposal for how this could be solved, and would love your input int he discussion:

You can’t be talking about me. A respected member of this community? Since when? When I first came here I proposed (on nns) forcing seed investors to be locked for 8 years.

The problem is this. We are operating at a loss and nodes are **still** being added to the network faster than they are required by Apps. Investors are accepting more and more nodes through proposals every time a proposal comes in, and essentially, for want of a better word, fucking themselves to the benefit of the node providers. See proposals 124507, 124499 and 124524 which are currently going to pass.

Investors needs to pause and reject these proposals. There needs to be a view we have (as decision makers) which shows us where we are capacity wise, we should only be adding nodes when they’re needed, either geographically or by capacity, else we (investors) are the ones complaining about what we are causing.

I agree, we need to pause and actually increase the user base and activity to justify all this node adding. We don't have to operate at max capacity of the nodes and data centers but we certainly could stand to increase the demand for the Internet Computer overall. In another thread created by @erikblues on this topic he said this regarding rewards: 

"But there is nothing making sure that there is a balance between those two:

* if there is MORE demand from dapps, it starts burning ICP faster.
* however, and here’s the kicker: if there are too many nodes, they keep generating ICP tokens, but those tokens arent used by any apps because there is no demand for it.
* and there is nothing stopping more and more nodes from being added to the network. There is a vote to decide on new nodes, but once a node has been accepted, it receives 100% rewards even if the network goes through a bear market, and even if all dApps stopped running. Nodes just keep getting rewards regardless. This is, in my eyes, an oversight.

To solve that, ICP would need to have a system in place that works like a free market regulating itself:

* if there’s a shortage of bananas on the market, the price goes up.
* if there are too many bananas on the market, the price drops."

I believe this would keep things balanced as well as incentivize developers to create useful and compelling dApps and manage them because currently there is very little with this inflation as well situations going on with DAO treasuries as discussed in this thread: [!ONLY “1 ICP” IN ICX’S SNS ICP Treasury! What is the Warning!, the Reflection!, the ACTION! for us?!?!?!](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/only-1-icp-in-icxs-sns-icp-treasury-what-is-the-warning-the-reflection-the-action-for-us/23798)

[quote="bluesteel, post:145, topic:22949"]
Maturity needs to stop being paid ASAP. I suggest any maturity that would have been paid goes into a weighted pot for future “dividends”, so people who are invested now get more than someone who comes along once we are deflationary.

I'm not opposed to this but I could see this being potentially very upsetting to a lot of people who are not apart of these conversations and don't understand what's going on in the background.
