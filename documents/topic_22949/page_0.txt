**Node Provider Inflation Spiral**

Please note that aside from raw data, this article is purely speculative with the intention of provoking thought & conversation. This article covers hypothetical scenarios at predetermined price points extrapolating from current metrics to observe potential futures. This article is not financial advice, nor should the scenarios within be considered as fact.

This stems from a conversation with a fellow ecosystem member regarding how Node Providers are rewarded for their contribution to the network - being a pre-determined payment of $SDR in the form of $ICP. If you are unaware what $SDR is; it is a stable currency that consists of a basket of real-world currency’s - it has no association to cryptocurrency & acts as a real world “stablecoin”. While explaining the concept, I began to think deeper about the implications of this functionality;

This meant that each Node has a dollar value assigned to it, that must be paid out - and is automatically done so in the form of $ICP.

This thought immediately drew parallels to the TERRA LUNA scenario. This refers to when the UST stablecoin lost its 1:1 dollar peg, and token holders were forced to “burn” UST to “mint” 1$ worth of LUNA - regardless of the cost of UST or LUNA itself, per the protocols parameters.

This resulted in an inflationary spiral - UST was exchanged directly for LUNA, increasing the supply, which was then sold to exchanges due to market circumstances, decreasing the demand of the token while increasing selling pressure. Hundreds of millions of LUNA tokens were minted & consequently sold, causing a complete collapse in the token price - all due to an algorithm that demanded a predetermined fiat price in the form of cryptocurrency.

While the Internet Computers’ functionality in discussion (Node Provider Rewards) does not exactly align with the functionality that resulted in the collapse of UST & LUNA, - given Node Provider Rewards are distributed on a monthly basis & the IC can scale the amount of Nodes rather robustly (although if a “scale-down” scenario was forced, this would directly degrade subnets, network speeds, and the dApps hosted upon them) - parallels can certainly be drawn in the algorithmic fiat-cryptocurrency exchange functionality.

This of course piqued my interest; I was curious where exactly the breaking point was, - it needed to be calculated in order to prevent an irreversible catastrophic event for the network as a whole - which leads into the rest of the article. To reiterate, please note that this article purely speculative & extrapolative based upon information that is currently publicly available, and is only meant to reflect an extrapolative future assuming consistency in the current trajectory of the protocol.

To determine the stress the network would undergo, I first had to determine the amount of Node Provider Rewards distributed on a monthly basis.

To do so, I’ve gathered Node Provider Addresses from within the following proposals (indicating automated payouts for Node Providers listed), recorded most recent payouts, and utilized the figures to calculate a dollar value reward for each node provider.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/65056

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123596

However, this is not an extensive list, as the previous proposals include a total of 94 Addresses of Node Providers, while the Internet Computer Dashboard claims there is 96 Node Providers (at the time of writing).

This is most likely attributable to the “Participant Management” topic, in which Node Providers are seemingly added & removed from the network - however, this has no correlation to rewarded Node Providers, as this is handled solely through the “Node Provider Rewards” topic.

It should also be noted that Node Providers with a consecutive history of minting “0 ICP” rewards were removed from the information collected. These Node Providers are most likely inactive, or perform at degraded speeds - earning them rewards of “0 ICP” - as such, they are not relevant to the study, as it is based upon extrapolation of current data.

Aggregating the Node Provider information within the previous proposals produces the following results;

- The majority of Node Providers are pattern based. Those who sell rewards, do it consistently & regularly. The same can be said for those who keep rewards. This allows data to be extrapolated from past actions.  

- 94 Node Providers are enrolled in “Automatic Reward Minting”

- Of 94 Node Providers, 66 receive rewards on a regular basis. The remaining 28 consecutively mint “0 ICP” Rewards.

- Of 66 Node Providers receiving rewards, 20 Node Providers keep rewards, while the remaining 46 sell them to exchanges to maintain operation.

- In August 2023, the sum of Node Provider rewards was 583,577 ICP. Of which, 275,287.49037424 ICP (47.2%) was sold to exchanges by Node Providers, while 308,289.51 ICP (52.8%) was kept on-chain.

Node Provider Reward Data can be found within the spreadsheet below:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6ZOa7Nad9ZDcW02QHvpSvdjim1ePYAD2c8fy1z-8XY

From here, Exchange Data must be recorded & inspected in contrast to the “Node Provider Sell-Off”. The most relevant information to the study will be volume of exchanges, and the supply held within exchange wallets, as this determines liquidity available & required for healthy trading action. Please note that the following data does not include all exchanges, but rather the most prominent in terms of volume & liquidity. Additionally, this is only a collection of active wallets tied to exchanges - there is a possibility that exchanges have unidentified & uncategorized cold wallets that were not included.

Aggregating Exchange Information from CoinMarketCap & the Internet Computer Blockchain Explorer produces the following results;

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-JwqnhY2xtt_n9XP4IAMi1uAQ8Z0Id-w7VRAo2Bwd50

Utilizing the data provided, it can be observed that Monthly Node Provider Selloffs equate to about 31.5% of daily spot volume.

Alternatively, the quantity of $ICP sold to exchanges on a monthly basis represents about 17.5% of the liquidity held by exchange hot wallets.

This is useful to depict the impact of volume & liquidity, as a recurring pattern of decline in price can be identified coinciding with the monthly Node Provider Reward Schedule. 

![IMG_0139|690x239](upload://hTUArpV8ZsumTXevInEcqiT0kYF.jpeg)


With the core factors identified, we can begin to extrapolate this data to determine when Node Provider Rewards begin to exceed available exchange liquidity - the scenario most likely to result in a collapse in price.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UlrlT3O1PggzbTAq4K2dS2hiBZELq8e3W3OPQiqmxY/edit

With the extrapolative values laid out, it is clear that Node Provider Rewards are currently on the brink of unleashing unprecedented levels of inflation, given market trends continue. 

**This raises the question:**

Should the Node Provider Rewards Minting Algorithm undergo modification to prevent the impending inflation spiral?

The fact node providers are paid in an $SDR equivalent amount of ICP tokens is extremely alarming in my opinion and this is something very new in crypto, for example BTC and ETH follow a disbursement schedule that rewards a set a amount of tokens regardless of the dollar value at the time.

I think ICP is in fact, set up for an inflationary spiral in terms of node provider rewards, unless the value of ICP rises. There is also an issue that setting up a node is very gate kept at the moment so even if some of the community wanted to keep the network alive in the event of the price spiralling to zero, they pretty couldn't due to the hardware requirements and the steps involved.

Very well thought out post, I think maybe this is a design flaw on Dfinity's end and they aimed to solve it in the far future via the badland nodes etc, but in the short term it is worrying.

Hi @Accumulating.icp thanks for posting.  I've been interested in this topic for a LONG time (here's a blog I wrote back in May '22 prior to joining DFINITY: https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/death-by-node-rewards-part-2).  I love that we have a community that is engaged in these topics and is as passionate as I am to analyze tokenomics from a data perspective.

I'd love to work on improving your model as I think the approach to understanding NP rewards in the context of exchange liquidity is novel and provides another perspective on the topic.  Prior to that though, I want to express to everyone reading my perspective that ICP sent to exchanges from node providers is still small relative to the amount of ICP sent to exchanges from neurons dissolving or maturity.  For this reason, I still have no concerns over the sustainability of the current tokenomic approach.

Regarding the analysis in the OP, a few things pop out:

1. For those who don't know, you can track node provider rewards on this page: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation.  Last month there was ~580k ICP in node provider rewards.
2. The claim that 50.5% of NP rewards are sent to exchanges matches a recent calculation I performed that suggested 65% of NP rewards are sent to exchanges (differences are most likely due to chosen timeframes).  Many NP chose to receive their rewards in their Coinbase or Binance accounts, so it's hard to tell if they are selling the ICP or if they are using Coinbase or Binance as the custodian.
3. @Accumulating.icp - I'd be interested in knowing more about how you chose your date ranges for "Pre Distribution" and "Post distribution" calculations.  It seems random from what I can tell:
Feb [-14 days, +18 days]
Mar [-14 days, +74 days]
Apr [-0 days, +25 days]
May [-17 days, +9 days]
June [-5 days, +60 days]
July [-2 days, +5 days]
Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the analysis?
4. The list of hot wallets for exchanges is missing a few.  I've identified a total of 14 highly-likely hot wallets for exchanges.  In addition there are ~20 cold storage wallets I've identified as likely owned by exchanges.  I'm happy to share those addresses if desired.  Nathan Scotland has done great work in this area as well.  Net result is I believe there is 66M ICP in wallets controlled by exchanges.

I'd love to keep this conversation going to flesh this analysis out more.  Let me know how I can best help.

Thanks for taking the time to respond @Kyle_Langham ! I’d love to continue this conversation with you, but first I’m going to address your pre-existing points/concerns.

This is shortsighted on my part - this definitely would have been easier than manually adding the figures (which is most likely what resulted in my inaccuracy). Thank you for providing the correct metric, and the source to easily find this information!

Thanks for this clarification - so I assume this implies that people have chosen to mint directly to their Coinbase / Binance wallet, to which the corresponding exchange immediately “drains” the account to the primary hot wallet. 

This would explain why on the block explorer it appears as though the Node Providers have chosen to send rewards to an exchange upon receiving them.

You scared me with that statement 😳 I think this is a misunderstanding - to find these values I utilized the 1st & 14th of each month, aligning with the price points referenced. 

When looking back, I also noticed these had slight inaccuracies (in the cents), so I’ve also updated this information alongside total Node Rewards for the month.

I also utilized the B221 app to verify exchange information after sourcing them from the block explorer & could not find reference to alternative wallets to what had been provided. 

As such, I’d greatly appreciate the additional wallet addresses so I can add them to this article!

66M vs 2M ICP is certainly quite a difference in liquidity!

With those points aside, I’m curious about your stance on the Inflationary Spiral in correlation to algorithmic minting of $ICP for node providers.

-------------------------

Tromix | 2023-09-11 16:58:28 UTC | #5

What price point initiates a death spiral? 
Because ICP will likely see $2.00 and lower.
Bitcoin will dump below 20k, and this will bring icp to its knees.

So we need to have a clear cut answer from dfinity what their plan is.

[/quote]

At 2$, we’re facing 2.4% annual inflation from Node Providers.

At 1.5$, we’re facing 3.2% annual inflation from Node Providers.

At 1$, we’re facing 4.9% annual inflation from Node Providers.

At 0.25$, we’re facing 19.6% annual inflation from Node Providers.

I think the “magic number” queuing an inflation spiral is going to be somewhere around 1$.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-09-11 17:20:26 UTC | #7

Interesting Math! 

Might have missed this part but are we calculating under the assumption of static volume? 

A sudden shift in volume positive or negative (negative is my current bias) could very much change the landscape rapidly 

What I'm personally interested in is the timeline 

Trying to do this for fun ATM, but I'd like to see the gradient of the chart and the rate of change of the gradient to see where at current rate, the price would go and the timeline for it 

^above would probably be grossly inaccurate due to the fast paced and changing environment but assuming some static variable would allow a picture of the worst case atleast 


Incase anyone has the question "who cares about price?" The concern is more about ICP sustainability than "investments" 

If we're able to sustain ICP for multiple years regardless of price action, that would give builders some reassurance

> With those points aside, I’m curious about your stance on the Inflationary Spiral in correlation to algorithmic minting of $ICP for node providers.

I'll start with this question first, since it's most likely top of everyone's mind.  I calculate that node providers provided 377k of the ICP that went to exchanges in August (580k ICP x 65%).  That's a little more than 10% of the 3.752M ICP that I think went to exchanges in August (calculated by examining hot wallet account behavior).  The vast majority (~70%) of that 3.752M was ICP that had previously dissolved off the NNS.  From that perspective, I'm not so concerned over node provider rewards at this time, however I agree it's worth keeping an eye on and we should be willing to act fast should the data tell us to.  Just my two cents.

> this definitely would have been easier than manually adding the figures (which is most likely what resulted in my inaccuracy)

The dashboard page is good for high level, but you would have had to look at each NP wallet to get to a % sent to exchanges (as you did).  As someone who has done the same analysis, I feel your pain :)  It's brute work tracing ICP movements.  Kudos for doing it!

> This would explain why on the block explorer it appears as though the Node Providers have chosen to send rewards to an exchange upon receiving them.

When ICP is sent to an exchange it (almost) always goes to an "client exchange wallet" which tells the exchange which of their clients sent them the ICP.  They then (again, almost) always sweep that ICP up to their hot wallet.  This behavior helps in analysis because it's easy to spot when ICP is sent to exchanges.

> As such, I’d greatly appreciate the additional wallet addresses so I can add them to this article!

I completely agree that in the immediate short term future, this is a non issue. 

The primary concern is if we continue upon our current trajectory, without a failsafe in place - amidst an ever-volatile market. 

While it’s true this only occurs on a monthly basis - it only takes one month of bad timing to start a landslide that will be very hard to clean up. 

I’ve been considering a few ways to “solve” this, and while I don’t think any are going to completely solve the problem, I think it’d be good to start the conversation:

1. Pay Node Providers in a defined amount of $ICP, over compensate in the short term, introduce halvenings to prevent over compensation longterm.

2. Pay Node Providers with Cycles burnt on their subnet.

3. Define a reward pool for Node Providers, similar to staking rewards, in which Node Providers equally split depending on contribution.

I have also a strong feeling that via a proposal the number of ICP that can be minted as Node Provider Rewards was limited (to prevent inflation spiral) but didn't find it so far (I think @diegop was involved..?).

Thank you for providing this! If fine tuned, this would definitely be the type of “fail safe” that would prevent a “TERRA/LUNA event”.

With that being said, I’m curious for further clarification upon this proposal:

While I recognize it says each **Node Provider** is capped at 100k ICP monthly, I’m curious if this applies to Nodes or the Node Providers themselves. Some Node Providers host dozens of nodes, and are already running extremely close to this 100k hard cap.

However, based off my math, with this hard cap in place, the maximum monthly inflation should be ~9.6M ICP (assuming the proposal is correct in categorizing Node Providers).

Ironically, this hard cap actually results in more extreme inflation than where we stopped (0.25$) within the inflation extrapolation model.

> I’ve been considering a few ways to “solve” this, and while I don’t think any are going to completely solve the problem, I think it’d be good to start the conversation:

There's a lot of wisdom in this statement.  I agree that it is prudent to discuss this potential problem and identify potential solutions should we (the NNS) begin to worry about the potential for a landslide.

I haven't invested much thought or research into how to solve this potential issue (only how to identify if it is an issue) so I don't have much to say in regards to suggested resolutions should NP rewards get out of hand.  However, I'll say it's certainly worth evaluating options and getting consensus around one or two so that the NNS could act fast should the need arise.

I'll flag this thread with the teams that handle NP rewards within DFINITY so they can add their thoughts.  In addition, I hope the community will follow in @Accumulating.icp's lead and also brainstorm and discuss ideas.

Cryptobaasnl | 2023-09-11 18:44:09 UTC | #13

Hello #ICPeople 

it’s CryptøBased from twitter @FullyOnChain

Could each node should spin up it's own 8year neuron automaticly and a percentage off the monthly rewards should be added to it every pay out so it could become more self sustainable and maybe even more profitable over the long term when price off icp grows also imo it would fair if all contributors off the inflation would give in a bit just my thoughts what do you guys think about it

[/quote]

I think this is a creative idea that would foster a stronger relationship & dependence between Node Providers & the blockchain as a whole. It would definitely amplify the “skin in the game” aspect of it, ensuring a portion of rewards are staked to accrue further interest. 

With that being said, I believe there’d be a couple issues implementing this:

Primarily, DFINITY is vocally opposed to Canister Controlled Neurons - actively stating they will do what is in their power to circumvent the function as they don’t believe it should exist. This has been showcased numerous times, most notably within the is_self_authenticating function. 

Secondarily, I think this has the potential to offer a double edged blade. If it is an indefinitely non-dissolving neuron, I could see the benefit in reduction of shortterm inflation in exchange for minimal long term inflation. Alternatively, if it has the potential to be unlocked, or even sold, via ID Geek, this drastically reduces the effectiveness. Unfortunately, we currently do not have this functionality (indefinitely locked neurons) available to us - so this is something that would require further development. 

With that being said, I’d agree that neuron’s are a unique solution to inflation to be explored - doubling as an income source over the long term, as DFINITY has shown.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-12 00:27:38 UTC | #15

There’s only two feasible solutions that I can think of:

1.) Some of the node providers pause operations, thereby lowering the amount of $ICP needed to pay node providers.

2.) Someone, (either the community, DFINITY, or a combination of the two) come up with the funds to pay the node providers. And their payments would need to be dispersed in a currency other than $ICP so that node providers don’t just add to the sell pressure when they sell the currency to cover costs. ckBTC would be the best candidate in this case. It’s built on the IC and would be easy to make a protocol that collects the funds from the IC community in a way that’s transparent and auditable. 

If the inflation rate gets to a point where it’s out of hand, we’ll probably have to implement some combination of the two solutions i just listed. Unless someone has a better solution.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-12 00:39:12 UTC | #16

To reduce inflation reward distribution could be reduced by estimated monthly neuron interest until the reward was completely sustained by the neuron. So the only full reward payment would be the node providers first payment. Afterwards rewards would scale down based on interest accrued monthly. Reward payments would cease completely when the neuron reaches the ability to produce the max hard cap reward regardless of new nodes added etc.

That said node providers will always need x ICP to operate sustainably. So the percentage allotment to neuron should not reduce liquid reward below x. This will be of more importance for the first payment in a schedule like this as once interest begins generating x can come from both rewards and neuron.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-12 01:31:09 UTC | #17

How do you guys come up with these complicated solutions.

we could just pay them a fixed rate of icp like every single other blockchain.

We don’t need to reinvent the wheel.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-12 01:34:12 UTC | #18

### Multicurrency Reward Pool

In line with your second proposition, why not establish a multicurrency reward pool where contributions could come from ICP holders and possibly even external financial systems interested in sustaining the ICP ecosystem? This pool could be auditable and transparently managed by smart contracts. ckBTC, as you mentioned, could serve as an apt candidate for disbursement.

### Staggered Sell-off Lock

Instead of doling out ICP rewards that can be instantaneously liquidated, enforce a time-based lock on the ability to sell off the rewarded tokens. The duration of this lock could be inversely proportional to the stability of the ICP value. In times of high volatility, the lock extends, thus discouraging sell-offs and reducing market pressure. This idea could be further nuanced by applying a decay function to the lock period, thereby allowing gradual releases that don't shock the market.

I completely agree with @Accumulating.icp 

We should come up with a solution as soon as we can instead of waiting for the situation to get more concerning . Market forces more often than not are smarter than we think. If icp price gets to a point where we start to be concerned about this issue, that’s prolly already too late . Price goes to 0 and it’s all over . 

I really hope the team can brainstorm different ways e.g. set strict limits on node rewards , or pay them in a currency other than fiat , etc. to get this resolved in the short term . Only in that way can we remove all the concerns we have and market forces don’t have a chance either .

What happened to proof of useful work that we where brandishing?

@alejandrade , The problem with paying a fixed price in $ICP is that node providers for the IC are data centers with overhead costs that must be covered in order for them to Provide reliable compute power. Other blockchains can pay a fixed price to node providers as rewards because they have node hardware that someone can set up in their basements if necessary. The cost of operation for a data center vs that of a basement node are vastly different. Paying a data center a fixed amount of ICP would result in all of the node providers having to cease operations all at once when the price of ICP drops below a certain threshold. 

I’ll give an example of what i mean:
Let’s say 1 $ICP = $10 USD and it costs $10,000 per month to operate a data center. We agree to pay the node providers a fixed rate of 1500 $ICP per month. The first month, the node providers would make enough to cover their overhead costs and take profits. 

The next month, the price of $ICP drops to $3 USD. We pay the node providers the agreed upon price of 1500 $ICP. This month, they’d only earn $4500 USD. This would mean they’re $5,500 short of what they need to run operations- forcing them to shut down operations.

Now imagine all of the IC’s data centers having this issue at the same time. ICP would literally be inoperable over night. 

Paying Node providers a fixed amount of ICP every month is not a solution. In fact, it’d be catastrophic.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-12 02:29:25 UTC | #22

The problem is that they are getting paid in cash value no matter if they are working or not. This is another problem caused by trying to reinvent the wheel.

This problem has been solved, proof of stake exists. 

It should be a minimum amount of ICP staked to be able to host a node and payment should be either fixed return like POS or proof of useful work.


And some node providers will not be profitable while others will be. Some will make more money then others all this is ok.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-12 02:33:14 UTC | #23

Another alternative could be something similar to the neurons fund. All neurons pay maturity to a fund that distributes to providers accordingly. The current node provider rewards could be sent to governance so the current interest would be the same. To reduce inflation the NP reward aspect to governance would need to diminish over time. There would also be a need to increase the NP reward aspect each time a node provider would have normally had an increase in rewards up to the max allocation per NP. Failure to do so would lower % yield each time an NP was onboarded or added new nodes. Which may in turn promote governors to turn down new NP requests. Modulation could be applied here in such a way that during times when the network needs expansion and more nodes the reward incentive to the governance pool is higher(resulting in neurons gaining % yield) than at times when there is less of a need and thus less of a reward(which results in neurons paying to add new nodes).

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-09-12 02:58:22 UTC | #24

Hey @Kyle_Langham (or anyone else) are there any contractual agreements with node providers that would limit making changes to their payouts?

Also, developer grants are paid in fiat equivalents as well.  Hence, that funding is paid with higher amounts of ICP as ICP price goes down just like node providers.  Even if we are not minting new tokens for developer grants, it seems likely that most of those payouts are adding to sell pressure.  What is the scale of developer grants relative to node providers?  Should it be of similar concern?  I suspect most people would not advocate for reducing payouts for developer grants.  Hence, it seems fair to bring it up in the context of discussions for reducing rewards to node providers.  Do we have the stomach to reduce both or is there good justification for only considering changes to one?

Of all the ideas I’ve heard so far, I like the one introduced by @Cryptobaasnl the most.  Specifically this part…


[quote="Cryptobaasnl, post:13, topic:22949"]
Could each node should spin up it’s own 8year neuron automaticly and a percentage off the monthly rewards should be added to it every pay out
[/quote]

Using this approach, the total node provider rewards wouldn’t have to be reduced.  Instead, a percentage would be “topped up” into their own 8YG neuron.  This seems easy to implement into the NNS since all it requires is knowing the account ID and neuron ID.  Anybody can top up any neuron with this information and it seems plausible to enable node providers to provide this information for use by the NNS.  This approach would ensure there is very little sell pressure from the fraction of the rewards that get topped up into a node providers neuron.  This seems like a preferable alternative to a forced reduction in the total payments that they are expecting.

I personally would like to hear from node providers on this topic.  Of course nobody wins if price goes down below a certain point, so it seems reasonable to consider backup plans.

Hey @Accumulating.icp, I also want to say that you have done a fantastic job presenting this topic and leading the deliberation.  Keep up the good work.

Archetypal | 2023-09-12 03:03:56 UTC | #25

Yes! A combination of neuron rewards, a reward pool funded by donations from the those who have a vested interest in the network, multicurrency rewards (perhaps only ICP, ckBTC, and later ckETH), and direct ICP minting to fill in the gaps could provide the sustainability needed to prevent an inflationary death spiral no matter how low the price sinks.

This design would essentially operate as a cascading waterfall, each layer designed to function as a financial bulwark for the layer beneath it. Let's delve into its architecture.

### Tier 1: Donation Pools

The first echelon for rewards would consist of donation pools, aggregated from benevolent contributions in the form of ICP, ckBTC, and ckETH. This serves as the primary reservoir for node provider rewards. Its compositional diversity offers a modicum of hedging against market volatility, insulating the pool to some degree from cataclysmic fluctuations in any one asset. Payouts would start here, satisfying as many node provider obligations as possible.

### Tier 2: Neuron Maturity

Should the donation pools run dry or be insufficient, we move to the next tier: neuron maturity. In this scenario, matured rewards that are accrued by neuron holders are divvied up and allocated to the reward pool. This element introduces a sort of circular financial ecology, where node providers are indirectly compensated by the very network participants who benefit from a stable and efficient network.

### Rate Reset Mechanism

At the beginning of each node provider payment cycle, the rate at which rewards are doled out is reset. This dynamic recalibration ensures that the system remains nimble, capable of adapting to the vicissitudes of market conditions.

### Tier 3: ICP Minting & Excess Allocation

If the first two tiers fail to meet the node provider reward threshold—perhaps due to a depreciation in the price of ICP—then the system resorts to the controversial but necessary action of minting additional ICP tokens to meet the shortfall. Conversely, if there's an uptick in the price of ICP that results in excess ICP from neuron maturity, these surplus tokens flow back into the donation pool, replenishing it for the next payment cycle.

### Reflexivity and Balancing Act

The system's beauty lies in its inherent reflexivity; it feeds upon itself to establish equilibrium. During bullish periods, it's self-replenishing, and during bearish periods, it's self-sustaining, albeit at the cost of a slight inflationary bump.

However, this architecture is not without its challenges. Mechanisms must be put in place to ensure equitable allocation and to prevent any form of collusion or sybil attacks. Additionally, a constant audit of smart contracts governing this system would be imperative, ensuring both transparency and immutability.

In sum, the tiered system presents a sophisticated, self-balancing economic model that aims to reconcile the often divergent goals of incentivization and financial prudence. It's a system replete with checks and balances, each tier functioning as both a safety net and a financial springboard for the one that follows.

edit: there are concerns that this design minimizes risk too much, so node providers have no incentive to stick with the IC network. I did like the idea of a portion of the rewards being locked in 8yr neurons, since that would provide an incentive to commit to the network long-term.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-12 05:24:58 UTC | #28

It’s fun to fantasize I doubt anything will be done and we have no power. 😂.


If we want to fix emission we need to lower staking rewards. And if we want to lower staking rewards we should cut down everyone’s 8 year neuron to a max of 4

-------------------------

jonit | 2023-09-12 07:02:49 UTC | #29

But teams take on this risk and have overhead costs as well, are node providers more important than apps and projects? What are the overhead costs of running an App? 
Well you cant have ICP without nodes and you don't need nodes without apps and projects. In truth this is a feedback loop, and there needs to be a balance. The less inflation caused by nodes the more profit for apps. The more profit for apps the more users and more ICP is burned. 
There is a reason that central banks tweak interest rates, its because economics change on a regular basis due to many external factors.
Fixed rates of interest ( rewards ) don't make sense and lead to spirals of inflation or deflation

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-12 07:04:58 UTC | #30

I support this is a plan of action. 

@Jan , @domwoe, @diegop, it would be nice if we could get more people from the DFINITY foundation to engage with the community on this topic. Macroeconomic conditions are likely to continue to place sustained downward pressure on the crypto market for at least another 2 years or so. The topic of the very real possibility of run-away inflation caused by node provider rewards needs to be planned for.

-------------------------

hope888 | 2023-09-12 07:50:32 UTC | #31

The lower price, the more get. If it is me, I will definitely find a way to reduce the price of ICP. This is the sword of Damocles for every ICP investor.

[/quote]

Thanks for providing such an in-depth overview of the concept!
 
I think this is an interesting idea, although I believe it’d come with a range of pro’s & con’s that I’d love to walk through;

**Donation Pools**

Donation Pools would definitely contribute to providing a diverse source & form of funds, potentially offering insulation from market volatility. With that being said, this function is heavily reliant on human psychology & behavior - during a time in which people are going to be most inclined to abandon the network. Additionally, Donations can not be viewed as a long term form of funding, as they are typically infrequent, making it challenging to fulfill Node Provider obligations consistently (~2M$ USD Monthly). 

**Neuron Maturity**

While I see the logic in rewarding Node Providers Neurons from the Neuron Reward Pool, I believe directly front running the Neuron Reward Pool to payout Node Providers beforehand will have the unintended consequence of disincentivizing staking, potentially when it’s needed most.

For example, in the last month, if you observe disbursed & un-disbursed maturity, you’ll find that there was 2,680,437 ICP minted for Neuron Rewards. Alternatively, at present prices, ~580K ICP is minted monthly for Node Rewards. If this system were set in place today, this would reduce the current APY of Neurons by 21.6%. 

As the price descends, the scenario becomes more extreme, until an overlap occurs around 1$ - at which Neurons are no longer rewarded for providing security to the network through staking & voting.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2023-09-12 13:52:10 UTC | #35

The tokenomics should align with responsible accounting and cashflow principles of basic corporate finance. Currently, the tokenomics comprises two token printing streams: Node provider rewards and government voting rewards. 

It is advisable to start with only one token printing stream. Node provider rewards should be treated as a part of the cost of goods sold (COGS) and operational expenses, and therefore, onboarding new node providers will face constraints and limitations based on the network capacity & demand requirements. These expenses should be deducted from the voting rewards first, and any excess token inflation then will be distributed among the voters. 

For example, if the current voting reward is 3 million ICP per month and Node provider rewards amount to approximately 500,000 ICP per month, it implies that the ICP voting rewards to be distributed among the governance voters will be only 2.5 million ICP.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-12 14:02:34 UTC | #36

The issue is that it doesn’t solve anything, it just shifts the burden of responsibility.

It went from a burden of the network to a burden of the staker. 

You can’t just expect people to govern the network because they like it - there has to be some form of incentivization, being the staking reward itself. 

When you remove the staking reward, you remove the incentivization to stake, and everyone who has already staked, gets, for lack of better words, fucked.

This doesn’t prevent a hyper inflation scenario from occurring - it just forces neurons to bear the responsibility of it until the breaking point is reached, at which point they’re indefinitely trapped.

-------------------------

libin_421 | 2023-09-12 14:13:00 UTC | #37

It is recommended to set up a mechanism. When the currency price drops to a certain price, part of the node's fee will be put into neuron pledge.  Avoid the death spiral of falling more and more inflation, and more inflation and more fall.  While avoiding large-scale inflation, it also protects the interests of nodes.  Nodes are an important part of ICP's ecology, and nodes are also responsible for maintaining a healthy currency price.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2023-09-12 14:35:35 UTC | #38

The stakers are the ones who bear the responsibility for hyperinflation because they are the owners of the protocol. The stakers are also the ones in charge of governance, including being responsible for deciding how many NP they want to onboard and the rewards they need to set for the NPs. So, if we want to avoid hyperinflation, we cannot make everybody happy. We should find compromises.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-12 16:36:33 UTC | #39

I agree we need to find compromise. However, this is not a compromise that resolves the problem. 

It is one that temporarily delays it, until Neurons can no longer bear the burden - at which point we’re back where we started, yet stakers lost a few months of rewards along the way. 

We need a solution that makes this a non-issue in its entirety.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-09-12 16:37:03 UTC | #40

Just to confirm from my side as well: I am actively following the various discussions and ideas that are being presented in this thread. As @Kyle_Langham also pointed out, node provider rewards are currently not a significant factor in the overall inflation of ICP or in the amount of ICP moving to exchanges. However, I believe it is prudent to gather ideas and formulate a plan for various exchange rate scenarios.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-12 23:19:22 UTC | #41

I kept seeing you & @Kyle_Langham reference this as a non-issue in comparison to other forms of inflation, so I decided to aggregate current data to depict the reality of ICP inflation & an extrapolated future. 

**Monthly N.P Rewards | 583,577**

**Monthly N.P Rewards Sent to Exchanges | 275,287.49**

**Monthly Un-Disbursed Maturity | 1,582,659**

**Monthly Disbursed ICP | 1,091,778**

**Monthly Staked ICP | -1,644,659**

From here, the total potential inflationary sell pressure on a monthly basis can be determined by adding the monthly disbursed ICP, Monthly staked ICP, and monthly rewards sent to exchanges - equating to a total of 3,011,724.49 ICP. It should be noted that this equation does not include Un-Disbursed Maturity, however this could also add to inflationary selling pressure.

This shows that as of present, Node Provider Reward sell-off equates to ~9.1% of the monthly inflationary sell pressure at current prices. 

However, given Node Provider Rewards are paid in a static fiat amount, yet a variable ICP quantity, this data can be extrapolated to determine the contribution to inflationary sell pressure at the pre-determined points referenced within this article:

**Price - ICP to Exchanges - % of Inflation Sold**

**2.5$ - 385,627.6816 ICP - 12.3%**

**2$ - 482,034.602 ICP - 14.9%**

**1.5$ - 642,712.8026666668 ICP - 19%**

**1$ - 964,069.204 ICP - 26%**

**0.5$ - 1,928,138.408 ICP - 41.3%**

**0.25$ - 3,856,276.816 ICP - 58.4%**

In conclusion, I’d agree it’s a non-issue in comparison to other inflation rates within the immediate future.. Until it isn’t…

-------------------------

peterliumo1990 | 2023-09-12 20:29:49 UTC | #42

@bjoernek 

This sentence you wrote “ As @Kyle_Langham also pointed out, node provider rewards are currently not a significant factor in the overall inflation of ICP or in the amount of ICP moving to exchanges. ” is absolutely wrong . 

A year ago, it was less than 100k node rewards per month. Now it’s 600k node rewards per month. A simple back of the envelope calculation — if icp goes to $1, it’ll be close to 2 million rewards per month. When that happens, I guarantee you icp price goes straight to 0 within 1 day, just like what happened to other tokens that had supply-demand design fault. When that happens, the whole icp project becomes worthless.

tiago89 | 2023-09-12 23:54:39 UTC | #43

Very good topic indeed.

So far, I haven't read anything about cycles burn (and ICP burned to mint those cycles).

My impression was that we were "safe" in the NP rewards, because it would always be a % of the usage (adjusted in the medium term).

Its important to remember that Cycles are also priced at SDR, currently 1 ICP = 2.2 T Cycles, and I have the impression that a year ago it was about 1 ICP = 4 T Cycles, so the cheaper the ICP, the more burn will exist as well.

So I would only be worried about NP rewards if there isn't a match on the amount of burning.

Have checked the Dashboard and am struggling in comparing the burning with the rewards. Someone would even get scared by these differences:
![Screenshot_20230913_005337_Chrome|230x500](upload://pAuY8t3mDTW7dMBGLfX4ui1Z0x5.jpeg)

In the information it mentions Cycles burn, but on the graph it only shows the transactions + fees. Hopefully someone can ping a Dashboard dev team member and hopefully clarify if it's included or not that information. 

I tried to make the math from the average of cycles burned per second (which is 5.3 B (not T)). And at a conversion rate of 2.2T per icp, this would give a burn rate of only 6.3k ICP (when we are rewarding +500k ICP of NP rewards). 🤔

Please, someone confirm my math, but are we having a slippage of 98%? I can understand some subsidizing to attract more developers, but only charging 2% of the real cost, seems worrisome. 

If I am correct, then the problem needs to be more fixed on charging higher cycles cost in canisters (at double or triple order of magnitude). Also it needs to be deeper researched, how can costs be much higher than usage? Does it confirm that we are approving more node providers than we should?

Hopefully someone can confirm / answer some of these claims. I hope I'm mistaken 😅

Do something,please! ICP is running to zero!

-------------------------

hope888 | 2023-09-13 00:37:35 UTC | #45

we can learn from the Federal Reserve System, if inflation exceeds the limited value, NNS starts the nhibition plan，such as taxation of all links that generate ICP,the higher the inflation, the higher the taxation,until the inflation fell below the limited value.Reducing rewards is certainly annoying，but inflation will destroy everything。I would rather reward less, and I didn't want to run to zero.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2023-09-13 01:02:30 UTC | #46

Addressing hyperinflation from the supply side, such as by adjusting expenses or minting rewards for NP and Voter rewards, is crucial, however, it has limitations as these changes may impact the quality performance of the infrastructure.

In my view, the primary challenge that IC faces is low demand and usage, which is evident from the cycles being burned. I believe that by addressing this issue, along with implementing more responsible tokenomic, we can swiftly resolve the hyperinflation problem.

During the prolonged crypto and blockchain market downturn, while other projects may be in a more dire situation due to their specific focus on crypto and blockchain, IC has a distinct advantage due to its diverse range of use cases, especially in cloud services. To overcome current challenges, IC should prioritize expanding its marketing efforts beyond the crypto and blockchain industry to increase its network usage demand

This seems like a reasonable idea to consider.  It would also give NNS participants more skin in the game to study the need for new node providers and contribute more actively in the decision making process for their approval.  More node providers implies more decentralization, which resonates with most people in the ICP ecosystem.  However, subtracting their rewards from overall governance reward allocations would provide a stronger incentive to critically evaluate the need for more node providers.  It seems like an idea worth considering further.  I especially like it because it means the max total ICP supply inflation rate would always be known.

Hey @Kyle_Langham and @bjoernek it seems like @tiago89 brings up some great question as they relate to this forum topic.  I would love to see you guys add more clarity to these considerations.  Perhaps we should be looking into increasing cycle costs.  Also, why not consider increasing transaction fees?  Cycles and transaction fees are very inexpensive on ICP and it seem valid to question if that is really healthy.  It’s certainly a knob that can be turned to throttle the inflation concern if needed.  Perhaps we should consider higher cycle costs and transaction fees during the bear market while more development is happening and then dial back the cycle costs and transaction fees as the ecosystem enters a bull market where there is more consumption.  I’d be very interested in knowing if anyone at Dfinity has any insight along these lines.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2023-09-13 04:57:00 UTC | #49

Yes,

+1. It's important because it penalizes the excessive "rewarding". But we should be careful not to go the opposite direction, where voters would always reject and we ended up having a badly performant / risky network.

Also it's important to understand that in 5 or 10 years from now, the Voting Rewards will be less than the NP rewards (due to voting being lower and lower, while NP / Cycle burn will grow with usage). So we can't use absolute values.

Was thinking that maybe a good implementation would be measuring the difference between NP rewards and ICP burned (cycles+transactions), and the % difference is the penalty that Voting Rewards get.

So, in theory, if we are minting 500k, and we are only burning 50k (cycles + transactions), then Voting Rewards would be slashed 90%. This could be a 90 days rolling average.

There could be a "healthy threshold" where no penalty would come, like <20% or <10% diff.

For sure voters would quickly react on increasing transaction costs and cycle costs (and reduce NP rewards). The focus is on equilibrium, making sure that both sides are balanced. Which is a main responsibility of the NNS (and its voters).

Of course, such a transition would need to be gradual, phased out across 6 or 12 months.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-13 05:11:42 UTC | #50

Great response! You raise some legitimate concerns. Do you think it would work better if the donation was optional? At a pervious job, the company had a "hardship pool" where every employee could voluntarily donate a small amount of their check (the amount decided by them) to the pool. Then if someone faced a hardship, like their house burning down, the pool would help them out while they get back on their feet. Most people were willing to donate an amount that is inconsequential to them, but over the whole company, the total amount was significant enough to be useful. I, for one, would be willing to donate say 1% of my rewards to the pool in order to bring down the total inflation and contribute to the stability of the network.

Remember, the goal of this design is not to eliminate ICP minting entirely, but to reduce the amount that's minted specifically for node providers by establishing additional layers of funding, thus moving the threshold for a cascading failure to a position that's less likely to manifest in reality.

Jesse | 2023-09-13 10:57:14 UTC | #52

Agreed. The issue of more ICP being minted, transferred to exchanges and then sold as the price of ICP drops still persists, albeit at a slightly slower rate, since less rewards would be minted for stakers. 

The issue of run-away inflation wouldn’t come as a result of staker rewards as they are denominated in ICP. Any proposed solution in which staker rewards are cut in order to pay node operators does not resolve the issue. It merely kicks the can further down the road. I’m not saying such proposals shouldn’t be considered, since this issue resolves itself as the price of ICP increases. In the short term we just need to buy enough time to allow the price of ICP to increase, thereby avoiding catastrophe. It’s very possible that reducing rewards to stakers to cover node provider rewards could be sufficient for buying us that time. But we need to keep brainstorming.

As long as node provider rewards are denominated in USD, dispersed in ICP, the price of ICP is low and node providers are dumping their ICP on the markets, this issue yields the risk of runaway inflation.

The only real solution that follows sustainable economic principles is for the amount of node provider rewards to be less than or equal to the amount of ICP burned. Short term, this could be achieved by reducing the number of node providers. Mid/long term, this is to be achieved by increasing the amount of network activity on the IC. 

I do have a solution that could be enacted in the mid term (6-9 months). I’ve been working on an application that is meant to be deployed to the IC with many replicas so that each person within the ecosystem may have their own respective replica. Each replica burns anywhere from 0.2 T cycles to 1.2 T cycles per day depending on activity. It also offers neuron staking as a way for subsidizing cycles consumption. The cycles burned, as well as the neurons staked to subsidize the cycles burned add deflationary pressure to the ecosystem. If each person in the ecosystem were to receive their own replica of the application, I believe it would add enough deflationary pressure to the ecosystem in order to resolve this issue. The product also provides an economic incentive for anyone with a replica to onboard more users to their replica, thus growing the ecosystem.

I’ve already built the substantial amount of  infrastructure needed for delivering updates to the replicas.

The challenge is, the product is still a few months from its alpha launch. Also fostering awareness of the product to every member within the ecosystem would require support from dfinity. @bjoernek, @Jan , @diegop, I would love to be able to meet with dfinity about receiving support and fast tracking the release and rollout of this product.

I believe this is where the issue comes into play - when times are tough are when people will be least incentivized to contribute, when they’re most inclined to leave. 

[quote="Archetypal, post:50, topic:22949"]
I, for one, would be willing to donate say 1% of my rewards to the pool in order to bring down the total inflation and contribute to the stability of the network.
[/quote]

I agree with you, I would also donate 1% of my rewards to the pool in order to contribute to reducing Node Provider Inflation. However if we assume everyone contributed 1% of the 3.5M potential rewards from last month - that’s only 35k ICP, or enough to pay one larger scale node provider. 

With that being said, it is an interesting concept that should be explored further to determine how effective it’d truly be - it can’t hurt to make it optional.

[quote="Jesse, post:52, topic:22949"]
The only real solution that follows sustainable economic principles is for the amount of node provider rewards to be less than or equal to the amount of ICP burned. Short term, this could be achieved by reducing the number of node providers. Mid/long term, this is to be achieved by increasing the amount of network activity on the IC.
[/quote]


I also agree that this makes complete sense - Node Providers should be rewarded in correlation to the amount of ICP/Cycles burnt on their subnet. To make this feasible though, the amount of cycles burnt needs to exponentially increase. 

However, it is not possible to simply remove Nodes from the network. Each subnet consists of 13 Nodes, and if they begin to disappear from subnets, canister data will alongside them. Scaling down the Internet Computer is not a risk-less task. 

[quote="tiago89, post:43, topic:22949"]
I tried to make the math from the average of cycles burned per second (which is 5.3 B (not T)). And at a conversion rate of 2.2T per icp, this would give a burn rate of only 6.3k ICP (when we are rewarding +500k ICP of NP rewards). :thinking:

Please, someone confirm my math, but are we having a slippage of 98%?

[/quote]

Correct. If we can buy enough time in the short term to avoid catastrophe, the product that I’ve mentioned would be a viable solution for increasing cycles burnt to a level that’s sustainable for the ecosystem. 30,000 replicas, burning ~0.85T cycles per day would result in ~765,000 T cycles burned per month or ~357,696 ICP burned per month at $ICP’s current price. With more being staked to cover cycles consumption. The issue of run-away inflation has been on my radar from the moment i saw how node provider rewards are covered. I’ve been building this product with the health of the network in mind.

 Again, it is still months away from an alpha launch and would require support from Dfinity if I am to be able to fast track the roll out. @bjoernek @Jan @diegop

ICP's handling fees are unhealthy, it's like telling people I have a bigger, safer and more luxurious business center and our rent is free. I hope the DFINITY team will rethink whether it should increase fee income, and the corresponding burn rate should increase by a considerable percentage!

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-09-13 11:50:21 UTC | #56

Just wanted to point out that there are already plans for devs to face increased cycles costs in the form of query charging and increased cross-subnet call fees. 

I personally do not like the idea of increasing dev costs; that sounds a bit like cutting ourselves at knees.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-13 11:58:22 UTC | #57

I agree. Increasing cycles fees could very well have the effect that it destroys the business models for the projects that are currently on the IC. This is not a topic that should be discussed/implemented haphazardly.

I completely agree that this is something that should be explored further. I had planned on writing a discussion-piece on it, as @mechaquan has been rather persistent on the topic, although if someone else wants to start this conversation within another thread that would be great.
[/quote]

Yes, I think increasing cycle cost for computation and storage is one important part of a multi-pronged approach as this will bring actual burn closer to node provider rewards.

However, I think we should consider other changes in parallel like tx costs (this is an easy low hanging fruit), lower gov rewards inflation, ensuring node providers are paid for PoUW, paying rewards over time (ie in locked neurons), etc.

There's no silver bullet but all the potential levers should be defined with proper calculations and analysis of each followed by community/DAO votes.

mechaquan | 2023-09-13 12:16:00 UTC | #60

This point is not lost on me... make devs pay more = no more devs... not paying node providers = no more network...

Currently dev costs are being subsidised by the entire network... I'm happy to fund/subsidise dev work but shouldn't this be voluntary ie based on fundraising and not blanket subsidisation?

In my personal experience, cycles costs aren’t exorbitantly cheap. I feel that the current pricing for applications where updates calls are made often is reasonable. OpenChat, Distrkt and DSVR, among other apps with large amounts of user generated content, would possibly be put out of business if cycles costs are altered.

evanmcfarland | 2023-09-13 13:19:40 UTC | #63

Aren't node provider incentives aligned with a cap on their pay (e.g. 1M ICP/Mo Maximum), at least more than devs getting a price hike. With a dead network, their hyperspecialized hardware just turns into paperweights. Devs aren't tied to the network in this way and so placing the inflation burden on them seems unwise.

The ICP network, in it's entire existence, has burned 135K ICP. If your model has it burning 357K ICP/mo, aren't we talking about a 10X+ increase in hosting cost? 

If we can fix this by capping inflationary rewards, can a team member in this thread or other knowledgeable party address what NNS Proposals can and cannot change. Can tokenomics be changed to cap node provider rewards in one way or another? Also, if such a thing jeopardizes network integrity, why not just halt or taper NNS rewards when ICP goes below $3, for example. Neurons and Node Providers are the one's that should want this the most.

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2023-09-13 13:19:48 UTC | #64

This is just poor P&L management from a business point of view!

If INCOME (burn mechanism) has been about 75.000 Icp/year = 325.000$

We can’t have COSTS (node provider rewards + staking) of 75 MILLION $/year (5% inflation at 3$ icp)

It’s basic math… idk why crypto people are so off from a business perspective. They just rely on “price action” and “miraculous growth” but don’t take care of P&L fundamentals!

[/quote]

Not an increase in hosting cost. It’d be an increase in network activity. 

Currently, there’s only a few applications running on the IC. That means only a few applications are burning cycles. The reason being: to own, operate and maintain an application requires developer experience. The product I’ve built is an entire application that can be owned, operated and maintained without the need for developer experience. This means the number of people who own and operate applications in the IC ecosystem would go from a small number of dev teams, to every single ICP ecosystem participant. Consequently, the amount of cycles consumed would increase proportionately. I really think this is the best possible solution in the mid term and it should be more seriously considered. I’m willing to answer any questions anyone has regarding this.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-13 14:12:46 UTC | #68

This solution is the only one that addresses the problem at its root. The problem is, there aren’t enough applications running on the Internet computer. This is causing the inflationary pressures of paying node providers to be greater than the deflationary pressures that result from applications running on the IC. The Dfinity foundation has been trying to resolve this issue by attracting more developers- that is a slow process as developers seldom change their web hosting infrastructure. 

If growth in the number of applications running on the internet computer is to achieve sustainable rates, we cannot rely on attracting devs in the short/mid term.

The product I’ve built enables *consumers* to be able to run applications on the Internet Computer, thereby allowing the number of applications hosted on the IC to increase proportionately to the number of *consumers*  within the IC ecosystem as opposed to increasing proportionately to the number of *developers* in the ecosystem. There are far more consumers within the ecosystem than there are developers.

Burning ICP / Increasing ICP burn rate is not sufficient to offset the NP rewards sell pressure. 

Why? Because Burning ICP doesn't increase demand for ICP. 

Burning ICP, and Increasing Demand for ICP are not the same. They are related but burning doesn't always result in increased demand. 

What does burning ICP accomplish? It potentially reduces future sell pressure, and it contracts the supply. Potentially leading to more equilibrium in buy/sell ratio. But it doesn't necessarily lead to more demand to buy ICP.

Example: If everyone burned their ICP, this would reduce the supply, and it would reduce the amount of ICP available to be sold. So it could reduce total sell pressure. But this would have no impact on the amount of existing NP sell pressure. Only increasing demand for ICP can offset the already existing NP sell pressure. 

The theory that burning ICP will increase demand for ICP is flawed. Burning ICP can only indirectly lead to more demand for ICP if the people burning the ICP bought that ICP before burning it. If the people burning the ICP received it as a reward for staking, then burning it doesn't increase demand for ICP, it only reduces the supply, and potentially reduces the sell pressure. 

In order to increase demand for ICP through burning ICP, the ICP must be being burned for a legitimate reason by people who purchased the ICP and then consuming (burning) it to perform an activity on the network. 

Conclusion: When users receive ICP for free through staking rewards, and then burn it, it doesn't lead to increased demand for ICP. 

Burning more ICP than is created just leads to a contraction in the supply of ICP. It doesn't solve the problem of increasing demand. Increasing demand for ICP is the relevant issue to solve the problem of NP reward sell pressure.

Burning ICP and contracting the supply of ICP by slowing the inflation rate doesn't achieve this. 

Even if all other forms of sell pressure were removed through burning ICP, and only NP sell pressure remained, that would not solve the problem of increasing demand or buy pressure. 

Increasing burn rate, and thus reducing the supply of ICP might reduce total sell pressure if the ICP being burned would eventually make it's way to be sold, and thus it would potentially bring the buy/sell ratio into better equilibrium, but it wouldn't increase buyer demand by itself.

If the burnt ICP was purchased and then burned while being used to perform activity on the network, then that would create demand for ICP. However, increasing the cost of performing various activity on the network would only be feasible up to the extent that it doesn't reduce demand to perform the activity. Generally, reducing the cost of performing the activity would increase the demand, and raising the cost would reduce the demand. 

Therefore I am not sure how increasing the network costs would increase demand, it would most likely reduce demand, and that reduced demand would lead to less ICP buy pressure.

Jesse | 2023-09-13 14:42:08 UTC | #70

The product I’ve built allows the application members to be able to stake a shared neuron as a means to paying cycles costs. As their application’s activity increases, so too does their cycles consumption and as a result, they are incentivized to purchase more ICP off of exchanges & stake it in their app’s neuron as their cycles consumption increases.

So the question becomes: how does one incentivize purchasers of the application to onboard users to their application? 

The consumer who purchases the application is incentivized to onboard more users to their respective applications as a result of economic incentive. The application has a treasury that is governed by members who are permitted to join by the purchaser of the app. The purchaser of the application is the default admin. Admin receive 1% of all tokens deposited into the apps treasury and 1% of all tokens withdrawn. This is their incentive to onboard new users to their application and grow their treasury, consequently growing their activity, which grows their cycles consumption, which then requires them to purchase more ICP off of exchanges to stake within their neuron.

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-09-13 15:03:25 UTC | #72

I think it would be reasonable to assume that node providers receive rewards equal to 1:1 of the value of cycles burned by the subnet in which they participate. Initially, however, it can be established that, for example, 20% of voting rewards is a form of funding for node providers.
Additional token minting could only occur to cover the costs of running nodes in subnets that don't burn cycles (NNS or System subnet).

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-09-13 15:34:47 UTC | #73

With regard to increasing cycle costs. Many of us are making promises to clients and integrators based on current prices.  Making this burn rate volatile will greatly decrease the attractiveness of the IC.

9o0rl | 2023-09-13 15:35:46 UTC | #74

Ideally node provider hosting costs in data centers could be switched on/off as needed according to network demand, however I don't think data centers would allow this type of contractual agreement. Has anyone looked into this type of arrangement to assess feasibility?

Hi all, I've been following the conversation and love the idea brainstorming going on.  I wanted to share a bit more data to help guide the conversations and perhaps identify a timeline of concern.

Below is a chart of **FOUND** dissolving neurons on the NNS.  A neuron is "found" if the id is known by the dashboard.  "Found" neurons make up ~27.8M ICP of the 30.1M ICP dissolving in the next 12 months (see dashboard screenshot below) meaning that the bar chart below shows data that is, on average, 93% accurate.

![image|690x385](upload://kXVCreR7K9GCm5EkA4vd0cBtxeE.png)


![image|690x343](upload://gPcv7wzUsQTqo6vN7a5BxukZSDo.png)

For reference, the NNS has typically dissolved between 3 and 5M ICP, so the upcoming 5 months will be slightly below the previous 27 months.  There's a spike to 4.7M in March of next year, followed by a sustained downward trend for the next two years.  In the second half of 2025 we see practically no dissolving neurons.

In addition to this analysis, it's important to account for the **potential** for more dissolving neurons.  Below is a chart of the "found" locked neurons.  As would be expected, locked neurons tend to be aggregated around 6-month and 12-month dissolve delays.  Should these neuron-owners decide to dissolve, their neurons would be included in the charts above.
![image|690x390](upload://zjNxCXwkBkBKaoiAANYUJaF69H.png)

I'm adding this data to the conversation because I believe it is relevant to the conversation, however I will refrain from adding my analysis of this data in order to allow white-space for the community to discuss.

Let me know if you have any questions.

When contrasting it to the previously provided Inflationary Sell Pressure Information, it seems as though the reduction in staking outflow will do a few things:

One of which being greatly reducing the total potential sell pressure.

Alternatively, this drastically up-scales the percentage of inflation sold represented by Node Providers, which degrades the statement that this is a short term non issue as Node Providers don’t represent a considerable amount of inflationary sell pressure. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:41, topic:22949"]
I kept seeing you & @Kyle_Langham reference this as a non-issue in comparison to other forms of inflation, so I decided to aggregate current data to depict the reality of ICP inflation & an extrapolated future.

**Monthly N.P Rewards | 583,577**

**Monthly N.P Rewards Sent to Exchanges | 275,287.49**

**Monthly Un-Disbursed Maturity | 1,582,659**

**Monthly Disbursed ICP | 1,091,778**

**Monthly Staked ICP | -1,644,659**

From here, the total potential inflationary sell pressure on a monthly basis can be determined by adding the monthly disbursed ICP, Monthly staked ICP, and monthly rewards sent to exchanges - equating to a total of 3,011,724.49 ICP. It should be noted that this equation does not include Un-Disbursed Maturity, however this could also add to inflationary selling pressure.

This shows that as of present, Node Provider Reward sell-off equates to ~9.1% of the monthly inflationary sell pressure at current prices.

However, given Node Provider Rewards are paid in a static fiat amount, yet a variable ICP quantity, this data can be extrapolated to determine the contribution to inflationary sell pressure at the pre-determined points referenced within this article:

**Price - ICP to Exchanges - % of Inflation Sold**

**2.5$ - 385,627.6816 ICP - 12.3%**

**2$ - 482,034.602 ICP - 14.9%**

**1.5$ - 642,712.8026666668 ICP - 19%**

**1$ - 964,069.204 ICP - 26%**

**0.5$ - 1,928,138.408 ICP - 41.3%**

**0.25$ - 3,856,276.816 ICP - 58.4%**

The key problem behind this matter is why do we need so MANY NODES and why do we pay them SO MUCH. There shouldn't be more nodes right node and retribution should be variable depending on network INCOME(burn).
If there was a free market and on-boarding was easier there should be an auction to become a node at the lowest price.

-------------------------

smaug | 2023-09-13 17:15:13 UTC | #80

Here’s the ultimate solution, the perfect answer. I wish I’d thought of it sooner.

Choose a fixed amount to be minted each month and split it equally between node providers.

If price goes down the highest cost node providers will be the ones forced to shut down.

If price goes up, the increased rewards will incentivize new nodes to come online.

Problem solved. Set it to 200,000 icp per month, split between nodes.

Thanks for taking the time to craft a proposed solution! I also originally found this solution lucrative when beginning this dialogue, however it comes with some severe trade offs. 

Primarily, we’re talking about an immediate cut of 2/3 in Node Rewards. These funds are used to pay for the nodes themselves in most cases - so there needs to be a degree of profitability otherwise the Nodes will go offline.

In the instance Nodes start to go offline, at scale, the IC is going to run into serious issues.

Each Subnet is comprised of 13 Nodes replicating & verifying data in unison. 

If Nodes start to disappear from subnets, the requirement for consensus will drop & collusion becomes dramatically more feasible. 

Furthermore, if this happens to a large enough scale, and subnets end up going offline, this leaves us in a scenario in which we lose all of the Canisters & Data that are hosted on that subnet - which is debatably more catastrophic than an inflation spiral.

Jesse | 2023-09-13 17:36:43 UTC | #82

This would require people to be able to run nodes freely. The barrier to entry for running a node on the IC is too big in order to support such a fluid payment system. No data center would commit to purchasing the hardware needed to run an IC node with such risk of having to cease operations whenever the markets are down.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-13 17:44:18 UTC | #83

The IC needs node hardware that doesn’t require node operators to own entire data centers in order to contribute to the network. This would open the door for the possibility of node operators’ rewards being paid in a fixed number of ICP, as opposed to rewards being denominated in USD and dispersed in ICP. How feasible of a solution is this?

Dear DFINITY (cc: the other 20 or so people still reading this forum),

RE: I already said, “I told you so,” but I’m back to tell you one more time.

Okay, apparently, I’m a glutton for punishment, so I’m coming back to weigh in one more time despite the fact that I said this: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/absolute-majority-weight-proposal-draft/20368/66?u=fghostwriting would be my last forum post. Feel free to read it if you want to see my previous prediction of how and why the direction of the network was going from $4.00 to $0.04. It seems to have been completely ignored. Now that we’re under $3.00, I feel a lot like those scientists who warned about global warming decades ago, and now they have to get in their “we told you so’s” because it’s already too late, and they want someone to still be around to hear them say “I was right.”

So now it’s this business about the **node providers**. And I have to admit, I don’t even *remotely* have a solution. I hope the Foundation can fix it. After all, they set the blockchain up this way, so they must have had a plan in place in case the token price ever got this low, right? *R-right?*

I mean, Kyle and DFINITY’s representatives can say all day that we don’t need to worry yet, but *we do* and they know it and we know it and quite frankly, I think at this point, everyone knows it. We’re under the $3.50 threshold that Kyle warned about back in the day. And let’s be real, we’re not getting back above that number anytime soon. Even FIL is up today, and ICP is still down, breaking the link the two coins have shared for quite some time. The bear market could continue for months, another year, or more. It’s time for the “devs do something” outcry to get louder.

Accumulating has clearly shown the math. We’re *already* in the downward spiral. Something has to be done now, *or* *it’s over*. And to be honest, I’ve gotten to the point where I no longer believe it’s going to happen. Fortunately, I didn’t lock any significant amount of tokens up for eight years (the APR just wasn’t worth it). So, thankfully, I was able to take the huge L for tax purposes and go from having ICP be 95% of my crypto portfolio to a shrinking 20% (the ICP part is mostly in NFTs at this point because I trust pokedstudio with my money more than the Foundation).

The community begged for decentralization. The Foundation said it’s not time yet. *Fine*. Use your blockchain domination to get us out of this one before it’s actually over.

Signed,

All of us (probably)

To maximize cost reduction for node maintenance while maintaining decentralization, one simple approach is to decrease their quantity by removing those with the status "Awaiting Subnet" from the network. Additionally, it's advisable to limit the maximum number of nodes per Node Provider to, for instance, 10. It's also possible to slightly decrease the number of nodes per subnet.

AFAIK, over half of the nodes are currently inactive, which is a waste of resources. This is a pressing issue that DFINITY should prioritize and not overlook by flooding the market with seed investors.

It's great to see the ecosystem growing, and the foundation having resources for development. Those who bought ICP as VCs for $0.03 are still selling at a profit (and they will continue to do so until the network collapses). However, there are individuals who purchased at $4 or higher and are experiencing significant losses.

We have seen massive growth over the last few years within the Crypto and Wed3 startups.

The idea that you could run a company with large hype and no substance will create failures.

The three things that keep a business idea stable and into the future are investors, the business model and the ability to build profitability.

As inflation increases there are less funds available and startups will start to burn through their capital and when that happens they will fail.

The price of crypto is volatile and the effects are constant with all coins dropping in value and the price will return in the near future.

**The Business Model:**
It seems that the IC needs more infrastructure and that comes at a cost which is the concern of this discussion and on top of the developer costs.

Overseeing how this infrastructure is paid for is very useful but not the only consideration.

It seems interesting that developers benefit from providing their skills and with the capital to build their projects but the investors are poorly treated.

At this point I have no voting power and in this discussion, your own words, a spiraling to zero investment.

Currently this project needs a spark to encourage growth of not only investors but making it worthwhile for infrastructure providers for ongoing support.

**Profitability:**
The spark comes from the users of WEB3.
If they see a great use for a product then they will create profitability.

While I love the business model it acts like cybercriminals to its investors and provides no use case for WEB3 users.

We are currently a cable provider for potentially large WEB3 businesses that provide the spark for web3 users that will make their business profitable and the IC will be in competition with other cable providers, flying by the seat of our pants to survive and the backbone, with little reward.

Bitcoin (BTC) was created for several reasons, and its creation can be attributed to a combination of technological, economic, and philosophical motivations. Which are mostly not the IC which will never be seen or heard of. You want DFINITY to market their services which is what exactly, very little, mostly to those who need funding or creating projects on the IC that are already created by far more experienced organizations with a whole lot more investors and money.

The spark or the WEB3 users don’t care about the use case of this project they want to buy stuff.

BTC sells nothing other than trust and the ideal of a better currency because of the collapsing fiat currencies. That spark has the money markets excited to invest.

We need to see or know that our poor treatment by this project has some sparking good ideas.

As a node provider I am sensitive to both sides of the equation. 

What I would ask of the community is that if a cap is implemented or comes into effect, there should be a shadow tracker that accumulates all the lost rewards that node providers would have gotten. 

Then, the node providers can receive those rewards at a later date once the price goes above a certain threshold. They could also be given those rewards in 8 year neurons to avoid immediate selling at that point. 

Just saying, our node providers are the life support of the IC. No one wants a death spiral. But also, no one wants to disincentivize node providers from doing their work. 

Also, I’ve never ever sold a single token. Just fyi not all node providers sell.

Thank you for contributing a Node Providers perspective to the conversation - I believe that’s a very valuable input that we’ve not yet received within this thread. I hope other Node Providers take to the forums as well, to express their thoughts & concerns with this subject.

I believe a redemption system & neuron based payments are perfectly reasonable to explore, and if built correctly, offer a degree of reassurance to all parties involved regarding the potential of an inflation spiral.

I completely agree that our Node Providers are essential to this network & need to be rewarded and incentivized accurately. 

Have you seen any alternative solutions (to re-configuring the current node provider reward cap of 100k) within this thread that provoke further thought for you?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-09-13 23:13:52 UTC | #90

It is important for node providers to be paid fixed amounts in fiat during normal periods as our costs are in fiat. 

Unlike bitcoin, where nodes join and drop off all the time, depending on the profitability of mining, this is not possible for ICP. Our subnets only have 13 nodes each whereas bitcoin has one giant subnet. If node providers dropped out when it was no longer profitable because our node provider rewards were fixed on icp rather than fiat that could lead to entire subnets going offline and data being lost forever. That’s not feasible at all for a blockchain that wants to be a crypto cloud. 

I think a cap plus shadow tracker plus payment plan is the most responsible way to go. The details of it all should be in Dfinity’s hands.

If i were a node provider, i would prefer for the ICP price to temporarily decline in value so I could receive more ICP, and then sell it for a profit when the price of ICP goes back up. 

In my view, NP compensation plan should be aligned with appreciating ICP price rather than declining ICP price.

How can NP incentive structure be adjusted to coincide with an appreciating ICP price rather than a declining ICP price?

If the NNS allocated ICP and deposited a fund of ICP dedicated for NP compensation into a covered call option strategy, in the event of a ICP price decline, the covered call options returns would be used to pay for the node provider rewards **without having to sell or mint any new ICP**. On the other hand, if the price of ICP appreciated, and the covered call strategy was in the red, then new ICP could be minted to pay for NP rewards.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-09-13 23:59:49 UTC | #92

Not a bad idea. The insurance fund could be held in a stable coin so if it needs to be given to NPs during the bad times it would not lead to icp selling pressure

I support this idea. If this protocol is implemented, the lost rewards should be tracked and dispersed in a stable coin as opposed to ICP.

If the lost rewards are tracked in ICP and later dispersed in ICP, whenever that dispersement happens, it would transfer an unreasonable amount of control of the NNS over to the node providers every time the price of ICP dips.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-14 01:21:18 UTC | #95

This is a summary of what I believe to be the best solution proposed (thus far) for preventing an inflation death spiral as a result of Node Provider rewards:

1.) A cap is placed on the amount of ICP that may be dispersed as node providers rewards within any given month. 

2.) Any value owed to Node Providers that is unable to be met as a result of the ICP cap is to be tracked & denominated in fiat value. 

3.) The un-dispersed value owed to node providers is later dispersed once the price of ICP rises enough to issue the current and past-due payments to node providers while staying within the maximum cap on Node Provider rewards.

The monthly income of the subnet qdvhd....yqe is 39Tcycle, and the salary paid to the 13 nodes is indeed an ICP equivalent to 13360Tcycle. The difference in income and expenditure is 342 times. Investors have become slaves of the node merchants. To achieve balance of payments, Need to increase existing tank status to 18TB or reduce node supplier salary standards

This is not the solution. This is just debt restructuring.
What we need is that nodes become investors, not service providers.

Hello. Like DFisher I am also a node provider. Forgive me for recapping some basic thinking here - I think of tokens in terms of a supply/demand curve where the "market cap" is determined by the marginal sale.  The problem is that the supply curve keeps shifting out (Node Provider rewards, maturity) and the demand curve on the tail is steep at the end of the curve and shifting down for a bunch of reasons (e.g., Binance dumping, Gensler, Interest rate increases). The problem is that even existing holders of ICP will eventually capitulate by stopping additional investment and even dumping at prices lower than their view of intrinsic value if the marginal liquidations of maturity, node providers keep tanking the price.  

So, even a relatively small set of flows relative to market cap can tear apart an asset like ICP and drive value below intrinsic value.  I have startups that have gone public that are facing this same problem. It's a huge issue for them to raise without making it a lot worse.  

The Internet Computer has a lot of functionality coming out over the next couple of years, arguably the most advanced Web3 platform on the planet and a great community.  So raising money through monthly asset sales when there isn't sufficient demand for tokens is a terrible model. My thoughts are as follows: 

1. Hate the Maturity/Node Staking model - I have a lot staked at 4 and 8 years. The fact that I get maturity that can be unlocked is a terrible model. I tend to think of it like a bond with a high coupon. I am getting a reward monthly but then I can dump the rewards on the market.  Why does the network do that? The point is to lock up liquidity pools and reward those who believe in the network. This model rewards monthly liquidators!!! There has to be a better model and one that doesn't encourage dumping tokens monthly - at least one that pushes out the short-term pressure (e.g., you can't unlock maturity and sell it monthly). The high coupon encourages dumping. 

2. The Internet Computer is dirt cheap - it's like the old joke of losing money on every deal but making it up on volume.  We brag about how cheap storage is and transactions and then self-flagellate over the fact that it drives up inflation.  Not clear why we have so many really expensive machines but with the current pricing model, it seems almost impossible to "make it up on volume".  If we think we need that many machines, and that the dirt cheap pricing (I think there is room on pricing - e.g., a transaction on the IC is .0001 token, basically free to move a ton of value) is necessary then we have to either have services that generate a lot more income (ie another business like NFTs, exchanges, gaming, corporate subnets priced differently - selectively moving upstack in services to capture value and dealing with the ecosystem conflict). Or, we have to do a lot more to generate activity.  I haven't seen any focus groups but I have tried to use IC apps and the Internet Identity seems like a pretty big barrier.  We may be better than other platforms but even we don't eat our own dogfood. I am surprised that the community doesn't even post on our own native platforms but are much more active on X, Reddit, etc. 

Discouraging Node Provider ICP sales - I think measures to slow the pace of selling by providers is a good idea. But remember that Node providers are all in different positions - some sold everything right away, others have sold nothing. The machines do cost a lot and there are real fiat costs.  But if the community took a set of actions to slow selling of rewards or just asked them to participate more heavily in staking, that might work. But the node providers shouldn't be singled out.  It should be part of an overall solution that takes on maturity, burn rate, and node provider rewards.  

I do think that all of these solutions are really only temporary measures (we are kicking the can down the road) other than building activity on the network, increasing burn fees, and or adding higher-value services. It's basically betting that the platform will be sustained in a couple of years....

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-14 08:50:54 UTC | #101

It’s a debt restructuring that buys time for the token price to rebound, and upon rebounding, the debt is then paid off. This sounds like a solution to me. At the very least, it’s preferable to run-away inflation.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-14 09:20:50 UTC | #102

Great perspectives here! It's great that node providers are jumping in on the conversation. I completely agree: many of the solutions tossed around are band-aids at best and ignore the bigger picture, like we're constantly running around patching leaks in the pipes instead of fixing the plumbing entirely. What we need is a holistic solution, one that runs the gamut and focuses on not just financials but also relationships. So something covering voting rewards, transaction fees, new user and developer outreach and onboarding, node provider costs and relationships, strategic partnerships and integrations, and service costs.

To give this thought some more structure, perhaps we should turn the conversation away from node providers alone and align the conversation around these key areas:

**Voting Rewards**: There's another topic on this forum right now that's discussing how we can adjust staking periods and voting reward scaling to encourage more long-term commitment to the network. More lockups will decrease sell pressure. There's also the potential here for other solutions like adding variable vesting periods, or changing the time that spawned ICP takes to unlock from a static 7 days to a variable time period.

**Transaction Fees**: As it stands, the IC has a rather monolithic approach to transaction costs. A variable fee model could be introduced, based on transaction size, token price, and network demand. As the token price decreases, wouldn't it make sense to up the transaction cost (measured in ICP) to account for that? Additionally, someone sending large amounts of ICP can certainly afford to pay a large fee. While transaction fees will never be a massive source of burning, we can at least make them not absolutely trivial.

**New User and Developer Outreach and Onboarding**: This is about more than just marketing. It's about decreasing the barrier to entry for new users and developers, and creating an ecosystem that people want to be a part of. Simplified onboarding, extensive documentation, comprehensive and detailed tutorial series, and well-moderated community support channels. Additional developer grants and hackathons could act as incubators for talent and innovation.

**Node Provider Costs and Relationships**: This pillar is linked to the fiscal health of the network and the relationships it maintains with its key operators. Addressing inflation is not just a matter of balancing ledgers; it's a strategic endeavor that influences network reliability and growth. The question isn't merely "How do we minimize inflation?" but also "How do we extract maximum utility from every token minted for network maintenance?" as well as "How do we incentive node providers to be loyal to the network?"

Also, let’s consider how node providers interact with other stakeholders like developers, end-users, and investors. Facilitating a collaborative environment where there's regular communication and shared goals can amplify the benefits each stakeholder brings to the table. Joint ventures or collaborations, like we're seeing here on a micro-scale, can spark conversations and changes that lead to both network growth and additional revenue streams.

**Strategic Partnerships and Integrations**: There's a symbiotic relationship to be had with other platforms, especially ones that some developers are already using. IPFS, FIL, Arweave, Storj, perhaps even Chainlink or Ethereum. Think interoperability. The goal here isn't just to grow our network but to integrate it in such a way that it becomes indispensable to the broader crypto ecosystem. Strategic alliances could be formed based on mutual objectives: expanding user base, sharing technological resources, cutting costs, increasing performance, and co-marketing. These partnerships shouldn't just be thought of as transactions but as long-term relationships that provide value on multiple fronts. 

If ICP offers a good alternative to AWS for web 3 projects, then why aren't we seeing more and more services hosting their front-ends on IC?

**Service Costs**: The fee structure for the services provided by the platform—like storage, computational power, etc.—needs to be revisited. Perhaps we could employ a tiered system that scales based on usage. This would let smaller projects get their foot in the door without breaking the bank, while larger, more resource-intensive projects could be priced at a premium. This tackles the issue of underutilization of network resources and ensures that the platform remains financially viable.

These pillars serve as the foundation for a more holistic solution, one that doesn't merely slap on superficial patches but aims to reengineer the core dynamics of the platform and the ecosystem.

I agree that these are all just temporary solutions and that the only real solution is to increase network activity. 

The ecosystem needs time to grow to a point where its activity can sustain its costs of operation. It would be the role of the developers to increase network activity.

In my experience as a developer on the IC, the time we’ve had since Genesis until now has not been enough time to learn an entirely new tech stack and then subsequently create a finished product that is ready to deliver to the masses. OpenChat, Distrikt, and DSCVR are the ecosystem’s most refined products and they’ve all been under development since before Genesis and even they have kinks to iron out. Not to mention, they’ve had a ton of capital allocated to their development. The rest of us haven’t had such advantages. This is by no means a complaint. I say this to point out the fact that developing a product takes a lot time and money. And the less money you have, the more time it takes. 

The solutions posed here shouldn’t be discredited as merely “restructuring debt” or “kicking the Can down the road”, because any outcome that buys us developers more time to build, release, refine and promote our products is **extremely valuable**, and i can’t stress that enough. 

We’re just now getting to the point where we’re seeing alpha test launches being released: ELNA, Dragginz, EMC protocol, Kinic, Querio, etc… 

The product I’m created is an application that is designed to increase the amount of network activity by orders of magnitudes since it allows people with no coding experience to own, operate and maintain an application. Such a product literally makes it possible for there to be one application running on the IC for every consumer/retail investor in the ecosystem. We are doing our part to grow the network, but building an entire ecosystem from the ground up takes time. 

Any solution that we come up with that affords us devs the time to do our work is valuable and should not be discounted nor dismissed.

However, I can’t help but feel like when you divert attention from the core issue, being the potential for Node Provider Rewards to generate 9.6M ICP in excess inflation, we’re doing exactly this:

-------------------------

superduper | 2023-09-14 10:32:14 UTC | #105

it is real simple folks.

 you cannot have a massive $ denominated subsidy for node providers.  currently it is at the tune of near 50X ICP being created out of thin air for about 1 ICP being spent on cycles.

that is what will cause the spiral and that is what needs to be addressed.  the options are simple:

1. less nodes
2. pay nodes less
3. charge way more for cycles

-------------------------

superduper | 2023-09-14 10:34:31 UTC | #106

the problem is that node providers are already "investors" in many cases and their incentive is to dilute you and me for their own financial gain at the expense of neuron holders who don't have a financial interest in IC nodes.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-14 10:38:52 UTC | #107

Absolutely, your point about massive inflation is well taken. We can't place that issue aside entirely, but it does need to be looked in perspective of the entire network, and addressed simultaneously and with consideration of other issues if we're ever going to come to a resolution that benefits everyone and stands the test of time. Failing to do so we risk playing a never-ending game of whack-a-mole, and implementing solutions that fall apart or have unintended consequences elsewhere down the line.
