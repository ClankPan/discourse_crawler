I have a problem. I have dissolved the first 7 genesis neurons, and I have not obtained any reward. My dissolved neurons have all the same amount of ICP. The vote was not automatic? What could be happening?

the first 7 genesis neurons
[/quote]

A minimum dissolve delay of 6 months is required to be able to vote (and, consequently, to earn voting rewards). Your first 7 neurons had dissolve delays from 0-6 months. Not sure about the last one but the first 6 can definitely not have earned any rewards.

timo | 2022-01-07 13:23:29 UTC | #518

Good to hear that it works well. Thanks for the feedback. That was the goal after all - to let people access their neurons directly from a Ledger with the original seed phrase that was generated by the Chrome extension. Finally, that loop is closed. 

It was unfortunately quite difficult to make that happen due to the fact that the original "DFN address" was a legacy Ethereum-type address. The IC has evolved quite a bit since and doesn't natively understand those type of addresses. The IC's native ids are the so-called principals. The "claiming" process was required to translate from DFN address to principal.

Hi @timo !
Thank you for all explanation and help to the other guys. I was reading all 508 messages and it helped me a lot to claim my ICP with airgapped instructions. However, some basic Linux knowledge is required and I totally understand how frustrating claiming can be.
As I understand now, I am free to use 24 seed words in my Ledger Nano. That is a great news!

Regarding this first 6-7 neurons that do not earn rewards, does it mean that all the others do earn rewards? And already have earned some?

How can I check my neuron balance which includes rewards? From the claim page, I got this: “ *We are pleased to inform you that your neurons have been pre-aged! At the moment of Genesis Unlock, their age was already set to 18 months old. This is important, because neuron age significantly increases your voting power and the voting rewards you receive.* ”
But when I check my genesis account on ic.rocks, I see only the balance without any rewards.

Where can I find my ICP address which will show my full ICP balance on ic.rocks. There I can only see my genesis account? I am not sure I understand the difference. 

Why ic.rocks is not working at the moment? Is there any other explorer we can use?

you first 6-7 neurons should have been earning rewards it they where not dissolved yet as they where pre aged. They would have stopped if you would have chosen to dissolve them.

-------------------------

matherceg | 2022-01-10 13:35:24 UTC | #526

I have claimed my neurons using air-gap computer and then I used my seed phrase to recover LedgerNano S. Then I used this to login on nns.ic0.app and now I can see all my neurons. There are 49 of them, and none of them is dissolved. Cumulative there is total of ICP that is equal to what I have purchased during the seed round. So there is no rewards at all.
Where and how can I see these rewards?

-------------------------

jonit | 2022-01-10 14:33:27 UTC | #527

I don't know how to do this on the ledger but there is some code you can use in the terminal to see rewards, it is different for air gapped machines than connected ones.

I'm trying to follow along and understand what's been written lately.

Are seed investors able to claim their ICP/Neurons now using a Ledger Nano device?

If so, is there any clear documentation on how to do this?

Thank you.

-------------------------

matherceg | 2022-01-10 17:24:05 UTC | #530

Thank you very much. I have two questions now:
1. I should do this on the airgaped computer or can I somehow sign this command using ledger?
1. If I try to dissolve these 6 neurons, even though I don't see a proper amount in ledger, I will get reward dissolved? Why all of this is not visible in explorer?

Currently, none of the explorers work for me. Does it work for you guys?

Yes, all others will have earned rewards because they have been voting all the time even before you claimed due to their pre-configured following.

[quote="matherceg, post:523, topic:2765"]

[/quote]

The balance, i.e. the staked amount, hasn't changed. What has changed is the maturity measured in %. So you should see a positive maturity % on all neurons except the first 6. You can convert maturity to ICP by "merging" or "spawning".

[quote="matherceg, post:523, topic:2765"]

[/quote]

The "genesis account" mirrors the original token assignment from 2017 that was recorded in an Ethereum smart contract. That information is static. It will now change if you claim, earn rewards, disburse and move ICP, etc. It is also a single amount representing the whole amount of ICP. ic.rocks shoes them under the "genesis" endpoint, e.g. 
https://ic.rocks/genesis/2d89d96b10f7a9456a9154b2f5309ee70df5bce1
(which you probably already know and which probably is what are referring to).

Now, that amount has been divided into 49 pieces, belonging to 49 neurons, and each of these neurons has its own ICP account on the ICP ledger. Since neurons accounts are not public ic.rocks will not display them, unless in some cases in which it has reverse-engineered them by guessing the balance. The ICP balance of each neuron is best viewed in the NNS dapp.

Since you have already claimed you can now do _everything_ from the NNS dapp GUI while you Ledger hw wallet is connected. So whatever "this" refers to, no, you should not need an airgapped computer anymore.

[quote="matherceg, post:530, topic:2765"]

[/quote]

When you start dissolving nothing will happen except the timer starts to tick down. When the neuron is fully dissolved, i.e. timer it at 0, you can disburse the ICP. 
If you disburse and there is remaining unconverted maturity left then that maturity will be converted automatically first and then the entire amount, i.e. the original stake plus the newly minted reward ICP stemming from converted maturity, is being disbursed.

Because which ICP account belongs to a given neuron is not public information. You need to be the controller or you need to be one of the configured hotkeys of the neuron to be able to see it.

Hi ! Any news on anything related to claiming seed neurons in a user-friendly way via Ledger?
This is a bit of a bad look, are we still waiting for approval from Ledger Inc?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-03 19:33:29 UTC | #551

Let me ping folks working with ledger to find out.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-05-03 21:07:42 UTC | #552

Unfortunately no news. The update has been sitting with Ledger for months and months now.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-05-03 23:32:42 UTC | #553

Ledger has approved lots of other apps for much smaller chains recently.

ICP needs to put forth some effort to have Ledger approve this. Interact with a reputable company like Zondax who can help you move the needle on getting approved. 

The slowness and lack of any urgency to get this done is really disheartening. Ledger is not to blame here.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-06 02:16:17 UTC | #554

I think that’s fair criticism and it does *hint* that our routine of pinging and asking Ledger and Zondax is not enough. It’s healthy to see what (in the realm of what we have control of) can improve at.

It’s clear we should look at what we can do differently.

I do not work with zondax and ledger, but I think it’s fair we should iterate to see what we can do differently. Let me ping some folks.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-05-03 23:43:14 UTC | #555

I partially agree, but its not Dfinity's fault for sure, if Ledger approved the app to be listed on its platform they should guarantee updates are delivered in a timely manner, if they don't believe it's worth the hassle the app should't have been listed in the first place. Dfinity has its own business to care about, they shouldn't be losing time making sure another company does its job.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-05-04 07:05:11 UTC | #556

As you may know, we are working with Zondax; they programmed the IC application for the Ledger devices and are also interacting with Ledger to get the update in. Ledger even communicated planned dates for publishing the update to us, it just never materialized anyway.

-------------------------

Hey so when I hear about "seed investors still not being able to get access to their ICP", what's really been happening is that these people have been getting rugged by Ledger / Zondax until further notice?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-05 16:21:25 UTC | #559

I could be wrong (I’m not the expert in seed neurons), but I think that is not quite accurate characterization. I think a more fair characterization would be: “*seed round people can access their ICP (indeed I know many who have), but for those who want to use Ledger nano, the blocker is Ledger security reviews.”*

I think “rugged” is unfair because:

* implies that ledger nano is only way for seed round access (I could be wrong but I believe there is others)

* implies Ledger and Zondax have malicious intent they benefit from

As an analogy, I wanted to use Coinbase for staking because it would be easier, but I ultimately stopped waiting for a Coinbase to roll out this feature and moved to entirely self-custody (which requires more technical steps).

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-05 16:55:25 UTC | #560

That being said… as I said earlier, we realize we need to change something so we are discussing what we can do differently to help accelerate this.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-05-05 18:22:40 UTC | #561

It is extremely difficult for non-computer savvy seed round people to access their ICP. The instructions still aren't very clear. It's really sad because if it was made easy and accessible, those of us who invested over 5 years ago could have accessed our ICP at over $400. Now it's $12. The rug has been pulled. There's no other way to describe it.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2022-05-06 01:54:20 UTC | #562

If it helps you at all, I do not know one non-seed ICPer who realizes that the seed debacle is not due to DFINITY. This all seems to have flown very much under the radar.

-------------------------

davidhq | 2022-05-06 21:32:01 UTC | #563

Has it been clarified somewhere that manual (technical) seed claim instructions still work? 
Recently some balances have been swept into some neuron, not enough clarity about this.

Since we're still waiting for user-friendly way to do it and we don't know if we are going to wait for another week, month, year or decade it would be great to provide clear information about how to do it manually...

Some damage has been done but anyway seed investors have most of their tokens locked and released in tranches over the years as far as I know (?).. so the price effect that happened with more difficult way to claim is "mitigated" by having tokens locked... it's not the main issue but it's time for some clarity... again:

a) how to do it manually and is it still possible?
b) keep us up to date with any new info regarding the user-friendly way

I personally was busy with many other things and didn't take the time to follow long instructions ... and now the status of that is unknown.. along with status of b)

I think if enough care and attention is put into this now the issue can be somewhat resolved. It is what it is :)

[/quote]

There was also very little to no info about this. When investing in February 2017, there was no info about this. We were meant to get the tokens at genesis. We then waited 4+ years. Everything was done quietly and without much notice to the original group of people that funded the project at the very very beginning. I'm disappointed with how poorly it was done. Ultimately, I think preference was given to the VCs that invested in later rounds, and the seed contributors were shafted. 

Can someone please point me to the official release on the token distribution schedule for all participants.

The [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/hardware-wallet-cli) has now been open-sourced. Seed rounders can now do the following to claim their seed round neurons with a Ledger Nano:

1. Setup their ledger wallet with their existing private key.
2. Install the Internet Computer app on their ledger wallet.
3. Install the CLI tool: `npm install -g @dfinity/hardware-wallet-cli`
4. Claim their neurons: `ic-hardware-wallet neuron claim --hex-public-key <their-hex-public-key>`

This is the public key associated with your seed phrase, formatted in hex. To compute it, you can use [keysmith](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith/releases). Download it and run:

```
./keysmith public-key -f seed.txt
```

where seed.txt is a file that contains your seed phrase.

The tool `ic-hardware-wallet` has been updated. You can now simply call

with no arguments. It will compute the public key internally, so it doesn't need to be specified anymore. Some issue with the installation script was also resolved. See updated instructions including installation here: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Claim_neurons_for_seed_participants

Having this thread open for so long is kind of annoying. I think that we might not be listening to the actual problem of the ops(@seeround_donor , @oldseed ). Ops, please correct me if i am wrong below....(apologies in advance if i misunderstood)...

The main issue is that they literally do not know/understand what it means to do an "npm install...". 

Imagine me as a end user using Windows/Mac as a user mostly browsing on web, watching youtube/netflix etc. 

And suddenly you tell me, install the cli tool. I start to think (i am paraphrasing...), do i need to go to Home Depot, Lowe's? When you tell me , you can use keysmith (even when you show me the link to keysmith github page, it is all greek-n-latin). I look at the link in a horrified way...the README mentions a lot of files...which file do i download? What are these sha...files? Do i need a key smither?

I hope that you know where i am going with this. I think all of the instructions assumes a technical audience; where as some of the audience is just non-technical. I believe that producing a couple of videos of how to do this with Mac/ Windows step-by-step will help. We would need to start with the basics of how to open powershell etc...

Your comment @mparikh makes me realize I was not clear in my original intent:

[quote="diegop, post:588, topic:2765"]
can you please submit a support ticket and we can work through your questions on 1:1 basis?
[/quote]

What I *meant* is that **I encourage folks to submit support tickets where they can be paired with a support person** that can answer questions individually each person may have (no matter the technical level) at a much faster rate. I think there are folks for whom forum-based "i need help" open requests, may not be as helpful as 1:1 guidance with questions/answers.

My understanding was that they specifically asked what the "hex-public-key" was and why that argument was even there. Hence, we removed it because it was indeed unnecessary.

That said, a GUI tool is also being worked on.

Ok I might give this a go. Godspeed if I manage to lose all my ICP

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-18 15:32:45 UTC | #593

Alright, I've successfully claimed my 49 neurons. What can I do now???

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-18 16:34:13 UTC | #594

This is such a lengthy ordeal. I managed to add my 49 neurons, all individually, as hotkeys to the NNS app so I can see them. 1 of those 49 is unlocked, so I tried to disburse it.

> Sorry, there was an error. Please try again. Neuron ***************** is not kyc verified.

Now time to figure out how to kyc verify my neuron. I hope I don't need to do it for all 49 of them!

-------------------------

Ang | 2022-07-18 16:35:44 UTC | #595

Can you send an email to support@dfinity.org and we can check your kyc approval status to make sure the neurons have been unlocked.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-18 16:38:32 UTC | #596

I've never gone through any KYC. Where do I do it?

-------------------------

Ang | 2022-07-18 16:39:26 UTC | #597

Send an email to the above address, I will send you the link via the support channel.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-18 16:43:12 UTC | #598

I think you are a scammer

Dfinity is spelled wrong, and there's no reason to send an email to do KYC. I'm confused.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-18 16:43:34 UTC | #599

He is a forum moderator and Dfinity employee.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-18 16:45:29 UTC | #600

Fair enough. Thanks.

I can see they are unlocked in the NNS. I don't need confirmation from support that they are unlocked. Isn't there a public methodology for ICP users to go through KYC? Can't a link simply be provided?

-------------------------

Ang | 2022-07-18 17:01:26 UTC | #601

You can take a look here for public instructions on how to submit the kyc form: https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/5006142379284-How-do-I-submit-a-KYC-application-

oldseed | 2022-07-18 17:04:46 UTC | #602

Confused by this....

That's the address that the Chrome extension generated for you during the donation phase. The Chrome extension labeled it "DFN address" that's why it has this name here. It says "Ethereum address" because the DFN address looked like an Ethereum address (40 hex characters) and is actually compatible with Ethereum addresses. 

To be precise the DFN address in the Chrome extension included an 8 character checksum, i.e. it was 48 hex characters long. You can cut off the last 8 characters or input the whole thing. I am guessing that both will work.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-18 18:04:48 UTC | #605

Unfortunately no longer have that. I have the 12 word mnemonic. How can I get the "DFN address"

-------------------------

timo | 2022-07-19 14:33:44 UTC | #606

Ok, we’ll add that to the tool ic-hardware-wallet. That’s the tool you used to claim, or?

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-19 14:47:20 UTC | #607

I followed these directions with my hardware wallet.

https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Claim_neurons_for_seed_participants

I've then added the 49 neurons as hot keys to the NNS app, but now I can't do anything because I'm not kyc verified.

There were no instructions on what to do next. I've since figured that out through separate research, namely here and email.

I believe I now have my DFN address via an air-gapped computer. We'll see if it works. It would be helpful for others if there was 1 set of instructions from start to finish.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-19 23:53:29 UTC | #608

I've added my hardware wallet to https://nns.ic0.app/#/accounts 

It shows my Principal ID for that address.

I added each of my 49 neurons as hot keys to the NNS dapp.

However when I click to the Neurons section, it shows a different principal ID.

I'm not clear which one to enter at the bottom of the kyc application.

over a year after creating this thread and you still don't have complete access. astounding. you should be irate and dfinity should be ashamed

This is the one you use in the KYC form.

This is not the one you use in the KYC form.

Explanation: The first one is the principal that is associated with the hardware wallet and which is the controller of your neurons. The second one is the principal that is associated with the Internet Identity that was used to log into the NNS dapp. You can, but don't have to, add the second principal as a hotkey (which I think you said you have done). If you chose to do that then you can from now on vote with all your neurons without having to attach the hardware wallet again. If you chose to not do that then every time you want to vote you have to attach the hardware wallet again.

To explain this further: You could have several II anchors and for each of them you can log in and add an account that is linked to your hardware wallet. Then the first principal (the one shown when you click on the account that is labeled "Hardware wallet") will always be the same no matter which II anchor you used to log in because it is linked to the hardware wallet not the II. But the second principal (the shown at the very to when you open the "Neurons" tab) will differ from II anchor to II anchor because that one is linked to the II not the hardware wallet.

Thanks. I need a direct line to support as this is becoming a complete nightmare.

I went through the KYC process and received an email reply: Hello, Your identity has been verified and there are no further actions required.

I then tried to disburse my unlocked neurons and received the same message as before

I don't know what else I can do. I was one of the first supporters of this project back in February 2017 and have been left holding the bag. The VCs who invested after were given preferential treatment and all made off like complete bandits when ICP was $400-$600. Here I am unable to even access my balance and after 5+ years, the value is only slightly above the value of the ETH that I contributed. This has been a very frustrating experience.

-------------------------

timo | 2022-07-20 16:37:31 UTC | #614

The message you received was from Dfinity’s kyc system. Now Dfinity has to make a kyc proposal to the NNS and the NNS has to vote it in. Only then is the kyc flag in the neurons set to true which will then allow the disburse transaction. It used to be that the kyc proposal happened weekly.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-21 17:59:50 UTC | #615

It worked! I was approved and was able to disburse 1 unlocked neuron. I still have 48 neurons with various locking periods from 48 days to 3 years and 340 days. How often do they unlock?

-------------------------

Ang | 2022-07-21 18:50:19 UTC | #616

The dissolve delay on the remaining 48 neurons are spaced one month apart for the next 48 months. However, they won't start dissolving and counting down until you click start dissolving. You can view all this from the NNS app.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2022-07-21 18:52:00 UTC | #617

Thanks. So if I dissolve them all now, the countdown will start?

What's the benefit to not starting the dissolve process?

-------------------------

Ang | 2022-07-21 19:00:27 UTC | #618

Yes it will start when you dissolve. Your age bonus will be reset to 0 when you start dissolving and for neurons with less than 6 month dissolve delay you won't earn any rewards. 

See here: https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/4404284302612-Age#:~:text=A%20higher%20age%20enhances%20your,bonus%20will%20stay%20the%20same.
