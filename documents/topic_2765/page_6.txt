Thanks. 

At what point can I keep my age bonus and rewards? 

---

As a seed person, I understand my neurons were automatically voting before. Since I've now claimed them and added as hot key to NNS dapp, do I need to vote myself to continue earning rewards?

You can check the neurons vote history in the nns app or by pulling up the neuron id on the dashboard: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons

You can also check in the NNS app to see which neurons it is following for voting purposes.

congrats for getting hold of your ICP! it has been a nightmare for most of us! i wish we had the chance to control our neurons in a easier way and before..
in regards of rewards for voting, if you follow the foundation you might get less rewards as they arent voting for everything so, either you vote manually every time or you follow other neurons as well so you are covered and can vote everytime. I learnt on my skin that following others could be counterproductive and the vote can be against your own interests, so pay attention on who you chose! have fun in the NNS!

thanks.

At what point can I keep my age bonus and rewards? Seems I lose them if I dissolve.

There is no link to the seed round access instructions in the header of this topic?

I just want to note besides Timo’s update on “Claiming via Ledger Nano”, the DFINITY support team is able to help any remaining people who may be stuck by submitting a support ticket (not a public forum):

https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/requests/new

The support team is expecting questions about claiming and can answer any technical questions folks may have.
