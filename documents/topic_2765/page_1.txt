If terminal identity and GUI are incompatible. How are people supposed to manage the neurons from the cli?

Will it be possible to do load the terminal identity from gui in the future? ETA on when it will be possible? Is there a reason it's not currently possible?

How do you follow proposals from within the the cli SDK?

By default are seed neurons configured to follow foundation voting or does it need to be configured to follow / vote?

I think dfx canister send doesn’t have --output option, that’s why this doesn’t work.
Any fix for the claim-in-two-steps approach?

Like you said, from the cli. And yes, unrealistic. Dfinity essentially just locked out 25% of it's nervous system from realistic use. It becomes whatever the foundation want to do.

Good luck to you! And also, you're exposing your key the entire time you need to sign anything, even on an airgapped machine. That key is stored unencrypted, yay.

Just starting to look at the seed instructions I really dont know where to start. One thing is at the end of the instructions there is no explanation as what you should expect to happen at that point, any ideas?

Wow is this really true? I can't believe they would not give seed people another way to interact with their neurons. Especially after emphasizing the importance of participation and New ways to authenticate using more secure authentication methods.

0xbb | 2021-05-11 20:20:58 UTC | #109

Can someone from the Dfinity team please suggest a fix for this? I have my result as a hex string and am not able to access my neuron ids. Happy to use any other library to decode the result or convert the hex into a format that can actually be decoded by `didc decode`.

Has anyone finished all the claim steps,  passed the KYC and got their ICPs？

-------------------------

hshadab | 2021-05-12 15:13:36 UTC | #111

My big picture understanding of the token disbursement process (which may not be entirely accurate) may be helpful:

1. Disbursement means to move locked/staked ICPs from a governance cannister/neuron to a ledger cannister/account.  

2. So when you complete the final step in the [Neuron/ICP Instructions for Seed Participants](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html) and disburse ICP from neurons that are fully dissolved (unstaked), you are moving your ICPs to your ledger cannister/account. I don't believe you can "disburse" directly to an external ICP wallet on an exchange. See [here](https://medium.com/dfinity/getting-started-on-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-app-wallet-61ecf111ea11) (when a neuron is instructed "to disburse the neuron’s stake...[its] locked ICP balance is transferred to a specified new ledger account"). But see 4 below on this.

3. It does not seem like there is any confirmation of completing the ICP disbursement step, other than perhaps getting a message.json file in your current directory. It seems like you have to just check the token balance in your ledger cannister/account afterwards to confirm you correctly disbursed your ICPs.* This is done by entering the following at the command line: **dfx ledger --network ic [ledger account-id]**.   You can also query one of your neurons to learn more about it by entering the command shown [here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html#_neuron_identifiers). Based on [this doc](https://medium.com/dfinity/getting-started-on-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-app-wallet-61ecf111ea11), a neuron query should tell you things like the neuron's age, the neuron's ledger account where the locked ICP balance resides, and whether the neuron has been dissolved (unstaked). I'm not sure if querying a neuron will tell you its amount of locked ICPs.

4. After disbursement, you should be able to transfer the unstaked and disbursed ICPs from your ledger cannister to an exchange by following the instructions in [Self-custody quick start - Transfer ICP tokens to another account](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/self-custody-quickstart.html).

**If anyone can please clarify if there's a way to confirm that neurons were disbursed**  (e.g., a confirmation message, something in a message.json file) that would be very much appreciated.

*Note: your ICPs are distributed equally among your neurons. So divide your total ICP balance on the network (staked and unstaked) by your number of neurons (here 31 or 49) to know how many ICPs you are unstaking and transferring to your ledger cannister/account in any given disbursement process. You can check your total ICP balance (not just in the ledger account/cannister) by using: **dfx ledger --network ic balance**. See point 4 in https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html#_connect_to_the_ledger_to_get_account_information - Connect to the ledger to get account information.

hi bro~  Did you get the "xargs: illegal option --d" error while disbursing?

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-12 16:34:12 UTC | #139

I managed to get around the xargs issue by running the xargs part of the command on Linux. Mac xargs doesn't support the -d option.

But in the result, I get this error:

    "The recipient's subaccount is invalid due to: Received an invalid AccountIdentifier proto containing a field 'hash' of length 32 bytes instead of the expected 28.";

Anyone else had this problem?
My ACCOUNT_ID is 64 characters, and after parsing it comes to 32, so that makes sense, but I don't know why 28 is 'expected'.

-------------------------

Tomo | 2021-05-12 16:30:17 UTC | #140

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-12 16:34:04 UTC | #142

I think the first neuron is already dissolved. I received an error when trying to dissolve it.

     record { error_message = ""; error_type = 6 : int32 }

-------------------------

tavroh | 2021-05-12 16:41:11 UTC | #143

I received an email that my KYC is has been verified, but when I try to disburse my neuron, I get this message: error_message = "Neuron xxxxx is not kyc verified."; Does anyone have the same issue?

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-12 16:58:53 UTC | #144

Is there any documentation for these canister functions? For example "manage_neuron"? What is error_type 6 and 3?

Why does disbursing want a 28 byte account ID, when account ID is 32 bytes?

    The recipient's subaccount is invalid due to: Received an invalid AccountIdentifier proto containing a field 'hash' of length 32 bytes instead of the expected 28.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2021-05-12 17:08:12 UTC | #145

Is there an easy and safe way to check if our 12 words work and how much ICP is allocated to us?

I don't want to transact or do anything, I just want to confirm my 12 words actually work and I have the amount of ICP I recall having.

I didn't write down the DFN address back in 2017, just my 12 words.

-------------------------

claire | 2021-05-12 17:17:55 UTC | #146

oh god! Thank you so much! Linux does work. But I didn't get your error. I check that my accountID is also 64 characters. Weird......     Maybe retry from the beginning?

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-12 17:19:03 UTC | #147

They updated something in the docs now to fix the error with account id. But now I get a different error:

As far as I know that is the correct address to use for KYC.

It seems quite a few people have this KYC issue, the Dfinity team should provide some support channel for seed contributors in my opinion. To resolve this issues asap, because already they kinda screwed us over on the whole launch. It really left a bitter aftertaste, when we could instead be excited about the technology and good investment. I planned not to sell much ICP, but after this attitude I already dumped what I could and dissolved several neurons. Even if I believe in the tech.

Hello,

I'm stuck at the claim step

I ran the `dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet send message.json` command on my networked machine and all I received was a "Request ID"

I've since tried to interrogate this Request ID with the command `dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet request-status <Request ID> renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai` but it just hangs and I never get any response on the command line.

I can't find any information about Request IDs or how to use them. There isn't anything in the seed instructions about receiving a Request ID. Wasn't I supposed to receive a list of Neuron IDs?

Please help.

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-05-12 22:47:26 UTC | #168

It's been changed back and forth. Someone had suggested it a day ago as a solution and then they updated the directions with it I assume without testing because it wasn't working. Looks like it was reverted back and steps changed in some places. Glad they figured it out.

Same problem here. Since the command line was changed just yesterday they didn't add to the instruction what to do with the Request ID or how to query the neuron ID's. Already curious how to send ICP tokens (once dispursed) with air gapped method to another account. Couldn't find any information related to this topic. We are getting there, fingers crossed.

You should be able to transfer disbursed ICPs from your ledger cannister to an another account in the ledger (and I think to an external exchange) by following the instructions in [Self-custody quick start - Transfer ICP tokens to another account ](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/self-custody-quickstart.html).

Interesting observations!

Got it. Would that command work for sending disbursed tokens to an ICP wallet on an exchange?

-------------------------

curacao | 2021-05-13 02:44:42 UTC | #184

I guess transfer should be possible directly to exchange wallets. Anyhow should be tested with a small amount.

Hey folks,

Thank you for your patience and for your community engagement. As a reminder, this is a developer forum, so please avoid token speculation. Our teams are working on pushing updates to tooling and documentation and we appreciate your patience.

I will try to collate general questions and provide feedback to common questions.

Useful links:

* Seed documentation at https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html
* Keysmith utility at https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith
* The KYC portal can be accessed here https://kyc.dfinity.org/gtc
* Official Internet Computer support hub http://support.dfinity.org/

**Issue**:
> “I was hoping there would be hardware wallet support as I’m really not keen on entering my seed anywhere online, or handing it over to any trusted third party.”

**Comment**: We are working hard on hardware wallet support and it is a high priority for our team. Unfortunately for hardware wallet support is still under development and review processes. The safety and security of your private key is your responsibility and there is no substitute for planning ahead, bringing the right equipment, having the right skills, and using good judgment. We strongly recommend you proceed using an air-gapped computer to reduce the risk of having your private key compromised.

**Issue**: `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (psycopg2.errors.NotNullViolation) null value in column “token_holder_id” violates not-null constrain`t when submitting KYC documents.

**Comment**: This was a bug in the KYC workflow and has been hot fixed by the team. If you are still encountering this issue please open a [support ticket](http://support.dfinity.org/).

**Issue**:

> I can also confirm that there is no email confirmation. Will we be notified by email when the KYC is complete? And how long can we expect this to take?

**Comment**: We have updated KYC workflow to email automated updates. Previously, we took a "no news is good news" approach, but folks found this confusing.

**Issue**:

> If I try to disburse I get a “`Neuron XXXXX is not kyc verified.`



**Comment**: The updates to the Foundation Ledger may take up to one business day. If you are still encountering this issue after 24 hours of being KYC approved please open a [support ticket](http://support.dfinity.org/).

**Issue**: `version ‘GLIBC_2.29’ not found`

**Comment**: Please upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu 20.04

**Issue**: `Invalid character ‘x’ at position 1 error.`

**Comment**: The documentation at this step was incorrect and has been updated now.

**Issue**: `record { error_message = ""; error_type = 6 : int32 }`

**Comment**: The error codes for the governance canister are documented in the ic_nns_governance code [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/024de2fc73d7f6f5df5a92edf9675851f9ebbf59/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L749). Hopefully this can provide hints when interacting with the governance canisters.

Thank you for look into it.

I'm following the two-step to claim neuron IDs.
Use the latest command to send message, I got a Request ID, but what next?
dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet send message.json

Is there should be a didc decode command too?

-------------------------

tavroh | 2021-05-13 04:57:04 UTC | #187

I've inspected quite a lot of mine and they seem to be in a consecutive order already.

-------------------------

kkslider | 2021-05-13 05:51:07 UTC | #188

Thanks for attempting to be helpful. Are the seed instructions intended to only be run on Ubuntu 20.04 (and not, for example, MacOS, Debian, Arch...)? I'd assume this is the case given the `xargs -d` flag that is not supported in MacOS. If so, why is this not explicitly called out in the docs?

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-13 06:10:48 UTC | #189

Thanks for the response @ililic! Good to know someone is listening out there!

-------------------------

curacao | 2021-05-13 08:14:53 UTC | #190

Thanks Igor for being around :). Regarding Enzo's latest update for air gapped neuron claim (*dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet send message.json*) could you please clarify **how to make the neuron ID's visible**? Don't know what to do with result which is a request ID. Thanks a lot!

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-05-13 10:47:27 UTC | #191

Same question. After sending the message.json I received a Request ID. I am using Bash on Mac OS Big Sur. For those having this issue what OS are you using?

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2021-05-13 11:15:42 UTC | #192

I am trying the airgapped approach.

I am following this guide and am at the claim neurons step:


At the networked computer:
`./dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_account '("$MY_ADDRESS")' --output=raw`

returns a hexadecimal. It's saved in `$RESULT`

Then this is passed to:
`./didc-linux64 decode -t "(Result_2)" -d ./nns-ifaces-0.8.0/genesis_token.did $RESULT`

And I get an error here: `(variant { Err = "Account not found" })`.

How can I proceed?

-------------------------

[/quote]

That's easier said than done. Updating an already air-gapped computer to the latest version of Ubuntu is not possible. You need to buy a new computer just for this process. Which is slow, takes a lot of work and is less than ideal.

Instead you should provide the ability to build from source so that you don't have glibc incompatibility problems. Building dfx on an airgapped machine should be how this process is done.

-------------------------

Tomo | 2021-05-13 11:27:45 UTC | #194

hi, "call" can be done by airgapped approach? All airgapped approach seems to be "sign" and "send" ?

-------------------------

hshadab | 2021-05-13 14:58:38 UTC | #195

@ililic Can you please include examples in the seed instructions? Examples such as those below in the [Self-custody quick start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/self-custody-quickstart.html) are enormously helpful and reduce errors and help requests tremendously. This is especially true for multiline commands such as calling the cannister, etc.

Here is the delay time of my neurons:

1 -       dissolve_delay_seconds = 0 : nat64;
2 -       dissolve_delay_seconds = 5_046_278 : nat64;
3-       dissolve_delay_seconds = 6_317_585 : nat64;
4 -       dissolve_delay_seconds = 10_200_723 : nat64;

Did anyone else check their neurons dissolve time?

THANKS TIMO

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-05-13 13:08:13 UTC | #198

Looks like there are more detailed directions here https://github.com/dfinity/docs/blob/master/modules/token-holders/pages/seed-donations.adoc#claim-in-two-steps

> Unlike `dfx canister call` in the section [[Claim in one step]](https://github.com/dfinity/docs/blob/master/modules/token-holders/pages/seed-donations.adoc#Claim in one step), the command `dfx canister send` does not return output that can be parsed by `didc` . Instead, it outputs only a request id.
> 
> In order to see the effect of your `send` request, you have to do an additional step. Perform the following commands on your networked machine:
> 
> CANISTER=renrk-eyaaa-aaaaa-aaada-cai RESULT="$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_account '("paste legacy address here")' --output=raw)" didc decode -t "(Result_2)" -d ~/Downloads/nns-ifaces-0.8.0/genesis_token.did $RESULT

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-05-13 13:25:09 UTC | #200

No problem. Too many places to check to get consistent info. Take a look again, it's different from the directions on dfinity.org/seed. There is additional detail mentioning what to do after you receive the Request ID including sending the message above with your legacy address. That's not on dfinity.org/seed

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-13 14:43:09 UTC | #201

Thanks Timo for the updated instructions! 

@ililic Further questions:

1. Can someone please explain how to decode or interpret these 'nat64' values? Can didc convert these into human readable numbers? I can't find any useful instructions on this in the docs or the forum.

2. Where can we see how many ICP tokens are locked inside a Neuron and why isn't this information included in "Neuron Info"?

3. What do the values of the "state" property (e.g. 1, 2, 3) mean? Is there any reference for these neuron APIs? I can't find anything.

4. How can we tell what the original amount of ICP in a neuron is vs the amount ICP earned in rewards? How come this also isn't in "Neuron Info"?  Is there a different place to get information about Neurons other than "Neuron Info"?

Many thanks

As far as I know they already are human readable numbers (decimal). For example when converting the account_id to the nat64 values, you take 2 characters, treat that as a hex number and convert it to decimal. And that's the nat64 value. At least that's how I remember it encoded the account_id.

Or if you're talking about the delay number, it's in seconds, so you need to divide by 60 * 60 * 24 to get days.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-13 14:51:53 UTC | #203

This doesn't seem human readable to me. What does this mean?

[quote="SyBer, post:196, topic:2765"]
3- dissolve_delay_seconds = 6_317_585 : nat64;
[/quote]

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-13 14:53:13 UTC | #204

Seems quite humanly readable to me.
dissolve delay seconds = 6 317 585
so that's 105293 minutes
or 1754 hours
or 73 days.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-13 14:56:02 UTC | #205

Oooh. So those underscores are like commas. Okay got it. Not sure how we are supposed to just understand that. There are no nat64 examples in the documentation or the forum.

[/quote]
Because they only made developer tools, meant to be used by programmers, because they don't care too much about seed investors selling their tokens or doing pretty much anything. The harder they make it for you to sell, the better price the team and their Venture Capitalists can get. Why do you think they only enabled the KYC form right at launch and then took another day to verify it... If they didn't do that you could get $600 per token like they did :smiley: I'm pretty sure that was illegal by the way.
PS: no offense to the devs at all, it's not their fault but the greedy management

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-13 15:02:24 UTC | #207

Sure I get that. But how are even developers supposed to understand? Are they going to some secret documentation location that the rest of us aren't? Or basically they are in a Motoko environment where they can create their own examples... That's probably it. Yeah completely developer-centric which is understandable and fine for now. Always learning.
