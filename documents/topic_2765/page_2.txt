Did you solve this problem now?

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-13 15:05:28 UTC | #209

Claude1 using "_" as no-effect number delimiter is pretty standard in many programming languages. So for most developers it would be immediately obvious. But yeah there should be some documentation of these canister functions. Especially when you try something and you get error "3".

hey, Anyone who received the kyc verified email before but still got the "Neuron XXXXXXX is not kyc verified." error, succeed now? It's obviously more than 24hours. I've opened a ticket but obviously no immediate response. Just want to check that waiting is useful .......

Nuno | 2021-05-13 15:26:15 UTC | #215

I'm on that boat as well. Have contacted support with the following answer:

> If you received an email confirmation stating that your identity was verified there is no further action required on your end. It may take 1 - 2 business days for your information to be updated in our systems which is likely the cause of the error message you received.

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 15:57:26 UTC | #216

The number of seconds before the neuron will be dissolvable.

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 15:58:26 UTC | #217

Anyone has similar issues? Any way to resolve it beyond just going over each and every neuron?

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 15:59:56 UTC | #218

Also, are there any plans to allow seed change including migration to hardware wallet?

Being vested for 4 years with the same seed presents a lot of risks, especially as it's unclear how ledger will be supported for the seed claimers.

-------------------------

Wally | 2021-05-13 16:27:42 UTC | #219

KYC was approved more than 24H. Still not able to withdraw/dissolve.

error_message = "Neuron xxxx is not kyc verified.";

-------------------------

Wally | 2021-05-13 16:30:12 UTC | #220

I have the same issue. KYC was approved more than 24H and the same error. Please let me know when you know more.

same here KYC issue when I try to disburse

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-13 20:16:45 UTC | #222

I made a helper script to show you info for all your neurons, like dissolve delay (calculated to days, hours etc), age, voting power, state. You can find it, with instructions, here https://github.com/applepiesoft/DfinityManager
It only uses get_account and get_neuron_info, it does not make any calls to change anything, but you should check the source code yourself and decide if you want to use it or not.

Only run what you have checked to be safe, I don't take any responsibility for any damage. The script is provided as-is.

The script should work if you do not have a private key / seed in use/installed. So I really recommend to **run this on a computer where you did not import your private key**! Then you don't need to risk anything. Note you still need to install the dfx SDK first, but keysmith is not required. If you use the air-gapped method, simply run this on your networked computer (no private key) and nothing bad can happen.

PS: at this moment the script might not work if you put it in folders with spaces or weird characters in the folder names. also, if you get network errors (e.g. 504 Gateway Timeout), try again.

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2021-05-13 18:28:59 UTC | #223

Problem solved. 

`RESULT="$(./dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_account '("$MY_ADDRESS")' --output=raw)"` needs to become `RESULT="$(./dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_account '("'$MY_ADDRESS'")' --output=raw)"`

Notice the extra ' around the address variable

-------------------------

mac | 2021-05-13 18:49:16 UTC | #224

That looks great. Thanks.

Do you also have any idea what commands to run to see the ICP lock balance and the ICP reward balance of a given Neuron?

-------------------------

curacao | 2021-05-14 01:42:54 UTC | #225

I guess voting power is an approx indication of how many tokens are locked but I don't have any command ready. 

Was someone successful to dissolve a neuron with air-gapped method? If I run the commands from the manual nothing changes in the neuron state.

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 19:42:05 UTC | #226

Great work, just to note that sending ICP via dfx does not appear to be protected in any way for now, hence a malicious version of the script can snatch all the claimed tokens under the current identity.

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-13 19:45:46 UTC | #227

Absolutely. Hence I wrote that you should check the source code before running it (or decide not to run it, of course).

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 19:45:17 UTC | #228

Btw, it works indeed under the default identity :+1:

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-13 19:47:00 UTC | #229

Also, I believe you can run this script on a computer where you did not import the private key / seed. But I did not check.
If anyone tries that please let us know. So to run it in a way where access to the wallet keys is not possible. (dfx SDK must still be installed of course)

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 19:50:01 UTC | #230

It seems to be possible, as I removed the seed / private key file / identity.

Btw, the 1st neuron appears as dissolved in your output, thought it only happens after you actually claim it?

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 19:51:42 UTC | #231

Might want to add a retry to the neuron info query:

    The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 504 Gateway Timeout, content type "text/html", content: <html>

-------------------------

[quote="SyBer, post:230, topic:2765"]

[/quote]
Well, it has a different status code than the rest of the neurons, I only based it on my observation, since I cannot fully dissolve any other neurons yet to confirm that's what it means, and I didn't find documentation. It's possible that the 1st neuron comes pre-dissolved, but I don't know.

[quote="SyBer, post:231, topic:2765"]

[/quote]
Yeah, true. I didn't get a timeout, but yeah for sure. Did this error stop the script or did it keep going to the next neuron?

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-13 20:04:30 UTC | #233

It keeps going normally including creating the output file.

On another hand, I indeed have some weird things going with my dissolve times:
|Dissolve delay: 0 seconds|
|Dissolve delay: 58 days, 9 hours, 44 minutes, 38 seconds|
|Dissolve delay: 73 days, 2 hours, 53 minutes, 5 seconds|
|Dissolve delay: 118 days, 1 hours, 32 minutes, 3 seconds|

The guide says:
`the other dissolve delays may have a small random number of days either added or removed.`

Is a random amount of days for a whole month really possible?

-------------------------

[quote="SyBer, post:233, topic:2765"]

[/quote]

As far as me and a friend were able to see, it seems the delays are randomized. My 2nd neuron also has a delay of about 50 days. Or the data from the API is wrong, but the conversion to days is not wrong. To be honest I feel they might have made it a +/- random number and then possibly had problems that the 2nd neuron had a too small delay, so maybe we all have the 2nd neuron at minimum 30 days. I've only seen 50+ days for now. And yeah the "small number of days" seems to mean anywhere up to a few weeks, even a month. Another stupid thing they did for us, to be honest.
My last neuron is also over 4 years, I think even more than yours.

Where did the initial market liquidity come from? KYC wasn’t available until launch, it had errors, and takes 24-48 hours after KYC to be released. Seems fishy. Either some folks didn’t go thru KYC or had priority access.

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-13 22:42:44 UTC | #236

I'm currently in the process of taking control of my neurons. I've managed to successfully derive a native Internet Computer principal from my Ethereum seed and passed KYC. I've also downloaded and installed `didc` , the Candid compiler, download and extract the NNS canister interfaces, and created an empty `dfx.json` file in my current directory, however I'm running into an issue when trying to connect to the Internet Computer using the command **dfx ping https://ic0.app** -- I receive an error message **Cannot read identity file at '/Users/ABC123/.config/dfx/identity/ABC123/identity.pem': A key was rejected by Ring: InvalidEncoding**

Note: **ABC123** used to redact personal details

Has anyone else experienced this issue or does know what I'm doing wrong? Any help would really be appreciated!

[/quote]

What only makes sense to me is it would have to be the Team and the VC investors from the private presale round in 2018. And I totally agree with what you're probably thinking - wasn't fair and a real dick move from Dfinity. Seeing the price was around $600 at the start, and if a seed investor put in $1000 into the seed round, selling his 2% at $300 instead of $600 is an over $100k loss for him. And that's just on the 2%. Not that the investment didn't pay off, but the way the token launch went was seriously unfair to seed investors, and besides that the communication was really bad, almost non-existant - and basically still is.
All that after waiting for 4 years with little to none updates, promised and cancelled token launches, and then finding out 98% of the tokens we've been waiting for for 4 years are vested up to 4 more years. It's kind of unbelievable. I still think the tech is interesting, but on the other hand it hasn't proved itself yet with any real world use case. Even querying the neurons right now is quite slow, with that speed there is no dream of running websites on this network. It takes several seconds for a read-only operation, on Amazon it's a few milliseconds. We'll see.

Yes, I had my KYC verified almost 48 hours ago and get the same message as you do. I wrote on support, where they told me that "it can take up to 2 business days for KYC to take effect", which doesn't really make any sense because one seed investor I know was able to disburse his neuron immediately after his KYC was verified. On Dfinity support they told me that a dev will reach out to me, but so far no nothing.

Hi Lefteris,
nice to see you here.
I fully agree with your statement. I have an air-gapped device running PureOS. 
Do you have a good advice how to upgrade with the least hassle?
Just upgrading the lib creates more problems/dependencies ... 
How did you do it?

-------------------------

mac | 2021-05-14 15:24:11 UTC | #246

cc @LefterisJP 

My thought on this was that if Dfinity is not providing ability to compile dfx from source (yet), then they should provide precompiled dfx binaries that have been compiled with dependencies bundled in the executable. Something like `dfx-<version>-linux-arm64-portable`. This way users could also use a Tails session (an in-memory only Linux, optional networking turned off that doesn't really have any build tools or package manager) for their security. But yeah the ultimate solution is to allow build from source then users can go any route they need.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/issue-with-dfx-binary-and-airgapped-tails-machine/3083

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2021-05-14 16:09:16 UTC | #247

Hey Christoph! Nice seeing you here too.

So let me tell you. Don't try to upgrade only glibc in a system. It just does not work. And due to the nature of glibc you can't just put the .so in a specific directory and have it picked up only by the `dfx` binary. It just won't work.

So the real solution is to upgrade the entire airgapped machine. But ... that would also mean wiping it. Which would mean migrating all you have there in another machine, making sure backups work ... lots of hassle.

What you can do is get a new airgapped machine, install latest ubuntu LTS (and only very very latest -- even previous LTS won't work with the requirements of the dfx binary) and use that.

Or ... accept less security and do what I did. Keysmith works fine in my airgapped machine. So I generated the identity.pem file there. I encrypted it with a password and then moved the encrypted file to my networked machine.

There I have scripts which emulate air-gapping. They kill the network (you can also just pull the LAN cable), prompt me to decrypt the identity file, import it in dfx, do the `dfx sign` command, get the `message.json` output and then delete the decrypted identify file both from the place where I decrypted it and where it was imported (`~/.config/dfx/identity` in linux) and finally bring the network back online.

Doesn't protect from a malware that the networked machine would be already infected with but well it's a "safe enough" approach for me I guess.

I hope to move to a more secure setup as soon as it's available.

Plus this key has already been in a networked computer and a chrome extension during the seed sale, so it's already kind of compromised. Need to switch to a new key as soon as I understand how it all works.

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-14 16:16:55 UTC | #248

@LefterisJP for just a little bit more security, you could use a virtual on-screen keyboard to input the password on that machine. That gets around any possible keylogger. It's very impractical (understatement) for a virus to be taking screen video recording the whole time, unless someone was specifically after you :slight_smile: But keyloggers are much more common.
EDIT: actually nevermind, probably most keyloggers will catch input from a virtual keyboard just the same.

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-05-14 16:41:20 UTC | #249

Appreciate your insight. This was the only method that worked for me. Virtual machines on Mac OS running latest Ubuntu. I imagine Windows users had to do the same.

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-05-14 16:42:48 UTC | #250

Or use an app like ReiKey to alert the user to keyboard logging.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-14 17:09:08 UTC | #251

Thanks for the clue! I looked through `governance.proto` as well as `governance.rs`.

I found reference to these two methods

`pub fn get_neuron_info(&self, now_seconds: u64) -> NeuronInfo {`
`pub fn stake_e8s(&self) -> u64`

We know that `get_neuron_info` method works, but `stake_e8s` does not appear to be exposed?

`dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER stake_e8s "($NEURON_ID:nat64)" --output=raw`

`The Replica returned an error: code 3, message: "ICO302: Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai has no update method 'stake_e8s'`

`dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER stake_e8s "($NEURON_ID:nat64)" --output=raw --query`

`The Replica returned an error: code 3, message: "ICO302: Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai has no query method 'stake_e8s'`

This is still fundamentally strange. How is a user supposed to verify what is staked in their neuron? And then of course, I couldn't find anything about understanding what reward balances are or how much rewards can be spawned out of a neuron without touching the amount of stake locked behind the dissolve delay.

-------------------------

CJentzsch | 2021-05-14 18:51:23 UTC | #252

Thanks a lot.
I created a bootable USB stick with the latest Ubuntu with my air-gapped machine. Worked great.

LefterisJP | 2021-05-14 19:03:35 UTC | #253

Aha so you just do it all in a live USB with latest ubuntu but from the airgapped machine. Yeah that would also work! Great :slight_smile:

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-17 01:48:55 UTC | #262

Not having much success. I'm thinking I might just wait for the Ledger hardware wallet support if I can confirm that's it's going to be compatible and coming in the near future. 

@ililic are you able to confirm whether the pending ledger hardware wallet support will also be compatible with seed round donor and early contributor 12 word mnemonics?

-------------------------

ililic | 2021-05-17 01:52:16 UTC | #263

I believe so - Keysmith uses [BIP39](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith/blob/master/go.mod) wordlist which is compatible with [Ledger](https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background/master_seed.html) wordlist and is a pretty robust industry standard at this point.

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-17 01:58:49 UTC | #264

Ok great, thanks for the reply. I think I might just wait for hw support then and hope it works. I know it's probably a "how long is a piece of string" question, but if you had to guesstimate, do you think ledger support will be released in a matter of weeks or months?

-------------------------

ililic | 2021-05-17 02:02:20 UTC | #265

Hard to give an estimate because security reviews are dependent on external parties as well as approval processes by the hardware vendors themselves, but it is work that has been ongoing for some time and is a high priority for the team.

-------------------------

nmp | 2021-05-17 10:47:13 UTC | #266

I am using an air gapped approach and all steps have worked for me so far.

However when I disburse a neuron, nothing actually seems to happen. I just get a successful Request ID: 0xac1a33350c69291cffc25ad92959b933a27fb40f4f3849f6ff1fe9e9b1268d19

When I later check on the neuron, it is still in state dissolved but no ICP have been disbursed.

    (
      variant {
    Ok = record {
      dissolve_delay_seconds = 0 : nat64;
      recent_ballots = vec {};
      created_timestamp_seconds = 1_621_187_677 : nat64;
      state = 3 : int32;
      retrieved_at_timestamp_seconds = 1_621_247_750 : nat64;
      voting_power = 2_085_953_945_951 : nat64;
      age_seconds = 48_257_688 : nat64;
    }
      },
    )

I have tried disbursing 4 times over the span of a few days. Is there any way I can use the REQUEST_ID to find out what is failing? It does not seem to be KYC since I received an email saying I was verified on the 12th May.

-------------------------

nmp | 2021-05-17 13:19:16 UTC | #267

Shouldn't age be reset to 0 when state = 3 (dissolved)?

-------------------------

Cielo | 2021-05-17 14:39:03 UTC | #268

Check your balance? I don't recall the neuron details changing even after successful disbursal.

dfx ledger --network ic balance

-------------------------

Cielo | 2021-05-17 14:43:22 UTC | #269

I noticed it didn't after disbursal. My assumption is that it doesn't matter. If you did manage to put back in any ICP, the time weighted rebalancing recalculation would rebalance age to 0 I think.

The first neuron is dissolved. You can disburse that one. The rest have dissolve delays that increase in 30 day increments. Neurons cannot earn voting rewards unless their dissolve delay is at least six months. 

I think that's correct.

According to these links they all already pre-aged and participate in voting:

> We are pleased to inform you that your neurons have been pre-aged! At the moment of Genesis Unlock, their age was already set to 18 months old. This is important, because neuron age significantly increases your voting power and the voting rewards you receive.

Yet you have a point that this actually says othewise:

> A neuron cannot vote (or earn rewards for voting) when its dissolve delay falls below six months. Once the dissolve delay reaches zero, it stops falling and the controlling principal can instruct the neuron to disburse.

Will be great to hear a clarification from a team member about this matter.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-18 20:28:55 UTC | #279

As far as I can tell, they are all pre-aged to give them a bonus in the form of increased voting power. So if you wanted to you can increase the dissolve delays to above six months and then those neurons could vote and make use of the bonus.

yeah finally managed to crack it now :partying_face: 

thanks for the help everyone!

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-19 14:51:59 UTC | #283

So basically all our neurons will stop getting rewards the moment their dissolve delay drops sub 6 months?

So it seems we either have to call stop_dissolving method on them all or be ready for 6 months without rewards while they dissolve to 0, correct?

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-19 15:23:38 UTC | #284

They are in locked mode by default and dissolve delays stay constant. Did you put your neurons all into dissolving mode? If you did then yes when they drop below six months dissolve delay then they stop earning rewards / 'maturing'.

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-19 17:01:48 UTC | #285

Good catch, I assumed they already in dissolving mode, so this all makes sense now :+1:.

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-20 10:48:59 UTC | #286

Does anyone know the proper way to call the increase_dissolve_delay with dfx?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-20 13:39:21 UTC | #287

The function you need to call is `manage_neuron`, check the did [here](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-ifaces/blob/master/governance.did)

```bash
dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet sign \
rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron \
'(record { id = opt record { id = <NEURON_ID>:nat64 }; command = opt variant { Configure = record { operation = opt variant { IncreaseDissolveDelay = record { additional_dissolve_delay_seconds = <DISSOLVE_DELAY_IN_SECONDS>:nat32 } } } } })'

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-20 18:36:33 UTC | #288

I understand the "Internet Identity" approach to authentication for logging into Dapps on the IC. You can register multiple supported devices, as well as security keys. You can even use ledger nanos that support FIDO U2F for an added layer of security and recovery (destroys FIDO security key after three failed PIN attempts, and can restore the FIDO security key with the BIP39 seed.). This is all really amazing. 

What I don't understand is how is this supposed to work for users who have a private/public key pair? Can seed rounders access the nns app or not? Can someone please point me to how existing private/public key pairs are supposed to interact with the IC, especially in an airgapped or hardware wallet setup? It feels like two totally incompatible authentication frameworks... what am I missing?

Many thanks.

-------------------------

SyBer | 2021-05-21 12:17:35 UTC | #289

For a good measure, they should allow moving all the neurons to new seeds including those generated by the hardware wallet.

Keeping the same seed for 4 years of manual entry operations is an unreasonable expectation.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-21 15:18:21 UTC | #290

Can someone please confirm: can users with seeds or public/private key pairs use the NNS dapp or not? Am I the only one who does not understand this?

Thanks.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-22 07:49:25 UTC | #291

You currently can't. You can create an Internet Identity to add as a Hot Key to your Neurons to make managing them a bit easier though.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-22 17:26:36 UTC | #292

Thanks for the sanity check. I'm guessing this will start working once hardware wallet support is released.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-05-23 20:56:46 UTC | #293

Does this update bring the ability use the NNS dapp with seed neurons? 

Can you expand on the comment about creating an internet identity to use as a hot key to your neurons ? @cryptoschindler

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-23 22:05:48 UTC | #294

You should be able to use this to add hot keys
```bash
# Add Hot Key

dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet sign \
rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron \
'(record { id = record { id = <NEURON_ID> : nat64}; command = variant { Configure = record { operation = variant { AddHotKey = record {new_hot_key = principal <PRINCIPAL_OF_NEW_HOT_KEY>}}}}})'
```

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-05-24 22:22:29 UTC | #295

Is a hotkey basically just another account that controls the neuron? So after the command above, both the original principal and the new principal would fully control the neuron?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-24 22:32:08 UTC | #296

No, not fully.

> The following actions can be initiated using the principal or a hot key that has been configured:

* <strong>Vote</strong>
Have the neuron vote to either adopt or reject a proposal with a specified ID.
* <strong>Follow</strong>
Add a rule that enables the neuron to vote automatically on proposals that belong to a specific topic, by specifying a group of followee neurons whose majority vote is followed. The configuration of such follow rules can be used to: a) distribute control over voting power amongst multiple entities, b) have a neuron vote automatically when its owner lacks time to evaluate newly submitted proposals, c) have a neuron vote automatically when its own lacks the expertise to evaluate newly submitted proposals, and d) for other purposes. A follow rule specifies a set of followees. Once a majority of the followees votes to adopt or reject a proposal belonging to the specified topic, the neuron votes the same way. If it becomes impossible for a majority of the followees to adopt (for example, because they are split 50–50 between adopt and reject), then the neuron votes to reject. If a rule is specified where the proposal topic is null, then it becomes a catch-all follow rule, which will be used to vote automatically on proposals belonging to topics for which no specific rule has been specified. If the list of followees is empty, this effectively removes a follow rule.

I am an investor in the pre-sale round. I provided theprincipal id and completed the KYC.
Which is my wallet address?
How can I check my balance?
How to send tokens?
How to import to nns.app?

oldseed | 2021-05-25 13:01:06 UTC | #298

It's very difficult.

How did you do the principal id and kyc?

I haven't done anything yet. Still just have my 12 words. I'm just going to wait for hardware wallet support and hopefully not be diluted away in the meantime.

Can anyone from Dfinity provide transparency on a rough estimate for when a solution addressing seed neurons will be released? Are we talking days weeks or months? @sillytuna

-------------------------

BeckyLU | 2021-05-26 12:47:20 UTC | #302

There's no yet official announcements / docs for presale round investors.
The instructions is just for seed round participants (2017).
https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html

-------------------------

BeckyLU | 2021-05-26 12:55:00 UTC | #303

There's no hotkey controls the neurons, your neurons are under control of Genesis Token Canister.

So your public key derived from original 12 words, can claim the control of neurons.

Claude1 | 2021-05-26 13:20:34 UTC | #304

Has anyone figured out any of the following using dfx in an airgapped setup?

1. How can one see if a neuron has `kyc_verified=true` ?
2. How can one see what the maturity of a neuron is?
3. How can one see how many ICP tokens are locked in a neuron?

None of these seem to be available in `get_neuron_info`

Are there any updates on ETA for hardware wallet support / "self custody" from Dfinity foundation? I'd like to be able to use nns.ic0.app to manage neurons but can't do so currently, so stuck in a complicated undocumented scenario.

I've noticed that only my neurons with a dissolve delay of greater than around 6 months are voting. Does this mean neurons with a dissolve delay of less than 6 months are not receiving rewards?

-------------------------

nerdoutcj | 2021-05-28 01:29:21 UTC | #307

That is correct. Dessolve delay has to be grater than six months.

Are there any instructions for how to transfer ICP to different address after they've been dissolved and disbursed from a neuron? Can you type the example command for doing this? 

How do you view how many ICP are in a neuron? Can you type the example command for checking this? 

How do I query my total voting power for a neuron and for my identity? After taking into account various age and locking bonus? 

How do you check the amount of ICP in your identity address? Can you type the example command for this? 

After you start disolving a neuron, how do you view how much time is left until it's fully dissolved? Can you type the example command for this? 

How do you spawn new neurons from a neuron that has already reached maturity ? Can you type the example command for this? 

How do you check the maturity level to see if the new neurons can be spawned? Can you type the example command for this? 

After spawning a new neuron, how do you find out the newly spawned neurons Id and unstake it, disolve it, and transfer ICP to a different address? Can you type the example command for this? 

When a neuron reaches maturity and can spawn a new neuron, if it doesn't have the spawn function called does it continue to accumulate ICP indefinitely? Or do you need to call the spawn function in order for a neuron to continue earning ICP after a certain threshold of 100% maturity is reached? 

How long does a neuron take to reach maturity threshold of 10% such that a new neuron can be spawned?  

Does the amount of ICP in a neuron effect how long it takes to reach maturity? 

Is there a maximum maturity cap? When it reaches a certain level does the neuron no longer accumulate rewards? Is this max maturity cap equal to a spawned neuron with 100% of the ICP locked in the parent neuron? 

How long would it take for a neuron to reach 100% maturity? 

Is there any benefit to having a neuron accumulate maturity vs spawning a neuron as soon as the threshold of 10% is crossed? 

What is the benefit of having a neuron with higher maturity, after the 10% neuron spawn threshold has been crossed? And does a neuron stop accumulating rewards once its maturity is 100% ? 

Are there any penalties for calling spawn function on a neuron? After spawn is called, Does the maturity of the neuron reset to 0? What effect does that have on the neuron when it has a higher/lower maturity in terms of the ICP it earns? Does the maturity level have a Max cap ? Once that is reached can it no longer increase the amount of ICP in tbe spawned neuron? 

How do you find out what reward balances are or how much rewards can be spawned out of a neuron without touching the amount of stake locked behind the dissolve delay? Can you type the example command for checking this? 

How do you check a neurons maturity? Can you type the example command for this? 

Can you confirm whether or not the first neuron (with 0 dissolve delay) is by default unlocked and/or disolved or whether it is staked by default and earning rewards?

Can you confirm whether or not the first six seed neurons with disolve delays less than six months earn any rewards ? Since they have been pre aged to 18 months but have a disolve delay less than six months. Are they allowed to vote while they remain staked and do they accumulate any rewards?  

How do you increase the disolve delay of seed neurons that haven't started disolving. For example, those neurons with a disolve delay of less than six months. How do you increase their disolve delays to greater than six months? Once this action is completed will they be able to vote? Can you type the example command for doing this? 

How do you configure who a seed neuron is following? And change, update, and edit this value? Can you type the example command for doing this? 

By default are any seed neurons set to disolve? Or are they staked and not in disolve mode? If they are staked do the six neurons with less the six month disolve delays earn any rewards? 

How do you check the disolve delay? Can you type the example command for this? 

How do you check the vote history of a neuron? How do you check how many proposals a neuron has voted on ? How do you check who a neuron is following? Can you type the example command for this? 

Are seed neurons following anyone by default? Can you type the example command for checking who a neuron is following?

Can anyone from Dfinity provide transparency on a rough estimate for when we be able to link to the seed neurons to web app and manage the neurons from the GUI interface instead of the command line ? (we talking days weeks or months? Or at the very least a date when we can expect an answer about this?)

All the process for seed round is frustrated, I just can help to answer few questions I figured out. We may need more patience for the team to provide a GUI interface for all investors including seed round and pre-sale.

Are there any instructions for how to transfer ICP to different address after they’ve been dissolved and disbursed from a neuron? Can you type the example command for doing this?
Check commands here: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/self-custody-quickstart.html

How do you view how many ICP are in a neuron? Can you type the example command for checking this?
It seems ICP are evenly divided among 49 neurons.

How do I query my total voting power for a neuron and for my identity? After taking into account various age and locking bonus?
NEURON_ID=...
CANISTER=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
RESULT="$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_neuron_info "($NEURON_ID:nat64)" --output=raw)"

Check the seed round instruction: [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html](https://dfinity.org/seed/)
At the end of part "Take control of your neurons"

How do you check the amount of ICP in your identity address? Can you type the example command for this?
dfx ledger --network ic balance

After you start disolving a neuron, how do you view how much time is left until it’s fully dissolved? Can you type the example command for this?
Use the above command to check the neuron info. When the "dissolve_delay_seconds = 0", it's ready to disburse.

There's no further doc for checking maturity and spawn neuron.
