4 years ago (Feb 2017) I participated in the seed round. 

I had 12 words to access my ICP. I haven't seen any further details or instructions about how us early participants will be able to access our ICP on Genesis.

Please share.

Thank you.

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-07 21:22:37 UTC | #2

Same. 

Further details would be appreciated. I am keen to contribute towards network governance from day 0 but have not received any information regarding token retrieval. Please can someone from the Dfinity Foundation provide further instruction ASAP?

-------------------------

b9586 | 2021-05-07 21:45:29 UTC | #3

I would also appreciate an answer to the same question!

-------------------------

ie247 | 2021-05-07 23:22:17 UTC | #4

I also participated in the Seed fundraise in Feb 2017.

Where can we find instructions to access our ICP tokens? Looking forward to participate in governance and using the network.

We are in the same boat, brothers.

robypsi | 2021-05-08 02:43:36 UTC | #6

Documentation released yesterday indicated seed allocations will be locked pending KYC. But with launch days away, and no information about KYC process, will seed participants even be able to access their ICP upon launch?

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-08 03:17:50 UTC | #7

Is there something specific that mentions seed allocations or are you talking about the NNS documentation that states “When new neurons are created at Genesis, they have GenesisKYC=false. This restricts what actions they can perform. Specifically, they cannot spawn new neurons, and once their dissolve delays are zero, they cannot be disbursed and their balances unlocked to new accounts"? 

Dfinity Foundation, can we please have some information regarding the KYC process for seed round participants?

-------------------------

tavroh | 2021-05-09 21:20:58 UTC | #8

Come on Dfinity, you had almost 4.5 years to ask seed investors to do KYC. Are you really going to launch first and only then start asking them for information and start providing documentation for those who financed and enabled you in the first place? Seems quite dishonest actually.

-------------------------

xETHeREALx | 2021-05-09 22:07:31 UTC | #9

I was told more info would be made available tomorrow for the seed rounders. Not great if they allowed all other groups to KYC pre-launch, but then spring this on us post-launch. If this was going to be required, it could have been sorted a long time ago.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2021-05-09 22:22:01 UTC | #10

I'm still not sure how seed rounders would go through KYC.

All we have is 12 words.

I'm not particularly interested in sharing my 12 words over the internet to CoinList to gain access to my ICP. 

I'm not sure how they intend to make this work.

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-09 22:36:06 UTC | #11

I was hoping there would be hardware wallet support as I'm really not keen on entering my seed anywhere online, or handing it over to any trusted third party. But from the NNS documentation it seems that all neuron balances will be locked pending KYC approval.

Is it possible for the team to create an interface so that users without a technical profile can claim the seed tokens without problems, please? I don't like to play commandos when money is involved.

(And for those of us who are not Linux and Mac users). Thanks.

Hi! I follow the steps for claim seed participans, but in the KYC proccess I have an error, when I try to submit my info and documments appears an error "Invalid Principal ID", I try a lot of format, with passport, National ID card, Driver liscense, all, but always the same error...

is it happening to you? 

Thanks!

Yup there's going to be a lot of seed people that are unable to access until a better interface is out.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-10 15:32:39 UTC | #18

the EOF error is resolved by using
`echo {} > dfx.json` instead of `echo > dfx.json` 

the not a directory is resolved by this

> Separate the two sudo instructions across two lines. They pasted that in and it lose the line break.

(thanks alex sillytuna)

so you would need to run 
```
sudo install -d /usr/local/bin
sudo install keysmith /usr/local/bin
```

https://dfinity.org/seed has been updated with the correct steps!

The KYC page seems to be struggling, any likely resolution.  It throws tons of 400 and 502 errors on the websocket polling.  I can't seem to get it to register the face photo at all, and at times when trying to access the page it throws a 502 error. The first time I visited it early this morning, I did get the photo uploads to work but when I submitted it had a database error saying the user id was missing, even though I filled the form completely (looked like a different field from principle id).

-------------------------

joshua | 2021-05-10 15:41:28 UTC | #20

I'm also having the "Invalid Principal ID" issue and I can't finish the KYC. What are we supposed to write in this field? I tried ID card, passport no., driving license ... nothing worked

-------------------------

xETHeREALx | 2021-05-10 15:43:02 UTC | #21

The Principle id is generated by the keysmith you get it from the keysmith with the command in the instructions, the error I got was for a different field FWIW.

-------------------------

xETHeREALx | 2021-05-10 15:47:47 UTC | #22

I got the photo thing working, but this is the error I get, as below this is a database error and is not related to the principle ID which I generated and input:

"sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (psycopg2.errors.NotNullViolation) null value in column "token_holder_id" violates not-null constraint"

-------------------------

Is it likely the foundation will release a UI for seed investors to access tokens rather than completing these steps on command line?

-------------------------

I have the same error with KYC.

Hi folks,

Thanks for reporting the `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError` error. Our internal teams are working on it and we'll let you know when the issue is resolved.

-------------------------

Zaka | 2021-05-10 18:31:41 UTC | #28

They wont. 
They're making it as difficult as possible for seed investors to claim their tokens, so they wont dump the price.
Even if you complete the process you still have most of your tokens locked in neurons.

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-10 18:39:19 UTC | #29

Surely the institutional investors have a nice tool to transfer their ICP...

As much as I think Dfinity is truly a great project, I can't help but feel the seed investors were left forgotten. Even the instructions for us were published about 10 hours before the launch. We need to go through a KYC process in the last moment and don't have access to our tokens until the KYC is resolved. I don't mind the locking/vesting that much, but I'm also not sure that this was communicated at the time of investment. But I don't think it is fair that we don't have a chance to transfer our ICP at the same time as others, be it presale investors or the team itself. We made the project possible in the first place, and that should be reflected. I am excited for the future of Dfinity, but at the same point I am disappointed in the handling of this. After patiently waiting for 4 years, I think we deserved better than this.

I have bought a macbook (never used one before) and managed to install keysmith and the dfinity canister sdk,

As per the instructions I then typed 
read seed
then entered my seed

after hitting return i was just taken to the next line. there was no confirmation that I had entered a seed correctly. Is this normal?

similarly, i then went to the next line typing:
echo $seed | ./keysmith private-key -f - -i 0 -o identity-0.pem

I don't get any confirmation that anything has happened. Again, is this a normal response?

-------------------------

I'm having issues at this same stage. 

After entering "echo $seed | ./keysmith private-key -f - -i 0 -o identity-0.pem" I then entered "dfx identity import < name > identity-0.pem" but it returns "No such file or directory".

Do we just replace < name > with our own name/identity?

It doesn't look like it's a priority. They haven't even fixed the KYC form for seed contributors yet and it's been several hours. For a missing ID field error, which any capable developer could fix in a few minutes.

* Buggy and incomplete docs and a (mandatory) KYC that's not working
* Support is practically non-existent
* No hardware wallet support (well not even ANY wallet)

This. It's embarrassingly bad.I won't even go into all the problems other than say I still can't KYC.

For a project which wants to be so huge, someone actually needs firing for this utter shambles. That and there's a total lack of meaningful community support for anyone. I feel very sorry for the devs here.

Dfinity look really poor right now. 4 years and fluffed the basics. Sorry folks, really disappointed right now.

EDIT: Used Safari and it worked better than Chrome, which failed on two different devices multiple times.

-------------------------

davidhq | 2021-05-10 21:19:51 UTC | #50

We could be mad at developers of the project or maybe we could try to understand what the *actual priorities were*. And that seems to be the actual R&D of breakthrough tech like Chain Key and other critical components. So... maybe let's be patient and I'm also sure they don't exactly love this KYC thing, it's a neccessary evil and maybe they couldn't find people inside their org that agreed to do this dirty job instead of more interesting things ;D

Hi everyone. 
how come Windows isn't supported in the claim process? it's only by far the most popular OS in the world. I mean, people need to go and buy a mac to be able to claim. 

Now that that's out, I need some help. I'm following the instructions to letter (macOs, yes I had to buy two) and when I get to the ``` dfx ping https://ic0.app ``` command I'm getting the following error:
A key was rejected by Ring: InvalidEncoding

I'm unable to proceed further. I've tried this on two different brand new mac machines (not M1).

help would be appreciated

-------------------------

jonas | 2021-05-10 21:25:28 UTC | #52

That's all fine and well, but the KYC forms should've been available days before the launch. Putting additional forced delays onto just a part of contributors is simply unfair and utterly disappointing. If anyone, the seed contributors should've been the first ones to have access, not the other way around. I don't feel that our contributions are being valued. The banks are being valued. This is not the way of crypto.
And it doesn't matter if someone wants to sell or not, after 4 years everyone should have that right to decide by themselves, and we weren't granted that. To sell the measly 2% of our tokens.

Was the invalid character issue ever resolved? I get that on the $RESULT call.

Edit: Also FWIW, I used two very old laptops and just put clean installs of Ubuntu on them, one with networking, one without. I tend to think linux will be easier and much cheaper than buying Macs for this.

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-10 21:33:17 UTC | #54

Never found a solution. I was told it's because of a fundamental format issue if doing offline signing but I can't confirm that. I'm using a mix of linux and mac devices.

Also, just looking through the notes, there's no actual instructions for how to do anything once disbursed. On top of that, it looks like to do anything, or at least some things, after a reboot you need to reput in your passphrase so the command line variables work. 

I could understand if this was a rushed release, and perhaps it was in the end, but neither this nor the airdrop being held in a (not very good) centralised exchange for 12 months is winning any friends. Oh, or the -still- lack of clarity on token releases.

(once again, not putting this on the devs here - this is an organisational issue)

Yup. 

Hi there, thank you for reaching out with this feedback. Unfortunately at the moment many of these systems are highly technical. If you feel you need some help with getting started, we would encourage you to reach out to the Developer Support Forum, where your question may already have been addressed or resolved previously by the community.

-------------------------

xETHeREALx | 2021-05-10 22:02:41 UTC | #61

On the economic side, if this prevents a massive initial dump and makes investors better returns over the long run, I'm fine with it. Our neurons are set to be earning voting rewards automatically, so at least there's that. From re-reading it seems we can only dissolve about 2% right now, I think the 18 months of age doesn't change the dissolve delay. 

I wish there was better support, the process does not seem to have been tested much though given the error we're getting with the response decode.

-------------------------

nile | 2021-05-10 22:04:40 UTC | #62

I'm just going to leave it for now I think. Even if I disperse my tokens from the neuron with a 0 day dissolve delay I'm not sure how to send them anywhere. Hopefully someone will make a nice step-by-step tutorial on YouTube and we'll get a nice official wallet with ui and/or ledger/trezor integration.

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-10 22:05:10 UTC | #63

It's not about being technical, it's about a bug claiming tokens that multiple people experienced and where you get set from one place to another and back again. 

This is not a getting started development question and we were told to contact support by this very forum.

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-10 22:05:55 UTC | #64

I don't have a great issue with the slow dispersal either. What I would like is a lot more clarity across all tokens as I don't think we have that. The tokens being traded right now - where are they from?

-------------------------

davidhq | 2021-05-10 22:09:03 UTC | #65

I think the way to look at this project is outside of the box of what is supposed to be "the way of the crypto"... I guess they think they know what they are doing exactly and for now we are mostly along for the ride.. we haven't actually done anything useful for the project (most of us) so we should be grateful for current situation... even if we cannot yet touch "our coins"... We invested into something and their rules are their rules... some other cryptos had other types of rules after launch.. it was also much more of a wild west at 2014 Ethereum ICO and in some ways even more so in all other half-baked ICOs in 2017... here things are more structured and thought out and over time everything including our tokens will work.

-------------------------

davidhq | 2021-05-10 22:07:53 UTC | #66

It's an interesting mystery for sure, I'd also like someone to answer when they figure it out... maybe even someone from the team if they happen to stumble upon this thread.

-------------------------

xETHeREALx | 2021-05-10 22:09:01 UTC | #67

LOL, the problem isn't that this is too technical, it's that there's a very clear bug.  This a copy/paste thing with the commands given, we get the response as expected, and we can look at it and it's a hex string.  The decoder complains that the x in the 0x header is invalid... come on, don't condescend to us about this being overly technical and us just needing to be better.

-------------------------

xETHeREALx | 2021-05-10 22:11:17 UTC | #68

Well, kinda -- they make the rules, sure. There was definitely terms set out in 2017 for the seed round, they were pretty specific, and this sure isn't anything like what was described back then. They also haven't provided any update on expectations until literally the hours before launch.

-------------------------

> The tokens being traded right now - where are they from?

That's what I'd like to know too. According to Coinmarketcap, $150 million in ICP was traded until now. It isn't from the seed round because we are all still waiting for KYC, and it isn't from the airdrop because Coinlist didn't unlock the tokens for several hours, and now the withdrawals have been disabled for several hours as well.

So who is it then? The team, the banks from presale? It wasn't mentioned in the Genesis event that there will be priority access for privileged individuals.

was probably in the terms of all their VC and private sale deals. Otherwise they wouldn't have accepted the higher price compared to seed

-------------------------

everhusk | 2021-05-10 22:51:42 UTC | #73

Quite the contrary:

1. Your seed investment is worth 10000x, potentially one of the best investments you will ever make in your life.
2. They are deploying fundamentally new software that doesn't work quite easily with existing Web2
3. If you've ever launched a crypto you would realize it's a high pressure situation, and catering to ungrateful seed investors (who are by far the biggest winners right now) makes sense to me IMHO.
4) Then figure out how to build it, this ecosystem and your tokens (which you likely hold a large potion of as a seed investor) will only sustain it's value if you step up and contribute more than complaining to a DECENTRALIZED project to do more work. It's now YOUR responsiblity.

-------------------------

robypsi | 2021-05-10 22:53:23 UTC | #74

Considering individuals from Dfinity were a significant portion of the seed round per Dominic’s own admission, I’m curious if all of the Dfinity team seed round participants were compliant with the seed TOS and not residents OR citizens of USA

-------------------------

Bit_Zen_00 | 2021-05-10 22:53:54 UTC | #75

How long does it take for a team like Dfinity to create a website to be able to claim the seed tokens? Is all this really necessary?

I'm sorry but this statement is very naive. First of all, you are basing that on the current price, which is changing rapidly, second of all, our investment is worth nothing at the moment because we cannot even access our tokens. And lastly, in the short term we can only sell 2% of the tokens, once we can even transfer anything. And for the rest, it's all vested, and you can't make any assumptions what the price will be in a few years. The project might not even exist anymore, could get hacked, people's wallets could get hacked and so on.
Also demanding gratitude from investors because they made money is just incredibly arrogant. If we didn't back this project, it would never come to fruition.
We are not entitled to gains, but we are entitled to some respect.

If you tried to supply `--output` as a PATTERN use `-- --output`

USAGE:

dfx canister send <file-name>

For more information try --help

**error:** Found argument 'decode' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

USAGE:

didc [FLAGS] <SUBCOMMAND>

For more information try --help

1) Has anyone got offline (air gapped) signing to work yet?

2) Has anyone got through KYC? Not heard a bean since I managed to get the form to submit.

Yes, it was 18. Upgraded to 20 and all is good. Thank you!

I'm also curious if any seed person has accessed any of their tokens

Replying here but this really should be explained to *everyone* although I'm not sure how I should go about doing that. If you use windows you **DO NOT** need to buy a mac. You can install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) which will give you access to a linux environment alongside your windows install, it may require some technical know-how. Should you run into issues, you can always run linux off a bootable USB.

FYI I made a withdrawal from Coinlist over 2 hours ago, it's still pending, and 10 minutes ago, withdrawals were disabled again. What a joke!

Hi guys, I am one of the presale investors and I have almost know idea what to do after submitting the KYC. I have created my principal identifier and submitted. Yet I received no token nor I have any how to transfer token with the principal identifier I created from Keysmith.

After submitting KYC (without received any confirmation), if I try to disburse I get a "Neuron XXXXX is not kyc verified.". This was expected, question is how long KYC should take and if we are going to receive a confirmation.

Furthermore, once neuron is dissolved and ICP disbursed, how do we interact with them? How do we transfer them? The document with instructions for seed participants ends there ... I see the NNS App is live, but how to use it with our current ICPs? (the app creates a new identity). Thanks!

May I know if there is any success page after your pressed the submit button? I submitted the KYC with my principal identifier, but the page showed NOTHING and my address has 0 ICP.

Their email said there will be an email if my KYC was failed, but I don't even know if my information has been uploaded or not.

Cheers

Hello, lame window user here.

I've installed virtual box - Ubunto

-Keysmith installation OK!
-Dfinity Canister SDK installation OK!
-read seed ---?

I'm stuck at this step... I think I'm missing some command.

What should I write in the terminal?

Big thanks!

type your 12 words seed

-------------------------

snoopyfan | 2021-05-11 09:31:08 UTC | #89

I've open the terminal.
I write "read seed my 12 word seed"
but nothing happens  :(

HackFisher | 2021-05-11 09:31:31 UTC | #90

1. Has anyone passed KYC?
2. How long will the KYC process take?
3. Will it send email on success/failure?

-------------------------

uney | 2021-05-11 09:31:43 UTC | #91

its already done, move to next step

-------------------------

snoopyfan | 2021-05-11 09:40:08 UTC | #92

Thanks for your help uney!

Unfortunately after doing the seed step when I paste

echo $seed | ./keysmith private-key -f - -i 0 -o identity-0.pem

Appears this error meesage 

"bash. /keysmith: The folder or file doesn't exist"

haha I think you didn't added keysmith to bash, remove "./" in front of keysmith

I agree with this. Complainers should be calmed down because they are not good for the project itself, other investors in long term future and also probably not very good for themselves either. Less complaining, more thinking and helping.

I'm getting this error in the claim process. Can someone point me in the right direction?

How do you get the "user number" to register an existing identity on a new device?

I have the identity created in the terminal sdk. But want to connect it to the GUI NNS app

How do I link the terminal identity with the identity.ic0.app GUI so i can view through GUI instead of terminal

-------------------------

claire | 2021-05-11 12:33:40 UTC | #98

Same Question. Anyone succeed?

-------------------------

oldseed | 2021-05-11 13:12:34 UTC | #101

If we just let it sit there are we earning yield?

I don't want to sell, but I hope that my neurons/icp/dfn is at least being put to use right now and earning more.

Anyone know how this works?

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-05-11 13:14:04 UTC | #102

No because it's not voting on proposals

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-11 14:17:24 UTC | #103

Couple of answers:

- Neurons are set to follow the foundation so are voting. Votes happen all the time so it's the only realistic option in most cases.

- The terminal identity and GUI NNS are incompatible, at least for seed holders AFAIK.
