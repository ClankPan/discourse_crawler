Actually so far there has been not a single no vote. https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/28756 meaning that it is highly likely that you will have a ton of time to claim your seed neuron.

Correction: not a single no vote but 715 voting power against the proposal and about 42,5M voting power in favour so I think my original point still stands

-------------------------

seeround_donor | 2021-11-08 21:35:17 UTC | #414

What you think by "ton of time". There is just 15hours left...

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-11-08 21:44:12 UTC | #415

I think you misunderstand the proposal. This proposal doesn't mean you can't claim your seed neuron anymore when you have your seed phrase.

> If I understand correctly, someone will be able to claim my neurons if dfinity foundation do believe them‚Ä¶

It is the exact opposite of this. The DFINITY foundation won't be able to claim your neuron anymore when this proposal passes which at this point seems very likely.

-------------------------

seeround_donor | 2021-11-08 21:48:00 UTC | #416

They will be able to give my unclaimed neurons to someone without seed...

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-11-08 21:54:27 UTC | #417

This is the proposal text:

> Seed allotments that were unclaimed after 6 months were going to be swept to a foundation-controlled neuron, which would allow the foundation to arbitrate claims by those who say they lost their keys, and forward them on appropriately. Owing to difficulties it has encountered, the foundation realizes it cannot play this role.
> 
> This proposal removes the sweep mechanism, except for four participants that have already been successfully processed by the foundation. In the future, an NNS update could make it possible for the NNS, which runs under the control of the decentralized community, to perform this role itself.

Meaning that this proposal **removes** the ability of the foundation to do that.

-------------------------

seeround_donor | 2021-11-08 22:11:32 UTC | #418

I think that you don't understand what I'm saying.

Can someone from the team answer the questions I asked above? 
I believe the dfinity foundation that I will be able to still claim my neurons with my seed

If you all don't want your seed round neurons or have decided to abandon them for some kind of strange protest, ICDevs would be happy to take them off your hands and lock them in for 8 years.

Hi there üëã

Michael from DFINITY here.

*‚ÄúSo, basically I have now 16 hours to find how to claim??‚Äù*

No‚Ä¶ your seed phrase will still be valid even if the proposal passes. If ideal [for you], you can still wait to claim your voting neurons/governance tokens.

*‚ÄúCan someone confirm that when I hold valid seed round I will be able to claim my neurons? and also will these neurons continue to earn?‚Äù*

Yes‚Ä¶ you will still be able to use your seed phrase to access your seed round neurons, which will continue to generate governance rewards.

Hope that helps ü§ò

-------------------------

amircryptola | 2021-11-09 04:28:18 UTC | #423

I also got the memo that we only have limited time before seed participant neurons are swept. I don't have many tokens which is why I waited to claim (was waiting for less technical instructions), but now I'm going through the process and am stuck on one part. 

In order to access the KYC form, you need to input a "DFN Address" (aka my "legacy address"). This I did successfully. Now that I'm on the KYC form, it asks for two additional addresses: 1) "Enter your ICP Address" and 2) "Enter your Principal ID". I know my Principal ID, but what does the ICP Address field refer to? Am I meant to re-input my DFN Address in this field or something else?

Thanks!

PS - while going through the process I noticed the link on the seed participant instructions page to NNS canister interfaces no longer works, which seems like a crucial step before claiming.

philipy | 2021-11-09 04:45:56 UTC | #424

[/quote]

I can answer on the technical side (Ledger Nano) since I am involved here. 

I posted an update on Ledger Nano a few days ago on the relevant thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/soft-launch-improved-ic-staking-documentation-and-experience/7623/19?u=diegop

TLDR:
* Ledger Nano team is still reviewing the integration so not available for consumer-facing version
* the ICP integration is available on Ledger Nano's developer mode (and has been for 4-6 weeks)
* I have not updated docs to reflect this because I want to make sure Leder promotes it to consumer mode.
* I post weekly updates on the staking thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/soft-launch-improved-ic-staking-documentation-and-experience/7623/19

-------------------------

timo | 2021-11-09 09:11:53 UTC | #429

No, the KYC process is independent from claiming.

At genesis, neurons were pre-created and configured to earn but had their controller set to the GTC. This was because the real owner's principal could not be known in advance. Claiming essentially means you tell the GTC your principal so that controllership can be moved over from the GTC to your principal. KYC isn't required to do that and, conversely, doing KYC doesn't do the claiming for you.
(GTC = genesis token canister)

Would appreciate if someone can help answer this for me!

On the KYC form itself, it asks for an "ICP Address" in addition to "Principal ID". What does "ICP Address" refer to? Is that my Account ID? Or is that my Legacy DFN Address?

I'm still surprised at how confused all these terms are.

Hello everybody,

I tried to increase the dissolve delay with below commands thru the terminal :

dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet sign \
rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron \
'(record { id = opt record { id = <NEURON_ID>:nat64 }; command = opt variant { Configure = record { operation = opt variant { IncreaseDissolveDelay = record { additional_dissolve_delay_seconds = <DISSOLVE_DELAY_IN_SECONDS>:nat32 } } } } })'

And I get this reply :

Update message generated at [message.json]
Signed request_status append to update message in [message.json]

I don't see the increase of the dissolve delay of the neuron i tried to change the dissolve delay.

Is it ok and takes time or I am missing something? I tried to do increase delay for another neuron too after doing the first and the reply was "message.json already exist".

thank you!!

-------------------------

Ori | 2021-11-19 15:29:06 UTC | #441

That command alone only signs a message which you later have to send. You could do this using `dfx canister --network ic send message.json` from a networked machine.

This is intended for airgapped setups, you sign on the airgapped machine and send from a networked machine.

(The ‚Äúmessage.json already exists‚Äù error is to prevent you overwriting a message which you may not have sent yet.)

There is by now a better tool to use for this than `dfx`. It is `quill` from here: https://github.com/dfinity/quill

But it would be helpful to know first if you are in an air-gapped setup or not. Then we can give you the best instructions.

With quill in the networked setup you have to do this:

`quill --pem-file <path-to-pem-file> neuron-manage -a <seconds> <neuron_id> | quill send -`

You can install quill from a binary release for MacOS (Intel), Linux and arm32 (RPi). Otherwise you have to compile it.

Since you are currently trying dfx you must have already have the .pem file. It must be in
  `~/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem`
or replace default by the name of the identity that you are currently using in dfx. You can substitute that path into the quill command line.

quill will ask you for confirmation to send (y/N) and then send it. Please try with small number of seconds first.

An update on the Ledger Nano integration. The support for seed round access will come in two phases.

Phase 1 (the initial release): The initial release is targeted at all consumers. It allows to manage neurons such as changing dissolve delay, dissolving, disbursing, managing hotkeys, voting, etc. Of course, it also allows to transfer ICP in the ledger.

Phase 2 (the next release after): This next release includes the claim_neurons function for seed round neurons. It is an upgrade specifically for seed round folks.

For the audience in this thread this means: If you already claimed your neurons then, right away with the initial release, you can fully control and manage your neurons directly from the Ledger Nano. You can do so either with the in-browser NNS dapp or with a command-line tool called `ic-hardware-wallet-cli`. The Ledger Nano can connect to both.

If you have not claimed your neurons yet then you can do a one-time step on a (hopefully air-gapped) computer in order to claim and then do all the rest from Ledger Nano. New instructions for the claiming step will be posted (they are easier now with `quill` than they were with `dfx`).  If you don't want to do these steps then you have to wait for the next release after the initial release.

Coding for the next release in under way. This is a relatively simple function to add and the release is expected to come out in weeks (not months).

Tons of Ledger wallets are in 'experimental mode' and work fine. I used Cosmos in experimental mode on Ledger for a year. It's fine. I'd happily use ICP in experimental mode as well, just need instructions on how to do it to retrieve seed balance.

I notice the current file size for the Internet Computer wallet is 88kb which fits fine on Nano S. Should work just as well on the Nano X too.

Good question. Let me ask team.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-03 17:56:56 UTC | #470

Merge maturity support will not be present in this version of the Ledger App.

"Auto" merging of maturity is not supported by the Governance canister yet at all, and so also will not be part of the Ledger app.

Properly supporting auto-merge will likely require some deeper changes to the Ledger canister, notably batch transaction so that we can avoid generating thousands of separate Ledger calls every day when rewards are distributed. Once the governance canister can distribute these rewards in a single call to the Ledger, it will become feasible for neurons to opt-in to auto-merge. But I would not expect this functionality to become available until next year.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-03 18:14:17 UTC | #471

My apologies! I forgot that ‚Äúauto-merge‚Äù was different from the existing merge maturity function. In my mind I was thinking ‚Äúauto‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt have to spawn, dissolve, disburse, and re-stake üòÖ.

Thank you for explaining!

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-03 18:14:27 UTC | #472

Yes, it is semi-auto! :slight_smile:

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-03 18:58:22 UTC | #473

Thanks! Is proposal submission by a neuron in scope in the foreseeable future?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-03 18:59:32 UTC | #474

Can you explain a bit more how you're envisioning that feature to work?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-03 19:17:57 UTC | #475

I am coming to the conclusion that it is possible to "manage" a nnsdapp created neuron (aka NCN) that made use of internet identity through a seed phrase created neuron (aka SPN) (writeup to follow). The management is broadly defined as spawning, maturity merging, dissolving etc.

The SPN would need to submit a proposal to the NCN to accommodate that management. I can do this today with dfx. 

If we were to have such functionality integrated (submit proposal) into the ledger, then it would solve a thorny issue for several folks (@Roman , @LightningLad91 etc ) who need to risk mitigate the use of Internet Identity for managing their store of value through different means.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-03 19:19:58 UTC | #476

And that SPN could be seen by NNSDAPP; but through ledger.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-12-03 20:02:38 UTC | #477

@mparikh, this is what one calls genius. You are just incredible mate. Sorry for my English, maybe I don‚Äôt understand, but Is what you say  about use the new ledger integration ? 

As you know, when I was asking to @ismaelhaider if I will be able to use Ledger for my already staked neuron, he said to me : 

> If you staked your neurons using the NNS dapp, then **no** .
> If you staked your neurons using a seed phrase that you generated yourself (e.g. using [keysmith ](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith)) then **yes** .

The problem is that I am in the first case, so I never generated any seedphrase. I created an internet Identity directly through the nns dapp.
Indeed, I am not a seed investor. I entered into ICP in may, so I have a casual neuron created through my II.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-03 20:04:11 UTC | #478

1. It is true that you have created "iNCNs" ( nnsdapp created neurons using internet identity). You have staked significant ICP in those iNCNs. I am in the same boat.

2. Now I wish to "manage" those iNCNs through seed phrase generated neurons (SPNs); bypassing Internet Identity altogether. The definition of management is in above post.

3. In my to-be writeup, I demonstrate how it is possible to achieve 2. The solution is messy and not for everyone. It also involves setting up an airgapped machine. But the overall point is that it works. One core part of that solution is to submit proposal from one neuron to another. 

4. Note: there's nothing preventing you from creating seed phrases today.

In the context of this topic, if ledger could support submitting proposals for a neuron, IN THE future,  someone could build version of NNS DAPP (or similar) that could do 2 above WITHOUT the messiness of my current proposal(3).

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-12-03 20:04:59 UTC | #479

Timo, this is crazy. 

And If one is not a seed, but just a casual investor who created neurons directly in the NNS through the Internet Identity, can we expect to use the Ledger App for our already staked neurons ? Or not.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-12-03 20:07:49 UTC | #480

You are a KILLER ! Thank you so much !
Sadly, I don‚Äôt have any coding notion. So I will be stucked with my casual neuron. But I am so happy for you.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-03 20:13:00 UTC | #481

The point is that you (or anyone else) should NOT HAVE to go through this. This is why I am asking whether it is feasible and reasonable to include this into the ledger in context of longer roadmap.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-03 20:17:06 UTC | #482

If you create a neuron directly through the NNS Dapp, then no, it is entirely separate from the private key used by the Ledger Nano.

What you could do, to have just a bit more synchrony, is to install the FIDO2 app on the Ledger Nano, and use this as an authentication device to your II account. Then remove all other devices beside your recovery choices.

That way, the same device (Nano) is used to access both your II neuron and your Nano neuron. Both will require the same PIN to be entered on the Nano, and your Nano seed phrase can be used to restore access to both (although the technical details of restoring Nano FIDO2 access are a touch complicated at the moment).

There is an open feature proposal to allow management of neurons through extended hot keys, so that you could add the ability to spawn, merge maturity, disburse etc., to a hot key, and then use your Nano as the controller for that hot key. If this feature idea is of interest to you, please let us know!

I am worried this thread, which is called "Seed Round Access", gets off-topic if we take the Ledger announcement and use it to kick off discussing how other groups (not seed round folks) can use the Ledger. Shouldn't we be discussing that in a different thread?

There are at least these three groups:
1. Seed round folks
2. People who haven't staked yet and are going to stake now with the Ledger
3. People who have already staked with the NNS dapp and are wondering how they can take advantage of the Ledger

We should establish best practices for each of the groups. I think we should be structured about the discussion and have it in three separate threads. I expect each discussion to lead to best-practices for each group which can then eventually become a wiki page.

To further this thread, the important point for seed round folks is:
- If you have already claimed your neurons then you can now enter your original 12-word phrase from the seed round into a Ledger and control your neurons directly from the Ledger.
- If you have not claimed your neurons yet then you can either claim right now with quill from a laptop or wait for the very next update of the Ledger app which will contain the claiming functionality so that you can claim directly from the Ledger as well and don't need quill anymore.

This is right. Sorry @timo !

Even though the Merge Maturity option isn't available for Ledger users, you can still wait until you have enough to spawn a new neuron, then dissolve/disburse and from there you can add stake to your original staked neuron, am I understanding that correctly?

So as far as compounding goes Ledger users would miss out on *some* level of rewards because they would not be able to compound daily, right? And also if I remember correctly adding to your stake is a transaction with fees too, right? So with the current state of the Internet Computer app, Ledger users would have some opportunity cost and additional fees to deal with, if they want to maximize rewards?

Thanks to the team for all the hard work on Ledger integration thus far! :slight_smile:

This is temporary. The very next release of the Leder app will already allow it. So I wouldn't worry about this limitation at all. It won't be there for long and then you can merge maturity directly from the Ledger daily.

First of all, can we please not talk about non-seed wallets here, as @timo mentioned. It is very confusing to read the above conversation.

Second, could someone explain the following in as simple terms as possible:
- Can we transfer our already claimed neurons from the Seed Round, which are not dissolved and are staking, to a **new Ledger** wallet?
- If the answer to above is no, then how are we supposed to secure our seed round neurons, since the seed phrase could potentially be compromised? It's plain stupid that we are limited to a non-hardware wallet because the neurons are time-locked (which also we did not know when investing in the seed round).
- Some people above were talking something about issues with Ledger and rewards, and "auto-merging". What does this mean in simple terms? Do you get less rewards on the Ledger or cannot claim all rewards, or have extra fees?

You mean if you just bought a brand new Ledger hardware wallet? When first connecting it you choose to recover from a mnemonic phrase instead of letting the hardware wallet generate a phrase. Then you enter the 12-word phrase from the seed round.

[/quote]

Some people want to convert maturity into ICP as quickly as possible, i.e. at a high frequency, possibly daily. They do this to take advantage of a "compound interest" like effect in order to maximize their rewards. For security, of course they want to this conversion to only require the Ledger hardware wallet. So what are the options to convert maturity into ICP:

1. Spawn a new neuron. This can be done from the Ledger today but is considered too complicated by these people. They want to merge maturity into the already existing new neuron instead of having to deal with a new one.
2. Merge a neuron's maturity into the same neuron. This is possible by the governance canister but the current Ledger wallet app cannot sign the call to that function. The next upgrade will.
3. Put a neuron in "auto-merge" so that you don't even have to call a function. The neuron automatically merges its maturity at a regular interval. This is a wanted feature that is on the roadmap. But it will take some time because it is not a trivial feature for the governance canister as @jwiegley described.
4. Allow to configure a hotkey instead of the controller to call the merge maturity function. This is a more lightweight feature that could be achieved quicker than the auto-merge. I advocate for putting it on the roadmap.

So to answer your question: when you control your seed neurons from a Ledger and only from a Ledger _and_ you don't want to do 1. (i.e. insist on 2. instead) then you miss out on a "compound interest" effect for a few weeks until the first upgrade of the Ledger app. Since compound interest is only significant over longer time periods these few weeks should not matter. If it matters to you then you have to do 1. directly from the Ledger for the next few weeks and then switch to 2.

No, as I put in bold a **new Ledger wallet**. Initializing from the mnemonic from the seed round is not a new wallet. That seed could be compromised. I am talking about a newly generated seed.

In my understanding you are not limited to a non-hardware wallet but you are limited to your old seed phrase. That's why the statement confused me. You mean because the neurons are time-locked you cannot change the seed phrase whereas if the tokens were liquid then you could just move them to an account associated with a new seed. Right?

Unfortunately that isn't possible. Are you more worried about it already being compromised or going to get compromised in the future?

There is an open feature proposal to allow management of neurons through extended hot keys, so that you could add the ability to spawn, merge maturity, disburse etc., to a hot key, and then use your Nano as the controller for that hot key. If this feature idea is of interest to you, please let us know!

Interested ! Thanks ! Is this feature proposal discussed on the forum ?

jwiegley | 2021-12-07 16:15:07 UTC | #494

It is not yet forum-ready, we are still hashing out some details. Recently (yesterday) one of the NNS engineers devised an elegant simplification, so it's still rather in flux even as a proposal. Just wanted to let you know that we're indeed thinking about this!

Could it be possible in a future update?

Well since we waited on this release for several years, and the investment was relatively small at that time, I had the seed in a file on a computer, so there is a chance it could already be compromised. I moved it offline now of course, but what is done is done. Also due to some initial issues with the tools and lack of clear instructions, I did use one-step online commands initially to make some transfers. As a precaution I would prefer to transfer to a new offline/hardware wallet.

Basically if this is not possible, we are doomed to a potentially compromised wallet more or less forever. Since if we want to stake the seed neurons and keep claiming rewards, we can never move them. This is a problem. No offense if you are on the ICP team, but the care for seed investors is seriously not impressive (not to repeat myself too much but including incredibly short notice about the release and lack of correct instructions for managing neurons, initial lack of GUI for seed wallets, mandatory and late KYC preventing unlock at release, mandatory vesting which was never mentioned before, etc).

Understood. For the future possible outcomes could be:

* Change of controller of neurons is allowed. The problem here is that this enables selling one's neuron which in turn contradicts the concept of a lock time because you can vote against the long-term interest of the IC and right after sell your neuron. So one outcome is that someone invents a way to change controllership without at the same time enabling the sale of a neuron. Another outcome is that the community decides that neuron sales aren't a problem.
* A change to the NNS could allow to "schedule" a change of the controller. So for example my neuron is locked with a dissolve delay of 1 yr and has controller A. I give the command to change it to controller B. One year from now the change will take place automatically. But A still has the right to stop the change up until the 1 year waiting period has expired. That is equivalent to actually dissolving the neuron and after 1 year creating a new neuron with B as the controller, except that you don't lose any rewards or age bonus in the process.

I understand that none of this helps if the seed is already compromised. But then again, if those were liquid ICP and the seed was compromised then the tokens would already be gone. We are only in a position to discuss a change of controller because of the locking.

To your 1st point, seed round investors that have claimed their neurons, for those that are looking for explicit directions for using the Ledger Nano the following works:
For a new Ledger, enter your 12 word seed phrase. If you currently have a Ledger that you would like to use, you need to reset to factory settings before entering your 12 word seed phrase. Use Ledger Live to install both the ‚ÄòInternet Computer‚Äô and the ‚ÄòFido U2F‚Äô apps. Using the NNS App, create an Internet Identity associated with your Nano Fido app. Log in to the NNS with this identity and switch to the Internet Computer app. Follow the directions given here to https://medium.com/dfinity/integrating-ledger-nano-with-the-nns-front-end-dapp-user-manual-9c5600925e16 add your hardware wallet, send ICP and manage neurons. Hope this helps others.

Just curious, why do you specifically say to install the Fido app and have log in to the NNS dapp with an II that is linked to Fido?

-------------------------

mbari | 2021-12-12 19:08:31 UTC | #500

Only because I thought I had to. When creating an II don't you need the security key associated with it? Any clarification would be really helpful

-------------------------

timo | 2021-12-12 19:38:04 UTC | #501

The Ledger Nano (with the 12-word phrase from the seed round in it) controls your seed neurons. The NNS dapp is only a frontend that allows you to talk to the Ledger Nano. There are other frontends such as the command line tool ic-hardware-wallet-cli. The NNS dapp happens to require you to log in with an II, but that's only because it is multi-use and uses the II for other purposes. In the case here, where you control neurons directly from a Ledger Nano, the II that you log in with isn't used for anything. You can use any II you want. For practical purposes I would not go through the extra steps with the Fido app but just use a biometric sensor. The Fido app also doesn't buy you any additional security.

No, no chance. The code for it is merged ([here](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-icp/pull/140/files)) but updates also have to be approved by Ledger before the new version can appear in the Ledger app store.

Hi everyone,

I am no longer able to disperse my neurons following the previous instructions at dfinity.com/seed (possibly because nns.ifaces I no longer available and has been removed)

The current instructions apply only to airgapped computers (??), still for mac only (??????) and focus on something called Quill which returns unreadable answers. 
For example: 
quill account-balance: "Response: (record { e8s = 291_721_000 : nat64 })" 
dfx ledger --network ic balance: 0.01 

The Dfinity team is either absolutely convinced that everyone has a PHD in computer science or is making this impossible intentionally. Either way it is unaligned with the vision the foundation has.  
I mean, how hard is it for a multi-billion dollar company with 300 PhD, over the span of 4 years, to create a simple-to-use application that allows access to our neurons without having to spend hours and hours every time trying to guess what we're supposed to do?

Forgive my frustration, it is in no way directed at the good people managing this forum, but it is just ... well frustrating. 

Are there any simple instructions for accessing seed donation (preferably for windows, preferably non-airgapped)?
If not, is there a working alternative for nns.ifaces?  
If not, is there any way to use quill and receive proper answers from it?

Thank you for anyone helping.

-------------------------

timo | 2022-01-01 21:08:26 UTC | #505

Wait, if you say "I am no longer able to disperse my neurons following..." then that means you have claimed your genesis neurons already. In that case you don't need to look at [dfinity.com/seed](http://dfinity.com/seed) (the current updated version) at all because that page is now strictly only about claiming. If you have already claimed then you don't need that page and in particular you don't need quill for anything. 

Instead, you use the Ledger Nano for everything including dispersing. The tutorial is linked at the top of the page [dfinity.org/seed](http://dfinity.com/seed). The link is: https://medium.com/dfinity/integrating-ledger-nano-with-the-nns-front-end-dapp-user-manual-9c5600925e16

You enter your mnemonic phrase from the seed round into the Ledger hardware wallet and then follow the instructions. The neurons will just show up in the NNS dapp and from there you can disperse.

You can safely use the Ledger Nano on all architectures and in all environments. The environment does not have to be air-gapped and the architecture can be Windows.

[/quote]

By definition, if some instructions work on air-gapped setup then it also works in a networked setup. It can only become easier in a networked setup. 

The instructions are for all architectures. It says "As an air-gapped device you can use a Windows, Linux or MacOS machine. Linux includes Raspberry Pi."

Wally | 2022-01-02 15:45:13 UTC | #507

This is interesting. I assumed my neurons were claimed since I received an email from the Foundation that the KYC verification was successful. I was able to dissolve some neurons as well.

However, on the website https://ic.rocks/genesis the status is still "unclaimed" and KYC says "no".

Does this mean I still haven't claimed my neurons properly or is the website outdated? 
Is there anything else I need to do?

-------------------------

bdevelle | 2022-01-02 20:45:39 UTC | #508

none of the commands in the instructions work on windows. 
so maybe they can, but I can assure you nobody I know was able to run the instructions on windows, myself included.

I just noticed that I cant use keysmith commands to disolve and disburse my tokens...

There is this new quill thing that I cant get working.

Does anyone know the exact commands?

What I am doing:
Creating identity.pem file with keysmith
opening quill in cmd
Ive tried diferent commands and none seems to work.
quill --pem-file identity.pem neuron-manage NEURON_ID=XXX account-balance

No idea why ICP has changed the old workflow and has not even explained how to use the new one...

Could anyone explain how you are doing it? I just want to transfer my disolved neurons.

The more specialized and more user-friendly quill replaces dfx for the selected tasks that quill covers. Disbursing is among them. The use of quill is introduced here: https://medium.com/dfinity/introducing-quill-a-ledger-and-governance-toolkit-for-the-internet-computer-1df086ce5642

The command you are looking for is:

`quill --pem-file identity.pem neuron-manage --disburse XX_XXX_XXX`

Here XX_XXX_XXX is the neuron id. Note that you can only disburse to the controller's account. That's what in most cases you would do anyway, so not a real restriction. But with the more general dfx it would be possible to directly disburse to other accounts. But that was also a potential foot-gun if you send to an invalid account. Hence, quill is safer here.

Note that with quill you can only disburse the whole amount, not a partial amount. Again, not a real restriction because that's what people want to do in most cases anyway.

To send ICP onwards from the controller's account you do (after disbursing)

`quill --pem-file identity.pem transfer --amount <AMOUNT> <TO>`

-------------------------

timo | 2022-01-04 08:33:52 UTC | #512

On a networked machine you can send the message to the IC directly like this:

`quill --pem-file identity.pem neuron-manage --disburse XX_XXX_XXX | quill send --yes -`

On an air-gapped machine you can produce a QR directly like this (if you have qrencode installed):

`quill --pem-file identity.pem neuron-manage --disburse XX_XXX_XXX | gzip -c | base64 | qrencode -o message.png`

Then open the image `message.png` and scan on a phone with the scanner hosted at https://p5deo-6aaaa-aaaab-aaaxq-cai.raw.ic0.app/

The new one for disbursing is actually not even quill. The safest and the only recommended one is to use the Ledger Nano now. It is explained here: https://medium.com/dfinity/introducing-the-ledger-internet-computer-icp-app-for-nano-wallets-eed38c549f0d
When first powering up your Ledger you go through "recover from recovery phrase" and then type in your 12-word mnemonic from the seed donation round and then your neurons will appear in the NNS dapp when you connect your Ledger to it. From there you disburse through the GUI.
