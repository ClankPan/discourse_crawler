Has anyone figured out where are tokens rewarded for staking collected? On which address, how often are rewards distributed and if we need to claim rewards?

-------------------------

Capt.Chromic | 2021-05-31 13:57:47 UTC | #311

They did this so that THEY could mop up all the initial hype money that poured in to the asset- by the time you get access to your tokens it will be on its way to $50....or less at this rate, we're already teetering on $100 that could go at any moment- really lost a lot of trust and faith in Dfinity by the way the handled the token rollout and the amount of tokens they dumped on market- the EXACT thing they said they wanted to prevent VC/seed investors from doing by locking their tokens up in canisters with a dissolve-delay timer that only gives them access to a little bit at a time once a month!- THAT is scammy as hell, I don't care how respected the project or its foundation are- that's the kind of shit you expect from obscure/shady projects - T

How did you "lose" your tokens?

-------------------------

sad838348068 | 2021-06-01 17:26:46 UTC | #313

I purchased 122.63 icp, through the trading platform okex, and during the transfer from the platform to another platform, my other trading platform did not receive the icp.

-------------------------

BeckyLU | 2021-06-02 06:37:37 UTC | #314

Not sure which "other platform" you mean, but you really need to ask the customer service of it. The token is in their wallet, but not credit to your account.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2021-06-02 13:17:35 UTC | #315

Any updates on making it easier for seed people to access their tokens?

* hardware wallet?
* ui?

I've basically given up on this project and I've been in since Feb 2017 and feel like the rug has been pulled out from under the earlier supporters. I don't even care about price, just make it a reasonable process for people to access their tokens.

-------------------------

zpe | 2021-06-02 17:17:08 UTC | #316

why is there not documentation for so many things relevant to seed round? How do you spawn a neuron from one that has reached maturity? Fine no nice ui, why can't team provide documentation that shows how to do this via cli???

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-06-02 20:48:36 UTC | #317

One would have to assume that it was a purposeful decision. I wonder why they would do that?

Thanks very much for the document. 

Have you tried `get_full_neuron` for seed neurons? It doesn't work for me. Sends back a governance error with empty error message. `get_neuron_info` sends back correct/expected data for exact same neuron ID (obviously switch to `Result_2` from `Result_1` in `didc` command for proper decode). 

Decoded result of `get_full_neuron`:

`(variant { Err = record { error_message = ""; error_type = 3 : int32 } })`

I get the same error no matter which neuron ID I send in. If I send in a fake neuron ID I get expected error that neuron could not be found.

CAN ANYONE CONFIRM WHETHER THEY GOT `get_full_neuron` TO WORK ON THEIR SEED NEURON?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-05 16:21:58 UTC | #321

afaik the owner of the neuron has to sign the `get_full_neuron` command. did you import the `.pem` from your seed into dfx to run the command?

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-04 16:42:26 UTC | #322

Oh, okay. I'll have to try that. Assuming you mean for `get_full_neuron`. `get_neuron_info` works fine without signing anything.

Also, the IC should return a meaningful error like "signature missing" or something like that.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-05 15:11:49 UTC | #323

Hi @cryptoschindler,

Thanks again for the instructions and clues.

You were right, `get_full_neuron` needs to be signed. However in an air-gapped setup the situation is quite a bit more complicated. And let’s face it, everyone in this thread should be using an air-gapped as we have been urged to do by the Dfinity foundation. Hopefully "Full Custody" and hardware wallet solutions are still on the way.

As of `dfx 0.7.1` we can pass the `—status` flag after the `send` command in order to get our status data back. So this part has recently become a little more user friendly, and I have now have the response data. See here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-sign-using-ledger-send-dfx-to-maintain-full-air-gap/3685/11   

Then the instructions say this which I have not been able to understand or figure out: “However the result is actually a Certificate type that you’ll have to paste into cbor.me and decode"

Here is what I have tried but nothing has worked:

- Try decoding the full response as hex in `didc`. Fail
- Put the response into cbor.me, grab the the {Certificate: <hexvalue>} and try to decode this <hexvalue> in `didc` as a hex value. Fail
- In cbor.me, there is a section that looks like it has converted it into a large bunch of bytes that look like this syntax `\xd6\xe4\x02q\x8e\xe0\x9c"t\x8b...`. This is obviously not hex, so try to decode as a blob in `didc`. Fail.
- According to this post, we must find and replace all `\x` with just `\` so that we can decode as a blob. See suggestion here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/decode-canister-response-to-query-request/4463/2  Removing all the `\x` I end up with the same list of bytes like so `\d6\e4\02q\8e\e0\9c"t\8b...` I try to decode as a blob in `didc` the whole data received. FAILS.
- So then I must conclude perhaps it's some subset of the giant list of bytes that needs to be decoded as a blob? I see the string `DIDL` in the byte data. so I try to just grab the subset that begins with `DIDL` and decode that as a blob in `didc`. FAILS. What subset if any would work? I've tried many things.


Every attempt at decoding this data has failed. I've been at this for many hours now without much help or clue. Supposedly I have the data I just can't view it.

Would you please be willing to test your `get_full_neuron` instructions under an air-gapped / sign/send setup and make sure the instructions are complete?

I'm grateful for any and all help.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-05 16:30:14 UTC | #324

I did test them on an airgapped setup. Usually `get_full_neuron` should just return the result which you can decode with `didc` as described here. You don't to check the request. The error you mentionend means that you're not authorized to make this call.

https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/779549eccfcf61ac702dfc2ee6d76ffdc2db1f7f/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L757

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-05 18:28:00 UTC | #326

Hi @cryptoschindler ,

Thanks for the error list. That certainly makes sense to describe the issue I was previously having where I wasn't signing the `get_full_neuron` request. I've since moved on from that and I'm facing the issue of trying to get the results of the signed `get_full_neuron` request.

I apologize, I'm thoroughly confused by your response. Your document  explains that when we sign a message and send it we will receive a `Request ID`, and then the document says:

`Unfortunately the Request ID can’t be inspected as the Identity on the hot machine is not the one that has signed the corresponding message we just sent.`

Okay. So how can we get more information from the `Request ID`? `dfx canister --help` describes the use of `request-status` but that term does not exist in the guide you created.

When I try to run the command I get the following:

```
$ dfx canister --no-wallet --network=$NETWORK request-status $REQUESTID $CANISTER
An error happened during communication with the replica: error sending request for url (https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai/read_state): http2 error: protocol error: not a result of an error

```

Another reports that he doesn't get responses at all: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/all-dfx-request-status-calls-fail/4477

And in the thread I previously forwarded people have been having issues with getting the status with a `Request ID` for a long time: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-read-the-result-of-sign-send-just-as-we-do-with-call/3652

SO THE STATUS IS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THE GET THE RESULTS OF A SEND COMMAND WITH A REQUEST ID. And I don't see any evidence that anyone else does either.

In that discussion thread a new workaround was suggested that we can actually get results by passing the `--status` flag right after sending the `send` command.  So I tried that and got an encoded result back. BUT the issue as I've previously described is that the results come back as a `Certificate` type and there are no instructions on how to actually decode that data that is coming back in this format.

I sincerely apologize if I'm missing something obvious, but I don't understand how the guide addresses these roadblocks, and I've been keyword searching to try to understand. Again, I'm curious how exactly `get_full_neuron` was tested from an airgapped / sign/send setup? Was it tested in a test environment perhaps? Is there a current bug on the live IC? I'm very confused.

Thanks so much for your help.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-05 19:19:56 UTC | #327

Oh that's totally my bad! It took me until now to figure out that I described this `get_full_neuron` command by using a hot machine. Thank you for the hint. I will update the guide and let you know!

Sorry for the inconvinience

@Claude1 I've been writing a tool that might help you out. You can check it out here:
https://github.com/dfinity/icx-nns/pull/1
You'll need to clone the repo and compile it yourself. 
**This tool is still under works/code review, use it at your own risk. I do not advise staking any neurons with this yet and am not liable if anything goes wrong.**
here is the command
you'll need to `export PEM_PATH=<path to pem file>` first
```
icx-nns --sign neuron <id> full-info
icx-nns send message.json

Claude1 | 2021-06-07 13:15:41 UTC | #329

Hi @prithvi,

Thanks for offering this tool. It looks like a great utility you are building! Unfortunately I don't think it addresses this situation. The tool looks like it is assuming that the identity is on networked machine, and as @cryptoschindler has pointed out we already know that that scenario works and the data returned is easily decoded by `didc`. The problem is in airgapped sign/send setup. In that case when you `send` the `get_full_neuron` signed message, and once you get the data response (the only known way is the new `--status` flag), the problem is it comes back in a `Certificate` format and no one seems to know how to decode the information. I believe @cryptoschindler  is looking into this. Once we have a working solution you might be able to put it into your utility tool as well.

-------------------------

prithvi | 2021-06-07 13:32:41 UTC | #330

@Claude1 no that is not the case, it has support for segregated sign and send.
On air gapped machine you'll do `icx-nns --sign neuron <id> full-info` which produces a `message.json`
On a networked machine you'll do `icx-nns send message.json` after transferring the json file via usb
The tool also handles the Certificate, and outputs `idl` as displayed above. I'll be adding native support for the governance and ledger candid today so that the record/field names will not be serialized like above (removing the need to use didc)

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-07 14:56:38 UTC | #331

Well that sounds amazing. We should then be able to manually decode the `Certificate` response data with cbor.me and  `didc` somehow correct? Any idea on how to do that? Or is it only possible to do it programmatically? Adding in the governance annotations into the tool will be awesome too. Thanks!

Also, will you also add some installation instructions to the README? Not familiar with Ruby and need to understand how to map `main.rs` to `icx-nns` command and install all the packages. Then once I can install properly, I need to figure out how to copy all of those changes over to an airgapped machine that cannot access the package manager.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-08 08:21:51 UTC | #332

I second Claude's response. How do we decode that certificate? It seems you are using the candid crate, but I'm not very familiar with Rust so I have no idea what is going on in the 'Decode' method you use. Can you shed some light on this @prithvi ? Many thanks!

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-08 10:00:02 UTC | #333

I'm not able to build this, what Rust version are you using?
getting errors like this
```
dependency (ic-agent) specification is ambiguous. Only one of `branch`, `tag` or `rev` is allowed.
```

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-08 11:22:32 UTC | #334

Hey Claude, 
thanks again for the heads up! I wasn't able to build @prithvi 's tool, but @PaulLiu released something similar just recently. The blog is now updated and you should be able to run `get_full_neuron` successfully with an airgapped machine. 

Let me know if you have any questions!

https://ic.associates/nns-command-line-guide/#get-full-neuron
(you might need to clear you cache to see the latest updates)

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-06-09 23:47:51 UTC | #335

A response to this would be appreciated.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-11 12:57:03 UTC | #336

I'm also not sure about this. Dfinity has previously said they are working on what they call "self custody" which is basically the same thing as hardware wallet support. Right now you cannot use this "self custody" approach with IC dapps like nns.ic0.app unfortunately.  But I'm guessing that once they have this figured out we should be able to put seeds into hardware wallets and gain access to nice existing GUIs to manage our neurons in the nns app.  

If this is wrong, someone please correct me.

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-11 12:59:49 UTC | #337

@cryptoschindler Thank you very much for looking into this! I'm looking forward to trying this out soon.

-------------------------

oldseed | 2021-06-11 14:18:19 UTC | #338

Love watching the token price just tank and seed people who supported the project 4.5 years ago having no ability to access their tokens.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-06-11 14:41:16 UTC | #339

Not even to sell the tokens but to manage them and spawn to compound. Managing 48 neurons from command line plus all the spawned neurons is not practical. Spawning and staking 48 new neurons every time. 

I was told the NNS UI team is in charge and it would be possible to manage when hardware wallets are supported. 

Who is on the NNS UI team? Can they chime in about hardware wallet support? And what stage they are at?

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-11 15:12:48 UTC | #340

Hi @PaulLiu , Great tool thank you!

Would you be willing to add the ability to simply upload a message.json file to the tool? So the tool would work with both scenarios: QR scan *or* uploading a message.json file directly. I would be very grateful if you could add that to the tool as my setup doesn't work too well with QR codes and I manually copy message.json files. Your tool would work perfectly for this use case as well.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

-------------------------

PaulLiu | 2021-06-11 18:18:42 UTC | #341

Sure, will work on it this weekend.

-------------------------

PaulLiu | 2021-06-11 22:12:46 UTC | #342

@Claude1 Turns out it was simpler than I thought, so the app should now take text input in JSON format. Please give it a try. Thanks!

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-12 15:26:51 UTC | #343

Hi Paul,

It's working! Thanks very much. This is such a useful tool.

One small issue is if you don't give the tool permission to use the camera then it fails and also won't let you use the text box.

Another more general issue is I wish that IC dapps would work in the Tor browser but they don't.  As it is, I have to route this tool through my VPN, whereas when running from command line it's much easier to route all commands through torsocks or something like that. 

Again, thanks so much for the tool... works great.

-------------------------

Thanks for the feedback. Just fixed the problem. So it will switch to text as default if video is denied.

For seed neurons from command line: 

how does that maturity value returned from get_full_neuron translate to a percentage ? maturty_e8s_equivalent = 1_892_091_771

how do you get total balance of icp in a neuron?

how do you figure out how much icp is going to be spawned from a neuron before spawning it? 

how do you check if a neuron is in a dissolving state or not set to dissolve?

how do you add icp from a spawned neuron to a different pre-existing neuron?

delete an empty neuron? 

it seems this was not included in either of the guides

> how does that maturity value returned from get_full_neuron translate to a percentage ? maturty_e8s_equivalent = 1_892_091_771

it says e8s equivalent, which means that this is already the amount of ICP rewards you accumulated. 1 e8s = 1/100000000 ICP. so divide the number by 100 million to get the amount of ICP

[quote="aaa10247, post:345, topic:2765"]

its in cached_neurons_stake_e8s and  you can take the `account` and check its balance direcly using the dashboard.internetcomputer.org

I see: Legacy address, public key, principal id 

Which of these is used for determining the controller Id when spawning a new neuron, and which is used to check the account value of ICP not lockd in a neuron ?

How do you check the ICP balance not locked in a neuron ? Is it the public key you enter here ?http://dashboard.internetcomputer.org

What is the controller?

Bump. Can anyone help with this?  @cryptoschindler 

According to this guide, `"<NEW_CONTROLLER_PRINCIPAL>"` required when spawning a new neuron. How is this new controller principal obtained for an account? Is it: dfx identity get-principal ?

 https://ic.associates/nns-command-line-guide/#spawn-neuron

```
dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet sign \

How do you check your ICP balance that is not locked in a neuron ?

What is the difference between principal id, controller id, and public key?

If your ICP tokens are associated with a developer identity instead of an Internet Identity (created to log in to the NNS dapp), then you can check your account balance from the command line like this:

1. Check the identity you are currently using, if necessary:
`dfx identity whoami`
2. Check the principal identifier for the identity you are currently using, if necessary:
`dfx identity get-principal`
3. Check the ledger account identifier associated with the principal you are currently using, if necessary:
`dfx ledger account-id`
4. Check your ICP balance for the principal/account by running this command:
`dfx ledger --network ic balance`

The first three steps are just to make sure you are looking up the balance for the right principal/account-id. The `balance` command should return something like this:
`1.44177950 ICP`

If you used the NNS app, your principal and account identifier would be different so you would use the GUI to look up your balance.

In simplified terms:

A principal identifier is a textual representation of your identity derived from the public/private key generated by DFX. You can find some more information about this here: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html#net-ledger-id

A controller is the principal identifier that has management rights for a canister. You can find more information about controllers (and custodian roles) here: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/default-wallet.html#_controller_and_custodian_roles

A public key is the not-secret part of the public/private key pair for an identity to be authenticated.

1. What % of seed tokens have people been able to access so far?

2. If we do nothing are we still earning rewards or are we being diluted away?

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-16 06:47:57 UTC | #357

Only the first set so far.

-------------------------

Bit_Zen_00 | 2021-06-16 08:13:06 UTC | #358

If you have claimed the tokens and you are using a computer to manage the seed, and you lose access to that computer. Would the seed still be valid?

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-16 16:48:19 UTC | #359

I want to know the answer to this also

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-17 13:42:53 UTC | #360

Yes the seed is still valid, forever. The seed would be used to derive the same exact private key(s) so you could still sign any messages to control the neurons.

Are any countries not allowed through KYC for the seed round?

-------------------------

Bit_Zen_00 | 2021-06-24 09:41:22 UTC | #364

I have dissolved the first 5 neurons, but 4 of them still appear in the 'Locked' state in [ic.rocks](https://ic.rocks/). However they seem to be dissolved when I run the commands by console. What can be the motive?  How can I make sure they are dissolved?

(When I run the disburse commands, I get a "neurons are dissolving" message, so it seems to be correct, but in ic.rocks, only the first one appears in the dissolving state).

Any idea?

Sorry, this is my fault, my neuron data is not syncing properly. Let me run it now...

Perfect! Now if they are synchronized. :wink:

jonit | 2021-06-26 08:07:14 UTC | #367

I’m trying to disburse a neuron using command line but am getting “Invalid mnenomic” error when I try


ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $seed | keysmith account -f -)

I have previously disbursed neurons with no issues before

my computer has been turned off a few times do I need recreate a identity.pem file with the  seed phrase or am I potentially doing something else wrong?

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2021-06-26 08:14:58 UTC | #368

I don’t use this workflow myself, so just trying to be helpful.

Does `echo $seed` output your seed phrase?

If not, maybe you need to set `seed=<your seed phrase>` first.

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-26 08:21:54 UTC | #369

[quote="paulyoung, post:368, topic:2765"]
echo $seed
[/quote]

I get a blank line when I try that
let me try adding the seed again

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-26 08:27:07 UTC | #370

okay great, now I have a added the seed again, I'm not sure what the next steps would be from this point?

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2021-06-26 08:29:51 UTC | #371

I would expect `ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $seed | keysmith account -f -)` to succeed now, and `echo $ACCOUNT_ID` to show you an account ID.

Like I said, I don’t use this workflow so I’m not familiar with the next steps.

It sounds like you did this in the past so hopefully you can follow the same process as before.

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-26 08:33:38 UTC | #372

I still get the error "Invalid mnenomic" when I try ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $seed | keysmith account -f -)

problem is I don't know which parts of the whole process I need to repeat if I start again from the absolute beginning, I don't want to accidentally overwrite or delete any important files

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-26 09:12:25 UTC | #373

when I try to disburse the neuron I'm getting this error

(
  record {
    command = opt variant {
      Error = record {
        error_message = "The recipient's subaccount is invalid due to: Received an invalid AccountIdentifier proto containing a field 'hash' of length 0 bytes instead of the expected 28.";
        error_type = 5 : int32;
      }
    };
  },
)

Not sure if that is a clue to what is going wrong?

It's my understanding that dfinity will release coin in monthly batches.  Is there any information I could review to better understand these lockups?

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-06-30 16:47:54 UTC | #377

are there any easy to understand instructions for how we access our earned ICP?

Are we able to extract them and add to a new neuron? Or do we need to wait till the Neuron has dissolved?

-------------------------

tavroh | 2021-07-01 15:37:45 UTC | #378

from what I understand you need to spawn a new neuron from the existing one, which will have only ICPs earned from rewards and will have a dissolve period set to 1 day or something small like that. haven't actually figured out how to do that - if anyone else has, please tell me

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-07-01 15:56:05 UTC | #379

yep that's exactly right. Or I could even retake them. Also want to be 100% sure I know how many neurons are the reward. I am assuming right now that the maturity_e8s_equivalent is the actually number of reward icp, and for example 2_182_464_157 would be 21.82464157 icp ?

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-07-04 17:40:00 UTC | #380

Don't know if any one else here has early contributor tokens? It looks like even though we have multiple dfx identities associates with our neurons eg identity 1,2,3,4 any neurons that are disbursed even from neurons associated with identity 2,3,4 with are disbursed to identity 1. At least this is what I am finding. Can someone confirm if that is the correct behaviour?

-------------------------

Blobby | 2021-08-29 15:41:45 UTC | #391

its crazy, why do dfinity expect only people with Linux and coding technical knowledge be able to access their seed tokens. Its really a huge oversight. Ive been too frightened to even try the process till recently, and now ive started its taken me a lot just to get to install the dfx software, and now Im stuck since all I get is the response "dfx command not found". 

@ililic can you pleased help shed light on how to use the dfx - please know that Ive never used linux before and Ive just followed the instructions to the letter and installed the keysmith ok and downloaded the dfx tool using the curl command that was provided, and it seemed to work after I responded y, it said installed in user/bin but after that whatever I do just nothing works

-------------------------

joshua | 2021-09-01 20:26:21 UTC | #392

Hi, by any chance, were you able to access your earned ICP? I can't find any command-line instructions, in fact, I can't even find instructions to see what rewards I'm earning ...

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-09-02 17:01:45 UTC | #393

yes have accessed the earned icp there are instructions around but not much explanation with them as to what they do

So to find out how much you have earned do this

NEURON_ID= put your id here
CANISTER=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai 

"Please note you don't need to use the above canister command every time only once while logged in "
then

RESULT="$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER get_full_neuron "($NEURON_ID:nat64)" --output=raw)"

didc decode -t "(Result_1)" -d ~/Downloads/nns-ifaces-0.8.0/governance.did $RESULT

this gives you amount other things a maturity figure "maturity_e8s_equivalent ", that figure is the amount of earned icp to 8 decimal places , for example 3_532_186_177  is 35.32186177 icp

To get earned ICP you need to spawn a neuron.
To spawn I send it to my NNS account as its easier to manage there

if you have an account there do this in the terminal 

dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call \
rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron \
'(
    record { 
        id = opt record {id = "put neuron id here ": nat64}; 
        command = opt variant { 
            Spawn = record { 
                new_controller = principal "put principle of nns account here"
            }
        }
    }
)'

The principle of your nns account is found in the Neuron section

you will then need to unlock those neutrons in your nns account

Claude1 | 2021-09-10 19:56:42 UTC | #394

Some questions:

1. Dominic is demoing a new Ledger hardware wallet app that can interact with the NNS. Will this work with seed neurons? https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1436315458827915265

2. Where can I find more information on the concept of 'hotkey', what it does precisely with some exampoles and how to use it in combination with the seed neurons? Will the above hardware wallet support work with hotkeys of the seed neurons?

3. Has the Dfinity foundation implemented a way to transfer ownership of a seed neuron from the original addresses to new addresses? This would solve a lot of issues. It has been previously been pointed out that this feature is necessary for security if the original seed is compromised... seed holders must have the ability to transfer ownership of the neurons to new controlling addresses. This of course would have no bearing on the neuron properties like dissolve delay which would stay in place, would only transfer ownership/control.

matherceg | 2021-09-12 17:11:00 UTC | #395

Hi, I have just claimed my seed account and have a few questions:

1. When a Seed Participant successfully claims account and starts KYC, which is the address we have to use in the Field "*Enter your ICP Address*" is this the same as `legacy-address`?

2. Where can I find my ICP address which will show my full ICP balance on ic.rocks. There I can only see my genesis account. I am not sure I understand the difference. Can someone explain the difference?

3. How can I check my neuron balance which includes rewards? From the claim page, I got this: "*We are pleased to inform you that your neurons have been pre-aged! At the moment of Genesis Unlock, their age was already set to 18 months old. This is important, because neuron age significantly increases your voting power and the voting rewards you receive.*"
But when I check my genesis account on ic.rocks, I see only the balance without any rewards.

Thank you!

Ciao! 

i wonder if seed people can access any easier yet? i tried and tried but still can't get thru the seed round access process. :( 

how can a seed person without coding technical knowledge be able to access their seed tokens? after watching Dom's video on ledger's integration, i am curious to understand if seed people will be able to access the token thru an easy-to-use Ledger app? 


@ililic or any of the team can help?
thank you in advance :)

-------------------------

what aspect of claiming seed tokens are you stuck on?

-------------------------

gecko | 2021-09-16 15:20:27 UTC | #398

thank you for reply, at the moment i'm stuck at: "Check your legacy address and balance (optional)" as it doesnt show me the balance, i tried few times and i managed to get to " Derive and import your private key".

when i reach the point where  "you can check your ICPT balance as follow" i get this message: zsh:bad cpu type in executable:dfx
i tired to do the process few times already

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-09-16 15:26:21 UTC | #399

have you been able to list your neurons? how far have you got in the process?

-------------------------

gecko | 2021-09-16 16:05:09 UTC | #400

i don't think so, i got till here: dfx identity import <name> identity.pem
rm identity.pem but then it doesn't Create identity: "jane" or "name" or others.

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-09-16 16:08:04 UTC | #401

is your pem file in downloads?

-------------------------

gecko | 2021-09-17 12:18:20 UTC | #402

no, i can't see it in the downloads

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-09-18 08:27:58 UTC | #403

it might be a hidden file, you can find online how to show/hide hidden files for your OS, but if its not there you won't be able to claim your neurons and ICP.  You need to ensure the PEM file gets created as per the instructions as this links your seed phrase to your Neuron account.

Will the ledger nano integration mentioned at the bottom here work for seed round? If not, why exactly will there be no solution? Seed rounders have a working seed, so why would it be technically impossible to provide a GUI solution for seed rounders to manage their neurons in a safe way? https://dfinity.github.io/ic-staking-documentation/docs/4-maximum-control-staking-option

Yes, good question. i believe so. I talked to the engineers working on ledger integration about this yesterday. We walked verbally through steps which I need to verify myself by doing some tests and then I can update docs.

-------------------------

eagerly awaiting ledger nano steps for seed round people.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-10-05 13:01:38 UTC | #409

For visibility, in theory the seed round folks can trivially use the ledger nano as any other person would by using the 12-word seed phrase.

However, in practice, there are two things stopping me from writing this down in the docs :

* ledger nano does not officially support ICP yet. It is still in beta so one can see the app the ledger dev App Store, but not promoted yet. They are still reviewing it. 

* I want to do more tests to make there are no hiccups. (I spend my days doing tests, QAing, debugging both tools and docs). This part I can do this week.

Claude1 | 2021-10-06 19:37:41 UTC | #410

I feel like this has been asked before we were told that seed round seeds are different than standard Dfinity seeds and so normal solutions won't work... like they use different cryptography or something. I hope I'm wrong about this. I very much appreciate your help and your emphasis on testing. Thank you Diego!

I have been there since the very beginning waiting for seed round access for non technical person and yet there is no way for me to claim.

now there is this proposal: medium com/dfinity/in-progress-nns-proposal-to-end-the-imminent-unclaimed-seed-neuron-sweep-4855ac84357c

So, basically I have now 16 hours to find how to claim?? 

Can someone confirm that when I hold valid seed round I will be able to claim my neurons? and also will these neurons continue to earn?
If I understand correctly, someone will be able to claim my neurons if dfinity foundation do believe them...
