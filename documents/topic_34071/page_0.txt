I need for my project a Motoko (or Rust) function that copies a frontend canister. This is necessary to be sure that my canister does not change if the controller of the frontend to-be-copied re-uploads it.

Frontend methods are listed [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/asset-canister#architecture-reference). I have some difficulties to understand them:

* What is `authorize` and other "authorization"/"permission"/"ownership" methods? For example, what is the difference between `list_authorized` and `list_permitted`? Is it about querying or uploading? (I guess that I don't need them, because it's apparently OK for my canister to be queried from any client and updated only from the creator.)
* How to use batches to upload files?
* Do I need to clear the frontend canister before uploading its new version?
* Any other remarks?
