it runs fine locally fine.  
its a straight up clone of Kyles IC-Avatar repo.  https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-avatar

Dry doing it with `dfx build` and `dfx canister --network ic install` commands

dfx canister --network ic install --mode=reinstall --all

this worked thanks.

how do you see this integrated into an app?  
I am interested in making a registry of verified 'humans'  with no bots.
