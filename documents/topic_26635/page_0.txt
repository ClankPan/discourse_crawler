So I installed the nns-js package in my project and received a lot of errors:

Unable to build or run my project.

According your stacktrace which refers to your local did js declaration files, I doubt the issue has anything to do with the installation of `@dfinity/nns`.

Try to go through your commit history and your changes to narrow down when the issue surfaced. 

There is probably a change in your build pipeline or configuration. If none, then you might need to review and adjust your configuration as for example in `tsconfig.json`.
