In today’s NNS Treasury town hall hosted by ICPJesse, @skilesare brought up the point that at genesis, 5 million ICP was given to the Internet Computer Association (ICA).

@lastmjs replied with a rhetorical question that I believe many of us have been thinking for some time:

> “What even is the Internet Computer Association”?

Apparently the ICA is responsible the [IC Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/), although I believe DFINITY engineers own or at least have visibility into part of that dashboard as well.

The ICA was also the first non-DFINITY named neuron on the NNS.

So I have the following questions:

- What does the ICA actually do?
- How are they managed? 
- Who is a part of the ICA and do they have a board and projects they are funding?
- What overlap is there between the ICA and DFINITY?
- What is the history of the ICA (how and why was it started, who started it)?
- The first picture of a person on the ICA website is Chris Dixon from a16z. Is the ICA an investor shell organization?

If the ICA serves no separate identifiable purpose, and is not owned by private investors, might it make sense to push for its use as the initial endowment of a future NNS controlled Treasury?

During the recent [DFINITY AMA with Jan](https://twitter.com/dfinity/status/1588576940084330498) (at start time = 11:35) Twitter space someone asked Diego and Jan about the ICA, and they weren’t able to answer what exactly they do or what their function/roadmap is. 

Jan responded (at time = 12:40) saying that it was originally meant to be a “very active group of community people”, and then “the foundation wanted to support it”, but it turns out it wasn’t part of their “priorities”. 

Jan admitted that he doesn’t have a good answer at this time, and added that they hope to have more independent groups/entities that will help grow and take ownership on the IC. That’s a great blanket statement for what we would all like to see - but what about the ICA?

Is the ICA a failed experiment? If so, it’s an expensive one - with 5 million ICP given at genesis before any of this community, and now much more voting power. Chris Dixon, head of a16z crypto is on the front page - so DFINITY financial people, please what is going on here?

This has resulted in more calls for transparency around what the ICA is, who runs it, and why they were funded so heavily.

ICA is ICP. Since the rest like DFinity are independent entities making a contribution. ICA coordinates all participants as our decentralized custodian.

To the best of my knowledge this is wrong. Some might even say an outright lie. I tracked down the documents of incorporation in Geneva.

Took a while, but I found the association incorporation number. What I discovered is that, unless there is information missing, the ICA is not a members' organisation, and so far from independent as to be a front for Dom Williams' voting power and financial movements. [The incorporation document says](https://shab.help.ch/publ.cfm?key=3979595)

“Steering Committee: Dominic Williams, from Great Britain, in Oxford, GBR, president, with collective signature of two, with a director, and Bochsler Gian, of Neuchâtel, in Chéserex, director, with collective signature of two, with the president.”

And then a statement of institutional “mutation”:
" Internet Computer Association, à Genève, CHE-132.001.501 (FOSC du 16.08.2021, p. 0/1005271910). L’inscription no 19857 du 11.08.2021 est complétée en ce sens que le membre Williams Dominic est nommé président."

The (seemingly only) member is being made President with the extra voting power mentioned above: henceforth… Dominic Williams.

From what I can tell, the organisation is not a members' association as suggested in the website, at least not constitutionally. There is no publicly available charter, beside this document of incorporation, and the statutes of association do not indicate any requirements for a General Assembly, any process for registering members, any accountability to them, or any members’ voting process to establish the Board.

Instead, the board of these “independent members” is, exclusively, Dom (and his token Swiss lawyer). Dom now personally controls the voting power of Dfinity, openly, and the voting power of the ICA (behind smoke and mirrors). And ICA has recently upped its stake and dramatically increased its voting power. Every time you see the three letters ICA, you can replace them with these three letters: DOM.

Unless I am missing something huge (truly happy to stand corrected and apologise heartily and with a sense of relief), this is Dom’s most scandalous governance outrage yet, worryingly aided and abetted by… Dfinity’s VP of Finance(!). To paint a one man voting cartel as an “independent members'” body representing the community, is Kafkaesque. 

Who **precisely** is the "small group of professionals" (as designated by @paulaitubi ) who vote on behalf of both Dfinity and the meant to be independent, advertised as independent, non-dfinity community members? Why is the independent members’ association set to auto follow Dfinity? Might it be because that “small group of professionals” report to the same CEO, President (twice over), Chief Scientist and sole board member of both boards (with his Swiss lawyer)?

And did you know that ICA gives itself the right to invest, take equity, buy businesses in its legal constitution? In other words Dom can use the ICA for business ventures and then vote for strategic directions that will profit them with its absolute majority? And the funding from this second Dom front organisation, the advertised grants programme: where does it come from, go, who does it enrich? I wouldn’t bet on the General Assembly to inform us in its annual report to members. Because I don’t expect a General Assembly to happen at all. Because from what I can see, no General Assembly constitutionally exists.

And we now find that the defacto voting power of Dfinity, ahem, Dom, is double the nominal one, but by splitting it you manage the public relations damage of even more Dfinity voting concentration, while allowing for even less accountability for ICA?

Constitutionally speaking: 
Dfinity = Dom without community visibility
ICA = Dfinity without even employee visibility 

Dom = sole, direct and aggregate control of Dfinity + ICA + String + ? + ?

And (one guesses) + indirect control over ? + ? + ?

Erm - @diegop or @paulaitubi or even better @dominicwilliams, a straightforward answer behind this association would be nice to have.

In addition, given that the IC-API is [not open sourced](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-view-complete-non-named-neuron-voting-history/15721/16?u=justmythoughts), the community cannot easily verify if any of the content on https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ is legitimate. 

For example, as a conspiracy (not saying this is true), but the growth of the network as represented on the dashboard could be falsified, or certain neuron data (whale investor neurons or Dominic’s neurons) could be purposely not cached in the off-chain cdn that powers the IC-API to hide and transactions that may be traceable back to him.

This is why this kind of misrepresentation exercises me so. There is so much good will and good faith from the community, willing to take things on trust and be encouraged by it. The above should read 

>Dominic Williams coordinates all participants as our centralized custodian

But no one checks, no one verifies, and massive amounts of money flow, and big votes are taken, and the sole decision maker is one man. The concept is brilliant too. If ICA was a *truly* independent members organisation which you and I could join, with a board we could elect, an AGM which would report to us, and voting power and resources to seriously shape the roadmap, then even a hyper centralised Dfinity would be OK, might even benefit the whole. 

I was ready to jump in, warts and all, to make the ICA meaningful and put resources into contributing to the tech. But it only takes a bit of pollution at the mouth of the stream to contaminate the whole.

Leamsi | 2022-11-20 13:32:57 UTC | #13

So I'm not considered just a critic, here is a constructive proposal.

Suatus quo:

[quote="justmythoughts, post:1, topic:15969"]
s the ICA an investor shell organization?
[/quote]

From its legal incorporation doc:

"the ICA may undertake, directly or indirectly, any activity to further its purpose, including establishing representative offices or acquiring equity interests in companies; it may acquire, hold or alienate commercial real estate in Switzerland and abroad, in compliance with the provisions of the LFAIE; it can develop, acquire, hold or dispose of intellectual property rights and take or grant licenses thereon."

One sole person on the boards of Dfinity and ICA. Dom (Dfinity) gives Dom (ICA) 5 million ICP at genesis(!).  ICA is set to auto follow Dfinity. Recently Dom(ICA) makes staking choices in ICA that increase ICA (his) voting power. 

Proposal:

If this is all a big misunderstanding, I volunteer to help the ICA become a real membership organisation. To open up to you all for membership, and have in place good statutes that the membership can change. I even commit from abstaining from membership to avoid any perception of hidden agendas or conflicts of interest.

Better yet, the community here could, via an NNS vote in which all dfinity connected neurons, including ICA abstain, propose a steering group to transparently, consitutionally and in the open assist Dfinity's stated pupose of making ICA an independent membership organisation. The steering group could even have Dom as a non-voting member, as long as the decision making is transparent and accountable. At the end, Dom would pass full board control of ICA to the independent members' body it is meant to be governed by as per its website and leadership statements, in accordance with a non-fictional Charter that is created by the Steering Group and approved by the membership. 

All ICP coins remain in the ICA, and all its voting power, and the Charter specifies clear processes for becoming a member, elections to the board, and an Annual General Assembly with the actual authority @paulaitubi said it already has.

We are one year old. Give IC some time to build out key infrastructure.

The infrastructure won't build itself, especially if the wider public doesn't know it is needed in the first place. @Leamsi is doing a great service to this community, handwaving his concerns away with "the IC is just one year old" only enables the current less than ideal situation to persist.

-------------------------

"Members consist of geographically distributed and diverse businesses and nonprofit organizations, including data centers and node providers, startups building decentralized services and their investors, participants in decentralized finance, enterprises migrating to the open internet, universities and research organizations, educators and many others. The ICA continues to welcome new members that support its mission of stewarding the adoption of the Internet Computer." --- making statements like "Dom (Dfinity) gives Dom (ICA) 5 million ICP at genesis(!). ICA is set to auto follow Dfinity." is hyperbolic.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-20 17:57:31 UTC | #17

Yes @singularity, i love that quote. It excited me to start with. The problem is, as far as I can tell, it isnt true. The legal docs suggest there is only a single person on the board of ICA, and only a single person on the board of Dfinity. Plus a Swiss lawyer required by Swiss incorporation law. The same thing the public records show for Dfinity.

Can you tell me how what I wrote is hyperbole if the person in sole control of Dfinity foundation (Dominic Williams) makes the decision (only person with that power) to transfer 5 million ICP to a foundation (ICA), that Dominic Williams is in  sole control of? How is this not Dom transferring money to Dom, even if it is via a shell? 

And can you explain how saying that the ICA neuron is set to autofollow the voting decisions of Dfinity, is hyperbole, when you can see that's the case? When the VP for finance of Dfinity himself has just posted that "a small group of professionals" make the voting decisions on behalf of both, Dfinity and ICA? 

Do you have any evidence, beside the website, that there are, indeed, 

[quote="singularity, post:16, topic:15969"]
geographically distributed and diverse businesses and nonprofit organizations, including data centers and node providers, startups building decentralized services and their investors, participants in decentralized finance, enterprises migrating to the open internet, universities and research organizations, educators and many others.
[/quote]

Can you give me ANY examples that this is in any way shape or form real? Because the actual legal charter does not mention any of this. 

Can you point me to anywhere that shows these so-called members, if you find any real ones, have any mechanism whatever for governing the ICA? Any indication of anyone beside Dom Williams (and his token Swiss lawyer) having final decision on how to spend those 5 million ICP, or how to use the newly increased ICA voting power?

If you can, I will be truly, honestly, grateful.

For now, it feels like you have a community member asking questions about demonstrable, publicly available, and ordinarily alarming institutional arrangements that point to huge ethical, institutional and economic risks around the person of Dominic Williams on the one hand. And for a huge segment of the community the reaction that follows is not: "why is Dom in sole charge of both Dfinity and ICA; why did he transfer 5 million ICP from one to the other at Genesis; at the same time as billions were moved while investors were locked out; why has he recently engaged in staking activity that has massively increased his ICA voting power; and why is the ICA described as an independent members' organisation in its website, and most recently by the VP of Finance as one whose highest authority is a members' General Assembly, when there is only one person on the board, Dom (and his token Swiss lawyer), and no General Assembly? What can we do to make things better, safer and more above board?"

Instead the reaction of so many seems to be: "hmm, why are you even asking these questions? Do you have a less than transparent agenda?". Even as I've been absolutely clear at every step as to my thought process and motivations.

I believe we will get there. I got into this because I trusted Dom and DFinity first and foremost. The infrastructure is being put in place, and the network is getting more and more decentralized. In a couple of years I believe we will get there. At the moment I am just focused on reading the tech work that is going on in this forum. I am hoping that the ICA will get more and more visible as the IC core foundation gets more complete. As a long term believer in this network, I am comfortable with how things are for now, and I trust that DFinity believe in decentralizing the network over time in a way that bad actors will not sabbotage the work that is being done to complete key parts of the roadmap. This is just my personal opinion. Who knows, maybe if team went about it any other way FTX would have bought up half of the tokens and messed up all the R & D work done since 2016. DFinity will ease out as the community continues to step in progressively.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-20 18:12:48 UTC | #19

I respect your position at an individual level. Perhaps you know Dom personally, and he's a jolly good fellow. But "belief" is a poor institutional foundation. Which is why we have developed institutional approaches for accountability and transparency. 

Wouldn’t it be great if you could believe **and** verify? If when people like me, like @tsetse, like @justmythoughts, like @Zane, asked relatively straightforward questions, you could say "no worries, here are the facts", instead of "O ye of little faith"? Wouldn't it make it so much easier to gain traction and adoption at scale, beyond a hard core of true believers? And is there any reason why you'd rather be kept in the dark? That's good for magic tricks and theatre, where the suspension of disbelief is a virtue. For a collective technology and economic enterprise, this seems less than ideal. I'd genuinely, sincerely, want to join you in belief. I just wish I had the elements to do so.

I will be worried if after 6 years we have not progressed in the decentralization efforts. Now I am more worried of the progress on the technical side, and decentralization efforts are progressing; with key parts of decentralization being laid out (nns, node machine specs and geography, ICA mission, community getting larger, etc). By the way who makes decisions for dev in Ethereum? I dont see holders voting on some NNS or worrying about who holds how much tokens to influence dev decisions. I think we are far ahead of Ethereum in this aspect.

None of this really matters if ultimately the IC is owned and controlled by Dfinity, which in turn is controlled by Dom, some parts of the code are patented and can't be forked so if Dfinity acts against the network's best interest there is nothing we can do with the code without changing parts of it.

I think this may be a misunderstanding.  Taking @free at his word, and I do, these parts of code are patented, but they *can* be forked. I really like this aspect of the IC licensing and give full credit to Dfinity and to Dom. The license for these parts merely forces whoever uses the pantented code to make their own code more permissively licensed, in effect full open source. If what @free described is the case, the code is fully forkable, useable and modifiable. 

The concern you raised about what happens if it doesn't get forked in the eventuality Dfinity went down or took the code private is legitimate. But it ceases to be an issue the moment there is even one full, public fork. So if you forked it tomorrow, the issue would vanish. Would be worth verifying, but it sounds right to me from inspecting the licenses.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-20 19:55:15 UTC | #29

Since I trust DFinity, I prefer they ease out slowly and not decentralize abruptly. FTX impact would have been worse if they did. Maybe now they can sort of accelerate it, but keep the deterministic decentralization going at the right pace. I am okay with the pace, the enemies are still lurking (within and without).

Afaik there are already existing licenses to achieve the same thing, some variation of GPL maybe?
@free specified:

>My understanding of the license under which the code is released is that you are free to modify it in any way as long as it ends up part of the IC. The patents and whatnot only prevent you from taking the code and launching a competing network or service.

An hypothetical IC fork following some drama caused by Dfinity would be considered as "not part of the IC" and a competing network. This is speculation tho I'm not a lawyer or expert in code licesing so it would be nice to have an official statement from Dfinity on what the license actually entails and which components are affected by it.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-20 20:42:33 UTC | #32

I don't think @free's shorthand quite describes it. You can read the licenses here: 
http://dfinity.org/licenses/IC-1.0
https://dfinity.org/licenses/IC-shared-1.0/

There is no requirement for the code to be part of the IC, just that the code is fully open source, meaning it can't be adopted into proprietary code. 

Going from 
https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/LICENSE

These and Apache are the only licenses. 

If as @free says these licenses account for ALL the public code, and all public code is enough for a complete clone of the current IC, then the entire IC can, and should, be cloned.  I haven't verified that this is in fact the case, but for now I am happy to trust @free. At some point, if I return to Dfinity dialogues after I'm back at work, I might try to verify  it. Be a good thing for someone to do, anyway.

Leamsi | 2022-11-20 21:45:04 UTC | #35

Good spot, don't know howi missed that. And you are absolutely right dang it. There is simply no escaping the entire IC depending on Dom Williams. I had truly thought at least technologically, there was a path. And there still might be, as is, but with a serious risk of litigation. 

If Dfinity suddenly closed shop or went private, if as @free suggests the community could keep the IC running with a public fork, it could be argued that it is still the IC, so the terms of the license hold. But it could also notionally be argued that, as a fork, it's not the same. Certainly a lawsuit to settle the matter does not seem beyond imagination.

So even technically, given Dfinity is the host of all the canonical codebase, a post-Dfinity future would not be assured by the current licensing terms, without greater clarity on what the Internet Computer is, legally, and who therefore legally owns it. 

The ideal scenario would be something like a real ICA, so that a genuinely independent, community accountable, membership association, owns and hosts the code, infrastructure and everything needed to keep running (and indeed define) the IC, and Dfinity is and continues to be a major, probably THE major contributor, but not the owner of the project. This means the IC does not entirely rest on one person's shoulders.

As it stands, if Dom and token Swiss lawyer vanished,  were incapacitated, or abruptly ineligible to be on Swiss foundation boards, it is unclear to me what would happen to the entire governance structure. How would you even appoint a successor? And with no successors, what is the legal status of the ICP, ICA, and the IC itself? Woud Dfinity need to be dissolved? Where would the funds go? Would the "small group of professionals" carry on voting on behalf of Dfinity and ICA? 

It is uncommon, but not truly rare for an organisation to lose two board members to any of a myriad circumstances. If that's all the members you have, and one is a token Swiss lawyer, I genuinely don't know what the legal procedure is in Switzerland for settling succession and asset disposal.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-20 22:16:06 UTC | #36

I actually agree with you here. I think this is a wise licensing provision in general. I would not change it, myself. The problem is that it currently rests on top of a pin.

What if you think this project is great, you want to keep building on it, and because 2 people were removed suddenly and unexpectedly from the board, you no longer can, because Dfinity and the ICA can no longer fulfill the requirements of having a foundation board, and Dfinity can no longer function and must be dissolved? Or you love everything about the project now, but Dom Williams is out of the board and so is his token Swiss lawyer, and now you have some form of government appointed Administrator deciding what happens next, without any connection to the IC? 

I know you have a lot of faith, but wouldn’t you at least want to be assured that the IC would survive without Dom? Or is it FUD to want it to, and for a true believer if Dom goes, everything he built and everyone who built it should go too?

I would keep this clause in the license, but I would make sure that the IC can be considered to exist even if Dfinity ceases. At the moment, given Dfinity is the holder of everything, and Dom is the sole holder of Dfinity, the IC you love, exactly as it is now without any changes, is pretty vulnerable.

I would encourage such genuine and deep and unconditional supporters of the IC to look beyond the instinct to defend Dom or Dfinity at defending the IC, not against Dom and Dfinity, but with Dom and Dfinity.

I can honestly say I have nothing personal against Dom, I don't know him from Adam. Much of what I have gathered whenever I've looked does not inspire trust, or confidence in me, but I remain open to standing corrected and see the possibility that all the cognitive dissonance has an explanation (if only ANYONE would explain!). 

I not only have nothing against Dfinity: I hold it in high regard, admire the work of the team and have enjoyed almost all of their posts and interactions. 

I would like nothing more than for Dom and Dfinity to succeed in the dream that brought me here in the first place. It is a beautiful design concept, and I want it to achieve its promise.

The simple, simple point which I'm astonished is controversial, is that I have due diligence issues around the prospect of that success being put in such a fragile place by institutional structures and opacity that depend in their entirely on one man, issues that would be very easy to fix, if the will was there. Certainly a much, much simpler design problem than the IC itself. 

 Is this really FUD? Can you really not tell when someone is fighting on the same side as you, because they are saying the logistics need to improve or we might be on track to fail? Is open eyed frienship not better than blind one? Is design for contingencies not better than design for a happy path only? 

https://monthlymethod.com/happy-path/

Designing for the unhappy path is not FUD, it's designing for success. And you can't do so, if naming the unhappy path is seen as FUD, conspiracy, or an attack on the system. It is the exact opposite: it's how attacks on the system fail, and the system succeeds.

Speaking of standing corrected, I stand corrected. 
I doubted the existence of a General Assembly for the ICA, but have seen the full statutes now and confirmed that a General Assembly is required by law. 

The full, official docs are here: https://www.ge.ch/recherche-entreprises-dans-registre-du-commerce-geneve

Search for Internet Computer Association. 

The General Assembly consists of... Dom and his token lawyer.

How could that assembly grow? By adding members.  To join as a member you need to apply to the board (steering group) which is made up... of Dom (and his token lawyer). 

So a hermetically closed circle. As long as Dom wants sole control, Dom has it, and I suspect the General Assembly will agree with Dom.

Ok, I was sort of skeptical about the whole Dom and his lawyer bit - but its definitely two people.

Who’s this Gian Bochsler guy?

- He’s the head of https://bochslerfinance.com/, which according to their [about page](https://bochslerfinance.com/what-we-do/) is a "Swiss-based asset manager specializing in the blockchain industry"

* He co-founded https://bity.com/

" As a founding partner of the ORIGYN Foundation, Gian specializes in the organization’s governance model, as well as its node and token structure." [Source](https://www.origyn.com/testlab)

@Leamsi He doesn't sound like a lawyer to me - he's a entrepreneur and Swiss fund manager with specific investments in the crypto space.

Hey @justmythoughts, this is why It's SO much better when the community inquires together, than when just one of us checks it out in between jobs and congested chests! You are absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong. "And his token Swiss lawyer" has such a good ring too. But nope, I now don't remember where I got the Swiss lawyer thing, or if I misremembered my own early posts. It does show that if I am an agent of some nefarious agents with huge resources, my masters aren't getting their money's worth, and my full time smear job is a poor ROI!

I think you are sort of winning me over. Possible for you to do a proposal of some sort, but in a way that does not include any damaging/emotion-whipping/hyperbolic statements? You actually make sense that we need the evolve ICA to take center stage, so that DFinity and other ecosystem participants are subordinate to it.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-21 07:41:56 UTC | #44

Good feedback. Tbh, I started as you suggest, and if you look back at my earliest comments you will see how I gradually became more and more concerned, as the issues kept growing and the responses kept not coming or being super defensive.

Weirdly, this time I've been much more direct, and there seems to be more traction and response. It seems that sometimes you need a bit of emotion to reach people's hearts and not just their heads. But though I have been emotive, I genuinely don't think I have been hyperbolic. If anything, my portrayals were better than the reality that emerged when Zane and justmythoughts fact checked me!

The latter makes you wonder, what is Gian Bochsler, who sounds like the very stereotype of a crypto speculator, getting from being on the board of two non-profit foundations over which he shares absolute control? And how does the hugely privileged access to information that gives him, voting power, and roadmap decision making, influence his investment decisions in the $880 billion he manages: three times Elon Musk’s wealth and equivalent roughly to the GDP of Switzerland itself.

I think you should be banned from this developer forum for all the misinformation, disinformation and time wastage. @diegop

Leamsi | 2022-11-21 14:11:08 UTC | #49

Interesting. Happy to be banned if that's what moderators consider fair. I would have thought someone being able to acknowledge errors was a positive, not a negative. I have been consistently stating I would be very happy to be corrected, on anything,  and demonstrating it.

I also don't see how my mischaracterising Gian as a lawyer rather than an investor affects any of my substantive points:

1. The whole of Dfinity has just 2 people in complete legal control
2. The whole of ICA has the same 2 people in complete control
3. Definity and ICA together concentrate an overwhelming amount of voting power
4. Dfinity transferred 5 million ICP ro ICA at genesis
5. ICA was set to autofollow Dfinity in NNS voting
6. ICA recently increased its voting power as a result of staking decisions 
7. The Dfinity VP for finance stated the voting for both Dfinity and IC are handled by a small group of professionals
8. Two people have the power to shut down, set the roadmap, make financial decisions and transfers, purchase equity in companies, and decide what gets rolled out when and how, without consultation, without disclosure, and without constraint.
9. Those two people have the highest level of privileged information, voting power, technological and strategic say so, and in a position to benefit financially from that combination.
10. There is zero visibility for the community into the financial solvency or governance process of either Dfinity or the ICA
11. The ICA is advertised as an independent membership association, but the only members on the steering group, on whom the addition of new members depends, are Dom and Gian, which is the exact opposite of an independent members' association.
12. This creates a single point of failure, and the codebase, infrastructure, finance, direction are all, entirely in the hands of 2 individuals, who, were they to be disqualified, incapacitated or for any other reason abruptly left those boards, would leave the entire IC in danger, without even considering conflicts of interest and the vulnerabilities that creates.
13. The correction, from a token Swiss lawyer to a major crypto investor with interests across crypto markets, makes the 12 points above worse than I originally painted, not better.

No skin off my nose if you ban me because you don't like the facts above. But I suggest if you do ban me, that you will be cutting your own nose to spite your face. If you genuinely think my raising the 13 points above is more concerning that the 13 points themselves, well, I guess people who ignore history will be condemned to relive it, and we're not exactly short of relevant examples in crypto's brief history. 

Ignoring the message to shoot the messenger, is not how you engineer robust systems; nor how you invest rationally. It may be a way to keep the IC dream alive, but not to make it a reality.

In any case, you will be glad to know: it's Monday, I'm less under the weather, and I have work to do and projects to build. This is (no promises!) likely my last PSA for a while. Your favourite fud bogeyman will be lurking for a while, watching with interest, how this unfolds, chipping in if I can't resist, or if I have a bout of free time. 

Good luck @tsetse, @Zane, @justmythoughts and others who care about the IC enough to ask questions that might help it survive. Rooting for you, and believe it or not, for the IC, whose public vision I appreciate and enjoy.

Thank you so much @free for informative, courteous and valuable input. A great example of a great engineer team. Rooting for you and yours too.

Later, all.

Look guys, I have no idea who Leamsi is, but reading this conspiracy theory nonsense I suspect he does not have the best interests of the Internet Computer | ICP ecosystem at heart. @Leamsi perhaps you would like to prove us wrong by telling us who you are, what your background is, and why you are whipping up these strange storms of FUD and disinformation?

Every day, I and others at DFINITY are battling real challenges. People who know me know that I am honest and have only one focus: helping this ecosystem to succeed. I work tirelessly despite endless attacks by shady and sketchy people hiding in the shadows - who usually turn out to be funded by competitors, or have their own selfish agendas. So please excuse my skepticism here.

I simply do not have time to get drawn into discussing batshit conspiracy theories. And I will not. Other than to ask who the hell is Leamsi, because everyone needs to understand more where this is coming from.

For the record. The ICA is meant to be a members organization, but there are two challenges that have put its development on the back burner: (1) there are far more important things for the team to be working on right now, (2) we could not transfer legal ownership of ICP to the ICA for tax reasons; essentially that it would involve a gift, and in Zürich, where DFINITY is based, a substantial gift tax would be involved. So for now it controls voting neurons for security purposes (distribution of keys etc) and that's it. We have ideas about how to fix this, and develop the organization, but it's going to be a major undertaking, and we don't have the bandwidth right now. Period.

As everybody can see, the Network Nervous System controls the Internet Computer, and it's completely transparent. It has been a HUGE success, allowing the Internet Computer to evolve in real time. There is nothing like it in blockchain. Every other chain gets updated by a secret cabal of insiders, or a coordinating for-profit company, getting "validators" (running on cloud) to update. If that's what people want, they can go to another chain.

We are moving into an absolutely brutal market situation, in which Ponzi economics, and blockchains that have learned how to sell chimeras, have turned everything on its head. We at DFINITY will remain focused on doing our best to help the ecosystem through this incredibly difficult time, and out the other side in a winning position for the benefit of everyone involved - which is our not-for-profit purpose. We will focus our time and efforts accordingly. For those at the sharp end, there are very real challenges we are grappling with seven days a week under insane pressure. We will not waver, but it's time for those hellbent on injecting poison and toxicity into our ecosystem to leave, or explain more about who they are and why they are saying the things they are.

That's all I have to say, as I have to get back to work.

Leamsi | 2022-11-21 14:46:53 UTC | #51

Thank you very much for your response @dominicwilliams . Hugely appreciate your taking the time to do so. 

Will DM you my personal details so you see I am just a normal dev and wannabe investor doing due diligence and coming up with really problematic issues. I think given the recent shenannigans with Roche et al, it's entirely fair enough to be sceptical or cautious.  Won't do it here because I don't want to be harassed.

However I do think the questions remain: 

1) are you not concerned that the entire IC rests legally, entirely and exclusively on yours and Gian Bochsler's shoulders and what would happen if you had to abruptly step off?

2) When, as you put it, 

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:50, topic:15969"]
We are moving into an absolutely brutal market situation, in which Ponzi economics, and blockchains that have learned how to sell chimeras, have turned everything on its head
[/quote]

is it FUD to ask for some way of verifying that Dfinity is solvent (for the same reason you want to verify me rather than take me at my word, and I consider that natural)?

Is it FUD to ask, given Dfinity and ICA are non-profit foundations, for the kind of financial disclosures that are standard among non-profits worldwide?

Is it FUD to ask for an equally standard Register of Interests, to verify (not take on faith) that conflicts of interest are taken into account and there is no self-dealing or benefitting from insider knowledge and ecosystem control, of one person,  their relatives and friends or companies they are invested in?

Honestly speaking, would you, @dominicwilliams or  Gian Bochsler, invest in any company or venture that did not give you visibility into those things?

Would a little transparency and accountability not make ALL such questions, honestly or nefariously motivated, a non-starter, so that instead of wasting your precious time answering me, @diegop could point to the public records and say see? It's all there?

If you were me, a developer and potential investor, wanting to seriously invest time, heart and money into the IC (I love the vision and engineering team!), would you, if you learned 2 people controlled it all pretty much absolutely, let no one else in to the governance, and gave no visibility into the finance, the governance or the decision making?

Dude, the IC has failed your due diligence. Move on. As an investor I look at dozens of projects each year and if find anything that I consider to be red flags I simply write the project off and move to the next thing. There is no need to be writing these dissertations and bothering the community and developers who aren't interested in your conspiracies. Do you do this for every company and project you're doing due diligence on? Any links to your critiques of other projects you have invested? Where were you on FTX, Celsius, and dozens of other scams in the space? Frankly the community has entertained your nonsense for far too long. 

Move on.

Personally I only do due diligence on projects I really care about, no point in wasting hours researching a project I have no strong feelings towards.

It's impressive how after all that has happened this year in crypto, there are still people with the "If you don't like it go away" mindset.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-21 18:37:56 UTC | #57

Yep, I am. Moving on, that is, from this issue. Will keep a curious eye, and that's that.

With regard to your question, I did begin all my due diligence referencing my research on other coins and problems I felt were systemic to crypto. You're welcome to find those early posts. 

I am stunned by people's seeming shock at the amount of time I've spent on this.

I invested a net 16 hours of reading posts here over 27 days, and maybe the same writing them: because the IC vision called to me, and it still does, and I really hoped there would be answers. 

4 working days of my life in 4 months, to decide whether to spend months or years building software on the IC. And people here are like what??? You investigated 4 days? You obsessed or a hired by a rival or something? Who DOES that? 

Like... any sensible person?

Finally, no, I did not delve into FTX, Celsius, etc, because the gambling side of crypto bores and depresses me. A few people who spend a lot more than 4 days setting themselves up to win whatever the roll of the dice, building fortunes on thousands who trust their life savings to them on 30 minutes' starry eyed "research". I wasn't into IC for the money, but for the technical possibilities that attracted me as a professional web developer. 

I am delving into some other Web3 efforts now, and hoping one at least has decency at the root. I'm hopeful of what I see from Kadena now, and there are other smaller, Refi efforts that appeal. You can be sure I will be writing, blogging and podcasting about them, whether what I find uplifts or disappoints me.

@Leamsi thank you for revealing that you are a real person. I will not dox you, but maybe you want to dox yourself, to help people understand you.

Leamsi told me this:

> Just to let you know. I’m [real name redacted], have zero investments in Crypto, and love the IC vision. I’d like it to succeed and can only see it doing so if it addresses its governance red flags.

**I will accept this statement as being made in good faith until proven otherwise. Leamsi, thank you for showing me you are not another paid troll. However, we do not want any more conspiracy theory-style investigations into the DFINITY Foundation or its governance on our social media.**

For those happening upon this thread, I will repeat: the Internet Computer blockchain is fully controlled by a permissionless transparent DAO, called the Network Nervous System (NNS). The governance and control of the Internet Computer is fully automated and decentralized, by design. Anyone can propose improvements, for example by submitting motions to gather support for a particular idea, followed by the submission of compiled code that upgrades the protocol, which if adopted, will be automatically applied to the node machines hosting the network. Through the NNS, the network adaptively improves not just its efficiency, speed, functionality, and tokenomics, but also NNS governance, recursively. It is a self-improving network, and this is one of the reasons it is succeeding. Anyone can participate, either by submitting proposals, or by staking ICP and creating voting neurons.

For these reasons, it is wrong to conflate the governance of the decentralized Internet Computer network, which is self-governing, with the governance of the DFINITY Foundation. We are an independent not-for-profit organization that pursues a purpose, which is essentially 1. helping bootstrap the Internet Computer ecosystem, 2. developing World Computer technology and contributing it for use within the ecosystem, and 3. supporting ecosystem participants, with the ultimate overall objective of helping the ecosystem succeed as soon as possible, and driving what we call a "blockchain singularity". We are not an ICAAN (the organization that plays a key role governing the internet), don't want that role, and the network has been specifically designed to operate independently of an organization.

Inside the NNS, which is a kind of autonomous liquid democracy, many people do configure their "voting neurons" to automatically follow the votes of our voting neurons. For this reason, we often do not vote, to avoid accusations we somehow "forced" the outcome, albeit we do think our input matters, and people can unfollow us at any time. Thankfully, other named neurons are gaining prominence too, and are getting followed, which process we actively encourage. Mainnet is only 18 months old, and we expect this to continue for many years. But the DFINITY the organization is not somehow part of the decentralized Internet Computer network.

Although DFINITY is a not-for-profit organization, with no members or shareholders, which pursues a defined purpose rather than profits, we pursue our purpose very competitively, like a tech startup. We are passionate and relentless. Working here is not he same as working in Big Tech. We exist within a tech war-zone. We need to be agile and decisive. We need to keep some aspects of our operations secret to succeed. We need to defend ourselves against near-criminal blockchain "competitors" and their attacks (see the investigative journalism site CryptoLeaks.info, whose reports reflect only a small fraction of what we face). In practice, the foundation council just rubber stamps high-level administrative functions two or three times a year. However, I make no excuses for being founder, Chief Scientist and President of the council. We are a startup, not IBM.

One day we may be nearer reaching our objectives and the market will be more mature. We might be more like a corporation that effectively tends a farm on territory won long ago. That day, we might become a sleepy organization run by a committee. Or we might simply dissolve DFINITY and ask the NNS to take over direct decentralized employment of our team. But we are certainly not ready for that now, and have many more pressing matters to focus on. Having "investigations" of our governance on our forums is distracting and demoralizing. 

**So, I repeat, no more discussion of this here. Thank you.**
