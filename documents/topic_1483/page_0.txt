I had some state in a canister deployed to Sodium, and I ran this command to update the frontend code while maintaining the state: `dfx canister --network ic install --all --mode upgrade`. But my state seems to have been wiped.

States are not preserved across upgrades by default. In Motoko, you can use the `stable` keywords to specify which variables to preserve: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/actors-async.html#_stable_and_flexible_variables. In Rust, you need to provide `pre_upgrade` and `post_upgrade` functions, see https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/blob/master/examples/asset_storage/src/asset_storage_rs/lib.rs as an example.

I see, I don't think the documentation mentioned that. The documentation makes it seems like an upgrade just reserves state automatically.

Thanks for catching this,@lastmjs. This is an oversight and should definitely be mentioned in the documentation for upgrading a canister! 

Please feel free to log issues like this if the docs repo too.
