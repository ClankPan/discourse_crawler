Hello. I decided to stake my ICP for 6 months. Then it looked like, yes, it would be staked. But I would be earning no interest on it. Is that accurate?
I do have the Dissolve Delay active. So, I'm at least earning 6% (as it says). is that accurate? And is this ICP yield that I'm earning and not voting power?
Lastly, when I deactivate the Dissolve Delay, and it starts dissolving, am I earning no interest on the staked ICP? Is that accurate?

At a high-level, your neuron will earn rewards based on its governance participation (i.e. voting rewards). After your neuron is locked for 6 months, it will earn voting power and can start participating in governance. 

A dissolving neuron can still earn voting rewards until the last six months of its dissolve delay.
