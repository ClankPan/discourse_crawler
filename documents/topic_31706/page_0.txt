Sir. May I ask if you are using the Plug wallet to connect to ICPSwap and stake your Yuku tokens?

If you have staked Yuku but have not set the Dissolve Delay, please click "disburse" to distribute your staked tokens to your wallet. Then transfer them to your NNS frontend for staking.

If you have set the Dissolve Delay, please click the "Dissolve" button and wait for the countdown to complete (depending on the duration you set for the Dissolve Delay). Then click "disburse" to distribute your staked tokens to your wallet. After that, transfer them to your NNS frontend for staking.
