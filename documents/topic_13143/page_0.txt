Hey,

I'm quite new to the Internet Computer myself, although being in the crypto ecosystem for quite some years, and in the past few weeks I noticed a lot of differences between the "traditional" blockchains and the IC. Since most of the developers that come across the IC have some prior experience with other blockchains - most notably Ethereum, I thought it would be helpful to have some kind of go-to reference article that lists differences and unique capabilities of the IC.

Since many of you here in the forum have much more experience with the IC than I have, I'd love to get your feedback on the article before publishing it.

Thanks!
