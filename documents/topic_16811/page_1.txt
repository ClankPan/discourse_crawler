Staking of new neurons is not yet supported on the NNS FE but it is on its way (implemented, but under review and testing).
I am not aware that another frontend already supports it.

Thank you, and we do appreciate this feedback!
We aim at communicating more clearly which things are expected where and when and we are working on the remaining features for the frontend as well as on a dashboard view that provides more visibility into the SNS-1 canisters.

Who should implement what is adopted in SNS-1? What are the conditions, deadlines? Who pays for the implementation? What if there are conflicts of interest?

SNS-1 dapp source code?
and SNS-1 ledger transaction history?

-------------------------

These are all good questions and I believe they should be answered by the SNS-1 community. This is something the DAO has to figure out in order to work well. Most likely the DAO would fund its own development using the treasury or minting.

> SNS-1 ledger transaction history?

To query the ledger transactions, you could for example use [this tool](https://github.com/MarioDfinity/sns_ledger).
There is an SNS1 proposal out that proposes to upgrade the SNS1 DAO to a new version. If this proposal is approved, the ledger will be upgraded to a WASM that exposes the candid and as an effect you can see the ledger API more easily on [the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/).
Moreover, we are planning on adding a better dashboard for the SNS.  

> SNS-1 dapp source code?

The dapp is the standard asset canister. I am pulling in people that worked on the details here and we are looking into how we can best publish this.

Still not posible to add SNS-1 at stake?

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-28 10:07:51 UTC | #114

Since last week it is possible to stake an SNS-1 neuron in the NNS frontend dapp if you have SNS-1 tokens.
I hope that helps!

Hi Lara have we seen any SNS1 proposals linked to code changes yet? 

If not, can Dfinity please guide the community by creating simple challenges? Examples:

1. Add a GIF to the website
2. Add staking income to locked neurons 

The dev community needs a little push. Maybe a small bounty would help.

Hi @dfisher, yes, I think the idea is that Dfinity would like to add more information for the native proposals that are supported in SNS-1, so that hopefully helps the community to make use of them. 
As we are rather busy with working on a lot of SNS improvements, I am not sure when we can provide this, but I'll bring it up internally again.

Hi there, does anyone knows where can find the code of how to propose on the SNS? 
I can't find the related code in ic source code and nns-dapp code.

I'm not sure if this is the easiest way, but it is a way at least... [Option 1](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/tests/commands/sns-make-proposal.sh), [option 2](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/master/tests/commands/sns-make-proposal-from-file.sh)
