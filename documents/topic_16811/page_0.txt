This is an exciting week! [More than a year](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/service-nervous-system-governance-for-dapps/6151) after we first started discussing the SNS idea with the community, this week the first SNS canisters were installed on the SNS subnet!

*Why SNS-1*
SNS-1 is envisaged to be an experimental DAO owned and driven by the IC community with two main purposes. First, SNS-1 is an experiment to test the SNS canisters in production while including the whole community in a fun experiment. Second, SNS-1 educates all users how an SNS launch works.

*Where are the SNS-1 dapp and SNS canisters?*
[This Wiki article](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-to:_Interact_with_SNS_canisters) provides more information about how you can interact with the SNS-1 dapp, which is being decentralized in this process, as well as with the SNS-1 canisters. We invite everyone to play around with the canisters and inspect their initial setup.

*Where are we in the launch process?*
The detailed SNS launch process is described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/get-sns/preparation). In the first step, that happened this week, the SNS canisters were installed and the dapp’s control was handed over to the SNS DAO. As in every SNS launch, the next step is an NNS proposal that proposes to start a decentralization sale for the SNS.

This NNS proposal has a new topic which is called “SNS & Community Fund”. The default following of all neurons for this topic was set to the same default following as for the topic “Governance” as this is the most decentralized setup. This setting can of course be changed by each NNS neuron.

***Call to action***
To decide whether to adopt or reject the NNS proposal to start the sale, NNS neurons are asked to inspect the SNS canisters, their initial settings, and the proposal that determines the conditions for the initial sale.

The first two steps can already be done now. We thus **invite everyone to already have a look at the SNS canisters and inspect their initial setup**. Especially, we **invite the known neurons** to do so as they will likely have followers for this proposal as explained above.

*The initialization*
The SNS token and the initial distribution have been shared [here](https://dscvr.one/post/6117895/sns1-the-token_). Let’s recap them for reference and add some more details regarding how the tokens are handed out.

The SNS-1 token:
* Token Standard: ICRC-1
* Token supply: 10,000
* Token inflation: 0 %
* Minimum dissolve delay to vote: 1 month

Initial token distribution:

* 3860 Airdrop tokens - in neurons with a dissolve delay of 1 month
* 50 tokens for Ludo (token design) - in a neuron with a dissolve delay of 1 month
* 12 tokens for 12 SNS developers (to send relevant proposals) - one neuron for each developer with a dissolve delay of 1 month each
* 3141 Tokens sold in the decentralization sale - will be handed out in baskets of neurons to the sale participants after a successful sale
* 2937 Tokens in the SNS governance’s treasury

You can check these numbers by looking at the neurons in SNS-1 governance and ledger canister. All the neurons for the developers and airdrops are already in the governance canister. Right now they just have limited capabilities as the governance canister is in pre-decentralisation sale mode. *(Note: in the future this will likely be changed and airdrop neurons will only be created when the sale neurons are created - we will share a proposed design once available.)*

You can also inspect the SNS governance’s ledger account which holds the treasury and the SNS decentralization sale’s ledger account which holds the sale tokens.

You can find the details on how to do so with the dashboard or dfx [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-to:_Interact_with_SNS_canisters).


We hope you have as much fun as we do seeing the first SNS canisters in action and playing around with them! Please let us know if you have any questions as we would like to encourage as many people as possible to follow and learn about this process!

What is the dissolve delay time for neurons by SNS-1 Token sale?

Is it one or more neurons that participate in the sale of SNS-1 Token?

-------------------------

lara | 2022-11-24 13:26:34 UTC | #12

Hi all, 
just wanted to clarify this about the SNS launch process: we don't know exactly when the sale will start. An NNS proposal is submitted and, if it is adopted, the sale will start when this proposal is executed. Since the voting period of an NNS proposal can be between zero and 8 days we don't know for sure when this will be.

We will let you know when the proposal is submitted!

-------------------------

lara | 2022-11-24 13:29:42 UTC | #13

The dissolve delay for the neurons that you get as a result of participating in the sale will be defined in the NNS proposal that starts the sale, so they are not defined in the canisters yet and are part of what is voted on.
Whoever submits the proposal can specify a basket of neurons, which means that each sale participant will get not only one neuron but will get their tokens distributed accross multiple neurons with different dissolve delays.

> Is it one or more neurons that participate in the sale of SNS-1 Token?

You don't need a neuron to participate in the sale. You can participate with a principal that just has ICP in a wallet!
If you meant how many SNS neurons you get in return, then the answer is what I mentioned above, namely that this will be determined in the proposal.

-------------------------

caolw | 2022-11-24 14:11:41 UTC | #14

Could you announce the maximum public sale amount？

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-11-24 17:36:32 UTC | #15

Parameters like the max investment amount will be specified as part of the decentralisation proposal of SNS-1. We plan  to share updates on this very soon!

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-11-25 17:56:47 UTC | #16

All details on the decentralization sale for SNS-1 are in this [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/93763).

Please have a look and vote!

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2022-11-25 18:09:39 UTC | #17

I understand that the maximum share per principal is 1 ICP. After accepting the offer proposal I just need to send 1 ICP (+ transaction cost 0.0001 ICP) from the main account with liquid ICP? Is it possible to pay with the maturity of a neuron? I ask because I want to be faster than others, prepare myself and have a chance to buy tokens for myself :grin:

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-11-26 03:10:09 UTC | #18

Hi folks. I have a question about SNS-1: it is supposed to be experimental and will have not many functions. Why are people so obsessed with buying the token?
Perhaps I missed something?

-------------------------

Berg | 2022-11-26 06:32:33 UTC | #19

I assume 8yeargang will have priority access to future SNS launchpads.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2022-11-26 12:08:19 UTC | #20

This is the genesis of SNS. The desire to own a token, a similar question to why people value BTC better than ETH. He was just the first :melting_face:

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2022-11-26 12:56:55 UTC | #21

Experimental, but it is a real Dao. The holders of SNS-1 tokens can deliberate and vote to make it into anything. We are writing the future. 
Personally, my fellow SNS-1 token holders, we are at the precipice, we can stand and do nothing, holding only a symbolic token of being first. We can also use this Dao to transform into greatness. I believe we vote to create a meme coin controlled by the SNS-1 Dao, this should generate additional funds for the Dao for future endeavors and will be the first step to our greatness. We should not rest on being first.
The IC is One Blockchain to Connect Them All… blockchains, friends, adversaries, all man-kind.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2022-11-26 14:28:55 UTC | #22

In my opinion, the first SNS-1 should become a search/list of all DAOs that will be created in the future. One and without any restrictions, as happens in other centralized ones, where search results are often blocked under the pressure of local totalitarian governments. Protecting our privacy and the right to access knowledge from around the world, or maybe Wikipedia created anew? Can come up with a lot, I think it's one of the first topics that should be voted on when the sale is done!

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-26 14:39:28 UTC | #23

I think that's a great idea! All of those! It could be a community led effort to accomplish something like a wikipedia

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-26 14:43:43 UTC | #24

To me, it has a lot to do with nostalgia I guess you could say. As others have said, it's the genesis of SNS-1. Imagine looking back years later and thinking, wow. I was there in the action when this stuff was being developed.

-------------------------

ildefons | 2022-11-26 14:51:09 UTC | #25

I would love SNS-1 to become the seed for a wikipedia in the Internet Computer. Contributors could be paid with governance tokens. This would attract a lot of eye balls not just on the SNS-1 tokens but on the IC. The awareness of this project could propell token prices which would be a source of development funding

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-26 14:54:46 UTC | #26

I feel like a good idea would be to incorporate audience rating. This would be so that the audience could rate the article for truthfulness. One of the problems with Wikipedia is that occasionally there will be a bogus article. If there was an audience rating then that would tell people that this might be or might not be a good source of information. And the audience could use tokens to rate the article

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2022-11-26 15:15:59 UTC | #27

One could even think of introducing a little inflation in the future to accompany the scoring of content such as Instagram likes. Each creator would be rewarded with tokens from it, which would drive further development. However, I believe that it should be at the maximum level of 5%.
In addition, to reduce spam, it is worth creating a "white list" of creators, people on it would be full-time employees, but elected in periodic social elections. But that's just my vision, fantasy.
However, the initial challenge is obtaining the capitalization by the DAO that will allow the implementation of the investment. Undoubtedly, it will be a challenge for the whole community.

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-26 16:07:50 UTC | #28

Another idea for the first SNS-1 launch would be that it's a DAO for new launches. When I say this, I mean that in order for a new project to launch on the launchpad, the SNS-1 DAO would have to vote to approve the launch. This could help in case it might be a rugpull or something like that. Not sure if there are already safe guards to stop rugs but I thought this might be a good idea to give SNS-1 some utility

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2022-11-26 20:01:51 UTC | #29

NNS Dapp not works. It's been like this for several hours. I think it's because of Launch SNS. Now the question is whether the DFINITY neuron is going to vote: if so, the sale will start at a random moment within 3 days and people will stop checking the NNS every 5 minutes, and if not, they servers goes down for the next 3 days because without the foundation's vote the proposal is not able to achieve absolute majority.

And referring to your statement: the idea makes sense at this point, it would be a perfect relief of NNS in such critical moments.

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-26 20:13:08 UTC | #30

Yeah I was a little confused as to when the sale would start. This tweet clears things up a bit but who knows. Plans could change. Glad to know I'm not the only one checking NNS every 5 minutes lol

DHemingway | 2022-11-27 09:09:38 UTC | #32

Thoughts on the SNS-1 Dao launching a meme coin. *Just notes - white paper still needed* For these purposes will call the meme coin the “Hemingway” but I think it should be named after a “key” Internet Computer or SNS contributor, as it should.

1)This will be a 3-coin system. SNS-1 serves as the governance token of the Dao, the creator of the Hemingway, thereby the SNS-1 will also govern the Hemingway. 

2)SNS-1 publicity creates tailwinds to launch the Hemingway, there is free publicity and marketing. The scarcity of not being able to own SNS-1 will drive some purchases of owning the Hemingway. It’s pure speculation to own the Hemingway, the first Dao controlled meme coin on the IC, if I’m not mistaken.

3)ICP raised from the sale of Hemingway meme coin is used to generate future returns within the ICP DeFi ecosystem and a percentage of profits will be used to buy & burn Hemingway’s on a cyclical basis as decided by the Dao. Or, my personal preference, a percentage of ICP from the initial Hemingway sale is locked 🔒 in 8-year non dissolving neurons for entirety and a percentage of Maturity is used to buy and burn 🔥 the Hemingway on a cyclical schedule or as determined by the Dao, or a combination of the 2. ICP ecosystem benefits by having ICP staked forever - we all want this.

Summary: We have 3 coins, SNS-1 governs the meme coin called the Hemingway. The Hemingway serves no purpose, it is a speculative meme coin. ICP generated from the sales of Hemingway are staked forever, using a percentage of Maturity to buy back Hemingway and burn it, reducing supply. This will result in a more favorable financial climate for the SNS-1 Dao so it can do more meaningful endeavors in the future, while benefiting ICP and Hemingway token holders.

-------------------------

JxBrian | 2022-11-27 13:59:46 UTC | #33

@DHemingway  I like the point that you had raised; they have heightened the possibility of what is possible with Sns-1. 

I however see the transformation from the name of SNS-1 to VISION 2030 to stick more with the community. 

Why VISION 2030? 

1. First, we could highly want as a community to extend the culture of 8 year gang; within this generation and the generations that come after. 

SNS-1 was born in 2022 and hence 2030 lies after 8 years. 

2. Motoko, the native language for the IC logo is designed to have glasses. That would make it easier for new developers in the near future to understand this vision. 
While they learn and develop their projects, they are likely to refer back and see why, how and what happened to VISION 2030. 

3. VISION 2030 is all inclusive name within all cultures of the word; it is easily understandable. 

A problem with naming in the scientific community, especially in chemistry and biology comes when scientists named compounds and processes after themselves; what arised are complex names that students decades after would not memorize. 

4. Upon acceptance of a proposal to change the name from SNS-1 to VISION 2030, the community can see how true decentralization works. 
ie, working as a community. Some people work on the immediate software, some work on the token in place, some by voting and some by just making simple contributions. What would emerge is a masterpiece like never seen before; it’s worth a shot 💯

So I genuinely ask the community… what would you like your VISION 2030 to be? Please comment below and as My grandfather used to say the best day to start was yesterday, today it might be too late and tomorrow is not promised. As community members your immediate response is highly encouraged; WHAT IS YOUR VISION 2030?

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-27 15:34:14 UTC | #34

I would reject any proposals to have SNS-1 be anywhere near a memecoin. The technology is just too amazing to be associated with a pump and dump memecoin

Elephantul | 2022-11-27 18:03:50 UTC | #35

There were problems with some nodes on the NNS subnet. After switching them out everything should be working again.

Even if the NNS were down, people (including the foundation) are still able to vote through other means, most commonly over CLI using [quill](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/).

Tromix | 2022-11-29 17:07:07 UTC | #38

Why on earth did you make the process to buy in or participate so profoundly difficult?

Serious. I tried to figure out how to participate, but it was like “be at this location, on a tuesday, with a full moon, upside down, while raining” in order to get in.

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-29 17:35:49 UTC | #45

Lol it's not a crash. There's a difference between overloaded and a crash. Also, just because the WEBSITE was overloaded, doesn't mean it has anything to do with the BLOCKCHAIN. In fact I KNOW it had nothing to do with the ICP's blockchain infrastructure. Have you ever been to a website that has so much internet traffic that the website is "down"? It happens. It's something the team needs to address but damn it doesn't mean ICP as a blockchain is at fault.

[quote="ewebb6, post:45, topic:16811"]

[/quote]
The NNS is hosted on chain.
Therefore the chain got “overloaded”.
A couple hundred people simultaneously try to sign up for a donation, and it overloads and crashes.

You can cope and seethe all you want, but it wont change perception of the average person who just watched the poop festival play out over the last 15 minutes.

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-29 17:53:12 UTC | #47

We should wait until a team member can answer, but I completely disagree. Check this link out and you'll see that ICP as a blockchain was fine. The problem lies with the NNS Dapp. Just because ONE dapp is overloaded, it does not mean the entire chain is overloaded. Again, it shouldn't happen and needs to be addressed. However, I just think it's very disingenuous to act like the entire chain got overloaded. If a team member comes out and says yeah the entire chain got overloaded then I will be the first to admit that I was 100% wrong. Until then, I'll wait for answers.

As a new participant of this DAO, I would like to offer to make it an inaugural VR space, running inside a canister. I've made a few of these, under the banner of the [Island Collective](https://islandcollective.icp.host). This would be a personal effort, directed towards whichever needs the DAO agrees on, and would be entirely free and open-source from the outset, and could act as both a hub and template for future canisters, plus a talking point, stage for further development, and so on

If there is ♡ for this idea, I will happily start to draw up an initial feature list, based on what’s possible so far, and what could be achieved with time, and then I guess I would think about polling for ideas for VR spaces.

This is not crash on ICP, but only one part of the nns dapp. You will note that other parts of the nns dapp other than launchpad were ok. I didnt get through, but I wont whine.

-------------------------

Berg | 2022-11-30 06:47:17 UTC | #59

I think the SNS neurons should show up at the same page as regular neurons by default on the NNS page. Maybe add a filter if the user wants to examine only a particular neuron group.

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-11-30 08:01:57 UTC | #60

From @ewebb6's link:

> The decentralization sale is finished and the neuron distribution has started, they should all be distributed over the next 24hrs. This is slower than we’d like, but something we hope to improve in the future. Those who participated in the airdrop should see their SNS-1 neurons already.

[/quote]

The minimum dissolve delay for participation in governance is 1 month. 

As per the initial configuration, SNS-1 will not distribute any voting rewards, i.e., the reward rate is zero. This configuration could however be changed by proposal, if approved by the SNS-1 community.  

And yes confirmed: You can increase the dissolve delay (staking time) at any time for a neuron. This applies for a dissolved neuron, but also for a dissolving/non-dissolving neuron. 

Please let me know if this clarifies your question.

Its closing in on 24hrs since ICP left our wallets and got sent to the addy. Wonder whats holding it up.

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-11-30 16:54:18 UTC | #65

The neurons are distributed by now. There is an edge case where ICP was sent but not registered as participant in the sale. These people will get their refunds, but no hard ETA yet for that

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-11-30 16:58:32 UTC | #67

Dang so if it says we comitted 1 ICP but we still haven't received our SNS-1 token then that means we are apart of that edge case?

-------------------------

Does it say 'committed' or did you 'only' have ICP deducted from your account?

I'll ask the experts to be certain.

ewebb6 | 2022-11-30 17:01:52 UTC | #69

Oh actually no worries, I just checked again and it's there now!

More than 33 hours and haven’t t received my  sns1 yet 
What’s the problem?

-------------------------

darien | 2022-12-01 02:56:06 UTC | #73

@Bashir have you check under *Neurons*....SNS-1
I kept on checking under *Tokens* thinking that it was there...but I found them under *Neurons*

-------------------------

Bashir | 2022-12-01 03:12:30 UTC | #75

Yes it’s under the neurons thanks for your help 🙏

What is the Token Canister ID for sns-1? I would like to add it on Plug, if Plug supports ICRC-1

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2022-12-01 11:47:52 UTC | #77

The ledger canister id is zfcdd-tqaaa-aaaaq-aaaga-ca

The canisters are discoberable with the sns-js library we built: https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/sns

You can interact with the canisters directly wht the wrapper we provide there and passing only the root canister id of the SNS-1 project: zxeu2-7aaaa-aaaaq-aaafa-cai

You can see this canister id in the url with the query parameter `u` when you are in the project page or the accounts of sns-1.

I hope that helps!

How can the SNS neuron be top up? Where can I see my neuron address to do it?

-------------------------

Berg | 2022-12-02 04:25:29 UTC | #79

Good thing we got refunded 1 ICP when SNS1 is trading at 95x. :clown_face:

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-02 11:09:25 UTC | #80

It should have appeared in the meantime. Is this correct?

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-02 11:11:51 UTC | #81

Thanks for the feedback! 
We chose to prioritise first adding all features (e.g.,all neuron functions) and then improve the rest, such as how one can see the tokens / neurons from the different DAOs.
Such feedback will be useful for this next step!

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-02 11:13:58 UTC | #82

The functionality to increase the dissolve delay is not yet on the frontend. 
We are working on adding all such neuron functionalities!

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-02 11:18:15 UTC | #83

Did you check in the "neurons" tab then select "SNS-1"? It should have appeared there by now.
Edit: saw a few messages later that you seem to have found it. Glad you did!

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-02 11:18:49 UTC | #84

You mean the ledger canister of the SNS-1 DAO, right? 
This should be it: zfcdd-tqaaa-aaaaq-aaaga-cai 
You can also read [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-to:_Interact_with_SNS_canisters) how to find and interact with the SNS-1 canisters

Edit: just saw that there was an answer already. Maybe the Wiki link is still useful for others again, so I'll leave it here :)

FranHefner | 2022-12-02 12:48:09 UTC | #85

Thank you very much for the reply ! Looking at the current conditions, there is something important... what will be done with the accounts that used bots? Can you directly propose that the neurons be removed from the bot accounts? if it is proposed and people vote, there is still a chance to get those SNS back. Thank you very much !

plus: Then I see many accounts with many sns, 10 30 60 !? are they real? How can someone have so many staking? Trade was minimal (this volume was not reached) does the blockchain show those with the most sns? where is the data? Thank you!

Dfinity Team,

There is much confusion right now on how governance with the SNS-1 and SNSs in general will work. For example, I didn't realize that proposals related to the SNS do not show up on the dashboard page and only show up, for now at least, in OpenChat. 

This is in my opinion a big oversight. Having an easy way to vote is a ESSENTIAL part of being in a DAO. We really some good and easy UI for voting to come out ASAP. IMO it should be available on both the dashboard and on the NNS dApp, and potentially elsewhere. 

Please let us know if there's a plan.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2022-12-03 00:43:16 UTC | #88

For any SNS1 token holders that don’t have an Open Chat login yet, please use my link below to get started so you can take part in SNS1 governance:

1) https://oc.app/?ref=r5szg-lyaaa-aaaaf-ae2pa-cai

2) create your username, profile, etc

3) verify your account with your phone # 

4) Join the SNS-1 Proposals chat

5) Take your User Id from the bottom of your Open Chat profile page and add it as a Hotkey in your SNS1 Neurons, so you’re eligible to vote on the proposals. 

Thanks for using my referral link! Let’s grow the Internet Computer, one DAO at a time.

Why are there two SNS-1 swap canisters with the same canister ID?

![Screenshot 2022-12-02 at 10.20.47 PM|690x344](upload://6QVhmqMHpy9frUqr7R3FX5YyyUv.png)

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-12-03 06:40:38 UTC | #90

Moreover, why are the dapp canisters hosted on a different subnet?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-12-03 06:42:39 UTC | #91

It would also be nice if you could share a link to the source code of the SNS-1 (even if it's very simple).

How can i add an SNS-1 neuron?

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-12-04 02:22:32 UTC | #93

Looks like a bug related to case sensitivity. Thanks for flagging!

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-12-04 10:47:23 UTC | #94

I have been thinking about this too. On DSCVR, I put forward the idea to try and freeze the undissolved SNS1 tokens that are linked to known bot-farmers. This, apparently, is not really a possibility because these neurons can't be tracked down.

I have a couple of other ideas, which I am happy to have shot down, to try and draw out the bot/human divide:

1) we set up a new ledger of SNS neurons, which is populated and reviewed by members of the dao, that has the aim of showing that each neuron is controlled by a human. Each neuron could submit the neuron id and some form of proof of humanity, which would trigger a review process.The idea of vouching for people could be used, or a random human neuron could be assigned to check the PoH content.

2) we could design proposals in a way that tricks bots, and identify them that way. One possibility is to have a window inside the voting period that (in)validates the vote. So if a proposal includes the message "do not vote for the first day", all the votes in that time could be considered bots. There would probably need to be a 3 strikes rule or quarantine/appeal process.

-------------------------

anonymous | 2022-12-04 11:11:15 UTC | #95

Bot or not, I'm against the idea of freezing funds. I dont think it would be a good look for the ecosystem if it'd be easy to just freeze anyone's funds, especially for a test token. We should instead find ways to prevent this from happening in future sales, which your ideas are a good start.

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-12-04 16:08:23 UTC | #96

I don't think your second idea would work. There are people who code the bots and they're smart enough to just add some additional code to make sure that they don't vote in the proposals or whatever you suggested.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-12-04 22:46:05 UTC | #97

In the UK there are lots of free parties whose location is a secret until only just before the event. It works surprisingly well. I am kind of suggesting something similar, but rather than share a location, share some other information last minute, like the approved voting slot, but it could be something else, like a canister address for voting. 

I guess I like this idea because it's a social solution, rather than a technical one, but it does rely on the social contract of keeping secrets from the machines. Regular showings of Terminator would probably help.

-------------------------

ewebb6 | 2022-12-05 00:19:44 UTC | #98

definitely an interesting idea

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-05 09:45:39 UTC | #99

Hi @dfisher ,
we agree that voting is an essential part of the DAO and it is definitively the plan to add this to the NNS frontend dapp. 
AFAIK it is not planned to add it to the dashboard (I am not sure how easy it would be as AFAIK there is no notion of "logged in principal" or similar on the dashboard yet).

It was a tradeoff whether we want to wait for all features to be ready to launch the first SNS or whether we want to go ahead and already take the opportunity to learn and collect feedback about the parts that we had. As SNS-1 was supposed to be an experiment and test and as we knew that through OpenChat there will at least be some frontend for neurons to vote, we decided to go ahead and keep adding features as they are ready.
Edit: Just learned that you can also [vote on dscvr](https://dscvr.one/post/6617185/vote-on-sns1-proposals-via-dscvr)

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-05 09:36:28 UTC | #100

In short, the idea is that the SNS subnet only hosts SNS canisters that run wasms that have been vetted by the NNS.
Also, this SNS subnet has a higher replication factor (more nodes) than other applications subnets currently do.
These two things should provide more security for the sensitive SNS canisters. This is explained in more detail in the original design discussion that was presented [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-deployment-and-upgrades-design-proposal/10816).
Please let us know if you have further questions!

[/quote]

Hi @lara, is it possible for an sns on an sns-subnet to upgrade it’s governance canister wasm to something different then an NNS-vetted wasm?

-------------------------

bytesun | 2022-12-06 17:58:35 UTC | #102

where is the SNS-1 source code?
how to get SNS-1 transaction history?

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-06 19:40:03 UTC | #103

No, this is not possible. The current design only allow upgrading to wasms that are vetted by the NNS. The idea is that this makes it easier for users to verify the SNS canisters: they don't need to verify all individual wasms, they can either trust the NNS to have vetted them or even if they want to verify themselves, they just need to verify at one place rather than for each individual SNS

-------------------------

lara | 2022-12-06 19:40:39 UTC | #104

Do you mean the source code for the SNS-1 dapp or the SNS-1 canisters?
By "transaction history" do you mean all ledger transactions?

-------------------------

bytesun | 2022-12-10 16:53:31 UTC | #105

SNS-1 dapp source code?
and SNS-1 ledger transaction history?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-06 20:06:10 UTC | #106

Thanks for your response. I do understand that its a tradeoff between speed and having full features but I think the communication around what has been built and what hasn't been built could have been improved. Everything is OK provided the community is just kept in the loop and these shortfalls do not come as a surprise. 

I provide this feedback with love and am excited for what is to come.
