A bug has been found in the newest version of the Internet Computer app (3.0.3) on Ledger devices that prevents some functionality from working. If you have not done so, **do not update the Internet Computer app on your Ledger device!** However, your assets controlled by the Ledger are safe, and not affected by this update.

### Functionality affected

* Listing neurons in the NNS dapp (if you have not added your NNS dapp principal ID as a hotkey)
* Sending ICP using the Ledger Live app

Note: sending ICP, staking and managing neurons from an account controlled by your Ledger device using the NNS dapp is unaffected.

## What this means for you

If you have already updated the Internet Computer app to 3.0.3, and you need to transfer ICP from an account controlled by your Ledger device, you can use the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/).

In case you havenâ€™t added your NNS dapp principal ID as a hotkey to your neurons, you will need to wait until the fix is deployed and upgrade to the next version. We are aware of the issue, and working on the fix.
