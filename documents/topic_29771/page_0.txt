What I am trying to do is to distribute an ICRC token among the [EXT](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/extendable-token) NFT owners. There is a [getRegistry](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/bvckr-laaaa-aaaak-acgkq-cai#getRegistry) that returns the Account Ids of the owners. However it is not possible to make an icrc1_transfer knowing only Account Ids. What could be a possible workaround for this? Perhaps someone has faced a similar task or knows how to get a Principal Ids of owners from EXT standard?

That's sadly not possible, account hashes (as seen in EXT and original ICP) are a one way hash. 

Only idea that comes to mind would be to make a canister that allows EXT owners to claim ICRC tokens, once they make a canister call with their EXT token id and subaccount bytes as arguments, you can hash the caller principal with the subaccount bytes and verify if this matches the account hash that holds the given token id.
