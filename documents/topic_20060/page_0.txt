I created a new identity and gave it the name of a principal i use + set a password.
When I use any critical dfx command in the root folder of the project like

**dfx deploy**

I get a prompt to

**Please enter the passphrase for your identity: [hidden]**

And carefully enter my pw but it still fails with the following err

**Error: Failed to create AgentEnvironment.**
**Caused by: Failed to create AgentEnvironment.**
**  Failed to create AgentEnvironment for network 'local'.**
**    Failed to decrypt PEM file: /home/me/.config/dfx/identity/myidentity/identity.pem.encrypted**

Is there a solution or am i missing something ?
Feel free to ask me to elaborate, thx

This error comes from [these lines](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/dfx-core/src/identity/pem_safekeeping.rs#L222-L224):
```rust
    cipher
        .decrypt(nonce, encrypted_content.as_ref())
        .map_err(DecryptContentFailed)
```

The most likely source is a wrong password, but not 100% sure. Do you maybe have capslock on? We don't get any more useful information from the decryption library :frowning_face:
