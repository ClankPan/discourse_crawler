Saw this article and was wondering what effect these superconductors and their 100X performance gains would have on the Internet Computer of the future, assuming this technology rolls out in 10-15 years.

Where might we see the biggest performance improvements on the IC if nodes were to gradually upgrade? Consensus and inter-canister calls? Canister throughput? What else?
