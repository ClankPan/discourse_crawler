In the future, the use of NNS will spread widely. Have you thought about blocking advertisements by submitting a proposal at a cheap price and getting a lot of views?

or even worse - scam proposals.
in the cosmos governance scammers are accepting the loss of their proposal deposit after being rejected by a - no with veto - vote, just for 2 weeks of free trapping potential time, where wallet logged in users might hit a scamming link.

This isn't an easy fix. Not just for ICP but all blockchain governance. The balance is between being 'open to all' and being closed to spammers. You could make each proposal cost 100 ICP but this then makes it governance for the rich only. 

Maybe there should be a locked amount which is held by the NNS until the proposal is either accepted or rejected. If during this time the proposal is voted as spam X number of times (needs a way to flag/ vote on this) the locked ICP is burned or sent to the community fund. 

This way there is a two tier cost for proposals. A low cost for non-spam and a high cost for spam.

@2vxsx-fae Great idea. A report button should be added

In Britain, [petitions need 10,000 signatures](https://petition.parliament.uk/help).  If a petition gets that much support, it is addressed in parliament.  Translating this to ICP, even if there is a high fee, as long as there is a way of garnering support, that fee will be paid, even if the proposer doesn't have lots of ICP.  E.g. you could discuss an idea in a forum, then when you think you have formulated a good idea, formulate a proposal.  Then you could have a state where proposals are submitted but not paid yet and not published yet.  You would share the link to the pre-proposal to potential supporters.  If they contribute enough funds, the proposal is published and the normal rules apply.  If the pre-proposal doesn't get enough support, funds are returned.  Critically, there is no free advertisement in this pre-proposal stage.  It's just an idea; it doesn't completely solve the problem of rich kids having it easier.  If they can pony up the fee without garnering support first they have fewer hoops. On the other hand, building support is generally a  good idea before making a proposal and improves the probability of success.  The rich kid making proposals might just be throwing away their money if they skip the consensus-building stage.  Thoughtful rich folks will probably want to go through the consensus building anyway.
