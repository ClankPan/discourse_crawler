I am trying to upload 1.74Gb file over to asset canister, but without luck - yesterday it was 504 error, today it is http2 error with weird ending: "protocol error: not a result of an error"
```
➜  thirst git:(main) ✗ dfx deploy --network=ic

An error happened during communication with the replica: error sending request for url (https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/vwk6n-XXXXX--cai/call): http2 error: protocol error: not a result of an error
```

With local deployment had a little better luck, but still, it gets stuck on and time outs:
```
  ....
  /_img/THIRST-HD1080p.mov 807/909 (1900000 bytes)
  /_img/THIRST-HD1080p.mov 808/909 (1900000 bytes)

The request timed out.
```
I have went through Topic about http2 here in forum and tried suggestions there, however no luck so far. Tried also redeploy multiple times and see that cycles are burned, but deploy never finished.
