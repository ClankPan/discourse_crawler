I hacked together this page to show more info on the on-chain ICP price. This fetches the latest ExchangeRate proposals from the governance canister.

Observations & Questions:
* As of right now, it seems like the price hasn't been updated in over 3 hours
* What is the methodology for determining price? Is it simply the highest volume exchange at that point in time?
* The update frequency is 5 minutes, which may not be fast enough during periods of high volatility (eg. Black Thursday)
* Is there documentation on the cycle minting canister? Seems like the `get_icp_xdr_conversion_rate` function would be the canonical price oracle that we want to integrate
