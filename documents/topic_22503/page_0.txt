A proposal of an NNS wallet supporting every type (EXT,DIP20,ICRC-1 etc) is urgent.

Then it will be very easy for an SNS launch and be community controled.

There are answers regarding your words:
1. BABY AROF has a good DAO right now
(Note, if the wallet has 3% of the token's liquidity, it can create a vote)

2. NNS still needs to be improved, if such a wallet is connected to NNS that can support DIP20 standard, we will definitely prioritize this

3. We have no desire to add a new standard to the white paper, so the BABY AROF token will not be created with a new standard.

Regarding this matter, we have considered many plans to link new projects to the BABY AROF token...
More projects to create the first liquidity pool under BABY AROF framework conditions to create the first liquidity pool with BABY AROF token.

New projects can purchase BABY AROF tokens after the fundraising stage and create their token liquidity pool.
