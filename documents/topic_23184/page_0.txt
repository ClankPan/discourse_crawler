I believe in this code I will need to encode my payload:

const createManageNeuronRequestForProposal = (neuronId, title, url, summary, function_id, payload) => {
        return {
            id: [{ NeuronId: neuronId }],
            command: [{
                MakeProposal: {
                    title: title,
                    url: url,
                    summary: summary,
                    action: {
                        ExecuteGenericNervousSystemFunction: {
                            function_id: function_id,
                            payload: payload
                        }
                    }
                }
            }],
            neuron_id_or_subaccount: [{ NeuronId: neuronId }] 
        };
    };

    const revaluePlayerUp = async (playerId, userPrincipal) => {
        const proposalTitle = "Execute generic function for player";
        const proposalUrl = "https://openfpl.xyz/governance";
        const proposalSummary = `Proposal to execute a generic function for player ${playerId}.`;

        const payload = encodePayload(`(${playerId})`); //need encode payload function

        const neurons = await listNeurons({ principal: userPrincipal });
        for (const neuron of neurons) {
            const neuronId = neuron.id[0].NeuronId.toString();
            const manageNeuronRequest = createManageNeuronRequestForProposal(neuronId, proposalTitle, proposalUrl, proposalSummary, 1000, payload);
            await SnsGovernanceCanister.manageNeuron(manageNeuronRequest);
        }
    };

Is there a built in function anywhere to encode the payload?

I think you're looking for something like IDL.encode: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/main/packages/candid/src/idl.test.ts#L11

Thank you Severin, appreciate it.

I just wanted to check the setup to be sure:

So it's import IDL

I'm encoding the payload arguments for a manageNeuronRequest. So I'm assuming I would put the governance canister Id as the InitArgs for the encoding:

Looks plausible to me, but I've never worked with JS before, so I think you just have to try it out
