Hello,

Has anyone compared ICP to TON network regarding computational capabilities? I saw that TON is able to process millions of transactions per second. Sounds amazing but I didn't found anything regarding MIEPs in order to compare the two meaningful.

Edit: it are not million transactions per second but per day. But in total there was a max. of 100000 transactions per second.


Greetings
