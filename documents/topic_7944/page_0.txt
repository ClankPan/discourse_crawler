============

I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. This is a new container. This problem still occurs frequently. This is a container used in production. I am very disappointed.

dfx canister --network ic uninstall-code m2kr7-waaaa-aaaah-aawoa-cai

dfx canister --network ic install m2kr7-waaaa-aaaah-aawoa-cai

should work.

I'm having the same issue. I tried running these lines you suggested and when I do, i get the following error: 

`Creating a wallet canister on the ic network.
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content: <html>

It's the reason : HeapMap too big ?

I got the same issue.
