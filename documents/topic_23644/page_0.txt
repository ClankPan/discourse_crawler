We're having some very interesting collaborations in the C++ Community on Open Chat, and I want to invite users of icpp-pro to also chime in on discussions regarding Enhancement proposals.

To make this possible, I created a dedicated channel:

[OC C++ Community: icpp-pro Enhancements channel](https://oc.app/community/cklkv-3aaaa-aaaar-ar7uq-cai/channel/236462292094214067696413884982053789248/?ref=6e3y2-4yaaa-aaaaf-araya-cai) 


I started a discussion there on the need to support 3rd party libraries, since it is becoming a common pattern that users are including them in their C++ projects.
