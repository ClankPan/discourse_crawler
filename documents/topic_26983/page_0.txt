I'm still working on getting the HTTP requests to work as mentioned in my [previous post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/failed-to-authenticate-request-due-to-the-user-id-does-not-match-the-public-key/26972?u=jesse).

I was able to resolve the issue I was having in that previous post, but there was another error awaiting. 
The current error is pertaining to the DER encoding yet again. this time, instead of getting complaints about the length of the public key, I'm getting the following:
```
Error: Error in DER encoding: Incomplete data or invalid ASN1
```

Has anyone encountered this error and if so, what might be the issue here?

It may still be your key encoding. Can you generate a test key and dump your encoded blob here?

I found the issue. For some reason, the Y coordinate of the decompressed key wasn't being properly concatenated to the DER encoding of the public key. Once I fixed that, the request was submitted successfully with a 202 status :clinking_glasses:

Finally!
