Hi Everyone! :grinning:

Welcome to Dfinity Discourse community. My name is Edmund and I have been a part of the community admin team at Dfinity since February 2018. 

In my hometown here in Vancouver I run [Crypto Vancouver](https://www.meetup.com/Crypto-Vancouver/), a meetup for blockchain/crypto enthusiasts to collaborate and share information with one another. 

I have always viewed Dfinity as such - a ambitious organization that seeks to address one of the largest risks of any digital business - that is the reliance and core dependancies on centralized cloud providers. 

Recently the team has shipped an alpha version of its SDK. Im excited to see the network materalize into something that will really change the way we look at cloud hosting.

Feel free to reach out and lets chat!
