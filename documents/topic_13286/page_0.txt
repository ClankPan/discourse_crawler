Step'n is a new m2e (move to earn) web3 app, currently running on Solana and recently on BSC. They just started accepting bids for its 4th realm and I think this presents a great opportunity for the Internet Computer.

Step'n really is a perfect way to onboard new users to crypto, help save the environment and improve health. And on a truly capable blockchain like the Internet Computer it would be a game changer.

Can somebody at Dfinity please have a look.

M2E feels like ponzi schemes to me.
