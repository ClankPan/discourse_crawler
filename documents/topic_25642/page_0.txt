I'm getting a strange problem with my local II. It's not showing the interface for authentication,  it's giving this short error in the browser.

I have multiple projects locally that all use II, they were all working fine with the local II, but I don't know if I changed anything or installed anything on my machine that may have caused this, because now they are all not working, I even created a new project and put the II in the frontend but still getting the same, even changed the browser as well.

This is how I'm trying to use it:

And it's aslo deploying well, what could be the problem? I am using dfx version 0.15.1.
Thank you.

Can you try to pin the II version?

```
{
  "canisters": {
    "internet_identity": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2023-11-17/internet_identity.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2023-11-17/internet_identity_dev.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
        }
      },
      "frontend": {}
    }
  }
}
```

i.e. `release-2023-11-17` instead of `latest`.

I had issue this week which was solved by pinning the version, maybe you are facing the same problem. Maybe not but, worth a try...

That was the fix :fire:, it's working now, thank you!

Great to hear!

cc @frederikrothenberger, it seems the issue I reported this week isn't tied to the dfx version, as OP here is using v0.15.1. As we discussed, I'll try to reproduce it at the beginning of next week.

@iamenochchirima: On Firefox or Chrome, please use the URL in the form of `http://<canisterId>.localhost:4943` instead of `http://localhost:4943?canisterId=<canisterId>`.

The reason is that the routing to find the canister based on the parameter is very unreliable. Transitive resources lose the request parameter and then cannot be routed correctly. We will update the development documentation accordingly.
