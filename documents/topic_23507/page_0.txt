I want before upgrading a canister programmatically (by `.install_code()` of the management canister) possibly ask the user yes/no to upgrade where the question would be asked if and only if `dfx deploy` asks this question in the same situation.

In other words, if in this upgrade `dfx deploy` would ask confirmation, I also want to ask confirmation. If it does not ask, I also don't want to ask.

The question should be the same as of `dfx deploy` (like: that function changed, old one is ..., new one is ...).

Also, how to upgrade the Candid interface of a canister programmatically (without using `dfx deploy`).

[Here's](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/dfx/src/lib/operations/canister/install_canister.rs#L265) how dfx determines if the interfaces are compatible. On CLI you can use `didc subtype`.

The candid interface is read form the `candid:service` custom section of the wasm. If you put the new candid file into the custom section it will be updated automatically
