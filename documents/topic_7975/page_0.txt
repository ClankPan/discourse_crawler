I'm getting this warning "Cannot propose block as the locally available validation context is smaller than the parent validation context", which I see from the dfx logs after running after dfx start. I think this is also causing calls to the canister to timeout? How do I fix this?

You may need to reset the replica chain state to fix this using dfx start --clean, or manually deleting the .dfx directory in your project.

Doesn't this mean I lose the local state? Ideally I want to keep my state and all the data.

Youâ€™d lose the local state yes. You could backup the .dfx directory before doing this though, and see if starting with a clean state recreates the problem when you install/populate canisters etc.

@Ori 
It fixes the issue, but eventually if I upload a lot of data again, the issue comes back, so it seems reproducible. Is there any way around this or is this just a limitation on local development?

Which dfx --version are you running? The latest is 0.8.3.

@Ori I believe I have been using 0.8.1
