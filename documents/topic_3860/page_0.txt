I'm stoked! I'd like to hear, what do you think? This could be a real game changer in the mobile OS space, and one that is very much required. One of the long term goals of my startup is a custom android OS, guess that would now change to a custom Endorphin OS, assuming it would be open source. Hope it will be! :crossed_fingers:

Full support! :metal:

I had a similar idea of running web/browser based apps on a mobile OS instead of relying traditional app stores. I'm glad Dfinity foundation are the ones working on this. So hyped.
