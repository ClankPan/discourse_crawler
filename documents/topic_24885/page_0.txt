**TLDR**: Proposal to add a buy ICP button to the NNS FE

## Motivation
* Increased governance participation on the Internet Computer is key to the success of the network, and its ecosystem.
* A step towards increasing governance participation is to remove barriers of entry for first-time users by allowing them to quickly experiment with staking, and interact with the Internet Computer’s governance system via the NNS dapp.
* ICP utility tokens are necessary for voting on proposals that upgrade the network.
* Currently, there is no way for users to acquire ICP through the NNS dapp.

## Suggested approach
* Introduce a “Buy ICP” button in the NNS dapp that would open up a list of fiat on-ramp service providers that users can choose from.
* Once selected, the user is taken to the service provider’s website to purchase ICP where their ICP account id is pre-filled.
* Once completing the purchase, the user will have ICP in their NNS wallet, that they can use to create neurons.
* DFINITY, or the NNS will **not** receive revenue from this integration.

## Next steps
* Initially, a single fiat on-ramp provider is to be implemented depending on the simplicity of integration to test the feature.
* Later on, more providers would be added in order to cover a wide range of fiat currencies and countries.

We welcome your feedback on this proposal and any suggestions on how to improve it.

Makes a lot of sense.
Actually, no company is going to deploy critical systems on ICP if experience is crypto-related.

We should run away from crypto-coin world and create a seamless experience as if I was working on AWS, where payment system is just a tokenized card that I input on day 1 and forget about it.

Please use coinbase, other providers can look shady

GREAT IDEA. I think this would help us onboard more users to our community

I love the idea, but I don't really understand the insistence on not receiving any revenue or fee from the transaction. All the other wallets and/or services that do this all charge a fee. I think a small fee would make sense. If the NNS doesn't want to receive revenue from that it could be allocated to a special treasury for future dApp development grants.

New NNS dapp upgrade proposal includes an initial version of the "Buy ICP" button using [Banxa](https://banxa.com/) as the first provider. Please consider voting!

I'm not sure if Coinbase uses fiat onramp integrations. Could you point me to a site that uses Coinbase as their onramp?

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/fiat-on-ramp-integration-in-the-nns-dapp/24885/5?u=chepreghy

I like the idea in principle, but I think it's a lot trickier in practice. I haven't heard onramp providers partnering with a DAO, where the DAO takes a cut. Or if it's another entity, who would control this special treasury, and who would decide what projects get grants?

But I am afraid that the use of *Coinbase Pay* supposes to have a Coinbase account, so that would spoil the 1-step process we want.

How can ICP team develope this in 2 days and take over a year to bring ckETH?

-------------------------

Mattyjay427 | 2023-11-24 18:51:58 UTC | #10

Are you being sarcastic? ckETH is a novel idea that is completely unique and has never been done before. Adding an existing fiat on ramp from a 3rd party that is already developed is a joke compared to ckETH... cmon now

-------------------------

Zane | 2023-11-24 19:35:04 UTC | #11

I'm not sure how this change will bring substantial improvements, the % of users who happen to know about the NNS and require an on ramp to get into the ecosystem is quite small I'd assume.
I'd rather have the team spend the time working on other QoL features, but since it seems to have already been worked on, my only concern are the possible legal ramifications of integrating an on ramp in the NNS.
With the US legal system seemingly gearing up to heavily crack down on cryptos, could this addition further substantiate the token being a security in a hypothetical SEC lawsuit?

Doesn’t Plug use Coinbase as a fiat on-ramp?

-------------------------

chepreghy | 2023-11-24 21:01:18 UTC | #13

Plug is using [Onramp Money](https://x.com/onrampmoney/status/1706262657039556939?s=20). As far as I know they don't yet work in Switzerland.

This looks awesome, thank you! Doesn't work for me in Switzerland, do you know if this is US-only for now?

Hey, is it possible to talk with Tether to bring USDT to ICP ecosystem (I mean ICRC-2 token)? If so, this would mean a lot I think.

-------------------------

88188ic | 2023-11-25 23:21:21 UTC | #18

There is a lot of difference. One is adding fiat onramp and the other is making two blockchains talk to each other. Monumental difference.

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-11-26 19:21:29 UTC | #19

So what do you think ? Would add Coinbase Pay to the NNS be soon feasible ? In addition to Banxa I mean. It would definitely give trust and increase volumes.

-------------------------

demali.icp | 2023-11-27 02:47:21 UTC | #20

I really like the motivation behind this, adding a "Buy ICP" button in the NNS front end would definitely help lower barriers for first-time users.

One suggestion I have is to build in a small fee that burns a portion of the ICP purchased through this integration. For example, 0.5–1% of the ICP could be burnt as a "convenience fee" for allowing users to purchase directly within the NNS app. This would capture some value for the protocol itself, while still keeping fees low for users. It's much better than the 0.5- 4.5% you will find on exchanges, and burning the tokens would permanently lock value into the Internet Computer by reducing the overall supply.

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-27 03:38:57 UTC | #21

Welcome to the community Demali!

This is certainly an interesting idea. I'd love to hear what others think of this as well.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-11-27 18:52:13 UTC | #22

The provider is already charging people 2% fee. That would be outrageous. 

Coinbase only charge 0.3%.

Roman | 2023-11-28 17:34:15 UTC | #23

Dear @chepreghy, dear @peterparker,

Currently, the feature "Buy ICP" is available only once authenticated in the NNS.

It would be much better to see this button within the token section even when people are not logged in. 

Because, in my opinion, the point is mostly to invite people to join the adventure by purchasing their first ICP, to give Internet Computer a try. But currently, we are presupposing some engagement from the buyer as, right now, only people already taking part to ICP can find this button, but most of us* (if not all of us) will NOT use this button. The idea should be to tell people "give it a try", rather than "for you who are already familiar with the ecosystem but don't want to use an exchange, use your credit card". 

In a few words : I think this button must also be thought as a ramp for ICP rather than just a fiat-on-ramp.

By consequence, we could think this button as inviting the newcomers to purchase some ICP *by creating an Internet Identity* before being finally able to make the acquisition.

*"us" meaning : people already engaged within ICP

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-11-28 13:39:05 UTC | #24

Well, thanks @Roman for tagging me but from a product perspective, I'll let Andrew answer because I don't have much to do with it and personally, I also voted against this feature.

That said, from a technical perspective, one limitation I can foresee and share is that presenting the "Buy ICP" button to users who are not signed in implies that the dapp cannot show to which address the ICP should be transferred.

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-11-28 13:49:00 UTC | #25

You are totally right @peterparker. Thank for your answer. So, we could think something like "Buy ICP" which would immediately invite people to log in or create an account. We just need to think about the best catchphrases.

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-11-29 22:54:26 UTC | #26

I suppose, you can daisy chain - "Please create an account to buy ICP!"

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-30 04:28:57 UTC | #27

I like that idea. I would take out the please though. it seems trivial but I feel like an enthusiastic "Create an Account to Buy ICP!" would work. The please sounds a little desperate.

-------------------------

chepreghy | 2023-11-30 09:08:05 UTC | #28

We could also just have the same "Buy ICP" button as now, but if you click it, it would bring you to Internet Identity right away to authenticate.

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-11-30 11:55:07 UTC | #29

But we would need to make the becoming buyer understand why they are seeing this redirection toward a creation of an II. WE know what an II is but we need to think as a brand newcomer. So maybe we could add some words to make them understand this redirection.

On the other hand (thinking against myself), when people are trying to buy some stuff on the Web2, they are often used to have to create an account when they click on "buy" ; so maybe they will understand by themselves why they see *this*. 

But on a third hand, "this" won't be just a "create an account", but "set up an Internet Identity"... It could make them abandon the process of acquisition, because of the newness of the concept (II). 

I don't know. We need to think about this. Maybe an intermediary disclaimer needs to be added between "Buy" and "Create your II", as 
– "To receive your ICP, you just need to create an account by creating an II". 
– Or "You'll receive your ICP on the account attached to your II (Click to create my II)".

We need the simplest and straightest phrase, but also the most intuitive one. We must think for a web 2 user. BUT the buyer needs to think that the creation of an II and the creation of their account are the same thing, to avoid making them think they are starting a multi steps process (and abandon).

Samples :

1. **Maybe this : "To receive your ICP, create your account just by creating an Internet Identity"**

1. Or maybe better :  **"To receive your ICP, create your** *receiving address* **just by creating an Internet Identity"**

It would look like this : Buy ICP > :point_up_2: > Internet Identity creating/authenticating process
But we also need to take in consideration people already having an II, by perfecting the examples above adding somewhere **"authenticate yourself"**

So :

3. **To receive your ICP, create your receiving address just by creating an Internet Identity**, *or authenticate yourself with your II if you already have one*"
Ultimately : Buy ICP > :point_up_2: > Internet Identity creating/authenticating process

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-11-30 17:02:29 UTC | #30

Yes, but it gets a bit more complicated to implement.  Ask the front end guys what they would be happy to do. :-)

-------------------------

osman | 2023-12-24 13:37:37 UTC | #31

As a service provider, the first priority is the DEXs (such as iclight, sonic) deployed on the ICP, and the second option is to offer the user a choice from the CEX list. binance global coinbase etc.

-------------------------

osman | 2023-12-24 13:44:26 UTC | #32

The main thing to do here is to ensure that ICP is purchased with fiat money in NNS dap. The natural thing would be to turn to platforms that allow ICP trading with fiat money. If the DEXs located on the ICP allow buying/selling ICP with fiat money, it is best to direct them to the dex platforms on the ICP.
