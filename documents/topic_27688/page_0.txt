[Products Details](https://docsend.com/view/gfggw7ag4zw44daz)

## **Features**

* **Custom Data Feeds**: Create tailored data streams for any dApp's unique requirements.
* **Modular and Compositional Approach**: Flexible integration of tools to suit diverse application needs.
* **Decentralized Authentication (DAuth)**: Streamline user verification across platforms with verifiable credentials.
* **On-chain Preprocessing**: Apply data preprocessing before delivering your data to smart contract.
* **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Facilitate seamless data exchange and interoperability across blockchains.
* **Embedded Randomness**: Generate tamper-proof random numbers for dApps, enhancing fairness and security.
* **ICP Integration**: Utilizes Internet Computer's advanced features like HTTP Outcalls, ECDSA threshold signatures, the heartbeat system, and the SIWE approach to authenticate users. 

## **Usage Example**

```
// Simple Raffle example of utilization randomness from automation tool Pythia
import {OrallyPythiaConsumer} from "../consumers/OrallyPythiaConsumer.sol";

contract RaffleExample is OrallyPythiaConsumer {
    uint256 maxNumberOfTickets;
    uint256 ticketPrice;
    address[] entries;

    constructor(
        address _pythiaRegistry,
        uint256 _maxNumberOfTickets,
        uint256 _ticketPrice
    ) OrallyPythiaConsumer(_pythiaRegistry) {
        maxNumberOfTickets = _maxNumberOfTickets;
        ticketPrice = _ticketPrice;
    }

    function enterRaffle() external payable {
        require(
            entries.length < maxNumberOfTickets,
            "RaffleExample: Raffle is full"
        );
        require(
            msg.value == ticketPrice,
            "RaffleExample: Ticket price is not correct"
        );
        entries.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function pickWinner(uint256 _randomNumber) external onlyExecutor {
        require(
            entries.length == maxNumberOfTickets,
            "RaffleExample: Raffle is not full"
        );
        uint256 winnerIndex = _randomNumber % entries.length;
        payable(entries[winnerIndex]).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    }
}
```

```
// Sample code to request data from Orally's Apollo service
import {OrallyApolloConsumer} from "../consumers/OrallyApolloConsumer.sol";
import {IApolloCoordinator} from "../interfaces/IApolloCoordinator.sol";

contract ApolloConsumerExample is OrallyApolloConsumer {
    uint256 public rate;
    uint256 public decimals;
    uint256 public timestamp;
    IApolloCoordinator public apollo;

    constructor(address _executorsRegistry, address _apolloCoordinator) OrallyApolloConsumer(_executorsRegistry) {
      apollo = IApolloCoordinator(_apolloCoordinator);
    }

    function requestValue() {
       apollo.requestDataFeed("ICP/USD", 300000);
    }

    function fulfillDataFeed(string memory, uint256 _rate, uint256 _decimals, uint256 _timestamp) external onlyExecutor {
        rate = _rate;
        decimals = _decimals;
        timestamp = _timestamp;
    }
}
```

## **Future Plans**

Looking forward, Orally Network aims to expand its suite with more innovative tools, enhance cross-chain capabilities, and foster a vibrant developer community. We're also exploring partnerships, and attending blockchain conferences. 

#### Weather Prediction

![weather-prediction|598x499](upload://hlW6H9xVkFPUDiybT4UT28eHUtK.png)


Our recent participation in [Dfinity's Global R&D](https://youtu.be/4JDbzfDax9Q?si=_o10ddNPOZovQtCL&t=3060) event was a landmark moment for Orally Network, where we demonstrated a dynamic showcase of our capabilities with a weather prediction model. Utilizing our Sybil and Pythia tools, we've successfully automated the delivery of custom data feeds to a smart contract on Arbitrum, enabling accurate weather predictions and winner determinations. 

Watch our showcase demo here: 
https://youtu.be/1vyjpcNhw5k?si=lYvf9q76cHD6-4Qh

Building on this momentum, our immediate focus is on enriching our showcase product line. We're expanding the prediction platform to encompass a broader spectrum of predictions (BTC price, randomness, US election), across various timeframes and blockchain networks (BSC, Base, zkSync, Scroll), offering unparalleled versatility and utility in predictive analytics on the blockchain.

#### Non-custodial DCA

In parallel, we're excited to announce our upcoming product launch: a non-custodial Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) tool. This innovation will empower users to execute one of the safest investment strategies directly from their non-custodial wallets, following gasless, permissionless approaches. Our design team is putting the finishing touches on this product, ensuring it combines functionality with a seamless user experience. Stay tuned for more details on this groundbreaking tool and other future developments from Orally Network.
