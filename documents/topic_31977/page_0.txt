I swapped ROS for 55 ICP today. Transaction is logged in my PIP...The ICP haven't been sent to my account and my ROS was deducted from the ICPWALLET.  I trust ICPSWAP team will reply as I have contacted the ICPSWAP team 6 hours ago at contact@icpswap.org   still awaiting acknowledgement of my email & contact inquiry via Open Chat et al

Please keep us informed as my reclaim is NOT reclaiming and I swapped on ICPSWAP to received 55 ICP tokens that are still NOT in my account nor reclaimed BUT in my transaction's itemization. Nearing 24hours without a corrective measure in place is very disturbing and starting to make me very uncomfortable going forward.

@icpswap please let us know if it was user error because I'm beginning to think he might be confused about how ICPswap works

not confused @CkICP . I am very knowledgeable about ICP, the ecosystem and its capabilities. And yes, I also would love to hear from @ICPSwap the details of the error and corrective measures taken @CkICP - NOTCONFUSED

Thank you for waiting. After the team‚Äôs expedited checking and processing, here is a quick update:

The vast majority of tokens that were stuck in the pools have been processed. You can reclaim your tokens here: [ICPSwap](https://app.icpswap.com/swap/reclaim)

Currently, only transactions in the ckUSDC/ICP pool still need further checking and verification, and they will be completed ASAP.

Thank you so much for your patience and support!

Good communication works both ways.  We as a community can not jump to the worst conclusions whenever there is a problem, like "I'm not seeing my .55 USDC on ICPswap, therefore ICP is unreliable".  That's clearly an emotional overreaction because the issue was resolved within a day.  ICP being unreliable or calling it "Solana part 2" is uncalled for.  Just say you lost your tokens during a transaction.... please Mr.ICPswap fix it for me,... and wait.

Hello sirs. @CkICP @FredD 

June 15, 2024, the NNS subnet experienced performance issues, causing the ICP ledger to run slow down. You can think of it like a computer not getting enough power, so the CPU couldn't handle many tasks.

Most transactions on ICPSwap rely on ICP, and the run slow down of the ICP ledger meant that while some transactions could proceed normally, most couldn't, leaving tokens stuck in the pools.

The ICPSwap team investigated the issue, verified the data, and submitted a proposal to add an admin to handle deposit and withdrawal errors in the pools and return the stuck tokens to users.

As of now, all issues have been resolved.

Is this what you wanted to know?

CkICP | 2024-06-16 10:30:34 UTC | #13

That's good enough for me.  Your explanation is exactly the type of info. that people would want to know.

I also apologize to you and your team for any rude comments you encountered from some here.  I hope my reply was quick enough for you...would hate to have to explain why I took so long to reply back to your good explanation! üôÇ (Just poking fun at @FredD)üôÇ

Thank you for the explanation. This is exactly the kind of detail I was seeking.

I agree. I think some folks really over reacted.
