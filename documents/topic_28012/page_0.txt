Hello folks

After many discussions on X and other platforms,  ICP has a big inflation and needs to be controlled. 
We need a burning system for ICP to control inflation.

So we know that by Cycles ICP will burn but the rate is not enough.
Reward of node and stacking reward are the most effective of inflation. 
ICP needs more functions for burning like fees to burning (like Ethereum)
Or the reward should be lower or the foundation should buy back and burn it like what BNB has done!

What do you think?
What is the best option for inflation?

We can also use burning mechanism like Polkadot
