I want to return different data type depending on the input to a function.
Example:

func get(n: Int): __ {
if (n ==0) {
  return 100;
}
else {
return "Test String";
}
}

What type should we fill in the bracket?
Is there a way to mention the return type can be either Nat or Text or someotherthing

Thanks

There's an `or` type operator, but it would return the supertype, which in your case is `Any` I believe.

I don't think there's a way to specifically return a `Nat` or `Text`.. I may be wrong...

Your function could return a tagged variant: [https://smartcontracts.org/docs/candid-guide/candid-types.html#type-variant](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/candid-guide/candid-types.html#type-variant)
See ‚ÄúCorresponding Motoko type‚Äù further down the page for an example.

Ah yeah, this is the right approach. Can't believe I forgot about that.

For the viewers at home üôÇ

```
func get(n : Int) : { #nat : Nat; #text : Text; } {
  if (n == 0) {
    return #nat 100;
  } else {
    return #text "Test String";
  }
};
```
