I tried to upgrade from 0.6.26 to 0.7 with `dfx upgrade` but ran into this error message:

>Current version: 0.6.26
Fetching manifest https://sdk.dfinity.org/manifest.json
Invalid data: unable to fetch manifest: Forbidden

Can someone help?

This worked for me.

    DFX_VERSION=0.7.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

Found out where the issue was. I was trying to upgrade dfx in a subfolder path. When I returned to the parent folder and ran `dfx upgrade` again, it worked out just fine.
