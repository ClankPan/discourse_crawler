**Q:** Is this an error or a bad usage? Thanks.

$ dfx --version
dfx 0.7.0

# # create a new identity named "test"
$ dfx identity new test
Creating identity: "test".
Created identity: "test".

# # attempt to create a new identity named "test2" from the "test" identity pem file
$ dfx identity import test2 ~/.config/dfx/identity/test/identity.pem 
Creating identity: "test2".
Cannot decode PEM file at '/home/jron/.config/dfx/identity/test/identity.pem'.

The example you describe isn't quite the intended use case (maybe it should be supported).
The main use case scenario for the `dfx identity import` command is the capability to import a PEM file that you generated from somewhere else (for example, an `identity.pem` file generated by the `keysmith` tool) to create an identity recognized by `dfx` rather than the ability to import a PEM file from one `dfx` identity to use with another `dfx` identity. 

HTH
I think the `import` command might support a different encoding scheme than what the `dfx identity new` command generates.

Thanks. Yes, it would be nice if supported.
