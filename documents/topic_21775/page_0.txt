I can't seem to find those. Does anyone have a link?

The ckBTC ledger is nothing less than an Icrc ledger.

Got it. Thanks!

Also noticed that the dashboard does not show the interface: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai
Is that intentionally not embedded in the wasm?

Ummm I get the Candid Interface when I open your link to the dashboard 🤷‍♂️
