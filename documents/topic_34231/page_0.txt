I've seen this a few times, but more often lately.  https://gnyp4-fiaaa-aaaag-qddxq-cai.app.ic0.app/ is giving me a nasty https error:

Sometimes when I refresh it will go away.

I get similar things when I try to go through the custom domain(admittedly I may have something set up wrong:

https://icdevs.org/

But

https://www.icdevs.org/ seems to work just fine.

I went into my settings and some things looked fishy so I made sure I had the .well-known folder and that my DNS looked right and registered www and root. Everything is fine now, but it was also fine for weeks and just stopped being fine.

I'm just curious if something changed on the boundary nodes that would have made the https stop working?

Cannot answer your question about the BN but, I guess it's related to `ic0.app`. I am under the impression that this domain should no longer be used and was replaced by `icp0.io` following the incident in February 2023 ([thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/follow-up-on-item-new-canisters-will-only-be-accessible-through-the-icp0-io-domain-existing-canisters-will-be-accessible-both-through-ic0-app-and-icp0-io/18889)). If you use the latter, do you encounter the same issue?

Hi @skilesare 

I am not aware of anything happening. It would be super useful for us to get the IP address of the boundary node you were connecting to in case you still have that information (and otherwise for the future).

It could be that one BN was bad (e.g., didn't have the certificates). In that case, you would make a DNS lookup whenever you access a site. It could have then chosen the bad one for `gnyp4....ic0.app` and for `icdevs.org`, but not for `www.icdevs.org`.
