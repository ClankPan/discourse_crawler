Hello everyone, I would like to tell something that is happening specifically in an Internet computer project, SONIC: one of the sections of the protocol is the LBP, where new developers present their new project to obtain liquidity, well, one of the latest projects is CKHEDGE and it has all the appearance of being a scam, its first investors have had large losses, they respond when they want and only with promises, SONIC does not want to know anything about it but CKHEDGE is still active on the exchange.
 My interest here is solely for the good development of the community and that is why many questions arise. If this in the end turns out to be a fraud, I see that it is an easy entry point for scammers. Investors must be aware of our responsibility to When it comes to investing, SONIC must be more responsible towards its investors, this is currently happening and you can see it and ask questions within OPENCHAT CKHEDGE, I wanted to launch it to the community and listen to ideas, thank you
