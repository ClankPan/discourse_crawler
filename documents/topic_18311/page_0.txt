Hello,

Concerning service-worker I should update one of my canister.

I restart from the documentation [Creating the custom Service Worker](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/deploy/custom-domain/#creating-the-custom-service-worker) and update repo from github [dfinity/ic](https://github.com/dfinity/ic) 

My problem is that the documentation (31 Jan 2023) is what I had done. On the other hand the content of the repo. gihub and its readme are not aligned there is also a didc command that I do not know and that seems to be a tool but it does not come with dfx. 
What is the status?

Thanks

Hello @rbolog, sorry that you've had this issue with the documentation. I'll update this. In the meantime, the mapping that you need to update has moved from `service-worker/src/sw/http_request.ts` to `service-worker/src/sw/domains/static.ts`.

You don't need to worry about the `didc` command, this is documentation needed for developers who are actively working on the service worker. You only need to update the mapping in `static` and build the service worker with `npm run build`.

Nathan's PR to update the docs was just merged. It will be up to date in a few minutes.
