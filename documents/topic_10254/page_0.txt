Creating UI canister on the ic_pro network.
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content: <html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.21.3</center>
</body>
</html>
```
when i deploy canister on a special network like below:
```
"ic_pro": {
    "providers": ["https://ic0.app"],
    "type": "persistent"
  }
```

All canisters had been created, but get the http error when installing the canister code

Likely you don't have a wallet set for the combination of identity and network. Also, there's a bunch of better error messages in the latest version of dfx if you fancy upgrading...

Do you have a wallet configured for this identity on the network `ic`? Also, what version of dfx are you running?
