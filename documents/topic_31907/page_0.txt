As the title of the proposal states, wanted to know if there's any progress with on chain encryption.


Also want to know what happened to Post Quantum Cryptography, which was published in DFINITY's roadmap a few years ago.


I did see someone using Google Forms for onboarding devs to this feature somewhere, can't remember it. Seems centralized.

As per my understanding DFINITY also stores backup of replica states in Zurich(?). Seems centralized and is a breach of privacy. DFINITY also has access to private data of Internet Identity, no?

Any update on this @diegop @ais @Jan ?

Okay so DFINITY finished developing this feature a year ago and still won't release it because they're afraid of lawsuits? very decentralized, lol.

Can we ban this guy forever? He's intolerable. @diegop

I would like to know the status and reason behind withholding of this feature too.

Nothing is being withheld. The research was published once it was ready for publication. Since then the developer preview was created and released. What is still missing is the production-ready implementation to the ICP protocol. It is a simple matter of prioritization. E.g. tSchnorr was put in ahead of vetKeys because it includes a lot of the building blocks needed for vetKeys. As you can see on the [roadmap](https://internetcomputer.org/roadmap#Privacy-start), vetKeys will be worked on very soon.

Please continue any discussion in the [main thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-key-derivation-privacy-on-the-ic/16560)
