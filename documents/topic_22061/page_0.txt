I have a rust ICP backend and it seams very slow. However, using fleek my speed it up. And dynamically create canisters for each user (just like openChat) in order to reduce the load on each canister and distribute it on multi canisters. So, are these good solutions? is there a better way to speed up my backend?

By far the slowest operations is making inter-canister calls (`await`s). If you can skip some you'll save much more than with anything else
