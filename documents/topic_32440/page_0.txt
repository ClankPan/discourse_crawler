I have 30 plus years of experience in medical device sales and service. I am looking for developers to partner in the development of an application that will fundamentally record the chain of ownership of high value, high liability medical equipment. This application would streamline FDA recalls, provide transaction security for used equipment sales, provide risk management and alert device theft.  The used medical industry is a 40 billion dollar world-wide market and this application would be used to provide transaction security for sales, particularly international, by eliminating the  fees, delays and exchange rates of international banking.  There are many features of ICP, such as internet identity that are suited for this project.
