Hey guys

I initially tested with sns-testing using the sns_ini.yaml configuration, which worked well. However, when attempting to use the sns tool to submit a proposal and update my local sns repository using `bazel build //rs/sns/cli:sns`  it failed, even with my bazelisk wrapper (I'm on Ubuntu).

As an alternative, I explored the dfx extension for sns cli. But using this tool revealed issues when running `dfx sns config validate` due to differences in the sns configuration file required. The `dfx sns config new` command generated a sns.yml file, distinct from the sns_ini.yaml in the sns-testing repo provided in the official documentation for submitting sns to nns. The new file is not only different but lacked essential information, such as minimal participants.

In summary, `dfx sns config new` produces a different sns.yml file compared to sns_ini.yaml from sns-testing in the official documentation. 

Which method should we actually use? Could you please guide me on the recommended method or direct me to a repository that has successfully implemented this process? I've found repositories from Open Chat and Nuance, but they use different config files, so I am not sure which one is the most recent one and which one we should use.

Thanks!

Hi @Francis,

The SNS CLI tool is currently in transition to a better format from an old format (which is still the one generated by the tool's `new` subcommand). Since you're using sns-testing, we just merged a PR that brings the SNS configuration file template there up to speed: https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/example_sns_init.yaml

Please refer to this one, and let me know if you have any further questions regarding the format.

> using `bazel build //rs/sns/cli:sns` it failed

Could you post the errors you were getting while trying to build SNS CLI via the `bazel` command, please?

Thanks @aterga - we will try this out and let you know what issues we run into (if any)
