### TL;DR

* Last year the NNS approved a motion [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970) for financial proposal spam prevention.
* This is planned to be released in March ‘23.

### Background

* A [new exchange rate](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/1) mechanism is planned to go live in Q1’23. It will automate the setting of the ICP/XDR exchange rate, which is currently set by an exchange rate proposal every 10 minutes. This exchange rate is used for converting ICP to cycles.
* The new exchange rate mechanism considerably increases the financial incentives for proposal spamming as it reduces the number of NNS proposals, in particular on week-ends. See the analysis [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/29).
* Hence, it was deemed desirable to implement a spam prevention mechanism in parallel with the new exchange rate mechanism.
* An according spam prevention [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970) by the community was adopted in September '22. After the SNS launch, the NNS engineering team has now picked up the work on this item from the roadmap.

### Scope of the spam prevention proposal

Adjusting the reward allocation scheme

* Currently, a neuron which votes on all proposals on a given day will receive the pro-rata share in terms of used NNS voting power on a given day of the total daily available rewards.
* After this change, a neuron which votes on all proposals on a given day will receive the pro-rata share in terms of total NNS voting power of the total daily available rewards.
* This amount is identical to the amount received under the current mechanism, in case that all neurons voted on all proposals on a given day.

Weight for governance proposals

* The proposal allows to move the governance weight back to 20 without incentivising spam. This change is also part of the proposal.

Tracking

* On each day, the total amount of available voting rewards and the actual distributed amount of voting rewards will be exposed as a governance metric.

### Implementation update

* The actual code change for the main element of this proposal is small, as explained [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/52).
* The outstanding implementation work focuses on testing & integration. Post SNS launch, the NNS engineering team has picked up this work again.
* The implementation is planned to be released in the next few weeks.

### Impact on voting rewards and inflation

Voting neurons will receive rewards aligned with the reward estimator on the IC [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance), which assumes that all neurons vote on everything.

Impact on voting neurons compared to current mechanism

* Compared to the current mechanism the impact will be very small for voting neurons.
* On a day without governance proposals, a neuron will receive almost the same amount of rewards as now. Rewards will be lower by a relative amount of 0.6% (e.g. instead of receiving 10 maturity a neuron would receive 9.94 maturity).
* On a day with one governance proposal in addition to an average of 6 further proposals (e.g. replica upgrades), neuron rewards will be lower by a relative amount of approximately 6% (e.g. instead of receiving 10 maturity a neuron would receive 9.4 maturity).

Impact on overall voting rewards post go-live

* Assuming that one governance proposal is submitted every 5 days and 50% participation in governance voting, we estimate that the overall amount of distributed voting rewards will be 80% of the total available voting rewards.
* This reduction is driven by non-voting neurons.

### Out of scope

After the approval of the spam prevention [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970), a subsequent discussion in the community focused on the creation of an NNS treasury, which did not find a consensus. Hence, we would like to clarify that this implementation update does not include any aspects of the NNS treasury.

Hi all, 
for completeness I would like to confirm that the above has been released last week on Wednesday.
