OpenChat is preparing to launch its SNS DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale expected soon.

This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the OpenChat SNS and ask the founding dev team any questions.

Here are links to the [proposal summary](https://github.com/open-ic/open-chat/blob/master/sns/config/sns_proposal_summary.md) and the [OpenChat SNS Whitepaper](https://oc.app/#/whitepaper). If possible read these documents before asking questions as hopefully they will already contain many of the answers.

We have received feedback that the minimum number of decentralization sale participants configured was too low and have increased this from 100 to 500. Hopefully this will alleviate concerns the sale wouldn't be sufficiently decentralized. If we make this too high we risk the sale failing and having to start again with different parameters. 

Likewise there is a concern that a max participation of 150,000 ICP per principal is too high and we have reduced this to 100,000. 

We are excited to launch the first SNS after the SNS-1 trial and by what lies ahead for OpenChat and the IC!

I cannot understand how can this be called decentralized sale when simultaneously is available to whales and retails buying chat tokens.
Obviously there is no way the sale ends in more than 1 minute.
So the target of 1million icp is reachable for sure.
So the fact that you insist on letting at the same time neurons with 10 or 50 icp and whale neurons, it is more than clear to me that your intentions is to be bought by certain wallets.
This is a private sale in a public sale.
If you want decentralization, then split the public sale in tiers
E.g 1st tier max 100icp
2nd tier max 1000icp
3rd tier max 10000icp
4th tier max 100000icp

I logged in to nns.ic0.app page with ii and checked “vote on proposals” tab and “108634” proposal not shows “adopt” / “rejects” buttons while other proposals shows these buttons. Checked from followed neurons but OpenChat’s neuron not available for following

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-02-22 11:08:09 UTC | #11

Did your neuron(s) vote automatically because they follow other neurons? If you look at the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/108634) you can see that a solid amount of known neurons already voted

-------------------------

dogan | 2023-02-22 11:12:47 UTC | #12

Really? Why my followed neurons auto vote instead of me? Hmm, actually not logical that. A way to prevent auto voting?

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-02-22 11:16:58 UTC | #13

Neurons automatically vote if an absolute majority of their followed neurons vote the same way. To edit you following settings you can use the instructions in [this wiki article](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Editing_following_for_neurons).

I think the team should vigorously popularize the concept of IC network ii identity manager before SNS. Most new users are confused about IC because they have no concept of ii, so they always confuse wallet (nns governance), OC, SWAP, etc., they are very confused why they have to use one wallet to log in to their many different dapps, and at the same time it brings more confusion about the appearance of new wallets for more dapps, but in fact because they neglect to understand the ii identity manager in the middle is the most important key components. This is the most secure key part of the IC network.

After understanding these, it will help new users to accept ICP and use OC. OC is a very good product. I predict that it will be sold out within 3 hours. In the future, 1 chat may be worth 1 ICP. I hope there will be no giant whales by then grab my CHAT purchase at once.

So will the price of chat token be different among the community fund and decentralization sell buyers ??? Because I don't understand that 0.2 to 0.4 icp price u put in your whitepaper

"Adoption of the proposal will enable and mandate DFINITY to install the required SNS canisters on the SNS subnet." Is this a necessary step? In other words, is Dfinity a necessary intermediary in the process of installing SNS canisters, or could OpenChat have done it independently? Do all decentralization sales have to go through a centralized intermediary?
Secondly, how can an NNS vote 'mandate' or force Dfinity to do anything? The NNS does not control Dfinity, does it? So, it is just that you have used the term 'mandate' when it actually a request which we know Dfinity will accede to?

-------------------------

megrogan | 2023-02-22 22:03:58 UTC | #21

It would be great if we could run a decentralization sale with 2 or more tiers as you suggest but this is not currently supported by the SNS and is out of our control.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-22 22:04:11 UTC | #22

Hey! I am one of the OpenChat devs.

The tiered setup you suggest would be great if we could do it! But unfortunately we can't...

This is the first version of the SNS decentralisation sale (excluding the SNS1 test sale), and currently the options are very minimal.

The SNS sale options will grow and mature over time, but we can't sit around and wait for it to be perfect before we launch, so we are going to launch and use the configuration options that are available to us right now.

Every configuration option we have selected can be disputed and there are pros and cons to raising or lowering each one.

Realistically, we think it is likely there may be 1 or 2 whales who decide to invest the maximum, and then the vast majority of people will invest smaller amounts. If we set the maximum amount a person can invest too low, it makes it much more unlikely that we hit our target of 1M ICP. We feel that the maximum of 100k reaches a good balance.

Additionally, by setting the minimum number of participants to 500, we ensure that the service is suitably decentralised. If the sale is snapped up by only a handful of whales, the sale will be invalidated and everyone will get refunded.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-22 22:06:16 UTC | #23

No, everyone gets the same price, but this can vary depending on how much we end up raising.

-------------------------

megrogan | 2023-02-22 22:29:17 UTC | #24

ScholarGuy | 2023-02-22 22:53:03 UTC | #25

Great development. We hope the best for OpenChat and the IC Blockchain.

-------------------------

icme | 2023-02-23 00:41:16 UTC | #26

Question regarding the OpenChat investor/team allocations.

Is there a locked vesting schedule? How much of the tokens will become accessible (sellable vs. locked, dissolving) after the launch.

Also curious on behalf of my own interests of launching an SNS project in the future!

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-02-23 03:36:35 UTC | #27


Thanks. It answers one question, which is that Dfinity has decided not to allow anybody else to install SNS canisters. The second one remains open: how does one 'mandate' Dfinity to do anything through an NNS vote? 
This seems one more instance of what happens in governance proposals. We hope and pray Dfinity will agree to do what the community has proposed. It usually does, but only because no vote can get through if Dfinity is opposed. I know it can happen theoretically, but I don't recall any actual instance where Dfinity voted against a proposal and it passed. 
That is not actually 'liquid democracy' or any kind of democracy. And then people get upset when the crypto community calls the IC centralised...

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2023-02-23 05:13:49 UTC | #28

So set it to 400icp max per anchor.
This is something like buying 10,000 chat tokens (approximately 0.002% of the 500million total initial supply).
100k icp can buy 2.5million chat tokens which about 0.5% of the 500 million initial supply.
This is not decentralization.
This is allowed to happen only when the openchat team knows that big centralized exchanges are about to buy the chat token.
It is a prearranged sale with no other option left to the team by the cexes.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-23 08:28:46 UTC | #29

Shortly, the end to end process of launching an SNS will be handled by a single NNS proposal.

But that functionality isn't ready yet so the path to launch the OpenChat SNS is slightly different and has to involve a manual call being made by a Dfinity controlled principal to the SNS-Wasm canister.

Dfinity made the decision to give the SNS launch the green light now rather than wait for the 'single proposal' version to be complete since that would mean delaying again.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-26 22:12:14 UTC | #30

The neuron configuration is defined here - https://github.com/open-ic/open-chat/blob/master/sns/config/sns.yml#L233

Each of the 3 devs will receive 5% of the total CHAT supply which will be locked into 5 neurons which vest over 4 years.

They each have a dissolve delay of 1 month but have vesting periods of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Having a vesting period on a neuron is a new feature on neurons. A neuron which hasn't vested yet can be used to vote but cannot be modified in any way.

By doing it this way we minimise the developer neurons' voting power (1 month is the minimum required to vote in OpenChat), while also giving confidence to the community that the devs are sticking around for the long term.

Each dev also has an additional tiny neuron (4 CHAT, which is the minimum stake allowed) with 12 month dissolve delay which is the one they'll use for voting.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-23 10:07:26 UTC | #31

If we set the max to 400 ICP we would have almost no chance of raising enough funds.

We have made no prearranged deals with anyone and we know of no individuals or groups who will be investing the maximum amount.

We haven't spoken to any centralised exchanges either. CHAT can't even be listed on centralised exchanges yet because 'rosetta' (which is how exchanges communicate with ledgers) hasn't been implemented for the SNS ledger.

So I am fairly certain that no centralised exchanges will want to buy up any CHAT.

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2023-02-23 10:53:35 UTC | #32

May I ask if this 'rosetta' is part of the roadmap? Is there any time plan? Because it is a kind of belief for many investors that CHAT will be able to go to Binance or Coinbase.

-------------------------

nlh | 2023-02-23 10:59:56 UTC | #33

Hi everyone.
First of all, congrats to the Open Chat team and my best wishes to your upcoming SNS sale.
I think I understand the basic configurations and requirements of the sale.
I would like to also have a question if you don't mind:
How Open Chat will compete with "free-of-charge" apps such as iMessage, messenger, etc. in the market, especially in terms of financial sustainability and mass adoption? And what is the business case of the CHAT token (beside the governance thing)? Many thanks.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-23 11:02:31 UTC | #34

Yes it is. Eventually SNS tokens will be tradable on centralised exchanges.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-23 11:07:25 UTC | #35

OpenChat is also free of charge!

Users can pay for additional benefits but the app is still fully functional without paying anything.

Many chat apps use a similar model, for example Telegram is free to use, but 'Telegram Premium' is $5 per month.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2023-02-23 11:49:36 UTC | #36

So what you say is that there is a disbelief about the cap target.
On the other hand whitepaper seems pretty sure of possible mitigation 51% and how to avoid it.

-------------------------

timo | 2023-02-23 12:13:50 UTC | #37

What will the raised funds be used for and how?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-23 15:18:07 UTC | #38

The funds raised will be used to cover all costs incurred by OpenChat.

Funds can only be moved from the treasury by proposal.

We have a canister called the 'CyclesDispenser' which is in charge of topping up all of our top level canisters, and whenever it runs low on cycles it burns ICP from an account it controls into cycles. So every so often we will need to make a proposal to send ICP to its ledger account.

The salaries of the dev team will also need to be paid out of the treasury by proposal.

Currently there are only 3 of us in the team but having a large amount of funds in the treasury opens up the opportunity to grow the team and give good bounties out to contributors.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-02-23 18:37:49 UTC | #39

It seems to me the whole launch is less of a sale (since all the funding is gathered in a treasury) and more like offering others to join a boardroom in which the future of OC and it's treasury will be determined. If that analogy is ok - How will the boardroom members communicate? Anything besides proposals?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-23 19:04:51 UTC | #40

Yeah that's a good analogy!

We'd communicate within OpenChat! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

We'll create some groups for discussing the direction of OpenChat.

-------------------------

ICPmy | 2023-02-24 02:17:05 UTC | #41

Yes this. Sns1 sales swept by bots. Dont let chat experience the same things

-------------------------

ICPmy | 2023-02-24 02:17:59 UTC | #42

Gated chatroom. Great analogy

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2023-02-24 03:52:56 UTC | #43

I hope this SNS public sale will be sold out within three or four hours. Therefore, I hope that the OC official team will issue a detailed SNS operation instruction, and the entire community will RT and forward this instruction on social media. Such an excellent product as OC should go out of ICP, so that other blockchain believers, BTC ETH DOGE all holders can also use it, and even let web2 Users can also use it.

This is very necessary. The community hopes CHAT to the moon and hope that OC will become more and more valuable. The community should unite to encourage more holders

-------------------------

Mitch | 2023-02-26 18:01:31 UTC | #44

Congrats to the team :partying_face: I hope I am able to participate, I wasn't so lucky with SNS-1.

How does the sale begin? Does the sale begin immediately once the majority vote is reached or will the voting conclude and a date will be chosen/announced for the sale?

-------------------------

Tromix | 2023-02-26 20:33:14 UTC | #45

This is going to be a whale orgy disguised as a DAO sale.

Congrats in advance to Dfinity. Truly a big round of applause. You have 2 SNS sales that went headfirst into the toilet.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-26 22:23:37 UTC | #46

What makes you think it will be a whale orgy?
If fewer than 500 people take part the sale will be invalid and everyone will get refunded.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-02-27 00:39:28 UTC | #47

If you want to be sure of participating in the "Open Chat" sale, all you have to do is activate "Community Fund Membership" on your neurons. In this way, you will invest about 10% of the neuron's maturity in an completely automated way.

Decentralized sale begin 82128 seconds once the majority vote is reached.

-------------------------

lara | 2023-02-27 11:22:22 UTC | #49

> Dfinity has decided not to allow anybody else to install SNS canisters

I would like to clarify that technically DFINITY does not have special privileges wrt installing SNS canisters.
An NNS proposal was required to add DFINITY's principal to a privileged list so that DFINITY could help with these steps *exactly once*. It was up to the NNS to accept this and someone else's principal could be added to this list and allowed to do so in the same way. 
Whether the NNS community (and DFINITY) would vote yes for this is a separate question, but I don't think this was categorically excluded.

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-02-27 15:01:17 UTC | #50

With respect to special privileges, here's @hpeebles : "Dfinity made the decision to give the SNS launch the green light now rather than wait for the ‘single proposal’ version to be complete since that would mean delaying again." 
I love a lot of stuff Dfinity is doing, and am rooting for Open Chat, but Dfinity does seem to have a bit of a blind spot regarding the gap between the de facto state of the network (the practical situation) and the de jure one (what is 'technically' the case). Anyway, I'm glad to hear this is a one-off deviation.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-02-27 17:43:36 UTC | #51

@hpeebles Is there a central location where I can find the following stats pertaining to the OpenChat app:

* financial information such as its revenue, balance sheet, expenditures (both developer and costs to keep the app running)
* financial projections (revenue, costs required to sustain the developer team/app)
* current users, daily active users, monthly active users, MoM user growth

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2023-02-28 14:15:43 UTC | #52

OpenChat has up until this point been funded by Dfinity (both the cost of the dev team and the cost of running the canisters).

So OpenChat itself doesn't really have a balance sheet, it simply has a pool of cycles, and whenever that cycles balance has needed topping up we would ask Dfinity for some more.

For the last few months the service has cost roughly 1500T cycles / month. The vast majority of that isn't actually burned and is still sitting in our canisters. This is because each canister needs its own pool of cycles in order to keep running. We've been in talks with Dfinity and in the not too distant future we're hoping that the cycles costs for a group of canister will be able to be paid by a single canister, this will reduce our upfront costs massively because we will no longer need to keep a pool of cycles in every canister.

Regarding revenue, we introduced Diamond membership roughly 3 weeks ago and so far we've already raised over 1000 ICP. It's worth noting that we gave out 1 year of Diamond membership to ~15k users for free (they were the users who had verified their phone number or paid for storage) and its likely many of them will pay for their Diamond membership once it is up for renewal.

In the future we plan on having many more revenue streams, eg. private communities (communities is a feature we will work on soon after the decentralisation sale), premium groups where we do a revenue share with the group owners, premium add-ons for groups and communities, integrations with 3rd party apps, and many more.

We currently have 82343 users (https://4bkt6-4aaaa-aaaaf-aaaiq-cai.raw.ic0.app/metrics).

Here are our active user numbers for the past month, I'll see what we can do about making this public.

![Screenshot 2023-02-27 at 23.16.29|690x214](upload://nF24ozrWwgfNL2JFV10xXbRA5lZ.png)

The dev team is made up of 3 people so is relatively low cost due to its small size.

-------------------------

Berg | 2023-02-28 06:25:19 UTC | #53

Sorry, but this is hardly a project with a $20M(?) valuation and the information you provided thus far on all channels I've seen is absolutely not enough for anyone to make a proper investment decision. 

This is basically Dfinity making money out of thin air: they are solo "seed" investors at an undisclosed valuation (probably less than $2M), also investing their maturity via the Community Fund and also wouldn't be surprised if they try to facilitate certain bots during the public sale to meet the 500 minimum quota.

P.S. How many of the 83k users of OC are real users?

-------------------------

Luffy | 2023-02-28 14:58:10 UTC | #54

the real users I guess less than 3000. so the $20M valuation is too high,that means each user is worth close to $2,000 

I want't buy it.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-02-28 16:09:22 UTC | #55

Some larger Open Chat groups hit around 10k users. There are ~17k Diamond (verified/paid) users. So it seems that there are probably about 10-15k real & active users.

Your 3000 seems to be heavily underestimated.

-------------------------

Luffy | 2023-03-01 00:10:10 UTC | #56

This is the blockchain community, and it is not a strange imagination for each user to have 5-10 paid accounts on average

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-03-01 23:43:20 UTC | #57

IcpElahw | 2023-03-07 03:38:51 UTC | #60

So I  committed 370 icp.  How many chat tokens will I receive?  When will I receive them and what are they worth?  There’s no mention of this information anywhere

-------------------------

megrogan | 2023-03-07 09:06:06 UTC | #61

You can find your CHAT neurons in the NNS dapp in the section [My neuron staking](https://nns.ic0.app/neurons) -> "OpenChat":

The information regarding the basket of CHAT nuerons you would receive for your ICP contribution is in the [Proposal to create an SNS-DAO for OpenChat](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/109811) - see the Governance section.

Also this information can be found in the [OpenChat SNS Whitepaper](https://oc.app/whitepaper?section=5-1-1).

25M CHAT tokens were sold for 1M ICP. So for your contribution of 370 ICP you should have received 25 * 370 = 9250 CHAT as 5 neurons each of 1850 CHAT.

At the time of the sale your tokens were worth 370 ICP.
