What did you struggle with when you first joined the community? What resources did you find most useful? Come to our [weekly online meeting](https://www.meetup.com/internet-computer-education-meetup/events/srvhpsyccmbjb/), occurring every **Monday @ 12:00 PT**, and help us (the DFINITY Education Fellows) shape the way future students will first interact with the IC!

We’re hosting these sessions to help community members learn more about **DFINITY Education** initiatives, provide feedback for our courses, and discuss common pain points in getting started with all things IC.

Additionally, **DFINITY Education** is excited to announce we’ve begun work on four new courses, each of which will be hosted on [edX](https://www.edx.org/), to help introduce students to the Internet Computer. These courses, made with both technical and non-technical students in mind, assume no prior knowledge of the IC or Motoko and are organized as follows:

**Course 1: Understanding the Internet Computer**

* A high-level overview of the platform (semi-technical)

**Course 2: A Dive into Motoko & Next Gen Programming on the Internet Computer**

* Aimed at bridging the gap for continuing Ed Devs (highly technical)

**Course 3: Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Applications on the Internet Computer**

* Helps Entrepreneurs understand tokenized applications and potential business models (semi-technical)

**Course 4: Building Enterprise Systems on the Internet Computer**

* Details how current microservice solutions can be structured and built on the IC (highly technical)

We hope to see you at our weekly discussion!

Connor, @rkotni , and @Nat8aliya

Yes, we're in the process of working through Course 1: Understanding the Internet Computer, which we hope to release on edX by the end of this fall. We'll continue to post updates with our progress on the forum!

Great initiative! I just came to know about it. Any updates? Personally, I think EDX is a great choice to deliver those courses!
