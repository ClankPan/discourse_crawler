Hello community!

We just released `V0.6.1` of the SDK :tada:

The `0.6.1` release only includes the following user-facing changes:

* An update to the  `dfx ping`  command enables you to specify a network name to check the status of a network connection.
* An update to the user authentication method enables  `dfx`  to use the browser’s  `localStorage`  for the user’s public and private keys if cookies are not enabled.
* Motoko programming guidelines are now available as part of the [programming language guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html) on the SDK website. Check out the Motoko style guidelines [here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/style.html).

All other new features and enhancements were included in the `0.6.0` release.

Cheers!
