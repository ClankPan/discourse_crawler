I've seen people having issues with their phone as well but don't see anyone mentioning issues logging into NNS with their computer. Its just stuck in loop loading "hang tight, starting your session". I'm not worried, I assumed my funds are safe and accessible but can anyone assure me the issue is being worked on?
