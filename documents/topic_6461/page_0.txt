Hi all! As I mentioned in a [previous post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-community-conversations/6438), we are starting a new initiative called ✨ **Community Conversations ✨** . This is a series of webinars hosted on Zoom to talk through and get your thoughts on technical updates & ongoing progress with the Internet Computer ecosystem. Of course, there will also be the opportunity for Q&A with the speakers.

Our first Community Conversation will be about the **Motoko Playground.** In addition to a high-level overview of Motoko Playground, Senior Software Yan Chen will be talking through a new feature which allows users to see how much a transaction costs right in the [Motoko Playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/).

We will have a live Q&A, but to better prepare, we'd love to hear what sort of topics you'd be interested in hearing more about! If you have any topics you'd like us to drill in more on, please let me know below. 

You can sign up for this Community Conversation [here](https://dfinity.org/conversations/). Seating is limited, but the sessions will be recorded and published to YouTube afterwards.

Thanks, and looking forward to seeing you there!
