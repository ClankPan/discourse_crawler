I'm using a canister with `"type": "assets"` and seeing the following:

Has anyone else experienced this?

If I use `curl` on these URLs I get the HTML for the service worker. I assume is what's happening in the above screenshots but if I browse to those URLs the files load in my browser.

I see that Open Chat is using `/_/raw/` for some things in its `index.html` file but not in its application manifest (`view-source:https://oc.app/`, or similar)

This all works locally so I'm assuming it's related to certification and the service worker.

As an aside, I'd prefer to get ahead of issues like this by having my local development environment also run the service worker but I haven't looked into doing that yet.

Your findings are correct.

Long story short, the IC (`ic0.app` core domain) does not support crawlers yet. That's why, if you want your meta data - such as icons defined in the `<head />` of your `index.html` or `manifest` file - to be interpreted correctly, the `.raw.ic0.app` domain (or shortcut `/_raw/`) can be used as a workaround (as OpenChat, NNS-dapp and all my dapps do).

On the secure domain `ic0.app`, any requests is intercepted by the service worker which takes care of executing the calls and certifying that it is secure. This works as intended in the browser but, does not when a `curl` is performed or when a crawler request a resources. As you noticed, the answer is the one page that loads the service worker but, nothing happens afterwards because well, there are no service worker in that context.

This is a known limitation - or issue depends the point of view üòâ - and various scenario and tasks are open and on going about it. I did not check recently what are the status therefore cannot really tell spontaneously where they stand.

Thanks @peterparker.

I was wondering how https://oc.app/openchat.webmanifest doesn't use `raw` URLs but I just realized that doesn't work and has the same issues I'm seeing.

I'm not sure how I'm going to tell `esbuild` how to special case all of these problematic URLs but I guess I'll look into that.

If I remember correctly OC use the `/_raw/` domain to load their custom service worker.

In NNS-dapp, if it can help, we just reference the [manifest.json](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/b5d09836dea04c1c099522d5ed000a3d8f1cb898/frontend/src/index.html#L40) from root. Nothing particular. On the contrary, [Icons](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/b5d09836dea04c1c099522d5ed000a3d8f1cb898/frontend/src/index.html#L42) and manifest [icons](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/b5d09836dea04c1c099522d5ed000a3d8f1cb898/frontend/static/manifest.json#L11) are specified through the `raw` domain. This to solve the issue you shared but also because otherwise, when installing the dapp on mobile devices (iPhone), the icons would not be interpreted (iOS uses a crawler to get the icons it seems). 

Hope that help, let me know if you have more questions (might answer tomorrow though, it's late here üòâ).

For some reason `/_/raw/` isn't working for my canister. Is there anything I need to do to enable that?

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-09-02 02:49:43 UTC | #6

Apparently that no longer works.

https://github.com/dfinity/icx-proxy/pull/26

That makes things a bit more complicated because now I can't just prepend `/_/raw/` to relative asset paths.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-02 05:10:53 UTC | #7

Ummm a bit suprised it does not work anymore because OC still uses it on mainnet to load their service worker

On the contrary, as I do, they load the asset from the `https://....raw.ic0.app/...` domain. Can you also try this?

Wondering if the latest updates for crawlers will allow me to revert back to non-raw URLs.

I just tried with NNS-dapp on a testnet. It did not work out but, I may have missed something. I will ping my colleagues to find more information and will comeback to this thread.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-30 08:02:06 UTC | #10

Turned out I was testing on a deprecated testnet which does not fully support the new feature.  However I cannot test yet with NNS-dapp on a new testnets because these are not yet accessible through a valid SSL. My collleagues using `curl` confirmed it worked out though.

But I'm a frontend developer, I believe what I click and see üòâ. So I'll wait for the full test and will update the thread when I'll will do so (can take a bit of time).
