We are following the path that Neutrinite has taken: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/neutrinite-dao-invitation/25856/1

Following the Gold DAO generous investment of 100'000 ICP https://x.com/gldrwa/status/1805332480809222171, as well as SONIC's investment of 5'000 ICP  https://x.com/sonic_ooo/status/1805828869414600764. We invite all the DAOs to contribute with 5'000 ICP to WaterNeuron. This makes sense as WaterNeuron is a governance-driven DAO and all the SNS project should be interested in the IC governance.

Once a proposal gets accepted, anyone can call a function in the swap canister to notify it the transfer was made.

Are you sure you're not a scram? You even got the name of the DAO wrong.

People don't read proposals lol. They made one for each Dao  and made a few mistakes in the descriptions but I understand they wanted these to pass before sale ended.

We were in a rush because the treasury proposals take time and we had to submit them asap.

Given all the interest WaterNeuron has attracted from other DAOs and even node providers, I wonder if DFINITY is planning on participating in the sale (perhaps waiting until the last moment so that the community has had first refusal)?

My hunch is that this would be a smart move from the standpoint of governance decentralisation (scooping up WTN tokens now while they're cheap, and either holding and staking those for the long term to fund governance decentralisation efforts, or to grant WTN tokens (to be staked) to those driving governance decentralisation initiatives so that they have a means of funding themselves in the long-term). Do you have any thoughts on this @ld-dfn1?

Yes, we plan to participate.
