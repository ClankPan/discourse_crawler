I am attempting to implement the extendable token standard in TypeScript (see https://github.com/lastmjs/azle).

The extendable token standard implementation in Motoko has a variant with a field named `principal`: https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/extendable-token/blob/main/standards/ext-core.mo#L9

I am trying to create a hand-written candid file with that same variant:

```
type User = variant {
    address: text;
    principal: principal;
};
```

But I am getting an unexpected token error:

```bash
principal: principal;
  │     ^^^^^^^^^ Unexpected token
  │
  = Expects one of "decimal", "hex", "id", "text", "}
```

I assume this is because `principal` is a reserved word in candid. But...how can I match the Motoko variant which has a variant named `principal`?

You can quote the field name: `"principal": principal`

Thanks a lot, it works!
