why is the asset canister adding an encoding of type `identity` to every http request and what does this `identity` represent?

`identity` is the default value of accepted encoding that the server can always fall back to even if the client omits this encoding in the `Accept-Encoding` header.

> `identity`
> Indicates the identity function (that is, without modification or compression). This value is always considered as acceptable, even if omitted.

One issue with the certified assets canister is that it doesn't handle the content negotiation very well because the HTTP asset certification scheme is somewhat limited: the scheme only supports a single value for an asset at a given request path. We're planning to address this (and a few other) issue in the next version of HTTP certification protocol.
