Does anyone know why dfx is no longer generating the same IDs as it used to?

Previously, when I was using version `v0.13.1`, I could install the canisters in the same order and consistently get the same IDs. However, after trying `v0.14.3`, I noticed that I now get random new canister IDs even when performing the exact same fresh installation.

For example, I used to install the `CMC` canister as the third canister of my installation process and always got the ID `rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai` because it is mandatory to use that ID. But with `v0.14.3`, I now get the random ID `bw4dl-smaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai` or `br5f7-7uaaa-aaaaa-qaaca-cai` etc. every time another ID. Does anyone have an explanation for this change in behavior?

Yes, the IDs generated have changed, but they are not random. Reason being that now we allow specifying canister IDs and we changed the starting point for automatically-chosen IDs so that you never accidentally create a canister with an ID you would later want to specify.
