Since there are no more rewards , what is the incentive of having a locked neuron for 100 years , this would make the dkp neuron as  useless asset.

I would suggest a proposal to unlock all neurons and allow users to chose again to lock or unlock since the tokenomics changed drastically. 
We should offer users the choice to lock or unlock their neurons since the context changed. 

I my self have bought a 100 years dkp neuron and i am really wondering what utility it could provide. 

Please let me know your thoughts 
Thanks

Good question :slight_smile: 

It will be some exclusive in-game benefit that nobody else can get.  Think like you're the one person in the game that can give a certain quest to unlock Onyxia's lair, or you're the only one that can transform Draggin type X into Y.

It's part of the Role system which is central to the design, it's not an afterthought.

We're still super busy with the code and design is all over the place but don't worry, we haven't forgotten.

Why not create a NFT instead? What benefit does a 100 year have over an NFT that needs to be purchased to access said features of Dragginz?

We'll have those too, but they'll have a different type of effect on the gameplay than the DKP.

We didn't think people would lock for 100 years without knowing what the consequences would be... but we'll happily go back and make it worth their while.

How to leverage number of  dkp tokens locked and dissolve delay ?

What would be the advantage of having 1 millions dkp locked for 100 years vs 1000 dkp locked for 6 months ?
My point is that you can provide these unique privileges with just dkp , no need to lock the thing...

Honestly I dont know, that's an upcoming design decision that we need to make.
