I want to do an airdrop of my token to **all** users of Internet Computer, that is to all Internet Identities.

Is it possible to enumerate all ICP Internet Identities' wallet addresses? If yes, how?

No, II is designed with a lot of privacy in mind. You'd have to find a different source of principals. I know the GHOST people did some big airdrop in the past, maybe you could talk to them? Or DSCVR does airdrops occasionally, maybe they'd be happy to help?
