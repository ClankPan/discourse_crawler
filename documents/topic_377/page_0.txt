Greetings, community!

We are excited to announce that V0.4.13 is now available for download! :partying_face:

**What's new?**
* Inter-canister calls are now supported.
This release includes multiple backend enhancements to both the SDK and Motoko as scaffolding to support inter-canister calls. Inter-canister calls enable you to build applications in which canisters make calls to each other. Some of the backend changes introduced to support inter-canister calls include the following:
-- The ability to identify a canister using a caller id
-- The ability to import canister function by a caller id or alias

* New  `dfx canister call`   `--query`  and  `--update`  flags for you to explicitly specify whether you are making a query call or an update call when accessing a canisterâ€™s methods.
* New  `dfx canister`   `--client`  option that enables you to specify the client host name or IP address and port to connect to. This option enables you to override the client setting specified in the dfx configuration file.
* Improvements to the handling of front-end static assets so they can be deployed as part of a canister or served from a bootstrap web server.
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support added for the webserver.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin access to selected resources from a different origin. With this added support, you can have the client running  `dfx start`  on a server and connect to it from a static bootstrap server.

Note: The backend changes for inter-canister calls and for handling of front-end assets are not directly exposed in documentation for this release. User-facing changes for these features will be documented with sample code in an upcoming release.

Fixes include added stability for  `dfx canister call` and several minor fixes to improve front-end experience.

Additional documentation will be coming soon on navigating the front-end! In the meantime, you can check out the progress on our LinkedUp demo app here: https://github.com/dfinity-lab/linkedup

Happy coding!
