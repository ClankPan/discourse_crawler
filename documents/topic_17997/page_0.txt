Error: The invocation to the wallet call forward method failed with the error: An error happened during the call: 2: Couldn't send message

Was there an update on deleting canisters, because couple of days ago, i was able to delete a canister and my cycles returned to wallet. But since yesterday im having trouble to delete a canister to free up come cycles.. Above was the error message when i delete canisters using the the ff. syntax--- dfx canister --network ic delete --all

Was happening with me too, couldn't find some potential solution for this.

I already have a fix for it, but it's not in a released version of dfx yet. See [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cannot-delete-canisters-anymore/11594/33) for more details
