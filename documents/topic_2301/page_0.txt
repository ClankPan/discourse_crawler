Hi everyone, 

I want to create a react front end that will not be hosted directly in a canister. I know that I must use the agent to make the connection but I am really confused and I do not know how to do it. Is there any example that is currently working on version 0.6.26? Is it something that I miss from the documentation that will help me to make this connection? 

Thank you.

Hi Thanasis,

As of this morning, the easiest way to get up and running is with this Create React App template: https://github.com/taylorham/cra-template-dfx

That said, stay tuned for some news today-ish!
