Hi!

First of all I want to say the support and responsiveness in this community is great.

I want to implement my own file storage system to get past the 4GB canister size limit, or to implement my own sharding system. Is it possible to have a canister create other canisters to scale dynamically?

Here’s one example: https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/classes

> This example demonstrates a simple use of actor classes, which allow a program to dynamically install new actors (that is, canisters)

There’s also something called `BigMap` in the works which apparently abstracts something like this away behind a `HashMap` API.

Yes hopefully someone from Dfinity can comment on the status of BigMap. It will be huge for us devs...
