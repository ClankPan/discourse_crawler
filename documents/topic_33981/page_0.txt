@andrea kindly provided a reference for the recent urz34 (II system subnet) proposals here -> [Subnet Management - pzp6e (Fiduciary) - Developers - Internet Computer Developer Forum (dfinity.org)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-pzp6e-fiduciary/33664/3)

[quote="andrea, post:1, topic:33829"]
For the Schnorr keys, we are proposing to back them up on subnet `uzr34`, which has the same size as the fiduciary subnet and serves as backup subnet of the ECDSA production key. Note that the key backup process requires the backup subnet to pause while the key is being reshared. Since the proposed backup subnet hosts the II canister smart contract, this will not process new messages while the backup is in progress.

As this process is not yet fully automated, **it requires 3 NNS proposals** to be submitted, voted on, and executed in sequence. The result is downtime for the II subnet, estimated to be between 6-10 minutes
[/quote]

1. [Proposal: 131506 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131506)
    - "Halt subnet uzr34 at the next CUP height and update ssh readonly access. This is the first proposal (out of three) for resharing the threshold Schnorr keys Bip340Secp256k1:key_1 and Ed25519:key_1 from subnet pzp6e to subnet uzr34." 


2. [Proposal: 131510 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131510)
    - "Reshare the threshold Schnorr keys Bip340Secp256k1:key_1 and Ed25519:key_1 to subnet uzr34 **by updating its recovery CUP.** This is the second proposal (out of three) for resharing the threshold Schnorr keys Bip340Secp256k1:key_1 and Ed25519:key_1 from subnet pzp6e to subnet uzr34" 

3. [Proposal: 131511 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131511)
   - "Unhalt subnet uzr34 and remove ssh readonly access. This is the third and last proposal for resharing the threshold Schnorr keys Bip340Secp256k1:key_1 and Ed25519:key_1 from subnet pzp6e to subnet uzr34"

I adopted the 1st and 3rd proposals, but rejected the update recovery CUP proposal, as [discussed here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-fuqsr-application/33655/10). Nevertheless, I'm super excited to see these signature schemes used outside the context of the test key subnets 🚀

A proposed change to IC target topology that will affect this subnet has been announced in [this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/adjustment-of-ic-target-topology-to-increase-subnet-size-of-fiduciary-and-ii-subnets/34210).

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-22 08:11:46 UTC | #4

There’s an open proposal for removing a node from this subnet (along with 2 other subnets - [5kdm2 (Application)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-5kdm2-application/33661/3) and  [tdb26 (NNS)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-tdb26-nns/33663/8))
- [Proposal 132102](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132102)

**I intend to take a closer look later today after work**. But for now here's some contextual info for interested voters.

<details>
        <summary>Map Description</summary>

- **Red** marker represents a removed node (transparent center for overlap visibility)
- **Blue** marker represents an unchanged node
- Highlighted patches represent the country the above nodes sit within
- **Light grey** markers with yellow borders are examples of unassigned nodes that would be viable candidates for joining the subnet according to formal decentralisation coefficients (so this proposal can be viewed in the context of alternative solutions that are not being used - plenty of nodes that the removed node could have been swapped with if this were a 'Change Subnet Membership' proposal)

[quote="Lorimer, post:4, topic:33981"]
I intend to take a closer look later today after work
[/quote]

I've **rejected** this proposal for numerous reasons. **TLDR**: It doesn't actually fix anything, and is unjustified in violating the target IC topology, even if it's temporary (there's insufficient information provided in the summary to explain why they've proposed this removal in this way):
<details>
<summary>Expand for more details</summary>

 - This proposal doesn't fix the problem of an offline node. Instead it's removing it from the subnet for some unexplained / unjustified reason (unjustified because it's not transactionally replacing the node with a good one)
 - 'Remove node from subnet' proposals are for shrinking subnets (this isn't and shouldn't be the intention here). 'Change Subnet Membership' proposals are for fixing bad nodes in a subnet (by transactionally swapping them out for good nodes) - which is the proposal type that should have been proposed, and that this proposal should (in my opinion) be superseded by (after rejecting).
 - This proposal has a very poor summary (historically these types of proposals have provided much more information in the summary, such as the affected subnets, and the precise set of steps are are planned to follow the proposal). Ever since the 'Change Subnet Membership' proposal type was implemented, 'Remove node from subnet' proposals have become more or less a thing of the past (at least in this sort of scenario).
   - The proposal does not clearly state what the next steps would be (which IPv6 and IPv4 enabled nodes would be deployed as a next step?)
   - Why isn't this being done transactionally under one proposal per subnet (why is it justifiable  to ask the community to vote the subnet into a state that violates the formal target topology?)
 - Accepting this proposal would leave the 3 affected subnets in a state that is in violation of the [formally voted in target IC topology](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125549) (and in even further violation of the topology that is likely to soon be proposed - 34 nodes instead of 28 on the II subnet)

 - There's only one [other Subnet Management proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-pzp6e-fiduciary/33664/9) proposed by this neuron historically, and it was also worthy of rejection in my opinion (currently that proposal is still open).

Hi @Lorimer 
As per our discussion here, the reason is highlighted
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-tdb26-nns/33663/10

I think this is the first time NP ongoing maintenance is happening. There might be future reasons where hardware failure, or network device failure for the redeployment of nodes.

Thus NP wiki is getting improved with these learnings. Right now it is at its basically level of info for ongoing node maintenance  
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Changing_IPv6_addresses_of_nodes

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-23 07:52:21 UTC | #7

Thanks @MalithHatananchchige, I really appreciate your reaching out and providing some clarity. This really helps, and I'm glad to see that you're open to improving processes in the future :slightly_smiling_face:. 

Regarding the removal of the nodes from the subnet, can I ask why this was not a proposal to swap in a good node (so that the subnet topology, in terms of cardinality, is not formally modified)? I'm still of the impression that this proposal should be rejected, and replaced with a 'Change Subnet Membership' proposal (as highlighted there are plenty of spare nodes to swap into the network). This would then free up your CM1 nodes so that they can be removed from the wider network and redeployed with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

-------------------------

[quote="Lorimer, post:7, topic:33981"] Change Subnet Membership’ proposal [/quote]

I wasn't aware that this was the correct procedure. The Dfinity team had initially suggested following the guidelines outlined here: [Changing IPv6 addresses of nodes](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Changing_IPv6_addresses_of_nodes).

However, after reviewing your input, it makes more sense to change the subnet membership rather than removing the node from the subnet entirely. This highlights a significant knowledge gap, as well as the need for clearer documentation regarding which proposals to use in different situations.

I fully agree that taking nodes offline isn't the best approach, especially when we have plenty of spare nodes that can be swapped in. In fact, the migration process itself takes less than an hour, so minimizing downtime is entirely feasible.

That said, wouldn’t introducing another NNS proposal potentially increase the downtime even further while waiting for approval? If the current proposal is adopted, I could redeploy all nodes back online within an hour. Just a suggestion to consider.

[/quote]

You could submit a proposal to add or swap a replacement node into the subnet now (you don't need to wait). Just inform voters that they should reject the prior proposal in your proposal summary. At least, this is my understanding.

I agree that documentation is lacking. I'm basing my opinion and voting decision-making off of my own critical thinking, and formally voted in IC target subnet topology that should not be violated without good reason (in my opinion).

*Busy day at work now for me, so I won't be able to respond until later, FYI*

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-08-23 10:14:12 UTC | #11

Hi @MalithHatananchchige @Lorimer thanks for this discussion and allow me to join in as well. Agree that the wiki documentation can be improved on this, but indeed the common approach for node maintenance (and I think that is usually agreed in the Element channel as well) is to
1. swap the node that needs to be upgraded (or nodes that are unhealthy or dead and require and upgrade) for another node that is healthy.
2. now that the node to be upgraded is "not active in a subnet", to remove that node from the IC so it can be upgraded.

The reason is that removing an active node from a subnet would reduce that subnet size to 12 (for a 13 node subnet) and 33 (for a 34 node subnet) which we want to avoid as this effectively creates a subnet with fewer nodes and this would reduce the thresholds on the subnet.

I also agree that before submitting a proposal it would be good to announce it on the forum, so that it can be discussed and will avoid unncessary rejects on the proposal and the loss of ICP of course due to that. 

@MalithHatananchchige for the above reason the Foundation will reject proposal [131977](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131977) and proposal [132102](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132102). Can I suggest you to align with me and @sat on the Element channel so we can help with submitting the node swap proposals first? After these proposals are adopted, you can then proceed with remove the nodes from the IC to upgrade the network config.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-24 13:47:50 UTC | #12

There's currently a new open 'Change Subnet Membership' proposal for this subnet.

-------------------

### [Proposal 132142](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132142)

**TLDR**: I've **rejected** this proposal as it does not solve the offline node issue, and the payload parameters appear to contains errors.

- Note that node **xetvj** is included in both the nodes removed and nodes added parameters of the payload. Swapping nodes is supposed to be a transactional operation  (I wouldn't be surprised if this would fail to execute).

- The other node swap in this proposal is taking the opportunity to improve subnet decentralisation (given there’s already a need for a proposal). 1 node (the only node in Germany) is proposed to be replaced with one node in Latvia. This brings the owner coefficient into the acceptable range (the subnet was previously violating it), **however**, this proposal still leaves the subnet in a state that is heavily in violation of the formally voted in IC Target Topology. There is supposed to be no more than 3 nodes in the same country (not 6 nodes in one country).

My suggestion would be to reject this proposal and resubmit one that solves the offline node problem, and gets this critical subnet back into a state that conforms to the IC target topology (else clearly explain in the proposal summary why this latter point is not feasible).

<details>
        <summary>Decentralisation Stats</summary>

### Subnet node distance stats (distance between any 2 nodes in the subnet) ->

|            |Smallest Distance|Average Distance|Largest Distance|
|------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
|**EXISTING**|304.39 km|8096.623 km|19442.91 km|
|**PROPOSED**|**285.152 km (-6.3%)** |8095.772 km |19442.91 km |

This proposal slightly decreases decentralisation, considered purely in terms of geographic distance (and therefore there's a slight theoretical decrease in localised disaster resilience). 👎

### Subnet characteristic counts ->

|            |Continents |Countries|Data Centers|Owners|Node Providers|
|------------|-----------|---------|------------|------|--------------|
|**EXISTING**|5|22|28|27|28|
|**PROPOSED**|5|22|28|**28 (+3.6%)**|28|

This proposal significantly improves decentralisation in terms of data center ownership diversity. 👍

### Largest number of nodes with the same characteristic (e.g. continent, country, data center, etc.) ->

|            |Continent |Country|Data Center|Owner|Node Provider|
|------------|----------|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|
|**EXISTING**|9|6|1|2|1|
|**PROPOSED**|9 |6 |1 |**1  (-50%)**|1 |

See here for acceptable limits -> [Motion 125549](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125549) (note that these are due for [a slight revision](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/adjustment-of-ic-target-topology-to-increase-subnet-size-of-fiduciary-and-ii-subnets/34210))

The above subnet information is illustrated below, followed by a node reference table:

I just submitted a new proposal https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132186 that replaces 2 dead nodes and provides more details (compared to previous proposals) on why we didn't replace more nodes to optimize decentralization.
I also added some details on the "business rules" calculations, which includes the penalties for the distance from the target topology.
I hope this helps analyze and reason about the value that the replacement has.

Thanks @Sat, I really appreciate the work you've put in to adding more transparency and clarity to the proposal summaries. It's good that this summary is making it clear to voters that no solution could be found that improves decentralisation. The only solution that could be found is one that decreases decentralisation, and takes this subnet further away from the target topology.

I'm planning to take a closer look tomorrow, but in the meantime, would you be able to provide some clarity on why the following nodes were not considered as viable replacement nodes?

Based on a quick initial analysis, all 14 of these nodes appear to be valid candidates for swapping into this subnet while **improving** decentralisation, rather than making it worse (none of these nodes belong to the same country, data center, owner, nor node provider as any other node already in this subnet).

I expect I'm missing something. Thanks in advance 🙏

So a Paris node would have made the Continent decentralization worse. And all other nodes you have in the list are also in Europe. So they would have given the same result(s).

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-28 12:20:35 UTC | #16

Hi @Sat, thanks for your response. Continent isn't a feature of the previous nor current IC Target Topology (diversity in this dimension is a *nice to have* as long as the formal target topology coefficients have been met first). This is what the IC Target Topology specifies.

In your example above `os2wv` was not one of the nodes that I proposed, and therefore the effect on the data center nakamoto coefficient would not occur with the suggested replacements.

My understanding so far is that this proposal is unjustified in taking this subnet even further away from the target topology than it already is. There are solutions that bring it closer to the IC target topology, and I'm still unclear on why these solutions are not being prioritised.

Can we agree that it would be best to reject this proposal, and resubmit one that protects the IC Target Topology from even further deviation?

-------------------------

sat | 2024-08-28 13:23:36 UTC | #17

Sorry but no. In contrast to whatever that single proposal (for target topology) says, I personally do care about all dimensions of decentralization. Making one significantly worse in order to make another one potentially a bit better is from my point of view not a good tradeoff. You are welcome to submit another proposal though and let the community decide on it. 😇

-------------------------

sat | 2024-08-28 13:38:38 UTC | #18

Also, this proposal was submitted so that the NP can run some management ops on the nodes. Once the nodes are back to operational, the decentralization will improve once again. I see no benefit in rejecting the proposal.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-28 19:18:59 UTC | #19

Motion proposals are clearly important, and represent a stringent and meaningful deliberation process that has involved a large number of people. This shouldn't be overturned on personal whim (do you represent DFINITY with your stance on this?).

There are many more dimensions that aren't considered, ones that are far more important than continent (which is worth noting when talking about *all* dimensions). The [IC target topology motion](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132136) could very easily have contained a column for continent limits per subnet, but it didn't because it's not important enough (**the other dimensions are**). In fact [I brought up the lack of continent](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/465) in the official coefficients before the most recent IC Target Topology was announced, but the response was that this would require more discussion (and this didn't make it into the announcement nor motion proposal).

1. I think it's worth noting that the majority of subnets have a Nakamoto coefficient of 1 for continent, and this is perfectly acceptable and allowed by the IC target topology.

2. This proposal reduces the country Nakamoto coefficient from 6 to 5, and reduces the data center Nakamoto coefficient from 9 to 8. There's no way that's justified. There should be no more than 3 nodes per country, and no more than 1 node per data center. This subnet already has 5 in the same country, and 2 with the same data center, and this proposal takes the subnet further away from resolving this problem.

3. Most importantly, there's no need to sacrifice on continent coefficient as you suggest. If this is your concern why don't you submit a pair of proposals to free up a non-European node for this subnet (while swapping an available European node into the other subnet)?

I think this is flawed logic, and an appeal to consequences fallacy. *The proposal in and of itself is bad, but don't worry because I'll plan to undo it afterwards*. There's no guarantee this will be possible (as it depends on nodes that are available later, and their affinity for this subnet, which is unpredictable). I expect this sort of situation is why so many important subnets are so far away from their target topology (including the NNS).

I understand you have your stance on this. I hope I've justified mine, and clearly explained why I've rejected this proposal, and believe it would be prudent for others to too.

As a side note, tone is a difficult thing to convey in text form, but I hope it's clear there's no animosity in this post. I take my responsibility as a known neuron (and potential followee) seriously 🙂

Hi @Lorimer ,

I very much appreciate your thorough feedback. This is what decentralization is all about, and I'm very happy that you have such a critical view. To be clear, I'm not acting or overturning anything "based on a personal whim". This proposal was prepared and submitted by the same tooling we have been using over the previous 2+ years. I'll try to explain below the reasoning behind my earlier comment.

The continent coefficient isn’t a primary focus of our IC Target Topology, but IMHO it’s worth examining its implications more closely.

1. **Importance of Continent Coefficient**: In cases where subnets are predominantly located in one continent, like Europe, the continent coefficient could play a significant role in overall decentralization. Continent diversity can help mitigate risks tied to geopolitical or regulatory factors.
2. **Evaluating Trade-offs**: This particular proposal reduces the Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) from 6 to 5, meaning that it reduces the country NC for 16.6%. However, it a) addresses immediate operational issues and b) does not change the continent NC. The reduction of the continent NC would be 50%, and any critical event in Europe would either stop the II subnet, or even risk the threshold keys that sit on this subnet. I find that potentially much worse than expecting that **5 countries** would collude vs previous 6 countries to collude. Both 5 and 6 are fairly high numbers and both are similarly unlikely.
3. **Future Considerations**: We have had the requirement of the continent diversity in our tooling for over 2 years now, and the proposals submitted by the tooling have been internally scrutinized all that time. The motion proposal that you refer to has been scrutinized over much shorter time (albeit by more people), and I also see no discussion in the forum about the continent aspect. So it might have been an accidental omission. In most cases the continent factor is not extremely important - I agree. But in certain cases, like the EU, it may be. We will need to discuss whether something needs to be changed in the decentralization strategy and the target topology and we may need to submit another motion proposal. Either way -- thank you for pointing out this discrepancy!

Balancing operational needs with decentralization goals is complex, and your suggestions provide valuable insights -- thank you once more!

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-29 08:38:50 UTC | #21

Thanks @sat, I'm just about to start a busy day at work so can't commit much to this response at the moment, but wanted to share a few quick comments.

I really appreciate your response, and I agree that the motion proposal would need re-submitting with the parameters that are actually deemed important (before then though, this proposal needs rejecting, as it violates the motion that currently stands). I would also suggest that the premise for any new motion proposal should be reworded to make it clear that current tooling only allows for an 'estimation' that there are currently enough nodes (this isn't known for sure). <- This is a separate issue, but worth noting.

[quote="sat, post:20, topic:33981"]
This proposal was prepared and submitted by the same tooling we have been using over the previous 2+ years.
[/quote]

...and this is the same tooling and business processes that have led to subnets such as the NNS drifting into far away topology states that are clearly more dangerous than is tolerable -> 

[quote="Lorimer, post:23, topic:34210"]
It really must be emphasised that the **NNS subnet** (the most security-critical one) currently has:

* **8 nodes in the same country** (instead of the *achievable* target of 3)
* **2 nodes in the same data center** (instead of the *achievable* target of 1)
* **3 nodes with the same owner** (instead of the *achievable* target of 1)
* **2 nodes from the same node provider** (instead of the *achievable* target of 1)
[/quote]

Just to reiterate, if it's really important to you, there are viable approaches to move forward that do not require your continent coefficient to be violated, nor the rules of the standing motion proposal. It would require the community to reject this proposal, and for a pair of proposals to be submitted next.
- One that swaps a European node into another subnet, while swapping an appropriate non-European node out
- A second proposal that swaps that non-European node into this subnet

I think it's clear that this is what should be considered best practise. In the context of a decentralised, trustless system such as the IC NNS, the community needs to rely on best practises being adhered to, and less so on trust and/or authoritative pushback on the forum.

-------

At the end of the day, there's no reason to violate the IC target topology. Can you agree that violating the IC target topology (in the way that this proposal does) is unnecessary? Would you therefore also open up to the idea that this proposal needs rejecting to help set a best practice standard for the future? 😇

I tried a somewhat cruder approach of using the [decentralization](https://github.com/StephanusFischer/decentralization) tool to tabulate all the network nodes and then re-sorting the table by the various parameters in order to search for eligible replacement nodes. I came up with a number of possibilities, but how about these ones for example?

End result: This selection prevents any of the target topology parameters from going over the limit (beyond those that already are) but worsens the Nakamoto coefficients.

So which is the better measure?

[/quote]

And that is exactly the key question. So far in the tooling we have been following the Nakamoto Coefficients across multiple dimensions as the driving factor for the topology since it's the golden  standard for measuring network decentralization ([e.g. here](https://nakaflow.io/)). For instance, even if we 100% strictly follow the target topology, we still have the [NC of 5 for the NNS subnet](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/adjustment-of-ic-target-topology-to-increase-subnet-size-of-fiduciary-and-ii-subnets/34210/26?u=sat). We would have the [NC of 4 for Country on uzr34 (II subnet)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=n+%3D+ceiling%2828%2F3+%2F+3%29). So there is really no need to over-dramatize here or pretend that it's absolutely critical to be super pedantic here. It's just different measures of decentralization, and all of them are reasonably good. Which one is better.... I guess depends.
And it's up to us to discuss. In a civilized discussion, of course.

Note that NC is often (on different crypto projects) calculated just in a single dimension -- per "node providers". We calculate it across multiple dimensions, which may or may not be necessary. I personally think it's reasonable and useful to calculate and compare across multiple dimensions. But I don't speak in the name of the entire DFINITY, and I'm not against changing the current implementation if there is a good argument for it.
For instance, one could argue that all City & Country & Continent dimensions aren't as important as the ISP (DC owner) or the DC. And certainly not as important as the NP. One could also argue that they are important. I guess depends on the point of view, and I'd welcome some suggestions on how to do the weighting (importance) of these dimensions on the final NC.

SvenF | 2024-08-29 16:37:13 UTC | #27

Just to chime in on the discussion here, the IC-network is an **operational network on which real businesses are running their (decentralized) applications**. So the first priority should be the **stability and security** of the IC-network and subnets, in particular the key subnets such as NNS, SNS, II and Fiduciary subnets. If 2 or more nodes in a subnet are unhealthy or dead, they should be replaced as soon as possible. When this is not done, and additional nodes become unhealthy or dead in the same subnet - which fortunately has not happened so far - this could stall the subnet or even the IC (if it would be the NNS). The operations team is using the dre-tooling on a daily (operational) basis for subnet monitoring and node replacements, and my opinion is that we should not blur (short term/long term) improvement discussions with operational processes that risk the stability of the IC. 

I think everybody agrees that the current DRE tooling uses different coefficients than the target topology, that this needs to be aligned to each other, and that maybe in the future other decentralization coefficients like ISP and Node Operator are relevant to be added. I think everybody also agrees that through all subnet proposals, the goal is to achieve (at some point in the future, preferably earlier than later) the exact target topology that the optimization tooling calculates. That's why it is called "**target** topology" and not just "topology". @timk11 @Lorimer if you are willing to think about and help/contribute creating a roadmap for improvements that would be great.

This is a question that has been deliberated and resulted in motion proposals, where the IC Target Topology constraints have been intentionally specified in terms of limits, not in terms of Nakamoto coefficients (which is a related but different concept). This isn't the thread for debating what we should be trying to adhere to (that's what the motion was for).

I'm not over dramatizing anything. I'm pointing out real problems, and a lack of adherence to the currently standing motion proposal (which has clearly been a pattern).

I'm also pointing out the needlessness of this lack of adherence. This proposal unnecessarily goes against the terms laid out in the motion proposal.

Agreed, this isn't the place for debating what the motion proposal should have contained.

Agreed. I think this proposal should be rejected promptly and replaced with appropriate proposals, which I would be prompt to accept. There's no reason this can't be done without taking this subnet even further away from the target topology (which also contributes to loss of security and resilience). **A reason has not yet been provided as to why this would not be the best course of action.** :)

Thanks @SvenF, I'm currently planning a stochastic optimisation tool that should be capable of confirming the achievability of arbitrary target topologies given arbitrary nodes, subnets, characteristics, and constraints. I'm also intending for this to be capable of charting minimal steps (in terms of proposals) to take a topology from an arbitrary state to an optimal state. I'm hoping to have a working prototype soon :)

I think the reasons have been very clearly specified, the first one being that the node replacements as calculated by the operational dre tooling give a replacement proposal that optimizes the decentralization coefficients - although it takes into account an extra decentralization parameter that is not used in the target topology, which should be brought in line in the future - and second, rejecting the proposal means submitting a new proposal and another four days of voting which would delay critical node replacements. Operational stability and security of the subnets should be the primary priority. But in the end, it is for the community to decide on the proposal.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-29 19:22:08 UTC | #30

1. There's no real urgency. One of the two nodes that were down is now back up. In addition, my understanding was that this was part of a planned exercise in order for the NP to run management operations on those nodes.
2. There are plenty of ways of achieving the desired outcome without taking the subnet further away from the IC target topology.

Given that there's no urgency, I do not see a justification for proceeding with this proposal (given the currently standing motion that was passed by the community). Voting in favour of this proposal means voting against the terms laid out by that motion (though few that cast their vote will realise this).

[quote="SvenF, post:29, topic:33981"]

The majority of those voting on this proposal have no idea where to look for this sort of critical discussion. The proposal was submitted without a link to a forum topic. I expect it will pass, either because of this, or because the DFINITY known neuron will weigh in (reflecting the opinions that have already been shared by you and Sat).

timk11 | 2024-08-30 02:58:47 UTC | #31

Thank you @sat and @SvenF for the further discussion on the sorts of priorities that are being applied and that need to be applied here. I absolutely agree that the discussion should stay civilised and respectful, as should be the case for any discussion at all on this forum. You and your teams have been working on these issues full-time for a long time now, whereas I've come into this quite recently and embarked upon a huge learning curve to understand what's involved in keeping the IC running effectively and safely. As part of a team that's now been tasked with reviewing and voting on Subnet Management, Node Provider and Participant Management proposals (once the new grants for this are formally underway), I've found these discussions very helpful for getting my head around all the relevant considerations and developing a way of thinking about these decisions.

My question
[quote="timk11, post:24, topic:33981"]

was deliberately intended to provoke some further nutting out of the priorities involved. It's certainly not a black and white question with a single right answer. Part of the question is about how rigorously the target topology should be adhered to, and obviously there's a balance to be struck. Indeed, there are discrepancies between the current DRE tooling and the target topology, and this will be good to reconcile over time. Thanks again for your very helpful answers to these questions.

Motion proposals should be adhered to *where possible* - otherwise what's the point of the motion proposal?

I'd be interested to know why the DRE team are reluctant to swap an appropriate node out of another subnet in order to swap it into this subnet? Is this not the perfect example of when it would be appropriate to do this? If it's not appropriate to do this now, when is it ever appropriate to do this?

I'd also be interested to know why these proposals keep getting submitted without a link to the forum despite multiple requests for this?

I'd also like to say that I think this has been a civilised back a forth (please let me know if this is at odds with anyone's experience).

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-30 07:27:44 UTC | #33

A couple of questions to add if that's okay @sat  and @SvenF :
1. Can I ask where to find information regarding whether a particular node machine has Secure Encrypted Virtualisation (SEV)?
2. Out of interest, given that subnet membership changes are about updating the registry (while it's the node's job to poll the registry and join the appropriate subnet), could a single 'AddNodeToSubnet' proposal be used to reassign a node from one subnet to another (in a single proposal). I can see that historically it hasn't been used this way, but based on my understanding of what the underlying membership mechanism is, it seems like this should be possible.

-------------------------

sat | 2024-08-30 08:23:00 UTC | #34

That is a lot of questions @Lorimer. Let me try to answer them.

[quote="Lorimer, post:32, topic:33981"]

This is indeed what we are doing. We are carefully evaluating various aspects though. Every decision has pros and cons and sometimes balancing pros and cons isn't straightforward. Blindly following all previous decisions is not the necessarily the best action in every situation IMHO. But we do give our best to follow adopted motion proposals, and to make course corrections when needed.

[/quote]

We have done such things in the past, and that's perfectly possible. However, from my experience it may happen that such nodes again move out of the subnet, e.g. when they become unhealthy, and then get added to some other subnets later on. So it's not a silver bullet, especially when there is no support in tooling for this. So rather than doing ad-hoc changes like this, I'd prefer if we make a change in the tooling.
To make this discussion more productive -- any suggestions how to do this?

[quote="Lorimer, post:32, topic:33981"]

Simple. We spend a ton of time answering questions in this forum instead of doing actual work. We have a very small team, and we already do a ton of things. Adding a link to the forum post is a fair amount of work and cannot be done quickly because: a) we use dre tool written in rust for submitting these proposals, and I haven't found yet a crate to talk to discourse API from rust, b) adding a link to the forum post, e.g. in the version elect proposals, is a three-step process (1) create a stub forum thread, (2) submit a proposal with a link to the stub forum thread, and (3) update the forum thread/post contents. Obviously can be done but it's work.
I'm now thinking if we could call python from rust (since there is a python client for discourse) or should we implement this client in rust.

In principle yes, although aggressively insisting that others take a particular action without considering their response and without providing sufficient evidence that the particular action *must* be taken *urgently* could be seen in other light ;) To be perfectly honest I'd appreciate *a bit more* considerate (less "catastrophic" view). But you did have great points, and made an outstanding analysis. So thank you!
As a result of that, we did find an important discrepancy between the dre tooling and the target topology, so I see that as a fantastic outcome. As a result, we will either update the dre tooling or submit another motion proposal, depending on the outcome of additional analysis that we will have to conduct to determine the potential impact of this change. To set expectations right, it will likely take a few weeks before we finish this and agree which changes need to be made. In the meantime we'll likely continue using the tooling as is.

[/quote]

SEV-SNP is not being used right now on the regular IC nodes, due to the subnet recovery challenges. This has been de-prioritized due to the estimated effort needed and unclear benefit (would everyone suddenly jump onto the IC if there was SEV-SNP? -- it's unclear). SEV-SNP will be used on Boundary Nodes, but I'm not sure what's the timeline for this. The information on whether node supports SEV-SNP [will be in the registry](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/dfinity/ic/-/blob/rs/protobuf/src/gen/registry/registry.node.v1.rs?L45) but AFAIK this field is not used yet.

In principle yes. We have all the necessary pieces. In practice, it's work. One would have to terminate all activities of the node in the subnet (wait for the next CUP, etc), then after the node is not used in the subnet anymore, prune all data on the node. Then add all data from the new subnet into the node (state sync, takes between a few minutes/hours and a few days, depending on the subnet size and the link speed), and then finally the node becomes an active and productive member.
So yes it can be done in theory. In practice it's something that needs development work. Would you like to help with this, to get your hands dirty?

Here is the command I ran (in case someone wonders):
> dre subnet replace --id uzr34-akd3s-xrdag-3ql62-ocgoh-ld2ao-tamcv-54e7j-krwgb-2gm4z-oqe -o 4 --motivation "aligning subnet decentralization with the target topology" --forum https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-uzr34-ii/33981

I also added support in the DRE tool to manually provide a link to the forum post. It's not ideal (better would probably be to create a new forum thread automatically), but it was easy. And hopefully it will be sufficient short term.
