I am planning to start a project that will probably take about a year to complete, and I'm looking at doing all the back-end programming in rust, as I'm more familiar with it. 

Most of the feedback and questions / examples / tutorials seem to be about motoko, on this forum at least. Is this something that should worry me? Going forward will the team support rust development / SDKs / etc, or will it gradually move towards motoko?

Thanks

Give that all the core canisters are written in Rust, I don't think you have anything to worry about. Probably less than if you'd use Motokoâ€¦
