Hello community,

@csolimano and I are excited to share the third milestone in our [open-source educational series](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education) on developing on the IC. **DFINITY Education** is an effort to help students get up-to-speed with IC development through the lens of traditional computer science concepts. These repos include several modules, and are meant to serve as the backbone for educators looking to build out their own computer science coursework offerings.

[This month's content](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education/data-structures) is centered around **data structures** in Motoko, how these data structures differ from conventional solutions on the IC, and how to think through their tradeoffs when developing your own canisters. Additionally, students will be able to leverage  **BigMap**  to serve as a scaleable backend to their API.We look forward to your questions and feedback.

Please don't hesitate to raise issues on the repos themselves.
