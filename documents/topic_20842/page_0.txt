Hello

I would like propose is it possible to have neuron controlled canister similar to ckBTC canisters for 
Ordinals canister.

All we need to do is run bitcoin full node and run ord from https://github.com/casey/ord

And aggregate the inscriptions into a canister. This is will very much needed for the ordinals community imo.
