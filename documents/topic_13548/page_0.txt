Why is the fee (10000dom) of NNN Ledger canister necessary?
Internet Computer is a reverse gas model so I thought the fee is not needed.
Is there perhaps a program that automatically compensates canister cycles from fee (ICP)?

I'm not 100% sure, but my guess would be that it is to prevent transaction spam. Since the ledger keeps its own blockchain of transactions, performing one transaction already requires a decent amount of work, so it makes sense to have a small cost associated.
