Programming in motoko with an actor model has brought up many questions on how to model not just data but applications as a whole. Does anyone know of any good resources to understand actor specific design patterns. Like when do you use a single versus multiple actors and how to think about a problem with this unique paradigm? A lot of resources that I've found have been very academic in nature vs more high level design patterns

I think it is absolutely okay to read about microservices. Canister model has a lot of similarities with this concept. And there is a lot of great literature about it.

A Google search for “erlang actor model” or “swift actors” has what I would consider some helpful resources but it’s hard to know if it’s what you’re looking for.

Perhaps this sort of thing?
