Seed round investor wish to unstake to dissolve：

CANISTER=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
RESULT="$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER manage_neuron "(record { id = opt record { id = $NEURON_ID:nat64 }; command = opt variant { Configure = record { operation = opt variant { StartDissolving = record {} } } } })" --output=raw)"
didc decode -t "(ManageNeuronResponse)" -d ~/Downloads/nns-ifaces-0.8.0/governance.did $RESULT

return Err:

(
record {
command = opt variant {
Error = record { error_message = ""; error_type = 6 : int32 }
};
},
)

What happened?

It looks like that neuron is already fully dissolved. You may want to move on to the “Disburse ICP from neurons that are fully dissolved” step, here:
[https://github.com/dfinity/docs/blob/master/modules/token-holders/pages/seed-donations.adoc#disburse-icp-from-neurons-that-are-fully-dissolved](https://github.com/dfinity/docs/blob/master/modules/token-holders/pages/seed-donations.adoc#disburse-icp-from-neurons-that-are-fully-dissolved)

@Ori is correct. For hints on error codes you can check the [code](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/024de2fc73d7f6f5df5a92edf9675851f9ebbf59/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L749). Error 6 is:

    ERROR_TYPE_REQUIRES_LOCKED = 6;
    // The neuron is not dissolving and the operation requires it to be
    // dissolving.

I almost getting the same error but then when I'm trying to dissolve a neuron. 

This is what I do and it was working before with a few other neuron's that I dissolved: 


```
CANISTER=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
RESULT="$(dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER manage_neuron "(record { id = opt record { id = $NEURON_ID:nat64 }; command = opt variant { Configure = record { operation = opt variant { StartDissolving = record {} } } } })" --output=raw)"
/usr/local/bin/didc/didc-linux64 decode -t "(ManageNeuronResponse)" -d ~/Downloads/nns-ifaces-0.8.0/governance.did $RESULT
```

```
And this is my error that I receive:
opt table2 <: opt Command_1 via special opt rule
(record { command = null })
```
Can someone point me in the good direction what to do?
And I'm a noob in bash :(

You’re using an older version of governance.did with didc in the last step. If you go here and click “view .did file” you can see the latest, you can copy the candid shown to your local governance.did file:
[Canlista: nns-governance/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/listing/nns-governance-10222/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai)

Assuming there were no errors returned by your dfx canister call then your neuron will actually be dissolving, the last line with the didc command just allows you to read the result, if you still have the RESULT variable stored you can re-run the didc command and it should decode it correctly.
