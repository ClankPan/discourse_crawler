Hello. I’d like to know how realistic it would be to recreate an Access db on Icp? This db is for a very specific QMS db for the processing of wire orders (metal wire that’s straightened and cut to spec, as well as other processes). I somehow figured out how to create it in access a couple of years ago, and I’d like to explore the idea of creating it on ICP blockchain. How realistic does that sound?
