I have been trying to find ICRC-1, ICRC-2 or ICRC-3 implementation of tokens in rust icp , specifically using the latest ic_cdk version higher than 0.11.0 .  Specifically i am trying to do the following...

1. Implementing a token standard in rust 
2. A canister accepting payment of the token standard which i made in rust .
3. A factory pattern such that a parent canister can create a token programmatically .

Here are some links that may be interesting:

- [DFINITY's ICRC ledger](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger). It supports ICRC-1 and 2, not sure about 3
- The [cycles ledger](https://github.com/dfinity/cycles-ledger). It supports ICRC-1, 2, and 3, plus some other functionality
- [Rust token transfer sample](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/tokens_transfer) and [Motoko ICRC-2 sample](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/icrc2-swap). By combining the two you should see how you can accept payments

I have noticed that Defi related things in ICP . is quite fragmented . There isn't a smooth developer on boarding to creating tokens , factory tokens or swaps.
