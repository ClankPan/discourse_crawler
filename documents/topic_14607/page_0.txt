Hello everyone!

As in the past two weeks there is a proposal out to elect a [new IC replica release](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/fd53b006b2186f9e077831ec73cdc0c07eaf6cc9) which enables replicas to run the Crypto Service Provider (CSP) into a separate process. To make sure this change does not affect the availability of the IC or introduce any regressions, the plan is to roll out this change to the subnets over the course of a few release cycles. Since the last weeks' releases were successful we aim to propose rolling it out to more subnets.

The proposal can found [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/73368).
Please do reach out if you have any questions about it.

All the best,
Andrea
