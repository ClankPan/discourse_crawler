Hi everyone,

I tried to build  and deploy Internet Identity locally as written here: https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity.

The build fails, and an error is thrown as follows. Does anyone know what I am missing?

```
error: failed to run custom build command for `wabt-sys v0.8.0`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/tmp/cargo-installAdGCBt/release/build/wabt-sys-4f936b85bd067f17/build-script-build` (exit code: 101)

I figured out. I need to install cmake.

```
sudo snap install cmake --classic

```

Somebody should add this to README on github, for people like me who know nothing about rust and its ecosystem.

cmake is a fairly standard tool for building out bin's etc - I say this, but I hit the same snag when I did it too so it's not uncommon. I think updating the readme with deps that aren't common on all systems, or just having a hail mary apt-get or something in the instructions. Glad you got it working, don't forget to use the npm script to run the frontend

I have the same problem. I'm trying to run the `sudo snap install cmake --classic` command on macOS and I'm getting the following message: `Interacting with snapd is not yet supported on darwin(macOS).
This command has been left available for documentation purposes only.` does anyone know a workaround for this or am I simply unable to run the Internet Identity repo locally on my mac?
