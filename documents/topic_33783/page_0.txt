Thanks for your support,
We are waiting it to be fixed.
And i have a question ,
once you fix this issue will it work for other?Because we have another canister which is bineded with domain and we also want to change that, we did't try to to change that because we were facing this issue with this. once it works we will change that also.

Yes, once we have a solution, registering domains across canisters will work.

Hey @Alishan, 

Sorry for the inconveniences caused. I am happy to report that the issue has been identified and fixed:
To make your custom domain work, you should first check its status with:
```
curl -sLv -X GET \
    https://icp0.io/registrations/REQUEST_ID
```
If it returns a status, it should show it as available. However, if it returns `not found`, then you can just start the registration again:
```
curl -sLv -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://icp0.io/registrations \
    --data @- <<EOF
{
    "name": "CUSTOM_DOMAIN"
}
EOF
```
And it should work again for you. If that's not the case, please post here again and we will investigate further.

Thanks you very much ðŸ’•. I hope it will work for other domain also.
