Hi, Is there any example for storage canister use like S3 in AWS?

Hi there, not really, as may have already guessed this works a bit different and as far as I know there not a solution already implemented for that, what you can do is have your data stored in a canister and query it.

Look at 
### Data Storage on ICP

ICP provides a variety of data storage options, including:

1. **Canisters**: Canisters are a type of smart contract that can be used to store and manage data on the ICP network. They can be thought of as a decentralized database.
2. **Storage canisters**: Storage canisters are a special type of canister that is optimized for storing and managing large amounts of data.
3. **File canisters**: File canisters are a type of canister that is optimized for storing and managing files, such as images and other binary data.
4. **NNS (Network Nervous System)**: NNS is a decentralized governance system on ICP that allows for the storage and management of data in a decentralized manner.
