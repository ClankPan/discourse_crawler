It looks like it's possible to mint NFTs with the same name/symbol as ones that already exist on chain. In order to avoid being scammed, do buyers/users have to verify the NFT was minted/created by a specific principal or container ID by looking at the on chain data? Sorry if it's a silly question, I'm just starting to dig deeper into NFTs on the IC. Thanks in advance for any help/advice!

I suppose this depends on the marketplace where you are buying/selling NFTs. I would expect them to have a process on how to deal with duplicate names.

From a security perspective, you should always verify as much as possible, especially if you are dealing with significant amounts of tokens
