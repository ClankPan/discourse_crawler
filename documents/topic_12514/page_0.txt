Hi all, I want to deploy the local canister and call the function from the canister which is deployed on the IC. So I run "icx-proxy --dns-alias 127.0.0.1:<canister_id>" in one terminal, and run "dfx deploy" in another terminal, then errors comes outs:
hyper::Error(
    Connect,
    ConnectError(
        "dns error",
        Custom {
            kind: Uncategorized,
            error: "failed to lookup address information: nodename nor servname provided, or not known",
        },
    ),
)
Now I know the parameter "--dns-alias" is important, so anyone knows how to config?
