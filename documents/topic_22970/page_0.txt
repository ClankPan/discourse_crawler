What about MetaMask Snap support for 34 non-EVM chains and no ICP? What are we doing, keeping up?

Any plans to bring FoxIC to MetaMask?

Iâ€™m building a snap based wallet currently. Should be ready soon, but snaps are in dev preview anyway.

Need code audit to pass the preview then we should discuss how to make it happen

This seems really promising.   Is there an existing project/repo/discussion area for this.  I'd love to join.
