Hello all: 

We are slowely beginning to roll our some of our flagship dapps, and with the advent of sneedlock 2.0 upon us we wanted to take the time to give a little update on what the DAO has been building.

This canister ^ currently allows liquidity positions from @ICPSwap to be controlled by the DAO. We are hoping that small and large development teams alike will feel comfortable utilizing this canister as an alternative to traditional blackholing methods. The main benefit to Sneedlock is the ability for fees from LP to be claimed, and for teams to use the sns governance model to take back possession of the lp position if they so choose. 

Over the coming months, improvements to sneedlock will be rolled out and displays of TVL will be published.

We encourage questions!

Also, in the works is a partnership with @fomowell to incorporate a sneed lock option into their wells. We are very much looking forward to working together.

This option will allow users to choose to send liquidity positions to the Dapp canister OK64 while allowing the trading to occur on @ICPEx replacing the blackhole canister address.

Wonderful work, friends! You helped us achieve one of our needed features, +1 to DeFi infrastructure in the IC ecosystem!

We also recommend that IC project teams use this feature. Amazing!

Thank you so much for all of your support and assistance. We hope you will be pleased with the interface as we roll it out. 

This was a large cumulative effort between many development teams over the last 7 months.
