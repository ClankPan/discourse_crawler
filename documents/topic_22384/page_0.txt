I want to use internet computer as a backend storage for ios mobile app development. Is there a rust API to use from ios app?

My research suggests that use agent to talk to internet computer. Does any developer have this experience and could share a similar project I could learn?

Thank you very much :)

I'm not sure if you can use a rust Agent in a Swift project, but here is a [list of Agents](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-internet-computer#client-libraries-agents) available for different host languages. Towards the end of the year we will also have a basic Swift Agent available for iOS developers :)
