Hi, fairly new here. 
I'm working as dev on a project (with recently our first Dfinity grant) and would like to R&D with the community a possible standard for storing and managing user data.

User data should be reusable across applications benefiting both developers and users. This will allow the ICP ecosystem not to fall in the same issues like web2 did where applications passively force users to stay on their platform.

There are multiple ways to create such standard like creating a hierarchical database, some custom social graph, etc... 
Tho, I would consider using an already existing Web Semantics standard supported by W3C. Using RDF/OWL we could create a standard for user data canisters that stores information using this technology. While also giving the user full access control to the canister so he/she has a variation of access options on each piece of information. 
This could allow cross ecosystem integration from networks that also use Web Semantics.
Users would have to pay for the upcost of their user data canister, but this shouldn't be a  lot, and applications that users use should be able to fund these for whatever reason they seem fit.

This feels like something that should be developed and agreed upon by the dev community imo. , any suggestions/critic/help is very welcome ^-^

I'll research this nonetheless since it's also a part of my future personal mission/project.

*Solid idea!  user data needs to stay local ...

Yeah I should have referenced that post, or is it better to close this one and continue on that other post? 

Doesn't seem like a lot is happening on the user data standard aspect. 
I'm curious about the solution that DSCVR has been building, but have not yet received a response to my email.
I do believe in the benefits of using a standard of standards like Bobbylingus said in the other post. And such could be RDF or OWL (OWL is kinda build on top of RDF) , or any other standard that fits this purpose better. 
I'm not hard set on using OWL, but it does open up way more possibilities as it extends way beyond the IC ecosystem.
There are just many technical possibilities that I'd like to test out. 
For example; maybe its possible to use existing OWL protocols/silo's like [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) to host user data pods like canisters on the IC, which would save a ton of work

After the Motoko bootcamp I'd like to create some sort of workgroup on some platform to actually R&D this with whoever is interested, with the main focus on creating something that the dev community actually wants to use, and thus should be easy enough to use.

OWL looks like it was last updated 15 years ago. Is this the 'state of the art' around this topic, or has it been superseded?

We have a [data API](https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft/blob/main/docs/specification.md#data-api) with permission and an extensible structure inside of the origyn_nft and I'd love to add a meta layer section that would allow developers to express what data is in their data apps.

Looking at something like solid, I could also see us being able to put some kind of solid endpoint into the the nft standard that would allow for self-sovereign and tradeable data collections(A subset of this being a solely owned(soul bound even) "pod" that is by definition a personal data wallet).

Please reach out as you move forward, we'd love to collaborate.

From what Iv seen and know they still are the basic building blocks for an ontology that then get used for knowledge graphs. I do not know anything more standard that is used by anything involving web semantics than that , maybe im missing something. 

The idea's you propose are certainly interesting, thanks and I'll definitely reach out :slight_smile:
