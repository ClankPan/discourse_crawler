CurrencyTomb is a tiny obsolete currency converter, built on Internet Computer Blockchain! I hope more people will be interested in ICP :slight_smile:

Is the code open-sourced?

Hi Jennifer 🙂 It’s not open-sourced. Do you think it’s beneficial to make it so?

Ah, I misinterpreted the intent of the application. It shows conversion rates. It does not convert currencies. 

I usually recommend finance applications to open-source since they deal with people's money. In your case, it is providing simple information so this is a business decision (though, I think open-sourcing code is always good!).

Ahh okay! This time the appreciation is really simple, but I’ll remember it for my next projects😁 Thank you! 🫡
