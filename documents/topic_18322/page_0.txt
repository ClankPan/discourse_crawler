I'm wondering how calls to the management-canister can be achieved from a local development environment... Is it, similar to internet identity, necessary to compile and deploy the management-canister locally to use it? Or is the idea to connect to the "real" productive management-canister on IC from local?

Background of the question is that we want to test locally the creation of new canisters from an existing canister...

Any hint is appreciated :slight_smile:

The management canister is a virtual canister - it isn't really there, the replicas just interpret those calls the right way. Therefore you don't have to install it. It's part of the runtime so to speak.

[Here's an example](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/basic_bitcoin/src/basic_bitcoin/src/BitcoinApi.mo#L25-L32) how to use it. Just define the functions you need. Just copy the parts that are relevant to you from the full [management canister interface definition](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-candid)

Great, thank you! We're using Rust, I'll try to adopt and try it out asap

In that case you probably want to use [these functions](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/management_canister/main/index.html)
