Obviously it is required if a node in a subnet crashes and comes back up. While persisted is the share encrypted? If so, what is the encryption key that is used for this encryption?

The shares are persisted in a keystore file on the local node. This keystore file is currently not explicitly encrypted, but it is stored on a volume encrypted using dm-crypt.
