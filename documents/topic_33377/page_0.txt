DeTrash incentivises sustainable waste management with the help of the RECY network and the cRECY tokens. Since we are integrating to the IC, we believe our ESG assets can be offered alongside what IC Footprint offers currently. Our assets are locked by companies to activate their ESG certifications and we are soon to cross over 50k recyclers in our network. 

We would love to bring the IC's functionalities into our products and in return, partner with the IC community to distribute our novel digital ESG assets.
