I'm trying to raise `--max-stable-pages` to 96 GiB and want to use `--incremental-gc` for a child canister. How do I do it with Motoko:
```
Cycles.add(2 * TRILLIONS);
let canister_actor = await External.Canister();
```

Unfortunately, there is no way to vary the compiler flags between main actor an any imported actor class. However, in this case, why don't you just apply the same compiler settings to the main actor. I don't think it would hurt.

hi Claudio, so any compiler flags applied to the main canister, will be applied to the child canisters as well? if so, that should be enough for me.

Yes, that's correct.
