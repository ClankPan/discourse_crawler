I created a canister using nns and set the cycle, but I cannot view its subnet information.
[https://ic.rocks/principal/75eyx-eyaaa-aaaaj-aabgq-cai](https://ic.rocks/principal/75eyx-eyaaa-aaaaj-aabgq-cai)

And when I try to deploy the project, it prompts me
```
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content: <html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.19.10</center>
</body>
```

To deploy, make sure you use the `--network ic` flag!
So to deploy a local project to the IC you would run
```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

If you've created a canister with the NNS, you've probably set your local principal as a controller.

If this is the case, you can use the following to deploy:
```
dfx deploy --network=ic --no-wallet
```
