Can someone explain the current situation with the ICP and ckBTC ledgers? Do they have different candid interfaces? I know they both support ICRC-1, but it seems like the rest of the functionality could be different, such as ICP having `query_blocks` and ckBTC having `get_transactions`.

I think these are the current latest ledger dids:

ICP: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/rosetta-api/icp_ledger/ledger.did
ckBTC: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did

My understanding is that the ICRC-1 standard has been developed for ICP at the top of the existing ICP ledger. That's why the ICP ledger exposes both existing features (e.g. `query_blocks`) and ICRC-1 features (e.g. `icrc1_xxxxx`).

The ckBTC ledger, as the Snses ledger, uses another canister code that have been developed from scratch (I think) and which implements "only" the ICRC-1 features (e.g. `icrc1_xxxxx`).

Does this answer your question? If not, can forward it further to the team.

That said, just noticed that `get_transactions` and `get_blocks` have been added to ICRC-1 candid files. So will forward your question.

Hi @lastmjs,
Yes I can explain. What you are seeing is the result of two actions: consolidation of the did files into one per canister and the lack of ICRC-3, which is a standard way to access the transaction log.

The consolidation of did files happened with [3a207e](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/3a207ef2996c4960f7af86e97210b2cdb8ef9d7d). Before that we had several files per ledger. Specifically we had one file for the standard endpoints and one for the non-standard ones. The reason why we had to move away from having multiple files is that we can attach only one file to a canister and this file should have all the public endpoints. That's why we had to consolidate them and that's why you are seeing a single file with a mixture of standard and non-standard endpoint. This shouldn't be a problem because the standard endpoints are prefixed with `icrc*_`.

About the standards themselves, both ledgers support ICRC-1 and will support ICRC-2 but only ckBTC ledger can support ICRC-3. [ICRC-3 is still under development](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icrc-3-discussion/20167) and because of this it cannot be supported yet. Still, the ckBTC ledger needs a way to access the the transaction log right now and cannot wait for ICRC-3. Therefore:

1. The ICP ledger has a custom endpoint called `query_blocks` which returns its blocks. This endpoint is unique to the ICP ledger and it exists only because of account identifiers which are not compatible with ICRC-1
2. The ckBTC ledger needs a way to fetch blocks and transactions while we are waiting for ICRC-3. Therefore two endpoints called `get_blocks` and `get_transactions` have been added. These two endpoints are shaped around the proposal for ICRC-3 (but may very well end up being incompatible with it).

I hope this clarifies the changes to the repository. Happy to clarify more if needed.
