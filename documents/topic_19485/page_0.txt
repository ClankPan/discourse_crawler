## Bitcoin x IC Hackathon: BUIDL Bitcoin!

Thereâ€™s a new Hackathon happening, brought to you by Encode Club. This is a chance to build really cool Bitcoin related projects on the IC using the newly fully released ckBTC feature! They also have a Blue Skies track for non-bitcoin related projects.

The Hackathon lasts about a month and will offer various prizes based on placings. Check out the official announcement from Encode Club at this link:
