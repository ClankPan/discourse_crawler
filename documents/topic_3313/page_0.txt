Hi,

EDIT: NOW WORKING closed all apps rebooted iPhone and damn it worked the old "Have you tried turn it off and on" Chrome and Firefox still are a problem though.

I am currently having issues loading https://nns.ic0.app on iPhone Safari latest version. It just keep's reloading over and over...

If I try the same URL on the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox my iPhone it goes to step2 https://identity.ic0.app/#authorize but tells me my browser isn't supported!

If I try my windows PC there are no worries it works fine. I just don't have a identity USB key to continue.

Are there known issues currently? I have tried another iPhone and having the same issues. Is there a status page that can show me outages?

Cheers

Same here but on Windows 10, this thing does not work anywhwere I tried Mozilla, Chrome and Opera.

I get error 500, hope that helps.

A bit worrying to see a link from Dominic's Twitter not functioning.

I finally got my backup old finger print iPhone working had to update to the latest iOS version that’s for sure. Still only seems to work on safari.

Things seems a little buggy at the moment, hopefully it all gets ironed out rapidly. Can’t have stupid bugs getting in the way of rapid adoption.
