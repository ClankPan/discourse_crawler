Hello ICP Developer Forum Fam! 

ICPJesse here, cohost of [Neurotic Podcast](https://neuroticpod.com) with the irreplaceable @Kyle_Langham. We're planning a special end of year Neurotic Podcast episode and looking for you ðŸ«µ to be a part of it! 

Please record a 1-3min MP3 of yourself (via voice memos on your phone works great!) about your Internet Computer Resolutions for next year â€“ it can be what you want to build, what you want to celebrate, what youâ€™re looking forward to for the ICP in 2023. It's a broad prompt by design for you to make your own. Last day to upload Dec 25th. [Introduce yourself, say your piece and upload your MP3 file here to be a part of the show](https://tinyurl.com/neuroticnewyears)!

An audio description and additional notes about the special can be found on the latest episode of Neurotic released today (Also covers SNS-1 updates, DSCVR voting features, BTC Integration, ntangle, wApps and Netflix's Wednesday)
