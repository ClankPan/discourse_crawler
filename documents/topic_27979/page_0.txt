Hello Dfinity Community,

My name is `[Timur Rakhimzhan](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Timur_Rakhimzhan)`. I am reaching out to propose the establishment of the first Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) node provider in Kazakhstan, aiming to extend the network's reach not only within the country but also across the whole Central Asia. As a dedicated software developer with a profound passion for cryptocurrency and decentralization, I believe that expanding the ICP network into this uncharted territory holds immense potential for both the local tech communities and the broader Dfinity ecosystem.

Best regards,
Timur Rakhimzhan

Dear All,

I hope this message finds you all in good health. I am writing to formally register as a Node Provider under Timur Rakhimzhan identity. I would like to add nodes in Kazakhstan. I'll start with one node, but have plans to add more nodes if the first one will be launched successfully.

You can find my new proposal to join the network by clicking on this link: `[Proposal Link](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128106)`

My self-declaration documents are also uploaded to the Internet Computer Wiki under `[Timur Rakhimzhan](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Timur_Rakhimzhan)`. In addition to this, you can check my `[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timur-rakhimzhan-2716711b7/)`.

Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am grateful for your support and votes in favor of accepting my proposal!

Best regards,
Timur Rakhimzhan

Hi @timurrakhimzhan thanks for joining the IC community and looking forward to your participation! There is a separate forum thread where Node Providers introduce themselves and give update on their activities, I suggest you repost your message as well in this [Forum thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643). 

Please note that the IC network currently has reached so called "target topology" so currently the community has decided that no additional node machines are required, but this of course can change with the further growth of the IC network.
