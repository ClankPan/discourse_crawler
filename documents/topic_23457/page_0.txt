Hey everybody :wave:  

I wanted to create something fun for the ecosystem so I created a twitter/X account controlled by a canister. You can create and vote on tweet proposals at 

[https://johndao.gg](https://johndao.gg) `

All voting takes place on the IC and at the end of the 12 hours round the winning tweet gets posted and the winner gets to claim an ICP. You can see the payouts happening [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/484113beba3b89b16cc21c3e4a5c62375532a837536d6785381147d93ccced0f) 

So if you want to earn some ICP come over to [johndao.gg](https://johndao.gg). Otherwise you can simply follow along at Twitter/X with what the community comes up by following https://twitter.com/JohnDao_gg

If you have any questions or want to contribute feel free to join [our telegram](https://t.co/dH8WBxoy9P)

Love it :slight_smile: 

It'd be cool if you could share a bit about the technical architecture/implementation.
