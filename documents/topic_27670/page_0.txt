I am curious about it. Since the source code is about 40k lines of rust code. If got any guide article will be great .

You can refer to the [Command Line Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/) which explains how each `dfx` command works. 

If you reference the specific command source code, I suggest the following in the [SDK source code](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk).

1. You can view each command source code: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/bf7322741520f31a4d3484e391dbfc359829ef43/src/dfx/src/commands

Each command code file should have some comments that help with understanding how things work.

2. You can also see a list of modules that correspond to each command in the module declaration: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/bf7322741520f31a4d3484e391dbfc359829ef43/src/dfx/src/commands/mod.rs#L23

Is there something specific that you are looking for?
