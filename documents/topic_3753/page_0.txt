very new to this platform.  my question is how-to setup development with new live beta-network? I have icps in new wallet ... can see credits and debits fine. just not sure how to link these accounts. docs in quickstart seem  dated.

Hello @der0pa,

Currently there are no subnets for public app deployment available. As the network is still bootstrapping application subnets will be rolled out in the coming weeks. In the meantime you can work on your projects by building and deploying locally. 

The local quickstart here would be the one to follow for this: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html
