V0.6.13 of the SDK is now available for download!

The 0.6.13 release primarily includes internal enhancements and fixes, and updates to the supported version of Motoko and the Motoko base library.

The only user-visible new feature in this release is the ability to **set the default compute and memory allocation** settings for a project using the `dfx.json` configuration file.

Note that, although this release includes support for specifying the default compute and memory allocation settings in the dfx.json file, these keys are not exposed in the dfx.json template by default.
