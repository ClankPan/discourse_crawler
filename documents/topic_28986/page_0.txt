Hello everyone, if you are planning to participate please do recall that it starts on April 9th (three days from the time I'm writing this).

Online participating is possible, as well as in-person...


*I'm happy to announce that the following Internet Computer hackathon (Oxford University, April 9-11) is open to everyone, including online participants.*

*This hackathon has two tracks. You can compete in either, or both (prizes are awarded for both tracks):*

**Track 1:**    AI (Artificial Intelligence)

**Track 2:**    DeCom (Decentralized Commerce)

*Details and sign-up are online at the official Oxford hackathon page:*

*As always, please feel free to participate or share with others that you think would like to compete but do note that April 8th is the last day to sign up.*

*Regards,*
*Aaron*
