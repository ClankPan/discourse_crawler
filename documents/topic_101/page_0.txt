hey everyone,
i’m moritz, a berlin based computer science student. i’ve been with dfinity since early 2018 as a community organizer. i’ve been eagerly waiting for the sdk and i’m super happy that it’s finally out now and we all can play around with it. i’m also excited about this new place for us to interact with each other, i think discourse is a great platform. i have little experience in functional programming or the actor model, which is what i‘m currently learning. if you have any question or problems feel free to reach out!

Hello DFINITY colleagues, I'm currently living in Hamburg. Got to know about the project on Twitter, as people seems to be getting excited about it. 
And exciting it is!
Looking forward to see it happen, with all the good benefits that's going to bring.
