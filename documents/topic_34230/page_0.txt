I just finished watching a podcast from [Sin City Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/live/XPIGFN3wsQY?si=15P1y4xF9RXfC6pr).  There was a Dfinity person on there that was asked directly about how ICP is better than other chains, including Cardano specifically (at the 39:30 minute mark).  That representative gave a response that made me cringe and seemed to even surprise some of the hosts.  The response or non-response to the question was a big missed opportunity to show how ICP stands out, and to me it left the effect that other blockchains are on par with ICP.  Given this egalitarian response, I would think that the same response would be given for a question comparing Dogecoin and ICP when clearly ICP is far superior.

**I'd like to get the response of others here on how ICP should be represented or if this egalitarian approach is good or not.**  I personally see it as a problem if ICP is being marketed as such.  That's not to say that ICP supporters should walk around with their noses in the air but we also can't shy away from bringing up the areas where ICP is miles ahead of other projects.  Other projects are certainly not shy about hyping themselves up that way.

It is my view that the pro-ICP crowd, including those with Dfinity, should already be able to discuss why and how ICP is better than other blockchains, how it is unique, etc.  Messaging is also marketing!

I think something like this would go good with Dominic's 40 second ICP pitch challenge.

Here's my response if asked about how ICP stands out:
> ICP is better because it enables blockchain tech to be used as a full stack tech solution w/out reliance on Web2.  That allows for Ai, games, NFT, and virtually any other dapp to be stored and run completely on chain.

*Everyone is free to use it, improve on it, etc!
