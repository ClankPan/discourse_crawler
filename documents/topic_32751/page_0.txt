For some reason, dfx refuses to clean the state and I cannot reinstall the canisters - i.e. I end up with canisters that are not found.

In a terminal:

```
❯ sudo rm -r .dfx
❯ dfx start --clean
Running dfx start for version 0.20.0
Using project-specific network 'local' defined in /Users/daviddalbusco/projects/opensource/proposals.network/dfx.json
Initialized replica.

```

In another terminal

```
❯ dfx deploy internet_identity

❯ dfx canister call internet_identity init_salt

   }
]

  The replica returned a rejection error: reject code DestinationInvalid, reject message Canister qhbym-qaaaa-aaaaa-aaafq-cai not found, error code Some("IC0301")
```

As you can notice in the last error message, the canister is **not found**. I don't think it's related to candid, I got the similar issue for any canisters.

What's the issue again?

Anyone has an idea?

```
❯ dfx deploy internet_identity

Adding a specific canister ID to deploy a canister locally leads to the error - i.e. leads to not being able to deploy any canister locally anymore.

```
"satellite": {
			"candid": "candid/satellite.did",
			"type": "custom",
			"wasm": "https://github.com/junobuild/juno/releases/download/v0.0.30/satellite-v0.0.17.wasm.gz",
			"remote": {
				"id": {
					"ic": "gz2uc-6yaaa-aaaal-adgyq-cai",
					"local": "jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai" // <--- adding this line
				}
			}
		}
```

Removing that line of configuration and deploying the canister manually with a `--specified-id` parameter resolved the issue. What a waste of time.

Specifying an entry in the "remote" section tells dfx not to deploy the canister on that network (no matter what the network is).

If you're looking for an equivalent to the `--specified-id` parameter, but specified in dfx.json, try this:

```
"satellite": {
			"candid": "candid/satellite.did",
			"type": "custom",
			"wasm": "https://github.com/junobuild/juno/releases/download/v0.0.30/satellite-v0.0.17.wasm.gz",
			"remote": {
				"id": {
					"ic": "gz2uc-6yaaa-aaaal-adgyq-cai"
				}
			},
			"specified_id": "jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai"
		}
```
