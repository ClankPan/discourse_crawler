I'm an entrepreneur on IC. We are in the development phase of a project named KonectA, KonectA Is a decentralized platform that connects content creators and professionals from various fields with their respective consumers through Events in their calendars, offering a novel way to manage content. 
KonectA WebApp will be a DAO developed  and hosted 100% on-chain on the Internet Computer Protocol.
Right now we have an engineer as a consultant who has helped us  with the technical roadmap And he will be in charge of doing the interview. I would like some ic senior developer backend specialized in motoko/rust from you to help us technically put KonectA on track with the MVP and it would be good to be guided in other aspects, So the experience in entrepreneurship and start-up management will be valued . I offer up to  $2000 per month And the possibility of being a co-founder with a x % of. shares. Interested in private. 

Thanks very much.
Best Regards 
Alejandro

Hello, I'm Sagar, an experienced IC professional with a solid track record of **two years** in the industry. I have collaborated with esteemed clients such as Toniqlab and Modclub Inc., among others.

My journey has led me to the development of an innovative auto-upgradable architecture in Motoko, empowering us to support various operations such as field indexing, addition, and removal, as well as the creation and deletion of new models. 

 Additionally, we've successfully designed an Auto Top-Up Cycle tool, which currently offers an impressive more than 2.5X CYCLES compared to NNS. 

**Experience on ICP**

1. **Toniq Lab** Entrepot : Self-Minting Tool : https://xqbgo-kqaaa-aaaad-qdb6a-cai.raw.ic0.app/
2. **Cygnus** : AutoTop up Cycles: Which offer 2.5x Cycles: https://topge-siaaa-aaaai-qns6a-cai.ic0.app/
3. **ModClub**: Worked with their team and helped to build many features on their platform
4. **NoSQL DB** : Develop an innovative auto-upgradable architecture in Motoko, empowering us to support various operations such as field indexing, addition, and removal, as well as the creation and deletion of new models.

The main distinguishing factor is the Motoko Code architecture (Point 4). I have already developed it and it's prepared for use in any project. This will prove beneficial in the long run, save significant time, and provide a scalable foundation.

I am eager to establish connections and explore fresh opportunities with like-minded individuals.

Let's connect and discuss how we can mutually benefit from each other's expertise and ideas.

Thanks & Regards,
Sagar
