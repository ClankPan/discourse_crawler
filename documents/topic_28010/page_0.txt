Hello

After installing the android software update, when trying to log in to NNS as usual, there is a error saying: no passkey available , there are no passkeys on this device for identity.ic0.app. ~

Is it possible for a android software update to erase something important as a passkey that is stored in the TPM chip? Did several software updates before and it never caused any problems.

Strangely it works again after a hard factory reset.
Seemed to be a problem after installing the latest android software update.

Same thing happend a bit over half a year ago. 

Solved & could be deledet.

Can you please confirm that after doing a hard reset of your device, the passkey that was previously unavailable becomes available to enable you to connect to II?

Yes i confirm that the passkey that was previously unavailable after performing the android software update became available to enable me to connect to II, after doing a hard factory reset (i even did the hard factory reset twice in a row, with pressing the volume up key, home key method). 

Half a year ago i did the same, hard factory reset and was wondering why the II was still working.
With android device.

What type of Android device/model manufacturer and OS version are you using?

Samsung S22 , One UI-Version 6.0

Also wiped cache partition before the factory reset.

@Ang 

Today i tried to log in again and it did not work and gave the same error, no passkey available.
There must be a problem with the latest software update somehow. Very strange, wish i never updated.
