I use the famous workaround to generate automatically the did files from Rust code (see for example [here](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/ad3c386db8987ab4a79f194fe103b460a4168b12/src/satellite/src/lib.rs#L525) in Juno).

After upgrading to last `ic-cdk = "0.10.0"` and `candid = "0.9.1"`, I get following error when I generate the types. Any cluse what's the issue?

We changed the way to define function types.

Following code in `ic-cdk` might help you:

Still got one issue but, almost there. As soon as I got the solution will clean it and share it properly.

Finally, I've managed to solve all the issues thanks to the help provided by @lwshang and @chenyan (üôè). If anyone else is interested in migrating the `ic_cdk` to latest version while still generating the Candid files automatically for the Rust code, I've documented my entire migration process in the form of a blog post. Check it out!
