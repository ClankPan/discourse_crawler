ðŸš€ As a fun showcase, I built a hand-drawn like diagrams sketching dapp on the IC with Juno over the weekend.

It implements hosting with a custom domain, user authentication, data persistence, and file storage on the IC.

Give it a try yourself: :point_right: [https://icdraw.com](https://icdraw.com)

For those interested in the code, the project is, of course, open source: :point_right: [https://github.com/peterpeterparker/icdraw](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/icdraw)

Noice :grinning: pretty useful for demo. Will use this on the 28, just maybe a powered by IC logo somewhere ?

It was also useful to "dogfood" Juno usage in Web Workers. It helped me discover and resolve an issue and I can say now that it works like a charm in that context too. ðŸ˜ƒ
