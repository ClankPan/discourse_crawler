Good day, 

I recently tried disbursing a neuron with enough maturity for some ICP. I idled too long in the confirmation step and it failed however upon attempting a second time I received the attached error stating worst case maturity modulation was preventing disbursement.

What is worst case maturity modulation, how has it prevented me from disbursing the ICP I've accumulated and how do I now go about claiming these rewards?

You need a minimum of 1 ICP to spawn a neuron. The error message you received means that based on the maturity you are spawning and the "worst case" maturity modulation (i.e., -5%), it's possible that spawning would result in less than 1 ICP. For example, if you are attempting to spawn exactly 1 maturity, worst case maturity modulation of -5% would result in 0.95 ICP, so you would be unable to spawn.

That message is rather cryptic and should be improved.

The bottom line is, you need to spawn at least 1.06 maturity (1.06 maturity * 0.95 worst-case modulation = 1.007 ICP).
