I am thrilled to introduce my new project üëâ [Juno](https://juno.build/)

Juno is a unique open-source platform that makes building Web3 applications on the IC more accessible for the frontend developers üöÄ

No backend code is required. No new patterns to learn. Only JavaScript code like its Web2.

I'm starting with a closed beta program today. Contact me for an invitation code üëã.

[Retweet](https://twitter.com/daviddalbusco/status/1625519591173636097), share and ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno) are also much appreciated.

To infinity and beyond!

I love the simplicity here of the apis.  Really cool stuff. I'll be excited to see some of the initial use cases!

Thanks, glad to hear that!

As super early initial use case you can count the website which is deployed through Juno and, also the form (https://jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai.ic0.app/) I built for the sign-up to the beta üòÑ

No more invitation codes needed! [Juno](https://juno.build) is now open for any developer üî•

Also, there is a new landing page üë®‚Äçüé®

Juno turns one today‚Äîwhat a fun journey! üç∞ü•≥

Reflecting on the announcement, it's interesting to notice how, although it is still designed to operate without backend code, developers can now enhance its capabilities with [Serverless Functions](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/juno-serverless-blockchain-functions/27460). :crazy_face:

Eager to see what the next year brings!

Thanks üéâ!

A no-code website builder is not really in Juno's plan, but I would welcome an initiative that uses Juno as an infrastructure for this purpose.

That said, the community is "pushing" to add some sort of additional showcase/feature to deploy something easily. We are probably going to realize this (once an II limitation is lifted), but not further.

I personally think it would require too much effort and investment to build a super slick no-code builder that could compete with giants like WordPress, Webflow, and others, but again, I welcome any project willing to do so!

Something like a Web3 Wix would be an amazing asset to have in the ICP ecosystem! Imagine the userbase that would be attracted knowing the front end could be built off of a template leveraging the IC. Massive!

To speak frankly, I'm not convinced that the ability to build the frontend off-chain is a compelling enough unique selling proposition to outperform established cash cows. A no-code website builder sounds like nice idea but, realistically, would require quite a significant investment with a risk of remaining niche markets. However, I would be really happy to be proven wrong.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-02-18 20:50:39 UTC | #12

It is not necessary for the no-code website builder to outperform its off-chain competitors. Instead, it should provide a viable alternative to more centralized options. This argument can be applied to any blockchain-related project, but it is still worth pursuing. If the value proposition of the Internet Computer is to build on-chain systems, then a no-code website builder is a logical choice for a proof of concept. Dfinity should consider funding this project to demonstrate the capabilities of the IC.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-02-18 20:54:51 UTC | #13

I definitely would like to see some other third parties build it. I understand that you may not have the bandwidth or financial means to build something like that. That's why I advocate for a third party or dfinity to provide a grant for it.
