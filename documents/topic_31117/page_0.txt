[Proposal 130081 ](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=130081) to upgrade the NNS dapp just went live, please consider voting. :ballot_box:

This is the first of two proposals to support ckUSDC in the NNS dapp. If adopted, and mainnet testing goes well, we will propose to enable ckUSDC on the NNS dapp in a follow-up proposal.

Wasm sha256 hash: `e4f6dcc7c8718b4e4999ea30d2e3dc6d6ec9f0617e4d1ed6423f336fa1e5ad6a` (`https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/actions/runs/9208711458`)

## Change Log

### Added

* Get `ckUSDC` canister IDs from environment/configuration.

### Changed

* Set `Actionable Proposals` as the default selection.

### Removed

* Stop writing account transactions to stable memory.

### Fixed

* Rendering tokens with fewer than 8 decimals.
* Don't allow inputting more decimals than the token supports.

### Security

* Downgrade to Rust `1.77.2`.

### Not Published

* Support `ckUSDC` behind a feature flag.

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the [nns-dapp repo](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp):

```
git fetch  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout "87df24860d5946de9117139c0b5515c77c754a12"
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD main && echo "OK" || echo "Commit is not on main branch!"
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm.gz
```

You may also want to verify the canister arguments. In the proposal they are binary, which is not very readable. Docker provides both binary and text formats and you can verify that the text format corresponds to the binary `arg_hex` field in the proposal.

```
cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did
didc encode "$(cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did)"
```
