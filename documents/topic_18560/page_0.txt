Nice catch. üëç Are you using Firefox?

I can reproduce it with Firefox only, Safari and Chrome are fine. Looks like the height is not properly computed once the node attached to the DOM.

I use chrome and laptop screen with 125% zoom in win11.
The resolution is 1920x1080.

If I change the screen to 100% size, it is normal, but it is too small for the laptop screen. I usually use (also recommended by the system) 125%.

Ah cool to know, thanks for the feedback.

I just tested locally (I'm on Mac) the 125% zoom with Chrome and the fix. Result was ok, therefore I would say the fix does definitely looks good.

Please let me know once next version proposal is executed if it would not be the case.
