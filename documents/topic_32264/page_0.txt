Syron is a USD-pegged stablecoin, overcollateralized with Bitcoin and powered by Chain Fusion. It is designed to provide greater interoperability, stability, security, and decentralization within the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. Syron USD targets users seeking a stable digital asset for transactions and savings, addressing the need for a reliable and decentralized stablecoin. Its permissionless design allows any Bitcoin wallet to create a Safety Deposit Box (SDB) to deposit BTC, withdraw SUSD, and liquidate other accounts at risk. This enables users to become their own bank, taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities and increasing the capital efficiency of their BTC holdings by letting their BTC grow while gaining access to SUSD liquidity.

# Project Highlights

## What specific problems or needs does Syron USD address for its target users?

Syron USD addresses the issue of inflation, particularly in Latin America, where fiat currencies are constantly devalued. It brings stability to emerging markets and provides financial opportunities for DeFi enthusiasts.

## Are there any particular user stories or scenarios that highlight the benefits of Syron?

In Argentina, people often buy USD on the streets due to the devaluation of their local currency. The adoption of crypto dollars is high, with more and more people interested in saving in crypto dollars. Syron USD offers a stable and secure alternative for these users, allowing them to protect their savings from inflation and participate in the DeFi ecosystem.

# Web3 Advantages

Syron USD stands out from traditional financial systems by leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced security and transparency. Syron operates on decentralized networks, ensuring users maintain control over their assets. Its open-source nature and Bitcoin-native BRC-20 token format further distinguish it from Web2 financial projects, providing seamless interoperability and integration within the Bitcoin network.

SUSD allows users to leverage their BTC holdings for additional financial opportunities without selling their assets. Users can participate in liquidations, earning profits from accounts at risk. This creates an efficient use of capital, letting users grow their BTC holdings while accessing SUSD liquidity. The decentralized nature of Syron ensures transparency, security, and user empowerment.

# How is it Built

Syron is developed using a combination of advanced blockchain technologies and protocols, including:

* **Languages**: Rust for smart contract development and JavaScript/TypeScript for the front end in React.
* **Frameworks**: Chain Fusion for cryptographic and blockchain integrations.
* **Open Source Software**:
  * IC fork to leverage ckBTC for kickstarting the project.
  * Canister code available on GitHub.
  * Tyron Indexer as a gateway with Next.js API Routes.
* **3rd Party Services**:
  * UniSat as the Bitcoin wallet of choice, but compatible with any Bitcoin-native wallet.
  * Firebase for backend services.

# Internet Computer Superpowers

Several unique features of the Internet Computer made Syron possible and enhanced its development:

* **Chain Fusion**: Utilizing chain-key cryptography ensures secure and decentralized management of SDBs.
* **HTTPS Outcalls**: Enabled efficient indexing of BRC-20 data needed for verifying operations.
* **Exchange Rate Canister**: Provides decentralized and reliable BTC price data, avoiding the problem of centralized oracles.

# Go-To-Market Strategy

We are preparing for an incentivized testnet campaign on Bitcoin as soon as Signet support is ready (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/bitcoin-signet-support/29845). We also invite people to join our community on Telegram at [t.me/tyrondao](https://t.me/TyronDAO) and to sign up for our waitlist at [TyronDAO.org](https://tyrondao.org/).

# Monetization

Syron is designed to be a sustainable project with potential monetization strategies including:

* **Transaction Fees**: Small fees on stablecoin operations, such as liquidation.
* **Decentralized Governance**: Future plans to launch an SNS for TyronDAO, enabling decentralized governance for decision-making.

# Status of the Project

We have made significant progress:

* **Technical Milestones**: Implemented minting, burning, and liquidation of SUSD; developed as a BRC-20 token; deployed Tyron Indexer and Syron ledgers.
* **User Engagement**: Nearly 2,000 signups on our waitlist and over 6,000 unique visitors to our app in the last month.

# Future Plans

Our next steps include:

* **Support for Bitcoin Runes**: Integrating the new fungible token standard on Bitcoin for a better user experience.
* **Threshold Schnorr on ICP**: Enhancing the management of BRC-20 tokens and allowing the Syron canister to handle transfer-inscription independently, providing a more detailed experience for burning SUSD and redeeming BTC.
