## VFANS: A Decentralized Content Platform with IC Integration

This forum post describes VFANS, a content platform focused on creator collaboration, user ownership, and transparency. Here are the key takeaways:

**What is VFANS?**

* A decentralized content platform for publishing video/articles and subscribing through mobile payments.
* Offers a familiar Web2 user experience with future features like instant messaging.
* Distributes platform ownership (VFTs) to creators and users based on contributions.
* VFTs **grant** users the ability to receive income, vote on platform rules, and transfer ownership on-chain.

**Integration with Internet Computer (IC):**

* VFANS is integrating its VFT system with IC to create Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) based on ICRC-7 NFT as on-chain accounts.
* SBTs are non-transferable tokens that mirror a user's off-chain account, reflecting asset ownership and records.
* This is a first step towards further IC integration, including VFT transfer, governance voting, and a reputation system.

**How it's Built:**

* The IC integration is built primarily using Motoko, utilizeing Internet Identity, ICRC-7 standard, and Http outcalls.
* Users create VFANS accounts with their phone number, but Internet Identity is required for obtaining SBTs and on-chain storage. Oauth2 authentication is used to link Internet Identity with VFANS account id.
* SBTs follow the ICRC-7 NFT standard with disabled transfer to ensure a unique SBT per user.
* Utilized stable memory instead of database to store rich data including membership info, VFT ownership, and future interaction data.
* Http outcalls with digital signatures ensure secure data synchronization between off-chain accounts and SBT canisters.
* Embeded cycles meter to monitor balance of cycles and daily usage.

**Advantages of Internet Computer:**

* IC offers flexibility and scalability for SBT/NFT functions like fungible token transfer, reputation scores, and voting records.
* IC supports hybrid on-chain and off-chain systems well.

**Project Progress:**

* As of early 2024, VFANS has 3000+ registered users and 100+ creators.
* Based on creator feedback, they're improving web publishing and developing on-chain services.

**Future Plans:**

* The next project will add VFT transfer, governance, and reputation functionalities to SBTs, enabling user interaction on IC.

Overall, VFANS is a promising platform leveraging IC to empower creators and users in a transparent content ecosystem.
