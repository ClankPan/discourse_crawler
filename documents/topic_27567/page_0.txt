Hello DFINITY people!

My [latest NNS proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127703) to change the description of my known neuron failed, so I want to ask your professional opinion on these issue.

What exactly failed?
What can I do to prevent the execution failed next time?
What could I have done better overall?

Thank you in advance for your feedback!

Hello @krzysztofzelazko, here's a way to find out the failure reason:

```
$ dfx canister --network ic call "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai" --candid governance.did get_proposal_info "( 127703 : nat64 )" | grep error_message
error_message = "The name Krzysztof Å»elazko already belongs to a Neuron";
```

"rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai" is the ID of the NNS Governance canister. 

governance.did should be taken from [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/governance/canister/governance.did).

Once could also [use the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai) to perform this call.

Okay, so as I understand it, changing the description is only possible when changing the name at the same time. I will think about it :thinking:

Thank you :smiley:

Is it possible to modify the description while keeping the neuron's name unchanged? We prefer not to alter the neuron's name, but we need to update the description. Is it feasible to leave the name field empty while updating the description?
