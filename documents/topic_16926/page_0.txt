Tonite’s sns1 sale is a disaster. The nns subnet is overloaded with query calls which causes 3000 sns1 token sale to span 1 hour. This is equivalent to 1 tps. We need to allow community to host full nodes to offload the query calls while the consensus nodes should only handle update calls

AFAIK the IC doesn’t have a distinction between “full nodes” and “consensus nodes”.

@diegop, would you mind confirming that?
