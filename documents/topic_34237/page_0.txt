Does freeing memory (as per Motoko or Rust) decrease canister memory usage (and thus lead to decreased storage costs)?

Unfortunately not. Wasm memory can only be increased, not decreased (see [Wasm specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-2/#memory-instructionsâ‘ )).

Practically speaking, the only way to reduce memory usage is to reinstall the canister. This will completely remove the old heap memory during the reinstallation process.
