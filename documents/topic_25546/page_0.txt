I created canister and install the code
dfx canister create hello --network ic

dfx.json is empty 
`{
 "canisters": {
"hello": {}
}
}`

But I cannot delete it any ways. Need Help!!!

`dfx canister status  hello   --network ic`

Can you try to `dfx canister uninstall-code --network ic hello` and then delete? I wonder if it has something to do with the memory size, although that looks very normal

@skyhigh: your canister is on subnet https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/o3ow2-2ipam-6fcjo-3j5vt-fzbge-2g7my-5fz2m-p4o2t-dwlc4-gt2q7-5ae which has high storage usage. That's why operations that allocate more storage/memory require cycle reservation.

We are working with Hot or Not to reduce storage usage on that subnet: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/voting-for-a-new-ic-release-be69c35/25356/7

Also, [this](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3480) should help. It will be included in the next dfx release
