Hello there!

I wanted to deploy a test ICP container to the blockchain just now and wanted to top-up more cycles to the wallet that's being used as  the wallet that will burn it's cycles to deploy the container. 

As you can see in the screenshot, it has taken the initial amount of ICP  that I was thinking of converting into cycles and "burned" it or w/e and it failed converting it into cycles and it has also not reverted the transaction back and brought ICP back to the initial wallet, so I'm wondering what is the deal with this and if you could help me understand ?
