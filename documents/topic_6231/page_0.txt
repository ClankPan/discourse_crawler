Hi during playing with the playground I wasnâ€˜t able to debug some values. I use the hello world example with the following modification:

import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
actor Echo {
  // Say the given phase.
  public query func say(phrase : Text) : async Text {
    let a : Nat = 20;
    Debug.print(debug_show(a));
    return phrase;
  };
};

I canâ€˜t see the debug value i the log terminal. 

Any hints on that?
Cheers Roland

This is expected. `Debug.print` can only be seen when running locally. See this issue: https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground/issues/61

Thanks for clarification
