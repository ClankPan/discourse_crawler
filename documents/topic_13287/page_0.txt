I’m trying to allow users to upload videos and have the videos render in the browser. The issue I’m having is getting QuickTime videos to display when uploaded. I’ve reached a dead end on all other forums. I’m hoping there’s  somewhere here who knows. 

Any links to sample code would be greatly appreciated.
