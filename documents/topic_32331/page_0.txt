We would like to provide our users with NFT data by obtaining price changes for the corresponding NFTs through the NFT Marketplace.
However, we were unable to find the corresponding developer documentation or the canister id used.

Not much of documentation available but if you are good at reading code, can reverse engineer some stuff.

Entrepot has the source code open source, so you might be able to find some info there on how the data is retrieved https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/entrepot-app

Dab.ooo has an open source list of NFT canister IDs https://github.com/Psychedelic/dab/blob/main/registries/nft/list.json

All the best!

Thanks for the reply, dab.js is indeed a good js to use, I've been using it before.
The entrepot-app code repository I've checked and it's just front-end code in there.
I've also looked up the canister id inside the code repository, and to be honest, relying on that information for reverse engineering is very cumbersome.
