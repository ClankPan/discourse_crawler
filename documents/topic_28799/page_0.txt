Hey, I'm a high school student trying to make an IC project.

When I run "dfx deploy" it shows this error:

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/l.v/.config/kybra/rust/1.72.0/bin/ic-wasm'
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed to build all canisters.
    Failed while trying to build all canisters.
      The build step failed for canister 'bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai' (unfakeDir) with an embedded error: Failed to build custom canister unfakeDir.: Failed to run python -m kybra unfakeDir src/main.py src/main.did.: The custom tool failed.

I'm not sure on how to solve it and look forward for hearing on how to solve this issue

@lastmjs knows best, but I would guess that `cargo install ic-wasm` could fix this

Seems like we need to update the Rust version of Kybra, in fact Kybra needs a few really nice updates.

You can try this until we get a new release out. Someone asked about this in the Python Discord channel:

"You may be able to resolve this on your machine temporarily by going into your local virtual environment directory and changing this line to something like 1.76.0: https://github.com/demergent-labs/kybra/blob/main/kybra/__init__.py#L21"

We are looking into this, we will hopefully have a release out in the next few days

Kybra 0.5.3 has been released, let me know if this solves your issue
