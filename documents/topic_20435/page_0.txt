I am trying to host a canister under a custom domain following this documentation here https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/#well-knownic-domains.

I am using goDaddy, I tried to set the DNS records correctly as per the documentation. 
I then created the `.well-known` directory in the root directory, the one with the dfx.json file. Inside it I created the `ic-domains` as a plain file without any file type extension and put my custom domain name lilke `foo.bar.com` .
I aslo created the `.ic-assets.json` file in same root directory with the `.well-known` directory. and the dfx.json file and put the contents:
```
[
    {
        "match": ".well-known",
        "ignore": false
    }
]
```
and then deployed the canister on the ic.
That's pretty much all the setup I followed, but now when I start the registration process with the following commnand:
```
curl -sLv -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://icp0.io/registrations \
    --data @- <<EOF
{
    "name": "<custom_domain>"
}
EOF
```
I am gettin a bunch of data for the request and then finally this: 
```
< 
* Connection #0 to host icp0.io left intact
domain is missing from canister j62gc-2iaaa-aaaal-qbynq-cai list of known domain
```
This is where I am stuck, My guess is that maybe I put the .well-known directory and the 
.ic-assets.json at wrong places. Where am I going wrong? 
Thank you.

Looks like indeed your [https://j62gc-2iaaa-aaaal-qbynq-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains](https://j62gc-2iaaa-aaaal-qbynq-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains) file is not available.

Have recently answered a question about where to put the file, maybe you find something there?

Thank you, that worked and I got the ID back and then I run this command:
```
curl -sLv -X GET \
    https://icp0.io/registrations/ID
```
But the process have failed, I got this response back:
```
{"name":"todo.enochchirima.com","canister":"j62gc-2iaaa-aaaal-qbynq-cai","state":{"Failed":"failed to create acme order"}}
```
What could be wrong now?

-------------------------

iamenochchirima | 2023-06-04 10:43:41 UTC | #4

I run the command again, it returned Available, its working now.

@peterparker , The custom domain is working now, but it seems like the frontend canister have lost its connection with the backend canister, It's no longer querying items from backend if I access it using the custom domain name, but still working well if I use the canister id url, what other changes must I do so that the frontend and backend canisters keeps communicating with this new domain? I tried adding the new domain name to the CSP headers in the ic-assets.json file but it seems to have done nothing.
Thanks

@iamenochchirima 

Are you saying that:

- `https://todo.enochchirima.com` -> cannot connect to backend ❌
- `https://j62gc-2iaaa-aaaal-qbynq-cai.icp0.io` -> can connect to backend ✅

Do I get it right?

If yes, that's maybe an issue with the `HttpAgent`. Try to path `https://icp0.io` as `host` for mainnet.

e.g.

```
new HttpAgent({ identity, host: 'https://icp0.io' });
```

Yes that was the case, I implimented like that and it's working now. Thanks again

Awesome, happy to hear that 😃

Hi @peterparker, thank you for your advice, which guided me in adding the .well-known folder to the frontend public directory. The documentation wasn't particularly clear on this, but your input made a difference.

I've successfully received a registration confirmation message, and the status query indicates that everything is available. According to the documentation, it may take a few hours for the changes to propagate. However, it's been over 15 hours, and the custom domain still doesn't display anything.

Do you have any suggestions on troubleshooting this issue?

```
* Connection #0 to host icp0.io left intact
{"name":"audionaut.xyz","canister":"km6x3-2iaaa-aaaap-qb36q-cai","state":"Available"}%

Yes I've got an excellent suggestion, I gonna forward (right now) your message to my colleagues who know the domain the best :wink:.

Thanks @peterparker I'll dm you now a screenshot of the DNS config

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-12-06 20:13:53 UTC | #12

Hello @ferMartz 

There is one part missing in your configuration:
The CNAME from `audionaut.xyz` to `icp1.io`. If you cannot set a CNAME for your domain with your registrar, then you might want to consider the alternatives explained [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/dns-setup#apex-1). In short, some registrars don't allow CNAMEs for apex domains. Some offer an ANAME or ALIAS record instead. If nothing like that is possible, we recommend to switch to a DNS provider that allows CNAMEs for apex domains (e.g., Cloudflare).

-------------------------

ferMartz | 2023-12-06 20:28:13 UTC | #13

Hello @rbirkner . Thanks for your quick response!

I followed the same guide you [pointed out](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/dns-setup#apex-1). I'm using AWS and the CNAME record looks like the shot below. 
Do I need to change the CNAME?

rbirkner | 2023-12-06 20:54:21 UTC | #14

Unfortunately, Amazon Route 53 doesn't support CNAME for apex domains. You specified a CNAME for the subdomain @.audionaut.xyz and not audionaut.xyz. 

You can verify that by directly querying the DNS records for you domain and you will see that the response is empty:
```
$ dig AAAA audionaut.xyz +short
$ dig A audionaut.xyz +short
```
And compare that to:
```
$ dig AAAA icp1.io +short
$ dig A icp1.io +short
```

-------------------------

[quote="rbirkner, post:14, topic:20435"]
`dig AAAA audionaut.xyz +short`
[/quote]

@rbirkner got it. Thanks for the explanation!

I just moved the domain to cloudflare and added the records.
I will wait for replication. After that, do I need to notify the boundary node?

Never mind, I just checked and everything is working!!!

Thanks again...and to @peterparker

I have got "failed to create acme order" too, How did you solve it?

I passed all the steps but when I run the command for checking the status of my registration request I am getting the error: 
```
{"name":"icphubkenya.io","canister":"ucnis-pqaaa-aaaal-qjgla-cai","state":{"Failed":"failed to delete dns record"}
``` 

What does it mean and how can I solve it?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-06-27 07:50:52 UTC | #18

Hey @Stephen-Kimoi 

This sounds like a problem on our end. Let me look into it and I will get back to you!

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-06-27 07:55:55 UTC | #19

I checked and it was actually a temporary issue. The system failed to remove the TXT record that it had to put in place for the ACME-challenge. However, all the steps are retried after failures. Hence, it worked in a later attempt and now your custom domain is available:
```
{"name":"icphubkenya.io","canister":"ucnis-pqaaa-aaaal-qjgla-cai","state":"Available"}
```

Thank you very much DFINITY Team :smiley:

Hello @rbirkner 

I was trying to register another domain and I got the same error as before: 
``` 
{"name":"icphubkenya.com","canister":"ucnis-pqaaa-aaaal-qjgla-cai","state":{"Failed":"failed to delete dns record"}}
```

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-07-05 08:30:39 UTC | #23

Hey Stephen, 

it was a transient error and the registration was just successfully completed:
```
{"name":"icphubkenya.com","canister":"ucnis-pqaaa-aaaal-qjgla-cai","state":"Available"}
```

Note that there might be errors while processing your registration. However, they are automatically retried and usually, they are just transient.

Stephen-Kimoi | 2024-07-09 14:33:01 UTC | #24

Hello @rbirkner 

I am trying to configure another domain but I am encountering an issue. I have done everything correctly but when I run the command: 
```
curl -sLv -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://icp0.io/registrations \
    --data @- <<EOF
{
    "name": "friescoin.xyz"
}
EOF
```
I am getting the error: 
```
domain is missing from canister k74i3-jyaaa-aaaal-qjdza-cai list of known domains
``` 

I have configured the domain correctly in my ``ic-domains`` file. You can even check it here: https://k74i3-jyaaa-aaaal-qjdza-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains 

This is how the record looks like on namecheap: 
![image|690x155](upload://cqT4IxYBglNxgWYH22ywscB4vUm.png)

Where might the issue be coming from?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-07-09 15:15:48 UTC | #25

This looks all good to me. This error means that the boundary node cannot find the domain name in the file `/.well-known/ic-domains`. But as you say, the domain is there. I use this command to check:
```
$ curl https://k74i3-jyaaa-aaaal-qjdza-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains
friescoin.xyz
www.friescoin.xyz%
```
Can you just try submitting the registration again?

-------------------------

Stephen-Kimoi | 2024-07-11 06:35:56 UTC | #26

Yes, I've been doing that for the last two days without any success. What might be the main issue :thinking: ?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-07-11 07:48:12 UTC | #27

Ok, I will give it a try and see what the issue is.

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-07-11 08:04:09 UTC | #28

Hey @Stephen-Kimoi, I found the issue. Your `ic-domains` file contains a whitespace at the end of the line with `friescoin.xyz`. You can see it here when I request the file and then replace all whitespaces with an asterisk `*`:
```
$ curl -s https://$CANISTER_ID.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains | tr " " "*"
friescoin.xyz*
www.friescoin.xyz%
```
So you should just remove the whitespace and it should work. The custom domain service should be more forgiving and strip leading and trailing whitespaces. We already have a short list of improvements for the service and once we get to them, we will also tackle that.

-------------------------

Stephen-Kimoi | 2024-07-11 10:22:11 UTC | #29

Yes. Thank you so much!

Stephen-Kimoi | 2024-07-15 06:07:34 UTC | #30

Hello @rbirkner, I have a question. Why does my configured custom domain at ``https://investafarm.com/``work but the URL ``www.investafarm.com/`` doesn't work? 

This is how I've configured my DNS on namecheap: 
![image|690x196](upload://1I276pghkOucnqJwaZo6IkgvSTm.png)

And you can check my canister url for the ``ic-domains`` at: https://iytgo-raaaa-aaaal-qjifa-cai.icp0.io/.well-known/ic-domains 

Do you know how to solve such a problem?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2024-07-15 06:43:40 UTC | #31

Hey @Stephen-Kimoi, 
Have you also registered `www.investafarm.com`? You need to register every domain name, even subdomains separately. So you just need to setup similar DNS records for `www.investafarm.com`:
```
type            host                     value
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CNAME           www                      www.investafarm.com.icp1.io 
CNAME           _acme-challenge.www      _acme-challenge.www.investafarm.com.icp2.io
TXT             _canister-id.www         iytgo-raaaa-aaaal-qjifa-cai
```
Then, you can submit the registration in the same way you did before, but this time for:
```
curl -sLv -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    https://icp0.io/registrations \
    --data @- <<EOF
{
    "name": "www.investafarm.com"
}
EOF
```

-------------------------

Stephen-Kimoi | 2024-07-15 12:53:37 UTC | #32

Wow. It actually worked, thank you!
