Can actors open TCP sockets or call out to web APIs? If not supported now, would that be added in the future, or is it structurally impossible?

I asked about this once, some weeks ago (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/future-plans-for-motoko-base-library/1024/2), there wasn't any official response back then - maybe we'll get luckier now. :grin:

But I can't imagine that this isn't on the roadmap somewhere. Without the ability to do arbitrary networking, hardly any real-world application can be run on the IC. It'd be naive to expect the whole internet to migrate onto the IC at once. ;)

There is some algorithms for synchronizing external APIs and internal state. A good example would be Ethereum's Oracle concept (see EIP-1154). There are challenges for a general TCP connection that make it impossible, though.

We aren't yet discussing these possibilities, although that's a bullet on our roadmap. I can't say when we'll get to it, as nobody knows what the priorities will look like after launching mercury. We're all focused on that first.
