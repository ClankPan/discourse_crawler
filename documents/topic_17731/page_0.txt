is there a way to specify a canister ID for the `UI Canister`? currently that one get's deployed first locally so it has the ledgers mainnet canister ID which requires me to change the hardcoded canister id of the ledger canister for all dependent canisters which is pretty annoying :frowning:

I don't think there is a way to suppress creation of the UI canister. But if you do `dfx canister create --all` it should create those canister's IDs first, and only when deploying everything create the UI canister, which would allow you to snag that CID

i'm actually using `dfx canister create -all` but still the UI canister gets the ledger canister id if i run the command with the `--no-wallet` flag, removing the flag solves the issue :slight_smile:
