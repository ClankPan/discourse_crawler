Hi ðŸ‘‹

There is a [new proposal](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?proposal=101945) that, once released, will add plenty of new functionality.

On the NNS side:

* Support to enable and disable auto-stake maturity for hardware wallets with the latest IC Ledger app.
* Improved proposal rendering.
* Theme switcher also available in the login screen.

On the SNS side:

* Support to split SNS neurons.
* Support to increase the stake of SNS neurons.

Please let me know if you have questions or observations and as always, I am looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks!
