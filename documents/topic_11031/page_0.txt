I don't quite get the whole "modular blockchain" thing.

Also what makes Ethereum not monolithic? Because it has rollups? The IC will soon integrate with BTC and later this year with ETH. Does that make it still monolithic? In fact, the IC is really a collection of many subnet blockchains that are governed by a single "master" NNS blockchain. Does that make it modular?

If the issue is more about validity / fraud proofs (which I think are variations of "zero knowledge proofs"), then I admit I'm not an expert at all.

Can someone explain what's the argument for every blockchain needing zero knowledge proofs or risk becoming irrelevant? My understanding is that zk proofs provide additional security guarantees on top of BFT consensus. But they are more of a cherry on top rather than a necessity. In Ethereum's case, I suppose they are more necessary due to the lack of consensus sharing between the Ethereum blockchain and the various rollups, so they use zk proofs to "bridge" that gap. But why does a L1 like ICP need zero knowledge proofs, if we don't even use rollups? Chain key technology seems to work fine as is...

Yes. because execution still happens on layer 1(s).
You can find some more technical explanations (am not an expert) but the basic idea is optimizing layer 1 for data availability & settlement and doing execution on layer 2s.

Well you dont necessarily need zk proofs. fraud proofs (optimistic rollups) may work as well.
but zk rollups when reaching their full potential could give insane amounts of tps (in the hundreds of thousands).

The idea is you get almost the same insanely high security guarantees as layer 1 while also increasing scalability by an order of magnitude.


Theres a lot of nuances of course, but I still think this question is worth asking as many projects are starting to look into that direction (not just ethereum).

senior.joinu | 2022-02-22 18:51:39 UTC | #4

On the IC all the ZK-stuff could be implemented on top of the application level right now. Since no-one is working in that direction (publicly, I mean), it seems like there is just no real interest within the community to do that. Which for me personally is a signal, that speed and lower costs (scalability, basically) are the real reasons for people to like L2 on Eth.

Since there is no problem with speed or costs on the IC (it can already scale infinitely, there is just no better option) - there is no L2.
 
If somewhen in the future there will be any good reason to have ZKs on lower levels - I'm sure, this could be done by adding another subnet type. 

On the IC one could think of another type of L2 solutions, like ultra-cheap (but less resilient) storage or computational networks. Imagine that you have a network of nodes, against which you could run a MMO game server with thousands of users. Such a network could rely on ICs security guarantees, but provide real-time processing capabilities to its users.

I definitely agree speed is currently valued higher than security, and Im definitely not as alarmist about this as the tweeter is. Think it will take some time to play out.

However I'm not sure it would be accurate to call IC scaling "infinite" as it currently stands.
Since subnets don't share security it really doesnt differ all that much from cosmos IBC aside from everything being more tightly integrated.

Even query calls have to go through consensus as it stands.

Is it fair to call cosmos scaling infinite? I dont think so.

Yeah could be something, but tbh Im more interested in the IC becoming a layer 2 (yeah yeah I know, not gonna happen) because I do think similar systems to the IC will sooner or later start popping up in other ecosystems, in the form of layer 2s. 

Also the question then becomes, why even run it on IC if you get much higher security guarantees & other benefits with a layer 1 fully optimized for this (like celestia)?

Here is an interesting [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/zero-knowledge-internet-computer-virtual-machine/9129) that discusses how the IC could benefit from zk proofs.

My takeaway is that zk proofs enhance security and can enable novel single node trustless computations, but these use cases seem quite niche at the moment.

They play a more prominent role in the Ethereum ecosystem, because they seem to be used as a substitute for subnets + chain key in order to scale.

Of course, zk proofs are just one type of validity proofs. According to this [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-ethereum/6145/15?u=jzxchiang), the IC's native threshold signatures are another type.

In short, I feel like other blockchains are playing catch-up but who knows...

But you can grow individual subnets infinitely, so it is infinitely scalable. 

Also isn't Cosmos IBC just a mechanism to wrap and transfer tokens between blockchains? Can your code in one blockchain call methods from code in another blockchain? I don't think so.

Other blockchains are playing catch up in some areas, yes. UX & DX in particular are fantastic. But there's other exciting developments happening outside the IC that can't just be ignored.

Zk-proofs are not mandatory. Im purely speaking of layer 2s here (either zk proofs or fraud proofs may be used). 

Even if chain key + subnets were a substitute (lets ignore the lack of shared security) I would still say its only half true. BigMap? Cross subnet queries without the latency?

What blockchains exist that are trustlessly and highly securely connected to Bitcoin?

From what I understand IC does have global verification/security https://youtu.be/DP8X-NuG4z0?t=3668

Anyway it's pointless to compare traditional L1s to IC because they fundamentally different platforms. They both use blockchain technology and smart contracts but for fundamentally different purposes. Ethereum/Solana/Cardano/Avalanche/BSC are decentralized databases. ICP is a decentralized cloud computing platform. It's like comparing Oracle to AWS, apples and oranges. Ethereum ect... uses blockchain tech to utilize a network of nodes for for security first and compute capacity second. IC uses blockchain tech for compute capacity first and security second.

IC is not trying to be an absolutely secure immutable database. It's more on the execution layer side of things. I'm more concerned about IC's ability to compete with Rollups, who only have to focus on execution whereas IC has to worry about consensus/security as well. How capable will rollups be long term? Can their transaction speed/finality be faster than ICs 1-2 second update speed because rollups dont have to go through consensus and basically instantly finalize. Can rollups store data as cheap or more cheaply than IC? Will rollups have composabilty with eachother and interoperate as efficiently as IC subnets? Can ETH rollups run any VMs other than EVM? Will rollups be able to copy ICs distributed key generation and threshold signatures and box out IC of it's main innovation?

Yes, chain key is great. The communication being secure is certainly one aspect. However........
You are still fundamentally trusting two completely separate blockchains (which subnets are) with a different set of validators. They do not share security and chain key doesnt make a difference to that fact.

If rollups don't need consensus, then why bother with rollups at all? Why can't everyone run their own computation on their own computer, and publish their own zk proof using some well-regarded open source library?

I'm not familiar with rollups tbh... [this](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) has been on my reading list for a while.

I think they do need consensus, but since adding each roll up only increases gas use by a log function it pays for everyone to roll their transaction into one. The base proof is expensive it is only after chaining a few proof through that you get to a net positive. After that everything is gravy.

ZK proofs are the cherry on top as they mean a single node can run present valid blocks and that means the blockchain doesn't need to be slowed down by bft consensus, this can speed up latency but doesn't give you much on the throughout of the ic. Plus you are now slowed down by the speed at which you can generate zk proofs which may be slower in some cases than the bft consensus.  

ZK proofs introduce other necessities like the need for consensus on data availability, which celestia is used for. I don't think it's the only solution by a country mile... what Dfinity has going is a more pragmatic and simpler way to scale imo.

Was thinking about this question and I wonder if we could have an model where each subnet works a bit like an [arbitrum anytrust](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-anytrust-chains-cheaper-faster-l2-chains-with-minimal-trust-assumptions-31def59eb8d7) chain where if any node disagrees with a state change it posts data to another subnets and a random sample of all nodes across all subnets do the fraud proof. If there is fraud the NNS rolls back that subnet and punishes the involved nodes.

Node shuffling would basically enable shared security, or am I mistaken?

It‘s a nice threat, we need much more discussions around the topic of shared security. It‘s literally all that matters in the end.

Concerning scaling, personally, I find it fascinating that something like chain key tech casually comes out of the blue and is incredibly useful, while nobody outside of the IC ecosystem seems to understand it‘s implications. 

This makes me hopeful that the history books on scaling have not been written yet and that we might see unexpected solutions. 

For example, I generally like to draw comparisons between democratic systems and blockchains. Both delegate a task to a group of people (politicians/miners) while preventing them from acting maliciously by either seizing power or double spend. In democracies we can use our built in identity systems/sensors as well as efficient punishment mechanism (prison) to disincentivize malicious behavior. We can basically penalize malicious behavior beyond any kind of „stake“ politicians could theoretically be required to put up by putting them to prison.

Additionally, we can choose to pick politicians that are less likely to collude based on their identity, e.g. each coming from a different state for example. If we would not do that, we would potentially also need much more politicians to ensure that they are sufficiently unlikely to collude. The analogy here is that if we want to ensure that miners don‘t collude we can either have a lot of them, or fewer that are very unlikely to collude, which could potentially be achieved by them not being anonymous. The later allows us to simply increase hardware requirements to scale (throwing hardware at the problem).

So having an on-chain governance system might allow us to build secure systems that scale by throwing hardware at the problem without loosing security. That might be an unconventional way to scale that could just work. My thoughts are incomplete around how/if the IC is doing this exactly and if it really is robust but having known entities as nodes is definitely going in that direction.

I think these aspects are often completely forgotten when devs discuss scaling. A game theoretic problem plays into the whole thing, so computer science and cryptography are not necessarily the only tools we have to solve the problem.

Mathias | 2022-04-11 21:16:17 UTC | #32

Would you mind elaborating on why you would not consider it shared? 

My basic understanding is that game-theory wise we try to trap miners in a coordination game, where each does not have enough resources to bring us to another (worse) equilibrium (of the whole thing not working). With sharding, we try to detach that constellation from the replication factor of state. When doing so we can essentially have the same miners run more Blockchains simultaneously. To still trap them in that game-theoretical constellation we randomly switch them out as often as possible. To allow the sub-nets to communicate we either use a beacon chain, which is run by everyone and thus becomes the new bottleneck, or else we brilliantly come up with chain key tech to allow them to talk to each other directly, thus getting rid of the bottleneck (just to briefly celebrate that technology :)). 

Besides chain key tech, it's basically what Ethereum aims to do right?

If you refer to it only happening once a day or less than that, then I agree that more often is always better but would say that this is unexplored territory. Thanks for looking that up btw :). If you're thinking of something else, then please share, I'm eager to learn more.

Not sure how interoperable dapps built on them are. First of all them may be limited to using the same VM as the L1 they are connected to. And also I dont know how practical it will be for dapps deployed on different rollups to talk to eachother, maybe it's possible since they should all have access to the same L1 data/blocks.

Yeah interoperability is an active area of research, altho since different rollups share the layer 1 they actually dont need chain key to communicate to each other as I understood it.

I think you are mixing it up with optimistic rollups, but even there its not required to do all the computations. Only the part they disagree on https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#interactive-proving-1

In the case of cartesi its a RISC-V interpreter thats implemented on top of EVM on layer 1. Sounds crazy, but since it only has to run a single instruction it doesnt matter.

Optimism is similar but uses MIPS

Kurtis0108 | 2022-08-14 09:50:30 UTC | #41

The IC can go from monolithic to modular if they switched from the subnet model to every cannister being a blockchain with programmable security requirements. I dislike how the IC prescribes the speed/security tradeoff to developers, not letting themselves choose. 

Really the **only** function of the IC should be to co-ordinate and serve high spec nodes to developers looking to leverage blockchain consensus. As it currently stands the IC prescribes a compute environment to developers, and if their dapp does not function well within the 13~ node subnet environment they are essentially out of luck. There are lots of applications that require more than 13 nodes for security (defi) and likely lots more that require less than 13 nodes (non-critical data). I posted [a thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-about-icps-subnet-design/14464) about this but got no replies.

This model also opens up more opportunities for dapps. Consider the idea of an online videogame that could create a single cannister and assign a node count of 1 to serve as the server in an online match (real time videogames cannot process inputs through consensus) that then publishes the results to another cannister of size 10~ that stores historic game data. Something like this is completley infeasible with the IC's current model.

What makes you think that? Dfinity mentioned different subnet types in the past months, but never specified how far they want to push this concept.

Sure if modularity means separating consensus from execution, but the reason l1's are considering that is because they're designed for such low spec nodes that really can only do consensus. Layering is a technical nightmare and if I understand it right there needs to be 3 different networks, execution, consensus and data i/o. How do you manage the incentives for that? 3 different tokens? I think the ICs simpler solution of having spec requirements for nodes and smart contracts running in an asynchronous environment for horizontal scaling is simply the better design for 99% of projects.

Modularity is a generic term. Loosely speaking for subnets of 1000s of nodes a modular arch with separate data dissemination, consensus on md and parallel execution makes a lot of sense.

The modular architecture is a step in the right direction. For smaller subnets it’s modularity doesn’t mean much. 

Also it’s not 3 different network, single network with nodes having multiple roles probably being run as vms/services on the same physical node

I don't think eth is splitting it's network nodes into 3 different roles, optimism and arbitrum are ostensibly separate networks that provide execution for rollups posted on eth. That still requires another separate network for data i/o

ETH is the consensus + data layer in ETH2

-------------------------

Eth is not a good example of a modular blockchain arch. Modular blockchain arch is inside out of what Eth and eth2 would like to be.

Checkout Celestia, Aptos, Sui and the underlying paper on Narwhal and Tusk. Summary it’s separating out

1. P2P with data availability proofs (narwhal/tusk)
2. Parallel Consensus with block metadata (narwhal tusk)
3. Parallel async execution (block stm)
4. Parallel state certification 

Overall this results in natural batching and pipelining and thus high throughput - 160k TPS to 500K TPS. This is all for subnets having representative 4000+ nodes in a network. 

My 2 cent, subnets and modular blockchains are non-complimentary approaches to scale. Modular block chain thus isn’t particularly relevant in the IC context. IC story for scale is linear scaling with subnet additions. Modular blockchain won’t scale linearly they will plateau at points 

Modular blockchain is about extracting more and more throughput on a single state chain with 1000s of node using old school systems tech

Yeah although, you can have many layer 2s sharing the same layer 1. Not to even mention layer 3s (see starkware). Subnets dont share security so it doesnt feel like a great comparison. Does Cosmos have infinite scaling just because the chains are connected through IBC? I certainly dont think so.

What about when they enable [Interchain Security](https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035)?
