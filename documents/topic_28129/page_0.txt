Hi All, 

I am working on a project where we are doing a presale. As part of the pre-sale we are airdropping tokens prior to adding LP on the ICPSwap exchange. 

Our concern is, the users being airdropped might add LP before us. Hence, I am looking at like a transfer Enable function, that only allows transfers once its triggered. Can anyone help me with this?
