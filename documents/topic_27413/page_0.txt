Are Known Neurons able to list their neurons on IDGeek? This was a random shower thought but it intrigued me. The nature of selling a known neuron infringes upon the knowledge of the followers of that neuron. if a known neuron goes by a specific name and users of the Internet computer follow a known neuron based on the association/reputation of that name should that neuron to be sold on ID geek, then it would no longer be the same entity under that name. Can known neurons be delisted and thus required to do so before being placed on the neuron market? If not, I think this should be integrated as this can protect followers and the IC at large.
