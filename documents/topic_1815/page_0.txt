V0.6.18 of the SDK is now available!

Features and fixes include the following updates:
* A fix to `dfx upgrade` that prevents a main thread panic when `Option::unwrap()` is called on a `None` value.
* A fix to the name of the language service command to restore its compatibility with IDEs.

For Motoko:
* New syntax for option types: Option blocks `do ? <block>` and option checks `<exp> !`.
Inside an option block, an option check validates that its operand expression is not `null`. If it is, the entire option block is aborted and evaluates to `null`. This simplifies consecutive null handling by avoiding verbose switch expressions.
For example, the expression `do? { f(x!, y!) + z!.a }` evaluates to `null` if either `x`, `y` or `z` is `null`; otherwise, it takes the options' contents and ultimately returns `?r`, where `r` is the result of the addition.
* The argument to a `do` or `do ?` expression must be a block `{ ... }`, never a simple expression.
