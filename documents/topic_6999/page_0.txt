(Copied from megathread)

I propose that the [HTTP Gateway spec](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/asset-canister-source-code/6431/3?u=paulyoung) be made public/open source along with a process for proposing updates to the spec.

I am following up, that I still intend to help make this happen. our open source pipeline is at the last mile (meter?) with DFX so I have been pushing on making dfx reality first.

I guess this should include both the spec for the HTTP Gateway (`http_request`), but also the one for the certified HTTP assets (the `IC-Certificate` header). I am missing access to that right now for a little experiment/demo Iâ€™d like to do.
