Happy Monday, community!

We are super excited to announce the release of SDK `V0.5.7`! :tada:

# :gift: What's new?
The `0.5.7` release includes the following new features and capabilities:
* Motoko and the JavaScript library now support floating point numbers (Float).
* When using the Candid UI, you can view return values in text, UI, and JSON formats.
You can switch between the formats for representing values by clicking the results bar.
* Internal updates that are not yet user-visible to support future features. 

# :rotating_light: Breaking change
The `0.5.7` release includes the following changes that might require updates to existing programs:

* The name of the built-in Motoko library has changed from  `stdlib`  to  `base` .
* All of the module names in the  `base`  library start with an upper case letter.
* The  `principalId`  module has been changed to  `Principal` .

**Modifying existing programs**

If you have programs that rely on modules in the  `stdlib`  library, you must change the  `import`  statement to use the new  `base`  library name. For example, you might have previously imported the Array module using the following statement:

```
import Array "mo:stdlib/array";
```

With this release, you would change the statement like this:

```
import Array "mo:base/Array";
```


**Addressing case-sensitivity**

If your local development environment runs on macOS, you might be able to build your Motoko program using a lower case module name because the macOS file system is not case-sensitive by default.

If you use lower case module names, however, the same code will not compile on Linux computers. Therefore, the recommended best practice is to always capitalize module names. For example, use  `import Array "mo:base/Array"` , not  `import Array "mo:base/array"`.

# :hammer_and_wrench: Fixes
The `0.5.7` release includes internal fixes and improvements to the Candid user interface, the interface description library, and some refactoring of  `dfx`  commands.

Cheers! :nerd_face:
