Looking at Quill I see that there is an option to either Split a neuron or Spawn a neuron. Is there any documentation that explains the difference between these 2 actions?

This is quite in-depth but if you search this page for “spawn” you’ll find a lot of good detail. Essentially the spawn command allows you to release earned rewards. You convert earned maturity into ICP by spawning a new neuron and this new neuron can then be dissolved quickly to access the ICP (currently in 7 days):

The split command is unrelated, it’s used to divide a neuron, which is useful if you want to start dissolving a portion of a neuron while leaving the rest fully locked.
