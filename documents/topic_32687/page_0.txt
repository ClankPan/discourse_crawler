Feedback is welcome. Bitfinity gives the IC EVM compute capabilities and also enables sharding via interactions with ICRC tokens.  Execution layer currently live.

@skilesare , you once wondered what it took to build, of course this paper makes the journey look much cleaner. It doesn't mention all the difficulties that had to be overcome to get there. Section 4 onwards is the most relevant.

This is really clean and I learned a lot. I think it lays things out very simply. 

It seems you get a lot of simplification if you just use the ck alternatives(specifically I'm thinking for the ckERC20 stuff, but it looks like you've had to co-develop that. I'd be interested to see how the two implementations differ and what the design space in the remote contracts is.

I'd love to see more about account abstraction and canister wallets as I think that canister wallets on the IC have some really great applications that greatly simplify a bunch of the hoops that 4337 has to jump through. The linked youtube video gives me some interesting things to think about in the paymaster space.

And of course, I'd recommend losing all the references to Bitcoin, but that is mostly personal taste and you've likely done much more market research than I have.  There is so much here for ETH folks and they'll generally ignore it with the references to the orange meme coin. ;) And you may well lose the Maxis as soon as you mention EVM. You've built an ETH scaling powerhouse. You can lean in there... they're actively asking for it, paying for it, consuming it. 

Really great paper and I can see exactly what you're going for. It is clear and technical without getting too technical.

Thanks Austen, I can see what you mean. The first paper is intended to be more general, the one on bridging is more oriented towards Bitcoin given the trends. Glad you appreciate the work that's gone into the paper. I'll be honest, when Dfinity first launched, I thought a sharded EVM system was what they'd sort of try to deliver. 

Lots to be explored in the Account Abstraction space, hit me up if you want to  brainstorm.

Also, a practical issue for Dfinity's ckERC20 design is that they have a bridge for each ckERC20 token. In our design there's one bridge for all tokens on a particular network.

that's great!!! maxc. bitfinity will success.
