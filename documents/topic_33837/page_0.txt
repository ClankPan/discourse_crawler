Hello everyone! I'm excited to begin building on ICP and was deciding between Mokoto, Rust, or Typescript. I wanted to check in and see if there was any meaningful progress in Azle getting out of the beta version?

Azle will be moving to release candidate possibly in August or September, and hopefully 1.0 not too long after.

1.0 for Azle focuses on the core IC APIs and Candid RPC like exposing query and update methods, but not the Nodejs stdlib and Express and all of the traditional web/JS packages outside of the core language.

Azle's beta is very mature and the move to 1.0 is mostly our (Demergent Labs') signal to developers that we believe it is production-ready as in safe. The functionality can be used now and is being used now. You can make your own decision on if it is safe, we have hundreds of automated tests and in practice people find very little wrong with Azle outside of the installation/build process, which we just improved greatly in the last release.

So 1.0 is mostly about safety/security, you can use it now if you feel comfortable.
