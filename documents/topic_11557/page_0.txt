I'm trying to set a principal as a controller for a canister. When I perform this command `dfx wallet --network ic  add-controller my-principal` I get this response in the terminal `Added my-principal as a controller`. but when I try to view the canister from the nns.ic0.app UI, I'm getting told that I can't access the details of the canister because I'm not the controller. I made sure to run this command beforehand `dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet bs4fi-aaaaa-aaaap-qaabq-cai` and got this result in the terminal `Creating a wallet canister on the ic network.
The wallet canister on the "ic" network for user "default" is "bs4fi-aaaaa-aaaap-qaabq-cai"`

Does anyone know why I wouldn't be able to view the canister details from the UI at this point?

Note that there is a distinction between `wallet controller` and `canister controller`.

This thread should clear things up

Thank you. That thread was exactly what I needed.
