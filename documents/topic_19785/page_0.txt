## Motion Proposal

The Internet Computer is an adaptive blockchain, which supports sophisticated protocol economics through intelligent decentralized governance. We propose a new feature that will enable a neuron holder to perform an "emergency unlock" to release locked ICP, according to special mechanisms and parameters set by the NNS that prevent a flood of ICP being accidentally released.

## MOTIVATION

The Internet Computer's NNS represents the most sophisticated on-chain governance system ever developed. Its liquid democracy structure is exceptionally suited to the rapidly evolving crypto environment. However, this design may result in a divergence of vision and priorities between some stakers and the NNS over time. Additionally, the network's security parameters require that these stakes remain illiquid for an extended period, often up to 8 years. Therefore, we propose to implement an emergency unlock mechanism for neurons in order to harmonize these interests and to increase the security of the network over the long term.

## SPECIFICATION

**1. Emergency Unlock Maximum**
In any given period (for example a week), a maximum volume of locked ICP can be released from neurons by emergency dissolve actions. This is called the "Emergency Unlock Maximum." This value is set by the NNS, and can be updated by proposals at any time, for example according to market conditions.

**2. Emergency Unlock Bids**
Unlocking neurons comes at costs to the neuron holders, requiring them to burn a portion of the stake. During any given period, the volume of ICP that neuron holders wish to emergency unlock might exceed the Emergency Unlock Maximum. Therefore, neuron holders wishing to emergency unlock their ICP, must bid to make use of the available capacity, by submitting "Emergency Unlock Bids." Bids are submitted for specific neurons. This involves specifying how much of the ICP that will be emergency unlocked will be burned.


```
Bid {
UnlockAmount // how much you wish to unlock
BurnOffer // what percentage the system can burn
NeuronId
}
```

In order to submit an unlock bid, one needs to be the controller of the neuron.

**3. Bid Scoring**
An "bid score" is calculated by dividing the "burn percentage" by the dissolve delay multiplier which is the boost in voting power (and thus voting rewards) that the neuron receives due to its dissolve delay. The overall idea is that neurons with longer dissolve delays should be subject to a higher burn percentage. Recall that the dissolve delay multiplier is a linear function of the dissolve delay: dissolve delay multiplier = 1 + (dissolve delay in years) / 8. Hence the dissolve delay multiplier has values between 1.0625 (for 0.5 years dissolve delay) and 2 (for 8 years dissolve delay). For the determination of the bid score the neuron "age" is ignored.

**4. Stack Ranking Bids**
The bids are stack ranked in order of decreasing bid score. Starting from the highest bid score, the available capacity defined by the current Emergency Unlock Maximum, is assigned to the bidders, until no more capacity is available (the last successful bidder might only have part of their bid satisfied).

**5. Minimum burn penalty**
Given this is meant to be an emergency measure, there should be a minimum burn penalty of 25%.

**6. Handling of staked maturity**
Staked maturity can be unlocked in the same way as staked ICP and is subject to usual maturity modulation in addition to the burn penalty.

## Perceived benefits

Neuron holders are able to unlock in extraordinary circumstances. The ICP ecosystem benefits from the unlock due to the burning of ICP tokens (deflationary measure). On the other hand there might be short-term negative impact on the ICP price. This should be controlled by the Emergency Unlock Maximum.

## EXAMPLE

INPUT：

> Emergency Unlock Maximum: 40k ICP

**Person 1：**
> Bid:
>* UnlockAmount: 80k
> * BurnOffer: 50%
> 
> Referenced neuron:
> * Staked: 100k
> * Dissolve delay: 3 years
> 
=> Dissolve delay multiplier: 1.375 (=1 + 3/8) 
=> Bid score: 36% (= 50% / 1.375)

**Person 2**

> Bid:
> * UnlockAmount: 40k
> * BurnOffer : 25%
>
> Referenced neuron:
> * Stake: 60k
> * Dissolve delay: 1.5 years

=> Dissolve delay multiplier: 1.1875 (= 1 + 1.5/8)

=> Bid score: 21% (= 25% / 1.1875)

**Person 3**

> Bid:
> * UnlockAmount: 100k
> * BurnOffer : 75%
> 
> Referenced neuron:
> * Stake: 100k
> * Dissolve delay: 5 years

=> Dissolve delay multiplier: 1.625 (= 1 + 5/8)

=> Bid score: 46% (= 75% / 1.625)

**Result**

* The bid from person 3 has highest priority and is processed with the full amount. The full neuron with a stake of 100k ICP is unlocked of which 75k is burned and 25k is released. 15k (=40-25) ICP is left for unlocking further neurons.
* The bid from person 1 has the second highest priority and is partially unlocked. 30k ICP (out of a requested unlock amount of 80k) is unlocked of which 15k is burned and 15k is released. 70k ICP (= 100k - 30k) remains locked in the neuron. No ICP is left for unlocking further neurons.
* The bid from person 2 cannot be processed.

**为 NNS 添加紧急解锁神经元方法**

## 提案概要：

互联网计算机是一种能够自我调整的区块链，它通过智能的去中心化治理来实现复杂协议经济。ICPLeague 尝试提出了一个新功能，让神经元持有者在紧急情况下可以解锁他们的 ICP。这个功能有一些特殊的机制和参数，以防止大量 ICP 被意外释放出来。

互联网计算机的 NNS 代表了有史以来最先进的链上治理系统。其流动民主结构非常适应快速发展的加密货币环境。然而，这种设计可能会导致一些持有人和 NNS 在时间推移下的愿景和优先事项发生分歧。此外，网络的安全参数要求这些权益在很长一段时间内保持非流动性，通常长达8年。

因此，我们建议实施紧急解锁神经元机制，以协调这些利益并增加网络在长期内的安全性。

## 具体规定

**1. 紧急解锁最大限额**

在某个特定时期（比如一周），神经元最多能释放多少锁定的 ICP，这个数额叫“紧急解锁最大限额”。NNS 设定了这个值，可以根据市场情况随时进行调整。

**2. 紧急解锁竞标**

解锁神经元需要持有者付出一些代价，也就是要燃烧掉一部分 ICP。在某个特定时期，神经元持有者想要紧急解锁的 ICP 可能超过了紧急解锁最大限额。所以，想要紧急解锁 ICP 的持有者需要通过提交“紧急解锁竞标”来争夺可用的额度。竞标是针对特定神经元的，需要说明要解锁多少 ICP，以及其中有多少将被燃烧掉。

竞标格式如下：


> {
> 
>         解锁金额 //想要解锁的数额
> 
>         燃烧报价 //系统可以燃烧的百分比
> 
>         神经元 ID
> 
> }


要提交解锁竞标，你需要是神经元的控制者。

**3. 竞标评分**

“竞标得分”是将“燃烧百分比”除以“溶解延迟乘数”来计算的，这个“溶解延迟乘数”表示神经元因溶解延迟而获得的投票权（以及投票奖励）的提升。

总体思路是，等待解锁时间久的神经元，应承受更高的燃烧百分比。请记住，“溶解延迟乘数”是溶解延迟的线性函数：溶解延迟倍增器 = 1 + （溶解延迟（以年为单位）/ 8）。

因此，“溶解延迟乘数”的值在 1.0625（0.5 年溶解延迟）和 2（8 年溶解延迟）之间。

在确定竞标得分时，忽略神经元的“年龄”。

**4. 排名竞标**

竞标按照竞标得分递减的顺序进行排名。从最高的竞标得分开始，将当前紧急解锁最大值定义的可用容量分配给竞标者，直到没有更多的容量可用（最后一个成功的竞标者可能只能满足他们竞标的一部分）。

**5. 最低燃烧惩罚**
考虑到这是一种紧急措施，应有 25% 的最低燃烧惩罚。

**6. 处理锁定的成熟度**
锁定的成熟度可以与锁定的 ICP 以相同的方式解锁，并受到通常的成熟度调节以及燃烧惩罚。 感知的好处 在特殊情况下，神经元持有者可以解锁。由于 ICP 代币的燃烧（通缩措施），ICP 生态系统从解锁中受益。另一方面，可能会对 ICP 价格产生短期负面影响。这应该由紧急解锁最大值来控制。

## 好处

神经元持有人能够在特殊情况下快速解锁，但需要燃烧 ICP。由于 ICP 代币的燃烧，ICP 产生通缩，ICP 生态系统从解锁中获益（通货紧缩措施）。为了避免紧急解锁对 ICP 价格产生短期的负面影响，应该由对每日的紧急解锁上限来控制。

这也能让与网络长期利益不一致的搭车者及时退出，从而为系统引入更多的利益一致者 。

### 举例说明

**输入**

> 紧急解锁上限： 40k ICP

**用户1**

> 出价：
> 
> * 解锁金额： 80k
> * 烧毁燃烧： 50%
> 
> 参照神经元：
> * 质押：100k
> * 溶解延迟： 3年

=> 解散延迟乘数： 1.375 (=1 + 3/8)

=> 竞价得分: 36% (=50% / 1.375)

**用户2**

> 出价：
> 
> * 解锁金额： 40k
> * 烧毁燃烧 : 25%
> 
> 参照神经元：
> 
> * 质押：60k
> * 解除延迟： 1.5年

=> 解散延迟乘数： 1.1875 (= 1 + 1.5/8)

=> 竞价得分：21% (=25% / 1.1875)

**用户3**

> 出价：
> 
> * 解锁金额： 100k
> * 烧毁燃烧 : 75%
> 
> 参照神经元：
> * 质押：100k
> * 解除延迟： 5年

=> 解散延迟倍数： 1.625 (= 1 + 5/8)

=> 竞价得分：46% (= 75% / 1.625)

**结果**

第3个人的出价具有最高的优先权，并被全额处理。拥有100k ICP的全额神经元被解锁，其中75k被烧掉，25k被释放。 剩下15000（=40-25）ICP用于解锁更多的神经元。
第1人的出价具有第二高的优先权，并被部分解锁。30k ICP（要求的解锁量为80k）被解锁，其中15k被烧掉，15k被释放。70k ICP (= 100k - 30k) 仍然锁定在神经元中。没有ICP用于解锁更多的神经元。
第2人的投标不能被处理。

Could you please develop a bit more the calculus ? Were does this 40 or 25 comes from ?

If the 8-year law can be changed at will, then the ICP token symbol can also be changed to ICP2 at will

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 12:50:31 UTC | #9

To make an analogy, if you have an 8-year fixed deposit in the bank and you want to cancel the interest and withdraw the principal, what do you think these people want to do?

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 12:51:42 UTC | #10


I am against any move to make commitments, here are II account sales

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 12:59:58 UTC | #12

This is a really good idea. Some people will say oh it’ll be bad for ICP price. Nah not really because we’re countering with a person urn and decreasing ICP supply making your holdings more valuable over time. If there’s a dip people will buy. Someone else might say well don’t lock ICP up with money you might need. I’m sorry to say it but even the most responsible person isn’t immune to real life happening sometimes. Sometimes things happen that you had no control over and there’s that. In my opinion this makes me more bullish on ICP and would love to see the community get excited over big sporadic burns. We’d even have a burn twitter or something on the ICP dashboard showing big burns so people can shout them out lets s way to celebrate. All in all this is the best proposal I’ve seen so far and should be implemented asap.

-------------------------

thirdparty1 | 2023-05-05 13:00:17 UTC | #13

I agree with this opinion. People who are left with ICP think that even if they did an 8 year neuron lock, they should have the ability to give some penalties and unlock it immediately.
Try voting for all members to see if there are many people investing eight years with unchanging beliefs or if they should be forced to have eight unwanted years.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 13:02:37 UTC | #14

Also I know there’s a new marketplace to sell anchors but I don’t like that because then you’re obligated to sell your log in for all dapps.

-------------------------

thirdparty1 | 2023-05-05 13:04:25 UTC | #15

If so, should evil laws never be fixed and remain evil for the rest of your life? Then it doesn't fit the purpose of decentralization either. That's why there's a majority vote.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 13:09:00 UTC | #16

There’s no reason to vote this down unless you have no feelings lol this makes so much sense I made an account to comment my opinions

That’s the point of a government. We vote. Things evolve.

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 13:14:19 UTC | #18

So when will this be on the NNS

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-05-05 13:20:13 UTC | #19

I'm all for this, would this also impact the rewards? Would the remaining neurons receive a higher share of the rewards?

Even ETH doesn't force locking up your ETH for so long. A decent penalty for long term stakers seems apt.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 13:20:16 UTC | #20

Don't be tempted by petty profits, there are risks involved, and you don't realize that this is not a suggestion for the good development of ICP, on the contrary it will hurt it

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 13:25:38 UTC | #21

People would be taking Ls not profits by doing this. Imagine someone had locked money and someone in real life died and they had to pay their mortgage.

-------------------------

thirdparty1 | 2023-05-05 13:38:03 UTC | #24

I'm sure most Fudders are long-term ICP holders with long-term investments, not other communities. Because of Neuron, who is stuck in a long time of eight years, he's paying high interest to the bank every month. This is much higher than the reward from Neuron.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 13:39:26 UTC | #25

You are a kind person! But the law is not! We follow the blockchain law so we can gather. If someone speculates or changes the law through loopholes, this will cause someone to leave. I believe you are all for the better ICP, but the law is the law and cannot be changed!

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 13:41:24 UTC | #27

No I’m all for this! This needs to happen!

😂  sacrifices must be made

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 14:01:51 UTC | #31

Don't even think about it, destroying the law is equivalent to destroying faith, if I have the opportunity, I will also destroy the ii account buying and selling behavior! If you pledge for 8 years, you will be with ICP for 8 years. If you want to escape, I'm sorry, it's impossible!

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2023-05-05 14:16:49 UTC | #34

@blockpunk thanks for taking the time. Think the proposal is well written and thought.

But right now, you have already a live alternative that achieves the exact same outcome, that is Id Geek:
https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.ic0.app/

Holders can and should sell their II at a loss according to their "urgency". 

No need to intervene and change the locked amounts and rules.

Can you clarify if Id Geek marketplace solves or not your needs?

Hope this helps :pray:

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2023-05-05 14:25:58 UTC | #35

That’s not true. You have to give up your whole anchor. You might have two years of social app build up on that’s. SNS tokens locked up. If someone needs their ICP only they should have that. Also what if your ledger is attached

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2023-05-05 14:47:08 UTC | #37

Why not just use idgeek?

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 15:39:53 UTC | #38

Those who use tricks to try to cancel their commitments and try to escape with the least cost, anyone who is bullish on ICP will not agree

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-05 17:41:41 UTC | #40

I started out on the NNS locking in 300 ICP coins to be part of this project and had no real idea about what I was involved with when staking.

12 months later I believe or as I understand it now.

I am supposed to vote on issues and have found like this morning the only votes on proposals are mostly upgrades and most of the time, as I follow, they have gone through nearly as quickly as they appear.

I have received around 70 rewards.

The ICP coins value has dropped by ⅔’s

I do not see that I am of any value whatsoever as a staker and now I have the opportunity to staking in other projects spending more hours of my day not contributing to anything other than my stake and time.

Now you want to penalise me by taking my rewards by getting out quickly, already taking a loss on my investment and of no worth to the project.

I now realise that ICP is nothing more than a payment for cycles and I will never be able to buy a coffee, except, I will now start dissolving and buy a milkshake in 8 years.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2023-05-05 18:57:27 UTC | #42

I am 100% agreed.
Dont forget that liquidity is vital

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-05-05 19:06:59 UTC | #43

Honestly we need to prevent neuron marketplaces. 

This isn’t a bad idea provided safeguards exist to prevent too many neurons from being unlocked at the same time. 

This proposal achieves all of that. I think it makes sense.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-05-05 20:08:32 UTC | #46

The IC utilizes a reverse-gas model, so non-code minded and the general non-crypto person can interact with the IC without being involved or knowing they are participants in crypto. 

The locked (staked) ICP rewards owners of ICP and incentivizes them additional votes in our governance system and pays them rewards for doing so. While benefiting other holders by having their ICP locked and making it scarce.  You and the scottsummers person sound like you are trying to destroy ICP? Maybe I’m confused but could you explain.

-------------------------

Hala | 2023-05-05 20:36:55 UTC | #47

You realize there are neurons with millions of ICP locked? No matter what % cut they get on their ICP if they use the emergency unlock feature and decide to sell since they will be in huge gains. they will tank the price and would be in profits by miles. Im against this

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-05 21:00:23 UTC | #48

Yup, by then the IC should be flying, DFINITY and Don would have moved on and I should have enough for that milkshake.

My observation of the IC as it is today.

Currently I see that this project is and has overcome many of the problems of other coins.

While the IC has built connections to other coin systems for Speed, Transaction Cost and Security, what do I feel the IC has been given in return, Nothing, we are ignored for showing and fixing their weaknesses and in return they try to improve those same faults, poorly and do not show any interest or recognise the efforts of the IC.

Those who want to execute an emergency, get out of your staking and are willing to give away your rewards, sound a bit extreme and I think you should consider your choice.

While at this time the IC is making connections to other coins and inviting new projects onto the IC as this is very important but as I have seen of late, there seems to be a new push for projects to get onto and connect to the IC on their terms and conditions bypassing the NNS.

Some with quite arrogant attitudes.

I want to stay staked in the IC as I believe that at some point we will come to understand that most other projects out there have no interest in furthering the IC and have their own interest and reasons for joining the IC.

Let's just consider the main purpose of the internet, transferring of data and information and the payment of these services. While many other projects want to build for their own reasons they seem to lack or just create the same old system of problems and practices with the emphasis of having a following.

The IC has rebuilt the internet with speed, low transaction costs and the best security. As it is an infrastructure and not a following or a service and or a data provider as such and already has a payment system built in then why are we not creating or extending this so we as ICP holders are able to purchase items as a replacement for all the old payment systems connected to fiat monies.

We are seeing many banks fail with trust in the old system at an all time low while other coins projects are still connecting to these old systems. We have the ability to create a new payment system of trust far from the old system and the public would buy ICP’s for transactions.

I would suggest that we not talk about the emergency to get out of the IC as stakers but on how we could further the IC and talk about and vote to make choices about the future direction of the IC so one day we could have our own purchase card and buy a coffee.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-05-07 20:18:04 UTC | #52

The root of this proposal has a few things that I do really like and I think it hints at some mechanisms that may offer some flexibility to enduring the full neuron lock all the time while still maintaining the fundamental network assumption.

1. I would imagine that there is some period maximum that is low enough that someone could show that it was virtually impossible to profit from a hidden information attack.  It at least increases the risk of their attack in that they have a much harder time calculating their return to justify the attack and if the information leaks earlier then their return plummet's exponentially as the entire network races to exit.

2. My biggest concerns with neuron transfers has been the reduction in forward-looking tendencies of the entire network because they are no longer required to take an 8 year view on the network.  This certainly causes a use to discount their ability to exit as long as the minimum trends very low and can trend even lower.
 
I do question whether this really helps those that are having an "emergency" because in a "real" emergency they would need to bid as low as possible. Say the mechanism was tied to 10% burn windows with a max of 90%. Wouldn't anyone in a real emergency always bid 90% and hope for a lack of a full period to grant them a lower burn?  Anyone not biding 90% is likely engaging in speculative and not emergency behavior.

The "world" typically provides this emergency through social safety nets at the family, village, municipal, or state level. Volumes have been written about which level is the most efficient and which is best for long term economic and societal help. I wonder if a better facility doesn't align along those lines more. It is tough to pull that off while staying anon.

It would be great to find a way to collaborative way to help in these situations without anyone having to lose or burn neurons.. but that requires an alternative kind of capital(typically social) to account in.

As far as what a "safe" minimum would be, it would likely be really low.

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-07 20:51:17 UTC | #53

How about we add a proposal that the NNS be capped to a number of stakeholders but mutable and make being a stakeholder something of value of responsibility that rewards are payment for services that are taxed and then available for income for personal use.

That stakeholders number of tokens are also capped for obvious reasons except for DFINITY and certain followed groups that are mutable but essential to the NNS.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-05-07 22:32:42 UTC | #54

I think EOS had something like this where only the top 100 validators could approve blocks.  I know it had some issues.

Limiting participants does create "something at stake" especially if you can revoke a voting license or have something like ragequit, but it is hard to align it with robust decentralization and raegequit doesn't work so well unless the proposals are financial in nature.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2023-05-08 04:00:50 UTC | #55

I think that a minimum burning ratio must be set, otherwise there may be a situation where unlocking occurs without burning if there are no bidders.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-08 09:48:05 UTC | #56

Did anyone of you try IDgeek before coming to support this ? What would be the main issue you had just using that simple option ? Curious not judging the 8 year gang/army whatever some of you call it.

-------------------------

kyliux | 2023-05-08 10:07:40 UTC | #57

The only issue with IDgeek is that people willing to keep some of their neuron or SNS and would be willing to sell just a part of other neurons cant since IDgeek is here to trade the whole account.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-08 10:17:00 UTC | #58

That seems fair. I was thinking maybe larger amounts of ICP would be hard to sell since there is not much traction there yet, majority are easy to remember anchor numbers without any real value other than  that.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2023-05-08 13:05:23 UTC | #59

I believe that early unlocking should require burning all the interest at least, just like depositing fixed-term in a bank. If you want to withdraw early, you have to lose all the interest. This is the minimum burn. If there are bidders with higher burn ratios, they will be processed according to the highest burn ratio.

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-08 16:41:20 UTC | #60

As I understand the rewards system as it stands today.

Within 8 years the Estimated rewards will be zero, DFINITY will have dissolved their neuron ICP tokens to a level if not all that they will no longer be the dominant staker.

Where today we have centralised systems where a CEO runs and controls the organisation and in return receives Billions in fiat currencies, the IC will be decentralise by millions who run the IC and will receive Nothing as their ICP cannot buy them a cup of coffee and only be used to pay for cycles to run your website if you have one.

We need to allow those who want an emergency release from their staking and set the level of stakers where the rewards systems will continue to pay high rewards and limit the number of ICP per staker so there is no dominant centralised figure within that community.

While you can argue this could be taken over by bad actors I would suggest that some would say the same about the current situation.

No staker should be allowed to sell their stake to a third party and if they wish to be released from their stake then their ICP is returned to the address they came from and their account closed.

I see no incentive to be staked into the future where I will spend hours per day for no return.

From decentralization point of view, this is actually good for decentralization, but it seems that it is a little difficult to implement since you need to consider a lot.

After reviewing the proposal in detail, I think I change my mind, I will support it.

If you invested in crypto, it is money that you are willing to lose...

Apart from that, that bet allowed him to develop and improve the blockchain.

Betting 8 years gives back to ICP to have a long-term horizon.

The burn, although it is good, does not have an impact to improve the deflation of the currency.

Ex: %25 burned out of 1000 -> 250 ICP
Current Reward % -> 0.48

To equip the burnout:
it takes more than 500 days (1.5 years) (17.8 %)  (actual)
1.851 days ( 5 years) (%10)

I think the idea is good but the minimum % needs to be at least 50% of the neuron and nobody is going to do it, they prefer to sell it.

[quote="MillionMiles, post:59, topic:19785"]
I believe that early unlocking should require burning all the interest at least
[/quote]

Actually, losing the interest that has accrued is a small penalty for a staker who has just locked a neuron but a large penalty for a staker who has kept their neuron for say 7 years of an 8 year lock-up period.  If getting a long term neuron is meant to reflect commitment to the long term health of the network, the fast quitter has shown less commitment than the staker who lasted 7 of 8 years and so the fast quitter should have to pay a higher penalty.

If fast quitting is cheap, that allows someone to make a long term neuron, vote against the interest of the chain with correspondingly inflated power, and then quit, paying little.

I think it would be better to make the burn percentage a function of the remaining dissolve delay.  I know there are game theorists out there, I'm sure they will be able to come up with a good function if the community accepts this in principle.

I completely agree with your points regarding the penalties for stakers who fast quit and those who hold their neurons for a longer period. Fast quitting can have negative effects on the network's health and stability, and it is important to ensure that stakers are adequately incentivized to commit to the long-term success of the network.

I agree that game theorists can play an important role in designing a suitable function that can achieve the desired outcomes, and I hope that the community will be receptive to this proposal. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this important topic.

Instead of a flat out burn of the token what would you think if we burned the tokens by buying cycles with the fee. Those cycles could be held by the nns and used to sponsor developers to start up their project and get a working product to market for cheaper.

First of all, thank you very much @blockpunk for the detailed and well thought-out proposal. We appreciate your engagement and clear description of the issue and suggested solution. We can follow the overall motivation that, in very special circumstances, it might be desirable to have an emergency unlock accompanied by an appropriate penalty fee.

Regarding the suggested bidding mechanism, using a market-based approach seems like a clever way to automatically determine the unlock penalty based on supply and demand.

However, we have concerns about the complexity of implementing an interactive bidding scheme. It would require significant effort on the NNS backend and frontend, which could pose security challenges and result in a lengthy implementation timeline.

As an alternative, we propose a simplification for improved security and ease of understanding. We suggest enhancing the "minimum burn penalty" design component by introducing a dissolve delay-dependent unlock penalty function that can be configured by the NNS. Neurons would be able to initiate an emergency unlock with a specified penalty based on this function. The specific shape of the penalty function can be defined separately, but it should have a strong punitive effect (e.g., an 8-year neuron could be subject to a burn penalty of 66%).

The "Emergency Unlock Maximum" design component would still be necessary to prevent flooding the ICP market.

In the future, the mechanism could be expanded to include market-based features if needed. We welcome your feedback and input from the community regarding this proposed simplification.

Hi all, if anyone has additional thoughts or input, I would greatly appreciate feedback on the proposed simplification mentioned above (using a dissolve delay-dependent unlock penalty function). Please feel free to share your ideas or suggestions.

I don't think you can throw open the gates without significantly tainting the way people vote.  Even a 2/3 haircut may make give people an out that alters how they vote for the good of the network. There has to be some element that makes it so that they can't be guaranteed an exit.  Maybe a max exit per week and a lottery for that 'space' each week.  A lottery would be more straightforward than a market mechanism.

I'm pretty sure I have the most extreme position on this, but I am pretty sure that a series of marginalized choices lead to a marginalized outcome and I didn't lock for eight years to end up halfway to the best possible network we could build.

One of the side effects I liked the most about long term staking without possibility of exit is that it leads to long term thinking and long term behavior. 

It is so different from anything else and a main reason I am personally so committed to making the IC a success. 

Anything that undermines this long term thinking, which I believe this proposal does, is not something I support.

Hi @bjoernek, I think it is impossible to make any accurate predictions on what would happen if this is implemented. Personally, I am neutral and do not have a strong opinion one way or the other.

Since the idea is being entertained, some people are going to be happy, and some people are going to be mad. The easiest thing to do is let the people in the ecosystem decide with a vote.

In my opinion, if people decide to exit the ecosystem by backing out of their commitment, the penalty should be significant, and it should also benefit the people who stay. Using the dissolve delay-dependent unlock penalty function sounds reasonable.

I think there is no need for this, the emergency that started this has passed and so did peoples interest in it. Lost faith in a long term project after only 2 years because of the current price of ICP is not an "emergency" in my opinion.
