Hello everyone. First time posting here and looking forward to learning more.

I was wondering if it's possible for wallets in the IC to have a status toggle feature that prevents unwanted airdrop transactions from processing? Like an offline state that halts the airdrop's canister calls to your wallet.

Considering how easy and cheap it can be to self-mint NFTs, I worry that spam airdrops will be the next wave of malicious attacks to harass individuals online.
