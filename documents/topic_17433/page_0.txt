Hello everyone! 

We are excited to announce a new collaboration which brings runnable [Motoko code snippets](https://embed.smartcontracts.org/) directly into the [Medium](https://medium.com/) social publishing platform. 

As a part of an ongoing effort to overhaul Motoko's documentation, we wanted to make it easy for anyone in the IC community to create interactive tutorials and code examples across the Internet. 

Here is a quick demonstration of how it works:

This feature was made possible by the [Embed Motoko](https://embed.smartcontracts.org/) code snippet service, which you can use to share interactive Motoko programs on almost any blogging site. 

Embed Motoko is an open-source project, so feel free to [report a bug](https://github.com/dfinity/embed-motoko/issues) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/dfinity/embed-motoko/pulls) on GitHub:

https://github.com/dfinity/embed-motoko

Let us know if you end up using these embeds in a Medium story ([or anywhere else](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NydVLV0k7sDPhKs8Owa8sKEtZ8F0Us4K?usp=sharing))! This tool is under active development, and we are eager to tailor this project to any creative use cases you might discover.

**Update:** it's now possible to embed these code snippets directly into this forum!
