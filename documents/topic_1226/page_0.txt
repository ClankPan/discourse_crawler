Hello community!

`V0.6.6` of the SDK is now available for download :tada:

The `0.6.6` release features several new commands for managing canisters. The release includes the following new commands for managing canister operations and the canister lifecycle:

* The  `dfx canister status`  command enables you to check whether all canisters or a specific canister in a project are currently running.
* The  `dfx canister stop`  command enables you to stop all canisters or a specific canister in a project to prevent canisters from receiving new requests.
* The  `dfx canister start`  command enables you to restart all canisters or a specific canister in a project so they can resume receiving new requests.
* The  `dfx canister delete`  command enables you to delete all canisters or a specific canister in a project.

As a reminder, you can find the complete release notes for the last few releases on our [docs site](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/sdk-release-notes.html) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/docs/releases).

Happy coding! :nerd_face:
