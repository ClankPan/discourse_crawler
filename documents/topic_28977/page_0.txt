Hi

Is there a possibility to recover my tokens when I loss my seed phrase connected to my NNS app? I still can access NNS but my ICP is in hardware wallet controlled. when i try to move the funds it gives me this error: 

"Sorry, there was an error trying to execute the transaction. Wallet account identifier doesn't match. Are you sure you connected the right hardware wallet? Expected identifier: 8a7fc846a320a2d5f66aafd6949beebf45e4589916fc3c3f355a794e6b094732. Wallet identifier: 1c7315e9e1e9f155c2a35cab8b44dd78396b51253099b25e6d6ae4cdddb0e9c0"

can i still recover my funds here? i got 3000 icps.

Hi @jyconcp 

Can you still sign in on https://identity.ic0.app? If yes and you did not protect the recovery phrase in the past, then you have the option to create a new recovery phrase (to replace the old one).

With regards to the ICPs held using a ledger device: This sounds like an issue with your HW wallet. Do you have multiple HW wallets?

Sadly, I understand that the seedphrase mentioned – as lost – is the one of the @jyconcp’s Hardwallet, not the one of their Internet Identity to which the HW is attached.
