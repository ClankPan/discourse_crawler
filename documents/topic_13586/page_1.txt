Hi @bjoernek,

Thank you for your detailed analysis.  You bring up a great point that I hadn't included in my initial back-of-the-envelope calculations... much of the new voting power from existing neurons with less than 6 months will not vote and thus will not affect the APY.  9.3M of the existing, less than 6 months neurons are neurons 40xx, which DFINITY has already stated will not be voting.  In addition, we could assume that the neurons that are locked and less than 6 months will not vote, since my belief is that their owners have never accessed them.

In summary, I think you are correct that the APY would probably drop only a minor amount from this change, perhaps around 25 basis points.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-08 11:39:11 UTC | #103

I think this argument is hanging by a thread...we rely predominately on Dfinity for the development and your argument is that our selecting a neuron (once or twice a year) to follow satisfies not depending on a third party.

Also, every other PoS has this setup and they haven't been declared a security due to decentralisation.

Let me ask the question...so what if it is a security?  It means fillings to the SEC...by who?  Why is staking on Binance with no effort not triggering it as a security?  True decentralisation will alleviate all this and is the only reason why Bitcoin and Ethereum are not considered a security.

I think this whole Security thing is the boogeyman...

-------------------------

FloridaSnow | 2022-06-08 14:14:28 UTC | #104

These are good points. They are reason enough not to do it, IMHO. I’d benefit from this change, but creating additional risk during uncertain times seems like a misstep.

[/quote]
Because the part that matters is the function of the token on the network, Binance "staking" is the exchange offering money for sustained liquidity. It's a loan, not an investment contract.

[/quote]
Something can be a security for a long time before the SEC gets around to evaluating it, they are pretty busy, the important part is that we don't expose ourselves to that risk once ICP grows to a size that would put it on the SEC's radar. Speaking of which, the SEC just opened an investigation on BNB 2 days ago.

You don't have to take my word for it since it apparently is meaningless to you, listen to an Attorney talk about the difference between ETH and ETH 2.0 and how that change severely impacts its potential status as a security: https://youtu.be/xCXbftjfEjI?t=276 . Or you can take a look at the CRC and get an idea of what characteristics hinder a token on the Howey Test: https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/framework. If you do, you are free to DM me if you want to discuss further, if not, I think we should be done here, this is no longer productive for this thread.

radudaniel | 2022-06-08 17:40:51 UTC | #107

1. I like the idea of short term staking as it is relevant to give people a reason to keep the coins in the NNS and also participate in voting. We can not expect everyone to have the same time & risk preference. 

2. As for rewards, the dissolve delay bonus could start a bit higher in order for the APY for up to 6 mths to be in the 3%-8% range - if we really want people to stake the minimum should be 3% otherwise it will simply not attract stacker.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-06-08 17:44:08 UTC | #108

Wow…on vacation and I have not had a chance to read anything but the first post, but I don’t see how this doesn’t open up the NNS to all kinds of time based attacks. At first blush I’d classify my support as vehemently opposed. I’ll try to digest later, but this seem fundamentally break “skin in the game staking”….this may be doomed with a neuron market anyway, but this just seems be an open invitation to subvert the NNS without having to face the consequences.

-------------------------

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-06-08 18:12:25 UTC | #109

Low APY is because we didn't want to create much impact to the existing stakers. The more we increase the bigger the impact. So we proposed keeping it small.

-------------------------

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-06-08 18:17:20 UTC | #110

This is not about mapping out return on investment but rather can this mechanism be leveraged to increase governance participation.

-------------------------

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-06-08 19:43:26 UTC | #111

According to @Dylan  
> From my perspective, The biggest advantage of the proposal is for neuron holders who plan to dissolve their neurons. That is, most everyone except for who have locked for 8-year. Currently, you have this 6-month window at the end of your staking period where you get 0 rewards. For someone who wants to stake for just a year or so, they're getting no rewards for half of their staking period, so why would they sign up for that?
> This proposal allows everyone to get rewards through that 6-month period. Sure, the rewards taper off rather rapidly, down to zero at the end, but there is a psychological factor at play here that you are still getting rewards for those 6 months. With the way it currently works, it feels like you are penalized for dissolving. If this proposal were implemented, it doesn't seem like a penalty any more.

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-06-08 18:35:31 UTC | #112

Thankyou so much @diegop. These are very helpful.

-------------------------

Rsl_033 | 2022-06-08 18:55:50 UTC | #113

I believe the initial design of tokenomics and lockup for governance are still valid.

Nikhil's point about the barrier to entry to governance caused by the 6 month minimum dissolve delay is valid. I would suggest "official" videos covering the process, as diegop [alluded to](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586/21?u=rsl_033)... "staking your ICP on the NNS" "compounding your ICP" "withdrawing your ICP from a neuron" are all topics which DFINITY's Youtube channel could cover (but so far hasn't) with short step by step videos to encourage engagement. If that's not enough, making a paper trading version of the NNS frontend which allows you to drag a timelapse slider showing amongst other things how voting affects rewards would cover all the test tx concerns - the real concern when I do a test tx is it shows up the other end - if I didn't have confidence that the NNS will unlock and disburse in 8 years and the token price is at least my average buy-in by then, no amount of 7-day stakes would convince me to commit. It's the long term price action that is covalent to staking, IMO

The issue of of the 6 month window... it is clear that 6 months of any staking term is devoid of rewards and any calculating investor would amortise the benefits over term. The proposal decreases the incentive of multi-year staking. 

[In reaction to](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586/59) ld-dfn1's explanation, I'd iterate on the above. If your strategy doesn't support a 6-month timeframe for engaging in ICP governance then don't expose yourself to the downside risk of locking (all) your tokens. I appreciate [Lomesh's point on dipping their toe](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586/71?u=rsl_033), but I don't believe that's the actual sticking point when compared to an exchanges' 7 or 30 day offering. If the community's concern is exchange manipulation of the token price possible through liquidity on the back of those APYs... then it's not about governance after all, and you should come at the problem directly.

I agree with you. It seems that this proposal is nothing to do with governance, it has to do with counteracting the exchange manipulation of token price. So we should attack that problem directly.

Maybe I am misreading your comments or the one you quoted or maybe even @nikhil.ranjan and @Lomesh-dfn1 ‘s replies, but my assessment is more dumb simple: 

*This proposal is exactly what it says about: it is about getting more people to participate in governance by giving them chance to experiment.* 

There is no hidden motive about exchanges or anything clever. It’s as simple product thinking as:

“people tell me they won’t go try X before committing 100X, what if they have a way? Let’s ask community to see what they think.”

I don’t mean to put you in the spot, but I used your quote to address directly something I saw hints of: folks trying to decipher the “real intent” vs the plain, boring stated one. **Could the goal/intent be unimportant, bad, poorly executed? Sure! But I want to make sure we don’t ignore the simple version of the stated goal.**

Is that fair? If I misread or misconstrued your words, please don’t hesitate to correct me.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-06-08 19:39:36 UTC | #120

Those were my words, and that's just my personal opinion (I'm not involved in the creation of this proposal) as to what the biggest advantage of the proposal would be, that there might be people who don't want to stake ICP under the current system because of the 6-month period of no rewards, so the proposed changes could encourage more medium-term staking.

While neuron holders who have no plans to ever dissolve their neurons don't benefit directly from the proposed changes, increased ICP short-term and medium-term staking and the corresponding reduction in the liquid ICP supply could have a positive impact on ICP price, which would benefit all neuron holders.

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-06-08 19:39:38 UTC | #121

Thanks for your feedback. I would clarify that fighting exchange manipulation is not the intent here. If that was the case the proposal would have suggested APY numbers comparable to those offered by exchange. 

The intent is to lower the barrier to entry so that community members on the sidelines can see NNS in action. This cohort isn't necessarily trying to optimize for highest APY but still need some flexibility on their lockup duration.

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-06-08 19:46:32 UTC | #122

Thanks for your feedback @skilesare. The voting power for shorter staking duration is significantly lower than ones with higher dissolve delay. For instance, staking for 7 days is 1/26th of the voting power for 6 months. The voting power decays much faster for dissolve delay less than 6 months in an attempt to prevent such attacks.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-06-08 19:58:19 UTC | #123

I believe that you believe that this proposal is about getting more people to participate in governance. I believe that getting more people to participate in governance is a good thing. I reached the conclusion that I did without explaining why. My apologies. What follows is my deep down thoughts.

However this proposal will not increase governance. What exactly is governance? To me it is about actively participating in the act of managing the Internet Computer. Following a neuron to get some rewards is NOT the essence of governance, IMO. 

So  what does that involve? 

* Participating in communities, forums, reddits. 
* Following folks on twitter. 
* Internalizing one's knowledge about Internet computer.
* Spend  some icp on worthwhile things on the internet computer (i.e. get a dmail vanity address, provide liquidity to dex)
* Build something on the internet computer. 

This requires a substantial long-term commitment  and focus. This proposal advocates a very short term participation  (1 week, 1 month etc). I have difficulty in seeing how this will significantly aid participating in governance. 

I realize that we might be coming at it  from different angles. The second angle to look at is governance purely from a staking and voting perspective.  Most people (including yours truly) follow other neurons. Do we really think that we can get people up to speed on voting/rewards in 7 days? I think not. Most people will just follow other neurons. Given that and especially from a short term perspective, people would not be interested in real governance. Then the second angle boils down into getting the rewards and there others have the eloquent case for why short-term investment is not appropriate for ICP at this time. 

Hope this helps in explaining my thoughts. It is good to use direct quotes because it leads to frank and honest discussions.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-06-08 20:09:55 UTC | #124

@nikhil.ranjan  @diegop My personal opinion is that all $ICP holders have the right to vote. But also take into account whether a whale wants to manipulate votes for a certain proposal.  they can borrow a big loan and just deposit within 7 days to vote, then dissolve their neron???  so in my opinion the voteable neurons will lock for at least 30 days instead of 6 months like now.  because only those who really support and really care about IC stake and vote.  but if it's just for short term rewards they won't send their ICP to NNS to vote.  because on Cex exchanges, it is possible to deposit ICP with an interest rate of 10% APY for 30 days.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-06-08 20:13:57 UTC | #125

This is perfect! Now you are explaining the rationale as you see it.  

However, inherent in that aim is the ability of reducing the liquid supply which may have some short term positive impact of ICP price. So if that is the one of the goals, then it should be explicit. 

As a 8 year neuron holder, I am most interested in is increasing utilization of ICP; over the long term.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-06-08 20:39:08 UTC | #127

I am also very interested in the issue of inflation of ICP, whether DFINITY or the community will come up with some proposals for this, the number of ICP generated is many times higher than the number burned, causing ICP to lose  value over time.  Measures should be taken for this as soon as possible! need prosposals for increases the demand for holding and using ICP in the IC ecosystem and burning more ICPs to balance the generation and burning.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-06-08 20:36:01 UTC | #128

The voting rewards system is designed to incentivize staking of 90% of the total supply (currently 55.6% is staked). I believe that the closer we get to that 90% goal, possibly helped by proposals such as this one, the more the liquid supply of ICP is reduced, leading to a positive long-term impact on the price of ICP. That's just my opinion, not a goal of the proposal as far as I know.

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-06-08 20:37:14 UTC | #129

Thank you for the clarification. You make very fair set of points and I completely agree with you that true governance participation is not just following someone else for collecting rewards but would require all of the key points that you mention above like participating in forums, following people on Twitter, experiment with dapps on IC, etc.

Just my opinion here: I am thinking of this as a funnel. In my mind it's okay if we can get another 100K people that just start to follow other neurons as the Step 1. My personal thesis is that once we can get more people to see NNS in action a reasonable subset of them will start going down the rabbit hole and start becoming more active participants (where they will do exactly what you describe). It has to start somewhere and the intent here is to make it easier for people to enter the funnel. If we can help them cross the first threshold they will be more vested in the future. 

Again I am just sharing our thesis but certainly open to feedback from the community. If we all feel this shouldn't be the path forward then we will drop this and move on to better things :)

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-06-08 23:10:06 UTC | #130

Ok….after reading I think I’d like to make a couple points.

When we pay governance participants to vote in our NNS, we are not just paying them to participate. We are paying them to participate with capital *at risk*.  The system breaks down if that risk is eliminated. There are things we are going to vote for that are going to take months to implement and if the voters are not still engaged then they have not provided “proof of stake”.(I’m looking at you https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623)

*In theory*, **in an ideal world** no one who voted yes on that should be allowed to remove stake from a neuron until we’ll after the market has had the opportunity to integrate the evidence based results of that proposal into it’s valuation. My bet is that we won’t even see it roll out until after 6 months has passed since it’s execution, meaning that our system has some significant flaws already. Lowering this seems mind boggling short sighted. Even if it is “small amount of voting power”, economic conditions could make that a “large amount of voting power” A year ago $130 ICP was not an absurd proposal and $6 ICP was highly unlikely to folks making this calculation. I’m hoping 0.23 cent ICP isn’t in the horizon, but 26x changes is price is not absurd volatility for us to consider in this space.

If anything, I’d argue that we need to increase the minimum to at least 1 year with 48623 as the poster child as to why. We are also supposed to have the ability to change our votes, but don’t yet.  We don’t know what votes are coming where a 1% margin could make or break and if a rival platform can nudge things one way consistently enough then you end up in a bad place.  And yes people do this and are this crafty. Looks at the current judicial branch of the IS government that has been methodically targeted by an out of power and fading political agenda in such a way that highly unpopular agendas are being legislated from the bench by Unelected judges.

Now, solutions. Lower it to 7 days for xdr votes. The time horizon on those is just a few hours and short term dissolves would be “at risk” for well past when their vote was relevant and when the network would be able to self correct. If someone votes to muck up the xdr ratio the cycle system will go crazy and effect token price pretty quickly. Now those are weighted, but I’m also in favor of removing weights. In the mean time people Would get to mess around with voting and get some kind of reward.(there may be other categories that have short timelines like node rewards)

As an aside, Origyn currently uses 1 year as a minimum(but this is under debate). The consideration is that industry is even slower at adopting change and thus we needed more time to implement votes and have their effects integrated into the market.

One solution to fix this problem of at-stake would be an ice-age like forcing mechanism that would require an “implement by” date that would further lock any accept votes until t+6 months. If the proposal is not implements by t, the proposal becomes void and tokens are unlocked. This is probably too complicated to actually implement, but it would put much more conviction behind votes.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2022-06-09 03:12:28 UTC | #132

This kind of attack will only makes the whales bankrupt. If they borrow a big loan just to vote and dissolve, community just make another counter voting proposal to cancel. And then let us see, how long the whale could survive from the interest if they want to keep on attacking. Meanwhile, it also cause icp circulating supply squeeze makes future attack more expensive.

-------------------------

Cryptoking777 | 2022-06-09 13:34:56 UTC | #133

Agree. The 6 months is a safety mechanism to avoid whale activity on ICP governance. As you state, there are other options for staking and higher yield. There are more to come such as farming in InfinitySwap. Ppl need to understand that the yield ir rewards are grwat but the NNS staking is about governance first and rewards last. 

They need to understand the vulnerabilities to the network with the reduction in staking time. It is not in the best interest of the network. 

My vote on this will be no.

Hi, this thread got huge and I'm currently not able to go through all of it - so apology if such idea is already anywhere above.

1. main goal is
[quote="nikhil.ranjan, post:1, topic:13586"]
encourage additional users participating in the governance process of the Internet Computer
[/quote]

2. main problem are changes in current staking rewards

So why not to make this **simple and separate from current tokenomics**:
- create a **fixed and repeatable 7 days staking option** for neurons
  - **reward would be NOT in a form of `ICP maturity` but rather as a `NFT maturity`**
    - **params to be discussed**
    - NFT could be created by dfinity or **rather by community NFT creators who could cooperate with dfinity on this** (no offense dfinity, I'm just not sure how much `artistic` do the scientists and engineers feel...)?

I believe that this would **introduce enough interesting option for people who would like to `try`**, and still **causing NO changes to current tokenomics and rewards** (depends on the params discussion).

What is the low security in nns internet identity?

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-06-10 17:11:32 UTC | #138

I think by that is meant that if one of your II devices is compromised, attacker can delete all others and change your seed phrase - unless you delete the compromised one first.
It's being discussed for a long time and hopefully will get fixed soon.
But frankly, it's surprising how long it takes, if this happened in banking/financial sector nobody would be allowed to go home until it's fixed, nobody...

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-10 17:37:03 UTC | #139

All it takes is using a compromised long enough an attacker can generate an anchor to your Internet Identity, if that happens it is game over no matter how safe you stored your seed phrase or if you're using an hardware wallet.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-10 17:38:56 UTC | #140

I agree, Internet Idenity has been poorly designed, it's not intuitive to use, it requires specific HW/SW and is somehow less safe than metamask with a ledger attached.

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-06-12 13:36:12 UTC | #141

I can't agree with that, I'm fine with II (in sf there is always something to fix or do better, anywhere, anytime) I'm just not so happy with approach to this security threat. This will need to improve, that's something what all investors do check and require extra care.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-06-10 18:53:21 UTC | #142

Off topic for this thread, but why do you say a compromised Internet Identity is "game over" when using a hardware wallet? If using a hardware wallet, performing ICP operations requires the hardware wallet.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-10 18:55:47 UTC | #143

True but I'd still lose access to my ICPs cause the attacker can remove the wallet and revoke access to my II

-------------------------

@nikhil.ranjan @diegop 

Thank you for starting this discussion on how a decrease in the minimum dissolve delay to receive voting rewards can attract new participants to NNS governance.  I agree with that hypothesis, but needed time to study the proposal and model the changes before I wanted to comment.  During that review, I concluded that there may be a better way to make the change that I'd appreciate if you will consider.  I have documented it in the medium article linked below because it is too much information for a forum post.  The article contains a link to a Google Sheets document that I shared that enables you to test the full model, check it for accuracy, and challenge assumptions.

https://medium.com/@wpbartlett/alternate-recommendation-to-increase-nns-governance-participation-by-enabling-short-term-staking-e29e746d9cb2

I can definitely support tokenomics changes that lower the minimum dissolve delay to receive voting rewards. However, I want to do it in a way that also makes it more attractive to stake long term and mitigates an increased security risk from enabling voting participation from stakers that are not committed for the long term. I believe the modeling data presented in this article shows that a more holistic approach to these tokenomics changes can be achieve by **two simple changes to our current tokenomics: decrease the minimum dissolve delay to receive voting rewards from 6 months to 1 month AND increase the maximum dissolve delay bonus to from 2x to 3.5x. These parameters seem to make it more attractive for very short term staking and for very long term staking.**

I look forward to learning what you think about this alternate suggestion.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-06-13 04:09:40 UTC | #153

Wenzel, how would you feel about the reduction in APY / VP that arose from providing a steep curve to short term stakers between 0-6 months to NOT come pro rata across the curve but rather just reduce the starting point of 6 month stakers? 

I believe that would solve your issue of unfairly penalizing long term stakers for the benefit of short term stakers. It would add in a steep curve between 0 and 6 months and marginally steepen the curve between 6 months and 8 years

Thanks for this proposal @wpb, especially appreciate your sheets with all the numbers. 

I would prefer to keep proposals as small as can be. Could you not have two separate proposals, one for reducing the min voting dissolve delay, and one for changing the max dissolve delay bonus? I think keeping the dissolve delay bonus linear while lowering the min voting dissolve delay is appealing, but I don't think we should increase the max dissolve delay bonus and incentive 8y neurons even more than we already do today. 

The part wrt 51% attacks in your blog post i believe is not exactly right. If you want to do a 51% attack on governance, you would use 8 year neurons, because if you can fully take over control, you could unlock your tokens anyway via a proposal. By boosting the max dissolve delay bonus, you increase the power for 8y neurons, and therefore make it cheaper to do a 51% attack on governance (but i still don't see it as a realistic threat).

Changing tokenomics (reward vs dissolve delay curve) destroys the assumptions we used to choose a particular dissolve delay. So If we change it, maybe we should also allow changing the dissolve delays of our neurons?

-------------------------

I wouldn’t want to implement this change as two separate proposals.  In order to add staking options at the low end of the dissolve delay spectrum, I think we need to incentivize the high end of the dissolve delay spectrum.  While they could be separate proposals, I wouldn’t want one getting implemented and not the other because that would not meet the objective of the OP.  I believe it is a very simple change to constants in a few lines of code and requires no new code, so it seems it could be a quick and easy proposal to implement.

I agree with your point about the 51% attack vector.  I only felt the need to say something about it because it is sometimes used as an argument against lowering the min dissolve delay.  I just wanted to preemptively put data behind a response that lower DD is not a security risk with either of these proposals.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-06-13 11:35:49 UTC | #159

I’m not opposed to someone using the models to test different hypothesis and come up with additional suggestions.  The AltProp that I documented in the article is what I came up with as the best solution to meet the objectives of the OP during my analysis, but there could be other good solutions.  This forum topic is a proposal by @nikhil.ranjan, so any actionable ideas that are suggested need to convince him to change specific details of his proposal.

I think a shorter term staking option is a reasonable idea to incentivize more people to participate in IC governance, but the returns need to be attractive enough for people to participate.  I’m not sure 1.7% for 1 month accomplishes that goal, but 6.4% has a better chance of success.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-06-13 13:47:18 UTC | #160

I thought the entire idea behind the NR proposal was expressly not to provide meaningful rewards to short term stakers (less than 6 months). 

Rather, the intent was to provide a “taster” of governance such that they learn how it works and stake for longer. It’s buy before you try. One risk with your proposal is that we may have a bunch of folks who actually stake for 1 month. 

You’ve mentioned that low rewards won’t be very good (1.7% for a month) but that’s actually the point. It’s not an unintended consequence. It’s just a way for folks to tinker with governance.

kvic | 2022-06-13 19:45:44 UTC | #161

I invested into the NNS stake protocol because I read a about this article: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/

May 1, 2022 - Staked, so I am a newbie and lots to understand. 

While I believe other parts of ICP seem to be moving forward and making contributions to further this project I have been very disappointed with Governance.

Governance has given followers a bad name that they should be penalised for not actually voting but the only proposal being put up are system team updates that only need to be followed anyway.

Other than Governance calling me a name and wanting to take away my rewards for themself I also see a pattern for lowering other standards that were put in place and it’s more about how to further reward themselves while claiming to make more newbies find staking their investment in the NNS more attractive.

Reality is that no one is investing in anything at the moment, check out the stock market, war, disease and the main thing is the colossal debt racked up by most governments around the world. 

This is the perfect time to be staked in this project.

I propose that the followers of the NNS invest further funds to their stake for the future of this project, as I will, wait out this period of fear and the desperation that comes from it, vote NO.

Hi @wpb 
Many thanks for your detailed analysis again! This spreadsheet is very useful for bringing the discussion forward. I would like to highlight one subtle but important point, which appeared [higher up in this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586/97) in a discussion between @Kyle_Langham and me:

* For the impact on voting power and APY we need also to consider whether the neurons with dissolve delay < 6 months will actually vote or not. 
* I made the assumptions that approx only 50% of these neurons will vote, which leads to a minimal impact of 0.25% on overall APY. 
* If I include this assumption (i.e. half the voting power of the 0-6 month bucket) in your spreadsheet it seems to suggest that the impact on APY of the 8 year gang between the current set-up and original proposal is less than ~~0.1~~0.4%.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-06-17 17:14:51 UTC | #164

I would need more information to understand how you arrived at those numbers.  However, the model in it's current form may not lend itself to performing this analysis.  It's built with the same assumption as the dashboard APY reporting, which is an assumption that all neurons will always vote.  I think this is a reasonable assumption for this type of analysis since the design intent of the NNS is that all neurons always vote and voting rewards are allocated proportional to that participation.  

There isn't enough information in the API to easily build a model that accounts for voting participation rates on Governance topics.  It requires information like how many governance and routine business (e.g. subnet update) proposals are submitted each day and what percentage of each dissolve delay bucket are voting on Governance proposals.  I do plan to work on this more complicated model to see if it is possible using information from other API sources, but I don't think it is necessary for the purpose of this discussion.  

For every neuron that does not vote on Governance proposals, their voting rewards go to neurons that do vote on Governance proposals.  Hence, if we were modeling the 8 year gang based on actual APY today, the range would be something like 12-30% APY as opposed to 20-23% APY as shown in the Current model.  The same goes at the low end of the dissolve delay range.  For every neuron less than 6 months that does not vote on Governance proposals, there will be neurons in that same region who get an increase in voting rewards relative to the average because they do vote on Governance proposals.  Of course, it's not that simple because you really need to model the entire data set to understand how lack of voting on Governance in one bucket affects APY in all the other buckets.

So to make a long story short, I don't think lack of voting on Governance proposals results in a change in the average APY.  My hypothesis is that it just spreads out the range of APY for each bucket.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-06-22 09:58:35 UTC | #165

To bring my overall point across, I see the value in your proposal:
Instead of introducing a kink in the dissolve delay function you suggest to keep the linear shape and slightly rebalance it in order to not negatively impact the long stakers. This has the additional advantage of simplifying the implementation. 
@lomesh and @nikhil.ranjan: What is your view?

In terms of estimating the impact on the long-stakers, I am making the point that we can refine the estimate on how much additional (active) voting power we will add, because the majority of rewards is paid out to active voters (and thus the additional inactive voting power which does not vote on governance topics will not matter so much).

As derived in the calculation above, I estimate that we will add 7mn additional voting power assuming 50% actively voting neurons  (which is still a conservative estimate as these neurons probably vote less actively than the global average of around 50%). If I enter this estimate in your sheet in the tab NRProp (cell I65) I derive a much lower impact of less than 40bps on the APY of the long stakers. Can you follow this line of argument (and did I interpret your spreadsheet correctly) ?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-06-22 04:04:19 UTC | #166

It is definitely true that when there are fewer votes cast the voting reward goes up for everyone who votes.  The daily reward pie gets split between fewer votes.  It actually doesn't matter if you take away those votes from the new <6moDD bucket, the 8YG bucket, the dissolving bucket, or the non dissolving bucket.  The result is the same.

According to the IC-API, there are currently 28mn ICP in nuerons that are dissolving that are less than 6 month dissolve delay (cell H15).  They would all vote on all Exchange Rate and all vote on other routine business proposals (e.g. Subnet Updates) since they are following Dfinity by default as configured at genesis.  The APY for all of those non Governance proposals would be equal to the results displayed in the models because the models assume all neurons always vote, which is true even for this new <6moDD bucket.  It is only for Governance proposals that 53% of total voting power in the NNS is not voting.  If you were to subtract this 53% of total voting power from any combination of cells I65, I54, and I25, then you would end up with APY that match all neurons that vote for those Governance proposals.  If you then apply proposals weights to the APY for all Governance proposals and the APY for all non Governance proposals for any given day (based on the number of proposals of each type that are submitted), then you end up with the daily rewards that are reported to us each day in the form of maturity.

So to make a long story short again, yes you can subtract away votes from any bucket and increase the rewards for everyone else that does vote.  However, I don't think that represents an apples to apples comparison of what would happen to the baseline case (aka worst case scenario) from our current participation rates if we were to add this new <6moDD bucket to the reward distribution.

All that said, it would be just as valid to think about how many new votes will be added that don't exist today if NRProp (or AltProp) were successful at attracting new governance participants to the NNS.  We can pick any definition of success and add 10mn, 20mn, 40mn, 80mn votes to to the model and see how much the APY prediction goes down for all buckets.  If any of these scenarios are accurate, then NRProp in the current form will end up putting more and more voting power in the hands of people who own neurons that don't have the long term best interest of the IC in mind, which runs counter to the objective of the tokenomics incentives.  Hence, this change needs to also increase the max dissolve delay to counter this effect.

This just brings me back to the point that, in my opinion, we shouldn't lower the dissolve delay that pays voting rewards without also increasing the max dissolve delay bonus enough to 1) ensure that the voting power increase for the longer stakers at least matches the increased voting power of the shortest stakers after recognizing some definition of success and 2) give the longer term stakers a tokenomics incentive to vote yes for this proposal.  I also happen to think this proposal has a higher probability of success if the new <6moDD bucket has reasonable rewards, which is why I'm hesitant about the steep dissolve delay bonus slope for the new bucket.  However, if we do move forward with a steep slope for the new bucket, then I would recommend a max dissolve delay bonus of 3x (which is 1.125x at 6 months instead of 1.0625x) to help offset the new rewards (this is also consistent with the preference that @dfisher expressed above).  I would support this proposal under those conditions, but I would still be hesitant about the probability of success of attracting new NNS participants due to the very low APY for a 1 month dissolve delay.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-06-22 05:52:22 UTC | #167

I see panic as the reason for adjusting the minimum dissolve delay because of the whole crypto market being volatile and down at this time, I believe the reason is so some can sell up and move on and it is their reason to support lowering.

As far as participating is concerned the only proposals that I see on the NNS to vote on are the hard working teams like, The DFINITY Foundation, ICP Maximalist, Internet Computer Association, cycledao.xyz and ICDevs.org and others which you can follow to get the rewards.

Other than that I did not see any stakers participating in a proposal for anything other than changing followers to lose rewards for following, so now they have to update their following every 6 months or lose their rewards or support dog boys spamming on the NNS.

I was told that followers should not be rewarded because they don’t vote and the voters put in the time but at the same time they don’t have any proposals and therefore pointless.

I have put forward a proposal to build onto the NNS as a staker to participate and increase our rewards to build on the NNS and its future needs and not 1 reply. The teams have their hands full and the stakers don't participate.

Stakers want more rewards but don’t do any work to build onto the NNS other than to weaken, in my opinion.

Thanks @bjoernek Yes we kept the linear shape for the dissolve delay function instead of introducing a kink in order to not negatively impact the long stakers.
[/quote]

@nikhil.ranjan: Just to clarify, I meant that the proposal AltProp by @wpb would not introduce a kink because the whole function remains linear from start to end. The proposal from the start of this thread has a kink at the 6-month point where the slope changes.

This is correct if we assume that active vs non-active voting is the same across all dissolve delay buckets. However I would expect that long-stakers are much more active voters than short-stakers. Let me pull some data to verify this.

If the APY for 6 month stakers goes down from 10.9% to 7.2%, as proposed in the linear shape version, I suspect many 6 month stakers will dissolve neurons and shift their stake to Binance, with the result that, far from inducing more people to stake, the proposal will result in an exodus of stakers.

because curbing inflation is good for the price of $ICP in the long run.  Voting rewards are way too high compared to necessary.  you want high APY.  but that means $ICP will continuously decrease in price.  supply is increasing daily.  Don't use high APY to entice retailers.  we need low inflation mechanism and with the development of IC make $ICP increase in value.  Don't because APY is high it will look like a ponzi scheme that will kill the project when inflation is too high.  Supply pressure will result in always selling.
in other blockchain platforms, they only let APY 5-7% reward inflation.  and $ICP is having 20% ​​inflation.  Just like the more money is printed, the inflation increases and money is gradually losing value over time.

Just to make sure we are on the same page: the NNS APY is currently around 20% but the ICP inflation is NOT 20%. It is currently at 8.5% and dropping to 5%.

(See https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation)

This proposal would not affect at all the amount of ICP minted, only the distribution of what is minted.

I hope that makes sense.

From the @wpb 's AltProp argument implies that the proposal is not willing to give more voting power to participants that not 'maximalist' enough because not willing to stake for longer period (> 5 years), instead punishing the medium DD participants (< 5 years) by subsidizing their reward to short (<6 month DD) & longer term participants (>5 years) 
My argument is if ICP wants to be a general purpose ecosystem that onboarding many kind of participants from different background, it should give more fair voting power also to non-maximalist participants. This is to ensure, that the ICP goals are not just strategically for long term objectives, but also give more considerations & attention to achieve short-medium objectives.
From the NRProp vs AltProp, I see NRProp will be a better route. AltProp is a bit radical, and will stir disturbance for governance participants with DD < 5 years. 
If the AltProp prop argument is to encourage shot-medium DD participants to increase their DD to 8 years, I don't think this will be the case.

How do we feel, if this is really about dipping a toe in, lowering the xdr vote threshold to 7 days…maybe upping it to .1 instead of .01. This gives them the opportunity to try it out but the rate is super low and doesn’t shift much VP away from current stakers.

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-06-23 03:16:18 UTC | #177

Hello ICP community. Long time forum lurker.

Though I appreciate the communities’ intentions of garnering additional stakers to join the NNS, I’m afraid such a proposal is merely a band-aid solution for a more fundamentally driven one. Let me explain.

Let us fancy this matter from an outsider view. Pretend you are a newcomer to the ICP space. You are intrigued by the disruptive technology being built on the ICP platform. You are a bit frightened by the price history of the token, but for some reason, an insatiable urge to learn the technology drives you to consume the red pill. You have a general understanding of other blockchains; however, you are convinced $ICP is quite literally the future. You quickly hit the market buy option on your favorite exchange and are now faced with the dilemma – How can I earn rewards and participate in the DAO?

Let’s dive in. First one must create an “internet identity anchor” before having to log-in to the “Network Nervous System.” After said completion, you are left clicking the tabulated links on the top and eventually stumble on the word “cannister.” Eventually, after clicking around and searching various web2 sites (Tisk tisk…), you deduce this is the appropriate option to stake your ICP. Upon staking you need to determine your dissolve delay, and are further bombarded with things like “Increase Neuron Stake”, “Split Neuron”, etc. Do you see the problem?

If we as a community intend to drive user adoption of the NNS for staking, we need to put ourselves into the shoes of our common crypto-peers. Needlessly verbose terminology is such a huge turn off for newcomers. What appears to be the intent of creating a cult-like mantra around the use of novel words and nifty idioms is exactly what turns people off from wanting to participate. Perhaps as important - participants must think to drive their decision-making process. Think of every other user-friendly stake platform. You login, find the stake button, and then bam – rewards expressed as a percentage depending on your stake term.

We need an NNS that is so user intuitive, it’s a simple as logging into your favorite social media platform. Simply login, “Stake”, and set your term. When you are ready, you can “Unstake” or “rake your steak rewards.” (Folly, but an option. 8 Year gang baby!)

If you think this is ICP fud and crypto babble, I truly apologize. I’m totally engrossed with the technology Dfinity has built with ICP, and truly believe this has a chance to transform the internet as we know. However, we as a community must stop trying to create robust mathematical proofs to drive user adoption. Perhaps a greater emphasis on ease-of-use would solve that very problem instead.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-06-23 23:33:25 UTC | #178

I remember  it well and when you finally setup and in you become a bystander.

-------------------------

integral_wizard | 2022-07-03 11:10:57 UTC | #179

At the same time, what you are referring to can be understood in little time. There are official articles that explain it that takes like 10 minutes. You SHOULD NOT stake your money if you don’t understand the basics. I don't think it is too much to ask. We dont want a community of price-fixed/ yield hunting BAM BAM type of people who are living on a surface and can be convinced in minutes. These are the people who come in and out and dont really care about the project  and will easily flee and FUD when we hit different roadblocks. They bring unnecessary volatility which we dont need as we are and will be attacked anyway due to being a gamechanger. I urge the community to support newcomers but not get rid of critical education. At the core of governance are neurons. We should not think of yield, but of decentralized incentivized governance. 

While we welcome everyone i dont think we need to dumb everything down. Education matters. ICP is not a get rich scheme that is slightly better than the previous blockchain. It is paradigm shift. If you want to participate and earn generational wealth it is not too much to ask to get in touch with the terminology, imo.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-07-03 16:38:34 UTC | #180

Hey Integral,
First, thanks for your post. Greatly appreciate how this community is willing to engage in thoughtful discourse – regardless of agreement/disagreement. I have used some “Choice” words below – please exercise caution. I assure you this is not a personal attack, and hope my passion and love for this project is evidenced.

Perhaps I wasn’t clear enough, but your very point evidences exactly the issue I’m trying to highlight. Let me hash some of your key points (Sorry in advance - not yet keen on how people can pull out specific text for a reply)
1.	**“Official articles that explain it takes like 10 minutes.”**
****a.****	Problem 1 exhibited. It is my opinion it should not take 10 minutes to learn how to stake a “neuron”. There shouldn’t *be* a need to educate users on how one should stake – maybe no more than a minute. I’m not dragging an arbitrary number out of my bazoo for nothing – merely trying to illustrate the user needs to understand how to act in a fastidious manner. The interface should enable this quick understanding, not an educational video.
**b.**	Furthermore, perhaps you are a proficient crypto advocate who has been in the space for several years. Maybe you aren’t, and just have a high aptitude to digest critical concepts. I am not. There are many others who are not. We as a community should be striving to create a platform easy for anybody to use – without the need to go and find a full-feature solution on a web2 interface, no?... *Intensely* think about that for a minute in respect to the very investment you have made. ( I would be doing an injustice to the community If I didn't give honorable mentions to @cryptoisgood , @icpjesse , @BitcoinRenegade, @icpsquad, and the many others who have made videos on how to stake on the NNS. Know there are people out there like myself for which you greatly reduce the learning curve. Thank you, sincerely)

****2.**	We don’t want a community of price-fixed/ yield hunting BAM BAM type of people who are living on a surface and can be convinced in minutes. They bring unnecessary volatility which we don’t need as we are and will be attacked anyway due to being a gamechanger.**
**a.**	Curious then what your thoughts are on this very proposal – I.E, participants can stake under the 6-month threshold. Would that very proposal not manifest exactly what you are intending to avoid? FWIW – I have several neurons with different yield terms. Am I a poor proponent of the ICP ecosystem because I spread my investment across 6 month/1 Year/8 Year neurons? Of course not, and how ludicrous to think otherwise. This is merely my way of trying to diversify risk, avoid exogenous shocks x years down the line, etc. This is how investors think.
**b.**	When I came to the ICP space, I was relatively new to the “Crypto Space.” I’ve been an active participant in the equities market for quite some time and had been trying to digest the implications of crypto. In particular, I was trying to seek out a project that presented a unique use case in the future – something that empowered true utility, was light years ahead of the other technology in the space, presented an opportunity to extract market value from the likes of competitors, and had deflationary dynamics that *could be* construed as positive cash-flow-esque properties. I performed my research and made what I believe is a sound Risk/Reward opportunity. The ease-of-use for staking has nothing to do with understanding the underlying fundamental prospects this technology beholds. How are you connecting those dots? 
**c.** Not sure I totally get your point about how a simple change in wording would increase “unnecessary volatility”? If their ICP is staked, can you tell me how the underlying price dynamics would exhibit increased volatility? (I feel as though this is the vantage point you are alluding to – please correct me if I’m wrong)

****3.**	If you want to participate and earn generational wealth it is not too much to ask to get in touch with the terminology, imo.**
**a.**	To me, this is a poor cop-out excuse. We need to facilitate understanding of this technology *for everyone* – this is the future in which we both desire, no? How do you increase user engagement if a large proponent of users don’t even understand the terminology? They look at the price action history, briefly glance over the fundamental prospects, and stumble upon the words “Cannister, Nueron, Subnet, Network Nervous system, Threshold Relay, CKT, Service Nervous System, Noninteractive distributed key generation, an SDR that pegs a fiat basket converted into a derivative instrument used for computational throughput”… you truly feel that way? To me, this is entirely jargon. I’ve done my research and still feel as though I have a surface-understanding of what this technology beholds. 
I’m not expecting people to understand the fine intricacies of how a direct integration with BTC is feasible (Nor do I) – I’m seeking easy fixes to help users digest info as efficiently as possible.

-------------------------

integral_wizard | 2022-07-03 17:24:09 UTC | #181

Hey. Thanks for engaging. I feel there are some interesting points to dwell upon and some miscommunication as well.

I would say first that what we don't necessarily need right now (and support) in these delicate first years is "dumb" community and fast results/ greed. That is, people who don't understand what they are buying and not willing to do any research. If they are open to learning, different story, but many want fast results. This shallow approach is epidemic. This creates greed, leverage, easily manipulated emotions. Some other project comes in saying they do what ICP does but with better UI and they are gone spreading FUD. For example :).

The reason I care about this is because we are still so early and it is perfectly normal that few get new technology. Innovation doesnt happen in the mainstream. Now, ofc a better UX is better for everyone and all resources will get better with time. The wording, illustrations etc will get better. But I do believe that "simplicity without understanding" is not worth it. And for an investor, you need research first. If we talk about a 10 minute walkthrough of well-written terminology, is that really too much to ask? 

It's like building a company. Contrary what some might think, you DON'T want to grow too fast. Why? Because culture is smth to be built carefully, organically. Crypto is all about network, which is about the community. 

...
I recently posted a link to a Bitcoin documentary and someone asked me to make a small summary. Well, no. They are missing the point. Many still want fast results. Education is a journey, there are no shortcuts. Summary wont help understand Bitcoin which is entirely outside the box/ system invention. You need many many many hours to see the depths of it. I believe the same goes to IC. It is a gamechanger tech. It is Internet Reimagined. Understand the god damn terminology, if you want to be an investor.
...

ICP doesnt have staking, it has governance. While it does earn yield it is much more important to understand that this is a DAO governing the *whole* network. It is amazing. To be part of this, you need to understand the basics. For the yield, you need to have skin in the game, which means taking responsibility. You are literally voting (or following). Your vote matters. If one doesnt understand the basics (and I just mean best effort and curiousity), then maybe one shouldnt be part of the OG ICP. Maybe come back in a few years then?

Now, at many levels I agree with you. Im just offering another side of the story. I dont ask anyone to understand the mechanics of the revolutionary tech (although as you pointed, there are many of us who are covering this truly revolutionary tech), but the basics of NNS and the overview of network, yes. I dont think it is too much to ask from new community members. 

Just to be clear, I agree that we can make onboarding better. I think ICP will be increasingly well suited to onboard non-crypto people because of Internet Identity, being fully on-chain (unheard of) and having direct Bitcoin integration. So as we go forward, this transition should be smooth. But onboarding people to make an account vs governance is different. An additional price/ effort (time/ education) has to be paid to take part in this experiment. At the end, this effort is worth it.

Thank you for engaging and caring. Lets be part of history in the making 🙏.

Hey Integral,

Happy to engage, thanks for your prompt response (Sorry caught in the corporate jargon lol :sweat_smile:) This is a terribly babbled response – just wanted to get my thoughts out there before a July 4th Party – Happy early Independence Day to my fellow American friends :us: :sparkler:!!!

I know you are speaking holistically but let me preface with my personal take. I’m not seeking fast results, nor am I seeing a get quick rich quick scheme. I’ve performed my due diligence in this ICP rabbit hole, and continue to research. (quite literally on the daily) Yet still, I think there is an apparent disconnect with how the external crypto community views our project. They simply don’t understand. It is my belief difficult to understand terminology simply exacerbates this problem.

You bring up an EXCELLENT point, **“And for an investor, you need research first. If we talk about a 10-minute walkthrough of well-written terminology, is that really too much to ask?” –** 100% agree with what you are insinuating here.

Let me be transparent – this was not a 10-minute undertaking. This was a multi-week undertaking. (Just for the NNS…I’m quite *slow* in my deduction) Videos, journals, and articles were all utilized when trying to unravel “What in the absolute heck is the NNS?”

Research should absolutely be a prerequisite one employs when considering any investment vehicle. One SHOULD perform robust due diligence when trying to substantiate their investment thesis. ***This should not be construed as any type of financial advice nor insight, for which I am absolutely not qualified. I’m just a simpleton who loves ICP. This is simply how I asses’ personal investments.***

I’m certainly no dumbo, and conversely, no genius. I think I’m probably right in the middle of the bell curve. I believe our community severely underestimates the impediments our terminology imposes on potential NNS Stakers/Governance drivers. It just deters them to other services. Those people are still buying, believe me (hearsay). Just not joining our community on the NNS. 

I further believe our community has a fundamental misunderstanding of engagement. Selective wording of Nuerons/Stake and Cannisters/Smart Contracts **does not** degrade the projects undertakings. It just aligns crypto knowledge across the entire crypto ecosystem. This alignment will drive engagement. Put simply - I think there is a middle ground where *we enable* users to put their thesis to work. (This was my problem)

After purchasing my first ICP, I was still afraid to stake my liquid holdings in the NNS for quite some time. I’m not sure why – but I believe it has something to do with the “Scary” & “New” terminology. Why stake on the NNS when you can simply participate on *perhaps* an easier to understand centralized exchange? (Maybe not the appropriate analogy in recent times, but you get the point)

Which brings up an important caveat you expertly intertwined - **ICP doesn’t have staking, it has governance.** The governance drives the liquid democracy of our protocol. The yield is merely a secondary result of your contribution to the governance. I love your thoughts here.

Engagement with the community on *why* this governance factor is structurally fundamental to ICP is paramount. Something I will certainly think about more.

Cheers - and agree with you, history in the making :star_struck:

I sense we're on the same page. We are all learning, evolving and making the whole system better (including understanding it). Digesting, elaborating, marketing is smth where the community has a big role to play. I am glad we have you on board, learning and seeing the same as the ones before you. It's gonna be an interesting ride the next few years.

And to remain on topic, clarity is smth we can all strive for. Docs, UI, communication, etc. Key information for new folks (like Internet Identity, neurons, staking/ governance) should be easy to understand. Likewise, we shouldnt expect new people to come in and lock money for 6 or more months, hence lowering the barrier and benefit, while keeping things secure.

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-07-07 14:41:38 UTC | #184

Thanks for all the lively debate and engagement with the proposal. ICP community is very passionate. Very interesting points are raised here. In the final proposal all the community feedback will be considered.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-20 11:21:12 UTC | #185

Did anything ever come out of this? @nikhil.ranjan 

I believe short term staking is key for the growth of ICP.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-20 21:08:13 UTC | #186

I believe anything that mess with the tokenomics and the reward system should be studied and very hard to change. The NNS need to stop messing with this aspect of the protocol.

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-08-25 00:38:33 UTC | #187

Nearly finalized. @nikhil.ranjan is drafting the final proposal for NNS voting

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-25 02:31:39 UTC | #188

This and it should also require an higher threshold to pass

-------------------------

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-08-29 15:37:22 UTC | #189

Final proposal is posted here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation-next-steps/15164

wpb | 2022-09-26 16:10:11 UTC | #191

Have there been any estimates on how long it will take for the ICP staked by new participants in the 1-6 month dissolve delay bucket to match the new voting power that will start receiving voting rewards from existing dissolving genesis neurons that are not currently receiving voting rewards in this same bucket?  

Also, are there any plans to define and measure success of this proposal to know if this proposal works?  Can the dashboard be set up to display simple metrics such as new neurons in the 1-6 mo bucket that were not previously staked neurons vs dissolving neurons that entered the same bucket vs dissolving neurons that leave the same bucket?  

It seems useful to know what participants receive these new 1 - 6 mo voting rewards.  Certainly it will be dominated by dissolving genesis neurons in the beginning, but it would be nice to see a trend that shows we are attracting new participants.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2022-09-27 07:59:49 UTC | #192

I think a nicer solution is for neurons to receive rewards all the way down to dissolve delay (DD) of 0, provided that at some point their DD was > 6 months, with the caveat being that once a neuron's DD is < 6 months it cannot be locked and its DD cannot be increased unless it is increased to at least 6 months.

This way people can stake for 6 months, start dissolving immediately, and get decent rewards the entire time. Currently, a massive deterrent for short term staking is that you have no rewards for the final 6 months, and in the proposed plan the situation isn't much better because the rewards for the final 6 months are tiny.

My proposed solution is fairly simple to implement too, each neuron would need a new flag stating if it is eligible to vote. This flag starts as false and is set to true if at any point the DD is increased to > 6 months.

I feel like this would benefit a bunch of dissolving seed investors to everyone’s expense. Next 1.5 years has a lot of passive dissolving seed investors unloading their investment

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2022-09-27 07:01:11 UTC | #194

I like this a lot. Maybe open an extra topic for it while the current proposal is open for votes?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2022-09-27 10:35:15 UTC | #195

I think giving a few seed investors those 6 months of rewards is a small price to pay for making the system better and simpler especially for new comers who just want to try out some staking.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2022-09-27 14:01:04 UTC | #196

If this proposal passes, it should wait to be implemented until after the large quantity of dissolving ICP from seed neurons finishes dissolving.

-------------------------

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-09-27 14:55:01 UTC | #197

Ok, we will wait for seed neurons finishes dissolving.

-------------------------

nikhil.ranjan | 2022-09-27 14:55:45 UTC | #198

This topic is open and good enough for discussion.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-09-28 00:20:57 UTC | #199

I'm in favor of this proposal. The benefit to seed investors is short lived, but the long-term benefit to the IC is greater. Anything that reduces the complexity barrier and invites greater participation, is a win.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2022-09-28 00:32:11 UTC | #200

Compare with Est.APR in Binance, Can't imagine short stakers have motivation to try out governance in NNS🧐

8yeargangDAO vote NO

willguest | 2022-09-28 13:31:41 UTC | #201

I am somewhat conflicted about this proposal. While I agree that 8-year lockup is not sufficiently rewarded compared with 6 months, I also really like the longer term investment perspective that an 8-year lockup requires. This is reflected in how my own neurons are set up, with some at 8 years and others 6 months.

I would expect the shift to a shorter minimum term to lead to more volatility in ICP's price and, while I see the argument for greater inclusion, I would agree with @MillionMiles that there are better offers around.

On balance, I vote to reject.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-09-29 08:25:46 UTC | #202

Yeah I voted yes, but I'm in favour of making it even simpler for new users if possible.

-------------------------

lhblty | 2022-09-29 08:34:58 UTC | #203

I'll vote against in the bear market, on the contrary I'll vote for in the bull market.
