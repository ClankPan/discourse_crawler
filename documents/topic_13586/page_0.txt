## TL;DR

* To encourage additional users participating in the governance process of the Internet Computer we suggest adjusting the rules for the minimum dissolve delay and dissolve delay bonus for neurons.
* In particular, we suggest that the minimum dissolve delay for voting should be set to 7 days (instead of 6 months) and the dissolve delay bonus should be extended by a linear function with values between 0 and 1.0625 for the time between 0 and 6 months.
* As a consequence, new users will be able to try out the governance process due to the lower minimum dissolve delay, while still keeping the incentive for users staking for longer periods due to much higher voting rewards for long-term staking.

## Background

* The voting power of a neuron is computed as the product of the staked amount, the dissolve delay bonus and the age bonus.
* The dissolve delay bonus is a value between 1 and 2 and a linear function of the dissolve delay (which has a maximum value of eight years). The current minimum dissolve delay for making a neuron eligible for voting and receiving voting rewards is 6 months.
* Currently, a neuron with a dissolve delay of 6 months has a dissolve delay bonus of 1.0625. A neuron with a dissolve delay of 8 years has a dissolve delay bonus of 2.
* For a detailed description of the Network Nervous System and the determination of voting power please refer to this [article](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8).
* With a lower barrier to entry, we believe that more retail participants will be able to experience the entire workflow of staking ICP, casting votes and accruing voting rewards Our hypothesis is that the proposed change described in the next section will significantly increase the number of community members participating in the IC governance. We also believe that over time some of these community members will start committing to longer staking periods that offer larger voting rewards.

## Proposal

* To encourage additional users participating in the governance process we suggest that the minimum dissolve delay for voting should be set to 7 days instead of 6 months.
* Given that we would like to keep the current incentive to stake for longer time periods greater than 6 months (which fosters long-term thinking for the participation in governance), the dissolve delay bonus between 0 and 6 months should be much lower compared to longer periods. As a simple solution we suggest that the dissolve delay bonus should be extended by a linear function with values between 0 and 1.0625 for the time between 0 and 6 months. From 6 months to 8 years the dissolve delay function should be unchanged as we do not intend to change the existing reward structure for staking beyond 6 months. The new function is illustrated in the following chart.

![Screenshot from 2022-06-07 17-38-52|690x400](upload://tx7Lp5LhA1hFN2dxeIJtwaFWpSW.png)

* For a newly staked neuron, this would result in APYs depicted in the following chart. The values for 7 days and 1 month are new (previously the APY was 0% as no rewards were given) and the values for 6 months and 8 years are unchanged.  

![Screenshot from 2022-06-07 17-39-47|690x431](upload://PbNdHH5I3My0Pw9PJSk8vmBjO0.png)

## Security

With respect to a 51% attack on the voting power of the internet computer, we believe that the proposed change is not relevant. If an attacker has 51% of the voting power, then also the minimum dissolve delay can be adjusted. Thus an attacker would stake for 8 years (instead of staking for a shorter period) receive a dissolve delay bonus of 2 and then change the rules.

With respect to the implementation, we consider this to be a security critical feature as it has an impact on voting rewards and thus the minting of ICP. Therefore it is planned to be reviewed with DFINITY’s security team.

## Alternatives considered

* With respect to extending the function for the dissolve delay bonus to the time between 0 and 6 months, we also considered concave and convex alternatives. A concave (respectively convex) approach would provide higher (respectively lower) voting power and APY compared to the proposed linear function. Given that the precise choice turned out to be irrelevant for a 51% attack as outlined in the section Security, we concluded to use the simplest approach via a linear function.
* We also considered using a linear dissolve delay function without a change in slope at the 6 month point. This would either imply a fundamental change of the dissolve delay function beyond 6 months (which would be a fundamental change to the overall tokenomics) or a very high dissolve delay bonus for periods below 6 months (which would weaken the incentive to stake for longer periods). Both of these alternatives were considered to be not desirable.

Very sensible proposal, it should pass

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 19:30:43 UTC | #4

I have a few concerns about this proposal:

1) I don't believe it will attract many new users to the NNS, the APY is too low, exchanges offer higher APYs for ICP with less effort for the user.

2) It introduces potential risks to governance, 6 month is an appropriate amount of time to lockup cause usually proposal are actioned upon in that period of time, so if someone votes against the network's best interest, he isn't able to liquidate the stake before negative effects start to happen. 

3) If APY for existing staker won't change where will the required tokens come from? Increased yearly inflation?

4) 7 days is just too low as a minimum lockup period, it would mean giving away free tokens and voting power to users who don't really care about IC's future and just want to earn a couple bucks.

I believe we should look again into https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters/8661 to incentivate more users to stake in the NNS

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-06-07 19:58:38 UTC | #5

1.You underestimate how many people want to be a part of governance.

2. This would take a whale to buy up a huge percent of supply just to do this attack. 

3. Isn’t this percentages and apy would lower by percent of active users. 

4. Disagreed

Idk how it's going to turn out. I do think it's worth trying. Given the significantly reduced multiplier I think this is a safe approach.

In this case the stakeholder would need a significant amount of VP to really influence anything. And the rewards at 7 days would be negligible. So i think it meets their intent of providing users a low-risk option for participating in governance.

1) You underestimate how many people don't care about governance and just want to see their balance go up, as an IC maxi I'd rather get more ICP and ignore governance altogether than contribute a raindrop in a game where whales have barrels of water.

2) Not necessarily, let take https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623 as an example, the proposal is about to be published on the NNS, whales know it will be a close match, so they buy couple millions of ICP just to increase their chances, proposal ends and they dump the tokens. 

3) Maybe I'm missing something but this is whats stated in the proposal
>From 6 months to 8 years the dissolve delay function should be unchanged as we do not intend to change the existing reward structure for staking beyond 6 months

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-06-07 20:27:54 UTC | #8

1. People probably don't care about governance, but they care about money. We need to align incentives to encourage them to participate. 

2. 7 days is still a long time to risk millions of ICP knowing there are other people who are not staked who can dump on you while your token is locked. Perhaps it should be more than 7 days but 6 months is a huge commitment that many are not willing to make. 

I support the proposal.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-06-07 20:29:00 UTC | #9

I'm not sure that a second linear scale is needed, beyond the additional complexity it introduces. If 7 days stakers had 1.0001x voting power, that seems fine to me. Otherwise, why is anyone going to stake for 7 days if the resulting voting power is 0.001x or something similar? Is the proposal intended to allow people to demo governance, or meaningfully participate on a short-term basis?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 20:30:30 UTC | #10

1) Agreed but with that in mind would you rather stake on the NNS and get 0.5% APY or on Binance with higher APY and no need to self custody? Especially as of now with the low security of Internet Identity staking on the NNS for such a low APY isn't worth it.

-------------------------

janman1970 | 2022-06-07 20:30:32 UTC | #11

I'm in favor of short term staking with periods from 7 days to 6 months but think voting (and higher rewards) should be a privilege reserved for those staking at least 6 months, especially for governance proposals. If someone wants to experience voting, they could stake 1 ICP for 6 months and not start the dissolve. That would let them participate and see how the rewards pay out in relation to their activity, knowing that longer staking means greater rewards. They may then choose to increase their stake and/or staking period or they may choose to dissolve and cash out. It's low risk for them to get their feet wet, and no risk for the NNS (yes, I realize there is low risk for the NNS already).

Enable short term staking between 7 days and 6 months with variable APY, which also would continue to provide rewards for those who have staked much longer but are in the final 6 months of their dissolve. No voting, no increased voting rewards.

You’ve stated in the past the security concerns associated with awarding VP to neurons with dissolve delays less than 6 months. This make me curious why you’re suggesting to keep the dissolve bonus at 1 for 7 day lockups?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 21:03:18 UTC | #15

I disagree, what you're proposing goes against one of the premises of the NNS, we get rewards cause we vote on proposals, I don't see why short term stakers should be rewarded for doing nothing.

>You’ve stated in the past the security concerns associated with awarding VP to neurons with dissolve delays less than 6 months

I would also like to know why Dfinity chose to do 6 months minimum lockup in the original design and only now has decided to make this change. 
The way I see it, ICP staking was originally designed to do 2 things: 
1) require voters to have skin in the game and reward those who are risking more 
2) create a sort of deflationary mechanism by removing tokens from circulating supply.

The proposed change goes against both.

Honestly to me it seems like a desperate attempt to get more tokens in the NNS, but what's the point if the lockup period is low? Also is it cathering to that many people? 
Holders who want to receive interest on their tokens have better options, holders who want to participate in governance can lock a much smaller sum and get higher VP.

I also doubt there are many holders who care about governance that haven't staked yet cause the lockup is too high, it's anecdotal but the ones I've spoken to are more worried about variable APY and constantly changing tokenomics than 6 months lockup.

[/quote]

My personal anecdata (which one is welcome to dismiss away) is that there is a simple UX blocker for a lot of non-stakers where they want to go through the mechanics of staking to see the whole process from start to finish (from locking to voting to spawning to dissolving to disbursing) before staking to make sure they grok it.

This is equivalent to “let me send someone 0.01 ICP, make sure they receive it, before I send them the next amount.”

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-06-07 21:08:03 UTC | #18

I would probably be in favor of this proposal, as it is low risk and could potentially encourage more staking.  However, one important drawback of this proposal that isn't being discussed is it would instantly increase the amount of voting power on the network, thus reducing the APY for all stakers, and increase it in neurons that have low incentive to participate in good faith governance.

There is currently approx. 24M ICP that is dissolving on the NNS with less than a 6 month dissolve delay.  These are mostly genesis neurons that have chosen to dissolve.  They currently receive 0 vp.  In addition, there is 2.6M ICP that is locked for less than 6 months.  These are genesis neurons that were never claimed (and thus are still locked) and have an age bonus of about 1.15.  They currently also receive 0 vp.  Should this motion pass, approx. 18.4M voting power would be granted to these neurons, approximately 4.4% of total voting power.

Can't this be resolved by making tutorials or by staking 1 ICP for 6 months? I could understand if it were a year ago, but 1 ICP isn't that expensive currently, if they just want to see how it works there are better ways than changing the staking mechanism imo.

1. I agree with you that Tutorials totally could address the intent. I have a bias towards making things more interactive and exploratory, but as someone who has written lots of tutorials and docs, I clearly think they help.

2. Not sure this would satisfy intent. 1 ICP would not satisfy intent because it would take a long time for someone to accumulate enough maturity to spawn a neuron. With this proposal someone could stake 100 ICP, spawn maturity snd dissolve all within a few days..

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 21:18:45 UTC | #22

2) I see, but thats a pretty minor concern, spawning a neuron requires a button click, again not worth changing staking for in my opinion.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 21:30:12 UTC | #24

My two cents worth…

Yes I’m 100% in support of short-term staking but it needs to be competitive with what exchanges are offering if we want that ICP on the NNS instead.  Otherwise, it won’t change anything.

I’m not in favor of giving short-term stakers voting power as they will not be long-term focused with regard to the platform.

As it stands I can’t see long-term stakers voting to take ICP out of their pockets for the benefit of people staking short-term especially if they gain voting power.  Remember those who would benefit the most currently cannot vote on this.

My proposal to modify the proposal…

Allow staking with 30 day lockup to earn rewards to get that ICP on the NNS vs the exchanges.  

Make that rate competitive, not equal, to the rates the exchanges are offering.

Allow them to gain aging bonus so a neuron with 30 day lock for a year earns more than a new 30 day locked neuron.

Don’t allow these short-term stakers voting power.  Either it’s enough voting power to impact voting or it’s not and will not be an issue if it’s not there.

Agree 100%…don’t think we should frame it as testing governance which in my opinion most people don’t care about.

It’s about rewarding and attracting short-term stakers which I’m not sure these rates achieve.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 22:01:05 UTC | #28

I do think it would be good to attract short-term stakers from exchanges who technically still own those tokens and could potentially use them and their voting power in a negative way.  

However, I agree people aren’t staking on exchanges for voting power.

Imagine giving exchanges holding millions (10s of millions?) of tokens more voting power for staking short-term.

[/quote]

I want @nikhil.ranjan to gut check me and confirm, but I believe his intent could be reduced to:

1. We want more people staking and participating 
2. We do not want to cause more inflation
3. He asked around and found people were interested in staking but were dissuaded by the hurdles and mechanics.
4. Nikhil wants to address the mechanics so more people experiment… but wants to have a minimal reward footprint.

So in short, it is partly letting people play or “try out” governance, with some small probability that some people stake at sub-6 months, happy with the lower rates.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:03:10 UTC | #30

Exchanges don't actually stake the tokens, they lend them out so traders can borrow them with futures, for this reason there is no way the NNS can offer short time stakers a competitive APY without substantially increasing the yearly inflation.

-------------------------

Ok if they aren’t now then isn’t it reasonable to think they might if they could for <30 days?!

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:06:36 UTC | #33

Doubt, the premium for lending tokens is way more than the APY for 30 days staking.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 22:07:39 UTC | #34

My view on this is that people can easily test with 1 ICP for 6 months.  

However my suspicion is that most people are more interested in staking for rewards and not governance.

The hurdles I suspect are having to vote to get rewards…

Not much of an hurdle, you just have to set up the neuron once, what's problematic is historically price has been dumping so many don't want to lock the tokens for a low APY which could get lower in a matter of hours.

There is a huge demographic of people that hate exchanges and don’t want to keep their money there.

But also they don’t want to own a token that doesn’t pay passive income.

But also don’t want to be locked in for 6 months.

This demographic is what we capture here

Should’ve added liquidity as a hurdle too…which is my point on previous comments.  People don’t care about governance…they care about rewards and being able to access funds in a relatively short period of time ~30 days.

Full disclosure I have my ICP locked for 8 years and I manually vote daily.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:15:25 UTC | #41

The potential risk has always been there, I think what happened on the 31st December scared away lots of potential stakers, with DeFi and Liquidity pools coming holders would rather get APY there with less restrictions than by staking in the NNS, cause truth be told spam proposals are the only thing making staking worthwhile at the moment.

I don’t think it’s really fair to say people don’t care about governance. I care about governance a lot and if I could see myself staking smaller amounts just to participate. I also like this option because I’m currently sitting on some unstaked tokens that I’d rather earn some interest on while I wait to see where the market goes

> I’m currently sitting on some unstaked tokens that I’d rather earn some interest on while I wait to see where the market goes

That's what I don't like about this proposal, staking ICP should be a commitment not something you do while waiting for a better opportunity.

My comment is on the target market of this proposal…those not currently staking on the NNS.  They don’t care about governance.  If they did they’d be staking on the NNS.  They care about APY and liquidity.

I also have idle ICP sitting on the NNS and that’s why I’d be in favor of some rewards but not voting power for it.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-06-07 22:29:35 UTC | #50

But my understanding of the target audience was simply individuals who wanted to participate but didn’t want to commit to 6 months. I do believe these individuals exist and I don’t see how providing this option hurts anyone or anything given the proposed linear change

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:31:14 UTC | #51

For the reasons I stated above, NNS is based on this risk/reward balance and tokenomics are helped by the reduced circulating supply, "earn some interest on while I wait to see where the market goes" goes against those principles, let's leave this mentality to stablecoin stakers.


Yearly inflation is a price every ICP holder pays out of his own pocket to have a functioning governance system, we should use it in the best way possible instead of gifting it to stakers who only want to earn interest while waiting for better opportunities.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:34:08 UTC | #53

I'm not saying stakers should never dissolve, just that there is a pretty big difference between getting your money back in 6 months/8 years and 7 days, the former is something you do if you truly believe in the projects long term success, the latter is something everyone would do cause why would you say no to free money?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-06-07 22:35:30 UTC | #54

But the rewards are proportionally reduced. So I’m not understanding the issue.  For example, 7 days is practically 0

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 22:37:39 UTC | #55

Yeah this is where we differ…I don’t think those people should get to participate in governance but they should get a small reward, relatively, for staking on the NNS and helping to secure the network like every other PoS.

Think I’m probably somewhere in between you and @Zane…

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-06-07 22:37:45 UTC | #56

Maybe I’m wrong. But it seems like everyone is simply taking issue with the concept of rewarding short term (non-committed) stakers without considering the actual risk/reward being proposed.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:38:26 UTC | #57

See it this way, I'd have to trust a project quite a bit to lock my tokens for 6 months in it, the IC is the only one I believe in enough to convince me to do such a thing, 7 days on the other hand is a short period of time, I'd lock all my crypto holdings for that amount of time even if it gave 0.1%, after all its free money. So instead of rewarding actual believers in the project, we rewards randoms who got nothing better to do with their tokens for the time being, even if it's 0.5%, I believe those tokens could be better used.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-06-07 22:40:09 UTC | #58

Idk. I’d rather have these randos tokens locked in the NNS for 7 days rather than sitting on the exchange contributing to the circulating supply. That’s not my primary motivation but it is a positive in my mind

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-06-07 22:41:37 UTC | #59

On behalf of @nikhil.ranjan I can confirm that this is the intent of this proposal. 

As rightly pointed by different community members there are multiple potential ways to achieve this goal. These could include expanding educational activities on the benefits of staking, promoting staking with 1 ICP, reducing minimum staking time etc. 

The presented proposal is our hypothesis on what will drive the maximum impact. Based on our discussions (anecdotal) we found that there are several people that are sitting on the sidelines due to 6 month minimum lockup requirement. We feel shortening the duration will enable them to get some real skin in the game when they start to see accrued rewards (staking 1 ICP wouldn't really have the same impact). 

Our intent of this discussion is to help capture your feedback:
1: Is this an idea even worth considering? (or are there better alternatives)
2: If this is worth a shot what could be the right minimum (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, etc.)? The minimum staking time is absolutely up for discussion.
3: What other challenges do we see (a great point was raised by @Kyle_Langham above regarding the currently dissolving and unclaimed neurons)? Any other such things that we are missing

At the end of the day we hope to learn from the community feedback and iterate on the proposal as needed before taking it up for voting.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:41:50 UTC | #60

In my opinion if we care about IC's success we should look into better rewarding long time holders instead of wasting time trying to attract opportunists so we can boast about having a higher % of tokens locked in the NNS, who cares if 99% of tokens are locked if half of it is locked for 7 days?

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 22:43:14 UTC | #61

Again, I support rewarding short-term stakers however I do think it should be a minimum lock of 30 days and they shouldn’t get voting power.

As for the rate for the short-term it should be proportional to a 6 month lock.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-06-07 22:44:24 UTC | #62

But why not voting power? I’m not trying to be difficult; I just don’t understand. It’s reduced linearly to 0. So why not? What negative impact would it have?

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 22:51:01 UTC | #63

Either the voting power is worth it or not…

If it’s worth it then I don’t want someone only concerned with short-term risk voting and having an impact…what happens if there’s 100m combined staked short-term only?!

If it’s not going to have an impact then why is it needed?!

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-06-07 22:52:10 UTC | #64

To allow potential stakeholders to try it out. Give them a taste for governance. Rather than simply handing them rewards.

-------------------------

Lomesh-dfn1 | 2022-06-07 22:54:14 UTC | #65

The APY rewards are a function of the voting power so it cannot be zero. In the proposed model the voting power for someone staking for 7 days will be ~ 1/25th and 30 days will be ~1/6th vs. someone staking for 6 months. That way the stakers won't have much significant impact on governance proposals when staking for short duration and they will always find it motivating to increase their minimum lockup to at least 6 months.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-06-07 22:55:50 UTC | #66

Binance has a 10 icp limit

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 22:57:28 UTC | #67

If that’s the case they’d stake for 6 months now?  And 6 month stakers would be increasing to 8 years…but that’s not happening because people don’t want to commit…

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-07 22:57:32 UTC | #68

10% at 30 days lockup has a 5k ICP limit unless they recently changed it

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 23:07:29 UTC | #69

Again if it’s about governance then they can test for 1 ICP for 6 months…but the rebuttal is it takes awhile to get maturity to spawn a new neuron…so it’s about rewards.  

And if it’s about rewards and short-term gets a low return based on voting power being close to zero then the point is irrelevant because it’ll also take awhile to spawn a new neuron…unless the rewards are disproportionate which most people will disagree with.

-------------------------

Lomesh-dfn1 | 2022-06-07 23:08:02 UTC | #70

The increase in voting power (/rewards) when moving from 7 days to 6 months are very significant (26X). Our hypothesis is that this will motivate enough people to graduate to longer dissolve delays once they are comfortable with a lower barrier to entry.

-------------------------

Lomesh-dfn1 | 2022-06-07 23:15:25 UTC | #71

The assumption is that this will give motivation for people to start with some reasonable ICP (not just 1). Someone with a couple of hundred ICP can find it worthwhile to start with 7 days and then increase dissolve delay quickly once they become comfortable with the process.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-07 23:34:00 UTC | #72

It would take 233 ICP with a dissolve delay of 7 days to earn 1 ICP in a year…assuming they follow and vote on every proposal.  That’s not really short-term…

People who don’t want to commit to the risk of 6 months dissolve delay probably also aren’t going to invest ~$1700 for a year to earn a few bucks.

So what is the objective?  To increase staking on the NNS or get people to try governance?!

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-06-07 23:40:37 UTC | #73

The objective is to create a way for people to stake without exchange. We need people off exchanges and this helps . Even if only 5 % of people do it that’s a win.

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-06-08 00:00:44 UTC | #75

The goal here is to attract more people to participate in governance. I cannot comment on the viability of the investment upside but I do know that there are several people who have ICP but haven't been staking due to the 6 month threshold. Maybe they think they may need liquidity before 6 months. We need to bring them to participate in governance because then once they see the activity in the community and the NNS in action they will feel gain more confidence with the potential of IC.

They may think 7 days voting power may not be worth it and may want to try with 30 or 90 days.It's not about 7 days or 30 days or 3 months, I think it's mainly about giving people more flexibility to choose with a lower barrier to entry.

Wouldn't the onus be on Dfinity to code the change? 
If so, how much time would this take?

Assuming that this is going to be a complex change: I don't want Dfinity behind on their roadmap any further than they currently are for something that doesn't immediately improve the network. This proposal just hopes to incentivize some tentative people to stake and we *hope* they lock for longer periods of time, I can name plenty of things on the roadmap more immediately important than this.

If we still have less than ideal NNS #'s after both integrations are complete then maybe we should come back to this, but this seems very premature considering the overall market hasn't been in the IC's favor since Genesis either. We only have the bear-market data for NNS staking.

Very reasonable question. I will let @nikhil.ranjan answer whether it is a trivial change (change a parameter) or whether it’s something more involved. That can certainly inform the community.

This makes sense. 

To make sure we give authors @nikhil.ranjan and @Lomesh-dfn1 all the due nuance, their hypothesis is NOT that getting more 7-day stakers is good. Their hypothesis is that there will be more long term stakers if the funnel of people who play with staking is widened (classic funnel logic).

Now to make sure your case is well understood (which I think is a good one):

1. Their hypothesis is that more people playing with staking leads to more long term stakers. Do you disagree with this hypothesis… or think their goal is not the right one (increase participation of long term stakers). I could not tell if you disagree with the goal… or their way at getting the goal.

2. I may be misreading too much into your comment, but when you say “rewarding long term stakers”, I saw an implication you had some ideas. If not, I do not mean to put you in the spot, but I did want to proactively listen and make sure your POV is well understood with proper visibility.

-------------------------

anonymous | 2022-06-08 04:24:58 UTC | #81

Not entirely a bad idea, but even if it is allowed, the voting power would be pretty insignificant (I believe), but earing something is better than earning nothing. However, i feel they should not earn rewards unless they are staking for 6 months.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-06-08 05:27:57 UTC | #83

I'm not an expert in Securities, but I'm pretty sure this would hurt ICP severely on the Howey Test. 

The SEC could argue that ICP isn't purely a governance/utility token by making this change. Since short-term staking rewards wouldn't be reliant on governance participation, it would mean that short-term staking would be profiting on the future work of others with the expectation of monetary gain since governance wouldn't be the objective for short term staking. Even if this weren't entirely true, it opens the door for the SEC to make that argument, which I really do not like.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-06-08 05:47:16 UTC | #84

I recently left DFINITY as an engineer, and now I'm contributing to this forum as a stakeholder and community member only. I think we should encourage staking and voting by more participants, on simple terms.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-06-08 05:48:57 UTC | #85

When I finally set up an account on the NNS I felt like a weirdo and did what others did and transferred 1 ICP from my coin account and wanted to check out the NNS for the first time. It took me a week to get the feel and understand the different screens.

I found the documentation on https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_wiki
Here I found the official document to explain each button and the pages.

I was uncertain about the Neurons page and what I would do about setting a time delay. At first I set up the stake for a couple of days after the 6 month Dissolve Delay. From there I started to play with the Staked period and watched the adjustments made to The Voting Power. I also set up the Following Neuron Holders Selection but never started the Start Dissolving Button.

I had the choice then to start dissolving and wait for the dissolve period to end and by then I figured that I could even double my investment by the end if I had decided not to continue.

I decided to add 100s more to that same neuron and have followed the forum for more information and insight to Governance.

People who have spammed on the NNS have shown me that you can set up a neuron in my opinion with 1 ICP without a stake could then create a proposal that looks like a team proposal summary with code that could be damaging to the NNS or create a situation where they can write a proposal that earns many rewards for their other neurons that is clearly a spam.

I am still not sure if all proposal summaries are checked by a team member before the proposal is accepted by the community for damaging code before it is updated to the NNS or it is just updated because of the acceptance by all the community.

When I see someone say let's try a lower minimum stake period and see how it goes, like flying by the seat of my pants compared to the highly educated team of Dfinity, mmm.

For these reasons I will not accept any changes to the minimin staked period and have given my concerns about those who want to weaken the already well thought out Governance in place and will reject this proposal.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-08 06:04:54 UTC | #86

1) I agree on the premise, not sure about the execution, here is why: 

Say a DAO is designing a staking mechanism and decides to start with 8 years lockups only, after a while things aren't going good, so it's proposed to lower the minimum lockup time to 7 years, now the DAO has to trade a % of the stake reserved for 8 year lockups to attract more stakers.
Vote passes and it proves to be succesful so another proposal is made: lower minimum lockup time to 6 years, rinse and repeat. What I'm trying to say is everytime the DAO makes this trade, they decide to cut a % from the existing lockup tranches to attract new stakers, assuming the DAO is looking for price appreciation of the asset and functioning governance, at some point this trade won't be worth it anymore.

Why do I think the trade isn't worth it now:

Existing stakers already have a variable (90% likely to worse due to lower inflation and potential new stakers) and low APY on an asset that has historically performed badly, cutting yet another slice from already existing small pie really has to be worth it. From a financial point of view it's worth it as long as staking provides some form of deflation to the circulating supply, now what's this point? 6/3/1 month? Weeks? Days? Depends on who you ask, in my opinion not lower than 3 months. Maybe @Kyle_Langham could give us his opinion on this.

2) What I was referring to was an old topic of discussion: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters/8661 by @wpb 

I don't have anything to propose at the moment, tokenomics for me are a sacred aspect of the protocol and I don't have a background in economics or things of this kind, but I think changes should be rare and very well considered in all aspects, the data provided by @nikhil.ranjan seems incomplete from what  I see, where would the new rewards come from if the exisiting tranches are unchanged?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-06-08 05:53:09 UTC | #87

Do you remember what those were or have a link you can share? Would be interesting to hear Dfinity's opinion at the time on the matter.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-06-08 06:00:02 UTC | #88

After the implementation of this proposal, the reward multiplier for neurons locked for 3 months is 0.5 and the reward multiplier for neurons locked for 8 years is 2?

mechaquan | 2022-06-08 07:07:23 UTC | #92

And I’m saying that 0.43% to 1.73% ROI with voting power isn’t going to do that.

I think we are severely overestimating how many people want to participate in governance.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-08 07:58:41 UTC | #93

If you are worried about relying on the future work of others than you need to be pushing for the decentralisation of the development work because that is literally the future work of others that you are dependent on for future success.

I hardly think voting on mostly spam proposals constitutes as working for your rewards especially if you are just following other neurons.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-06-08 08:02:09 UTC | #94

I’m just using the percentage provided in the proposal…the point is it’s likely a lot of money for someone who is risk adverse to locking up for 6 months with very little return on a 1 year investment.

I would literally get a better return on my bank savings account with better liquidity an little risk of my asset losing value.

-------------------------

christian | 2022-06-08 08:40:03 UTC | #95

I will probably vote NO, because I think if somebody wants to "try out the governance process" they can stake just 1 ICP for 6 months and try as long as they want risking a couple of bucks.

PS: I would disagree with the maturity argument: AFAIK you can merge any amount of maturity, so you clearly can see how your ICP-stake is growing.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-06-08 08:42:02 UTC | #96

To the SEC it's black and white, staking with no obligations for payment is a trait of a security and there isn't any way around that. As long as voting is involved then you are part of the work and you get around that part of the Howey Test.

bjoernek | 2022-06-08 09:14:22 UTC | #97

Hi @Kyle_Langham 

this is a good point and below is my quantification of the impact of this proposal on the overall average APY.

**Summary** 
* The overall average APY would change from 15.72% to 15.46%. 
* Approx 2m out of 116mn daily rewards (i.e. 1.7%)  would be allocated to neurons with dissolve delay < 6 months.  -> The overall impact is relatively small. 

**Made assumptions**
*  An additional 27mn (24mn dissolving, 3mn non-dissolving) of staked ICP becomes eligible for voting/rewards (same assumption as you).
* This results in an additional voting power of 14mn. This is based on neuron data pulled today from the dashboard API, ignoring any age bonus (which would only affect the small porting of non-dissolving neurons). 
* I assume that only 50% of these neurons will vote on governance topics (to which the majority of rewards is allocated in the moment). This corresponds to the current relationship of active voting power vs total voting on the IC. 

**Calculation with data as of June 8th**
|Current APY||
|---|---|
|Total voting power|412,748,849|
|Daily voting rewards| 115,547|
|Total staked| 268,403,486|
|Current APY - Annualized voting rewards as % of total staked| **15.72%**|

|New APY||
|---|---|
|Staked ICP in neurons with dissolve delay < 6 months|27,000,000|
|New voting power|14,000,000|
|Assumed percentage of actively voting neurons|50%|
|New active voting power|7,000,000|
|New active voting power as % of current total voting power|1.70%|
|New total voting power|419,748,849|
|Daily voting rewards for neurons with dissolve delay < 6 months |1,927|
|New APY - Annualized voting rewards for neurons with dissolve delay < 6m as % of staked amount|2.61%|
|New APY - Annualized voting rewards for neurons with dissolve delay >= 6m  as % of staked amount|**15.46%**|

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-08 09:20:30 UTC | #98

I think this proposal is a waste of time and energy for very little if any gain.  Also who the hell wants to buy into and stake a coin that’s losing like 25%+ each month to get rewarded 2%.


Focus on fixing problems that actually matter first like getting more icp burned so the price stops bleeding that will get you way more participation than this proposal. Lol

Across the years, John worked on many parts of the stack. Currently, there are three other principal engineers at Dfinity, plus a few principal researchers and staff level engineers.

More concretely, I believe (John can correct me here), John’s last projects were around the Interface Spec and working on formal verification. Both of those projects were absorbed by the formal verification team (which consists of 3-5 people, depending on the project). John also spent the last few months helping NNS team and that work has been absorbed by the quickly-growing NNS team.
