`dfx` only allows you to configure one wallet per identity. Using `--wallet <wallet principal>` you can use any wallet with any identity, but for that you need to store the wallet principal somewhere else.

`dfx wallet addresses` lists what the currently configured wallet has in its address book. I honestly have no clue how the address book actually works.
