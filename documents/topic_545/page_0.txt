Hi team,

I was following the "Getting started" guide but neither "dfx start" nor "dfx upgrade " work and both issues seem to be related to SSL certs. Here are the details:

    % dfx start
    ⠁ Starting up the client...
    Mar 13 06:51:48.787 INFO Dfinity Replica Started

    ⠋ Replica exited with exit code: 101
    An error occured:
    AgentError(
        TimeoutWaitingForResponse,
    )

Strace-ing the dfx start execution I figured out that it tries to load a missing cert file, then it fails:

    open("/nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-libressl-3.0.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/etc/ssl/cert.pem", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

    ⠉ Checking client!

I also got the following error while trying the upgrade, somehow it cannot find the SSL certs even if I have both openssl and libressl implementations installed and all certificates are present in /etc/ssl/certs and /etc/libressl/certs

            ),

        ),
    )

DFX is a statically linked binary, I looked into it and there is a OPENSSLDIR variable that points to "/nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-libressl-3.0.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/etc/ssl" but I could not find a way to overwrite and since I don't have the dfx source code my debugging stops here.

My system is:
OS: Arch Linux x86_64 
Host: 81LF Lenovo Legion Y7000P-1060 
Kernel: 5.5.9-arch1-1 
Shell: zsh 5.8

Thanks icostan, nice investigating, there is a bug with dfx start at the moment. Could you please send this straight to the support channel at support@dfinity.org , that’s a good bit of trace info and should help the team resolve it.

same issue here on ubuntu 18.04 when trying `dfx upgrade` from version 0.5.2

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2020-03-28 19:31:33 UTC | #4

running `.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh` and installing the new version of dfx with `sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"` solved the problem for me

I'm having the same issue here on Ubuntu 18.04 when trying `dfx upgrade` from version 0.5.7
