Are you using WSL2?

Yes, I am. Everything seems great. But not sure what I'm missing out that it doesn't deploy

What is is the method to check if I'm using WSL2 or how to update?

Just double check you‚Äôre running dfx start alongside and there are no errors in that terminal. Restarting dfx with a clean state using `dfx start --clean` might help too.

Also check that you‚Äôre storing your projects within the Linux file system, eg under ~/my_projects/ and not on a mounted drive eg /mnt/d/my_projects. The mounted drive can cause permissions issues for files.

As for WSL, see further down this page to check the version, if it‚Äôs v1 you‚Äôd need to upgrade, there are details on that here too: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
