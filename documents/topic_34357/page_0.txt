On major exchanges like binance or coinbase you have the possibility to choose which network to use for sending tokens, e.g. sending USDC via ethereum mainnet, Base, Near, Solana, etc.

I noticed that ICP network is currently not supported, at least on the aforementioned exchanges. It would be helpful for users to have the possibility to directly send USDC to the ICP network using chain fusion and thus profiting from low transaction costs. Currently this is not possible since a user has to send USDC over ethereum mainnet in order to get ckUSDC and thus has to pay high gas fees. This conflicts with the low fee benefit of ckUSDC and other chain fusion coins.

Are there already initiatives/projects in the ICP ecosystem working on chain fusion integrations on exchanges?
