Here is a summary of the changes since the last release:

* [[7bf4cffbf](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/7bf4cffbf)]  Consensus: chore: remove bless and retire replica versions proposals

* [[8b20fb310](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/8b20fb310)]  Runtime: Validate method earlier
* Various tech-debt management: code refactoring, docs, bug fixes, test updates

# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires Mac/Linux/WSL2, Git and Podman on your machine.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout 2694487bb5594f68b43e1dc795142a8e48b45715
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/2694487bb5594f68b43e1dc795142a8e48b45715/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/guestos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

@pietrodimarco Welcome!

I am a community member who is attempting to reproduce the builds as well as review the release notes.  

A couple of overall suggestions:
(a) You might want to be more specific in context of what we actually voting for. Specifically we are voting for an update to the guestos. In that context, we are NOT verifying IC-OS as a whole. 
(b) Secondly and correspondingly, there is NO IC-OS disk image. There is IC-OS guestos disk image. 


Now on to release notes, 

1. I have a few questions; based on my findings (which are only related to RunTime for now). How should these be asked? Should I ask  them here tagging individual dev? Create an issue in git?

2. How we verify whether " Various tech-debt management: code refactoring, docs, bug fixes, test updates" have taken place or not?

The summary of my review notes are attached.

Reviewers for the CodeGov [project](https://www.codegov.org/) have completed our review of this [proposal 119318](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/119318), which can be found in the CodeGov [portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254565916/nns-proposal-119318).  The CodeGov [neuron](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100) has voted to adopt this proposal.  The Synapse neuron and Arthur's neuron have both voted to adopt this proposal as well.
