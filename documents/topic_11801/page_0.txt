# Summary

The DFINITY Foundation currently has 54MM ICP staked, giving it a relative voting power in the IC ecosystem of 22% as of March 30, 2022. This post goes into further detail.

# Background

As publicly listed, at network Genesis,[ the DFINITY Foundation got assigned 23.6% of the 469MM supply](https://messari.io/article/an-introduction-to-dfinity-and-the-internet-computer), roughly 110.6MM ICP. The Foundation staked part of this ICP, resulting in a voting power around Genesis of 38%, since less ICP was staked then than today.

As expected, not everyone who has ICP has staked yet. We foresee many more people staking. So the DFINITY Foundation has been deliberately and carefully choosing how much ICP to stake as it did not want to have too much voting power.

# Why the DFINITY Foundation stakes

We believe staking ICP is the right decision for a few reasons:

* It signals to the community that the Foundation is betting long term on the ICP ecosystem
* In the long term, the Foundation will use its rewards to finance its R&D for the network

That being said, the Foundation will be careful about not having too much voting power.

When it comes to determining an entity's relative voting power, there are two main factors:

1. The amount of tokens that an entity has and its neurons’ attributes such as dissolve delay and age.
2. How an entity compares to the number of ICP staked and the respective neurons’ attributes

We will examine both in this piece with regards to the DFINITY Foundation.

# Factor 1: Amount of tokens the Foundation’s neurons have

The DFINITY Foundation has the following neurons:

* Neuron IDs:
  * Voting:
    * 27
    * 2000-2055, and 4018-4037
  * Non-voting:
    * 4012-4017 are dissolving with delay less than six months
  * Dissolved:
    * 4000-4011
* Total ICP staked: 54 MM

Being practical, could the Foundation create more neurons? Yes, that is why we intend to have a dashboard which shows the community the latest data on the voting power of the Foundation.

# Factor 2: Amount of ICP staked in the NNS

The second factor is trickier because it depends on the actions of others in the ecosystem. If not enough people stake or even vote, the Foundation could find itself accidentally having too much voting power overall, which could discourage other entities and leaders from participating. That is why the Foundation has not staked all the ICP it could have.

To be concrete:

||Staked ICP|Voting Power|% of total|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|DFINITY|54,391,738|89,666,826|22%|
|Total||412,036,526|100%|

As more people and entities are staking, the Foundation believes it can stake more of its ICP, locking it away for years. Whenever the Foundation increases the amount of ICP staked, we will communicate it.

# Appendix: Voting Power and Full List of Neurons on March 30, 2022

To help add visibility, here is an API for voting power and a list of DFINITY-controlled neurons. 

## Voting power API

Furthermore, the IC dashboard API also exposes a query to reveal the number of DFINITY voting power at any point: 

[https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/neuron-voting-powers?step=86400&owner=DFINITY](https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/neuron-voting-powers?step=86400&owner=DFINITY)

`
{
  "DFINITY": [
       [
          1648770600, 
          8966682569112760.0
       ]
    ]
}
`

Where `1648770600` is a timestamp and `8966682569112760.0` is the absolute voting power.

AndyBrier01 | 2022-03-30 13:45:10 UTC | #4

This is really useful information thank you. Is it possible to add other named neurons to the neuron-voting-powers API call such as ICPMN and cycleDAO? I notice ICA is callable also.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-03-30 13:53:56 UTC | #5

I think I know how hard you guys have been pushing to make this public and I'm so glad you did!

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-03-30 15:43:11 UTC | #6

No, it's not possible to know *effective* voting power with followers, which is what you would want for community neurons like ICPMN and cycleDAO. The actual voting power of those two neurons is negligible (currently 20.28 and 25.38, respectively), so it's not very interesting to track that.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-30 17:55:26 UTC | #7

This is really helpful information @diegop.  Thank you so much for providing this clarification.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-31 01:36:07 UTC | #8

A moment of silence for the FUDders.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-31 23:24:52 UTC | #9

@Dylan is correct that the staked ICP that is owned by the ICP Maximalist Network neuron and the cycledao.xyz neuron is only about 10 ICP each with voting power of approx. 20 ICP.  This is similar to the Dfinity and ICA neurons 27 and 28, respectively.

However, it's important to be transparent about the voting power that is cast from liquid democracy when ICPMN and cycledao vote.  Since we are public known neurons, we have a lot of followers that cast their votes when we vote.  In my observation from dashboard data, when ICPMN cast our votes on each of the last three governance proposals, approx 8.3% of total voting power was cast at the same time.  In all three cases, the ICPMN and the cycledao neurons voted at exactly the same time.  This suggests that the cycledao neuron is currently following the ICPMN neuron.  In the early days of the daily governance proposals campaign, the cycledao neuron would sometimes vote before the ICPMN neuron.  In those cases, it appeared that approx 4.5% of total voting power was cast when the cycledao neuron would vote.

It is often difficult to tell how much voting power is cast by followers of these public neurons.  I think the best that could be done at this time is to expose the voting power cast for each proposal at the time each public neuron votes.  This would be misleading when public neurons vote at the same time because they would both show up as equal.  This would also produce different results depending on the order in which the public neurons vote because some followers have multiple public neuron Followees configured.  Nevertheless, it would offer some transparency to the governance influence of public neurons and it would be nice if that information could be provided on the dashboard.

I have a question: how Dfinity Foundation decide what governance proposal shall be voted or abstained? Is there a kind of principle?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-04-01 04:47:29 UTC | #11

It depends on the proposal. Our intent is to explain decisions a bit more, these links may be helpful examples:

Heihachi | 2022-04-01 07:26:19 UTC | #12

I dont find anything interesting to see neurons over 1mil icps to gain 440 icps daily while some cannot afford to buy 5 icps on exchanges

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2022-04-01 07:51:12 UTC | #13

Haha these guys have put in many years of efforts into the Internet Computer, so they deserve all that they get. Without them, there won't even be ICP tokens on the exchange for the poor guy to wish to buy.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-01 08:05:06 UTC | #14

I like this statement. I couldnt find anywhere else a better one to admitts that eventually icp is a closed lobby. Centralization in other words

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-04-01 08:58:53 UTC | #15

This is essentially how every Crypto with staking mechanism work. The guy staking 1 mill eth will have more than ETH daily than someone with 10. Does that mean distribution is centralized? Maybe but this is the only way a free system is going to work.  I don't get your complaint at all. It's like me complaining the mining far makes more money from BTC inflation than me with 1 ASIC.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-01 09:07:49 UTC | #16

No complaints. Just simple notifications of how easily some of them spends hundrends of icps to nft projects.
Tokens created from nothing with 0 value and distributed to few there is only one way to gain value, promotion. The best sector to do that is nfts. So spending 0 money, you can have any nft and give value to your icps by exchanging it with icps which were bought by real money. Not so fair, not so democratic and no so decentralized

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-04-01 11:56:22 UTC | #17

Good to see this, hope the team could provide more info regarding the token as well as how the team is planning to do using the tokens.

Update, Dfinity voting power is now on the dashboard: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-02 05:21:46 UTC | #19

This is the Biggest Change That Nobody Is Talking About.

-------------------------

ueyamamasashi | 2022-08-26 08:19:43 UTC | #20

It does take us a little bit out of voting power though,
Assuming that the remaining balance of approximately 56m ICP (110 - 54) has not been staked, what is the current balance and how is it being stored? I understand that you cannot disclose the specifics of the balance, but I think you should to some extent.
I have looked everywhere but could not find it. If this information is publicly available, let me know.

-------------------------

I appreciate DFinity for shepherding this platform to where it is today. You mean well for the community, and for that I am eternally grateful.

## October 5, 2022 Update:

Hi folks,

The DFINITY Foundation’s Finance team has updates to this thread:

In August, 2022, DFINITY merged maturity from neurons 2000->2009 with the parent neuron

  1. Total Maturity merged: 1,716,345 ICP
  2. This maturity merging had a direct impact on Total Supply, not on Circulating Supply. This increased Total Supply by 1,716,345 ICP.
  3. This will increase the voting power of DFINITY.

With the merging and locking activities above, DFINITY and ICA has increased its Voting power to 24-23.7% (up from previous 21.72%).


### Historical Context

On August 1, 2022, the voting power was 21.37% (Exhibit I).

**![|624x399](upload://1rjHLkTE1VOunmTMnbpcij8FxJl.png)**

On September 29, 2022, the voting power was 22.60% (Exhibit II).

**![|624x299](upload://3JiiMHxhCmYOY5jKJeMpVp7pTAz.png)**

On October 2nd, 2022 the Total VP reached 23.66% (23.7%) (Exhibit III)

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-10-06 16:35:08 UTC | #23

Why just 2000-2009? I notice that the maturity has not been merged back in for 2010-2055 and the remaining non-dissolved 4xxx neurons?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-06 05:48:56 UTC | #24

I am not sure, let me ping the Finance Team.

* Voting:

  * 2000-2055, and 4018-4037
* Non-voting:
  * 4012-4017 are dissolving with delay less than six months
[/quote]

Also, is there a reason why the 4xxx-4037 neurons (the neurons that still have > 6 months dissolve delay) don't vote on governance proposals, but the 2xxx do vote on governance proposals?

I cannot speak to SPECIFIC neurons, but I can say that in April the Foundation posted they would not vote with full voting power on Governance topics

[/quote]

An increase in circulation indicates an impact on circulating supply, not total supply. What am I missing? Or was it a typo?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-07 18:40:16 UTC | #28

Good catch @Denis . It is a typo. It should read:

This increased Total ~~Circulation~~  Supply by 1,716,345 ICP.

Fixed in the statement.
