I’m not sure if I’m asking the right form but I’ve been pondering this question. If a dev wanted to develop a local application game created within Unreal engine 5, would ICP be efficient enough to host the web services of this game?
Im talking about like a huge multiplayer game where lobby’s have around 100 people in them with minimal lag. I can’t find any info if ICP is capable of doing this. Are we at too early of a stage for this?

I guess my question was a stupid question that I’ll never know the answer to

Cannot be achieved :rofl:

I think it’s possible but it’s the lag time I’m worried about. I’ve been developing a game on my free time and just wanted to see if the icp is capable since I think that would be really cool to have a game on the PlayStation/Xbox store that’s hosted by the ic.

Product design to offset technical defects

No I think it's a reasonable question. I don't think that's something that is possible now. Way too early.

Understandable. Thanks

Hi @Jabberwocky and good question.
I don't think real time multiplayer game can work on the IC, because of the time an update takes (~2s) : block time resolution.
Queries on the other hand is pretty fast (~200ms) so the way I see it, your game needs to be somewhat asynchronous/not real time to be playable.

We just wrote a medium post describing our *companion app* approach to this issue.

To answer your question, the IC as it is right now might be efficient enough to host the web services of a multiplayer game but would certainly not meet the latency requirement for any real-time interaction game scenario. What you could do is either use a hybrid model where only NFTs and, generally, persistent data is stored on the IC or use an extended version of our WebRTC approach or the WebSockets approach that psychedelic has put forth recently.

I looked through your post on Medium, and I think you have already explained a lot. The documentation seems comprehensive, especially for linking a PC app to a web app on the same local network. This setup seems especially useful for your particular use case where you wanted the VR PC app to read NFT data. If you want to take a bit of a break, then chug along with me and play a couple of games, I've even prepared, found Slotsmagic coupon code https://casinosanalyzer.com/casino-bonuses/slotsmagic.com and now I need a partner for a good game. As for the efficiency of the Internet PC, it may be enough to accommodate the web services of multiplayer gaming. However, it may not meet the latency requirements for real-time interaction scenarios in games. In such cases, a hybrid model where only NFT and persistent data are stored on the Internet PC may be considered. Alternatively, an extended version of the WebRTC approach or the WebSockets approach recently proposed by psychedelic could be considered.
