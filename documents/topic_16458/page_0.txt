According to [Kyle's predictions](https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/death-by-node-rewards-part-2?s=w), if ICP prices fall below $3.5 USD, the incentives for node providers will likely cause ICPs to enter a death spiral.

ICP prices are approaching this dangerous boundary due to the depletion of liquidity and loss of confidence in the crypto market.

Therefore ICPL.app urgently calls the community's attention to the reward parameters for node operators, the proposal's demands include：
- The DFINITY Foundation should produce a report on node rewards as soon as possible, including a history of rewarding ICPs, with an assessment of the likelihood of a death spiral, which the community has a right to know.
- An urgent downward revision of the node's incremental rewards, or an update of a mechanism that dynamically corrects the node's rewards based on price.

This proposal does not have enough design details yet, mainly to wake up everyone in the community, and hopefully DFINITY will work with the community to solve the problem.

No, I think you are misquoting @Kyle_Langham. His post states very explicitly:
> With this context, it’s clear that $3.5 ICP (1M ICP) would not be a death kneel for ICP, as the inflationary pressures would be on par with already existing inflationary pressures. In fact, I would argue that prices would have to full MUCH lower than $3.5 to kick off any inflationary spiral.

Please note the **not** in the sentence. I think he just used $3.5 as an example as it seemed very low from when he wrote the article. Three important aspects:
- With $3.5, the NP rewards are still lower than the voting rewards.
- In order for any type of spiral to play out, the prices would need to remain in a potentially problematic area – much lower than $3.5 – for a long period of time (as in: many months).
- NP rewards are computed based on the average ICP/XDR rate over the preceding 30 days. Which also means that a sudden drop does not have a problematic effect.

We of course need to monitor the situation. But there is **no** emergency.

Why Nodes Op or  whales have to pay for low price? Why not all of us? If we do something we have to do it together not only one entity.
I will vote no to any proposal  that is not fair to all comunity.

Only my savings are in a death spiral. The Nodes providers are probably market manipulators. It's logical they keep a low price to accumulate more. They have money in everything, they don't care about quick money in ICP. They prefer accumulate low thanks to spiral inflation, gain more power and control on the network with more token, and when they will have enough power, they will make it pump. It could takes years. However, for sure, they will not let ICP to 4$ if the entire market pump.
Look at Etherum, Dogecoin... These fully controlled crypto are those who pumped the most. I'm not sure if I should expect that whales who associate their wealth with control will send ICP to the moon to save the liberty and democracy.... More the price is low, more they got ICP, and more they got ICP, more they can sell ICP... and more they sell ICP, more the price goes down... It's like the Dollar, everyone become more poorer, except those who control it... They print, they use, they print, they use... and us, we watch the value of our assets decline. More of that, market manipulators don't make pump crypto that a lot of people love. I remember how much they said doge was a scam... or remember EOS which was the crypto with the most investors.... Look where is EOS now. The boats never leave full in crypto. Lot of people are wrong thinking it should have more marketing about ICP... I'm sure that less we are to invest in, better it is... This is how I understand crypto market. People like us have no power to influence the market.

FranHefner | 2022-11-09 14:41:53 UTC | #6

I do a simple calculation (I don't know if it's exactly like that but it's how I calculated it)

----------------

## Supply

**Node Rewards -** 555k ICP minted in the first 5 months (average of 111k/month). The total value at the time of mint was $10.1M (average $2M/month).**

------
2 M USD / month
-----
Price ICP $6  
2 M -> 333 K ICP

Price ICP $5 
2 M -> 400 K ICP

Price ICP $4  
2 M -> 500 K ICP

Price ICP $2
2 M -> 1 M ICP

Circulating Supply
269,037,573 ICP

**1 M ICP/ month -> % 0.37 Total of Circulating Supply** 

**The impact is a very small** :white_check_mark:

Hi @blockpunk, thanks for your forum post and the conversation you are kicking off. I encourage you to continue the conversation and attention you are raising towards reward parameters, but I would also encourage that conversation to occur outside the context of a “node rewards death spiral”. DFINITY, including myself, do not believe this to be a likely outcome. As @bjoern correctly points out, the conclusion of the referenced article is contrary to the belief that a $3.5 price would trigger a death spiral. In addition, the referenced article was written prior to my joining DFINITY.

The relevant data for a death spiral is the number of tokens minted each month for node provider rewards, both in absolute terms and relative to other sources of inflation. Last month, DFINITY[ started publishing this data in a monthly report](https://medium.com/dfinity/nns-and-icp-token-metrics-monthly-report-sept-2022-d288e9ed3277) on inflation and NNS behavior. For September, 0.3M ICP were minted for node provider rewards, whereas 0.7M were minted for merged maturity and 0.4M were minted for spawned neurons (22% of minting in September were node provider rewards). The report also shows this data going back to January. The data for October, which will be published soon, is very similar to September. For context, over 3M ICP dissolves off the NNS each month as part of the pre-Genesis vesting schedules.

Moving forward DFINITY will continue to publish the inflation and NNS report on a monthly basis. I, of course, welcome feedback on that report structure from the community to help refine the report into a more useful tool for the community. A key metric to monitor in that report, for anyone concerned about a death spiral, is the absolute number of ICP minted for node rewards each month and whether it is increasing at an unsustainable rate.

tsetse | 2022-11-09 18:44:05 UTC | #13

At the time @Kyle_Langham wrote the first of his two posts regarding a death spiral, an ICP price of 3 USD was considered extremely unlikely. Now, we are almost there. Everyone hopes it will not go much lower, but there is no telling. If a token can fall 99.5%, it can certainly fall 99.9%. At some point, node rewards do become an issue.
I would therefore suggest that: 
1) Dfinity announce a plan (maybe they have already made it, but announcing it is important) that they will use their war chest to buy up as much ICP per month as is produced by node rewards. Since they have a grant corpus of 200 million USD, 24 million per annum will not strain the development budget overmuch.
2) The ICP purchased should not be placed in a long term stake, because that will centralise control further. Dfinity will forgo the staking rewards that come with the purchase, so that the coins remain liquid.
3) The purchase programme continues until the coin reaches a pre-settled price, perhaps 10 USD. After that point is reached purchases are stopped until it falls back to 3 USD. Hopefully that will not happen.
4) When the coin reaches an average price of 40 USD over a month preceding, Dfinity will sell 2 million USD worth of ICP. After that, it will sell that amount at the end of each month the market shows an average price over 40 USD.
5) By 2026, the programme should break even (say, 15 months of buying, a few months of no action while the price gets up from 10 USD to 40 USD, and then 15 months of selling) with an immense amount of ICP still in the bag. Once that point is reached, a decision can be made about whether the remaining ICP is to be sold in the open market or whether a new autonomous endowment is to be formed from the coins, which can then be staked... maybe even an NNS controlled Treasury.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-11-09 20:22:33 UTC | #14

I do think it would be wise to have a plan in place in case of an emergency situation, as we have seen multiple of these types of situations playing it in 2022.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-11-10 05:41:14 UTC | #15

I did a back of the envelope calculation of ICP sales in the month after genesis. By those rough numbers, around 90 million ICP tokens were sold between May 10 and June 10 at an average price of 166 USD per coin, totalling 15 billion USD.
We do not know how much Dfinity sold because lawsuits prevent them from telling us, and it is uncertain if they would have revealed it even in the absence of lawsuits. But there is little doubt that the Foundation was among the biggest beneficiaries of whatever manipulation might have been done by SBF and others.
The biggest losers have been all those who bought after genesis. Almost without exception, they are substantially under water. That is at least partly because the Foundation has wildly missed its announced deadlines for crucial upgrades. 
All of which is to say that Dfinity bears at least some responsibility for the lamentable price action, and obviously has the capacity to help remedy it to a degree. The plan I suggested will not involve any loss to Dfinity in the medium term, because it is almost a given that the price of the coin will be much higher than it currently is, unless a death spiral takes hold. I see an emergency programme of countering node reward inflation as a win-win for everybody, would like to hear counter-arguments.

It’s extremely likely that icp could drop below $1.25; and not even slightly unreasonable to expect below $1.00. And I’ll spare you all the worst case scenario, not sure how long you’ve been in crypto. What is the contingency plan should this highly probable scenario play out very soon?

-please note this price action isn’t even accounting for increasing inflationary pressure from node operator rewards resulting from decreasing price. Factoring that in makes a “death spiral” not just an understatement, but an absolute mathematical certainty.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-11-12 01:11:15 UTC | #18

Is it likely that will be under a dollar I don't know but we need to have discussions around contingencies to ensure that a death spiral doesn't occur under the worse case scenario.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2022-11-12 04:23:56 UTC | #19

How about a floor of $1 where if ICP falls below that, rewards are calculated as if it were $1 and not below it

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2022-11-12 05:49:36 UTC | #20

I believe Dfinity can and will protect ICP from this threat. At $1 the market cap would be low enough for the Foundation to repurchase as necessary. This would consequently limit decentralization for a time.

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2022-11-13 02:22:38 UTC | #21

Update: Dom [addressed](https://twitter.com/dominic_w) this idea today.

He apparently has ruled out Dfinity buybacks "for the users"; but I hope he would consider it for the survival of the project if necessary. Whether this would actually help, I don't know.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-11-13 09:29:55 UTC | #22

Yeah, he wrote a long medium post with a crazy market manipulation concept involving docking 30% from spawned rewards in a downturn, and linked that to a weird tax evasion plan which led Dfinity to push through a needless tokenomics change. That was fine because it was all to help insiders. But a plan which cuts inflation and helps the wider community while causing no long term loss to Dfinity is out of bounds. Figures.

-------------------------

robypsi | 2022-11-13 15:21:08 UTC | #23

The worry, and very real possibility here, is icp follows broader market structure, and from price action alone, not even considering inflation, price craters to a point where monthly node supplier rewards comprise a significant % of total supply. If we factor inflation here, with continued price action, in a very very short time we reach a point where monthly node rewards are a magnitude of order greater than total icp supply. This is an absolutely unrecoverable situation which will permanently halt the network. Do we not have a plan for this? If not, it *will* happen, the only question is when- 2 months, 2 years, 2 decades?

Terra/Luna was indestructible, *as long as* ust stayed above $0.90. Do we see the shocking similarity here???

If our only contingency plan is “price can’t go that low”, we will soon learn the price the market extracts for hubris.

Hello @bjoernek ,

I'm CC'ing you in this thread as per the dfinity teams page you are, "...an experienced quantitative risk modeler and manager with 10+ years of work experience in the financial industry. Prior to joining Dfinity, he worked at Credit Suisse focusing on models for credit risk and stress testing."
https://dfinity.org/

Given your robust expertise, it would be excellent if you/the foundation would be willing to publish a risk model on when the foundation thinks there *could* be impending risk from prevailing token price. 

The community needs to discuss preventative actions that are uniformly understood. Such an analysis would allow the community to conceive ideas that are relevant, & baselined to a data defined analysis.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-11-15 18:33:52 UTC | #25

Hi all,

Following up on questions raised in this channel on the connection of the ICP price and the minting of node provider rewards, I thought it would be useful to share the following analysis. The underlying calculations are in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUkALItFphIjvdEQ5qB1u5n3dm4JxMXdjXbQNbvhB_s/edit#gid=982964973).

**Conducted analysis**

* The NNS currently mints the equivalent of 1.38M XDR for all node providers per month.
* Based on that number, I have analyzed the relationship of minted node provider rewards and voting rewards under different price levels, including some extreme scenarios.
  * Today: ICP/XDR=3.00,
  * Scenario 1: ICP/XDR=1.5 and thus 50% down
  * Scenario 2: ICP/XDR=0.75 and thus 75% down
* For each scenario, I have analyzed the relationship of node provider rewards compared to total rewards, total supply and the daily trading volume of ICP.

![|624x387](upload://hzLjkvzXPTRc9XDBHOYL1k58a2W.png "Chart")

**Conclusions**

* The proportion of node provider rewards compared to the overall amount of rewards is relatively small. It varies between 12% for price levels as of today and reaches 35% for the most extreme scenario 2.
* Monthly node provider rewards compared to the average daily trading volume in Nov’22 are also small at 2.77% (daily trading volume= approx. 50M XDR as per [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/internet-computer))
* The proportion of monthly node provider rewards compared to total supply is 0.38% for the most extreme scenario 2 (ICP/XDR=0.75). Thus, even if the ICP price remained at 0.75 XDR for a whole year, the increase of the total supply due to the minting of node provider rewards would be only 4.51%.
* As mentioned above, @Kyle_Langham  started publishing a monthly report on [NNS and ICP Token metrics](https://medium.com/dfinity/nns-and-icp-token-metrics-monthly-report-oct-2022-fba10ce1ea63), which also includes node provider rewards. We can rely on this report for the monitoring of monthly ICP minting.

Thanks so much @bjoernek for providing this insight to the community! Looks like we can quash the rumors node rewards are an impeding disaster. Appreciate the transparency and data driven orientation. Though total supply would rise materially (In the WORST case), certainly doesn't seem at all like it would be devastating.

Thanks again!

Am I right that this calculation assumes the number of nodes stays constant? It is possible, though unlikely, that the price falls while the number of nodes keeps increasing. At what point will there be a moratorium on node onboarding if such a scene plays out?

1st of all it will fall.
2nd if kyle is afraid of death spiral now, it is a little bit late.
3rd I have proposed the creation of a reserve account of unallocated icp for circumstances like this one.
I was ignored cause they were focused on their treasury.
It surprises me that only noders are considered part of the ecosystem.
Well stakers are also important too.
So since the problem exists and no precautions are there, it is time dfinity to take the responsibility and back up the missing icp.
After that I hope they fix that weak point

Hello @Denis,

Thanks for astutely pointing this out!

Hello @bjoernek,

Given your analysis is calculated using a static rate of NP's, can the Foundation share NP onboarding plans into the Short/Mid term horizon? Specifically interested in the quantity of NP's the foundation plans to submit for onboarding on the NNS. 

Basic idea would be adding a dynamic parameter to your sheet that calculates NP rewards based on variable quantities of NP's.

Hello @blockpunk - Given the analysis provided herein, if you agree, would you be willing to consider changing the forum title to something more colorful lol? Overwhelming evidence (My personal opinion) there is no impeding death spiral even if token price dropped significantly lower. However, still think we as community have more information to vet. Perhaps, "Community Discussion: Assessing node inflation based on token price." Let the community know what you think :slight_smile:

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2022-11-23 03:28:07 UTC | #31

Why are node rewards simply not proportional to the amount of cycles burned?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-11-23 17:11:47 UTC | #32

That would tie node provider incentive to IC utilization, when they themselves don't necessarily use the IC itself. What the current model does is to incentivize regular and steady compute power at all times, independent of utilization or token price.

In an emergency situation, i.e. an inflationary downward spiral, I would temporarily halt

1. staking rewards
2. node provider Capex rewards (but not opex)

in that order.
Until the situation stabilises again, i.e. the price recovers.

We all would expect a recovery, wouldn't we?
As we all believe in IC tech and the value it creates for it users, aren't we?

dfisher | 2022-11-24 18:53:45 UTC | #36

I’m sorry but seed investors dumping is a way bigger issue than node providers . If folks think a tyranny of the majority is ok for the greater good best to start with them .

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-11-25 06:38:18 UTC | #37

Any response that involves losses to individuals or groups, or anything that could be construed as a broken promise is in my opinion a non-starter. There is an easy solution I have proposed that involves no loss to anybody and curbs inflation. 
But I realise from Dom's tweeting and his response on the ICA thread that there is no real acknowledgment of issues within Dfinity, no introspection and no desire to alter course based on past mistakes. Everything that has gone wrong is to be blamed solely on conspiracies and FUD.
I am now resigned to the idea that the IC will succeed or fail based solely on the tech, with no assistance from marketing, accessory specialisations or good governance involving transparent functioning by Dfinity. I have always believed in the technical prowess of Dfinity and hopefully that will suffice to bring in enough developers and great dapps to kickstart mass adoption.

Nice idea, I've changed it.

The response from the Foundation partially eliminated my innermost fears, but I still need to cut back on the increase as much as possible.

[quote="bjoernek, post:25, topic:16458"]
The proportion of monthly node provider rewards compared to total supply is 0.38% for the most extreme scenario 2 (ICP/XDR=0.75). Thus, even if the ICP price remained at 0.75 XDR for a whole year, the increase of the total supply due to the minting of node provider rewards would be only 4.51%.
[/quote]
If the ICP price drops another 75% (almost a dollar), the node's incremental issuance to the total supply comes to 4.51%, or an additional 22.2 million ICPs per year, which would be a huge expense to buy back all of them in the market.

So we need to be determined to deflate the inflation as much as possible and modify the parameters directly designed to the token economics, which is more complicated, so we need to be careful. Maybe I can use some financial instruments, some forward options under the DeFi mindset seems to solve some problems and avoid excessive growth of our total ICP. It is more complicated to directly modify the parameters design to the token economics, so we need to be careful.

If there are good ideas in the community, I hope you will suggest them.

The problem is why they think that only noders are part of IC

-------------------------

mystical | 2023-01-02 13:21:18 UTC | #41

Onboarding more nodes only when actual compute and storage demand (ICP burn rate in canisters) approaches the 80%-90% of utilization, of all available capacity, will be best, IMHO.  Because it'll halt infinite printing of ICP that gets simply sold on the market by node providers who have to pay real cash to datacenters for hosting.  

Someone has to pay for all these running servers, and if providers are given ICP, then all ICP holders together are paying for the hosting prices in the datacenters, even if they don't know it (price of their holdings goes down proportionally to how much $$$ was spent on running the servers). 

It's like the world had to pay for US stimulus checks and all the printed $. Someone had to lose purchasing power proportional to the amount of injected dollars to the circulation (and same with Euro unfortunately :sweat:). 

Growing number of nodes, without waiting for demand, means someone will need to pay the bills, but what are the options except devaluing the ICP asset proportionally? Who else has enough $ in reserves, to pay all the bills of all nodes, until demand for cycles catch up with provided capacity?

Really interesting question, I wonder what is the official plan by the foundation? To let the ICP market absorb all the hosting costs? what about nodes growth rate, it can really kill the project if ICP keeps trending toward pricing of 0.1$, which is inevitable with current model of minting the token for all running nodes, while not enough capacity is utilized (I guess if at least 50% will be utilized, it'll keep price stable, as someone picks up the tokens which node providers sell, correct?).

-------------------------

mystical | 2023-01-02 13:33:35 UTC | #42

fast growth of nodes that join the network will not be an issue in a large and functioning final version of the project where at least 1% of the internet as we know it, runs on IC. It'll have enough dApps which require compute power and burn cycles, to sponsor at least some number of always active nodes (and node providers will not be joining when rewards are getting lower than expected). 
Hmm, the stable rewards level for all nodes, seems like a weak point, it easily will burn through all market cap of ICP and we all end up simply paying hosting bills (by holding ICP). Doesn't seem like a good idea unless the foundation has enough cash reserves to keep the token alive for a year or two while dApp ecosystem accelerates (by sweeping the floor, buying all tokens that node providers definitely sell, because they have to pay bills, does Dfinity buy any ICP at the moment?).

But in current "incubation" stage, I don't see any way to fix it apart of centralized control of joining nodes, plus preferably a marketing effort to rehabilitate the brand in the eyes of broader community, which mostly thinks "it was a pump and dump scam" because there's not enough information about the technology reaching their Twitter feeds/etc'. I'd run some free bootcamp webinars for IC coding, onboarding more developers, and run ads on youtube (targeted at web3 dev topics) to bring people into the bootcamps. They all will start building stuff, some will also bring more capital into the ecosystem, probably.

-------------------------

what about a multiplier introduction, that rewards node providers with "base" pay that covers some of the expenses of running a server (it should really be at most equal to 100% of the monthly average hosting costs in the selected location. the server hardware should be investment by the operators, like in any other PoW, with the chances of having their rewards grow in value if the ecosystem usage grows) but anything beyond that only depends of how busy the global network was. Let's say utilization of all IC was 15% on average during the month, it means all node providers get ICP bonus of 15% on top of the base pay. But in this case, can node providers fake activity in the network by botting the dApps and burning cycles of the developers, in order to bump activity numbers?
If it can be faked, then it's bad idea. but if not, then it'll also make node operators try to promote the project on every corner, and shill it to developers of dApps, which is good :)
