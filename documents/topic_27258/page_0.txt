If I own some SNS tokens from a project, do I own also part of the project Intellectual Property (e.g. patents) developed in the context of a SNS project? How could project patents be under the control of the SNS DAO? More generally, how to make sure that any property, including IP, is under the control of the SNS DAO?
In summary, controlling the evolution of code is not enough because the project developers could just fork it and make sure that all relevant IP is under their control. What am I missing?

I think the DAO needs to "sign" some agreement to a legally registered entity to be able to really own anything.
