my project have multiple canister.
token canister: deal with balance, deposit and withdraw;
game canister: deal with the game logic and dependent to token canister.

and I want some of my function can only be called by game canister in order to prevent hijack.
since I can not import game canister in token canister , for it invoke cycling dependency.
I coding below:

```
let whiteList = Buffer.Buffer<Principal>(1);
whiteList.add(Principal.fromText("aovwi-4maaa-aaaaa-qaagq-cai")); 
 public shared (msg) func addBalance(user : Principal, amount : Nat) : async () {
        assert (Buffer.contains(whiteList, msg.caller, Principal.equal));
        book.addTokens(user, amount);
    };
    public shared (msg) func reduceBalance(user : Principal, amount : Nat) : async () {
        assert (Buffer.contains(whiteList, msg.caller, Principal.equal));
        switch (book.removeTokens(user, amount)) {
            case (null) {
                Debug.print("not enough ICP!");
            };
            case _ {};
        };
    };
```

aovwi-4maaa-aaaaa-qaagq-cai is game canister ID.
there is the error message:
```
Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed while trying to install all canisters.
    Failed to install wasm module to canister 'token'.
      Failed during wasm installation call: The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister aax3a-h4aaa-aaaaa-qaahq-cai trapped explicitly: RTS error: blob_of_principal: principal too short"
```
when I delete the code:
```
whiteList.add(Principal.fromText("aovwi-4maaa-aaaaa-qaagq-cai")); 
```
it works fine!
even I replace the aovwi-4maaa-aaaaa-qaagq-cai with 
```
whiteList.add(Principal.fromText("aaaaa-aa"));
```
it still has the same error message!
what should I do!
is there any thing functions as whitelist?

I played with a cut down version here and can't reproduce the error unless I call `Principal.fromText("") ` (passing an empty string).

Are you sure you aren't passing an empty string instead of a textual Principal somewhere?

thanks very!!!
I had Principal.fromText("") somewhere in my canister and now it works fine!
Loved you guys!
