Hey everyone, wanted to share that a new version of agent-js is out!

This includes an update to the default behavior of the authClient, so that it logs out and reloads the page by default. There's a flag to override that, and it also gets overridden if you pass an `onIdle` callback.

Additionally, there is a new [CanisterStatus](https://agent-js.icp.host/agent/modules/CanisterStatus.html) utility - if you pass it a canisterId and an Agent, it will check the status of your canister. You can query for the canister's controllers, candid interface, module hash, and more, getting back a friendly Map of the responses that are normally stored as buffers in a certificate tree.

Check out the release notes at https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/releases/tag/v0.11.2!
