Hi everyone,

It's finally time to vote for the [ICRC-1 Fungible Token Standard](https://github.com/dfinity/icrc-1). You can find the form [here](https://forms.gle/4cWhate991uYkv7q9). The rules for voting are described in [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icrc-1-token-standard-final-draft/14343). Voting will be available until tomorrow at 7pm CEST time.

Best,
Mario

Is there a reason this isn't a motion proposal on the NNS? (Just curious as this seems like a perfect fit for that.)

I second this, why are we voting on a google doc poll

The poll is the first step, if the poll gets enough votes there will be an NNS proposal.

As Zane mentioned, there'll be a proposal if it's voted in favor.

* If the working group decides in favor of this standard, DFINITY will submit it as an NNS motion proposal, such that the community can decide whether or not they would like to make this a standard. DFINITY will voluntarily abstain from voting on the NNS proposal.
