I have a wallet feature in the dapp I’ve created. I’d like to be able to allow users to be able to stake from their wallets. I’m currently unaware of any products other than the NNS frontend that allows users to stake neurons on the IC. Does anyone know if it’s possible to create such a stealing feature? If so, could you provide some resources that may be useful?

[This library](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js) contains a lot of helpers for interacting with the IC (including Neuron management) from the frontend. You can also check our the [NNS dApps source code](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp) for inspiration.
