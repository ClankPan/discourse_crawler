Can blockchains take on AWS?

The Internet Computer might be the first blockchain that can.

This episode discusses each of their pros and cons, and how an early-stage DFINITY vs. AWS battle would play out.

At the 21:40 mark they mention data transmission fees as an extra cost at AWS. Does that mean that we won't pay that when using the ICP? Or does data transmission in this context not mean outbound data like in AWS? Just trying to get a better understanding of the costs, since 5 dollars per GB per year seems a little high compared to AWS or Azure storage costs.
