As the demand for real-time data processing continues to grow, the integration of edge computing with the Internet Computer framework presents a promising solution. Edge computing, which involves processing data closer to the source, can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage, thereby enhancing the efficiency of data processing.

Combining the decentralized nature of the Internet Computer with edge computing allows for a more resilient and scalable infrastructure. By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, we can create a robust system that supports efficient data management and processing at the edge of the network.

In this thread, let's discuss the best practices, tools, and strategies for integrating **[edge computing](https://www.lenovo.com/ch/fr/servers-storage/solutions/edge-computing/)** with the Internet Computer. Share your experiences, insights, and any challenges you have encountered. Together, we can explore how to maximize the potential of this integration to improve overall system performance and achieve greater data processing efficiency.

Looking forward to your contributions and insights!
