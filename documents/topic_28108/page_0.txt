Hello everyone, I am looking for an advanced Rust developer who knows the IC and has done at least some programming with it already.

We won a DFINITY Grant late last year, and are developing an App for Notes using the IC Blockchain. More details here: https://satoshinotes.org/

If you are interested please DM me, we have funds allocated, and want to finish this app. The app is partially built, we now need a good amount of Rust code to finish, and a competent developer to do the job.

Exciting that you are expanding your team!

I see that you already posted on the jobs-hiring channel on the ICP Developer Communtiy Discord. 

I suggest that you also post the opportunity on the [Internet Computer Jobs Board](https://careers.internetcomputer.org/jobs).
