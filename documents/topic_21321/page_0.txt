Hello everyone, 

I have issues using the latest version of dfx 0.14.2. I'm simply starting a hello world project with the following steps:
```
dfx new --type=rust hello
cd hello
dfx start --background
```
This leads to the following error (not only in hello project, but also in other, existing projects):
```
thread 'canister-http-adapter-actor' panicked at 'Could not start canister http adapter.: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }', src/dfx/src/actors/canister_http_adapter.rs:196:41
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

Same steps with dfx 0.13.1 works like a charm...

Any ideas?

Add `--clean` flag might fix the issue,
```
dfx start --clean --background
```

What do you see?
```
$ dfx --version
dfx 0.14.2
$ dfx cache show
/Users/ericswanson/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.14.2
$ ls -1 $(dfx cache show)
base
canister_sandbox
dfx
ic-admin
ic-btc-adapter
ic-https-outcalls-adapter
ic-nns-init
ic-ref
ic-starter
icx-proxy
libs

mo-ide

sns
```

dfx installs its cache by creating a temp directory and then renaming it, in order to avoid a partially-populated cache directory, but if somehow your cache directory does not contain all of the above files, you could run `dfx cache delete` and then try again.

`ls -1 $(dfx cache show)`

Thanks, deleting the cache did was the trick! Before running this command I only had `extension` in the cache folder, after that it looks like in your comment and everything runs smooth again...
