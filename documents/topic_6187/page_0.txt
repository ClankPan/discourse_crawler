Is it possible to provide the `main` field of a canister in `dfx.json` with a directory up path?

Such as for example:

```
{
  "canisters": {
    "yolo": {
      "main": "../backend/yolo.mo", // <- here ../
      "type": "motoko"
    },
```

We've got a mono-repo (with no scripts at its root). I was asking myself if it would be possible move the backend code "outside" of the (frontend) app. 

Might be useful if same canisters would be used across projects of the mono-repo.

```
./
./app1/package.json
./app1/dfx.json
./app2/package.json
./app2/dfx.json
./backend/yolo
```

To answer my own question, **no** parent path are not supported.

If I  use as displayed above `"../backend/yolo.mo"` or absolute path in my `dfx.json` configuration, I get errors such as:

> The post-build step failed for canister '...' with an embedded error: Directory at '...' is outside the workspace root.

That being said, there might be anyway a solution for my use case with a monorepo by moving the `dfx.json` configuration to the parent or top folder. Doing so I can have the frontend app(s) in different folders and the canisters separated.

```
./app/package.json
./app/src/index.html

./backend/src/counter.mo

./dfx.json
```

It needs some modifications in `dfx.json` and in the `webpack.config` but, that seems duable.

I've put together a [sample / starter](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/dfx-root-config) repo, seems alright at least when run on a a local ic.
