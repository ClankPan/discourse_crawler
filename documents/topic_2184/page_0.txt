I'm struggling to figure out how to pass around a canister actor method reference in Rust like [we can with Motoko](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/sharing.html#_publisher_subscriber_pattern_with_actors). 

I was pointed towards the [Candid type reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/candid-guide/candid-types.html#type-func) which showed I should be using the `IDLValue`, but the type isn't implemented and can't be serialized on its own. 

I feel like I'm missing something small.

Can anyone get me back on track?

I got this to work with `candid::Func`

```rust
use ic_cdk::export::candid::Func;

let fn = Func {
    principal: Principal::from_text("r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai").unwrap(),
    method: String::from("funcname"),
}
```

How do I get the canister's own principal?
