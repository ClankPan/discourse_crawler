Is it possible with quill or dfx? The closest I've gotten is using dfx:

> dfx canister --network https://ic0.app call --query rrkah-xxxxx-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai get_neuron_ids

But it just returns a list of every neuron's ID in an apparently random order. And the closest I've gotten with quill is:

> quill-linux-x86 --pem-file /home/xyx/identity-0.pem list-neurons

Which seems to return JSON data? I'm not sure what to do with that.

I can see the neuron's listed in the NNS but it's not what I'm after. Any help is appreciated.
