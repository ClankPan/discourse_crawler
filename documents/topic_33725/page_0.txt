So I just realized that the icx that I purchased last year has been taken off of my nnns, And it appears that they even removed it from icp coins. So in other words, my crypto was just stolen from me off of my nns And it looks like it was actually done by internet computer. Does somebody wanna explain to me what the f*** How can crypto we've purchased?Just be taken away from us????

Note that **`ICX` has been renamed** (back) to **`SEER`**, so it's possible that the **tokens are still there** but now under **[Seers](https://nns.ic0.app/project/?project=u67kc-jyaaa-aaaaq-aabpq-cai) project and with name `SEER`**.
