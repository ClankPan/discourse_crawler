Great use case! I am looking for years for a decentralized, easy to use and secure file sharing and signature solution. 
Key in my opinion (as seems to be baked into the Docutrack approach) – an easy way to exchange files and make use of the service with non-web3 users, non-IID users. 
After a simple first test with 3 files:
-	A file uploaded by the counter party after sending a file request does not show in my dashboard when I open the file request. 
-	There should be a way to entice users to sign up for an IID that goes with the initial file request. 
-	The “share” function opens the list of existing alpha users who have an IID. I suppose here the experience should be a little bit more dropbox et al like and give 2-3 sharing options (email, IID, link). 
-	Last one - the recipient of a file request who complied with it doesn't seem to have a way to now track the file (if they do not have a IID). 

That's for now. Great work guys!

The same II number cannot be accessed on different devices, only the device where it was uploaded can be accessed; after clearing the browser cache, it will no longer be accessible.

I think the known issues must be solved first, otherwise it is not really useable in real world. See the disclaimer.

What features do you find most useful, and what additional functionalities would you like to see in future updates?
[/quote]

* File management tools ? delete, hide, filter, shared/unshared, file grouping, etc.
* Feature to preview the Content of file (pdf previewer)
* Malicious file scanner ? (warn/prevent user from downloading malicious shared file)
* Compatibility with all dApps in ICP ecosystem.
* Can it be as a file storage / vault ? more than just Document sharing purpose ?

Here is another idea: If DocuTrack could allow for securely sharing passwords/ access. I.e., I want to give access to a password protected website to someone, but they need to request it via the link the included in the less secure communication (i.e. via email). In this feature DocuTrack asks for the URL, user name and pw and then creates the secure sharing link or request/ reveal link.

Is there any development update on DocuTrack? I believe that we need this kind of product to promote real use cases of ICP for productivity outside of crypto-related use cases as soon as possible.

Hi Ajismyd

Unfortunately, there is currently no on-going project to turn this example into a full-blown product. If you (or someone you know) is interested in working on this, I am happy to help getting started.

That’s kind of disappointing to be honest. I understand you guys are busy and this is a proof-of-concept (although I could’ve sworn I saw reports of this being used by some institution) but like an earlier reply states I think that a dApp like this is critical for expanding the IC beyond just defi and helping it to compete with traditional web as it stands.

Does ic-oss meet your cases? Although it's still in development, I can speed up the progress.

Thank you @yvonneanne for taking your time to reply. 

Hearing the news that this project is no longer being developed is really sad to hear in my opinion. I find the sovereign personal storage feature very interesting and believe it could create a significant network effect on demand for ICP. Imagine if the majority of users started spinning their own canisters to store and share data. The consumption of cycles would increase drastically.

I find it a bit odd to market a cloud service product without even has the most basic and simple storage product.

Unfortunately, I'm not a developer, but I'm very interested in using and waiting for this feature if it becomes available in the future. I hope DFINITY is willing to re-consider continuing this product to a full-blown stage. If necessary, could seek assistance from the ICP developer community or acquire storage projects that are being developed by ICP developers and integrate them into the core features of ICP.

ajismyid | 2024-06-27 03:14:31 UTC | #12

Yes, it might meet my needs. I want to see a storage canister like DocuTrack, but with more complete features.

This need to be built by independent projects. Dfinity needs to focus on protocol level stuff.
