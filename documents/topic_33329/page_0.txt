Good day, ICP community! We're excited to share our progress and insights into Panorama Block's development journey. We've been deeply immersed in our development efforts and recently, we've made significant strides towards realizing our vision.

**Project Highlights**
Panorama Block aims to become the trusted "source of truth" across various L1/L2 ecosystems by offering comprehensive, well-organized, and indexed on-chain data sets. The project offers unique value through decentralized access to on-chain data on ICP, featuring cross-chain data analytics enhanced with AI for deep insights and predictive
analytics.

**Web3 Advantages**
Panorama Block offers unique value through decentralized access to on-chain data on the Internet Computer. Key features include cross-chain data analytics with an overlay of AI, providing deep insights and predictive analytics across multiple blockchains. We provide a more resilient and censorship-resistant solution compared to competitors who use centralized servers, enhancing data integrity and security by storing and processing data directly on the ICP, thereby avoiding potential tampering and data breaches associated with centralized systems. Unlike competitors, we stand out by using a decentralized infrastructure, offering AI-powered cross-chain analytics, maintaining true on-chain data integrity, and eliminating dependence on centralized services.

**How is it Build** / **ICP Superpowers**
We leverage a refactored backend from Motoko to the ICP's TypeScript Azle CDK and a queue algorithm for real-time capture of on-chain Bitcoin network data. From this, details such as block size, value, and transaction count are rendered on our frontend using React and TypeScript. Specific transaction information and addresses are also displayed to users in pop-ups, reinforcing the application's role as a secure information source. We've implemented a new "whales hunting" tab to store addresses and information about crypto market whales. Additionally, to aid user analysis, we provide a network information section with graphical representations. Key components include:
1-Motoko for smart contract development, Rust for system programming.
2-Canister SDK for IC-specific development, TypeScript for frontend development.
3-OpenChat library integrated for community engagement, OpenAI library for AI-driven insights.

**Go-To-Market Strategy**
1-Developer Engagement: Hosting developer workshops, contributing to open-source projects, and providing comprehensive documentation and tutorials on integrating with Panorama Block's APIs.
2-Institutional Partnerships:Collaborating with financial institutions and blockchain projects to integrate Panorama Block's analytics tools for market analysis, risk management, and investment strategies.
3-Community Building:Establishing online forums, participating in blockchain conferences, and leveraging social media to foster community engagement and gather feedback.

**Monetization**
Revenue streams for Panorama Block include:
1-Subscription Tiers:Offering different subscription tiers (e.g., Community, Entrepreneur, Enterprise) with access to advanced data analytics tools, customizable dashboards, and premium datasets.
2-Consultancy Services:Providing specialized consultancy services for integrating Panorama Block's APIs and analytics tools into custom applications and workflows.
3-Marketplace:Hosting a marketplace for developers to sell AI models, data services, and analytics solutions, generating revenue through transaction fees and premium listings.

**Status of the Project**
Currently, Panorama Block is in the development phase, focusing on:
1-Finalizing the MVP with integrated AI-driven analytics and decentralized data access.
2-Conducting beta testing with select developer and institutional partners to validate platform functionality and performance.
3-Expanding data coverage and refining AI/ML models based on user feedback and market demands.

**Future Plans**
In addition to developing our proprietary scorecard product, Pano Ranking, our future plans include expanding our capabilities and offerings. Please check our whitepaper (https://docs.panoramablock.com/roadmap/development-timeline) to read more about our forward-moving plans.
