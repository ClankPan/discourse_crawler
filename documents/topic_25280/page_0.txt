It seems ic_stable_structures `BTreeMap` and `Vec` do not implement the `DoubleEndedIterator` trait for their Iterators. 

How do we `.iter().rev()` on these structures? 
(Iterate by shared reference in reverse order)

Hi @Samer, a `DoubleEndedIterator` has already been implemented for `Vec` in [this PR](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/156) but it hasn't been released yet. I believe @hpeebles is planning on writing a `DoubleEndedIterator` for `BTreeMap` as well, and without that, iterating in reverse order in `BTreeMap` is not yet possible unfortunately.

I created [an issue](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/issues/157) to track this.

I would love to implement it for `BTreeMap` if I get time, but realistically its unlikely I'll do it any time soon since it isn't a high priority for me compared to some of the OpenChat stuff we have lined up.

The workaround is obvious for now.

We convert (parts of) the stable structure into a heap structure and reverse iterate on that. This works for small data sets for now

Looking forward to the impl!
