Hello all,

We're excited to share the sixth topic in our [open-source educational series](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education) about developing on the IC. As we've previously shared, **DFINITY Education** is an effort to help students get up-to-speed with IC development through the lens of traditional computer science concepts. These repos include several modules and are meant to serve as the backbone for educators looking to build out their own computer science coursework offerings.

[This month's content](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency) is centered around **Blockchain and Cryptocurrency**, where we provide sample activities that culminate in the creation of a **payment channel** using an ERC-20 style token.

In this course, students will learn about the fundamentals of blockchain technology as well as the cryptocurrencies built on top of it. Module 1 serves as an intro to the concept of blockchains, cryptocurrencies, limitations of these services, and payment channels. Module 2 explains tokens and gives students the opportunity to experiment with an ERC-20 style token built on Motoko. In Module 3 students begin their own implementation of a payment channel in Motoko, and in Module 4 they finish this implementation. Each module builds upon concepts learned and activities completed in the prior modules.

Please take a look through these modules, and feel free to message me or @roast_beef with any questions or suggestions you have. We're looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
