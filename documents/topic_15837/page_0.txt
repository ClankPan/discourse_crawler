Hello everyone,

I'm trying to setup a test subnet in order to modify the IC consensus algorithm and do some benchmarking. I would like to make sure that my test subnet is as similar as possible to a real subnet running on the IC while ignoring all the XNet communication and using a simple P2P layer which broadcasts artifacts directly to the peers without using adverts.

I'm creating my own simple P2P layer and interfacing it with the original consensus layer via the Artifact Manager. Has anybody tried to do something similar or knows a better approach?

It would be great to have a test subnet that everybody can use to conduct their own experiments so if you think the same let me know :)

tagging @diegop because he probably knows who to ping internally that might provide some guidance
