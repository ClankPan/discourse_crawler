Hello, I am aware of this article : https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/functionality/ledger/deploy-new-token/

I need to know, if there is any way we can create test tokens like we do in Eth or Bsc. I want to create some kind of Voucher Tokens, which later on will get replaced by real tokens.
I know that there is a Token Registry section in Stoic Wallet, which lets you create your own token and transfer to others, But I guess we cant use those tokens outside stoic wallet , like Plug? 
Also, If I want to use Stoic Wallet custom Tokens, is there any API which I can use for Transfers like Rosetta , just for Stoic Test Tokens?
