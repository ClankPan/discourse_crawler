How my developer identity gets some ICPs from my NNS identity to deploy some canister with the dfx command?

Thanks for any hint.

Hey there :slight_smile: 

I've just went through that process and would like to help out with this.

The process you want to follow is the one explained in the ICP documentation on this page https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html

if you do the command:
`dfx ledger account-id`

You will get the actual address to which to send the ICP from your NNS identity wallet. After you've sent it to that address, check your ICP balance in your local dev wallet account with

`dfx ledger --network ic balance` This will show how much ICP you have with your local dev account on ICP mainnet.

For the whole process on how to then convert ICP from your local dev wallet account into cycles on mainnet, then use that wallet to deploy an app to mainnet, read the whole article I've linked above with understanding.
