Check this out https://github.com/gabrielnic/dfinity-react

It does have a small backend canister but you can remove it from dfx.json

There are two approaches to integrating a react app into a dfx project. 

1.  port an exisiting or a new empty react project created using `create react app`

2. convert the dfx generated web assets into a react webapp.

I have documented the steps in the README.md for the projects. one can also use the above projects as starting templates.
