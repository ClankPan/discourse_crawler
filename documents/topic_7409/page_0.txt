Can we use commands to manage neurons?

I want to do the following from command line:
- Stake a new neuron
- Set its dissolve delay (in a high-precision fashion, rather than using mouse cursor)
- Merge maturity (with option to choose 0-100%)
- Query neuron's maturity yield 

Can't find any command to achieve these goals from `dfx canister` or `dfx ledger`.

You can, you do this by calling the NNS governance canister using dfx. For an airgapped setup youâ€™d sign a message instead of calling directly, eg:

`dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet sign rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai get_full_neuron '(<your_neuron_id> : nat64 )'`

See this guide for more on this:
[https://ic.associates/nns-command-line-guide/](https://ic.associates/nns-command-line-guide/)

You can also use the **quill** tool, which has built in commands for tasks like this:

Yes, would like to know how to merge maturity as well, ic.associates is cool but no command to merge maturity. is there a command to merge maturity on the command line?

I found it to Merge the Maturity, if it helps anyone:

```
dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call \
    rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron \
    '(
        record { 
            id = opt record {id ='neuron--id-goes-here' : nat64}; 
            command = opt variant { 
                MergeMaturity = record { 
                    percentage_to_merge = 100 : nat32;
                }
            }
        }
    )'
```
