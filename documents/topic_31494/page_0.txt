*Decentralized Security:* 
Unlike Web2 applications that rely on centralized servers vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, your password manager running on the Internet Computer blockchain leverages decentralization for enhanced security. User data is stored across multiple nodes in a tamper-proof manner, reducing the risk of single points of failure and unauthorized access.

*Immutable Data:* 
Web3 applications like yours benefit from the immutability of blockchain technology. Once user data is stored on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or tampered with, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information such as passwords and user credentials.

*User Privacy:* 
With Web2 applications, users often have to trust third-party service providers with their personal data, leading to privacy concerns. However, your password manager on the Internet Computer blockchain prioritizes user privacy by allowing users to maintain full control over their data. User passwords and credentials are encrypted and securely managed on the blockchain, eliminating the need to rely on centralized entities.

*Censorship Resistance:* 
Web3 applications are inherently resistant to censorship due to their decentralized nature. Your password manager app running on the Internet Computer blockchain ensures that users can access and manage their passwords without fear of censorship or interference from centralized authorities or intermediaries.

*Transparent Governance:* 
Unlike traditional Web2 applications where governance decisions are made by centralized entities, Web3 applications leverage decentralized governance mechanisms. Your password manager app can incorporate governance features powered by smart contracts, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes and ensuring transparency and fairness in the platform's evolution.

*Interoperability:*
Web3 applications have the advantage of interoperability, enabling seamless integration with other decentralized applications and services. Your password manager app can leverage interoperability to provide users with a unified and comprehensive solution for managing their digital identities and passwords across various platforms and ecosystems.

**Rust Backend Code**

*Language Choice:* 
The backend of your password manager app is built using the Rust programming language. Rust is chosen for its performance, reliability, and strong memory safety guarantees, making it well-suited for building secure and efficient applications.

*Security Features:* 
Rust's language features, such as its ownership model and memory safety, contribute to the overall security of the backend code. Rust's compiler detects and prevents common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences, ensuring robust security for your password manager.

*Functionality:* 
The Rust backend handles core functionalities of the password manager app, including user authentication, password encryption, storage management, and interaction with the Internet Computer blockchain through canisters.

**Canister Deployment on Blockchain**

*Decentralized Infrastructure:* 
The backend code is deployed onto the Internet Computer blockchain as a canister, which serves as a secure and decentralized execution environment for the app.

*Smart Contract Functionality:* 
Canisters on the Internet Computer blockchain act as smart contracts, governing the behavior and interactions of the password manager app. They enforce rules for accessing and modifying user data, ensuring security and transparency.

*Blockchain Integration:* 
By deploying the backend code onto the blockchain, your password manager app leverages the blockchain's inherent properties, such as immutability, decentralization, and censorship resistance, to enhance security and reliability.

**Frontend UX/UI Design in Figma**

*Design Process:* 
The frontend user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of your password manager app are designed using Figma, a collaborative design tool. Figma allows designers to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

*Visual Consistency:* 
Figma enables designers to maintain visual consistency across different screens and components of the password manager app, ensuring a cohesive and polished user experience.

*Prototyping:* 
Figma facilitates rapid prototyping and iteration, allowing designers to quickly create interactive prototypes of the password manager app and gather feedback from stakeholders.

*Create Compelling Content:*
Develop engaging content that resonates with your target audience's interests and pain points related to password management and cybersecurity in the Web3 ecosystem. This could include blog posts, tutorials, case studies, and infographics.

*Utilize Social Media Channels:*
Leverage popular social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, and specialized Web3 communities to share your content and engage with your audience. Participate in relevant discussions, answer questions, and showcase the value of your password manager app.

*Engage with Influencers:*
Identify influential figures and thought leaders within the Web3 space, such as blockchain developers, cybersecurity experts, and tech enthusiasts. Build relationships with them and explore opportunities for collaboration, such as guest blogging, podcast interviews, or joint webinars to amplify your reach.

*Host Webinars and Workshops:*
Organize online webinars and workshops to educate your audience about password management best practices, cybersecurity trends, and the benefits of using your password manager app in the Web3 environment. Offer valuable insights and practical tips to establish credibility and attract new users.

*Offer Exclusive Promotions:*
Run limited-time promotions or offer exclusive discounts to incentivize users to try out your password manager app. Highlight the unique features and benefits of your app and emphasize the value proposition for Web3 users.

*Build a Community:*
Create an online community around your password manager app where users can connect, share feedback, and support each other. Foster a sense of belonging and loyalty by actively engaging with community members and addressing their needs and concerns.

**Monetization Strategy with ICP Token**

*Freemium Model:*
Your password manager app will be available for free to all users, offering essential features such as password storage, encryption, and basic security monitoring. This allows users to get started with the app and experience its benefits without any upfront cost.

*Subscription Options with ICP Token:*

Thanks for sharing your project! This is a very interesting one.

Since VetKeys is not available as a system API yet, you are using a testing implementation that uses an insecure key, but this is not mentioned anywhere in your post or the website. It should be made very obvious to anyone that uses your app that the encryption is _not_ secure and when there is a release of VetKeys you will need to create fresh accounts (or migrate unsecured data to a secure encryption, but that doesn't make much sense).

The marketing page looks nice, but how come you did not host it on the Internet Computer? What issues did you run into there?

Do you have any plans to use a custom domain for the primary UI as well?
