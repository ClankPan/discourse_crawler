You can't 'transfer form icrc1 to icrc2'. icrc1 and icrc2 are two ways of interacting with the same balances. You can read the standards [right here](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md)

Its works now. After reviewing the code https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/main/ref/ICRC1.mo found that  creating agent from actor and changed to plug-wallet and it works like charm. :grinning:
