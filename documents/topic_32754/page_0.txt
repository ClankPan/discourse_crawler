## **Project Highlights**

The idempotent-proxy is a reverse proxy service written in Rust with built-in idempotency support. This project addresses the need for consistent and reliable request handling by caching responses to repeated requests with the same idempotency key. The target users are developers and enterprises who require dependable HTTP request handling and integration with Web2 services, specifically through HTTPS outcalls for ICP canisters.

## **Web3 Advantages**

While there are numerous reverse proxy services in the Web2 world, the idempotent-proxy differentiates itself by integrating seamlessly with Web3 technologies, particularly the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Unlike traditional Web2 proxies, idempotent-proxy supports idempotent operations, ensuring consistent responses to repeated requests, which is crucial for blockchain applications where determinism and consistency are paramount.

## **How It Is Built**

The project is built using Rust and Cloudflare Worker. It leverages open-source libraries and integrates Redis (or DurableObject in Cloudflare Worker) for caching responses. The architecture includes:
- A reverse proxy server to handle incoming requests
- Caching responses in Redis to ensure idempotency
- Filtering responses and headers to return only necessary data
- Implementing access control using Secp256k1 and Ed25519 for secure operations

## **Internet Computer Superpowers**

The Internet Computerâ€™s advanced features like HTTPS outcalls and robust canister support are crucial for this project. The ability to proxy HTTPS requests directly from ICP canisters enables seamless integration with Web2 services, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of decentralized applications.

## **Go-To-Market Strategy**

To attract users, the project will focus on:
- Engaging with the ICP developer community through forums and social media
- Collaborating with DFINITY and other Web3 projects to demonstrate use cases
- Offering comprehensive documentation and support to facilitate adoption

## **Monetization**

The project is open-source and aims to generate revenue through support services, custom implementations, and possibly premium features in the future.

## **Status of the Project**

The project has successfully implemented the core features, including idempotent request handling, response filtering, and access control. It has received a $5k Developer Grant from the DFINITY Foundation, highlighting its potential and value. The proxy service is fully functional, and integration with ICP canisters has been demonstrated.
