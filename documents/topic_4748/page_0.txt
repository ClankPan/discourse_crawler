are canister identities the same as the person that uses them ? the canisters basically become a conglomerate of tokens or cycles with a personality and opinions that influence other canisters and actual people. 
The canister is essentially a tokenized person with the ICP as DNA and the cycles as the air or breaths and energy it utilizes .  
I am imagining the incredible implications of this and the ways in which the power of this can be harvested in my projects .
