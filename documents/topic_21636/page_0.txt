I don't want to provide cycles for the user's calls,
Is there a way for the user to ask him to carry the required cycles when requesting the method in the canister?
Similar to the gas payment logic of the Ethereum chain

You can only request cycles from calls by other canisters, not from ingress messages. Hence, this would only be possible using canister-based wallets.
