Hi there, 

I saw the slide below from a technical overview on IC (https://medium.com/dfinity/a-technical-overview-of-the-internet-computer-f57c62abc20f). It shows the failure probability of liveness, corruption and repairability of various subnets. 

Can you let me know how are they derived? Is there any paper or article giving the mathematical model behind this?
