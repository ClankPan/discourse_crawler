I think at this point we should guard the ICP price and keep it tied to the FIL, rather than let this incident continue to expand and the community still does nothing! There must be someone in the community who can easily control the price!

No one can control the price, but I believe ICPers are buying and devs are building. 
It is such a good time to accumulate ICP. 
Just be easy.

Absolutely someone can, and they don't do it now, because every time BTC rallies it also rallies, and there has been no rally since this news came out, it now needs them to continue to bundle with the FIL price
