Hey folks, in dire need of some help. For the life of me, I can't seem to find my SNS1 > ICP trades that I performed on ICLighthouse. I even checked https://ic.house/swaps but nothing appears when I enter the canister and my principal ID. If anyone can find these trades, I'll happily reward them in ICP. (I have the transfers, but I can't link up the amount of ICP that was traded for SNS1 (DKP) so they're not really helpful) 

Principal: fuptq-7hacq-43rnq-odeus-neihg-nnkiq-rhde3-tkztw-olrta-dhowr-wae
Transfers can be seen here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/zxeu2-7aaaa-aaaaq-aaafa-cai/account/fuptq-7hacq-43rnq-odeus-neihg-nnkiq-rhde3-tkztw-olrta-dhowr-wae

Please help, otherwise I'm F'd for taxes if I don't know how much I purchased these for.
