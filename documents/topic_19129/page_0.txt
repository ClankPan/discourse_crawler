Is there an argument to skip build when deploying with dfx?

e.g. if I already built my frontend dapp in my pipeline or if I build my backend canister with a custom script, I would be interested to skip building when running `dfx deploy`

If you have a `wasm` module ready, you can just use `dfx install --mode upgrade --wasm <wasm>`.

Works with gzipped wasm too? That would solve backend, cool.

For frontend that uses the certified asset canister, question remains open.

I think so, yes.

Maybe @severin can answer that?

It should work for the frontend too. Otherwise it's a bug. You can just `dfx canister install --mode upgrade` and it will see that the wasm is unchanged, and still do the upload.

Example:
```
‚ùØ dfx canister install --mode upgrade hello_frontend
Module hash 98863747bb8b1366ae5e3c5721bfe08ce6b7480fe4c3864d4fec3d9827255480 is already installed.

Cool, will try. Thanks for the answers.
