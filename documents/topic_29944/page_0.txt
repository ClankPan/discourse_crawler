Hey guys, 

How do I find the dissolve date for neurons that are dissolving? My objective is to calculate the dissolve delay bonus for neurons. For neurons that are not dissolving it is fairly simple as the get_neuron endpoint tells me the DissolveDelaySeconds.

However, for a neuron that is dissolving, the endpoints only displays WhenDissolvedTimestampSeconds, how do I find the dissolve delay using that to calculate the dissolve delay bonus for that neuorn?

`WhenDissolvedTimestampSeconds` gives you the timestamp when the neuron is dissolved. So you need the current time to calculate the dissolve delay. 
The dissolve delay is then `WhenDissolvedTimestampSeconds - currentTime()`.

Oh, I misunderstood it as the timestamp from which it started dissolving. Got it!
