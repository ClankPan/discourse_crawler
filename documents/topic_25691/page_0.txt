Some `dfx start --clean` accross dfx upgrades has freaking wiped out one of my main identity. How do I retrieve it?

Hardware backup for the win but gosh, even if I've got other controllers assigned to my canisters, still absolutely hated it!

I wonder which files dfx opens and reads/writes to. Long ago I was trying to launch multiple dfx commands asynchronously and things were crashing because of that. Perhaps the new dfx tried to change your pem file while multiple processes were using it

Just discovered that there is a good chance that the PEM files were actually deleted by NNS dapp tooling rather than dfx. One or the other. I guess I should probably start being more strict and work with more profiles and sandboxes.
