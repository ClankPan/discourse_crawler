C wrapper for the IC rust Agent. 

This project focuses on the gaming community, enabling developers to smoothly integrate their C++ native projects with the IC interface on-chain, using our wrapper for seamless interaction. Easy deployment becomes a reality for any C++ projects on IC, welcoming game developers, particularly those using Unreal Engine. Our mission is to bridge the gap, enhancing IC's accessibility and inviting a broader community of creators. Through our innovative solution, game developers can fully unlock IC's potential, fostering collaboration and creativity. Repository: [https://github.com/Zondax/icp-client-cpp]
