Getting Gateway error while trying to upgrade the canisters today in Network.

Is it happening only to my canisters ?

Anyone else feeling the heat ?

I had a Gateway error while deploying at around 11am (GMT+2) too. Afterwards using the identity was also a bit slow. I went for lunch and it seemed alright afterwards.
