Happy Friday ICPeople! [Proposal 131754 ](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131754)to upgrade the NNS dapp just went live, please consider voting. :ballot_box:

This proposal includes a fix for incorrect TX fees reported by @Dogmi [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dogmi-sns-transfer-wrong-transfer-fee/34114) as well as further progress on the neurons table.

Wasm sha256 hash: `34da546742bb238680b744ff7fa45f7beb616ab73cadc9211b855feb82402555` (`https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/actions/runs/10384322394`)

## Change Log

### Added

* Parse and trim proposal payload for `InstallCode` within the `get_proposal_payload` back-end endpoint.
* Support rendering `InstallCode` proposal payload by calling `get_proposal_payload`.

### Changed

* Round neuron stake and maturity to 2 decimals in tables.
* Show detailed stake amount in neuron details page.

### Fixed

* Fixed incorrect interpretation of ICRC fees (#5314).

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the [nns-dapp repo](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp):

```
git fetch  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout "f815af3e17afcb4a9251b68b79ba6f950194c8f5"
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main && echo "OK" || echo "Commit is not on main branch!"
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm.gz
```

You may also want to verify the canister arguments. In the proposal they are binary, which is not very readable. Docker provides both binary and text formats and you can verify that the text format corresponds to the binary `arg_hex` field in the proposal.

```
cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did
didc encode "$(cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did)"
```
