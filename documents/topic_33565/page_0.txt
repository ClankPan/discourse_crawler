I currently manage a number of websites that runs on WordPress, hosted on a Linux server that I have built using a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). While I'm in IT, my development experience is limited. I'm curious if it's possible to set up a similar LAMP stack on the IC, allowing me to spin up a WordPress instance for each website. Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated. I'm considering moving all my WordPress sites to the IC for its security and decentralization benefits, as long as the running costs are comparable to what I'm paying now.

Still the same situation as discussed a while ago:
