Hi!
I'm trying to setup a simple call to https://identity.ic0.app. 
Building the default plain vanilla Angular app with @dfinity/agent fails (app doesn't compile successfully). App contents:
*import {AuthClient} from '@dfinity/auth-client';*
*async init() {*
*    this.authClient = await AuthClient.create();*
*}*

**Compilation error is:**
Error: Optimization error [main.js]: Error: Transform failed with 1 error:
main.js:93948:5: error: Expected identifier but found "="
at failureErrorWithLog (.../node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1449:15)

at Pipe.onStreamRead (internal/stream_base_commons.js:186:23)

I got past a bunch of errors related to BigInt, installing missing dependencies etc but got stuck on this. 
Any ideas?? Thanks.

Never used the auth with Angular but, as I noticed `esbuild` in your stacktrace wanted to ask if you tried with Angular v12.1 and if you had the problem too?

I think they switched in v12.2 to esbuild for the CLI. Maybe it works with previous version?

Not a solution, just maybe a workaround.

Good idea bro.
I downgraded to Angular 11.2 and that particular error went away. I ran into some new problems, but I've been able to resolve those. 
Thanks!
