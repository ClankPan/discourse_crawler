How can I encode fixed-size naturals (like `Nat16`) to use them as arguments of `dfx canister call` instructions?

Thanks

If you are calling a canister in your dfx.json, you can just use the number, dfx will know its expected type. If it's a remote canister, you can use type annotations, for example, `(42 : nat16)`
