Why not reach out to the maker of glaze? Pretty sure they have a functioning version of what you want

Ok so instead of remaking something that exists and asking for money to do so... Why not utilize what is already made and maybe try to improve on it?

I want to make it different, and compete, the more apps, or daps it will be good for the ecosystem
