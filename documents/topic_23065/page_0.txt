**Authors:** @bjoern @bjoernek 

### Problem statement

* Node provider rewards are issued monthly in ICP, calculated by applying a 30-day average ICP/XDR rate to a fixed XDR amount which is dependent on the node hardware and its country.
* Hence, when the ICP/XDR rate decreases, more ICP is minted for these rewards.
* This creates a potential risk of an inflationary spiral. This spiral could occur as follows: a decline in ICP price leads to higher node rewards in ICP, which are then sold, causing a further ICP price decline.
* Given ongoing community discussions about this issue, we aim to share our analysis and suggestions for next steps.

### Analysis Node provider rewards vs Voting rewards

* At current price levels, Node provider rewards make up only 16% of total rewards, compared to Voting rewards.
  * If the ICP price drops by 50%, this proportion increases to 27%.
  * If the ICP price drops by 75%, this proportion increases to 43%.
* Conclusion: Node provider rewards are currently not the primary contributor to ICP inflation.Their impact becomes substantial only if there are significant further price decreases.

### Suggested next steps

As our analysis shows, Node provider rewards are not currently a primary driver of ICP inflation. However, due to the concerns raised, it is prudent to gather ideas and prepare plans for different ICP/XDR exchange rate scenarios. Specifically, automated stabilization mechanisms could be valuable if the ICP/XDR rate changes significantly.

**Short-term**

The NNS framework already includes a minimum ICP/XDR exchange rate, called ‘minimum_icp_xdr_rate’ (set at 1 ICP/XDR), which is part of the NetworkEconomics configuration. Due to a bug, this minimum exchange rate is currently not enforced.

As a short-term fix, we recommend resolving the bug to apply the minimum exchange rate for the calculation of node provider rewards and incorporate this in an upcoming NNS release.

Once this bug is fixed, the minimum_icp_xdr_rate parameter would serve as a tokenomics limit. This would directly address concerns about a potential inflationary spiral by effectively capping the amount of ICP minted for Node Provider rewards. This cap would apply if the ICP/XDR exchange rate fell 60% from today's value (between scenario 1 and 2 above)

**Mid-term**

In parallel, further potential refinements should be reviewed, many of which are already topics of forum discussions. For instance:

* Size of Node Population: Assess the current node population and determine the required number and geographic distribution of nodes for adequate network capacity and decentralization.
* Reward Mechanism Refinement:
  * Consider distributing the burden of any reduction in rewards under extreme rate scenarios. For instance, both node provider and voting rewards could be decreased if the ICP/XDR rate drops below a certain level.
  * Explore mechanisms for tracking deferred node provider rewards for potential future payouts.
* Subnet Usage: Consider tying node provider rewards to the actual usage and cycle consumption of individual subnets. This could potentially be coordinated with a review of cycle pricing, which directly impacts cycle consumption.

I think this is a perfectly reasonable course of action to take - ensuring Node Providers are still rewarded, while setting in place the limitations to prevent a death spiral.

I’m looking forward to seeing how these concepts evolve into a proposal. I appreciate the foundations openness to feedback & critical thinking in this regard.

First of all, thank you to @Accumulating.icp for making enough noise that the Foundation has noticed and addressed this imminent issue. Second, thank you @bjoernek for actually providing a very reasonable solution that addresses the need to reward node providers without sacrificing the entire blockchain. It's nice to see the Foundation is willing to take action before we reach a "point of no return" scenario.

@bjoernek can you explain how a *minimum* ICP/XDR rate would address the concern of run-away inflation brought on by node provider rewards? If node providers payments are denominated in XDR and dispersed in ICP then the amount of ICP that a node provider receives is calculated by the following:


Rewards = (amount owed in XDR) ( ICP/XDR exchange rate)

If we mean to put an *upper* bound on the value of the Rewards, how is that achieved by placing a *lower* bound on the ICP/XDR exchange rate? 

We would need to place an upper bound on the ICP/XDR exchange rate. *Not* a lower bound.

Placing a minimum on ICP/XDR  has severe consequences downstream for people purchasing cycles when the price of ICP rises to a point where the true value of cycles falls below that lower bound. 

And placing a maximum on ICP/XDR has severe consequences in that it’d result in cycles costs being under valued whenever the true costs of cycles reaches a point in which it exceeds that upper bound. 

this is not a short term solution at all. It causes too many hazardous side effects.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-09-15 13:53:04 UTC | #5

@Jesse 
I believe your question is related to the notation convention for the ICP/XDR exchange rate. 
* As of today, the rate stands at 2.22, meaning you need 2.22 XDR to get 1 ICP. 
* Assume say you are a node provider who is supposed to receive rewards equivalent to 1000 XDR every month. 
* With today's rate, that would convert to 1000 / 2.22 = 450 ICP. However, if the exchange rate drops to 1.50 ICP/XDR, you would receive 1000 / 1.5 = 666.7 ICP instead. 
* This is why having a floor for the ICP/XDR exchange rate effectively caps the ICP amount (in our example to 1000 ICP). 

I hope this helps.

-------------------------

9o0rl | 2023-09-15 14:05:29 UTC | #6

If we were to assume a worst case scenario, and the ICP price fell by another 60% resulting in the exchange rate cap coming into play (which given the current market conditions, it would not be far out of the realm of possibility), then from there NP's would start receiving a reduction in their earnings. The risk described in reducing NP rewards has been that it would cause them to go offline. I think it would be appropriate at this point to assess the risk relating to at what point would NP then begin to shutoff due to non-profitability and begin to effect network stability? The NP's have how much profit built into their operations? It varies from NP to NP but is there a range of estimates and a plan for this eventuality? The mid-term strategies described above would help but there isn't really a timeline for when any of these will be implemented so in the event that the cap comes into play sooner rather than later, there would be some lag before these mid-term solutions are activated.

Thank you very much for your day-to-day work! Many people give their opinion hastily without knowing the number of qualified people analyzing all the variables. Give an idea, ask, analyze, propose, it's perfect! But many people try to impose something that they thought at home for 1 week. All this will change when the price rises, that is where %50 of the forum posts will decrease.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-15 15:54:51 UTC | #8

Thank you for explaining this. 

If i understand you correctly, the notation is misleading as it doesn’t follow proper nomenclature. The minimum_icp_xdr_rate  variable is actually referring to the XDR/ICP exchange rate. So it’s the XDR/ICP rate that you’d be placing a lower bound on. *Not* the ICP/XDR exchange rate. 

This would *still* cause issues downstream whenever the true XDR/ICP rate falls below this lower bound. The result would be that cycles costs are subsidized by the entire network even more than it already is. 

This is still very haphazard, which speaks to your point that this needs ongoing discussion.

I urge everyone following this topic to consider the solution i propose in [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/solution-for-preventing-node-provider-rewards-inflationary-death-spiral/23045?u=jesse). So far, it is the only proposed solution that addresses the risk of run-away inflation by decentralizing risk while preserving incentives to current and future node providers- *and* it achieves this while not raising the barrier to entry for future node providers. 

I’m open to hearing other people’s recommendations, but i firmly believe that any recommendations should fulfill the following: 

1.) takes into account the operation expenses of node providers in a way that doesn’t remove all economic incentive for Node Providers to contribute to the network.

2.) mitigates the risk of run-away inflation as a result of node provider rewards dispersals.

3.) mitigates the risk of all other neuron stakers being diluted by rewards paid out to node providers.

4.) Decentralizes risk. Currently, if ICP’s tokenomics breaks down, the result is run-away inflation on the entire NNS. A solution in which the risk is no longer centralized to the NNS, but instead passed onto the Node providers so that risk is decentralized would be optimal.

5.) Refrains from raising the barrier to entry for future node providers looking to contribute to the network.

I don't consider myself very smart, but it seems coherent to think about a treasure pool , which would exchange ICP for stable value in Automatic way with AI  through a smart contract when market conditions were favorable and thus prevent harming the price of ICP. From that pool the NP would be rewarded  in stable currency

-------------------------

Jesse | 2023-09-15 16:02:53 UTC | #12

I’m not opposed to this but there would need to be a funding source established for this treasury. I also think that if this is enacted, it should be done in conjunction with a more comprehensive solution.

sagcryptoicp | 2023-09-15 17:59:12 UTC | #13


If the price of ICP falls below $1.30 USD(1 XDR), node providers will receive less money than they are supposed to receive.

For example, let's consider one node. If the current ICP/XDR rate is 2.22, the node provider should receive 694.59 ICP.

However, if we set a lower limit for ICP/XDR at 1, then whenever the price of ICP drops below $1.30 USD (1 XDR), the node provider will always receive a maximum of 1542 ICP, regardless of the actual ICP price at that time.

Is it correct calculation?

Thanks so much for addressing the community. 

All makes sense apart from tying node provider rewards to actual consumption. Node providers have no control which subnet they are a part of nor do they control how much consumption takes place on their nodes. This design choice would make no sense!

Forgive my ignorance, but what percentage of Nodes are actually “load bearing”?

Is there a 98% disparity between cycles paid to utilize a subnet vs what that subnet is paid out, or is the network currently 98% oversized in comparison to where it should be (actual useage)?

I just can’t seem to figure out why we continuously onboard new Nodes if we don’t even have a usecase for them - you’d think if our subnets / nodes were currently overworked, the cycles burnt would reflect that.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-09-15 19:29:27 UTC | #17

It entirely makes sense. If we don’t need them at all why are we adding new ones like accumulating.icp has said. 
If we want to have it to where anyone can be a node provider at any time then it should just be a fixed rate of icp that’s allocated to a node reward pool and distributed based on the nodes volume.
But not everybody can be a node provider so there is a barrier of entry. This barrier of entry should be much more strict right now with the current state of the chain with onboarding new nodes. Like a year or two ago it was extremely strict and now you see nodes Beijing added more than ever.
Why is this occurring if we do not need right now? We’re pretty much just paying off nodes to just sit in a datacenter and do nothing. 
So I think it’s justified to pay out nodes that are actually being used and nodes that are not get a smaller amount of rewards.

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2023-09-15 20:32:43 UTC | #18

If new nodes aren't onboarded, wouldn't that essentially stop decentralizing the protocol? I was thinking the use case for any additional nodes is decentralization.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-09-15 23:18:19 UTC | #22

If decentralization is the goal remove the barrier to entry and let anybody become a node provider and have a fixed amount of icp for every month similar to proof of work but whatever node are used the most get a specific percentage and ones that aren’t used at all get nothing.

-------------------------

opaf64 | 2023-09-15 23:51:10 UTC | #23

Hmm, the problem might have more to do with liquidity than token existence. 

How much voting rewards are liquidated within 1 month of receipt? Low.

How much node reward is sold off within 1 month of receipt. Higher. 

Eg, satoshis initial mined btc is perceived to be illiquid even though it exists. 

Regardless, I'm not sure how much any of this matters.

-------------------------

superduper | 2023-09-16 02:54:49 UTC | #24

besides this artificial floor it may be prudent to perhaps offer nodes who do not sell any ICP ( and those who use it to buy cycles) over some weighted period of time the chance to earn some of the cycle's ICP burned if cycles's icp burned exceeds the node and voting rewards in some time period (per day, or rolling weeks i suppose). this would make cycles burns slightly less deflationary but could be a carrot that can spur more decentralized marketing of the IC by node operators (sort of how BTC miners evangelize bitcoin)

in this case node operators who hodl the ICP they earn or who spend it inside the ecosystem (burning icp for cycles), have an added incentive to market the IC app developers.

we should take this opportunity not to punish the node operators for what is not their doing, and while adjusting for this extreme situation also offer them carrots that align with growth in cycles usage.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2023-09-16 03:22:49 UTC | #25

To ensure fairness, it's also crucial for Dfinity to reevaluate its marketing strategy to stimulate demand. I have an idea that I've submitted a feature request, which you can find [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/feature-request-for-sovereign-decentralized-file-storage/23095). 

This request represents an initial concept that has the potential to boost demand for computational cycles. While this may not fall directly within your scope of responsibility, if you can pass it along to the relevant individuals in dfinity who in charge for this area will be great.

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-09-16 16:18:30 UTC | #28

@bjoernek 
The problem statement makes perfect sense. It's essential to realize that modifying the NP rewards approach might inadvertently affect not just NP investors but also the overall perception and trust in Dffinity's commitments. Decisions made now have repercussions that could echo in the platform's long-term credibility.

Drawing from my experience and observation, I believe that the biggest area ICP could significantly benefit from is enhanced marketing and outreach. The platform could achieve more widespread adoption with effective marketing. Take a look at what google cloud did for large scale adoption in the Asia pacific where I was part of it. To any enterprise, sales and marketing are the lifeblood that ensures sustained growth and visibility. Whatever short or midterm strategies are in place to slow down inflation will not be enough. Let's address the elephant in the room "Visibility and Adoption"

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2023-09-16 18:17:14 UTC | #29

**Agree**, finally. All the technical advancmements and the outstanding r&d team are on the very next level. We have https outcalls, ckBTC, soon ckETH, the SNS option, Openchat , soon AI, and so on. 
**ICP is more then ready for mass adoption to take place.** 

**The lack of a massive marketing campaign** is what is holding it back **big time**. All the other big "chains" always have & had big marketing and weak r&d, wich **still** puts them at the fore front of the mainstream audience. 

ICP has the greatest advancements in blockchain, but it is going under because nobody is reporting about the advancements to the mainstream, consequently there is no significant adoption. Attending blockchain events is great and important, aswell as being active on twitter. **But** it is clearly not enough to draw mainstream interest.

**As** [MalithHatananchchige](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/MalithHatananchchige) **said,** this could turn things around without modifying NP rewards and impacting the overall perception and trust in Dfinity’s commitments.

Suddenly **modifying NP** rewards could also rub them the wrong way. To suddenly change their rewards, would go in the same direction wich occurs when building on AWS "**platform risk**", the platform suddenly changing underlying fundamentals, **wouldn't it?**

Instead **consider** launching a **massive marketing campaign** to **gain visibility & adoption**.

Thoughts?

I’m sorry, but the math here makes no sense to me at all, and I am an engineer. 

So you defined the ratio as follow: 2.22 (ICP/XDR)

Okay, and assuming we receive rewards equivalent to 1000 XDR, how many ICP would that be?

ICP amount = 1000 (XDR) * 2.22 (ICP/XDR) = 2220 ICP

I don’t know why you were dividing. Your units don’t even cancel out. In the above calculation the units do cancel out.

Please correct me if I am getting something wrong, but I’m pretty sure you shouldn’t be dividing.

ajismyid | 2023-09-17 02:40:21 UTC | #31

While we understand that Dfinity is a "not-for-profit organization" and the Internet Computer protocol resembles a "non-profit public internet infrastructure", it still needs to be managed with a business mindset, akin to a corporate entity. The key distinction here is that it's not managed for maximizing profit, but rather to strike a balance between supply and demand.

Currently, I've observed that the community is exerting a considerable amount of effort on the supply side. However, there are limitations to how low the supply can be tweaked before it begins to negatively impact the protocol itself.

In my view, the lack of discussion on the demand side is the primary reason for the low consumption of computational cycles. This leads us to the question: What metrics should define a successful marketing strategy in the case of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)? Using the wrong Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can yield misleading results. If we measure success solely based on metrics like the number of Internet Identity (II) creations, canister creations, or active developers on GitHub, it may appear as a successful marketing effort. But is this the most important metric for measuring successful usage adoption?

From my perspective, it all boils down to economic fundamentals. The most crucial metric to monitor is cycles consumption because it directly relates to the supply and demand dynamics of the tokenomics.

In my opinion, ICP should consider developing 'products' or 'services' that are closely tied to real-world usage and cycles consumption. Prioritizing products or services that generate sales should be a part of building this essential infrastructure layer.

While I understand that these endeavors are typically the responsibility of projects built on ICP, given the current market conditions and difficulties in securing funding, many projects are currently on hold.

To address this situation, it might be prudent for Dfinity to step in proactively and create basic products or services that can generate demand and absorb excess liquidity in the interim.

-------------------------

tina23 | 2023-09-17 05:39:20 UTC | #32

No, his calculation is correct. 

1 XDR = 1.3 USD
1 ICP = ~3 USD => 1 ICP = ~2.3 XDR

-------------------------

tina23 | 2023-09-17 05:47:35 UTC | #33

Great topic, some of my thoughts on this as well. I personally think there are two slightly separate issues here:

1. Node providers contributing to ICP inflation - this doesn’t really seem to be the case to a significant degree as that appears to be mainly driven by other factors from some of the statistics shown and maybe that is where one should look first.
2. Overcapacity of nodes (i.e. 50% of nodes just “awaiting subnet”). 

In regards to point 2, I think a certain degree of overcapacity is necessary, in order to allow for sufficient capacity to be present when ICP starts to scale more, because adding nodes is not a quick process. Even assuming there would always be potential node providers ready to jump and add nodes, the steps to become a node provider are not quick. Just getting through all the proposal steps would take around 3 weeks at best. One also has to negotiate with data centres, and then, crucially, procure the hardware. The type of node machines required are quite high spec and at the very best procurement lead times are around 8-10 weeks….if there are chip shortages and the like, this can also increase to 6 months. Then one also has to ship them to where they need to go - particularly for non-EU/US based node providers this adds complexity, as they often wouldn’t be able to procure locally. So it can be quite a lengthy process to add nodes. Therefore having a certain overcapacity of nodes in the network at any given time is probably prudent, does it have to be 50%? Probably not, but maybe 20-25%?


Right now the top 13 node providers (each having more than 40 node machines) account for 66% of all node machines. And 87% of these node machines are EU and US based. I think this is probably where I would start to take a look. How many of these are Gen 1 machines? I understand it’s normally a 4-year business model and the life of the node machines are assumed to be 4 years, so quite a few of these may come up to the 4-year mark soon? (I don’t think this information can be found on the dashboard). They should then be phased out and not renewed. And given such heavy EU/US concentration and only nascent emergence of nodes in other countries, it may make sense to not allow any more additional nodes in EU/US and focus on adding nodes in the rest of the world for decentralisation. Yes, adding nodes outside EU/US is often a bit more costly because bandwidth costs are significantly higher and requires a bit higher node provider compensation, but this is also changing as time passes. And one should probably think about setting a lower limit per data center and location for the maximum number of nodes, to ensure adequate decentralisation (maybe 20 nodes or so, right now there are some of these top node providers with more than 60 nodes all in one data center). Lastly, Dfinity themselves run more than 90 nodes total in EU/US, I guess they must all be Gen 1 nodes. I understand if they wanted to run a few nodes themselves for development purposes, but that should only be a few, so maybe these can be the first ones to be reduced/phased out, while allowing for some additional nodes to come online in the rest of the world to drive decentralisation.

BHare1985 | 2023-09-18 04:18:01 UTC | #34

It's 2.22 XDR per ICP (XDR/ICP).  The graphs all say ICP/XDR which will be 0.45, which is a mistake @bjoernek made.  0.45 ICP = 1 XDR  or  1 ICP = 2.22 XDR

Note that `X/Y` is the standard notation for [currency pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_pair). `X/Y = z` means that `1` `X` is traded for `z` `Y`.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-09-18 12:18:14 UTC | #36

@Jesse @Qasmi1216 @BHare1985 

To extend on what @THLO had mentioned: 
- In the post and the example given, I have used the standard notation for currency pairs. Stating that the ICP/XDR exchange is equal to 2.22 means that 1 ICP corresponds to 2.22 XDR. 
- An easy trick to remember this convention is "ICP/XDR = 2.22" can be  re-arranged to "ICP = 2.22 XDR". 
- However ICP/XDR is NOT the unit of the exchange rate, which to my understanding created some confusion. 
- So in summary, if you want to convert a given XDR amount (e.g. 1000 XDR) to ICP, then you need to divide by the ICP/XDR rate (e.g. 2.22). 

I hope this clarifies !

The idea is to apply the ICP/XDR exchange rate floor only in the calculation of node provider rewards (which is done in the NNS governance canister) and not in the context of cycles minting (which is done in the cycles minting canister). Does this address your concern?

bjoernek | 2023-09-18 12:16:51 UTC | #39

Thank you, @Accumulating.icp. I agree that the ICP protocol should have clear criteria or a model to determine the number of nodes needed both now and in the future. This model should take into account a variety of factors, including network diversification across node providers, data centers, and countries, as well as cost considerations, required spare capacity, and incentives for node providers. I plan to share some analysis and suggestions on this topic soon.

This is not a solution but more of a tool so everyone could see the decentralization aspect
 of upcoming data centers. The node map on the dashboard could have another node marker included for proposed data centers. Then everyone can visually see if the DC is actually helping to decentralize or if it lies within the bounds of current node overlaps. After the proposal is complete it could then be changed to upcoming(if adopted) or removed(if declined).

Another visualization could be color coding overlaps. 
 No overlaps, no color = nodes are contributing to decentralization optimally. 
 1 overlap, yellow= nodes are contributing to decentralization within acceptable parameters. 
 2 overlaps, orange= nodes are beginning to cluster. More nodes in these areas contributes to 
  centralization.
 3 overlaps, red= Nodes are centralized. No further proposals from these areas should be accepted. 

Number of overlaps to trigger color coding could be adjusted to reflect decentralization goals. I will admit that I dont know how many nodes are needed within any given area to optimize coverage. So adjustments are likely necessary to the suggestion but i think a visualization like this would help everyone with decision making as far as onboarding new nodes and data centers.

I wrote about a year ago that ICP should urgently update its tokenomics. The forum administrator deleted my post and warned me. I don't enter the forum anymore either. Because ICP officials are so caught up in technology that they are not even aware that the tokenomics currently in effect is leading to ICP death. Under any circumstances, they must find a way to limit or even stop token issuance. I think it may be too late.

Thank you. I am a node provider and started contributing actively to a thread on addressing the issue of a token price fall triggering an inflationary spiral.  My conclusion was that the issue of a spiral should be taken off the table by imposing an inflation cap - in other words, the network might defer NP rewards. Your proposal is in that vein which is great but doesn't elaborate on two questions: 

1. What would be the exact current and planned trajectory of token inflation under a 1 ICP/XDR limit? 
2. My assumption is that rewards should be deferred - e.g., the cap reduces payment but that a shortfall should accrue and be paid out over a longer term if the cap is imposed.  Is that right?

I do support the idea of a cap based on a target inflation rate (e.g., 12 to 15 percent) but I absolutely do not support imposing a cap based on a "bug". The "bug" of $1xdr/ICP could be right but can someone tell me what our inflation proposal would look like if we adopted that proposal? How hard is it to change the $xdr/ICP ration in the system? What is magic about $1/xdr than you randomly set that limit? It would be irresponsible to support the implementation of such a cap without knowing how it precisely impacts ICP inflation. 

The above proposal is silent as to whether awards should accrue or disappear. Given that different NPs entered under different time periods, I strongly object to any idea of rewards disappearing - they should be accrued and paid out as pricing recovers. This happens naturally under the imposition of an inflation cap. 

Finally, the network should halt onboarding any new NPs where hardware hasn't been ordered. If you want to move, we should look at shutting down existing NPs and giving them the Right of First Refusal on shifting geographically. 

Note: My assumptions have been: 
1.  That the maturity of neurons contributes to a declining percentage of ICP inflation from 10 down to 5 percent over time. 
2, Shortfalls in NP payments would accrue based on the inflation cap and be paid out either as the token price increases or accrue for payment over a longer time period. 

Can you please address the two issues? What does the target inflation rate look like under your plan and second, how reward shortfalls for NPs would be addressed? 
There are a ton of options around the mid-term. Let's not muddy the waters with that discussion at present and stay focused on the issue of pinning down the actions we take to close off a downward spiral. 

Thank you - and I am (and remain) a complete fan of the IC.

bjoernek | 2023-09-22 06:40:25 UTC | #45

Thank you for the follow-up and your questions, @DavidM.

I think that it is  essential to differentiate between the suggested short-term measures  and the mid-term measures:

* **Short-term:** The proposal is to enforce an already existing ICP/XDR exchange rate limit which is contained in NetworkEconomics and which is currently set at 1 XDR. 
* **Mid-term:**
  * Various suggestions have come from the community, some of which are highlighted at the start of this post.
  * One potential approach, as you have also pointed out, might be to monitor deferred node provider rewards and distribute them later. Alternatively, we could consider to distribute the burden of a potential reward reduction among both node providers and neuron holders. Both concepts have their strengths, warranting further discussion and evaluation.
  * Furthermore, as you rightly emphasized, it is vital to evaluate our current node population. This will help us establish the necessary number and geographic distribution of nodes to maintain both efficient network capacity and decentralization. I plan to share more thoughts on this matter shortly.

Distributing deferred rewards that would have gone to node providers to both node providers and neuron holders when node providers are already receiving less than expected is a very clear example to me of a tyranny of the majority. 

It’s very important imho the NNS does not abuse its power and take from some to give to others. It will erode trust in what node providers can expect before they go out and buy hardware. Otherwise when the price goes too high maybe neuron holders should start donating its maturity to node providers (it’s a tongue in cheek suggestion because it makes no sense).

-------------------------

DavidM | 2023-09-23 01:47:57 UTC | #50

I assume the proposal that Bjoern was referring to was the idea if ICP token price drops below the $1XDR causing a shortfall in tokens that the burden of the reduction might be born out of the total reward pool for both Neurons and Node Providers (rewards for everyone get reduced) and consequently, once the token price recovers, then the backlog would be shared among everyone (Neurons and Node Providers). I didn't take it that Bjoern meant diverting catch up rewards owed to NPs to Neurons/maturity. Is that right Bjoern?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-09-23 02:43:56 UTC | #51

Oh that would make more sense… I hope you’re right!

In extreme circumstances of low prices I think delaying all inflation of both neurons and NPs might make sense

Yes, correct this is what I meant, i.e. the burden of the reduction could be shared by neuron holders and node providers. I think tracking of foregone rewards and paying them out later is also an interesting idea but is a somewhat independent measure. I also assume that tracking & later pay out would be more demanding technically.

Hey @dfisher I read the comment from @bjoernek differently than what you described here.  I think he was saying that neuron owners could share the burden of controlling inflation so it doesn’t all fall on node providers.  In other words, node provider reward reductions could be smaller if all neuron owners also accepted reductions.  In Bjoern’s comment, I don’t even think he went as far as defining reward reduction as permanent, temporary, or just a deferral.  All he said was that neuron owners could share the burden if push comes to shove and we need to make changes that prevent inflation from getting out of control.  From my perspective as just a neuron owner (not a node provider), I can agree with this idea of sharing the burden.

-------------------------

DavidM | 2023-09-23 21:20:15 UTC | #54

I like the idea of an immediate fix to the downward spiral issue w/defferal of rewards.  1ICP/XDR threshold may be close enough for this purpose. We should implement something soon. 

There is a broader discussion of rewards that is needed but could be treated separately from this downward spiral issue. And, there should be either a minimum fiat amount or schedule that ensures a floor for payment of the network issue otherwise you swap the inflation spiral problem into a "no one will ever be a node provider" or network shutdown problem. 

Separately from the above, with Short-term interest rates increasing, I think there is a whole discussion around the structure of Neurons/rewards.  None of this has played out as I thought it would - that everyone buying ICP would lock up for rewards and increaing prices would favor staking.  Instead we have the opposite. 

Short-term interest rates combined with Maturity + NP rewards are a train wreck for spot pricing.  You can think of it this way, as a short-term holder of ICP, I pay a tax in terms of maturity and NP rewards to hold an unstaked token. 

The only two reasons I have to hold are that I think there is a short-term possibility of a favorable near-term trade or, the belief that I can't forecast performance well enough but believe that the likelihood of a rapid upswing is such that if one doesn't hold ICP, you will not have sufficient time to buy-in and capture the benefit (ie. ICP has option value). 

I had expected that 90 percent of token holders would stake and that simply never happened.  I think there were a couple of factors that weighed in against that possibility: 
1 The time based release of seed holders and others over a prolonged period. This causes sell pressure over a long period of time. Instead of one quick exit, you get a steady and protracted sell-off. 
2. Maturity doesn't compound but gets paid out - so inflation can be spent, again causing sell pressure. 
3, No way to lock up people that are fans but are scared of the six month gap to earn rewards

You add in market manipulators, fud, SBF, Sol shenanigans and the lockup freezes at 50%.  Not what we wanted. I saw that Dom had tweeted out that there were proposals for flattening the rewards curve and that seems like it is in the right direction.

Fernando | 2023-09-23 21:45:53 UTC | #55

I was intrigued by the spiral problem and decided to do some analysis that I would like to share. These are just some charts comparing some blockchains that I believe are at a **market** level of comparison with IC.
In some analysis, such as social dominance and trading volume, BTC and ETH were not included for obvious reasons.

**The Circulating Supply:**

![supply-since-04-19-23|1057x944, 100%](upload://hlhhe97E3Tzhp6hU7xekJe4oZGB.png)


- The interval comprises the period after the ICP circulating supply definition has been updated (April 19th).
According to the new definition, noise aside, there appears to be no excess ICP being minted over time compared to other blockchains.


**The Price:**

![Price_top-11-08-21-to-date|690x452, 100%](upload://jkkzcac8kcwIrtMijplioPqTkVA.png)

- This chart shows that when we look at the history, even though ICP's price performance has been terrible, it's not alone. Since the day the market topped (Nov 8th, 2021), the price behavior has been very similar between these projects.

![Price_bottom-11-21-22_to_date|690x452, 100%](upload://zLFeJvJTuGSMpN1hwI2NEi36oka.jpeg)

- Above, the rate (ICP price)/(other crypto price) shows the relative valuation of ICP to others.
To chart this, a significant reference was sought in the market as the price of ICP is only falling. The timeline starts on the day of the - possible - bottom of the BTC bear market (Nov 21th, 2022).
Since then, ICP has performed better than many.


![vs_Alt-Market_bottom-11-21-22_to_date|689x483, 100%](upload://AammVl7CkB357G4szYY4YDjOLwF.png)
- Still, another way to look at price behavior is by dividing "price/(market cap of non-stable altcoins except ETH)". It's kind of a herd effect measure, showing performance relative to the altcoin market as a whole.

**The Direct Price Impact of NP Rewards:**

![node-providers-days|690x385, 100%](upload://c9ttuk13XSLRk3Vn9ZZc7K01bk2.png)
- On the chart we see the price of ICP (candles), the market cap of non-stable altcoins with the exception of ETH (line) and payout days for NP rewards (vertical lines).
More than illustrating the apparent lack of correlation between the rewards received by NP and the price of ICP, what is even more striking is that the behavior of the ICP price is much more dictated by the movement of the altcoin market as a whole.

**The Social Dominance:**

![social-dominance-last-year|690x277, 100%](upload://gUvUGCkzYLYzkS1OAX6uoD5E5sk.png)

- When we analyze social dominance (the proportion of mentions on social media about some cryptocurrency in relation to the total number of mentions of all top100 cryptos) over the last 2y (Aug. 2021 to Aug. 2023), it is clear that ICP is well below most of these projects.
The top lines are SOL, ADA, MATIC. BNB and ETH were excluded from the comparison.


**The Trading Volume:**

![volume-exchange-last-year|690x279, 100%](upload://qYmBYr8EC9yzN2x7Wd8gYQbYYUs.png)

- The lack of engagement on social media, the bad reputation acquired by FTX's manipulation of the launch of the ICP token in conjunction with the terrible timing of the launch (2 days before BTC lost support in the May 2021 correction) and the current market moment ended up not encouraging trading and price speculation on exchanges, leading to low trading volume.

**The Staking Volume:**

![image|317x275, 100%](upload://thMHSdDCKshT95D2fjeRFGOs66H.png)
- Finally, just one more interesting fact, since when staking the volume available in the market is reduced, generating a kind of pseudo deflation. The table shows the proportion of the circulating supply that is in the form of a stake (out of market). More details [here](https://www.stakingrewards.com/assets/proof-of-stake?sort=staking_marketcap&timeframe=7d&order=desc).

**Further Considerations:**
1. Even though the data displayed here does not offer a solution to the "death spiral" problem, I hope the information provided helps in the process.
2. On Sep 17, [CoinMarketCap recorded](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20230917/) total 24h trading volume of 4509737.48 ICP. The NP rewards for the month, according to the [IC dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation), were 729965 ICP. Using @Kyle_Langham's reference that +-65% of NP rewards are sent to exchanges, and assuming they are all sold, the NP Rewards selloff for one month would represent 10.5% of the 1-day ICP trading volume.
3. When the value of the ICP, and consequently the ICP/XDR rate, falls, the number of tokens minted for NP rewards increases, however, the cost of the cycles (in ICP) increases in the same proportion. In a healthy condition, these forces counterbalance each other when the price changes.
4. The operational cost in IC is extremely low, burning little ICP to use, unlike what happens in Ethereum.
5. ICP has suffered a lot since the launch of the token and to this day it still doesn't know what a bull market (altseason) is. This lack of a positive reference in the past kills the enthusiasm of new people who get to know the project. Seems like a scam.
6. Restricting or preventing the entry of new NPs is a defensive way of dealing with the problem that seems like a shot in the foot. Decentralization is a valuable currency in this world.

**Conclusion:**

- As we can see from the charts, the supply-based model is only part of the equation and does not impact asset prices that directly. The effect of the increase in supply with the fall in price is very obvious, but I believe that the weight of this is much less compared to other actors. 
- The ICP problem appears not to be the excess of selling pressure, but rather the **lack of buying pressure**.
- I find the idea of a hard cap interesting as an emergency measure, considering that the bear market does not seem close to ending.
- More force and energy must be put into expanding the ICP name with **A LOT** of marketing, as already [suggested here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-marketing-campagne-brainstorming/23276/14). 

Reinforcing that we need influencers speaking to the masses; volume on social media, on those lists of "moon bags" and "greatest potentials for the next bull run" that people love to speculate about; more buyers of the ICP token, either because they speculate on the price increase, or because they believe in the project.
Sorry if I went on too long.

This is really helpful information.  Thank you so much for working up the data and posting it on the forum in this thread @Fernando.  This seems like a fresh eyes perspective from someone with a statistic / analytics background.  I noticed your forum account is new, but have you been around the ICP ecosystem for long?  Would you mind sharing your background?  I’m impressed with the detailed analysis you provided here.  Thanks again.

Goodmorning! This is really useful information, however I wanted to provide a few clarifications.

You’re referencing a combined volume from Spot, Perpetual & Future Markets, however, only the Spot Market can truly be utilized in this calculation, as perpetual & future markets do not trade real ICP tokens but rather “lots” that represent ICP - in an attempt to “predict” its direction. 

Future & Perp users can only trade with other Future & Perp users, therefor it does not affect the ICP supply.

As such, if you reference spot volume, you’ll notice that **the true volume of ICP is less than a few million dollars**, as depicted in the “Spot” chart below:

Secondarily, while the fiat value burnt will remain the same, and the ICP value increases, this does not offset the current reward ratio of Node Providers.

As of present day, we’re burning .84% of what we reward Node Providers. 

In the instance ICP’s price falls, yes, we’ll be burning more ICP, but we’re still only going to be burning .84% of what we mint, as depicted below:

I'm grateful that the data was so enlightening. thank you for the recognition!

in fact, I "met" the project just a few days ago. Until then I had the same impression that most people have: "a project with many promises, which is not worth investing in because it will never be worth anything". But it was a video from Jerry Banfield's channel that sparked my interest and I started to see it with different eyes and I already dove head first into the study of the IC ecosystem. For the first time I felt that the users' voice counts, so I decided to give my 2 cents here.

I have a degree in mechanical engineering and have been following the cryptocurrency world for some time.

I will try to contribute whenever possible.

You're right. The difference is considerable.
I was looking and luckily I [found an API](https://docs.coinapi.io/) that separates spot volume and extracts data from past dates as well. If it helps, I can share the piece of code I wrote to do this in google sheets.
According the data, the spot volume of ICP on September 17th was approx 2.7mi. If we calculate the percentage change due to selloff, (65% of 729965)/[2.7mi - (65% of 729965)] = 21.3%.

ajismyid | 2023-09-25 03:10:48 UTC | #60

I agree that the main issue with ICP is the lack of buying interest, particularly from the demand side rather than the supply side. But it's essential to be clear about the type of marketing needed. In simple terms, we need to know why people would want to buy ICP.

It's crucial to note that, as a non-profit organization, Dfinity can't engage in marketing solely for stimulating demand from speculative purposes.

In my view, it's better to have people interested in buying ICP because they want to use the network, not just for speculative trading/investing.

To increase demand for network usage, we need products and services that people can use in their daily lives. This way, people will buy ICP because they genuinely like the products, not just for speculation.

Of course, if there are no ready services / products that regular folks can buy, what are we selling? Without any product / services available, there won't be any demand for network usage.

Bjorn, 

The node provider rewards were issued monthly in ICP, calculated by applying a 200-day moving average. When did it change to 30-day moving average?

-------------------------

Bporter1 | 2024-01-14 02:29:30 UTC | #64

Sorry if that is the wrong name.

-------------------------

Bporter1 | 2024-01-14 20:15:44 UTC | #65

I should clarify my situation and I am happy discuss live at any time. I own 21 nodes and I was confused last year why my token awards did not match the 30 day moving average price. That is what we were told and expected.  Katie Peters informed me in September 22 that “they” switched the Spot price for ICP awards to a 200 day moving average from the original 30 day to make it more fair so I was receiving awards at a much higher base price than the market price as the ICP token fell. I needed to sell at the sometime muck lower price to cover taxes, data center fees and equipment cost. Again, Katie told me and actually another node owner who was in the call that we would make it up when the ICP token recovered. I see from your note that it is now at or back to a 30 day moving average again which has negative impact on my finances as I planed for this to be static at 200 day average. I am very confused. Please let me know if I am missing something here and if the calculations changed from 30 to 200 and then back to 30 day moving average for awards. If it did, please point me to the proposal and the vote for this action.  Thank you very much and I look forward to your response Dfinity team. Have a great day and go ICP. I see a bright future for the company.

-------------------------

katiep | 2024-01-15 18:58:15 UTC | #66

Hi Brian! 
The 30-day moving average is still used. I verify this every month. I am quite confused as to what you are remembering regarding a 200-day moving average. I have my spreadsheet proving the 30-day moving average for every single distribution. I would be happy to go over them with you! You've got my email address. 

ICP prices are indeed volatile, so you will either lose some money or gain some money depending on which way the price is currently going. I'm sure you're just as happy as we are that ICP is gaining value!
