Happy Friday, everyone!

We are SO excited to announce that our `docs` and `examples` repos are now public and part of the DFINITY organization GitHub! :tada: We have heard first-hand how important both documentation and sample code are to your own development efforts, so we hope these repos will be a valuable resource to you as you build apps and services for the Internet Computer! This is just the beginning of our open source journey, and we are looking forward to deepening our collaboration with you, our developer community.

Going forward, please feel free to submit issues or suggestions related to documentation and examples on directly on GitHub according to our contributing guidelines. Of course, [support@dfinity.org](mailto:support@dfinity.org) is still available to you for other technical issues and questions related to the SDK and Motoko.

Cheers!
