# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/43c85184884cf0a23ecee4c28177b359579d0fea/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 43c85184884cf0a23ecee4c28177b359579d0fea
```

There is also another version `d353989` ([IC NNS Proposal 124488](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124488)), which enabled QUIC state sync, which will enable nodes to become productive faster after they join a subnet.
* [[bc3cfa9b](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/bc3cfa9b)] Networking: feat: Enable QUIC state sync

This version will be deployed to a few subnets only in this rollout cycle, to get a signal from the production deployment. It will be deployed to all other subnets in the coming weeks.
