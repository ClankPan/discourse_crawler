for my frontend, user nid to login icp first then connect to nnsledger to get balance.  i managed to deploy local ledger canister where candid file and corresponding js/ts interface file will be auto genreated based on dfx.json.   now i want to connect to nns ledger from my local frontend canister to test.   is it doable? can i just change the canister id to switch between my local ledger and nns ledger? can use same local ledger candid file and js/ts file for both? please help.  thanks.

I'm confuse you deployed two ledgers? or what do you mean with "local ledger and nns ledger"?

In any case, few resources:

1. If you want to interact through Icrc end points, you can use the `@dfinity/ledger` js libs (https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/ledger)

2. In `@dfinity/nns` there are some functions for the ICP ledger as well, notable for the account identifier (https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/nns)

3. In Juno I use the ICP / NNS ledger as well. I deploy it as you do and got the declarations locally too, so you can probably have a look at the source code to find the "get the account balance" part if it can be useful: [https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno). More precisely there is my function [getBalance](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/7b37d0655551d6824e167dc51cdae02508a605cd/src/frontend/src/lib/api/ledger.api.ts#L12). I use the above `@dfinity/ledger` library to fetch it.

sorry for confusion.  only one, i follow online guide to deploy ledger cansiter locally for dev purpose.   the flow is local frontend -> local ledger, but now i want to try  local frontend -> nns ledger.   can it be done?  any sample for reference for setup.  thanks.  i will study the resources you mentioned

So here with "nns ledger", I understand "nns / icp ledger on mainnet".

Can it be done? Yes. It's basically the same but you have to set the host in agent-js to `http://icp0.io`, avoid to fetch root key and provide the effective canister ID on mainnet.

That said, not sure why you would call mainnet from local, I would suggest to stick to local.
