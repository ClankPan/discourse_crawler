Super excited to announce that applications are now open for the Tungsten Demo Day! On **Thursday, Sept. 17th**, ten teams building on the Internet Computer will have the opportunity to present their app or project to the entire DFINITY Foundation team.

Teams will be expected to prepare a short five-minute presentation & demo and participate in a two-minute speed Q&A round from the judges, including Dominic Williams (Founder and Chief Scientist), Artia Moghbel (COO), Stanley Jones (Engineering Lead), and Alexa Smith (Developer Partner Program Manager).

The winning team will receive:
