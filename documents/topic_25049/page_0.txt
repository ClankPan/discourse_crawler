Stop your FUD. It is difficult to find people in the blockchain circle who are really patient in doing things. People who are building the ic ecosystem are rare people who can do things with their heart.

> "But you can wake a man only if he is really asleep. No effort that you make will produce any effect upon him if he is merely pretending sleep." ― Mahatma Gandhi

In the vibrant world of Internet Computer, diverse teams are actively contributing to its growth. While constructive criticism is always welcomed, baseless accusations may fall on deaf ears. People who are there just for spreading FUD can't be reasoned. Our commitment is reflected in the tangible efforts, results, and a live product that speaks volumes.

Let our actions do the talking, and those genuinely interested will witness the progress firsthand. Cheers to constructive dialogue and genuine contributions!
