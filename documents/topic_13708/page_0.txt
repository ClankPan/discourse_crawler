We have developed a dapp for the hackathon to read and parse data from NNS/ICO. Is there a way to also access staking/neuron data to for instance tell if someone has an 8 year node of a certain amount? This information would be displayed on a profile page if a user voluntarily logs in with their IID on our dapp.

The idea is that the staking/neuron data would give additional functionalities on our dapp to the user. For example posting on special gated boards, display badges etc... 8 year gang.
