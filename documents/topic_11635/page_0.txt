I'm trying to call the get method from the asset canister and I'm getting the following error:

```
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Call failed:
  Canister: ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
  Method: get (query)
  "Status": "rejected"
  "Code": "CanisterError"
  "Message": "IC0503: Canister ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai trapped explicitly: no such encoding"
```
I am using the following code:
```
export const getJpg = async (key): Promise<{ content: Array<number>; sha256: [] | [Array<number>]; content_type: string; content_encoding: string; total_length: bigint }> => {
    const authClient = await AuthClient.create();
    const identity = await authClient.getIdentity();
    const agent = new HttpAgent({
        identity,
    });
    await agent.fetchRootKey();
    const store: _SERVICE = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
        agent: agent,
        canisterId,
    });


    return store.get({key: key, accept_encodings: [""]})
}
```


I didn't provide encoding when uploading by chunks in the following post.

Does anyone have any insight into what encoding I am supposed to add or what I am doing wrong?

I found this but donâ€™t think it helps other than suggest that @roman-kashitsyn might know how to address your problem.

Hah yeah that would make sense I never gave it encoding

With which encoding the file was uploaded, with that encoding you need to request it. By default, dfx uploads files with `identity` encoding. Try this `store.get({key: key, accept_encodings: ["identity"]})`

I recommend that you familiarize yourself with this [certified_assets canister source code](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/tree/main/src/ic-certified-assets/src) in detail

And I think that [such a functionality](https://gist.github.com/3cL1p5e7/6e5aa3620913ee6020252ef11871502c) will be useful in your project
