## 1. Objective

Proposed by accumulating.icp, a dedicated member of the Internet Computer community, this proposal signifies a pivotal stride in strengthening the foundations of $STACK. At its core, this initiative advocates for the establishment of a formal $STACK Named Neuronâ€”an emblem of community-driven governance excellence. As the representative of $STACK's vibrant interests, accumulating.icp is committed to guiding this currency, renowned for its robust tokenomics and deflationary mechanics, toward a future characterized by active participation and decentralized decision-making.

Our mission is straightforward and unwavering: to cultivate a culture of engagement and empowerment within the Internet Computer ecosystem through the creation of an innovative, community-driven Named Neuron. We envision a landscape where users transcend the role of mere spectators, becoming active contributors whose voices resonate through the corridors of governance. This vision comes to life through sustainable incentive models meticulously crafted to reward users for their voting participation and meaningful contributions to the governance framework.

In this dynamic ecosystem, governance is not a passive endeavor; it's a participatory expedition. With the introduction of a Named Neuron, our goal is to amplify the community's influence in shaping the destiny of $ICP. Through sustainable incentive models, we are not merely urging participation; we are constructing a platform where every vote holds significance, and each contribution is duly acknowledged.

## 3. Pros
The establishment of the $STACK Named Neuron enhances governance participation within the Internet Computer, given $STACK holders directly govern the Neuron in exchange for voting rewards. By creating an additional avenues for community members to actively engage with and vote on proposals, this initiative encourages a broader spectrum of stakeholders to actively contribute to the decision-making processes.

## 4. Cons
Acknowledging the importance of a smooth transition, this proposal offers a temporarily centralized model before shifting control to the DAO. While this phase allows for efficient decision-making and implementation, it is recognized as a transitional state on the path to full decentralization.

## 5. What we are asking the community
We invite the Internet Computer community to actively participate in shaping the governance structure of $STACK. Your valuable insights, comments, questions, and feedback are crucial in refining and optimizing the proposal. Additionally, we encourage the community to cast their votes on the NNS Motion of Known Neuron Registration to indicate acceptance or rejection of this proposal.

I always appreciate when people and organizations in the ICP community decide to become named neurons.  We need more of them, especially named neurons who want to actively participate in governance.  Thank you for developing this project @Accumulating.icp and I hope that you and the $STACK community will find it to be successful.  I voted to adopt.

Do you think that $STACK will just be active on the Governance and the SNS and Neuron's Fund topics? Do you have plans to also be active on the technical topics such as Replica Version Management, System Canister Management, Node Admin, Participant Management, etc?  We need more named neurons to contribute to the decentralization of ICP on these topics, so my hope is that you want to become active and credible on technical topics as well.

Upon Genesis, $STACK will focus on Governance & SNS topics, although I hope eventually it ventures into other governance topics.
