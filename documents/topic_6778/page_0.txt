Hi,
On the Internet Identity the option to add recovery option like seed phrase and also security key only allows one security key to be registered. Can we allow multiple security keys (Yubikey) somehow?

I'd like the back-up option of two security keys, as for some reason my phone/devices defaults to security key only and it won't allow the choice of using a biometric login.

Kind regards

Glen

Hi @YippyWhippy 

You can only add one security key (Yubikey) for recovery, but you can add multiple keys for authentication. So a solution could be to add an additional key for authentication and save it in a safe place.
