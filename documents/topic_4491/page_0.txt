Application subnets are being rolled out through NNS proposals, but access is still limited for now. You should see another announcement coming to the forum soon. In the meantime, you can continue developing and deploying locally, trying out the tutorials, and providing feedback on the tools and documentation.

@gladguy You could use Dfinity partner [fleek.co](Https://fleek.co) for deployment to mainnet. Very user friendly, great support, works like charm!

@lsgunn I'm really looking forward to deploying to mainnet. Developing locally with the provided tools has been very effective for me. I am closing in on an MVP of an application I have been working on. Is there a target date for the proposals to remove whitelist requirements? Should we expect days/weeks/months from now? I'm getting antsy. :slight_smile:

Operational stability is the key to opening up more subnets. If things continue to go well with the new nodes being added, itâ€™s likely that youâ€™ll see an announcement sometime in June.

You can get more insight into the state of the network here:

I know itâ€™s hard to be patient, but hang in there ðŸ˜†.

I do not get it yet - ist the Dfinity mainnet not live yet?

The network is live and new application subnets have been added. The delay is to ensure that all of the subnets are stable and reliable before introducing the increased load that lots of public deployments will naturally put on the system. I donâ€™t know the specifics of whatâ€™s involved, but, in general, the intent is to have a responsible rollout for the long-term benefit of the community.

Hope that helps,
