When testing canister upgrades with the PocketIc tool, I found that making update calls to a canister causes it to skip canister_version numbers in the canister_info management canister method response. Is the canister_version meant to increment on every update call even though there is no canister-change recorded in the list of recent_changes? 

I made a reproducible sample here: https://github.com/levifeldman/canister_version_tester.

Yes, the canister version is supposed to increase upon every update call to the canister although those calls are not tracked in the canister history.
