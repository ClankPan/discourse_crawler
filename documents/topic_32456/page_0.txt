When deployed locally, it works well but after deploying to the mainnet i get this error:

```Error: Canister ID is required, but received undefined instead. If you are using automatically generated declarations, this may be because your application is not setting the canister ID in process.env correctly.```

This error means that the application does not know which canister id to reference.

I have encountered this error when the application cannot access canister-related environment variables from the `.env` file. Therefore, it could impact the setup of the agent that you are using.

1. What is the framework that you are using?
2. What is currently in your `.env` file?

Yeaa thanks, I figured it out already.
I forgot to add a canister id into my canister_ids.json file.

Fixed it already.
