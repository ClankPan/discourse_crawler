We currently run a [survey](https://airtable.com/appKlTyxe2EE0kl8B/pagGZWVyNgp3ZPXtg/form) to collect more information from DeAI projects building on ICP which will also inform our DeAI marketing website and campaign. 

We posted this same form on the @DFINITYDev Twitter account and DeAI Technical Working Group Discord last week. Thank you to all teams who have submitted a response already. 

We are also posting the survey on the survey to make sure that all AI teams are aware and participate if they choose to. 

Please provide as detailed information as possible here to increase your chances of getting featured by **Monday, April 15th EOD during your time zone**: [https://airtable.com/appKlTyxe2EE0kl8B/pagGZWVyNgp3ZPXtg/form ](https://t.co/igtmFHx73Q)
