I found that ledger canister has some interfaces that use protobuf for canister interface:
https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/rosetta-api/ledger_canister/src/main.rs#L648
I guess this is done for efficiency.

But currently dfx and motoko canister only support candid-based interface calls, and cannot call this protobuf-based interface:
```sh
The Replica returned an error: code 4, message: "IC0503: Canister ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai trapped explicitly: Panicked at 'Deserialization Failed: "failed to decode Protobuf message: unexpected end group tag"', /home/peter/ic/rs/rust_canisters/dfn_core/src/endpoint.rs:34:41"
```
So will motoko canister/dfx support protobuf?

It seems like if you want to integrate the registry from a motoko canister, you'll have to build protobufs yourself üò¨

Plus Motoko doesn‚Äôt even allow you to send ‚Äúraw‚Äù IC messages, i.e. it _only_ talks Candid.

You see, Candid is the official interop language for the Internet Computer, but not the only one. Or something like that‚Ä¶
