Edit: this proposal has been in deliberation for 7 days.  A prerequisite for moving forward with this proposal was crowdfunding.  Since no donations have been received, I am retracting this proposal and I have deleted the donation account information from this post.  I will not be submitting this proposal to the NNS at this time.  I appreciate everyone who participated in the deliberation on this topic in a diplomatic and intellectually honest way.  Thank you.

Edit: The recommended proposal reject fee in this proposal has been lowered based on a [counter proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-mitigate-nns-advertisement-spam-a-temporary-solution/15360/70?u=wpb) offered by @marcio below. 

The [proposal 79944](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/79944) today by @ysyms kicks off a potentially new era of spam that we haven't seen too much previously because it comes after we have moved beyond the period of spam for the purpose of financial gain and because it has a political agenda.  Proposal 79944 is spam for the purpose of advertisement.  I think we need a temporary fix for advertisement spam and it needs to get implemented quickly before a trend starts where people use the NNS as a megaphone for expressing their opinions.  

In today's example, the discussion that occurred that prompted @ysyms to launch a spam attack against @zire via the NNS originally started in this [forum discussion](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/who-allows-dfinity-employees-to-represent-icp-officials/15314).  That is where this discussion should have stayed because it offers two way conversation.  In my opinion, the NNS should not be used to announce frustration with a person or with an organization.  The NNS should be used to conduct the  business of governing the internet computer.

The potential problem with advertisement spam has existed since genesis and has nothing to do with proposal weights or removal of the Governance proposal topic from the All Topics catch all category.  It exists because anyone who can execute DFX commands can submit a proposal to the NNS and because the proposal reject fee has always been very low (initially 1 ICP, now 10 ICP).  The long term solution will need to include some mechanism for filtering spam before it makes it to the NNS.  I propose that the short term solution can be to increase the proposal reject fee so spam proposals become cost prohibitive.  Taking this action would help disincentive advertisement spam, but it also will help mitigate spam for financial gain on weekends when the exchange rate proposals are soon removed from the NNS as discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/29?u=wpb) and [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/10).

My proposal is defined below, but I'm open to considering tweaks.

I propose we raise the proposal reject fee to 30 ICP immediately.  If more advertisement spam continues, then we should keep increasing the proposal reject fee until it titrates away the desire to submit spam proposals.  This would be a temporary solution that can be reversed when DFINITY rolls out a spam solution that is a disincentive for all forms of spam.

Willing to discuss this with you. DM me please. I could crowd fund you some.


While, I encourage everyone to vocalize their thoughts and opinions, I do believe in finding an appropriate setting to do so. Personally, I felt the first post/ thread (on the forum) discussing the issues this proposal spoke too was going to be the end of it. I felt that was a more appropriate place to vocalize their frustrations than an actual NNS proposal. However, seeing the proposal in the NNS today made me realize this is not the case. So, I am willing to discuss this further. I just think it needs to be discussed more, before taking any concrete steps. Just so everyone is on the same page moving forward...

-------------------------

Tromix | 2022-09-10 15:56:49 UTC | #3

Would the reject cost apply to all proposal types, or just governance?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-10 16:03:08 UTC | #4

This is a fair/ good question.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-10 16:19:38 UTC | #5

I'd personally like to go further, and create a sub-categories here on the forum so people who need the space to perhaps vocalize their opinions can, and then would get more appropriate responses being that it is the category or appropriate space to do so. I feel, we should avoid shunning community members who may (if anything) be having a temporary lapse of judgement. 

Yet, I do agree. The reasons I voted "Yes" to reverting governance back to 1 is because these spam proposals were especially confusing for me trying to learn the proper procedures. In my mind, I could have been declining important changes that I simply did not read Chinese to understand, so I would have to vote "No". However, *now* it is becoming clear what (or who) was confusing me in the space and thus I agree it needs this immediate response or actions. However, I just want to allow them the opportunity to "come back" if they'd like to. 

Again, I think we should be willing to create the space for individuals to vocalize these concerns in the future. Just not on the NNS. I felt the discord was probably going to be that space, however, it is clear not everyone will do so. Perhaps, creating the space on the forum might be as useful.

The proposal reject fee applies to all proposal types.  It’s also important to know that the proposer only loses the fee if their proposal is rejected.  If the proposal is approved, the proposer keeps the fee.

Whats to prevent someone with a massive stake from screwing with the Ic community by brigading subnet management proposals with huge reject numbers, thus costing routine subnet maintenance hundreds of dollars.

Gotta think what would someone do out of pure spite.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-11 01:51:04 UTC | #9

I’m not sure I fully understand the attack vector you are describing, but I’ll try to answer.  Let me know if your question is still unresolved.

All neurons created at genesis through the first year of the IC were configured to follow DFINITY for the All Topics catch all category, which includes Subnet Management proposals.  Hence, when there is a Subnet Management proposal, approx 98% of total voting power in the NNS is cast by liquid democracy when DFINITY votes.  There is no neuron or group of neurons that are big enough to attack the IC by submitting or rejecting Subnet Management proposals out of spite.  They can be submitted, but they would all be rejected by DFINITY and would be expensive for the proposer.  They can be rejected in protest by individual neuron owners, but they wouldn’t have enough voting power to overcome the liquid democracy available to DFINITY on these critical updates.

Another layer of protection is that DFINITY can vote on subnet management proposals any time.  Their vote on Subnet Management proposals immediately executes the proposal by Absolute Majority due to liquid democracy.  This means they can implement these proposals minutes after submitting the proposal.  In order for a group of neurons to reject out of spite, they would need to add a neuron follow target to their Subnet Management proposal topic so they don’t follow liquid democracy from DFINITY.  If they do that then they risk not voting on other legit proposals they don’t intent to protest.  They become committed to voting manually until they change their follow relationship again.  It doesn’t seem likely that anyone would want to protest in this way.

Here we go again, another neuron holder @wpb asking for coins to create more spam and choose the same path like @ysyms while claiming to be to our benefit. 

This has been kick around before and failed but at least this time you could get some extra coins for yourself

Well at least the proposal today on the NNS by @ysyms seems to be, for the first time, being rejected.

No coins from me and I would suggest that all spam and its supporters are locked out from spamming on the NNS for a 6 month period or maybe for 5 years when @ysyms neuron expires because it is dissolving.

Dfinity in my opinion is a software internet company and not a marketing and advertising company. 

Too many spruikers and not enough making what they claim.

Where in my proposal does it lead you to believe that I would be submitting a spam proposal.  The proposal I will be submitting will immediately change the NNS code if it passes.  If you point me to the miscommunication, then I will be happy to correct it.

Also, every proposal that has ever been submitted by @ysyms has been rejected (except his Register Named Neuron proposal).  Hence, the fact that the latest one is being rejected at this time is not a new result.

I totally respect your lack of support for this proposal.  I expect you will not be the only one.  I’m happy to respectfully agree to disagree on whether this is a new issue and how to handle it.  Thank you for your input.

Zane | 2022-09-10 18:14:23 UTC | #13

I'm tired of temporary fixes to spam which only make the NNS experience worse, if the issue you talk about actually becomes a thing then let Dfinity feel the heat and fix spam once and for all.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-10 18:48:35 UTC | #14

That is a fair suggestion.  I’ll try to explain why I think we should not ignore.  

@ysyms has been around a long time and is a man of action.  He doesn’t just talk about his opinions.  While I don’t agree with the tactics he has used in the past regarding NNS spam, he is a very credible actor.  He has carried out every single NNS spam attack that he has said he would carry out so far.  He has also recognized in prior forum discussion regarding spam that removing the financial incentive for spam is not enough to mitigate the spam problem.  He is right.  This is well recognized.  The proposal he submitted today is an example.  

@ysyms has pointed out that it is very inexpensive to submit advertisements through the NNS.  Same for political commentary.  Someone who is really intent on making a statement could even start submitting lewd photos or, worse, horrifying content via the NNS.  In the past @ysyms has indicated that he will apply pressure through spam proposals to drive change.  I believe him.  He knows what he is doing.  I want to at least give him a reason to think twice about whether or not it is worth it.  

Today it cost $70 to prove a point (or advertise) via NNS spam proposal since the proposal reject fee is only 10 ICP.  That is a form of advertisement that is well worth it to many people.  I believe this needs to change until we have a better way to mitigate spam.

[@ysyms](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/ysyms) has been around most likely 3 years form the neuron information like many of us and we have all had the right to make our thoughts heard on the forum but does not have the right to prove his point by spamming which can only workout badly for him as I told him sometime ago and it looks like his mental health may be in question from the last discussion he put up and I told him to get better.

Any points he has are for discussion in the forum and not spam that he has added to the NNS that takes away from him, no matter how well meaning he claims.

My concern is he may take this a step further and then my warning will come, sadly, true.

All points that have been raised have some resemblance of relevance but the road map shows that these changes will come about in time and not on demand.

Horrible content is everywhere and it will be on the IC so we will have to get ready for the many opinions of others that see what you think is horrible their right.

Personally in my mind I don’t get the spam as it creates rewards for me that I don’t feel I earned and that are not useful. I would think and I am not a programmer that a person could write code that is harmful to the NNS and that is the concern for me not lewd photos.

I have seen this same discussion about the cost of a proposal and nothing has changed and we need something new. Why then can’t we simply lockout a neuron for a period of time when the proposal is rejected that is not in the followers list which should only have Dfinity approved groups.

True but actions speak louder than words, you might not agree with his way of doing things but he highlighted a problem and got the community to actively talk about it, we are lucky all his proposal were meant to increase the rewards and get Dfinity to prioritize a fix. I'm impressed nobody has posted harmful content on the NNS yet considering how many haters and trolls the IC has.

The cost of many neurons would be greater and disable to be used were current spam by @ysms costs nothing and possible fruitful from donations and be updated constantly.

My concerns are his actions proving a point are costly, personally.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-10 20:46:24 UTC | #18

The minimum amount required to create a neuron is what? 1 ICP? The tokens are not lost so it's not a cost plus you'd have to take in account all possible ways to bypass the limitation, e.g make a proposal, then dissolve the neuron after it's rejected and create a new one, personally I'm tired of all these proposed band aid fixes which only make the NNS experience worse for the average user while not completely fixing the underlying issue.

kvic | 2022-09-10 21:24:46 UTC | #19

wpb | 2022-09-10 21:49:01 UTC | #20

I want to make sure there is no confusion.  This proposal is narrowly focused on changing the proposal rejection fee.  I would be open to suggestions for tweaks to what I presented, but not the broader scope that you described.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-09-10 22:31:07 UTC | #21

The Internet Computer (IC) is nothing more than an Internet Computer Protocol that runs software running on node machines from node providers which is called a blockchain network that can create new subnet blockchains to increase capacity.

The IC has a Network Nervous System (NNS) for governing the Internet Computer blockchain

ICP Coin Holders can participate in governance and contribute to decision-making for updates to the IC infrastructure, the underlying foundation or basic framework and network.

The IC makes it possible to build DeFi and dapps, open internet services, and enterprise systems but that process is decided outside of the IC and the NNS and through the CF and SMS.

The nodes and subnets are organized, tracked, and managed through the NNS by stakeholders who own ICP neurons.

There are rules that apply to be able to vote to make these updates to the Infrastructure.

Placing advertising, photos, rants and other proposals for voting is senseless as the IC would not be able to process such information other than to annoy those who understand the purpose of the ICP, Governance and voting.

Such proposals have a limited audience and have no impact on the NNS. It seems that people of very strong opposing views feel they need to take action where their beliefs are not being accepted or practiced.

Taking such steps that are outside of the NNS for financial gains, conspiring and not accepting the voting process will not bring success or change the process through their actions.

The neurons holders as a voter can make limited changes to the IC through the NNS which is only by software property changes that can include the rules to who can vote.

Putting up proposals that have no meaning or substance will give me personal rewards for rejecting their proposals but do nothing more than waste time and disbelieve from the IC teams.

-------------------------

memetics | 2022-09-10 22:36:31 UTC | #22

How long before phishing and scam attempts become problematic from proposals, I think IC need some sort of community screening process before proposals are submitted to the masses

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-10 23:22:27 UTC | #23

This is why I am all for the [Civol](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/civol-community-nervous-system/15277) project implementing the CNS described in thi[s post.](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/civol-community-nervous-system/15277) if it completes its mission I would argue this problem will be resolved.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-10 23:40:54 UTC | #24

if their project does successfully implement their plan to roll out the CNS, in my opinion spam would be resolved because it would directly eliminate the worry. The community has to give the proposal enough positive consensus to actually reach the NNS correct? So, essentially anyone posting harmful content as mentioned would have to become public in some manner. It *should* remove the ability to post these drastically harmful NNS proposals we speak of. I believe @wpb's point in this was to create an immediate (temporary) solution to the issue described.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-09-11 01:13:09 UTC | #25

I thought NNS was indeed designed to be "a megaphone" for people to express their opinions.

Maybe the right claim is "if you don't trust NNS, feel free to join other blockchain ecosystems."

It seems that the battle between DFINITY and NNS is the real battle.

In fact, Dominic should let DFINITY be under the control of NNS in the first place, which may make ICP a "perfect" public blockchain.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-11 02:22:27 UTC | #26

Well said @jsull9, a [Community Nervous System](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/civol-community-nervous-system/15277) (an asynchronous video forum where issues are discoursed and debated with the Community voting its level of resonance or agreement with everything said) would appear to prevent spam proposals entirely. 

The first level of deterrence would be the necessity of putting your face on your spammy message, but if that is overcome the Community will immediately vote you down and possibly out. We are right now developing what we call an *ambient moderation system*, completely decentralized.

A third strong deterrent is the fact that the Civol panelists engaged in discourse before the Community will typically be experts with skin in the game and a reputation at stake. And fourth, it is extremely unlikely that a spammer could even become a panelist as there is an auditioning process and you have to be voted to the top. 

So once the Civol CNS is in place, in order to make it to the NNS a spammer would have be willing to publish a video delivering the spam payload, it would have to then not only avoid detection as spam, but actually be deliberated and voted to consensus by the Community. Only then would it be sent to NNS for ratification. 

In sum, it does look like the Civol CNS will be the end of spam proposals.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-11 03:10:04 UTC | #27

I agree. this *should* be an effective measure. I have seen a few other temporary solutions like @wpb proposed and I think all are worth considering. However, a good question might be what the timeline would be for this? I believe @wpb and others have been trying to come up with a temporary fix until this is implemented all the way. I'm assuming this means it might take a bit more time then the community *wants*. So, I think it might be useful for all of us to make it clear moving forward that what we are seeking is a temporary fix or solution until the CNS design is fully intact. 

That said, I apologize for assuming @ysyms had poor intentions/ is not a credible actor (if he did not), because I am *still* trying to get a read on things admittedly. However, *if* @ysyms is the only one crafting and proposing spam proposals at this point in time, and we seem to have @civolian's solution on the way... Would it not be the consensus of this thread (and overall topic) that maybe we just nicely ask @ysyms if he could refrain from the spam proposals until the CNS is in intact. This way he can see @DFINITY did just grant someone I believe 75k towards the project. Which essentially would be them saying, yes, @ysyms we hear you and the community and we are willing to give out a 75k grant just to attempt at a final solution. Because, if you do look closely DFINITY actually did spend more money than most of us have invested into fixing this problem.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-11 04:16:58 UTC | #28

I want to go a step further and say that if @ysyms is a credible IC member, and has the best interests at heart whichever way we feel they have handled it. Would you please openly engage with the possibility of stopping the spam proposals? 

Would you be willing to work with us on a temporary solution as @wpb among many others proposed for a *temporary* fix at the very least? Until @civolian's project is intact, and implemented, so we can see if this is going to be a solution to your original concerns of spam on the IC? 

If you agree to stop, no one has to crowd fund or change anything, then no one has to overcomplicate the process further making nerves uneasy. 

If right now there is only one spam creator (@ysyms), and we have a solution that has been funded and is in action almost ready for release, then can we not safely assume that if they agree to stop, based on their past willingness to take direct action, then they will in fact stop? 

I would argue, doing so would give room for them to see this solution and then *everyone* could relax knowing

1. nothings changed in the NNS
2. spam is stopped for now
3. A fix for spam will be implemented and has DFINTY's funding
4. @ysyms achieved their goal in all reality which should be celebrated as a community.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-09-11 04:49:19 UTC | #29

Maybe we should also have the ability to add votes on a discussion that has been put up on the Dfinity forum so we can gauge the majority response as a choice instead of a written response, maybe members feel uncomfortable with written responses from other members and then we all have a democratic outcome without the need or before we add a proposal on the NNS.

Maybe add the ability to change the vote as new arguments come up that may have changed our mind.

bjoernek | 2022-09-11 10:06:28 UTC | #30

Thank you for starting this forum post @wpb 

Here is some initial feedback (reflecting only my personal opinion, as syndication within DFINITY will take a few days) 
* I fully agree that NNS proposals do not seem to be an appropriate forum for expressing opinion/frustrations. This forum or other platforms where replies & discussions are possible seem much more suitable. 
* Raising the rejection fees seems like a quick fix for this issue at hand. 
* We should discuss how we can facilitate submissions by community members in case of higher rejection fees. I think the kind of crowdfunding you suggest for this proposal is a good approach (and we should communicate this clearly so that people who are interested in submitting proposals are aware of this). Potentially some community members (who had been crowdfunded) could offer to submit proposals for others. I would be also happy to support here.

Thanks for your response @bjoernek.  I would definitely be happy to help on your last point.  I have submitted many proposals on behalf of others in the past and will be willing to continue performing that service.  If a proposal reject fee is fully funded, then I don’t mind submitting a proposal even if I disagree or I think it will be rejected.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-11 12:36:42 UTC | #32

Raising the fee to 100 will stop the momentum we have for name neurons. I’d rather progress that and deal with a bit of spam.

The following proposal is still a valid,quick solution and pairs nicely with the voter based rewards as well. It would eliminate publicity for all but “spam” from large whales(who likely have financial stake to be heard regardless).  https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206/2

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-11 21:27:45 UTC | #33

I don’t think it will stop the momentum if these register known neuron proposals are crowdfunded and a 3rd party is willing to offer a service to submit these proposals.  

If there were high confidence that a register known neuron proposal will pass (so the proposal reject fee is not lost), then it may not be necessary to crowdfund the full proposal reject fee.  In order to build confidence that it will pass, specific criteria could be defined to justify a lower crowdfund amount.  For example, all register known neuron proposals must start with a 4 day post in the Governance category on the forum, must contain the neuron name, neuron ID, description of the neuron and voting policy, and social media links for the registrant.  If these criteria are met and nobody identifies a reason there would be risk of rejection when submitting the proposal, then the crowdfund only needs to meet a lower threshold.  If these criteria are not met or someone identifies why there is risk, then the full proposal reject fee must be crowdfunded in order for a 3rd party to be willing to submit the proposal for the registrant.  

Of course, there is nothing preventing a registrant from submitting their proposal themselves and paying the full proposal reject fee no matter how high.  The point is just that it is possible to continue the momentum of adding register known neurons at a lower cost using 3rd party submission and crowdfunding.

Making proposals should be very expensive by design. Is somebody you want to make a change to the network then they need to put the money with a mouth is. Every single major blockchain has massive cost to change the protocol. So should the internet computer. At least with the IC you get your money back if it's adopted.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-11 15:15:57 UTC | #35

The difficulty should be having the proposal accepted not getting it on the NNS.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-12 00:56:18 UTC | #36

Total opposite. A proposal should be good enough to get accepted easily. The threshold for acceptance should be 75%, not 50%+1.

I know @ysyms, and he is actually a straightforward and honest young man who expresses his views and puts them into practice, who challenges authority and takes responsibility for his own actions.
The spam proposal by @ysyms is a good test to improve the security of the NNS system. The spam proposal by @ysyms is much better than the real attacks that want to disrupt the IC, and I think @ysyms is helping us to prevent these potential attacks. We should thank rather than denigrate him.

This topic of avoiding spam proposals has been around for a long time, I don't understand why we still need an interim solution to avoid it?

Last time it was raised from 1 ICP to 10 ICP
This time it will be raised from 10 ICP to 100 ICP
In the future it will be raised from 100 ICP to 1000 ICP?
Unbelievable....

I understand that you want to solve this problem, but I would prefer a permanent solution to a temporary one.

[/quote]

That's wishful thinking, everyone has a different opinion on how the same problem should be tackled and it's hard to estimate when consensus has been reached without the NNS.

Platforms like this forum, Twitter, DSCVR, etc.. can become eco chambers and public perception can be influenced by users with multiple accounts. The NNS is the closest thing we have to an actual democratic vote and since governance proposals don't result in immediate on chain actions, I think it's fine to use them as a poll of sorts, if you think about it that's what they are at the end of the day as recent events showed.

On PoW chains consensus on IP is reached when enough miners signal support in the blocks they mine, I see governance proposals as the IC equivalent, a way to get as unadulterated feedback as possible on what the community thinks about a certain topic, but what we really should keep an eye on are the code changes and system upgrade proposals.

I agree but imo only for some topics like tokenomics, 75% might also be a bit too high, maybe 66% + 1? Same as number of nodes to sign a block.

I assume you were writing this response to me.  Please don't interpret this proposal as a denigration of @ysyms.  That is not the intent.  I have a healthy respect for @ysyms and the impact he has had on IC governance.  I have been impressed with how much he has motivated the community to engage in governance over the last several months.  This proposal is intended to address the very real threat of spam attacks that can exist for advertisement or political gain.  As @ysyms has indicated many times on the forum, this attack vector is based on low proposal cost and the lack of any other mechanism to block it at this time.  My hope is that this proposal addresses that issue in a diplomatic and intellectually honest way.  I have no interest in criticizing @ysyms.  I prefer to focus on facts and not personal attacks.

Regarding the proposal reject fee...I don't know the right amount at this time.  I guess it will depend on whether or not there are very many advertisement spam attacks launched.  To me, the fee should be increased until it is just high enough make them infrequent.

From my read, this is my take on a plan.

The NNS is not the place to add ad-hoc proposal but a proposal should be judge and agreed to before going onto the NNS.

This forum is where proposals for the NNS should be raise and argue till a consensus is reached and then all will know the purpose and reason to vote, accept and then no need for a cost of a rejected proposal which could be set at a million to deter spammers and no fear of a genuine proposal not being accepted as we have agreed and secure the success as a community.

MillionMiles | 2022-09-12 09:43:59 UTC | #41

Thanks for your fair comments on @ysyms, really appreciated :heartbeat:. I just want peoples to know what kind of person @ysyms is.

>To me, the fee should be increased until it is just high enough make them infrequent.

Regarding the proposal reject fee. I don't think the spam proposals are now so frequent that we have to take a temporary motion to stop.  79944 is the 1th spam proposal for advertisement, it's not 10th. are we overreacting? :sweat_smile:

The temporary solution only can reduce the chances of spam proposal, But it doesn't completely avoid spam proposal. I think the negative impact is greater than the benefit of the temporary solution.

1. Rising cost of proposal participation makes it difficult for communities or individuals to participate
2. Now there are not too many proposals, but too few. More proposals mean more participation, and more participation means more good proposals are raised.
3. More and more temporary solutions (55141, 70015, and the proposal we now talking about) are causing the community to stop believing that NNS proposal decisions are being made based on long-term benefits.

**My solution:**
In order to avoid the impact of spam proposals on the majority of people, we only need to control the range of people whose spam proposals are displayed. For the majority of people, only proposals with a certain threshold of proposal approval rate (e.g. 10%) will be displayed by default in NNS, which will filter the probability of the majority of spam proposals being displayed without sacrificing the right of the general public to participate in the proposals. 
Of course, if someone wants to see all proposals, they can simply lower this threshold to 0.

**Summary**
I would prefer a complete solution that not only prevents spam proposals, but also has a positive impact on community participation in NNS governance than a temporary solution.

Happy to receive all your response. :grinning:

As long as the current exchange rate mechanism (which is currently responsible for the vast majority of NNS proposals) is in place, the reject fee should not be increased any further.

The reason is that it is always possible for exchange rate proposals to be rejected (usually, due to network issues, preventing the conversion rate providers from casting their votes in time). When the conversion rate provider neurons run out of ICP, the ICP/XDR rate will no longer be up-to-date until the they are topped up.

I agree with those who are in favor of implementing a more permanent solution to the spam problem instead. Personally, I think the first step should be the "voter-based" rewards mechanism discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352).

If the reject fee is to be increased anyway to prevent advertisement spam, this should be done after the [new exchange rate mechanism](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543) is deployed.

I propose to remove ICPMN Neuron from front-end so that they don’t continue centralising NNS with useless proposals like this one. No offense.


100 ICP? Really?


Also DFINITY employees are members of ICPMN. Just saying.

This proposal has nothing to do with ICPMN, but you know that already.  This proposal topic is my suggestion, Wenzel Bartlett (wpb), acting as an individual contributor to governance related to the IC.

Feel free to submit any proposal you want.  If it’s a good one then it will pass.  If it passes, you will keep the fee…meaning that good proposals don’t cost anything.

The ICPMN is very transparent about voting
members and voting policy.  You have been provided this link many times in the past, but here it is again for your easy reference.

100 ICP ? What about if ICP reach 1000$ ? 
Is it really so much disturbing ? Maybe we should continue to ignore the spam. I prefer a bad person who submit a proposal than 1 good one censored by the fees. The situation seems acceptable now. We shouldn’t give them more energy and wait to see what happen in future. Let them lost 10 ICP. Perfection will not exist in democraty. The goal is not to reach perfection but an acceptable level of imperfection.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-12 16:16:59 UTC | #46

I prefer to deal with reality instead of far off hypothetical.  The price of ICP is $7 today, so a proposal reject fee of 10ICP is $70.  That’s all it costs to submit a proposal that the proposer knows will fail before they submit it.  I think the penalty should be higher.  Of course, if ICP price goes up dramatically, then the proposal reject fee should be changed accordingly.

I agree with your point about achieving an acceptable level of imperfection.  That’s why I think we need to increase the proposal reject fee.  The current fee is too low in my opinion.  I think a higher proposal reject fee will achieve an acceptable level of imperfection until better solutions are available.

What exactly do you want people to see?  Are you trying to say that a public neuron owner should not have the right to make individual proposals?  Are you saying that someone who is active in governance by participating with a public neuron should not be allowed to voice individual opinions?

Also, here are the preceding two paragraphs that you conveniently cropped out of your screen shot from our public policy document that tell a very different story from what you are trying to present…

The Neuron Owner shall be formally nominated by the ICPMN Team and approved by the ICPMN Voting Members at least every 12 months.  It is acceptable for the same person to remain the Neuron Owner each year as long as this formal process is followed.

When the Manage Neuron features are implemented in the NNS dApp, control of the ICPMN neuron will be transferred to a group of people.  At that time, this section will change and a different policy on election frequency will be adopted.

cryptoisgood | 2022-09-12 17:20:25 UTC | #49

I would rather make it so only named neurons can make proposals and I would rather just block YSYMS from making proposals for abusing power. 100 icp is too much.


Anyone can become a named neuron to start making proposals. We can block names neurons that abuse their power.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-12 18:12:05 UTC | #50

I'm baffled so many are proposing "solutions" which only make the governance experience clunkier and more centralized: increase rejection cost, timeout neurons if a proposal is rejected, limit proposals to named neurons, etc...

I'd understand if there were no other way, but much better and more holistic solutions have already been proposed, @skilesare's https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352 and @wpb's https://forum.dfinity.org/t/periodic-confirmation-of-neuron-followees/12109 eliminate the spam's financial incentives, so the only problem left to be solved is advertisement and malicious content being posted on the NNS, which would be fixed by adding a "spam" button as a voting option, many other DAOs use the same solution, e.g on Cosmos you can: accept, reject, abstain or report spam (called No with veto). Implement these 3 features and you have a much better NNS experience than with anything proposed in this thread.

-------------------------

rusty.scrivens | 2022-09-12 18:03:52 UTC | #51

Seeing as this is a thread on how to stop potential advertisement spam, I don't think a move from $70 to $700 will affect advertisement spam, advertisement budgets are significantly higher than $700. So the real affect will be to suppress individuals who can't afford to risk the money, and this goes away from decentralization. This will have no impact on whales and companies from coming in and advertising on the NNS, if anything it will clear it up so only they can afford to advertise. 

Bad actors probably won't care and will see it as what it is, a bigger speed bump that they can still just step over. If you can crowd fund enough to make legit proposals, they can crowdfund enough to make advertisement spam proposals.

Also if this is such a big risk and threat to the NNS then I feel like the priority of an actual code fix should be moved up to pri 0 by the Dfinity team and not left to the community hacking together a "fix" that doesn't fix the issue.

kvic | 2022-09-12 20:06:49 UTC | #53

My final submission in regards to the NNS, rewards, dead neurons, activity and spam.

Reading the many discussions put forward over a long period of time I have a proposal that I hope meets all the concerns brought forward from the past to current that I feel need to be addressed.

The first point to consider is about neuron holders. There seems to be 3 types of owners that have focus.

Dead Neurons
Inactive or Following Neurons
Active Neurons

Any neurons added to the NNS have decisions made about the level of rewards due to the quantity of icp and the length of staked time that they will receive for the owner. This should be upheld as any class action or court decisions may be at the cost of the voters on the NNS and not Dfinity.

This would apply to Dead, Inactive and Followers neurons.

Any extra rewards should then be given to the Active neurons.

The Followers list should only have groups that are approved by the active neurons and to Dfinity approved groups to update the NNS.

The NNS should have a link to this forum for nominations and discussions put up for changes to the Followers List and NNS updates for Active neuron holders to participate for extra rewards.

This is achieved by conversing on discussions and voting by Active neuron holders that are in the category of Governance. Voting power would apply as per the structure set out in the NNS and a neuron settings for investment return.

Governance discussions allow active neurons owners to put up discussions and would have a voting scale that when the levels of 75% has been achieved or as stated by the NNS the votes are transferred to the NNS for updating without further voting.

Any spam would have to come through the forum and I would assume that spam would not produce a result and be rejected.

The default cost of a rejected proposal on the NNS set to 1 billion so any hacks would fail and all updates for the NNS by the Approve Followers List must also come through the Governance discussion but all Follower neurons votes must be included in the voting.

As for the argument about a resubmit of the owners neurons to Follow after a set period must be avoided.

This is my suggestion to fix the spam concerns but to include all the issues raised to get all active neurons involved with their concerns included.  

This is my read on all the topics on this subject over time and I have bundled it all together as a possible solution not the rule.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-12 20:42:00 UTC | #54

I like your idea.  I wonder how much work it would take to implement.  There could be an NNS proposal to block named neurons from submitting proposals (perhaps with a timer), which would ensure it is “hard” to block a neuron and the majority of the governing body agree they should be blocked.  This idea might be a good discussion in a dedicated forum topic since it is not aligned with this proposal.  If this feature were implemented, it could make it practical to decrease the proposal reject fee.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-09-12 22:47:17 UTC | #55

This is obviously a bad idea. You may just make NNS more centralized.

I'll point out that the need to mash the "spam" button is only an issue if the vote counts for rewards.  It seems to me that in an ideal world the spam proposals won't count...if we have a way to keep them "hidden" until we have to deal with them then we can do this.  Maybe we still need a spam button, but with https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206 we might not(depending on the threshold we pick).

coteclaude | 2022-09-12 23:33:41 UTC | #57

I do not agree with this statement that a good proposal will pass and bad ones will be rejected.  I have seen a very bad proposal passed.  Proposal 48623 was to evade tax, for a limited number of individuals, and was not benefiting the IC network at all and it passed.  48623 was a spam to my interpretation of spam, the worst spam seen so far that have the potential to harm the network much more than all the others we have seen.  That will happen when IRS will be stepping in.  100% convince it will happen.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-13 00:52:04 UTC | #58

Personally, I am going to vote for the proposal made by @skilesare mentioned above. I think that a temporary solution might not be needed when we have a few solid long-term solutions available, and they will make the user experience more enjoyable.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-09-13 02:29:28 UTC | #59

Maybe you are wrong ---- Proposal 48623 is indeed a good proposal as a whole.
A proposal is good because it is passed, not that a proposal is passed because it is good.
No one can define what is good or bad; only the voting results of NNS can define what is good or bad.
Of course, different voting rules will make different definitions of what is good or bad. But the truth is that there are no perfect voting rules according to modern social choice theory (i.e., Arrow's impossibility theorem).

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-13 02:53:04 UTC | #60

You are right.  Maybe I am wrong.  But maybe I am right too.  Only time will tell.  Some proposals will take some time before being proven wrong or right.
As much as I follow the SEC and IRS stance and evolution on cryptos and rewards, I can only think that this was a bad proposal that may put some investors in a bad situation with their taxes.  Again, time will tell.  But we cannot deny that there is an important risk.  If this happen, it will create a crisis for sure.  Not to FUD but being realistic.  Don't play with IRS or SEC.  Their stick is much bigger and hit much harder than our.

One thing for sure, that proposal was not following Dfinity guide on proposals which one criteria is the need to benefit to the IC.   That proposal is not benefiting the IC.  It benefit some, and only some, individuals and Dfinity foundation, not the network.

-------------------------

marcio | 2022-09-13 07:11:29 UTC | #61

Isn't it easier to just add a "second" button? Not seconded proposals are "hidden". As long as you can submit a proposal it's easy to raise awareness. 

Then you can control in the UI the details, eg "see proposals seconded only by Dfinity", "see proposals seconded by X% threshold".  

I don't get why so much discussion and this issue is still unsolved.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-09-13 08:55:54 UTC | #62

Why not 150icp?
Or 300?
Or even 1000?
Add a 2nd button in every proposal of
Spam.  Not Spam
If the proposal is spam by voting decision then neuron is banned forever and 0 rewards for everyone.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-13 10:20:50 UTC | #63

In my opinion more voting options in general are needed, regardless of the combination of solutions the community chooses to implement:

- Abstain to make sure people who don't feel they are informed enough and don't want to delegate their vote can still get rewards 

- Spam so that malicious proposals can be more easily detected, filtered and deleted, for instance with https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206 proposals without enough **Yes** votes would be less visible and that shouldn't be the case, there should be a distinction between "*I don't support this*" and "*this is spam*". With a spam option it could also become possible to charge the rejection fee only if the proposal is considered as spam, incentivizing more people to participate in governance without fear of losing tokens, this would promote more named neurons submissions and a more active governance process. 
The NNS is the best tool we have to gather the community's consensus, being able to use it even for apparently disliked proposals will give us a better idea on how much stakers actually support or dislike a proposal.

Because most changes that help solve the problem take time and resources to develop and implement.  DFINITY resources are working on other projects and there are currently no incentives to enable the community to develop and implement the solution.  There is only one mechanism build into the NNS that can help mitigate spam and that is the network economics proposal type that can be used to increase the proposal reject fee.  Everything else takes time and resources.

That fee is the narrowly defined scope presented in this proposal.  None of the other ideation that has occurred in this forum topic (even though I agree with some of it) is in scope here.

-------------------------

FGhostwriting | 2022-09-13 13:47:28 UTC | #65

I understand the concern, but I think 100 ICP for rejection is gatekeeping. The average user loses the ability to create a proposal, which is the opposite of decentralization. 

How about keeping the 10 ICP rejection fee and adding a waiting period if a proposal is rejected? For example, if this ysyms person has a proposal rejected, they lose their 10 ICP and can't create another proposal for 10 days.

Could they geta round it by posting 10 proposals at once? Sure, but then they lose all 100 ICP when the 10 are rejected AND they can't propose again for 100 days (10 x 10).

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-09-13 13:54:44 UTC | #66

All I want to say is, please don't do that, I meant don't raise the proposal reject fee to 100 ICP, all you need to do is just stay clam and not panic, imo, I meant just forget the crazy guy until you become crazy, moreover, burning some 10 ICP is good for the community anyway.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-09-13 15:06:26 UTC | #67

Anyone can be a named neuron. It’s not centralized at all no need to fear it. 

It’s pretty clear not everyone should have a voice. @ysyms has proven this by abusing it.

Pwoseidon | 2022-09-13 15:07:20 UTC | #68

The IC was created by some of the brightest minds in existence.

In a hundred years people will look back at the blockchain renaissance the same way we look back at Einstein’s time, which was a Renaissance of natural science the likes of which we have yet to match.

Surely there are better ways to address spam than raising the cost to 100 ICP.

By raising the cost you are gatekeeping. 

The SNS is already in the hands of gatekeepers, now this? 

Someone like myself simply couldn’t afford to pay 100 ICP for a proposal. This is absolute ludicrous. 

If this ends up a proposal on the NNS and passes, I will humbly part ways with the IC. I’d rather find a chain and community more in line with Web3 philosophy.


Thank you and take care,

First, I want to say thank you for offering a counter proposal that stays within the narrow boundaries of my original proposal.  I really appreciate the tactic you used to arrive at your recommendation.  I am willing to accept your recommendation of 30 ICP.  I will update the original proposal with this new proposal reject fee recommendation.

Second, it should be noted that, as stated in the original proposal, a prerequisite for me to submit this proposal is that it must be fully crowdfunded.  So far, there have been no donations.  Hence, I will not be making this proposal if it is not crowdfunded.  I consider crowdfunding to be a reasonable method of validation that a proposal is worth making to a least a fraction of the governing body.  In some ways, it’s like having the proposal “seconded” by others.  If it does get crowdfunded, then the proposal will be to increase the proposal reject fee to 30 ICP based on your suggestion.

In fact, raising the rejection fee to 100 ICP is a crazy idea.

skilesare | 2022-09-13 23:39:49 UTC | #75

I haven't said much in this thread, but I'll note that I generally dislike "sticks" and prefer "carrots".  10 ICP is already a hindrance to aggressive experimentation with the NNS. I'm staunchly against a higher amount. I'm doing all I can to get the threshold back to 1ICP because I think that is where we find the most experimentation and ability to find the best ideas.

I'm very against punishing neurons as it could be used as a weapon or threat in unanticipated ways.  Instead, we should incentivize them to be well-behaved (Sybil is the real problem here as anyone can always spin up a fresh, anon neuron).

Punishments for Neurons discourage doxed participation in the same way that higher ICP fees discourage participation.  They are just minus ideas when we should be thinking about win/win scenarios.

I've linked to what I think are better ideas that require very few code changes elsewhere on the thread and in other topics.  The Threshold solution imposes a burden but not a penalty and it is a very low burden that should not be a deterrent for any reasonable NNS proposal.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-14 00:05:22 UTC | #76

This community is getting divided more and more.  I now see on Twitter some strong supporters giving up, frustrated with the NNS and how this works.  The 50% + 1 certainly lead to division, TMO.
The problem as to why it will be getting worst and worst is because we are locked in with our financial and cannot go away, like some people have asked.  So looking at other blockchain is impossible if you had faith before in IC enough to lock some investment at first.  Unlock my 8 years for 3 minutes and I would be the first one to leave you all alone.  Believe me.  No matter the lost.
Temporary fixes, try, fail, rinse and repeat is a very bad business strategy.
Having blockchain scientist managing taxes is bad business strategy
Having investors only voting on tech development is bad business strategy
Having blockchain developper creating an election system (NNS) is bad business
 strategy.
Can keep going like this.... but will stop here.  
For success, need a specialist team for each department so they take the right decision.
It is a free for all right now.  Dfinity should take a pause and think about all this.  Why so many people unhappy, frustrated, always seems to be fighting?
It has been 18 months now.  NNS is getting worst at dividing people, not better.  So, this is the first major flaw to fix.
Sad to see.

Temporary fixes, try, fail, rinse and repeat...

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-14 00:25:16 UTC | #77

And will add to this that the NNS team is not too buzy to program permanent fixes.  They have and are still spending tons of time on the ultra complicated tax modulation stuff where 49% of voters have voted against and has absolutely NO benefit to IC.
Clearly a lack of establishing the right priorities

I understand what you are saying and I agree that the proposal reject fee would ideally be low.  I’m sure we will get there some day after significant changes occur and I will be fully supportive.  I think we have a problem that needs to be dealt with now and I’m simply proposing we use the only mitigation tactic that is readily available today.  I don’t expect everyone to agree.

I also want to point out that the proposal reject fee is not a punishment for proposals that pass.  That fee is only retained by the NNS if a proposal is rejected.  In my opinion, higher proposal reject fees offer a new opportunity to incentivize a proposer to experiment with the NNS.  If they are willing to embrace the crowdfunding concept and they pursue their proposal for the right reasons, then they will be able to keep that proposal reject fee when the proposal passes since it is locked in their personal neuron.  I think it is an under recognized opportunity for experimentation and
incentives.

Maybe we should review why there was a 1 ICP rejection cost in the first place, it was designed to avoid spam proposals. It's a temporary solution by itself, the question it doesn't solve is should a normal proposal that doesn't go through deserve the same penalty as a spam/offensive proposal?I don't think it should be

Some of my proposals are obvious rubbish proposals, but I can add my point to a reasonable proposal, how should we differentiate?  So how to distinguish between spam/offensive proposals and low-quality/unreasonable proposals is the problem that should be solved.  (As for the spam proposal button, it seems to me that it is likely to be used maliciously, and it still does not prevent the broadcast of proposal content.)


Back to this temporary solution.  In my opinion 100ICP can’t stop me from launching proposal 79944, because in my opinion it is unbelievable for DFINITY employees to say "if don't trust a centralized company do leave IC", no country will admit that a  that must trust DFINITY‘s Web3.0/Metaverse.  Building a public chain with this concept is bound to fail. Building a public blockchain with this concept is deceiving me and the market.  So even before 79944, the proposal rejection cost has come to 100ICP, I will still initiate this garbage proposal, the difference is that I will write more opinions and nonsense.  Of course if the rejection cost was raised to 1000ICP I would shut up completely

I really enjoy your participation in this ecosystem @ysyms.  You are often very thought provoking.  Thanks for sharing your perspective.  

Now if I could just get some crowdfunding since we know your endpoint for titrating away the advertisement spam.  😂

Seriously though, I actually suspected 100ICP would not have discouraged you from 79944 since it was done out of a strong sense of frustration.  Everyone has a price they are willing to pay on principle and to be honest no proposal reject fee will stop spam for everyone all the time.  

My hope is that we can start using the proposal reject fee as intended and at least mitigate most spam proposals.  It may take more spam before that happens.  🤷🏻‍♂️

You make a good point that perhaps there should be a two tiered proposal reject fee.  A higher fee for true spam and a lower fee for proposals that are simply rejected.

At least 79944 is worth

MillionMiles | 2022-09-14 03:16:20 UTC | #86

The spam proposals for more reward submitted many times, so these caused 70015 raised, it's reasonable even i don't like it.

So far, 79944 is the only spam proposal for advertisement . I think we need waiting for more similar intended proposal submitted(maybe 3 times and above), then we can consider to make a mitigate spam proposal.

For Now, I don't think we need to do any mitigate solution but try to work out a permanent solution.

I agree personally. I think we should work/ focus on a permanent solution over a temp. fix. Especially, with how there is not much other spam coming elsewhere. I completely understand and agree it needs to be addressed however temporary solutions that muddy the waters aren't ideal. For that reason, I'm out of this particular proposal. 

I really appreciate and want to thank @ysyms for joining and giving actual input. However, I do want to argue that right now, as good of intentions as you may have, there *has* to be a better way. Personally, I understand what it is like to be this frustrated. However, we have to come up with a better solution than bullying (for a lack of a better way of saying it) our way into being heard. It will end up turning us into what we set out to destroy, and it ends up being less productive. Moving forward, you could use this clear talent and ingenuity to help come up with a permanent solution for something you're clearly very passionate about.

I agree with @coteclaude. This thread speaks to a lot of the toxic communication patterns between community members that *we all* need to seriously consider working on. Especially, with how @wpb was the placeholder for a lot of aggressive feelings that really are not directed at them. 

I know this has very little substance in a solution itself, but I just wanted to go on record and say that this is *also* what I speak to with how we communicate as a community with each other both internally and on your public feeds.

Last thoughts
I think moving the Governance Topics to Discord under the ICP option. This will Expose and Market the IC in a public forum that anyone can view but will need to purchase ICO from a coin reseller to be able to create a neuron for voting.

Personally I think it would be better off than in the Dfinity forum where you get accountants saying they can fix the voting with 1+1=3 this week and next 1+1=-3 and then there are the programmers who think the neurons owners should handover their investment on the NNS to pay programmers for further project builds while billions have already been paid to them. I, on the other hand, have invested into the NNS and way behind in a return.

If it goes 100icp or more, then every spam proposal will get an adopt vote from and every other will get a reject

It seems that we all agree on something:

as I understand this is what originated the spam proposal

[quote="MillionMiles, post:41, topic:15360"]
In order to avoid the impact of spam proposals on the majority of people, we only need to control the range of people whose spam proposals are displayed. For the majority of people, only proposals with a certain threshold of proposal approval rate (e.g. 10%) will be displayed by default in NNS, which will filter the probability of the majority of spam proposals being displayed without sacrificing the right of the general public to participate in the proposals.
Of course, if someone wants to see all proposals, they can simply lower this threshold to 0.
[/quote]

I’ve outlined this solution and provided source code changes here: 

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206

The. NNS dapp code may need to be different now but the code changes to implement this are trivial.

MillionMiles | 2022-09-14 11:51:54 UTC | #92

Thanks for your reminder. great to see your proposal :grinning:

Yes, I don't like any solution that suppresses proposals, we just need to control the reach of spam proposals!

IC is at a very early stage and what we need most now is public participation, not stifling ideas :fist:

wpb | 2022-09-17 22:58:08 UTC | #93

This proposal has been in deliberation for 7 days.  A prerequisite for moving forward with this proposal was crowdfunding.  Since no donations have been received, I am retracting this proposal and I have deleted the donation account information from the original post.  I will not be submitting this proposal to the NNS at this time.  I appreciate everyone who participated in the deliberation on this topic in a diplomatic and intellectually honest way.  Thank you.

coteclaude | 2022-09-18 01:21:56 UTC | #94

Now, have you asked yourself why people do not participate in the crowdfunding and why they may never participate?  May I give you some hint about it?
Everyone that have ICP lock in the NNS are investors.

First, with all the frequent and unpredictable changes to the NNS and rewards mechanics, it is very scary for investors now to buy more and lock ICP.  Personally, I do not buy and lock anymore ICP.  Smart investors don't invest in those such unstable system. Now I see how scary some proposals can be for investors.  I could have never predicted something like that.
Then, as an example, if someone have paid his ICP 50$ a year ago, the proposal for him would be 30 ICP x 50$ - 1500.00$.  Not the 30 icp x 6$ (180$) as it is now.
And something else.  Let say you really believe ICP will reach 100$ in a couple of years.  Paying 30 icp become a 3000 $ expense then.
The reason many people will not buy and stake ICP anymore is not because the price went down from 500$ to 6$.  it is because of the unstability of the system.
I know you see this as a system that need to evolve and change.
Many of us see it as if a system need that much of frequent and major changes, then it was badly designed at first and not ready to be deployed.
So, for all the reasons above,  I expect most to all crowfunding to fail and also a big barrier for more ICP to be locked.  The initial goal of 90% of circulation to be locked will never be reached.
If the system was stable, I would compound everyday.  Now, I take the rewards and sell.
I invite people thay have business experience to think about that.
There is nothing worst than having your money lock for 8 years and have all the rules changing so easily and so often.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-09-18 04:43:25 UTC | #95

I have to agree, with all the accountants and programmers constantly making the same changes over and over, don't see any results, I don't believe in them, I have decided to leave my compound grow till I see that it is time to take the rewards and run before I lose the lot. 

Nothing wrong with the project.

It seems spam is here to stay, rewards are not for investors, accountants to test theories that have failed, for programmers projects or inflation coupled with decreasing rewards for the future.

At this stage I'm not interested in the CF or SMS. 

But I do have more money to invest, not sure where.
