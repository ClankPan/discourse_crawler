I have a Cycle Wallet that previously showed two canisters which were linked to the wallet canister. On the web interface for the wallet, I no longer see them. I can still call them, and the canisters still function normally (e.g. responding to command line and serving assets). Is there a way to get them listed again on the web interface? It would be nice to see information about the cycles in the GUI.
