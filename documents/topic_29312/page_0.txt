> **bipQuantum introduction:**
> A groundbreaking protocol designed to revolutionize the way we mint, manage, and monetize intellectual property on the blockchain. Leveraging the power of ICP's advanced technology, bipQuantum offers a seamless bridge between traditional IP rights and the digital frontier. Join us in shaping the future of IP in the digital age.

**Abst:** 
This post introduces a forward-thinking approach to IP protection and tokenization on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) leveraging equivalent of ERC-721C standard we can name it bIP721X. We explore the integration of critical features such as on-chain plagiarism detection before minting assets and incorporating a KYC process for creators, all while ensuring data privacy.

**Technical Details:**

**1. ERC-721C* equivalent Standard:** Utilizes ICP's advanced blockchain infrastructure to create a robust framework for IP, emphasizing unique, secure tokenization of digital assets.
   
**2. Plagiarism Detection:** Before asset minting, an integrated AI-based mechanism scans for originality, ensuring authenticity and protecting against IP infringement.

**3. KYC Integration:** Implements a privacy-centric KYC for creators during tokenization, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to maintain anonymity while verifying identity and generating the blockchain intellectual property ownership certificate.

**4. Stable Storage & Certified Data:** Discusses handling canister upgrades with stable storage, crucial for preserving IP data, and emphasizes certified data for query calls, ensuring data integrity without compromising speed.

**5. Control & Asset Management:** Explains  bIP721Xâ€™s approach to asset control, including owner, operator, and custodian roles, providing a flexible governance model for IP assets.

**Conclusion:** The Bip-721X standard on ICP presents a comprehensive solution for digital IP protection, blending plagiarism detection, secure creator verification, and robust IP management. This standard not only meets the technical demands of modern IP management but also sets a precedent for future blockchain-based IP protection systems.

**Discussion:** We invite the developers, researchers and community to contribute insights, propose enhancements, and discuss the application of these principles in real-world scenarios. Your expertise can help refine this approach and evolve  bIP721X on the ICP ecosystem to become a leading platform for secure, transparent IP management and creation.
