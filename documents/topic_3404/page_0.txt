Hello everyone, I understand that a part of ethereum is responsible for developing the Web 3.0

I would like to open a space for debate and clarification to resolve doubts.
What differences and advantages does one have over the other?

Salu2.

PD: I understand the differences, but what is it really that will lead people to decide on one or the other?
