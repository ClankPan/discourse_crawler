As I‚Äôve been reflecting upon the NNS in abundance as of late, my attention has been drawn to the Neuron Fund, as I‚Äôve noticed many ‚Äúdesign flaws‚Äù and ‚Äúattack vectors‚Äù within it.

This proposal sets out with the objective & intent to signify the removal of the Neuron Fund, until solutions are thought out, discussed, proposed, and imposed, before reenacting the Fund. I am hopeful this will also inspire further conversation regarding the validity of these concerns, solutions, and the best path forward given the scenario we‚Äôve put ourselves in. 

The primary ‚ÄúAttack Vectors‚Äù, or, ‚ÄúDesign Flaws‚Äù, that I see within the Neuron Fund, are as follows, in no particular order;


1. Front-running
2. Liquidity Availability
3. Proportional Contribution
4. Tax Evasion
5. Portrayed as Investment Opportunity
6. Participants Inability to make Robust Decisions


Alone, each of these projects present formidable challenges, but the conglomerate create a major vulnerability for not only the SNS projects utilizing the framework, but the NNS itself.


The remainder of this proposal aims to address how exactly these attack vectors & design flaws are perceived as such, offering an in-depth explanation for each of the listed concerns.


**Front-running of Neuron Fund Selloffs**


Currently, when it comes time for the Neuron Fund to sell their allocation, it is done through a proposal.

Meaning; when the Neuron Fund participants have decided they‚Äôd like to sell their positions, they have to create a proposal, to the entirety of the NNS; which undergoes a 4 day voting period, assuming it does not pass with an absolute majority (has not happened aside from proposals DFINITY votes for).

With this being said, upon the proposal being submit to the NNS - the intentions of the Neuron Fund are immediately made transparent - and invite front-running over the 4 day voting period.

Front-running occurs when someone with prior knowledge of a transaction takes advantage of that information to execute their own transactions for personal gain. In the context of the Neuron Fund, individuals can exploit the transparency of the proposal to anticipate the actions of the fund and engage in front-running during the voting period.

As such, this inherently jeopardizes the Neuron Funds profitability & security - as it includes important information that must be accurate, to ensure the correct distribution of Maturity after a selloff.


**Lack of Liquidity for Neuron Fund Selloffs**

A crucial step in the Neuron Fund is the sell-off of acquired Assets.

This is currently done by market-selling to a DEX upon the successful execution of the NNS Proposal that enables the Neuron Fund to sell its treasury.

Something that isn‚Äôt considered within this model however, is that this scenario requires more liquidity to be within the DEX liquidity pool, or in order books, than input to the Treasury.

If we look at examples of past Neuron Fund Contributions, it can be denoted that ~333k ICP was contributed within Openchat‚Äôs SNS sale, while ~250k ICP was contributed within Kinic‚Äôs SNS Sale.

Contrast to the vast ICP contributions from the Neuron Fund, there is no liquidity pools for either of these tokens. 

Both are completely reliant on a supply & demand order-book based market maker.

$CHAT for example, has seen ~585k ICP Volume since its genesis, with only 6 of 17 weekly candles showcasing an influx of volume, rather than an outflow.

On the other hand, $KINIC has seen roughly ~3K ICP volume since Genesis, with both weekly candles showcasing an outflow of volume.

Alternatively, if we look at Liquidity Pool based DEXs within the network, it can be noted that there is a grand total of ~300k USD in liquidity.

With this being said, when the Neuron Fund does in fact go to sell its treasury, it will decimate liquidity through sheer slippage - as there is simply not enough liquidity to acquire such a position size in the manner the Neuron Fund has been designed. It may be stated that this isn‚Äôt a concern now, however, I‚Äôd disagree, as proactive measure needs to be taken before we put ourselves in an irreversible scenario.

This again, results in direct unprofitability to participants, and opens vulnerabilities within the SNS DAO being sold off, as a 51% attack on voting power become much more viable within this scenario, due to forced price action.


**Proportional Contributions by the Neuron Fund**

Currently, when the Neuron Fund Contributes to a sale, it allocates the entirety of the maximum allocation contribution to the sale the moment it‚Äôs generated.

This is flawed due to the fact that SNS Sales have a minimum, and maximum threshold - meaning the maximum threshold is assuming the absolute best case scenario.

As the Neuron Fund contributes in respect to the maximum allocation, rather than the minimum contribution, this creates a scenario in which, a proposal may not pass due to community contribution - but solely for the fact that the Neuron Fund contributed its maximum allocation, rather than its minimum.

This was showcased within Kinic‚Äôs decentralization sale, in which the Neuron Fund contributed 50% (~250k ICP) of the minimum contribution of 500k ICP, under the assumption the that the sale would reach its maximum contribution - to then only collect ~510k ICP total.

Meaning, if the Neuron Fund had contributed proportionately to the sale in respect to the minimum allocation, Kinic would have only only raised ~380k ICP, leaving them short ~120k ICP, in turn resulting in the failure to earn approval of an SNS DAO generation.

This again opens up vulnerabilities to Neuron Fund participants, and the general participants of the SNS Sale itself - as the minimum contribution threshold represents the final barrier & vote of confidence to successfully generate an SNS Sale.


**The Evasion of Taxable Events**

While it may not have been intended, this mechanism directly evades taxable events.

This is due to the fact that the Neuron Fund can only draw from liquid Maturity, that could be spawned, but instead is utilized under the guise of ‚ÄúMaturity‚Äù - which is conveniently not tracked within either Blockchain Explorer (ICScan or IC Dashboard), or the NNS itself. 

The lack of transparency presents two issues - being the inability gauge how much maturity was used in the sale, and how much is received from off-loading the position. Which in turn leaves all maturity to fall under the umbrella of a singular taxable event, being the spawning of staking rewards.

Utilizing the USA as the example jurisdiction (however, many jurisdictions apply similar laws), given the abundance of open court cases against DFINITY within the region, the following taxable events are directly evaded;

1. Spawning of ICP Rewards
2. Conversion of $ICP to Token
3. Spawning of rewards from SNS Tokens
4. Conversion from Token to ICP

I‚Äôd also be willing to make the arguement that Maturity Modulation only exists to avoid Switzerlands ‚ÄúWealth Tax‚Äù, but that is another topic.


**The Portrayal of an Investment Opportunity**

As of present, not only the SNS, but the Neuron Fund are presented as investment opportunities, within DFINITY-published documentation.

Given the SEC has been pursuing DFINITY & ICP regarding unregistered securities, promising any form of profit or investment on behalf of the work of others, should obviously be a red flag.

The screenshots below represent the state of documentation, of which can also be found in ‚ÄúResources‚Äù.

![IMG_9304|687x349](upload://MDB1oJIA2fEMs8dFCti5GQOk9R.jpeg)


**Participants Inability to make Robust Decisions**

Given Neuron Fund Proposals are voted on by the entirety of the NNS, rather than specifically the neurons who have contributed to the Neuron Fund - it creates a gatekeeping aspect, in which the entirety of the NNS gets to decide when an acceptable time for Neuron Fund participants get to offload there position, or participate in a sale.

This is inherently flawed, as the responsibility of the entirety of the treasury, is then entrusted within the hands of entities who, for lack of better words, may have ‚Äúno skin in the game‚Äù in regards to the Fund itself.  


**Concluding Thoughts**

In conclusion, to be quite frank, I think the best route here is simply removing the Neuron Fund, whether it is temporary or indefinitely, until valid solutions for all proposed consequences are imposed & enacted, but I‚Äôd love some feedback & other opinions.

Going to tag a few relevant parties to keep this conversation on track from the start this timeüôÉ

@bjoernek @diegop @lara

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-06-23 16:56:29 UTC | #3

I agree that documentation needs to be updated to remove the word "investment ",  while replacing it with words like acquiring utility tokens to participate in the project's governance.

-------------------------

caolw | 2023-06-24 00:56:39 UTC | #5

I don't agree with your statement that kinic has sent out votes every month, which is their labor success. It's hard for them to go out and play. Hope the community chives can provide more ICP for this kind of project. :face_vomiting:

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-06-24 09:03:11 UTC | #6

Many thanks for sharing your thoughts on the Neurons' Fund. I have the following feedback:

Regarding point 1 & 2 [Selling of tokens]: Agree. Details are not fully designed yet. Your concerns should be considered in design enhancements. Note: The Neurons' Fund currently doesn't dissolve any SNS neurons or sell any SNS tokens.

Regarding point 3 [Proportional Contribution]: Agree. A proposal is already tabled to address this, as detailed in this forum post [[link](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/suggested-enhancements-to-the-community-fund/20411)].

Regarding point 4 [Purpose of the fund]: Disagree. I would like to clarify that the purpose of the Neurons' Fund is to aid the bootstrapping of the SNS DAO ecosystem. As we can see from past and planned SNS launches, it played an important role for interested SNS projects in launching their SNSes. 

Regarding point 5 [Documentation]: Agree. The wording should be enhanced for clarity on the Fund's participatory nature. I will look into this next week. 

Regarding point 6 [Decision making]: Disagree. The design of Neurons' Fund allows flexibility in participation and decision-making. SNS projects can specify their participation preferences in the SNS proposal, and NNS neurons can opt out anytime.

Concluding, my view is the following: You highlighted several valid points which should be considered in subsequent refinements of the Neurons' Fund. Given its critical role in bootstrapping the SNS ecosystem, it's prudent to implement these enhancements step by step.

-------------------------

Ranotor97 | 2023-06-24 09:56:14 UTC | #7

Thank you for taking the time to answer. What are your thoughts on temporarily pausing the SNSs until the NF is fixed? From my perspective, it appears that each of them (Kinic, EMC, Hot) is receiving more than 50% of the funding from the NF, which seems economically unsound. Additionally, it is going to be unfair for the upcoming ones after the change (point 3) is applied.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-06-24 10:50:37 UTC | #8

Goodmorning @bjoernek 

I appreciate both your timely response and your opinions in regards to this matter, as it is to my understanding that you have essentially designed the Neuron Fund to date (there may be other parties involved, but this is how it appears from public facing documentation).

It seems as though we‚Äôre in general agreeance, however I just wanted to touch on a few of your points.


[quote="bjoernek, post:6, topic:20936"]

I‚Äôm not saying that the Fund purposefully went out of its way to avoid taxable events, but the fact of the matter is, it certainly does. 

While I recognize the assistance this fund has provided to achieving SNS DAOs minimum contributions - all ‚ÄúMaturity‚Äù utilized, is ‚ÄúMaturity‚Äù that *could* be spawned. 

Meaning there is no reason to group Maturity into the Neuron Fund, as it is already liquid, and could simply be spawned, and utilized in the form of ICP. 

Hence why I say, while it may not be intended, it does in fact directly evade taxable events.

Currently, there is ~20m ICP in the Neurons Fund. Let‚Äôs assume best case scenario, this equates to 40m VP - which is about 10% of VP. 

If Neuron Fund participants want to participate in a sale, or sell their positions, they have to *request* the other 400m VP allows them to. 

Therefor this does not allow them to robustly make decisions, as others are the ones making the decisions for them, whether it‚Äôs to use their funds, or allowing them to sell their position. 

While they can choose to simply opt out of the box, that does not allow you to suddenly manage the assets the Neuron Fund controls on behalf of you - you‚Äôre still at the mercy of the NNS.

My perspective is as follows: The Neurons' Fund, though it can and should be further improved, is already instrumental in supporting the SNS ecosystem. As such, it should remain available for interested SNS projects and participating NNS neurons. Concurrently, work on enhancements can proceed (such as matched funding) without interrupting its operation.

So in essence you believe the reward (being the ability to participate in SNS sales, with what could be liquid ICP, without having to spawn it & creating a taxable event) outweighs the risk (being the legal liability & vulnerability to the entirety of the NNS on multiple fronts, the insecurity of liquidity, over-inflated Neuron Fund contributions, and the fact that the Neuron Fund is essentially a ‚ÄúHoney Pot‚Äù)‚Ä¶?

True, however an ‚Äúemergency disburse‚Äù proposal was floated, and they didn‚Äôt like the thought of that.

So the alternative is simply not creating functionalities that put DAO participants at legal risk - or at least addressing design flaws when they‚Äôre raisedüôÇ

Good post! @Accumulating.icp 


However I would not waste my time reasoning with DFINITYs decisions in Forums since those who make the decisions barely use the forums. They are informed by the informants and moderators [ His Majesty‚Äôs Royal Guards ]


It would be a better use of your time if you could create a website like [cryptoleaks.info](https://www.cryptoleaks.info) and post these findings there. We would gladly help you in this process and contribute our resources.


We do not want law enforcers to come after us later while swiss based organizations enjoy the financial leniency by exploiting loop holes. So we share this sentiment with you.

It's quite disheartening to witness the number of changes required to serve Americans, given that their system tends to lean toward a sort of socialism for banks and institutions, adversely impacting the retail sector.

Fighting with options like Following other neurons or Neurons' Fund is taking for fools everyone who uses this option (because it's only optional, choose to use).
It's like banning the production of combustion cars in the EU by 2035, just because the climate is breaking down and people are "too stupid" to buy electric cars of their own free will (even though they aren't as green as their proponents say).

Anyway, on topic: changing the nomenclature from investments to providing utility tokens in exchange for temporary governance rights would be really good.

So where would OpenChat, Kinic and HotOrNot be without the Neurons fund?  I mean, I know Dragginz jumped the queue but we were still considering a SNS launch and the Neurons fund would have been a part of that

My only gripe is that it doesn't work with Ledger yet!

[/quote]

Considering the ICP used in the Neuron Fund is Liquid Maturity that could be spawned as ICP - if the participants of the Neuron Fund wanted to invest in the specific sales you‚Äôre referencing, they would simply spawn their maturity and participate in the sales.

Even if you assumed fund participants are completely passive, that still leaves these SNS projects with hundreds of thousands of ICP.

I understand the thought of millions of ICP in funding sounds lucrative to many, but we have to balance the risk vs reward - and I feel as though this makes the entirety of the NNS liable from a legal perspective (given jurisdictions have determined DAO participants are responsible for DAO actions).

Sure, if there wasn't a Neurons Fund they may have done that, but it's extra work especially for an air-gapped neuron.  Now they have the ability to "set and forget", and some have chosen that option.

As far as the legal part goes, IANAL but I know there are some amazing lawyers in Zurich who specialise in just that.

What is your experience of law in Switzerland? I mean being afraid of government is never a great way to live life. I know the US is hardcore authoritarian right now but these things come and go. NF is basically an ETF, you can choose to participate. No one is forcing anyone to participate. The honey pot is def there for early projects and I think participants of the NF will choose to leave once the projects don't perform to their expectations. Such is the life of investing though and ETF's that will go to zero exist in traditional markets. I mean makes sense to have an optional DFinity dApps ETF.

I am not saying it shouldn‚Äôt exist, I am saying in its current form, it presents the opportunity to do more harm than benefits offered. 

Your description of the NF ties very well into the ‚ÄúPortrayal of an Investment Opportunity‚Äù. However the difference in comparison to a traditional ETF, is that NF participants don‚Äôt get to choose when they exit, or if they even can at all - the NNS does. 

The legal aspect is 1/3 of the issue - even if we say ‚Äúthis is blockchain there are no borders this is a DAO they can‚Äôt sue us!‚Äù, there are still major vulnerabilities in regards to Front Running, Liquidity, Contributions, and Participants Decision making abilities.

My previous proposal has shown the forums are beyond censored - I would prefer something immutable. 

Furthermore, if you felt as though there was a functionality that posed a legal threat to the entirety of the NNS, or that there was a security risk on multiple levels to the SNS framework, would you not want documentation that you actively attempted to prevent it from taking place?

Controlling parties made their stance clear before I put this to prop, I knew how the vote would go, but I find it curious you‚Äôd like me to justify putting this to proposal, even though all governance proposals are just documentation of glorified polls.

Taxes on what? Maturity in itself has no specific value to be traded in the market.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-06-28 13:14:37 UTC | #46

The maturity is being exchanged for ICP within these sales. It has an active exchange rate. 

The SNS NF neuron then produces rewards, in most circumstances, if it is voting. 

The NF neuron is disbursed, sold back to ICP, and returned in the form of maturity.

Hence it directly goes out of its way to evade taxable events by disguising them as ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù. If you were to do this on an individual level, there‚Äôs 2-4 taxable events depending on the jurisdiction.

@Accumulating.icp 

I feel that all points of discussion regarding your proposal to remove the Neurons' Fund have been thoroughly covered in this forum thread. I appreciate that you have now submitted a motion proposal, allowing the NNS to make an informed decision and allowing us to move forward.

As I have previously explained [above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/neuron-fund-design-flaw-proposal/20936/6) in detail, I do not support your proposal. The Neurons‚Äô Fund plays a crucial role in bootstrapping the SNS ecosystem and, by extension, significantly benefits the entire IC. Consequently, I anticipate that DFINITY will reject this proposal.

I agree that there are aspects of the Neurons' Fund that can and should be improved. For instance, in response to concerns about proportional contribution, a concrete proposal has been put forth in this [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/suggested-enhancements-to-the-community-fund/20411) a month ago. I intend to submit a motion proposal related to this issue shortly.

Given it‚Äôs liquid maturity, that could be spawned, and is actively being utilized within the Neuron Fund, is it an accurate assumption to assume that because the Neuron Fund ceases to exist, the participants also are no longer interested in ‚Äúbootstrapping the ecosystem‚Äù?

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:10, topic:20936"]
So in essence you believe the reward (being the ability to participate in SNS sales, with what could be liquid ICP, without having to spawn it & creating a taxable event) outweighs the risk (being the legal liability & vulnerability to the entirety of the NNS on multiple fronts, the insecurity of liquidity, over-inflated Neuron Fund contributions, and the fact that the Neuron Fund is essentially a ‚ÄúHoney Pot‚Äù)‚Ä¶?

Whether it passes or fails as a proposal, I‚Äôm sure there are details of the NF that you have highlighted that will be improved in the future.

Hey @Accumulating.icp, as you know I'm still pretty new to ICP and am trying to gain a better understanding of the ecosystem and how it functions. There are some things in this proposal that I just don't understand and am hoping you, or anyone else, can clarify.

For the sake of this discussion, assume I am a small retail investor that has staked 100 ICP for 8 years and checked the "participate in neurons' fund" checkbox.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
Currently, when it comes time for the Neuron Fund to sell their allocation, it is done through a proposal.

Meaning; when the Neuron Fund participants have decided they‚Äôd like to sell their positions, they have to create a proposal, to the entirety of the NNS;
[/quote]

So if I have participated in any of the prior SNS sales by voting in favor of it by solely checking the "participate in neurons' fund" checkbox, if I want to sell my portion of that SNS, I have to do it through an NNS proposal? There is no other way?

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
Front-running occurs when someone with prior knowledge of a transaction takes advantage of that information to execute their own transactions for personal gain. In the context of the Neuron Fund, individuals can exploit the transparency of the proposal to anticipate the actions of the fund and engage in front-running during the voting period.
[/quote]

In what way could someone take advantage of that information? I'm not seeing a way in which that information is useful for anyone trying to do something malicious.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
A crucial step in the Neuron Fund is the sell-off of acquired Assets.

This is currently done by market-selling to a DEX upon the successful execution of the NNS Proposal that enables the Neuron Fund to sell its treasury.
[/quote]

Now I'm confused, because above that, you said "*Neuron Fund participants have decided they‚Äôd like to sell their positions, they have to create a proposal, to the entirety of the NNS.*" So, as a small investor under the circumstances I stated, can I just go to a DEX and sell what I got? Or do I have to create a proposal?

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
With this being said, when the Neuron Fund does in fact go to sell its treasury, it will decimate liquidity through sheer slippage - as there is simply not enough liquidity to acquire such a position size in the manner the Neuron Fund has been designed.
[/quote]

Is this based on the assumption the Neuron fund is going to just dump everything at once? I'm confused because, if I was a NF contributor, based on what I said above, I don't get to keep my portion? 

So far, this sounds like the Neuron Fund is just one huge entity that can go and dump its treasury of any token on any DEX it wants at will and decimate the liquidity pool. Is that really how it works? I'm honestly not sure if that's the case because I don't have enough experience with it. If that is the case, why would it do that? On top of killing the price, it would take a huge loss at the same time? I guess if the project it had invested in was in a death spiral?

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
While it may not have been intended, this mechanism directly evades taxable events.
[/quote]

I live in the U.S. and have for all of my life. I use cash. It can be used to directly evade taxable events. That doesn't mean it is a bad tool. It just puts the burden of tax reporting on me. Just because the mechanism doesn't take into account taxes (which it shouldn't, in my opinion), doesn't mean it's a flaw.

It is my belief each individual is responsible for keeping track of their own taxable events and correctly reporting them to whatever agency oversees that in their specific country. In the U.S., if I sell someone something, I am supposed to collect taxes based on where I live because I am going to be expected to pay those taxes at the end of the year. I worked as a freelancer for a while, and I knew when someone paid me, I needed to set aside some of that money for taxes. If ICP moons, I am going to have to pay taxes on that. That's my responsibility.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
Which in turn leaves all maturity to fall under the umbrella of a singular taxable event, being the spawning of staking rewards.
[/quote]

I am not a lawyer, or tax professional, but this sounds reasonable to me. And I would put the burden of paying for that taxable event on the person/company that received those rewards. If that's me because I participated by having that box checked, then I need to handle it. Or hire a professional to handle it for me.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
Utilizing the USA as the example jurisdiction (however, many jurisdictions apply similar laws), given the abundance of open court cases against DFINITY within the region
[/quote]

I think this is unfair. How many court cases are open against Dfinity in the U.S.? I have only come across one Civil case. Just because the SEC filed a court case against another entity and stated they believe ICP is a security doesn't mean they have an open case against them. They may, or they may not. Can you send me a few of the cases so I can read through them? I actually like reading through legal proceedings because they often have very useful information.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
Given the SEC has been pursuing DFINITY & ICP regarding unregistered securities, promising any form of profit or investment on behalf of the work of others, should obviously be a red flag.
[/quote]

Again, I think this is not an accurate statement unless Dfinity has been issued a Wells notice, or the SEC has filed an active case accusing ICP of being a security. I haven't seen this yet, but if they have, please send me the cases as I'd like to check them out!

With that said, I think it's sad that a company should have to base their documentation on the constantly fluctuating laws in the U.S. I don't think that's right. I would hope someone has read through their documentation and determined it was good enough to outline the opportunities along with the risk. I think the language is fine, but I'm also not going to cry to the SEC if my investment tanks. I know the risks.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
Given Neuron Fund Proposals are voted on by the entirety of the NNS, rather than specifically the neurons who have contributed to the Neuron Fund - it creates a gatekeeping aspect, in which the entirety of the NNS gets to decide when an acceptable time for Neuron Fund participants get to offload there position, or participate in a sale.

This is inherently flawed, as the responsibility of the entirety of the treasury, is then entrusted within the hands of entities who, for lack of better words, may have ‚Äúno skin in the game‚Äù in regards to the Fund itself.
[/quote]

Can you explain how this is the case a little better? I'm totally confused as to how the Neuron Fund works after a successful SNS swap now.

[/quote]

That is correct, but the NNS proposal does not signify that you individually want to sell - it signifies that the entirety of the Neuron Fund wants to sell. 

The issue is that it groups the entirety of the ‚Äúfund‚Äù under one umbrella - in which they make one collective decision on behalf of all involved. 

Except it‚Äôs not the fund that makes the decision, it‚Äôs liquid democracy representatives of the NNS.  


[quote="jwarner, post:54, topic:20936"]

[/quote]

This scenario creates 2 issues,

Primarily, assume you‚Äôre an investor in an SNS, and you learn that the Neuron Fund would like to their allocation of the supppy (typically 10-20% of supply).

Knowing that will reduce the price of the token, you can take your tokens ahead of time, front run the proposal, sell off before the fund, and purchase after the fund is done selling, at a drastically discounted rate.

That event creates a scenario in which the selloff price for the fund is inaccurate, therefor the distributed maturity does not align with ICP received from sale.

 
[quote="jwarner, post:54, topic:20936"]

[/quote]

No, you can not simply go to a DEX. 

If your ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù is locked within the Neuron Fund, you need the Neuron Funds permission to dissolve & sell off these assets.

You do not hold the assets, the neuron fund holds them for you.


[quote="jwarner, post:54, topic:20936"]

It is true that the Neuron Fund could compartmentalize into smaller transactions, but currently, the Neuron Fund identifies the entirety of the an SNS sale as a ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù. When a proposal is made to dissolve Neuron Fund SNS Neurons, it currently does not specify which neurons, but rather addresses the SNS as a conglomerate. 

The individual does not directly control their assets.

The difference here is that when you go take cash out of your ATM, there is a trail that can be followed.

When maturity is withdrawn from neurons - there is no trail. When SNS rewards are compounded, spawned, sold - there is no trail.

While I agree that typically the responsibility would fall upon the individual - there literally is no way to track the countless taxable events evaded. You do not have access to most of the information required.

This ties back into a few of your first questions, but essentially, if you are a neuron fund participant - anything you want to do with your portion of the fund (in reality actions can only be made with the entirety of the fund), you need approval from the entirety of the NNS to do so.

Proposals to participate, disburse, and sell, all go through the NNS.

The gatekeeping aspect is the fact that 445m Voting Power is controlling 20m ICP worth of assets on behalf of others - rather than simply allowing people to manage their own assets.

You're assuming I'm using a bank at all. If I charge someone $5000 to paint their house, and they pay me all in cash, that's a taxable event. I, being the receiver of the cash, am supposed to report that as income when I file my taxes. Without a contract, the government will never know or can prove the transaction ever took place if I never deposit that cash in a bank. They cannot track that money if I keep it in cash. For me, this is not a reason to shut down the NF.

I still don't see a problem with there being no trail. I'm responsible for tracking my transactions/gains/losses. If I have access to the money entering/leaving my wallet, I have access to the information required to report it. It may not be EASY to track, but I can definitely keep track of my own stuff if needed. If I don't/can't, again, that's on me as a user. I'm not arguing this shouldn't be a feature.

To me, and to the courts in the U.S., it doesn't matter what they believe. It matters what they can prove.  Building a case is VERY different from filing a case.

I should have said that before. Yes, based on that filing, they obviously are looking at ICP as an unregistered security, but with all of the uncertainty in the U.S. crypto markets and debating in Congress, it doesn't bother me at all. 

 So there is only one active Civil case from private parties against Dfinity in the U.S., that I know of.

I wanted to point out that ‚ÄúSmaug‚Äôs Neuron For Retail Investors‚Äù voted Yes in favor to remove the Neuron Fund. 

For one the name is very misleading to retail investors and should be considered ‚Äúfalse and misleading‚Äù and this neuron needs to be removed.   

Removing the Community Fund would put many retail investors who want to swap their ICP for a project tokens in taxable situations, hurting the retail investor. 

I think someone there should be a proposal to remove that Named Neuron until a more appropriate and non-misleading name can be brought forward. 

It‚Äôs misleading and false advertising and I perceive it to hurt ICP retail investors. 

From an investor opinion the name is Misleading and must be changed‚Ä¶ you shouldn‚Äôt vote to put a retail investor into a taxable situation,  when your name suggests your ‚Äúfor the retail investor‚Äù. If I were the SEC (whom is supposed to be looking out for retail‚Äôs interests) I might want to question the owner of that neuron to see if they really do represent the retail investor.

Edit: Sidebar: I love the SNS, why can‚Äôt other SNS project‚Äôs tokens that have launched (SNS1, CHAT, KINIC) be used for current SNS token swaps. Currently it‚Äôs only ICP that can be swapped for HOT (Hot or Not) tokens, why can‚Äôt I use other other SNS tokens. This would strengthen the community in my opinion - I‚Äôm not sure if this was brought up or discussed previously but I think this should happen in the future unless there is some technical factor that would prohibit it. ‚ÄúLive together, die alone‚Äù

How can I take my tokens ahead of time? I thought if I wanted to sell them, I couldn‚Äôt, they are all under one umbrella and it has to go through the NNS? I‚Äôm clearly not getting this concept. It sounds like you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm forced to hold my portion unless a proposal is passed and everything is sold at once, but if I want to front run, I can just sell my portion ahead of time. It can‚Äôt be both, right? What am I missing?

There is a difference between the SNS and the Neuron Fund. You can participate in SNS sales without participating in the Neuron Fund (as an individual). 

They and anybody else with a token allocation, are the ones in a position to front-run.

You‚Äôre assuming I‚Äôm using a bank at all. If I charge someone $5000 to paint their house, and they pay me all in cash, that‚Äôs a taxable event. I, being the receiver of the cash, am supposed to report that as income when I file my taxes. Without a contract, the government will never know or can prove the transaction ever took place if I never deposit that cash in a bank. They cannot track that money if I keep it in cash. For me, this is not a reason to shut down the NF.

How do you determine your average buy in, your staking rewards, your sell off point, the quantity of tokens you get, etc, if you do not have access to the information regarding the maturity utilization, the neuron, the staking rewards, etc? Then how do you seperate that event from governance rewards, and SNS payouts?

This should not be a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moment for users - they should not have to write their maturity down on a pen&paper on a daily basis to track their ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù. Let‚Äôs keep in mind people are saying the Neuron Fund needs to exist so that people can use a ‚Äúset&forget‚Äù mindset.

Otherwise they would simply spawn their maturity, and participate in the sale manually.

Removing the Community Fund would put many retail investors who want to swap their ICP for a project tokens in taxable situations, hurting the retail investor.

For tax reporting purposes, in short, my tax guy needs to know how much I made and how much I lost on crypto. Based on that, he determines how much I have to pay to the government. I believe I can do that with what is currently available.

I don‚Äôt believe following the rules is tax evasion. One might call this a loophole, for a comparative example my investment property in the USA sold for $20,000 more than I bought it for - do I have to pay taxes on it?‚Ä¶. Yes if I take that cash and put it in my wallet‚Ä¶. No if I take that cash and buy another investment property. [(1031 Exchanges)](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0110/10-things-to-know-about-1031-exchanges.aspx) It‚Äôs a similar situation to the Neuron Fund - smart people following the tax code. 
The ones who win know the rules and know what‚Äôs allowed - the community fund isn‚Äôt tax evasion. 

What is clear is a misrepresentation of voting interests by leading ‚Äú‚Ä¶for the retail investor‚Äù into a taxable situation.

Maybe to you, following the rules is tax evasion

A mechanism was *crafted* in which people can take an asset that was received as staking income, exchange it for another asset, collect staking income on that asset, and then exchange back to the original asset, with the assumption of profit, without facing any taxable events - this is not equivalent to selling a house in a regulated market. 

We‚Äôll have to agree to disagree.

In this scenario, $TOKEN is ICP, and $stTOKEN is Maturity - $stTOKEN is a native token to $TOKEN.

The situation changes when you start investing $stTOKEN into $rtTOKEN, collecting a yield on $rtTOKEN, then converting back to $stTOKEN, under the guise of a singular event - being the distribution of staking rewards.

wpb | 2023-06-28 22:30:54 UTC | #71

Hey @Accumulating.icp the discussion between you and @jwarner is interesting.  So far I‚Äôm resonating more with most of the points James is making.  This is especially in regards to expecting people to take personal responsibility for understanding their decisions to participate in the SNS token swap, whether by direct purchase or through the neuron fund, as well as the need to take personal responsibility for compliance with local government requirements and taxes.  

I do think the SNS and the neuron fund is complicated and what would be very helpful is for there to exist a curated website that fully explains how it works and what people should consider when they decide to participate.  The DOYR that each person should conduct should be easier than sifting through many forum threads.

Personally, I live in the US and cannot participate in the direct SNS token swap due to geo blocking, which doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.  I make no attempt to circumvent it.  However, I don‚Äôt think the SNS token swap and the neuron fund should be designed solely around US laws when the goal is accessibility to a global audience.  I think geo blocking is an acceptable solution at this point in time.  The neuron fund can certainly be improved and I‚Äôm glad to hear @bjoernek highlight that Dfinity already recognizes these opportunities.

@accumulating.icp would you please clarify further why you think the neuron fund would fully exit participation in a SNS all at once?  I know it is possible, but I don‚Äôt recall seeing anyone post anywhere that this is likely.  It seems more plausible that the NNS would agree to an exit of the neuron fund in stages.  I‚Äôm actually curious if there will be some SNS where the neuron fund never exits.  I‚Äôve never given this much thought, but when you look through a governance and a decentralization lens, instead of an investment lens, then this seems plausible.

@accumulating.icp you made the comment that registered known neurons are the decision makers of the NNS.  I disagree with this claim.  The decision makers are the individual owners of neurons.  Owners decide who to follow and when to vote manually.  It is the personal responsibility of every neuron owner to make their own decisions how to vote on every proposal.  They can follow a known neuron, but it is still their decision.  Known neurons cannot accept or decline followers and they don‚Äôt profit in any way from the votes of those follower neurons.  The only people in control of their decisions are the neuron owners.

Hence it directly goes out of its way to evade taxable events by disguising them as ‚Äúmaturity‚Äù. If you were to do this on an individual level, there‚Äôs 2-4 taxable events depending on the jurisdiction.
[/quote]

It's pretty hard to invest thru the Neuron fund. You will need a million $ in ICP staked for 8 years for long while so you can buy tokens from an SNS for ~10k$. That is why it is beneficial for an SNS to separate a chunk of its tokens for those who are investing in the whole ecosystem in the long run.

A smart contract isn't trying to evade taxable events. It's up to you & your accountant to calculate your taxes properly. If you think investing thru NF should be considered 4 taxable events in your country, then file them as such and pay their taxes.

Not sure where you are going with this. NF has just started, it will get better. There are problems and attack vectors, but these will get fixed.

**Lack of Liquidity for Neuron Fund Selloffs**

A crucial step in the Neuron Fund is the sell-off of acquired Assets.

This is currently done by market-selling to a DEX upon the successful execution of the NNS Proposal that enables the Neuron Fund to sell its treasury.
[/quote]

The NNS doesn't have to do a market order, a limit order that sells the tokens at a specific price will avoid front running. ICPSwap and ICDex support these.
I doubt NNS will bother selling a few tokens and emptying liquidity pools, it's not economically beneficial for the 8y neurons.

Im not saying it necessarily *would* happen all at once, but it definitely *could* happen, as you‚Äôve acknowledged. 

The Neuron Fund receives a basket of neurons with various dissolve delays, however that does not change the fact that these ‚Äútranches‚Äù of dissolve delays still have immense volume behind them.  

Proposals are to dissolve, disburse, participate, with the entirety of the fund, inherently resulting in drastic volume. 

Furthermore, should the entirety of the NNS be making decisions on behalf of 10% of peoples ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù (ability to participate, disburse, sell)?

Ok, so let‚Äôs use your example and assume the average investor earns 3 ICP per day.  This is the current voting reward if the average investor has approx 6000 ICP locked in a neuron with an 8 year dissolve delay and votes on every proposal. In this scenario, it takes the average investor 0.5 year to accumulate 550 maturity.  

Now let‚Äôs assume there are 200 average investors who are willing to contribute all of their maturity to the neuron fund.  That amounts to 110k maturity from average investors, all of which took 0.5 year to accumulate.

It‚Äôs based on simple math that includes assumptions such as those presented above. The neuron fund is only funded from maturity, which is a time based accumulation.

I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre trying to go with this (I don‚Äôt see how this absolves any of the issues), but 6 Months in comparison to our 8 Year lockup period doesn‚Äôt seem that long to me. This is also negligent of the fact that, based off neuron IDs, there are hundreds of thousands of neurons that have existed. 

You‚Äôre making generalized assumptions of the entirety of the NNS in an attempt to prove your point without information to back the claim - you have no way to know the size of neurons, the number of participants, time staked, etc. 

Furthermore, time to accrue maturity does have a part to play in it, but you‚Äôre again extrapolating with information you don‚Äôt have. It would take a neuron with 100 ICP 1 Day to accrue .068 Maturity (rough numbers), however 10 neurons with 10 ICP would accrue the same maturity within the same timeframe - you have absolutely no way to gauge which of these scenarios occurs other than assuming.

I don't want to draw too many conclusions, but the jagged nature of these graphs certainly do not look like a bunch of small investors making distributed and decentralized decisions.

That‚Äôs fair to point out, these graphs definitely show that there are a few large neurons in there - and I‚Äôm not trying to imply there isn‚Äôt. 

However, I am saying that we have no transparent way to gauge which is which, without making assumptions (similar to followee voting power currently).

We should not be making assumptions in regards to the amendment of security risks & design flaws, taxable events, and other regulatory issues.

In hindsight I‚Äôm rather confused as to where this general talking point was intended to go in the first place - I‚Äôm not sure why the position size of participants, or how long it takes them to accrue maturity would be relevant within the context of front running, liquidity availability, proportional contribution, tax evasion, the portrayal of an investment opportunity, or the inability to robustly manage personal assets.

Concerning Governance Poll 123269 - (#NeruonFund) put forward by @accumulatingicp  After surveying the dev board we have received only adopt or abstain responses. ICDevs will vote to adopt with the understanding that this is a motion poll without any governance authority or action demanded. This is an opportunity for discussion, optimization, and organic adaptation which should be expected as we build these systems.

Statement of fact without commentary: Our board is made up of some of the highest contributors and most time-invested members of the community who all are pursuing building applications that may be DAOified and need to do fundraising one day. We could not find a single vote that wanted to affirm the Neuron Fund in its current form.

Commentary: The fund currently seems to be operating in a ham-fisted manner. The all-or-nothing nature of contributions to SNS sales is odd and oversight by the NNS in general seems counterintuitive to DAO philosophy where those with skin in the game make decisions. It is generally felt that the presence of the community fund is creating a race to capture the earned maturity leading to a lack of quality and thoughtfulness of projects pursuing SNS launches. We offer the following gradient of solutions from most drastic to least drastic, non-exclusive:

1. Fork by awarding all ICP-based neurons a mirror amount of sICP(balance + maturity) in an sICP SNS. This DAO can take over SNS-based votes and be given authority over the SNS Subnet, WASM oversight, and awarding of NF. This would allow ICP holders and organizations like ICDEVs that do not want SNS oversight to sell their sICP to those that do want this responsibility. This increases the alignment of those wanting to focus on governance with the Neuron Fund. The utility of this DAO is its oversight and filtering of wheat from the chaff.

2. Make the Neuron fund awarding a separate vote. Only let NF Members vote on awarding it.

3. Make the Neuron Fund contribution proportional to the fulfillment of the SNS sale goals.

Given DFINITY has voted ‚Äùno‚Äù, yet has recognized the abundance of design flaws within the Neuron Fund, does DFINITY have a plan & timeline to amend the following attack vectors, or will these be left to be exploited, @bjoernek ?

1.  Front-running
2. Liquidity Availability
3. Proportional Contribution (timeline?)
4. Tax Evasion (yes, i know it‚Äôs a feature, not a design flaw, but transparency is required for those who would like to accurately report their taxes)
5. Portrayal as an Investment Opportunity
6. Inability to make Robust Decisions

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:10, topic:20936"]
So in essence you believe the reward (being the ability to participate in SNS sales, with what could be liquid ICP, without having to spawn it & creating a taxable event) outweighs the risk (being the legal liability & vulnerability to the entirety of the NNS on multiple fronts, the insecurity of liquidity, over-inflated Neuron Fund contributions, and the fact that the Neuron Fund is essentially a ‚ÄúHoney Pot‚Äù)‚Ä¶?

This is so ironic given that your off topic comment, which was moderated due to violation of forum rules, was an attempt to censor.  LOL.

Hasn‚Äôt DFINITY already provided this feedback earlier in this forum topic?

[quote="bjoernek, post:6, topic:20936"]
Regarding point 1 & 2 [Selling of tokens]: Agree. Details are not fully designed yet. Your concerns should be considered in design enhancements. Note: The Neurons‚Äô Fund currently doesn‚Äôt dissolve any SNS neurons or sell any SNS tokens.

Regarding point 3 [Proportional Contribution]: Agree. A proposal is already tabled to address this, as detailed in this forum post [[link ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/suggested-enhancements-to-the-community-fund/20411)].

Regarding point 4 [Purpose of the fund]: Disagree. I would like to clarify that the purpose of the Neurons‚Äô Fund is to aid the bootstrapping of the SNS DAO ecosystem. As we can see from past and planned SNS launches, it played an important role for interested SNS projects in launching their SNSes.

Regarding point 5 [Documentation]: Agree. The wording should be enhanced for clarity on the Fund‚Äôs participatory nature. I will look into this next week.

Regarding point 6 [Decision making]: Disagree. The design of Neurons‚Äô Fund allows flexibility in participation and decision-making. SNS projects can specify their participation preferences in the SNS proposal, and NNS neurons can opt out anytime.

Concluding, my view is the following: You highlighted several valid points which should be considered in subsequent refinements of the Neurons‚Äô Fund. Given its critical role in bootstrapping the SNS ecosystem, it‚Äôs prudent to implement these enhancements step by step.

It was my intension to vote on your proposals but as a follower that decision was made for me and I was too late.

Accumulating.icp | 2023-07-04 10:01:07 UTC | #103

Based on the lack of response, does this imply that DFINITY does not have a plan & timeline in place to see these absolved, @bjoernek ?

alejandrade | 2023-09-09 16:10:47 UTC | #104

Probably a good idea to start looking into refreshing the SNS. Since in the current model people are already having trouble raising money and investors are starting to notice issues.

Do we really want to wait until everyone think it‚Äôs a failure and fixing it is basically impossible because all trust is lost?
