Good Morning, I am having a bit of a block with an application that I'm developing using rust in as the back end. What I basically want to do is create an API in IC that gets called from a local CLI application. After getting the back end rust canisters up and running and responding correctly to the calls I kinda hit a wall. Creating the API frontend. All I need the frontend to do is serve the request from the CLI with data that is retrieved from the canisters using @dfinity/Agent, Is there an example that I have missed in my searching or is there a better way to do this that I have overlooked? Thank you in advance for any answers or suggestions.
