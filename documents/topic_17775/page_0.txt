When I run `dfx nns install`, where does `dfx` save the list of canister ids that have been deployed locally?

The canister IDs are specified in this file: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/canister_ids.json

Moreover, they're also produced by `dfx nns install` at the end of the output:
```

Thanks for the answer, that helps but not entirely.

The goal is to make the build process (webpack, vite etc.) of any developers' dapps - that would have use `dfx nns install` - read and load these canister IDs.

e.g. with webpack, the developer should be able to use `process.env.LEDGER_CANISTER_ID` in his/her javascript fontend code.

So, that's why I am asking where this list of canister ids is deployed and save locally - i.e. in which local file?

Otherwise, if I get you right, it means that the IDs should either be hardcoded or the build process should download through Http the [ic/canister_ids.json](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/canister_ids.json) before reading these.

The NNS canister IDs are fixed and thus could be hardcoded.

Ok so either hardcoded or download and interpret that [ic/canister_ids.json](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/canister_ids.json) file but, I understand there is no local file to query. Thank you for the confirmation.

if you do `dfx nns import` you'll get the canister IDs into your dfx.json, which you can then query with either `jq` or `dfx canister id <name>`

Thanks @Severin. I though about it too, good point but I should have add to my question that I tried to use `dfx nns install` only for simplicity reason to deploy locally a subset of those that are deployed.

e.g. using `nns install` just to deploy II, ledger and Cmc locally without caring about all the other canisters.

So in that sense, running `dfx nns import` and loading the config with all canisters would not 100% accurate but, agree that's an option too.
