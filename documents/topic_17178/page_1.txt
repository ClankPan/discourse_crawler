It would be nice if there were some sort of "proof of ingress" or "signed chain of calls" at the protocol layer that a service could use to find the originator and verify the chain of calls is expected.

I suppose these could get very long if you have circular awaits amongst canisters doing messaging.  Still...I can see many use cases for having access to this info.

I guess basically it would be cool to have access to the current call stack at the protocol level.

I think it is time to build some libraries to simplify this ping-pong match and abstract it from the user.  Adding it to the list for bounties.

I am not a developer but I have followed the thread. Do you think that this problem can be solved in a coherent way without seriously impairing security or network speed?
[/quote]

I don't know what a system level solution would take.

In the meantime, it might be possible to build a workaround in canister space without modifying the system by introducing a dedicated (trusted, non-upgradeable) canister whose job is to track "capabilities". Then callees would have to make an asynchronous inter-canister call to find out on which principal's behalf the current call is being made. This adds latency whereas a system-level solution could be faster. So the workaround does impair speed. But it's doable. Everyone would have to agree on what this dedicated "capabilities" canister is. But also everyone right now agrees on what the ICP ledger is and that doesn't seem to be a problem. So why not also agree on a capabilities canister.

In the end, Psychedelic changed their focus because they found it much easier to raise venture capital funding to develop a decentralized CDN (content distribution network) for accelerating access to Web3 content. That’s partly because what they are doing is a great idea, and I wish Harrison and his team all the luck in the world with that, and it’s also partly because traditional VCs are very heavily already invested in the Solana, Avalanche and NEAR ecosystems, for reasons of timing, and the kinds of attacks our ecosystem suffered at launch described by [https://CryptoLeaks.info ](https://CryptoLeaks.info), and they rightly see the Internet Computer and ICP as potential disruptor of those investments.

Won't their CDN also be useful/necessary for IC apps?

This is 1000% spot on. We also invested millions dollars in engineering/design/marketing resources into supporting the IC to build Earth Wallet as a solution to some of the problems we saw with IC user experience (from real experience launching multiple top 100 cryptocurrencies and a decade of experience in the space). We had incorrectly assumed that Dfinity would operate logically and invest in growing their community projects, and in turn, would help make Earth Wallet the Phantom wallet of the IC (and no Phantom wallet is not a conspiracy theory to destroy the IC, it's just a good product that users have a good experience with). Instead all of our requests just went in one ear and out the other, and we were forced fed Dfinity failures with everyone else.

I am not the least bit surprised at the response from Dfinity to this thread. **Once again**, the solution is not "we hear you and let's build together next time so this failure does not happen again", it is instead, "let's ignore what these inferior idiots in our community are saying because they don't know what's best for themselves, we need to **double down** on what us geniuses at Dfinity create in our echo chamber and launch People Parties ASAP!!!".

The problem is you can only force feed people what they don't want to eat for so long before they all leave to go eat somewhere more enjoyable. I hope Dfinity realizes this someday so that the community can actually grow.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-11 11:40:32 UTC | #134

Given the boundary node setup and the distributed nature of the IC, I'm not so sure that the IC can't turn into a pretty fantastic CDN itself.  It may take some incentive structure, but imagine adding a response header to your http_request response that asks the boundary nodes to distribute your content to be cached for X amount of time and they charge you some cycles for doing so.

The great thing about an IC that does this is that you'd have control over both static content and adaptive content from the same system.

This is not the same problem. The punk was an NFT launch, which has been over 100 times already. The SNS 1 launch was something new which meant to reveal issues before real projects start using the SNS. If the actions taken after icpunk launch is any indication, following SNS launches will be much better like it did after icpunk.  The UI/UX for the NNS is extremely important. The community has criticized the foundation a ton for not making the NNS user experience better. I was one of them who criticized them a lot. The NNS is probably the top place where new investors go to. So the user experience need to be up to par. 

It's  funny. As soon as things start getting better. You got a ton of people start posting bunch of negative crap.

What specifically do you think the foundation should have done? What is stopping you from building a phantom like wallet?

-------------------------

Goku | 2022-12-12 12:54:09 UTC | #153

It's because:
1. Our designers and engineers could easily make $500k a year in compensation doing the same work for any other blockchain protocol, or a big 5 tech company. In a bull market like the one we just had, these numbers are 2-10x higher.
2. Building on a completely new technology stack like ICP means you have to invent new libraries and tools because the infrastructure is no where near complete. Again you need top talent who is capable of debugging complex architectures with little-to-no documentation, and this becomes even harder if there is not a friendly open source culture.
3. Maybe 5 years ago a blockchain could get away with a wallet or onboarding experience that is akin to a hackathon project, but not now. Earth Wallet is pretty close to feature parity with [Phantom](https://cointelegraph.com/news/phantom-raises-9m-to-launch-multi-chain-crypto-wallet), [MetaMask](https://forkast.news/headlines/consensys-raises-200m-metamask-21m-monthly-active-users/) or other which have raised 10-100s of millions and has near feature parity with:
- ICP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, and easily many more chain support of NFTs, Tokens, dApp connections, send/recieve, import/export, wallet signatures, and NFT marketplace.
- iOS, Android, and Chrome support
- In app staking for Ethereum (we moved off IC in January, but would have added this)
- Biometric authentication
- Wallet Connect v2
- QR code scanning to send/receive
- Flexa integration and upcoming fiat on/off ramps to use it with merchants

This wallet was originally built specifically for the Internet Computer experience, which as you know, has many unique features. We had hoped to be able to highlight these to the rest of the crypto industry, but instead spent most of our interactions with Dfinity having to justify why they should honour a measly $25,000 grant (which was promised to us a year ago) from their supposed $200m community fund. I think the better question is, how can a blockchain have a [$223m 'community fund'](https://cointelegraph.com/news/223m-fund-for-internet-computer-builders-but-community-is-wary) and **NOT** have a good UX wallet nearly 2 years after launching?

NNS is about this page? https://nns.ic0.app
seems fine, it's fairly minimalistic. The fonts and padding/distance of all UI elements need correction but the page is not too bad for a simple web wallet. But yeah, in terms of brand, for newcomers, compare what "feeling" the Exodus wallet transmits for example, and what impression this page does ("12th grade finalist in CSS/HTML afterhours class", ikr :laughing: ). Looks like it's good for tech people, who know that the design doesn't matter for underlying stuff to work, but retail newcomers won't be impressed, I agree.

MarketFFS | 2022-12-17 15:13:54 UTC | #165

Q: What do you think of DFINITY Marketing?

A: I think it would be a great idea!

I’m a new member- since I cannot seem to post a thread of my own until I post a few times, I’ll paste this in a couple of threads until I can get my own.

After 18 months of pure frustration have built up, I had to write a post. I hope it will be considered with an open mind. My intention is not to disparage but to raise awareness of some issues as I see them and to finally speak my mind, even if it’s as anon.

Of course, it’s a bear market, and of course, it can be argued that we got ICPerped by FTX.

But forever playing the victim doesn’t allow for introspection and growth, and whether true or not, it doesn’t do us any good moving forward.

DFINITY has a vast funding reserve. Why isn’t any of it being spent effectively on marketing? Is there even any intention to market properly?

Has anyone heard of Fastblocks? Me neither.

All jokes aside, DFINITY spent a ton of money on this venture yet doesn’t market it. I have never seen Fastblocks articles shared anywhere. At the time of writing, the Twitter has a whopping 378 followers.

Today they published FIVE articles- that would be a minimum of $250 outlay for ZERO return. I counted 19 (might be more) articles published in the last week. That’s $3800 a month. With Editor/management salaries, who knows how much you’re talking? It’s not cheap, though. And it’s not efficient.

Why publish five articles in a day? I cannot see any sense in it. Even the world’s biggest fan wouldn’t read five articles in one day on a publication. Not to mention, it gets lost and bogged down in any social sharing. Where would you even start? Maybe that’s one of the reasons why it’s never shared.

What exactly does Dfinity Special Projects do other than provide us with photos of members grinning in the Headquarters in Palo Alto and Zurich, giving us snack updates? Even they don’t take their role seriously. I’ve seen a podcast once in a while (with no traction) I’m genuinely not trying to be facetious here- I have no idea what any of the team actually does. I see no content creation. Once in a while, a small ‘event’ perhaps, but if that’s all it amounts to, much better off putting the money into DFINITY booths at EXPOs to build networks and partnerships. At least something might come of that.

I shudder to think how much has been spent on these little ventures with all the flights, salaries, and not to mention beer and snacks 😊 As if that isn’t enough, individuals are then shilling their projects as an attempted little side earner. Wait, are you trying to teach me something about the IC or shilling your shitty JPEGs?

It all stinks of a High Society Club, and guess what? Most of us aren’t invited, especially retail.

If you think the photos of individually lording it up (rather than any proof of work) are insensitive, how about the obligatory monthly banquet photo, complete with champers, cake, and foie gras? They might as well be drinking the tears of retail and dining on broken dreams.

It screams of disconnect and not understanding the community ethos. People are hurting. NOBODY except seed is in profit. Seed investors will not carry the project forward. They have already dumped or are in the process of dumping their bags.

This insensitivity is carried further with the whole ‘clique’ vibe that DFINITY gives off.

The community is not stupid and has understood this. They feel excluded. Projects, too, except the lucky few that are clearly favored, not necessarily because of their competence, but because they are part of the clique.

Don’t even get me started on grants. The amount of waste I have seen being spunked on ‘metaverse’ NFT projects that, in reality, were junk rip-offs that amounted to nothing was insane. 25k for an Angry bird rip-off that never materialized is just one example amongst many. 

Another example was 50k for a ‘Youtuber’ with no followers who literally had some paper taped to the wall behind him with ‘like and subscribe’ scrawled on it made me wonder whether to laugh or give up (nothing against the guy, and good luck to him (50k gift seems like a great deal of luck)).

Some initial ideas, moving forward:

* Get rid of special projects and restructure it as ‘Project Support Team’ and allocate resources accordingly to projects after interviews- fuse this with grant allocations- this will also ensure KPIs are being met consistently.
* Purchase PR packages/YouTube Influencer videos when something of gravity needs to be disseminated. Stop being so stubborn. We need network effects.
* Speaking of network effects, why are there no attempts to coordinate marketing or create cross-chain partnerships?
* Why isn’t Dom’s Twitter more carefully vetted and professionalized? He literally went off on a ‘Solana Paid FUDDER,’ which was literally set up as a satire account (which was admittedly hilarious).
* Create a sense of community. Be more inclusive.
* Support projects with time and human capital. Don’t just throw money and hope it sticks.
* Clear up all this governance mess one way or another. Any time DFINITY trends, you know shit has gone down.
* Fastblocks needs total reorganization or, better still, dissolution where something better takes its place.
* A new marketing division needs to be created. Performance-related pay should be initiated and connected to KPIs. A cull of oxygen thieves ought to be conducted.
* DFINITY employees must agree not to market their own projects and to focus on the brand itself. They also ought to be impartial and promote official DFINITY-endorsed projects, only (Project Support team/grant recipients).

It's impossible to stop team members from working on side projects if they deliver in their role at IC whatever they're hired for, unless there's conflict of interest in their side project, so it's complicated request. Everyone likes to have a hobby, you can't restrict people like that. 
About grants, it's a good question, maybe those who got the grants, were promising to build larger projects and later didn't deliver, we can't blame Dfinity for that IMHO. But your feedback is constructive and detailed, thanks for taking the time to share :thinking: . I wonder what the teams thoughts on marketing/grants strategy are.

I think the evil grin in your profile pic makes it sound even snarkier. But that stuff is often pretty funny, so more power to you (you probably didn't see that coming).

Good points here.  If what we were to sum up the problems we saw which ultimately caused us to stop believing in IC as the logical next step to Bitcoin and Ethereum:

- A supposed 9-fig builders fund unable to to solve "grade 12 html/css" UX for newcomers.
- Technical hurdles being defined by Dfinity Foundation and not actual developers/users.
- Dfinity organization hierarchy / elitist culture of angel investors, venture capitalists, Dfinity employees, and other insiders, which is a clear contradiction of building a world computer for 8 billion people.

If I were to make a suggestion for roadmap in 2023 to solve these:
- Allocate resources to making the UX world class for *all of crypto* with a subtle touch of IC
- Invest more in growing a builder community (i.e EthGlobal, Solana Hacker Houses) and/or host a yearly conference to better identify and empower real merit over online trolls
- Create a roadmap to either dissolve Dfinity or make it possible for anyone in the world to join and contribute to a 100% open source codebase with proper incentives.
- An "egoless" leader and messaging from the top.

rifass | 2022-12-30 11:31:18 UTC | #180

I feel the same and I really think they are lying about what they actually done. 

I know ICPL and their website definitely doesn't worth 1 million. Same as this Goku guy, so he has 1 million for designer and developer spent but has no budget on marketing? Besides, I really don't think developing a wallet in crypto can cost 1 million, if so then it has to be some level product (which I don't think any product has that quality in IC)

-------------------------

rifass | 2022-12-30 11:57:12 UTC | #181

@lei  I know ICPL and they have talked to some projects I worked for, from my experience with them this is a very unprofessional team. 
They lied a lot about their event or their relationship with some crypto-institutions. And based on this thread, they clearly don't have a close relationship with foundation. It is very funny because they told our project in a totally different way. 

Same as Earth wallet here. @Goku you spent 1 million to develop your wallet and wants the foundation to do the marketing for you? They didn't provide 25K and you just stop developing? despite the fact that you don't have anyone running your twitter. 

Dfinity Foundation clearly has many problems but I think it's very unfair for projects like you to put all blames on them while clearly you guys didn't do a good job about developing your own team.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-12-30 14:27:25 UTC | #182

This thread should be archived as whatever points the original criticism raised have now turned into one-off rants for personal grievances that don't add more to the discussion. 

Decentralization is not easy. There's a very real problem with most implementations of decentralization: it doesn't work in a vacuum, yet many seem to magically believe it does. It's a function of the work people do to make it happen (which is one of its most resilient features). Dfinity has made a platform that gives developers a chance at a future where blockchain is not just the custodial instrument of incumbent tech and its financiers, which is itself a huge step towards a viable decentralized future. 

The grant program has produced a lot of genuine work--much of it open source, some of it turning a profit--even if a few opportunists did only as much work as necessary to complete the first payout and run. It is light years head of funding programs on other blockchains. 

Dfinity has a long ways to go but has come just as far. If you have problems with Dfinity or the IC for not doing x y or z, ask yourself: do you think Apple would have succeeded if they had started out specifically trying to build an iPhone first? Because that's very similar to what's actually going on: Dfinity has been busy working on the foundational functionality of its platform before focusing on creating examples of what will be possible with that functionality when it is more readily available. In the meantime many developers are already making such examples. 

(*Admittedly Apple is not the best example nowadays as far as their developer tax, closed app island, and sweat shop labor practices which honestly do live up to "thinking different" in any shape or form.)

I'm not saying there aren't problems or that there isn't areas where Dfinity couldn't do better, but simply complaining due to personal dissatisfaction is not helping this ecosystem at all. Why not figure out a better tokenization model that makes use of what's possible on the IC? Or better yet, develop it? Or organize a group to crowd source creating it? Even a canister hosted petition thread that could provide an alternative to the NNS would do so much more than another disgruntled, inflammatory reply.

All that source code is publically available and cycles are cheaper than ever.
