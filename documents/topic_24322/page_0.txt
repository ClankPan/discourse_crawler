Hey there. Every time I build my canisters, I get this kind of warning:
```
Checking for vulnerabilities in rust canisters.
    Fetching advisory database from `https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db.git`
warning: directory /home/alexander/.cargo/advisory-db is locked, waiting for up to 300 seconds for it to become available
```

5 minutes is quite a big timeout to wait every time, especially when you update canisters frequently. How do I lower it to something more meaningful, like 10 sec?

Thanks in advance!

It shouldn't be locked all the time. Do you have other processes running that may access the advisory-db? Or is it possible that the db was not released properly at some point?

Thanks for the reply!

I use turborepo to build stuff in my project. There are two subprojects, where canisters are built during this process. Turborepo tries to build them in parallel, which (as I think) is causing the problem.

I could make it build them sequentially, but it is kinda strange given that cargo is pretty much capable of parallel building.

I tried building it sequentially and I still get the error.
How do I check what's locking it constantly?

Maybe some VSCode extension?

Uh, just ran into this as well. I know it is not an IC specific issue but just checking to see if anyone has a trick to unlock the lock. 

I have:
- Closed everything
- Deleted the folder
- Restarted 

Still issue remains. Issue occurs on a tiny project that built just fine an hour ago.

So, I guess the issue is not with the repo, right? I might have cancelled a build in the middle of building, that might have caused it.

I figured this one out. At least in my case.

The problem is that when you run something like `dfx deploy` and then interrupt it (by hitting `ctrl+c` for example), then the lock file is created but not purged properly.

Go to `~/.cargo/advisory-db` and delete the `*.lock` file manually.
After that the problem should go away, until you interrupt the build process again.
