Hello,

I created an IC app and have users logging in using internet identity on my .raw and my non .raw domain. I did not setup [alternative origins](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/internet-identity/alternative-origins) at the start. I tried doing that now but that makes the users on non raw domain to lose access to their original account.

What is the best way to consolidate these users. 

Note: I store users principals on the backend.

On the IC level, I don't think you can consolidate principals. If you want to migrate those to the non .raw / alternative origins principals, you would have to implement a migration on your side. Just a spontaneous thought though.

Unfortunately, there is no way of consolidating principals.

As @peterparker said, the best way forward is to offer users a migration flow (i.e. have them sign in on raw *and* non-raw and associate both principals with the same account).

Going forward, if you ever change the URL under which your service is available, make sure to set up alternative origins _before_ doing the URL change.

Tagging @domwoe based on a conversation we had on the Dfinity Dev Office Hours regarding this.

@harshbaz can provide any other clarification/context if you have any questions :)
