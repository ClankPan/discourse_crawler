We are running into a Candid compatibility error when we use "dfx install". The issue does not occur when we run "dfx deploy".

1. Run the following command to upgrade the canister:

`dfx canister install --network=ic --wasm .dfx/local/canisters/auth_dev/auth_dev.wasm.gz --mode upgrade '--argument=(record { modclub_canister_id = xxxxxxxx; })' auth_dev`

2. Noticed the following warning message and prompt:


```
Upgrading code for canister auth_dev, with canister ID xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx

WARNING!

An error occurred during Candid interface compatibility check for canister 'auth_dev'.

Checking generated did file.

Do you want to proceed? yes/No

This prompt will never disappear even if we have selected "yes" in a previous run. This causes issues for us as it fails our CI pipeline.
```

@diegop Could you help us by tagging a Dfinity member that might know the solution?

Yup!

@chenyan any ideas?

The two did files you posted is actually fine. I manually run `didc check new.did old.did`, and didn't find any breaking changes.

The problem probably comes from the `--wasm` option, where you provided a gzipped wasm. This may prevent dfx from finding the right did file, thus reporting a spurious error. Ping @Severin to double check on the dfx side.

One workaround is to remove the `--wasm` option, and add `gzip: true` in `dfx.json`. Then dfx should perform the gzip for you.

Thanks @chenyan we will try this and report back

@chenyan We have tested with the gzip flag in dfx.json and we still receive the same error.

You mentioned `dfx deploy` works fine, right? With the gzip option, you can use `dfx deploy` instead.
