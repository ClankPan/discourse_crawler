Hello @Jesse. I'm sorry you're having this issue, we have already started rolling out a fix for this but you will need to clear local storage to make it work again on your device. Some instructions for Safari are shared here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/problems-with-the-service-worker-custom-domain/19086/12
But please take care with your Internet Identity keys as they can be cleared along with the local storage depending on how old you device/anchor is. Please make sure that your recovery phrase works before clearing your storage.
