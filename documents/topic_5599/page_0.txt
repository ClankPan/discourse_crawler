The notify function in Ledger requires that the from and to of the previous transaction in the block height is equal to the from and to of the transaction that calls notify now.

This is done for safety, but what I donâ€™t understand is why not put this check in the notify target canister? That way, you can get the same security and **more flexibility**.
