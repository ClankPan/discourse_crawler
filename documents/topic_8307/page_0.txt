There is such a problem as the work of an actor in Windows 11 browsers. In my main Ubuntu system, frontend normally communicates with IC canisters. But in Windows 11, the actor stopped initializing. I turned off all security firewall and antivirus, but the problem remained. It also runs Windows 10 correctly.
