**Short summary:** To drive forward the discussion on how we can improve governance, especially to prevent spam proposals, we propose how new design proposals can be evaluated. We provide a first evaluation of some of the designs proposed in the forum, and we propose a roadmap on how to proceed with this discussion.

### Background & goal

Caused by a number of submitted proposals that did not have any actionable content, there are flourishing discussions in the community on how to prevent such spam proposals. Often, these discussions go over and beyond the original spam issue and propose further improvements for other aspects of the voting process as well.

We are very happy to see how many interesting discussions were proposed and how many people actively participated in these discussions!

To evaluate different ideas and compare them with each other as well as with the current governance system, we think it is important to first define what goals the governance system should even achieve.

To this end, the aim of this post is to:

1. Propose a set of governance goals that can be used to assess proposed solution and compare them with each other
2. Summarize the different solutions against spam that have been proposed by the community and assess them against these goals
3. Propose a roadmap towards improving governance.

#### What we ask from you

We are looking for feedback for all three points! That is whether you think the proposed goals make sense, whether you agree with our initial assessment of the existing design proposals, and whether you think the proposed way forward is reasonable.

### Goals of the voting process

#### Why we propose goals

In order to discuss whether a proposed governance design is a good one, we first have to define and agree on what properties constitute a “good governance”.

Example: Imagine a governance system with a single trusted voter. If this voter never submits spam proposals, such a governance system would solve the spam problem. However, we can probably all agree that such a governance system would not be desirable to govern the Internet Computer as it is clearly not decentralized. Therefore, to fully understand whether a given governance design is desirable, it is important to consider all goals.

Such a set of goals will also allow us to compare different proposed designs. If a design A satisfies one goal more than another design B, A should be preferred to B. Of course, in practice, there will be many cases where design A achieves a certain goal better than B and another goal worse than B. In such cases, a list of defined goals is still helpful to make tradeoff decisions about which goals should be weighted more.

#### The goals that we propose

This is a list of goals that we propose to consider when evaluating governance designs and changes. These goals also influenced the current design of the NNS.

* **Decentralized & active**: The governance is decentralized. That is, the voting power is distributed over many, independent entities and there is not one single or a few entities that can decide by themselves how the Internet Computer evolves. Also, there is a broad and active community meaning that many participants regularly interact with the governance and there is a variety of active voters (known neurons).
* **Secure & available**: Malicious proposals, that would be against the interest of the majority, cannot bypass the voting process and be “voted through” by exploring limitations of the voting protocol. Moreover, the governance system is always available to take new proposals and process them.
* **Long-term thinking**: Voters are incentivised to vote in the long term interest of the Internet Computer.
* **Efficient & scalable**: The voting process remains practicable when the Internet Computer and its community increase in size over time. This includes ease of deployment (change is easy to program and test). Also, the voting process can be completed efficiently by voters. For example, it is efficient to identify worthy proposals and easy to vote. 
* **Reactive**: High priority proposals, for example urgent security patches, can be adopted and executed quickly.
* **Purposeful**: Proposals should not be misused/bogus. For example not
  * Skew rewards without meaningful proposals
  * Bad content, display bad/inappropriate content to users
* **Simple & accessible**: There is a low barrier for entry, meaning that users with limited commitment (small staked amounts, low dissolve delay) can propose new ideas and contribute to the discussion. The voters understand how the governance system works.


Of course we are very keen to also have a discussion on these goals and get input if we missed some important ones!

### Initial assessment of designs proposed in the forum

Three general solutions against spam proposals that have been discussed in the forum are periodic followee confirmation, adjustment of all voting reward weights to 1, and voting in stages. We have assessed the above goals for each of them. There are additional solutions under discussion by the community which we could jointly add to the assessment. 

We first present in an overview table how we assess the different goals in each of these proposed solutions compared to the current governance system.

We then give more details about how we arrived at these choices.

#### Overview assessment of proposed designs

![Screenshot 2022-05-09 at 18.46.40|681x500](upload://aeSOio70IKBXbZJhfp6cHi8G1Wo.png)




#### More details regarding the assessments of the different designs

##### Periodic confirmation of followees

* Decentralized & active: Improvement
  * Requires periodic confirmation of following and thus a more active interaction in the process.
* Reactive: Worsening.
  * Only approx 190mn active voting power currently on governance topics.
  * A periodic reconfirmation of neuron following would presumably (at least initially) result in a similar active voting power for other topics as well (out of a total voting power of 410mn).
  * Thus, even if all voters voted, we would have to wait for the end of the voting period which is a show-stopper for urgent updates (e.g. update of subnet)
  * We consider this as being one of the most important goals to keeping the IC secure and thus do not recommend to implement this solution without further enhancements
* Purposeful - no reward skew: Improvement
  * Removes the financial incentive to submit spam governance proposals.
  * Only works if default following for governance and non-governance will be set up identically.

@wpb, @Kyle_Langham: As you coordinated the discussion on periodic confirmation of followees, what are your thoughts on this assessment in particular on the point of reactivity. Has this already been covered in prior discussions ?

##### Reward weights back to 1

* Decentralized & active: Worsening
  * After introducing the weighting scheme, voting participation increased from approx. 10% to 40%. Reverting to the old set-up might reduce participation in voting on governance proposals.
* Purposeful - no reward skew: Improvement
  * Removes the financial incentive to submit spam governance proposals.

##### Voting in stages

* Secure: Improvement
  * Additional hurdle against malicious proposals.
* Efficient & scalable: Improvement.
  * Only proposals supported by a certain amount of voting power will be submitted to an overall vote. This prepares for a future with many more governance proposals.
  * Proposals are pre-screened before they reach the general audience. Thus the voting process becomes more efficient for the standard user.
* Purposeful no reward skew: neutral/slight improvement.
  * More effort is required to get to the overall vote. However, it only partially addresses this issue, as there is still a financial incentive to bring spam proposals to the general vote in order to collect governance rewards.
* Purposeful no bad content: Improvement.
  * Seems like a pragmatic way to not show inappropriate content as part of the overall vote.
* Simple & accessible: neutral/slightly negative.
  * Makes it more difficult to get proposals to an overall voting stage. However, in order to get a proposal passed eventually, you need to gather prior support in forums anyway. Thus, this is not really an extra barrier.
  * The voting process becomes more complex.

@lastmjs: As you recently proposed a solution for voting in stages, do you agree on the above assessment and do you have any additional comments? 

#### Roadmap and priorities

We would be happy if the lively discussion on this subject is continuing and look forward to also contribute in further evaluating proposed designs!

Before taking concrete actions we think it is also important to take a step back, systematically compare all discussed solutions with each other and think about whether we can combine other ideas to arrive at an even better design.

The NNS team is currently working heads down on the service nervous systems (SNSs), which we consider to be a key feature for the development of the ecosystem on the Internet Computer.

Therefore, we propose to include the work on spam proposals on the DFINITY roadmap but not prioritize it over the SNS work. This means that fully analyzing and implementing the spam proposal prevention cannot be addressed right away and will take more time.

We are looking forward to your inputs and suggestions on all of the above topics! Specifically, the discussion around spam proposal prevention will be led by @bjoernek.

I agree with your assessment of the highlighted goals as they apply to the [periodic confirmation of Followees proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) (although I would make different assessments of some of the other goals not mentioned)...

The Reactive goal is worsening as you have described, but only for the short term.  I think we will quickly move from 47% voter participation to 51% voting participation.  It took about 1 week to go from less than 10% to over 40% when proposal weights and reset of default following for Governance were implemented.  I believe this quick response from the community was assisted by the daily education proposals that were ongoing at the time of implementation, so word spread quickly.  Hence, I think communication is a quick and easy solution to this problem that will get us to the threshold we need for Absolute Majority voting on proposals that need quick response.  

I also think the minimum voting period for non governance proposals should be no more than 24 hours.  In fact, I see nothing wrong with shortening that if necessary to say 4 - 8 hours.  There are no public known neurons that offer a service to the community to vote independently on any topic other than Governance.  This service is not needed yet, so we all follow Dfinity anyway.  When Dfinity votes, so will everyone else.  Hence, we don't need the extra time (e.g. 4 days) that was originally requested for Governance proposals to also be applied to other topics.

One final solution that I think is reasonable is to clarify the definition of total voting power.  If a neuron is consistently not voting, then should it really be counted in the total voting power calculation?  It's not an issue right now because of default following, which permanently gives all non active votes to Dfinity for All Topics.  Most neurons will confirm their Followees if proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) is implemented, but anyone who doesn't is not participating in governance.  Since governance participation on the IC is defined by voting and not by staking, then should we really be counting neurons that never vote in that total voting power calculation?  I think this is a fair question.

I highly recommend you include the proposal linked below from @Jarred-Sauce in this assessment.  It was a late addition to the discussion, but I think it is a very simple and elegant solution that disincentives spam for advertisement and announcement (e.g. "bad content").  It penalizes the a spam proposer without penalizing a quality proposer and without penalizing the voter.  It does this in a way that is scalable, simple, accessible, efficient, and secure.

@bjoernek 

Might I suggest also looking at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-fix-governance-proposal-rewards-at-75-on-a-daily-basis/12417

I’m curious how you and @lara might judge this proposal on each of the criteria you’ve described, in terms of its goal to limit the financial incentive behind submitting spam proposals.

I think fixing governance proposal rewards would specifically work very well in tandem with the “Voting in stages” proposal suggested by @lastmjs, especially since that proposal solves the advertisement/visibility incentives behind spam proposals, but does not solve the financial incentives.

@bjoernek 

Regarding your statement on the Periodic Confirmation of Followees proposal

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:12801"]
We consider this as being one of the most important goals to keeping the IC secure and thus do not recommend to implement this solution without further enhancements
[/quote]

Why did DFINITY then not make this point known when the proposal was in deliberation as this seems to be a potential security issue? And why did they not vote against this proposal?

I think it makes a lot of sense to keep as much staked ICP voting as possible given the fact that keeping voting power locked up in the NNS and voting (whether that voting is passive or active) protects the IC from a large actor (say a foreign country or potential bad actor like a country or Facebook) from flash buying as much ICP as possible and passing a proposal to degrade the network (such as attacking the network with an improper exchange rate proposal or governance proposal).


<br/>

Also, reading your statement in the context that the given proposal has already passed - are you saying that as it stands now the DFINITY Foundation is against or has hesitations about implementing the Periodic Confirmation of Followees proposal?

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-05-09 00:09:18 UTC | #5

I would like to give feedback on my experience with voting. I do follow some of my voting power to others and also check several times a day to see if there are new proposals to vote on, not sure but I feel there a proposals that I have not voted on.

I would like to give 100% to voting and if a proposal is limited to 4 - 8 hours then I feel I am not giving or been given that choice. As the NNS cannot broadcast a new proposal to neurons owners would a timeframe for voting for proposals work in a world community. 

Do some proposals also end depending on the percent of the votes.

I feel that I not given  the ability to give100% voting as a new neuron owner.

Having information about the voting I have missed out on could help and motivate me to understand my misgivings and the motivation how to understand and vote better and therefor achieve the goals of a better participation rate.

 I am happy to reactivate my followers in a given period as at the moment this default system gives me the confidence that I will receive the rewards I am owed for my investment, time and belief in this project.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-05-09 00:27:56 UTC | #6

Would you please clarify what proposal topics you vote on manually other than Governance proposals?  How long do you need to vote on them?

There are a lot of Subnet Managements, System Canister Management, and Node Admin proposals that have been occurring lately.  As an example, there were approximately 40 Subnet Management proposals throughout the day last Friday.  Most of those are voted by Absolute Majority almost immediately when Dfinity votes, but I have noticed a few are not voted immediately.  Perhaps those are the proposals you have been voting manually.

I think periodic confirmation of followees is a useful building block to improve governance. And yes, given the identified issue, we should analyze and discuss how this issue can be addressed, also in conjunctions with other ideas discussed in the forums.

Thank you @wpb, I agree that education can and should be a part of the effort to enhance & improve governance. However, I think we should aim for having a solid majority for urgent updates, so that we can reach a conclusion quickly on urgent subnet updates in a variety of circumstances (just about 50% might be a bit tight).

Yes, this is a very good question! I also started to think about active voting power which might be a useful enhancement for the periodic followee confirmation. One drawback that I see: Active voting power is currently around 195mn, out which 90mn is DFINITY. So introducing active voting power now (say for all categories) would give DFINITY close to 50% (of the active voting power). So we would need to see how to encourage and increase active voting beforehand.

Kyle_Langham | 2022-05-09 13:04:50 UTC | #12

Hi @bjoernek and @lara,

Thanks for putting these thoughts down and sharing with the community.  I really appreciate the gift that is a mental framework for evaluating new ideas and proposals.  I agree with the 9 design objectives, with the very minor caveat that Efficiency should also include the ease of deployment (ie, is the change easy to program and test).

I also agree with your evaluation of Periodic Confirmation of Followees.  I'll add that the affect on the design objective of Reactive will decrease over time as voting power skews towards active participants from the natural course of staking.  This is caused by two trends: new stakers on the NNS tend to be voting participants and neurons dissolving to less than 6-months tend to be skewed towards non-voting participants.  It could be that over the next few months a stronger absolute majority of participants is formed.

In terms of prioritization, I fully agree with prioritizing the SNS development and deployment over measures to reduce spam.  I also invite the community to think of ways in which we can reduce the spam in the meantime while also: 1) not diverting resources from SNS development, 2) skewing rewards back towards non-active participants (this is said not out of greed or fairness, but rather because I'm highly doubtful that any such proposal would pass) and 3) is acceptable given the 9 design objectives above.

Thanks for the feedback @Kyle_Langham ! 
Adding ease of deployment to the efficiency goal makes sense and this is now included in the post. I also did some small alignments for consistency on this category which is now called Efficient & scalable throughout the text (in the original version I had sometimes "Efficient" and sometimes "Efficient & scalable").

kvic | 2022-05-09 23:35:20 UTC | #14

The following vote as I understand it was placed within the system by Dfinity and I don't see too many problems with it.

What I read is that it is the active not the inactive that are creating problems by looking through the code and seeing how and to do spamming. Yet I see more about how to make the inactive pay the price.

Please understand that I love to see solutions and the forum trying to do something to fix the active problems but I have to give my opposite view.

It seems to me that we should stop the spammers and their behavior.

As I understand the spamming problem
There are neuron owners that have large quantities of coins but more importantly receive many more rewards than most for voting.

A demonstration I saw was about 2 examples that referred to 1 holder having 60,000 icp while the other had 32,000 icp. 

So I believe, while we can follow and receive rewards from following and there seems to be much to vote on each day that some feel they can earn more rewards by putting up bogus proposals to earn further rewards.

I see it was proposed to raise the cost per proposals for failure around a model of coins equal for all holders that put forward a proposal.

I believe the 2 examples of the holders above would receive 100s of icp a year while I will receive 10s of icp a year for the same voting.while the cost of a proposal is the same for all.

This could make it costly for myself but for those with larger amounts of coins would still feel this is not expensive for them and may continue to spam.

If you were to change this to a percentage of your whole stake then this would make it more equal. The only ones that would complain are those spamming.

We would then find those same clever people, retain their advantage by setting up smaller neurons for a proposal and for that I would think that we could calculate the percentage on the anchor to include all neurons.

But then I have never put forward a proposal and I am not sure of the process other than seeing what I feel is a proposal for spammers that are laughing at us right now and myself the follower feeling bad about myself.

Maybe I don’t understand the issue correctly and maybe I will see my stupidity at a later time but at this time you must forgive me for feeling the need to voice my opinion.

[/quote]
Here are a few things to consider to address this issue:
1 - I think active voting power will quickly reach into the 75+% level very soon after periodic Followee confirmation is implemented.  Hence, this concern will likely be resolved naturally.
2 - Dfinity holds [voting power in many neurons](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-voting-power/11801) according to @diegop.  If you find that you have too much voting power compared to the rest of the NNS, then you can choose to not vote with some of the neurons.  
3 - To be honest, I would rather start with Dfinity having too much voting power in the very beginning than to continue with the voting participation imbalance that is currently caused by default following on All Topics.  I think this is a minor issue and would be glad for Dfinity to have too much voting power if active voting power is adopted as the reference point for voter participation.  I like this enhancement a lot.
4 - There is always the option of setting up some of the Dfinity neurons to follow other public known neurons in order to ensure that the Dfinity neurons are maximizing voting rewards during a transition to increased voter participation.  Since Dfinity owns their voting power, they can choose to follow any other neuron for any reason they want just like everyone else.  You could even use this as an incentive for new public neurons to surface by giving them a voice.

Those were just several ideas that come to mind to address the concern.  However, I'm not really that concerned.  I think the issue will quickly go away on it's own.

As I understand voting: If you have a stake under 6 months then you get no rewards but I not so sure of that. I signed into the NNS and was getting familiar with the information. I filtered proposals that were rejected and started viewing these and I assume they are the spam that is mentioned.

Each one I went through I noted that the information displayed: dissolve delay < 6 months and 1 with created after proposal.

This was displayed within the Ineligible Neurons information:
The following neurons had a dissolve delay of less than 6 months at the time the proposal was submitted, or were created after the proposal was submitted, and therefore are not eligible to vote on it:

But I can also see that these proposal where voted on by the adopt or reject numbers.

Too many thoughts and question are going through my head so I would rather some one tell me that ineligible persons are not getting to create proposal and get rewards.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-05-12 21:48:24 UTC | #17

Did my last comment make this discussion redundant?

Short summary: To drive forward the discussion on how we can improve governance, especially to prevent spam proposals, we propose how new design proposals can be evaluated. We provide a first evaluation of some of the designs proposed in the forum, and we propose a roadmap on how to proceed with this discussion.

If those who have less than 6 months can’t make proposals then half or most of the spam is gone and continuity picking on the inactive followers to remove them from receiving rewards is self governance for your personal gain. Do the inactive know how you speak about them like this and are they aware this forum exists and want their participation?

I love the default setting that Dfinity set, shows a set of values and good leadership but the rot I see coming into this system is the greed and selfishness from within and not just from the spammers.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-05-13 06:49:23 UTC | #18

Hi @kvic 
To make sure that I understand your thought process and idea:
* You observed that the neurons which are making spam proposals have typically a dissolve delay smaller than 6 months. 
* Hence you propose that only neurons with dissolve delay bigger than 6 months should be able to submit proposals. 

Is this a fair summary?  From my perspective such a rule would not create a real hurdle to spammers. He/she could simple use one neuron with dissolve delay greater than 6 months which is easy to set up.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-05-13 06:51:13 UTC | #19

[quote="kvic, post:16, topic:12801"]
If you have a stake under 6 months then you get no rewards but I not so sure of that.
[/quote]

To make it slightly more precise: If the **dissolve delay** of your neuron is below 6 months, then your voting power and allocation of voting rewards is zero.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-05-13 08:16:56 UTC | #20

Your interest in my mindset is interesting when I feel I have observed a pattern about a problem with spammers that is the concern of this discussion.

I feel that the pattern observed is the mindset of the problem that you are referring to. That spammers can purchase or set up a neuron with 1 icp and then cause all the spamming they like with little risk. That all the observed spam proposals had the same pattern of being under the 6 month period. Your issue seems to be with me and not seeing my observation.

I am not trying to be fair, if you want to behave improper then I will provide my point of view but I see again you are protecting the improper and that I am unfair. 

You are right, I want those too gutless to invest into the nns for greater than 6 months that have not risked their investment for better not to have a say in the nns but you would prefer to protect them and ridiculed me as having the wrong mindset.

I wonder about your mindset.  

I wonder if the spammers mindset is that if a vote is designed to un-reward those neurons that spam they will lose very little but you prefer they stay.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-05-13 22:15:22 UTC | #21

* **Proposer:** The ID of the neuron that submitted the proposal. When a proposal is submitted, a “charge” is placed on its balance in case it is rejected. So the balance needs to be big enough to pay the charge on (all) rejection(s). We require a neuron to have a dissolve delay ≥ 6 months to vote, and this applies to submitting proposals too.

Hi all, 

I would like to give you a short update on discussions within DFINITY on the topic of spam prevention: 

In my analysis, I initially focused on solutions which significantly reduce or completely remove the created financial incentive to submit spam proposals as first step. After further syndication, it became clear that there is a desire to come up with a more holistic solution if possible. 

I will now continue to look into this (with limited capacity as a side project) and will come back once I have further thoughts and suggestions. 

So for the time being this a non-conclusive update, but I thought it might be still useful for you to know. 

Have a great weekend  

Björn

I have mentioned this before but I have notice a pattern within the NNS voting tab where the spam has the same Proposer ID which I assume is a unique number given to a Neuron which displays the same information of a lock neuron for: **5 years, 192 days - Dissolve Delay**, the only thing that changes is the voting power which is because of the rewards paid to themselves for the spam they have created. 

6.3-test	Proposer: 16392997059792243989
6.2-test	Proposer: 16392997059792243989
6.1-test	Proposer: 16392997059792243989
5.31-test	Proposer: 16392997059792243989

Which at the moment is 14 proposals inline of the above. I only printed those 4 but the same Proposer ID is used.

In my mind if, that proposer is a known spammer then I can think of many ways to have a holistic approach to fixing this problem but maybe I misunderstood this.

Creating new neurons is very simple, I suggest that DFINITY should freeze all my ICPs and cooperate with governments to KYC neurons

They cannot freeze anything because you are not doing anything illegal.
KYC with government is only a matter of time.  This will happen 100% guaranteed.
But government are always very slow to figure out.  So it may take few years. Make a screen shot of this post and mint as NFT.

In my opinion, there are methods to combat spam proposals as follows: 
1. Set reward and penalty rates according to the credit scores of proposals (for example, approved proposals will accumulate credit points from previous proposals and reward them.  then it will increase gradually, and vice versa if Neron continuously creates spam proposals that are not approved, it will lose its credit score and will be penalized - ICP from Neron spam -> this fine will be burned)

2. When submitting a proposal to NNS for voting, you will need to make an ICP deposit.  If the proposal is approved by the community, ICP will be refunded + rewarded.  Conversely, if the proposal is not approved, some ICPs will be deducted and burned.

Both of the above options will eliminate the current spam proposals in NNS like now.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-06-07 08:01:42 UTC | #38

Thank you @kvic and @Tony89 

These are good ideas going in similar directions! Essentially you are stating that we should consider penalising neurons if they continue to submit spam. 

For this we would need to think about
1) How to identify whether something is spam or not - probably by a separate spam yes/no assessment done by the community. 
2) Make sure that that it is not too easy to circumvent the penalty, as it is easy to generate new neurons (which is the point from @ysyms above). To address this we could for example require that a neuron has a high stake (e.g. 1000 ICP) in order to be able to make a proposal. If the same neuron proposes spam a couple of times it could be blocked for some time to submit proposals (or a part of the stake could be burned).

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-06-07 12:27:17 UTC | #39

@bjoernek the problem to know if it is spam or not is very simple, next to the Adopt button, Reject just needs to add a Spam button.  When the community selects the Spam button, it is a proposal that has not been approved and is a spam proposal.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-06-07 16:45:40 UTC | #40

I am not saying that we should penalise, I would say, if the community rejected a proposal then a rethink of that proposal should be held with the community and the neuron should not be permitted to make a proposal for a time without affecting the neuron owners rights to make changes or vote on that neuron.

I think having more than one or many neurons could become very tedious and setting the stake to a high value won’t affect those who have the most to gain as they have large numbers. This would affect a person like me who wants good things but can’t afford the entry value for a proposal which is then a penalty to me.

Setting up a filter to lock out a neuron that the community has deemed rejectable gives the time needed for the community to decide what action to take for that neron but the filter, as pointed out, can have the power to lock out a neuron decided by the community by rejection before an damaging update to the NNS.

A lockout should be the penalty and not giving out fines as burning someone's stake. A bad idea today could be considered a great idea in the future and then a neuron holder would have a right to a claim. 

@ysyms has shown the community their neurons are obvious spam but a real spam would disguise itself as an official proposal and be passed by the community who lack programming skills. The proposal could have all the right words but the code could be damaging and nothing to do with the written.

I am not sure but I would hope that any code created to be updated to the NNS has been approved by a IC team and updatable to the NNS by that team only and not some code anyone can write and can then update the NNS?

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-06-09 10:15:38 UTC | #41

I'll try to stay on topic, despite the over-engineering and ever-decreasing circles.

So we should create a holistic solution to a problem that arose because no-one (apparently) considered the undesired possible effects of making "governance" motion proposal worth 200 times some others. 

Perhaps the solutions should consider the voting weights as part of the solution, rather than tacking on bulky review processes, a human-led judgement of neurons and some kind of crime and punishment system, all in the name of trying to correct a simple change that massively (and obviously) incentivises exploitation of the voting system.

I have put forward a proposal that I think is more elegant solution and is one that can be also be integrated into other ideas. This idea focuses on allowing the community to respond effectively, rather than trying to build every eventuality into the code itself, while not doing anything about the exploit incentivisation.

I am more apathetic now, partly because I care less about staring at pages of spam on the NNS and partly because there is a clear agenda to prioritise participation over a balanced reward scheme. Why else would Dfinity reject reverting the weights to 1, and only treat a resolution as a side project.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-06-11 13:14:50 UTC | #42

@bjoernek @Jan Please take action soon to eliminate spam proposals.  it feels very uncomfortable for people who want to participate in voting and administering the NNS.  

It looks like an abusive and unconscious act of someone thinking only of their own interests and forgetting about the people around them and the community.

I think it is more important than all the other proposals that need to be addressed soon.  thanks a lot.

@bjoernek @Kyle_Langham 

Given that proposal [70015](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70015) appears that it will pass, I would like to revisit this assessment you made for proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) and ask DFINITY to consider it with higher urgency.  I agree with the increasing and decreasing assessments you made as previously indicated in my comments, but I don't agree with the neutral assessments and I now think they are more relevant to discuss.  My recommendations are provided in the markup and descriptions below.

Reactivity assessment - I agree it is decreasing because all routine business proposals such as Subnet Managements and System Canister Management have a 4 day voting period and we need Absolute Majority to be executed by liquid democracy of default following of DFINITY to implement them quickly.  However, I see nothing wrong with setting the voting period for these proposals to 24 hours (or whatever) and executing them when the timer runs out.  Of course, this assumes DFINITY can respond within 24 hours if someone other than DFINITY submits a proposal.  DFINITY will cast their vote for or against and they will always execute at the end of that shorter voting period because DFINITY owns far more than 3% of the minimum voting power required to execute a proposal by Simple Majority.  Plus a lot of people will configure their neurons to follow DFINITY on these proposal topics anyway since DFINITY is the only logical choice and people want their voting rewards.  There is no public review of these proposals that matters today anyway.  They are all executed the moment DFINITY casts a vote due to default following and that typically happens within minutes to hours of submitting the proposals.  Hence, the enhancement that is needed that changes the assessment of Reactivity for proposal 55651 seems as simple as changing the voting period for these critical proposal topics.

Long-Term Thinking - Active voters are more likely to vote in the long term best interest of the IC.  Default Followees enable people who have no interest in long term thinking to share a higher fraction of the voting rewards that are intended to be allocated to people who are thinking long term.  Proposal 55651 provides a better definition of minimum active participation.  Hence, I don't understand how proposal 55651 can be neutral on this assessment criteria.  You assessed proposal 55651 as neutral on Long-Term Thinking, but it seems to me it should be increasing.

Efficient & Scalable - The overall assessment strategy that you designed is intended to compare and contrast all the various proposals that have surfaced to address the spam issue.  I see no scaling issues for proposal 55651.  I would argue it is equally scalable as the current NNS governance design and that compared to other proposals that have been considered it is more scalable and easier to scale.  In fact, once implemented, there is no limit to how much it can scale without any further dev intervention.  You assessed proposal 55651 as neutral on Efficient and Scalable, but it seems to me it should be increasing.

Simple and Accessible - Tokenomics are intended to attract and retain participants who want to be actively involved in governance and think in the long term best interest of the IC.  Proposal 55651 creates a definition of minimum active participation.  All neurons that were created at genesis and in the first year after genesis were set up to follow DFINITY by default in the All Topics category, which means they automatically started receiving voting rewards without having perform any work or make any decision about governance.  It's a completely passive configuration that the neuron owner did not choose.  The definition of active participation in proposal 55651 is extremely simple.  It only asks neuron owners to confirm followee selections every 6 months by pushing a few buttons.  That seems simple and accessible at scale and actually achieves the intended outcome of the tokenomics of ensuring that people are intentional about their governance participation.  Hence, I would argue is is an improvement.  You assessed proposal 55651 as neutral on Simple and Accessible, but it seems to me it should be increasing.

I'd be interested in knowing your thoughts given this feedback.  Thank you for considering these suggestions.

If you fall in this category then you should at the very least check in once every couple months to see whats going on, if you don't want to do that, I'm sorry but you don't deserve the rewards. I don't care about politics too but I have the decency of keeping myself informed to make somewhat informed decisions and check out what my party is doing. In real life it'd be absurd to entrust someone with your vote for life, so I don't see why it should be an acceptable practice on the NNS where we have an investement at stake and get rewarded for our attention.

We get rewarded for contributing our voting power. We can either do that manually, or by empowering a followee. All of these extra definitions and unwritten bylaws that people throw around on the forum is just conjecture until it's been ratified by the NNS. Proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) is the first time a reset period has been defined. This implies a minimum level of participation and I think it's good for the network; but this didn't exist when the follower settings changed. 

To be clear, i agree that changing the follower settings was a necessary evil in order to help decentralize the NNS. At the time, it helped break stakeholders away from the foundation.

I am just tired of all  these excuses for why it was okay. The most annoying being our attempts to label these individuals as passive or negligent simply because they may take a long-term approach to managing their investments. It also annoys me that we continue to label them and use their behaviour as justification for further change. If our only reason for suggesting a change is because "we deserve it more" then I'm probably not going to be for it.

I make the assumption that any person who is dissolving their neuron is perfectly capable of meeting a minimum definition of active participation just like everyone else.  There is no effort to prevent anyone from participating in governance.  Default followee configuration had utility to bootstrap the network, but it is stifling decentralization at this point.  In case you have not been paying attention, DFINITY and ICA have voted on all governance proposals for well over 2 months now.  They are an excellent choice for a followee, but perhaps even they should be an intentional choice made by neuron owners.  We also need more named neurons, which is acknowledged and encouraged by everyone, yet nobody has stepped up to provide new options.  I would still love to see The Fools Court in this role.  I was very happy to learn that Psychedellic will pursue this role in their town hall recently.  There are so many other people and organizations in the IC community that could do the same.  Contrary to what you seem to want everyone to think, I by no means believe that active voters only follow ICPMN, ICDevs, or cycledao.

Which part makes you sad?  Here is the most recent Subnet Update as an example.  Proposal executed less than 1 hour after it was submitted...98% of total voting power in the NNS already cast...3 days 18 hours left in the voting period.  This is routine business executed quickly and rightly so.  Any desire for the public to be able to vote on these types of proposals or review them with capacity to stop them at this stage of the IC just doesn't make sense.

What would happen when a bad actor controlling > 3% of the voting power submits a malicious proposal and DFINITY for some reason doesn't vote on it within that one-hour voting period? Your suggestion depends on a quorum of humans at DFINITY monitoring and voting on proposals 24/7.

I'm in favor of [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651), I'm just pointing out a problem with the one-hour voting period idea.

I agree.  When that day comes, adjustments will need to be made.  This is why we have a mutable governance system.  Change is necessary and the NNS provides that flexibility.  My point is that today there is no chance for any other organization to push back on these proposals, so I don't see the need for the larger voting period window.  DFINITY is the deciding vote and there is nothing anyone can do about it today.  Nor do I think anyone wants to do anything about it today.  It will take time to get to the point where that is relevant.

This is an excellent point.  The idea will need additional consideration because we cannot let that happen.

@Dylan I modified the original comment to 24 hours instead of 1 hour.  Take a look and let me know if you still see a gaping issue.  I suggested 24 hours since that was the original voting period for all proposals.  I would think the question that needs to be considered is if we really need to be able to implement changes to these proposal types faster than 24 hours.  If so, then the idea still requires additional consideration.  Perhaps there is utility in limiting the neuron IDs that can submit proposal types that are of certain critical nature or maybe there is already a limitation on who can submit that code to GitHub.  I think my main point is just that we should consider a much shorter Voting Period for proposals where is is important to consider Reactivity.  I don't think that Voting Period needs to be the same as it is for Governance proposals.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-07-18 22:15:06 UTC | #59

I think a 24-hour voting period addresses the concern that I had about bad actors, but then you're back to the situation where you may have to wait 24 hours to pass important proposals. That's better than 4+ days, but a lot longer than the current ability to pass these proposals essentially immediately. The ability to pass proposals fast is important. Imagine if some security vulnerability needs to be fixed, and every minute it's not fixed bad things are happening.

Just thinking out loud, perhaps this concern could be addressed by changing the (proposal 55651) proposed way that the confirmation would work. For example, say that all neuron holders had to confirm their followees once a year before January 1st, but that the NNS wouldn't actually remove followees from any neurons on January 1st unless (or until) a certain threshold of voting power had confirmed their followees. You would then set that threshold in a way that virtually guarantees the effective voting power of DFINITY with following doesn't drop below 50%. In other words, a Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees would be implemented, but if not enough neuron holders confirmed their followees, nothing would happen. This way the functionality could be implemented without relying on the hope that neuron holders would indeed confirm their followees.

Though I suppose choosing such a threshold could be difficult.

I agree 1000%.  Also, I always said that dead voter (or many of them), who could be a whale,  providing their vote to make a proposal to pass or not is 100% non sense, and is looking really bad for the entitre governance system.  Dead voter need to be eliminated from voting, the sooner the better.

Hi @wpb and @Dylan, 

I agree that we should focus the discussion on the criterium reactive, as this is currently the main drawback of the proposal on periodic re-confirmation of followees. So essentially, how can we ensure that very urgent fixes can be implemented immediately. 

One possible solution (based on a discussion with @Manu) could be to vote on granting hotfix update permission to trusted developers on a temporary basis (e.g. for 2 weeks or a month). This way the urgency of the update would be decoupled from the prior vote. 
@Manu: Did I summarise your idea correctly and would you have further points to add?

-------------------------

I like that idea a lot.  It probably opens up the opportunity for the public to perform more code review on non critical updates while still enabling critical hot fixes.  Seems like a move toward decentralization.

Building off of @Manu’s point, if we’re talking hotfixes/patches, what about a model where there’s ~10 developers that have the privilege to review and approve a hotfix/patch, and that only a certain fraction of them need to respond in order to push out the change? Maybe there’s some sort of Pagerduty integration for these chosen few.

Btw, how is the DFINITY neuron currently managed for pushing out hotfixes? What happens when it’s the middle of the night in Switzerland and an on-call alert goes off that requires an immediate patch fix? A developer submits a code change proposal, but then does someone wake up the person (or people) in charge of the DFINITY neuron? 

I can’t imagine that Dom or Jan are the ones pressing the accept/reject button on all of these proposals.

I posted this in a different thread but realized it might be helpful to post the suggestion here: 
[quote="rusty.scrivens, post:165, topic:14275, full:true"]
could it be as simple as having a hotfix(or urgent proposals) follow category and so when the followees gets reset, it gets set to a default of following Dfinity on hotfixes?

One of them is always at the button.  12 hour shifts.

Is this serious? Just the 2 of them, with only one other person/level of escalation…that sounds rough for sleep!

Don’t they both live in the same time zone?

Phew, good one haha!

Yea I remember this answer by you from awhile back

[quote="diegop, post:12, topic:11385"]
There is a single DFINITY neuron that the community knows. That neuron follows a group of 9 neurons (each controlled by different people within DFINITY). So, practically speaking, DFINITY votes along the majority of the 9 DFINITY members (I am not one of the 9)
[/quote]

How do those neurons vote on urgent hotfix proposals (where they need a majority of the 9 to vote for the neuron to vote)? Are they all paged and/or alerted for every single one of these votes?

That’s still a lot of people getting pages 😉

Quite literally, yes. They are all paged and they vote even at very odd hours. I am glad I am not one of them.

Thank you @rusty.scrivens, I think this is a great idea. In effect, it is a little bit similar to what I mentioned above but probably simpler to implement. Let me think about it.

bjoernek | 2022-07-29 16:59:07 UTC | #73

Hi @rusty.scrivens, I suggest that we discuss your idea in the first session of the (to be established) technical working group on governance & tokenomics. 

Due to the focus on the SNS work (and holidays) I suggest to have the first session in September (further communication to follow).

You can also look at it as an extra incentive for those people to prioritize stability :grin:
