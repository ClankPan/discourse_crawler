I currently have a canister address hardcoded:
```
  let nativeIPCToken = "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"; // native NNS ICP token.
```

But how to debug this?

So, I have several more questions:

- If I want to substitute a locally compiled canister in "debug mode", how to do this (maybe, by passing `debug: Bool` to canister initialization? but this seems not to be a very good method). Something like C preprocessor?
- Can I call IC canisters from the live network from my local canisters running on DFX (`dfx start`)? (If no, adding this would be a good feature, I think.)

1) Relevant discussion: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/env-variables-for-motoko-builds/11640
TLDR; you can use actor classes if your canister doesn't have init parameters, otherwise a bash script or using MOPS are the only way for now.

2) No you can't call mainnet from local environment, I remember it was discussed in the past but there were security concerns and Dfinity preferred to go with `dfx pull` as an alternative.
