We (the ELNA AI dev team) propose to add liquidity to the [ELNA/ICP pool on ICPSwap](https://info.icpswap.com/swap/pool/details/yonq6-5qaaa-aaaag-qdklq-cai).

Following this motion proposal we will submit 2 additional proposals to transfer 7000 ICP and 1,200,000 ELNA respectively to the ELNA/ICP Swap canister owned by ICPSwap (ne2vj-6yaaa-aaaag-qb3ia-cai).

The destination account for both of these transfers will be the same (but on 2 different ledgers) and is as follows:

**Principal** yonq6-5qaaa-aaaag-qdklq-cai

**Subaccount** [10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 154, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

(this is the Subaccount generated from the ELNA AI governance canister Id, gdnpl-daaaa-aaaaq-aacna-cai)

[@ICPSwap](https://twitter.com/ICPSwap) will tweet to verify that these details are correct.

If these proposals pass, ICPSwap will then add the funds to the liquidity pool. Half of the funds transferred will provide liquidity in the range 839.25 -> 93.25 ELNA per ICPand the other half will provide liquidity in the range 93.25 -> 839.25 ELNA per ICP.

Subsequent proposals can be made to add more liquidity or to adjust the ranges if the price of ELNA moves significantly.
