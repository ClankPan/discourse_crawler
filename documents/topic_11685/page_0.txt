We had [a last minute finding that had to be cherry picked into the latest release](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/9817eb2304d45c2c6ec5e0050b8cc4e72919c314). We therefore need to provide a new commit hash and [the corresponding proposal for election](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52144).

This was a very special rollout week. [We completed the rollout today by upgrading the NNS subnet](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/53053) but not with the replica that we started with. We just posted an update according to our [security patch policy and procedure](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/feedback-wanted-security-patch-policy-and-procedure/11069) explaining what happened [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cycle-balance-underflow-incident-retrospective-friday-april-1st/11908).
