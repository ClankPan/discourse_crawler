I just shared a tutorial that displays how to repeatedly calls a function on the IC with web workers - without decreasing dapp frontend performance.

I ❤️ web workers, they are so handy. Ping me for questions or idea of improvements!

If you want to skip the reading, I also put together a sample repo 😉

Thank you, David! Your work inspires me, I also decided to use web workers and could not understand for a while why the actor was not created, I read [the comment in your repository](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/icwebworker/blob/3ca7f9be9b7c3c28e4e5b966315cbc35fafc6bc7/src/icwebworker_frontend/src/worker.js#L53-L57) and this was the solution to my problem! I don't use this variable so in my sh script I added:
```
sed -i'.bak' '/^export const main/s/^/\/\//g' src/declarations/main/index.js
```
After that, I can import the necessary variables from `index.js` and the web worker will not break.
