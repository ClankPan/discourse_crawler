## Overview

Status: Closed
Project Type: Competition
Time Commitment: Days
Experience Level: Intermediate
Size: USD 1000 in ICP (At time of distribution, will be shared among participants)
Deadline: Bitcoin Halving, April 20th, 2024


## Description

Chain-key Bitcoin (ckBTC) provides non-custodial payments with 1-2 second finality and negligible fees. It is a multi-chain bitcoin twin, created by chain-key cryptography and ICP smart contracts that directly hold raw bitcoin without relying on intermediaries.


## Purpose and Target Audience

With this bounty, we'd like to explore the design of a dedicated ckBTC landing page (independent of internetcomputer.org).

The landing page should be focused mainly on potential users of ckBTC. Developers are only a secondary audience.

- Explain why a user should use ckBTC.
- Create confidence in the security of ckBTC.
- Showcase where and how you can use ckBTC.
- Enable users to connect their ICP wallet and exchange BTC for ICP.

##  Expected Content

- What is ckBTC.
- Some real-time information (e.g. TVL, Volume, Number of transactions).
- Directly exchange BTC for ckBTC.
- A graphical overview of how ckBTC works.
- Ecosystem overview where you can use ckBTC.
- A FAQ section.
- Links to developer resources to integrate/leverage ckBTC.

These are not hard requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Figma design of at least a single landing page that can be used as a blueprint for an implementation.
- Responsive design. Includes at least a desktop and mobile view.

## Future Plans

We might give out a second bounty to the winner to work with us to improve the design further.

## How to apply

Great bounty for designers to put into their portfolio. Upping the thread and bringing some references that look cool stylistically & might be an inspiration to someone.
