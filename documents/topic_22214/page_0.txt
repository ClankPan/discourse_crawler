Dear All,

Like many before me I have worked through the documentation and valuable support offered by this community to create a proposal for my company becoming a New Node Provider. My proposal can be found at [Proposal 124029 - ICP Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124029) for your review and approval.

Thank you for your consideration.
