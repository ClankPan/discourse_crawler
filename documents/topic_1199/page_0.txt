Hello my name is Joshua Davis,

I've been following Dfinity for some time but because I'm not a technical developer I haven't really had a chance to interact with anyone.  I just attended the "TUNGSTEN DEMO DAY: Technical Office Hours #2" with @Whizwang1 and @alexa.smith. They encouraged me to post to the forum to see if there might be some interest in TandaPay.  

I've been building an app for peer-to-peer insurance with the aim of generating reports of police brutality and sexual harrasment for three years. I just recently acquired patent rights to the idea and I have smart contract code for Ethereum already finished. If this is something that you might be interested in discussing I've written a lot about the protocol. You can start with these two posts here:

Thanks for joining our Technical Office Hours, @joshuad31! The P2P insurance app is an interesting idea.

If any developers are interested in helping build the above, feel free to reach out to @joshuad31!
