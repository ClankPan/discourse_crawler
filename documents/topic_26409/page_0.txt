Now I am developing a wallet function that needs to manage ICP balance.
How to monitor the arrival of ICP balance?
In addition to polling the ledger-api: `https://ledger-api.internetcomputer.org/`. Are there any other good ways?

You can interact with [ICP ledger](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai) or more conveniently with the [ICP index canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/qhbym-qaaaa-aaaaa-aaafq-cai)  directly.

If you want to interact from a client outside ICP using JS/TS, the simplest way is to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/ledger-icp

For your use case, you could call [`get_transactions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/ledger-icp#gear-gettransactions) periodically.

Thank you, I understand.

If it could support subscription, it would be even more perfect
