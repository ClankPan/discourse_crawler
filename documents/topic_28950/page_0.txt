As of a couple hours ago I'm getting a 405 (or canister not found) when with the command `dfx deps pull` on all my projects, and thus can't work with II locally.

Is this just a me thing or did something change here? https://icp0.io/api/v2/canister/rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai/read_state

Is this still happening? I can't reproduce the issue myself. Also, if you still run into problems, can you try `rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity/pulled/` and `rm -rf deps` to see if that helps?

Nevermind. I didn't change anything but it's working this morning. I'll delete my original post shortly.
