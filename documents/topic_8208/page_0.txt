Hey everyone, in an effort to consolidate my workflow and try to duplicate my effort less for frontend and Node.js topics, I'm going to start relying more on GitHub's Wiki and Discussions features.

I'll work to proactively document a lot more about frontend development using the Wiki, and discussions we have about changes and enhancements to the packages can live in the Discussions section.

There are two goals I hope to achieve with this effort:

* Continuing to decentralize our open-source packages
* Bringing the discussion closer to the code

In the long-term, I would like to see our packages controlled by a SNS, so that pull requests and npm publishing are approved by the community, rather than Dfinity team members. To that end, I would like to start nudging people to engage with the code more directly, by creating and following Github Issues, or even tackling some themselves.
