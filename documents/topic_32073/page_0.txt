Hello community !!!

I used plug wallet on DMail to buy an NFT email one time successfully

The second time for another NFT, i got deducted the required ICPs but NFT wasn't issued due to some failure. 

I have tried reaching out to DMail and Plugwallet but there has been no response. Is there any way i can reclaim my tokens 

Ihave used Metamask wallet to buy the second NFT using USDT and some change BNB but it was also a cumbersome process. 

Thank you

Salman

the transaction was refunded by DMail team by reaching out to them on their official telegram channel
