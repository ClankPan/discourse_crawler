Ahoy IC devs!

Please dont hesitate to ping this thread or @roman-kashitsyn for any questions.

Really really minor nit...

But is it possible to capitalize "integration" in "Financial integration"??

That's a good point, the capitalization is currently not consistent in the navigation tree. The top-level entries (except for "Financial integration") are Cap/lc, but most of the nested entries aren't capitalized. We should capitalize article titles consistently, not just at the top level. Thanks for pointing this out!
