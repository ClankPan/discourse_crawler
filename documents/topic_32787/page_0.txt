I want to create a canister with a method that receives a function name in a string and arguments in an universal format (CBOR?) and calls a specified canister with this function and arguments.

How to do it in Motoko?

There is [`ExperimentalInternetComputer.call`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalInternetComputer#value-call). You probably have to do a little decoding, but it should work pretty much out of the box
