Hey, I am building a new architecture for a marketplace for FT tokens. However, I am going back and fourth on what standard I should use and why. Please, could someone help me?

I am looking at ICRC-2 standard, but I have noticed there are also -3 and -4 now, however, how can I know if they are stable/not deprecated?

I found a sample on using ICRC-2 with Motoko (I am coding in Motoko), but I would like some further assistance. Is there any place specific to discuss topics regarding tokenization standards?

Thank you.

The ICRC-1 standard is the base standard, 2, 3 and 4 are all extensions on top of this standard.

A ready to use ledger implementation that implements all standards can be found here:  https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/icrc-1/icrc1-ledger-setup

Alternatively you can also implement your own ledger canister, you can start by implementing the base ICRC-1 standard and then move on to implementing 2, 3 and 4.

Besides this forum, the tokenization working group also has a channel on the IC Developers Discord.

We have a host of motoko libraries that implement these standards and give you hooks/event to tap into if your token needs custom functionality:

https://github.com/PanIndustrial-Org/ICRC_fungible has it all wired up and the icrc4 branch adds icrc4, but it has not been updated with the latest changes to icrc4 from the working group.
