I am reading the [Chain Key Cryptography](https://medium.com/dfinity/chain-key-technology-one-public-key-for-the-internet-computer-6a3644901e28) and I want to have a test:  verify a message inside some subnet using the public key of ic and subnet.   where can I find :

- the public key of ic and subnets
- a real message inside some subnet
