I had 4.99 staked maturity and wanted to get it above 5, so I pressed the button to stake 0.12 maturity and.... it was gone. Staked maturity still 4.99. Seems like a bug? Anyone else noticed something similar?

Hi @Bamsterdam the above is a scam. There is no live chat from dfinity and note the link isnâ€™t to support.dfinity.org.

Hi @Bamsterdam, I wasn't able to reproduce, and cannot find any bug.

Just wanted to clarify what you were seeing before and after you staked maturity of your neuron. 

## Scenario 1 (bug)

Before staking maturity, you have 5.11 maturity, and 0.12 is available:

After staking maturity, you have 4.99 maturity, and 0 is available:

This scenario would be indeed indicating that there is a bug, because the total maturity decreased after you staked maturity.


## Scenario 2 (expected behavior)

Initially, you have 4.99 maturity, and 0.12 is available (4.87 staked):

Afterwards, you have 4.99 staked maturity:

In this case, it is working correctly. 

Could you kindly confirm that the scenario 1 is what you were seeing, as far as you can remember?
