Hello. Where you can view more subtle settings of the dfx.json file for deployment on the main network? Admit: - I won't have any foreground (at least for now) I would like to remove it or make it inactive when building in wasm and uploading to the main network. - I would like to leave the local development container and add another main network container or even several. In fact, I have no idea about the parsing scheme dfx.json and would like to take a look at the structure of the description. Thanks.

I close the question. At the moment, you can do without the advanced settings of dfx.json.
