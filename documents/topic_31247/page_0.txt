Dear community,

I am trying to connect my custom domain with the canister id where I deployed my app frontend, using the boundary nodes method.

It's been a day or so where I keep getting the *PendingAcmeApproval* status from terminal.
Am I supposed to do something or just wait for approval?

I followed the instructions for first registration here:
https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/custom-domains/using-custom-domains#first-registration

And also setup Apex and Subdomain for Namecheap as mentioned here:
https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/custom-domains/dns-setup

Hey @cali-gian

Send me your domain as in a direct message and we can look into it. 

We had a short outage yesterday afternoon. But that was resolved and we successfully registered new custom domains since.

SOLVED: 
For the community, it may happen that the process is stuck with *PendingAcmeApproval* and then after 10+ hours it completes.
So far, so good :slight_smile:
