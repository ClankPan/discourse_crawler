Hey everyone,

I have a question about transferring ICP from one account to another. I'm using the `import IcpLedger "canister:icp_ledger_canister";` statement. Before initiating the transfer, I call the `ledger.icrc2_approve()`function. However, I encountered an error message:

Reject code: 4
Reject text: Anonymous principal cannot approve token transfers on the ledger.

Can anyone help me understand this issue?

here is the code: 

let Ledger = actor "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai" : LT.Self;
let icp_fee : Nat64 = 10_000;

  public  func transferICP(    transferFrom : Principal, transferTo : [Nat8],transferAmount : Nat64) : async LT.TransferResult {
      let res =  await Ledger.icrc2_transfer_from({
        memo: Nat64 = 0;
        from_subaccount = ?Helpers.getSubaccount(transferFrom);
        to = transferTo;
        //  The amount of ICP, minus the necessary transaction fee
        amount = { e8s = transferAmount - icp_fee };
        fee = { e8s = icp_fee };
        created_at_time = ?{ timestamp_nanos = Nat64.fromNat(Int.abs(Time.now())) };
      });
  };

The identity that you use to call `ledger_icrc2_approve()` is the anonymous identity. You need to use the identity whose tokens you want the canister to be able to spend later
