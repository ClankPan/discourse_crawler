Because of a different issue i found out that I'm actually not having a networks.json file in ./config/dfx directory while other developers have it. I found then [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dont-deprecate-project-specific-dfx-networks/17737) and now I'm not sure wheter it's best practices to have it or not. If it should exist, how can I re-create it?

Any thoughts on this?

For most people not having it (a.k.a. the defaults) should be good enough. If you have a `networks` section in your dfx.json, then you may want to migrate soon(TM), but we don't have any immediate plans of shutting off project-specific networks

To figure out where it would live, use `dfx info networks-json-path`
