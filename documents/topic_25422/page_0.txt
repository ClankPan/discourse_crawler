What category does this fall into ? Did anyone notice the " What's Changed" has more changes than the IC-OS replica update ?

Anyone keeping track or at least verifying the changes @ZackDS

Internet identity has a different repo and follows a different release process and release cycle than the IC Replica. So the list of changes should be different, right?
