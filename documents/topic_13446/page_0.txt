Proposals come with code changes, I’m curious as to where i can find the actual code changes that are being voted on within a particular proposal? Is there a way to pull the repository directly from the proposal submitted so that we can actually see the changes that we’re voting on? I don’t mean a public github repo, as someone could post one change in a GitHub repo and easily submit a different set of changes in a proposal. I wanna know if there is a way to get the code directly from the proposal itself. 

If not, how are devs currently going about conducting peer review before votes are made?

Github instructions how to compare the code between two commits: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/comparing-commits

Let's take the latest elected replica version proposal: [62143](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/62143)

In this proposal, you have at the top a link to a specific commit on the ic repo and its commit hash: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/5b2647754d0c2200b645d08a6ddce32251438ed5

If we look at the [releases section of the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases), we can figure out that the previous elected version was for this version: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/b90edb9897718730f65e92eb4ff6057b1b25f766

Using the instructions linked at the top, we can construct the comparison url as: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/compare/5b26477..b90edb9
