Just wanted to let everyone know that subnet pjljw is completely down. https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/pjljw-kztyl-46ud4-ofrj6-nzkhm-3n4nt-wi3jt-ypmav-ijqkt-gjf66-uae

Finalization rate of 0 blocks/s. :)

Can we just unplug it and plug it back in to make it work again? haha

Fwiw, I donâ€™t have any details other than I know some engineers are looking at it and they are too busy to give me details.

Looks query works now, but update still not working.

Even though the incident is still displayed on the status page, it seems alright now to me. I was able to deploy my canisters and perform query and update through my web app.

Just out of curiosity I used the [IC dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnets) to check the distribution of the canisters on the different subnets and here are some interesting facts:

* Currently total number of subnets is **22**.
* **23%** of subnets are serving **88%** of the total canisters.
* There are **12 subnets** that have less than **33 canisters**.
* Most crowded subnet award goes to **pjljw** with more than 4k canisters and come in second place **5kdm2** with less than 1500 canisters. 
* Most of subnets have no more than **13** Nodes except System subnet (34).

While number of canisters doesn't give the full picture of the load on the subnets it certainly can give some indication.
