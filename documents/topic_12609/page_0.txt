Forgive my ignorance but I just don’t know where to find this info a quick search of this forum yields nothing about node compensation.

AFAIK nodes are paid new icp that’s created based on the exchange rate their compensation is some sort of $ or sdr cost. Please correct me if I am mistaken.

Now that we are entering a true crypto winter bear market and Icp prices Keeps dropping like a bag of ….

At what price point does the inflation caused by the daily nodes compensation bill start to become noticeable?

What is the the compensation at now? Is it 1% 5% 10%?

At what price point does it start to hit 20% 50% 100% inflation?

Are we able to shut down nodes to save the IC from encountering an inflationary death spiral? Or is there already some mechanism to address what could become a real threat in the next 12-18 months of crypto winter?

Recent node provider rewards have been around 100,000 ICP per month in total. As you write, that monthly amount in ICP will increase while the ICP price is dropping, but at the moment we're talking about something like 0.2% inflation per year from those rewards, compared to some 8% inflation caused by voting rewards – which will decrease to about 5% in a few years. (Note that there are also deflationary measures like burning ICP for computation or ledger transfers, but admittedly they're on a much lower scale for now.) I have not done any model computation for _when_ the inflation for node provider rewards leads to a death spiral, but given the quick estimates above I think it is more of a theoretical problem than an actual threat.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-05-01 18:28:11 UTC | #3

Sweet thanks! So it seems that it really won’t be an issue (fingers crossed lol) unless price dumped to sub $5 or whatever

-------------------------

zpe | 2022-05-01 18:47:55 UTC | #4

That does seem problematic though, were price to see a 67% decline, that aspect of inflation would triple. That's a pretty big deal.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-05-01 19:20:00 UTC | #5

Right, but it's only the 0.2% would triple. Even if that happens, it's still by far less than the 8%.

100,000 ICP @ $20 /ICP = $2 M USD.


Assuming (rough order of magnitude) 500 nodes currently,  that's $4000 USD per month per node.

Assuming we see a 50% ($10 per ICP) price reduction (currently at $12.75) from $20, that would translate in doling out 200000 ICP. 

(A) if the price does dip to $5 per ICP, we would be doling out 400000 ICP to node providers. Further, if we increase the number of nodes to 1300 (as is planned) by EOY and price stays at $5, we would be pushing 1M ICP  to node providers.

Since node providers HAVE to provide for their opex, they WILL BE LIQUIDATING 1M ICPs. This is a death spiral if historical data is any indication. We just came of out Zone-1 of @Kyle_Langham zones and we may go into it again.

The two mitigating future proposals that will help are:

(A) lowering the rewards being provided per node. $4000 per month is very generous imo.

(B) stop the additional nodes being on  boarded right now. There is ZERO evidence that we are using even 10% of compute capabilities of installed capacity (we are NOT burning 10000 ICPs for compute needs per month).

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-02 06:21:01 UTC | #7

Does anyone know how much the per-month operating expenses are for a node provider on average? I wonder how much "profit" they are taking from the current ICP remuneration scheme.

In general, I do worry about the NNS minting far more ICP than it burns (at least for now). It [appears](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/68?u=jzxchiang) that we will increase the number of IC nodes from ~500 to ~1300 by the end of the year. Is that because we expect more cycle demand throughout the year, or simply because that was the plan from the start? Does it make sense to instead tie node onboarding (or even voting rewards) with the number of cycles burned?

Even though node rewards are small relative to voting rewards, there seems to be a material difference in their effect on selling pressure: as @mparikh pointed out, node providers must cover their operating expenses and it's likely at least some of them sell ICP to do so. Thus, it might be sensible to rethink how we set those node rewards.

On the opex cost for an ongoing hosting concern:

I calculate ~$1500 per node. Here's the rough cost breakdown (generously)

Assumptions: 
   A1-> node capex: $30000
   A2-> CAPEX Amortization Period: 3 years
   A3 -> CAPEX INTEREST APY: 10%
   

OPEX COST (PER MONTH):  $1500 (APPROX)
    NODE PRINCIPAL + INTEREST = $1000 approx
    Hosting Cost (50% of P&I ) : $500
        INCLUDE RACKING/STACKING, POWER/COOLING, REMOTE HANDS ETC

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-02 05:35:13 UTC | #9

On the plan to 1300 nodes from 500 nodes. I am , bluntly speaking, AGHAST because no appreciation has been given, seemingly, to the load predictions.

 A doubling of capacity or more WITH ZERO EVIDENCE of increased compute capabilities needs (followed with detailed calculations) would be LAUGHED OUT at the manager level ; leave besides getting to the executive level; in a normal setting. 

This seems like a very expensive science project.

The team REALLY needs to justify the need to the community to MORE than double the number of nodes.

Why Node Fees Are So Expensive

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-02 06:03:25 UTC | #11

Thanks for providing this information.

> NODE PRINCIPAL + INTEREST = $1000 approx

What does this item mean? Does this refer to the node rewards given to the node principal or some cost I'm not aware of?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-02 06:14:21 UTC | #12

Typically when you buy an expensive server, you take out a loan which causes you to pay interest on the loan.

So my $30000 server amortized over 3 years =~ 833 per month.

Now the interest on that amortized amount = 0.1×833 = 83

bumping the loan amount to = $916 / month (approx $1000)


This has nothing to do with rewards. Merely the cost of acquiring hardware & repaying the loan on a monthly basis. Hth

Edit: this is exactly why all profitable node providers MUST IMMEDIATELY liquidate their tokens(ICPs or otherwise)...otherwise they do not have a viable business.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-02 06:25:26 UTC | #13

Yeah, that's very helpful! thanks.

> (A) lowering the rewards being provided per node. $4000 per month is very generous imo.

Actually, based on [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/improvements-to-node-provider-remuneration/10553) I think that estimate may be a bit high.

It seems that monthly USD rewards per node range from $1169 to $3248 depending on where you operate the node. Your monthly operating expenses of $1500 may be too little, too much, or just enough... depending on the region of the world you run the node in.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-02 06:36:48 UTC | #14

True that cost would vary regionally. 

However recall that IC node providers have little wiggle room on the type of hardware they source. So their opex cost of acquiring a server remains within a narrow range. 

Because virtually all of the nodes are hosted in the "western" world, the expense of hosting it would also not vary drastically.

-------------------------

[/quote]

This is not consistent with 100000 ICP being provided at a estimated $20 ICP to all (500) nodes. I.e. 2m/ 500 = $4000....unless i am missing something. 

Edit: Unless we are paying the 800 IDL nodes ;which would be even more crazy. Because,  in that case , we would be paying for capacity that we already had but not deployed

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-02 06:52:38 UTC | #16

Hmm, I'm getting roughly the same numbers as you. (Actually, it's a little lower since the price of ICP was closer to $17 with the most recent April node provider payments, I believe.)

@diegop Would you happen to know?

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-05-02 07:31:57 UTC | #17

I think two aspects deserve clarification:
- The IC is already rewarding (most of) the 1'300 nodes we plan to add until EOY, actually all except for DFINITY's that are not yet deployed. So the rewards in XDR will actually increase only slightly until EOY. (The reason for this is bootstrapping: the IC needed a guaranteed supply of nodes in the beginning; the nodes all exist, they just haven't been onboarded.)
- The rewards are rather generous at the moment, which was necessary initially because the NPs were taking significant risk by investing in a project before launch. (They're not outrageously generous, they just factor in the significant risk of investment.) So I expect lower rewards for future generations of nodes, where risk is considerably lower.

This is the background for the numbers I gave above, and for me not being worried about this at the moment, despite the fact that theoretically this spiral exists.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-02 09:25:36 UTC | #18

Thanks for the clarification. 

A couple of questions: 

(i) If we had already purchased the capabilities of 1300 nodes, why didn't we deploy all 1300 nodes? Seems a waste of tremendous money ; given that we provided generous rewards for nodes to essentially do nothing for a year. Specifically what does it mean for "the nodes to exist "? That they are simply racked in the data center, not powered on?

(ii) Now that we are onboarding the legacy 800 nodes, i am assuming that they will NOT be conforming to AMD-Milan. So when we say "[quote="Luis, post:68, topic:9170"]
to ensure that the network is growing with nodes supporting SEV-SNP attestation.
[/quote] ", are we to presume that that growth will be in addition to 1300 nodes?

(iii)For how long are we liable for the cost of first generation nodes? These are the MOST expensive (counter to Moore's law). Is there a plan to phase them out? Given Moore's law, we should be replacing these nodes with next generation nodes.

Edit: see answers here (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/90) by Luis.

Hashimoto | 2022-05-05 22:35:31 UTC | #20

**The first thing we need is clarity about the figures.**

* Official clarification of the node rewards including QoS adjustments in a clear way.
* Dashboard and spreadsheet showing actual node rewards per day on a per subnet and per node basis so they can be analysed. 
* Dashboard and spreadsheet showing actual cycle and ICP burn per day rather than aggregated. This should be correlated with usage statistics.

**The next thing we need is a model burn vs usage as bounded by subnet capacity**

* That is at what level of usage does cycle burn exceed node provider rewards for a single subnet? (Model of different typical applications)
* Is it feasible for a subnet to become net profitable before performance degrades.

**then we should adjust economic parameters and manage capacity to try to ensure that subnets are "net profitable" most of the time** By this I mean cycles burned denominated in SDR > node rewards denominated in SDR.

**(1) adjust pricing**

* Change pricing of computation, messages and storage and so on in order to ensure that subnets can be net profitable before they are at capacity, while still offering good value to developers.  (This can be done in conjunction with a general review of pricing aimed at preventing spam and DoS attacks. It could also be non linear with prices increasing as a subnet becomes congested)

**(2) Have a rational approach to managing capacity increases and decreases**

* New subnets should be added when they are needed to cope with usage increases and spikes. However we should ensure that existing subnets are mostly "net profitable" and that burn exceeds node rewards on average.
* Consider 'fee market' type approaches to managing short term peaks in demand. That is it is better for costs to increase during a short term spike than for a subnet to stop functioning altogether.

**(2) Consider adjusting how nodes are paid**

* Consider variablize costs somewhat by aligning rewards more closely to usage and QoS performance.
* Consider making payments continuous based on an automatic in-protocol method so they use the same exchange rate as cycles rather than as a lump sum proposal based on average ICP price. 
* Consider adjusting overall incentives.

**Note:** the dependancy between (1) & (2). Subnets should be profitable in normal circumstances and certainly well before that threshold for spinning up a new subnet is reached. However onboarding nodes takes time so the threshold at which subnets are added should be chosen so that there is sufficient time to onboard more nodes and spin up a new subnet. We should therefore consider ways in which we can shorten the lead time and make it easier for nodes to be "on stand by" as well as ways of forecasting future usage.

**Finally** we should come up with a credible plan for the network to become deflationary "ultrasound money". That is we should develop a model of when usage and subnet numbers will rise sufficiently for the network as a whole to become deflationary with and without taking NNS rewards into account, and a have a strategy for achieving this. This may possibly include reducing NNS rewards but it would likely be hard to get that past the NNS even though it would be in better from a tax point of view as capital gains are typically taxed less than income.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-05-10 15:47:33 UTC | #21

indeed perhaps they see data that we are not made aware of, certainly i understand the need for added capacity.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation

according to this node providers have received about 1.6M ICP since network inception, where as in the same time frame about 72k ICP has been burned.

Correct me if I am wrong but we are spending about 22 ICP to burn 1 ICP.... that doesn't sound like a viable business model lol.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-10 15:57:24 UTC | #22

Not all of the burned ICP (72K) are due to compute / storage cost. Most of that (72k) is due to Sonic. I think that real number range is 220-1000 ICP spend to burn 1 ICP for compute/storage.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-05-12 01:32:08 UTC | #26

Regarding this mythical *death spiral*...

Let's say that hypothetically, the average ICP price over the next month was $3. That would result in higher node provider rewards than in the past, but the total rewards (node provider + voting) would create approximately the same level of ICP inflation that we had last summer. Even if the average ICP price was $2, total rewards would be only about 8.5% higher than they were last August.

The reason for this is that voting rewards decrease over time (see attached image), so voting rewards are significantly lower now than they were a year ago, and they will continue to decrease over time.

I won't attempt to perform an in-depth analysis, as @Kyle_Langham so expertly does, but there are other factors at play regarding sell pressure as well, such as the amount of ICP dissolving off of the NNS. As his [Supply Analysis Update](https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/supply-analysis-update?utm_source=%2Fprofile%2F25963567-kyle-langham&utm_medium=reader2&s=r) article describes, we are now entering what he calls "Zone 2", where the amount of ICP dissolving off the NNS will significantly decrease.

In summary, even if the ICP price were to drop significantly from its current level, down to where some people would be yelling "death spiral", the total amount of ICP entering the liquid supply each month could very well be lower than it was a year ago.

RatherIcy | 2022-05-24 13:57:51 UTC | #31

rewarding nodes that aren’t deployed, what a joke. It’s literally impossible to justify that.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-05-25 07:47:03 UTC | #32

The short answer here is: it's a temporary measure. It's a legacy from bootstrapping the network. It's phased out and will not be done that way going forward; all the nodes that are paid are currently in the process of being provisioned and are planned to be added to the network in the course of this year.

So why did we do this at all? The answer is: Bootstrapping a decentralized system is hard. The IC needed nodes to run on from day 1, decentralized to the best-possible extent. Independent NPs accepted the risk of investing into node hardware and data center contracts prior to the network even being operational. It's those nodes that stem from these pre-genesis times that do receive rewards right now, independently of whether they are actually contributing to any subnet.

Now there are of course questions like: Why are so many of those nodes not up and running after one year? To which IMO the answer a mixture of the IC anyway not running at capacity right now, and consistent improvements of the rollout process that make the process much easier now than it was a year ago.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-05-26 05:48:27 UTC | #34

It makes complete sense that you would need to do this in order to bootstrap the chain at launch.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-05-26 13:03:14 UTC | #36

Also if rewards really started to run away, wouldn't we as a community consider using the NNS to temporarily off-board node operators and shrink the network to cope with the inflation? I feel like there are many options available to us in that situation, it wouldn't just happen without us being able to intervene.

For example, if node provider rewards were running away at horrible rates, we could shrink subnet sizes and possibly even remove data centers, all temporarily, to the minimum amount needed to keep the current canisters running. Then we could very slowly add new operators as ICP price improves and as demand increases.

We might want to think about these kinds of contingency plans just in case.

I agree 100% with @lastmjs

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-05-26 18:01:18 UTC | #38

Yes, I agree that such actions could be taken if this ever became a real concern, like for the "What if 5 cents?" scenario asked about above, where the total market cap would be only about $24M. Personally, I'm not worried about it.

All blockchain networks need a model for incentivizing node providers/validators/miners, and those models are going to be challenged when the overall value of the network drops very low.

I think the ICP node provider rewards model is good. If some who are spreading "death spiral" FUD had their way, node provider rewards could already be lower than node provider expenses, in which case everyone might have turned off their nodes by now.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-26 18:38:47 UTC | #39

notagain | 2022-05-27 02:03:29 UTC | #42

we literally just watched a marketcap drop from ~30b to 45million in days because of a runaway inflation mechanism, so to think it could never happen to the IC is naive as long as such a mechanism exists. Why wait till it becomes a massive issue instead of cutting nodes now so it never becomes one? 

In fact, why don't we cut all of the dfinity appointed nodes and send them to the back of the line of the nns approval process like everyone else? can't really claim any of those nodes are decentralized when they were all appointed by the central foundation, so any claims of decentralization are tainted as long as they exist

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-05-27 07:53:39 UTC | #43

Regarding inflation: I don't think the cases are comparable. Node rewards are paid once a month, based on the average ICP price over the last 30 days. This also means that even a few days ahead of the reward payment, we can make very good estimates about the expected increase and the NNS still has enough time to react, even in the context of major market shifts. I also really suggest reading [Kyle's excellent post](https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/death-by-node-rewards-part-2?s=w), where he sets things into perspective.

Regarding re-validating pre-genesis nodes: I think that is an interesting idea. For bootstrapping, the Foundation validated the NPs because, well, the IC did not exist yet. Going forward, this task is squarely in the realm of the decentralized governance system. Re-validating the existing NPs is an option we should discuss, since I agree it improves the decentralization guarantees. CC: @Luis

-------------------------

notagain | 2022-05-28 07:21:39 UTC | #46

lets say crypto has a huge wipeout suddenly and price drops massively to something like 1 cent per ICP. If node provider monthly costs are ~400 dollars, that means 40,000 ICP printed per node machine, 500 node machines, thats 20 million ICP printed for one month's costs, and those 20 million are instantly sold because they need to be converted to USD to cover the fees incurred by the node providers and machines. 

The dashboard says there are only 44 node providers, but 500+ node machines, thats seems extremely centralized if those machines are provided by only 44 different entities and I'm not sure I would want to re-appoint the current ones, at least not all of their machines. Let other people have a chance instead of the obvious and excessive cronyism.

-------------------------

Hashimoto | 2022-05-29 10:07:11 UTC | #48

I'm not worried about the mythical run away inflation "death spiral", that seems unlikely, fixable (off boarding and reducing rewards), and also doesn't seem to matter for other blockchains.. 

I'm not worried about minting a ton of ICP in order to bootstrap the network. This seems to be an entirely sensible strategy to grow the network capacity to the level where it can support significant usage and claim market share. 

What concerns me is whether the ICP has a sustainable business model long term as usage increases, or whether costs will just be subsidised by minting more ICP than is burned forever. We need to be able to say something like *"In 5 years time when usage is > 60% of capacity operating revenue will greater than operating costs and more ICP will be burned than minted"*

This is a relatively simple matter of ensuring the economic parameters are set correctly so that a subnet operating at some achievable level of usage is profitable.

* If a subnet has 13 nodes and each node provider is paid say $2000 then costs are $26,000 a month.
* So filling up the capacity of that subnet should cost significantly more than $26,000 a month.

It really is that simple. 

* If this is already the case. We just need some simulations which prove it is the case. (What usage level corresponds to profitability?)
* If it is not the case we need to either increase the usage costs ([msg, compute, storage](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/computation-and-storage-costs/)), increase capacity, reduce the node rewards, or some combination thereof.

---
Edit 
Perhaps I am being dumb here but this looks like we are valuing 100% usage of the compute capacity of a subnet at $36/month, which seems insane.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-05-30 09:59:47 UTC | #50

Hi @Hashimoto, for calculating the cycle burn/compute capacity of a subnet one would need to consider update call cost, storage cost, canister installs and Xnet messages (number & size). In addition one would need to consider potential pricing of operations which are currently still free (e.g. query calls).

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-06-05 21:34:01 UTC | #52

According to calculations, the death spiral is unlikely to happen.  However, we should also have a plan to prepare for that situation (no one is sure what can happen) so anyway prepare a plan in advance to be able to react quickly when the worst case happens.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-08 08:49:51 UTC | #53

Absolutely true. That decision was absolutely horrendous and I think we have yet to see the price the network will pay for such an illiberal economic policy.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-08 09:12:28 UTC | #54

But what you describe is a death spiral.  What you describe is a company that issues shares to cover the costs of producing some service which it sells at a discount to the cost, each round the company needs to issue more shares at a lower price point to cover the costs.

Hence death spiral.

Also what you ignore is that a lot of the other coins out there well at least many of the top tier ones are able to sustain higher prices because of a fan base and hype as prior generations of investors have made money off the ponzinomics so to speak. That’s not the case with dfinity because of the way the seed was locked up it ensured a long period during which investors are losing money and that had a negative social loop that scares away new investors because people jump in when their friends are making money and do the opposite when they see their friends lose 99%. There is definitely a sort of luck component in crypto where the successful networks are bootstrapped from positive crowd outlook of speculators that icp lacks which unfortunately we have to deal with and I personally think is a significant handicap.

So some people here might call that fud but I call that reality.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-08 12:24:52 UTC | #55

Anyway I’m going to start unlocking my 8 year neurons this winter. If the price continues downward well into next year I will stop voting as the costs of doing accounting paperwork (book keeping, various govt/tax filings, other costs running a corp related fees) and paying taxes on the income while the underlying asset continues to lose value just don’t make business sense. 

I don’t know who else is in the same boat as me but I’m taking a wild stab in the dark here that unless you have the money and lawyers to set up some offshore company and also have connections to invest in node operations this just doesn’t add up as a serious business money making opportunity for others.

Combine that all with this systemic risk albeit small overall there just isn’t anything attractive to continue to invest time and money into this

I have to admit I have also been devastated by this coin, why does Dfinity seem to completely avoid addressing it? Every point @superduper has raised is valid. 

I have been in crypto for a decade and have never seen a coin like this, where it only crashed violently, where all loyal supporters were ripped apart and fleeced. And nothing was done to address it. You could at least say sorry for creating this situation. 

Unlock the seed neurons and let’s end this.

They can easily solve this death spiral problem but decide not to. I still think this project has potential later on but the tokenomics are trash. The idea is great but how dfinity treats its backers and the terrible tokenomics will be the fall of this project.

-------------------------

I think something Johnny Depp's lawyers said about why the jury believed him and not Amber Heard is relevant: they said Depp accepted many flaws while denying the central charges, while Heard refused to take accountability for doing anything wrong, which is why the jury ended up disbelieving her about everything.
If Dfinity would only say, "We are sorry we messed up the launch, we were unfair to seed participants, and our predictions of network uptake were way out of whack" most people will believe them when they deny the worst accusation, and frankly the only one that weighs on ICP's reputation and price, which is that the whole thing is a deliberate rug pull.
I can only assume Dfinity's stance is a result of being scared of lawsuits if they admit any wrongdoing. That's the only cause that rationally explains their obdurate refusal to come clean. At least I hope that is the reason.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-08 15:25:23 UTC | #60

Indeed maybe it is the lawsuit thing but they could pull a Janet Yellen. A little bit of humility goes a long way. Don’t think we will see it happening here and then 3 yrs on people at the foundation will be scratching their heads wondering why other networks are seeing explosive use.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2022-06-08 15:53:51 UTC | #61

An apology won’t fix much in the situation we’re in. It could change the publics light on the project. But I also think changing the tokenomics and paying out node providers with a stable coin rather than ICP would fix a lot. 

Based on what I’ve read through these forums the devs haven’t given up on the project. I don’t want this project to die in two years when dfinity runs out of funds to support the project. If they can fix the tokenomics I think this project will stay for good.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-06-08 15:59:01 UTC | #62

You are absolutely right on the adoption front. The devs have NOT given up on this project. The adoption curve is increasing. Hard work in the bear markets (overall macro) does pay off in the long term. 

On paying the node providers in stable coins instead of ICP. Are you suggesting that the NNS convert a massive amount of ICP to Stable Coin right now; in anticipation of a negative price correction in the future so that NNS has enough stable coins to pay the node providers for the next year or so?

-------------------------

Would you please clarify why Dfinity needs to apologize to seed investors?  They bought at $0.04/ICP about 5 years ago and were given 48 monthly allocations of their ICP starting a year ago, of which 1 installment was fully unlocked on day 1.  The price of ICP in the first month ranged from $500ish to $66 with average around $140.  Hence, they could have sold just the entire first allocation at over a 72x multiplier of their entire investment…and they still had 47 more installments waiting for them with tokenomics that
heavily favor dissolving those neurons because of the vesting schedule that delays liquidation of seed investors.  It seems like a very impressive return for a 5 year investment…at least I wish I had that opportunity.  I personally think the tokenomics have been incredibly beneficial to seed investors even if the vesting schedule was not expected or desirable to many.  I guess I don’t really understand how seed investors were treated poorly by Dfinity when they have benefited so richly.  I look at this from a post genesis personal investor perspective, so I can only wish I were one of the seed investors.  I would trade places with any of them any day if that were an option.

I do wonder why they were sattled with a 4 year vesting schedule and no one else was.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-06-09 01:29:59 UTC | #65

Everyone had a vesting schedule.  My understanding is that only the very earliest contracts didn’t have a vesting schedule and there were very few of them.  At least that’s what I’ve heard, but TBH don’t have personal knowledge.  That info may be in the original Messari report, but I’m not certain.

-------------------------

RatherIcy | 2022-06-09 02:03:05 UTC | #66

Stop blindly defending bad choices by dfinity. They should have unlocked all seed neurons on day one, end of story

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-06-09 03:55:03 UTC | #67

In calculating the value of an investment over time one needs to factor in not only profit but opportunity cost. In this case, how much would a person have made if, instead of putting money into the seed fund, they had invested it in other crypto assets over the same period. For instance, Binance launched its coin around the same time, and had provided a 500x return at the point Dfinity launched on exchanges.
Secondly, it was the manner in which the whole episode was handled (or not handled) that was worth an apology. The entire mess is described on a couple of threads on this forum, so I do not need to repeat it.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-06-09 09:03:05 UTC | #68

The vesting is used in the whole crypto space and always announced before the fundraisings. I never understood the general critics against Dfinity as if they were the only ones to use vesting mechanisms and as if they did it without warning people (if such a warning is still needed...).

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-06-09 10:39:53 UTC | #69

This thread explains the various issues with seed access, including the bad communication regarding vesting: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/seed-round-access/2765
My comment about how it would be good if Dfinity came clean was based on reading this thread and one other like it.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-09 11:47:18 UTC | #70

When the seed funds were collected there was 0 talk of vesting. Perhaps you ought to spend some time understanding the situation is different here.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-09 11:49:09 UTC | #71

When seed was collected there was nothing said about vesting this was created years later after the fact. And has obviously caused the downward price trajectory we are handicapped with.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-06-09 11:59:36 UTC | #72

@Denis @superduper really ? Wow, really sorry for you guys… sincerely.

-------------------------

RatherIcy | 2022-06-09 12:11:05 UTC | #73

Reality hurts. The fact is, I have heard no real rebuttal to the points made here about ICP’s tokenomics. Dfinity has admitted on several occasions that they should have made further consultation with accountants and economic analysts. Leave the echo chamber for once and let’s figure out a path forward.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-06-09 12:12:57 UTC | #74

Thanks for sharing.  I hadn’t seen that thread previously (admittedly because I’ve had no need to search for help on KYC or claiming tokens since I’m not a seed investor).  I can see how the launch built up to a high frustration level for seed investors.  It probably felt at the time like other early investors and highly skilled programmers were going to run away with all the profits and leave other seed investors behind.  I probably would have felt that type of panic as well.  Hopefully there is some level of satisfaction knowing that all seed investors are still in high profit even though they may not have been able to access the initial opportunity.  In spite of that emotional roller coaster, I still wish I were a seed investor, but the frustration does make sense.

ElDiablo | 2022-06-09 12:18:14 UTC | #75

yeh dude every coin dumps down 99% and completely bankrupts thousands of ppl (except the oh so special private investor) of course, I'm being sarcastic by the way

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-06-09 13:50:24 UTC | #76

It didn’t just frustrate seed people it also created a situation where people who bought icp the first months have been completely cleaned out because of the fact that such a small amount of icp was available. The price should never gone to $600 that was completely unnecessary and just gave away new buyers money to people shorting the f*** out of the coin.

I had no plans to sell significant portions in the first month but I definitely don’t like to see new fans of the project paying so much and then having the coin dump on them it creates bad vibes and hurts the project

I totally agree.  IC is doing something different than the current blockchain platforms on the market.  it's like a real research and game changer with real web3 vision.  so it takes time for the team to build and develop.  I guess you will see that in the next 5 years🚀

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-06-09 23:33:49 UTC | #79

Apology for what? Seed investors have made a lot of money on ICP.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-06-09 23:36:15 UTC | #80

What do you think could have been done to prevent the poor price performance?

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-06-10 02:29:18 UTC | #81

I find the idea that foundation should apologize to seed investors for putting them in a vesting schedule preposterous. These bought ICP at . 03 cents are still in massive profits even at current price. 

By the way all the major L1s who conducted an ico during that time frame  have some form of vesting schedules for seed investors and  sometime complete lockup for months before  vesting even kicks in. 

Spare me the whining. Retail investors paid 100x more than you and are still down.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-06-11 11:35:50 UTC | #82

Anybody who thinks that seed investors are whining should read about the various fairness experiments done with animals, beginning with capuchin monkeys. In fact, everybody should know about these experiments generally, because they teach us something fundamental about perceptions of fairness, something so deep it goes beyond homo sapiens.

What you describe is (at least theoretically) possible, I am not saying that it isn’t. What I was trying to say is that we’ll have about one month to react, even if things would go that way.

What would that reaction look like? Is there somewhere i Can find a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the issue of runaway inflation in the event that it’s gets to that point? There’s a lot of conflicting assertions made in this thread. I’m having a hard time separating fact from fud.

Agreed, I’d take anything at this point. Buyback, burn, a tiny airdrop. Dfinity has burnt retail investors to the tune of several billion dollars. Toss us a bone please.

-------------------------

2KEOY | 2022-06-12 02:51:49 UTC | #92

I prefer that they use their funds to develop the network rather than buying back or burning the supply.
We are not here for the short term, invest only what you can afford to lose. at 1 or 2$ per icp you can start to lower your average.

kvic | 2022-06-12 03:18:47 UTC | #93

Recently in my neck of the woods we saw prices for houses going to the moon. So a city lawyer and her builder husband bought 2 properties for close to 2 million each in the height of the fomo and now prices are going down, she has doubled in size and they are talking divorce.

They don’t realise the value of property. Like me when you own the property you can’t be thrown off and can enjoy the rewards when things are tight. They only see the money, not the property.

Just like the ICP token, the crypto price is down for the whole market.

I see the value of owning an ICP token and while the price is down I will buy more because I value the project.

You keep expecting DFINITY to perform some miracle to save you from doubling in size and want a divorce but that's not how it works.

Leave the DFINITY team alone and stop trying to weaken the token by changing the rules. Stop trying to rationalise the outcome as no one really knows anyway and stop arguing with negativity or profanity as it only makes you look bad and no one trusts you.

$1-2 per ICP would mean the long-term death of the project in my opinion, so I don’t think they would allow the price crash it to go that far. Let’s see what Dfinity have up their sleeve.
