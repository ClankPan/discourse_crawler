I'm using Rust to create canister from a main canister

```rust
use ic_cdk::{
    api::management_canister::main::{
        create_canister,
        install_code,
    }
};

// execute create_canister and install_code
```

Now the install_cose successfully, but I cannot use the candid UI to testing the created canister. Do anyone know how to publish the did file
