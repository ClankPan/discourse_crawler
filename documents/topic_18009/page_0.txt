Since the logo is not implemented in the token standard, I am now trying to set up a decentralized sale with these instructions: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/get-sns/local-testing. 

Unfortunately I encounter two errors here and I don't understand exactly what I'm doing wrong: 

Step 5 says execute the command `dfx identity use nns-ledger-default-identity`

I get this error:
```
Error: Failed to switch default identity to 'nns-ledger-default-identity'.
Caused by: Failed to switch default identity to 'nns-ledger-default-identity'.
Identity nns-ledger-default-identity does not exist at '/home/anon/.config/dfx/identity/nns-ledger-default-identity/identity.pem'.

```

I thought I need to create an identity with sns-quill. I installed this in the root directory and in the project directory. When I run this: `sns-quill generate --pem-file identity.pem --seed-file seed.txt`

I get this error: 
```
sns-quill command not found
```

What am I doing wrong?

Step 5
[/quote]

This identity refers to the identity you should have created at the end of Step 1. You can Ctrl+f for `make sure you also import the following identity`
If you imported this identity, replace `nns-ledger-default-identity` with the name you gave to the imported identity.

`sns-quill command not found`

You didn't add `sns-quill` to your `PATH`.

mindfulanon | 2023-01-18 14:05:43 UTC | #3

Right, my mistake. That's really logical. Thank you! 

I have now created the Identity and added sns-quill to the Path. Now I am wondering at step 6 where exactly my NNS dapp is supposed to be. I did dfx nns install. The instructions say it will show me two links. For me, only one link is shown and the command has been running forever now without finishing.

This is how it looks for me. Where can I find my local NNS? @Severin

`Uploading NNS configuration data...`

This shouldn't take too long. It takes 3-5 seconds on my machine.

Comparing with my own replica it looks like II and NNS dapp canisters are not even created yet. See last two canisters: 
![image|690x414](upload://ymSvURsb4v1ocNe2hIVdYcl8eiN.png)


The command is only done once it displays the following:

mindfulanon | 2023-01-19 13:15:20 UTC | #5

I made it work!

There are two identities mentioned and I can't exactly tell if they are different or the same. 

Is nns-ledger-default-identity the same as the developer-identity? 

Step 7v says: 
![grafik|603x93](upload://6GZoPctTq7noLMN3D6Kf3Varrgk.png)


Do I have to enter `dfx --identity nns-ledger-default-identity identity get-principal`? Or do I still have to create it and if so, how?

@Severin

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-01-19 13:41:43 UTC | #6

You're supposed to work with two dfx identities and swap between the two as needed. This step refers to the other one, not `nns-ledger-default-identity`.

I guess it's possible to only use one for everything, but I haven't tested it

-------------------------

mindfulanon | 2023-01-21 11:20:18 UTC | #7

I guess it only works with two because now I have to execute this command to put myself on the WL
```
$(dfx cache show)/ic-admin --secret-key-pem ~/.config/dfx/identity/$(dfx identity whoami)/identity.pem --nns-url "http://localhost:$(dfx info replica-port)" propose-to-update-sns-deploy-whitelist --added-principals "$(dfx identity get-wallet)" --proposer "$DEVELOPER_NEURON_ID" --proposal-title "Let me SNS!" --summary "I am friendly."

```
but this error comes up(while using nns-ledger-default-identity)
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Invalid secret key.: InvalidPem(Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: "PEM file doesn't start with 'BEGIN PRIVATE KEY' block" })', rs/registry/admin/src/main.rs:3196:48
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
How can I solve this? 


And how can I give other identities the possibility to get into the WL since if I want to use the default identity, for example, this is not possible

This will be fixed by the next dfx version. You can already try 0.13.0-beta.0 if you manually install it. The problem is that ic-admin on dfx earlier than 0.13.0 only supports secp256k1 keys, while dfx switched to producing ed25519 in version 0.12.0 (or was it the other way round? I may be switching the two curve names). Therefore: to use ic-admin from dfx version <0.13, you have to use an identity that was generated (referring to `dfx identity new`, not `dfx identity import`) with dfx <0.12. If you revert to e.g. dfx 0.11.3 to generate another identity, you can use both with ic-admin

Also: my bad for not documenting this properly. I thought the next dfx release would come much sooner, so I didn't document this weird behaviour properly.

-------------------------

mindfulanon | 2023-01-24 19:02:29 UTC | #9

 I'm glad I'm getting help! Thank you for the detailed explanation.

I have now selected my default identity, which I created <0.12 and now the following message comes up

![grafik|690x107](upload://5hJgHtzNBLQpCCsK4rrvb7to2Md.png)

How to authorize my identity?

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-01-25 07:34:47 UTC | #10

I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing. I'll ask around and if I don't answer within a day or so, feel free to ping me again.

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-01-25 09:50:54 UTC | #11

The team says the error comes from [this check](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/dfinity/ic/-/blob/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs?L5559) and that likely the error is that you forgot to add the developer identity as a hotkey to the neuron you're trying to propose with. That would be step 2.7.5 with the current version of the [instructions](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/get-sns/local-testing).

Thank you so much, that worked!

The error message `invalid type: string "0,", expected u64` gives a hint. If you search for `"0,"`, it'll point you to the second last line, where you have `memo: "0,"`. Change this to a valid u64 (e.g. `534`, then it should work. If you want to compare, [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/e2e/assets/sns/valid/sns.yml) is a valid `sns.yml`.

`expected u64 at line 1 column 20`
The wrong location indicator is probably because of some parsing library that gets called recursively.

-------------------------

mindfulanon | 2023-01-25 12:55:20 UTC | #14

Wow yes right that solved it!

I am now running into: 
```
Argument list too long (os error 7)', rs/sns/cli/src/main.rs:337:29
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

I tried the whole thing with the sample version you sent me and other principal IDs but I still get the same error so it can't be the yaml file probably. @Severin

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-01-25 13:04:35 UTC | #15

This is a limitation of bash/your shell, see [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30650841/why-am-i-getting-errno-7-argument-list-too-long-and-oserror-errno-24-too-ma).

Since this didn't happen on my machine (macOS with zsh), and not on CI (both macOS and Ubuntu, not sure which shells they use), I'd recommend you try with a different shell.

Can you also tell me which shell you're using? I'd like to reproduce this on CI so we can figure out a way to circumvent that limit and also make sure we test for it.

-------------------------

mindfulanon | 2023-01-25 15:34:03 UTC | #16

I was using /bin/bash. I'm trying other shells right now, but can't find the right one yet.

Which should I use?

@Severin

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-01-26 07:25:57 UTC | #17

I'm not sure, I guess you'll have to try it out. I know that on my machine zsh works well. Maybe it is also possible to somehow adjust the max parameter length?

-------------------------

mindfulanon | 2023-02-09 11:33:10 UTC | #18

I tried that and also tried to increase the parameters length but I'm still stuck to this day. Is there anything else I can try? @Severin

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-02-09 12:06:05 UTC | #19

I'll ping the team, maybe they have an idea that works without code changes. Otherwise someone would have to do something like [this PR](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/2787) that added support for an argument file. Feel free to ping me again if you don't receive help within a few days.

bitdivine | 2023-02-09 12:25:43 UTC | #20

Hello @mindfulanon .  May I ask which version of bash?  Just checking as Mac ships with a version that is over a decade old and a _lot_ goes wrong with it.

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-03-02 13:58:09 UTC | #25

Hello.  Apologies for the delay in responding.  Would you be available for a call?  Maybe we can get an SNS working for you fully in half an hour or so, that might be much better than async.  Which timezone are you in?  What times are typically good for you?

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-03-06 12:52:09 UTC | #26

Another thing that may help:  There is [an automated demo](https://github.com/dfinity/snsdemo) that goes through the whole process of setting up an SNS.  The repo is slowly becoming deprecated and the README has long since been moved to the link you are following above but the code in the snsdemo is tested in CI, and the flow there is known to work with the latest SNS.  If you have the whole flow working in CI you may be able to spot where the behaivour is different from the results you are seeing locally.

-------------------------

mindfulanon | 2023-03-06 16:31:06 UTC | #27

Hey, that would be awesome and I think a call with you would help the most. My time zone is CET/MEZ. It suits me best in the morning on Monday or Tuesday from the time 10-14. If it doesn't suit you there, please tell me your times!

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-03-07 12:41:06 UTC | #28

I had a closer look.  I believe that the parse error is actually from failing to parse a response from the IC.

I had a run through the document.  There is a step missing,  if I am not mistaken.  After the `dfx nns install` the `nns-sns-wasm` canister is still uninitialized; it needs wasms to deploy when it creates the SNS.  In the `snsdemo` repo this is accomplished with the two commands `dfx-sns-wasm-download
&& dfx-sns-wasm-upload` that get the wasms from dfinity and upload them to the local canister.  If I execute those two steps then the `dfx sns deploy` works.  Let's still meet to make sure that you get through the whole process.  Nothing is less helpful than someone else saying "it works for me".

On our side we can update the document or, better, include the wasm upload in `dfx nns install`.

Also, it looks as if the dsale proposal command needs to be updated.  We can cover that in the call  and then get the manual updated.

These are the commands I ran:
```
Check identities:
* Majority stakeholder
* Developer id has a pem file
* Network settings

==========
I needed a developer identity so ran:
dfx identity new --storage-mode plaintext developer-identity


=========

dfx start --clean --background
dfx nns import
dfx sns import
dfx ledger balance --identity nns-ledger-default-identity
# These two steps are missing.  I added the snsdemo repo bin dir to my path to run them:
dfx-sns-wasm-download
dfx-sns-wasm-upload


# Get developer neuron ID
export DEVELOPER_NEURON_ID=<neuron id>
# Add this hotkey to the neuron
dfx --identity developer-identity identity get-principal

$(dfx cache show)/ic-admin --secret-key-pem ~/.config/dfx/identity/$(dfx identity whoami)/identity.pem --nns-url "http://localhost:$(dfx info replica-port)" propose-to-update-sns-deploy-whitelist --added-principals "$(dfx identity get-wallet)" --proposer "$DEVELOPER_NEURON_ID" --proposal-title "Let me SNS!" --summary "I am friendly."
# Now open a browser and in the nns-dapp, vote as the majority neuron.  Neeed to adjust the filter on the proposals page to show SNS proposals.
dfx --identity developer-identity ledger fabricate-cycles --canister $(dfx identity get-wallet) --t 2345
dfx --identity developer-identity wallet balance


cp ../snsdemo/logo.png ../snsdemo/sns.yml .
dfx sns deploy

# The sale proposal is now with ic-admin.  I believe that sns dsale is deprecated.
dfx-sns-sale-propose --neuron $DEVELOPER_NEURON_ID

# Now vote as the majority neuron.

# Got to the launchpad and refresh.  You should see the sale open.  Note:  IRL, there is a minimum 1-day delay between the proposal passing and the sale opening.
```

Regarding "argument list too long" - this turned out to be because the logo was too large.  A 200kb image encoded as text so probably a 270000 character long command line.  The tool probably needs to pass in the logo in a different way or enforce a maximum size so that the user knows what went wrong.
