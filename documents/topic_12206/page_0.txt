Much of this is taken from https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-introduce-an-incubation-period-and-minimum-support-threshold-for-governance-proposals/12220 which I like, but consider to be too complex and involve too many moving parts in the short term. I'm putting this forward because I think it could be implemented quickly by DFINITY.  Thanks for the format @justmythoughts 
## Objectives

* Decrease incentives to submit spam governance proposals
* Protect the NNS from censorship, and preserve the current accessibility of submitting NNS governance proposals (i.e. does not increase the cost or difficulty of submitting an NNS proposal).
* Protect NNS voters from governance proposal spam

**Note** : In this post, all references to “proposal” refer to **all proposals**, those could be restricted to governance proposals, but I don't think that is necessary.

## Solution

* Update the NNS app to not show proposals that have not at least met the 3%(or modified) threshold of Yes votes required to pass.
* Update the NNS canister to skip rewarding proposals that have not received at least 3%(or modified) threshold of Yes votes.
* Update the NNS canister to extend the end date to match the initial voting period when the proposal passes the 3%(or modified) Yes vote proposal.

## Implementation for  Proposed Solution

After line 6027( [ https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/79bbd3177f6532037eb29d62b3e52a364a8103ee/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6027 ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/79bbd3177f6532037eb29d62b3e52a364a8103ee/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6027) ) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudocode below:

```
if( proposal.tally.yes/proposal.tally.total < MIN_NUMBER_VOTES_FOR_PROPOSAL_RATIO){continue;}
```

After line 5274(https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/35acac6c1113a23e2cb92329f1431c5254567e6e/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L5274) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudo code below:

```
let oldYesRatio = proposal.tally.yes / proposal.tally.total;
```

After line 5284(https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/35acac6c1113a23e2cb92329f1431c5254567e6e/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L5284) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudo code below:

```
If (proposal.tally.yes / proposal.tally.total >= 0.3 and oldYeRation <0.3){proposal. deadline_timestamp_seconds = deadline_timestamp_seconds + (now() - proposal.proposal_time_stamp_seonds);
```

After line 158(https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/e9dd304d8aaa96f82e91936f23d1bf0c781ae9c5/frontend/svelte/src/routes/Proposals.svelte#L158), wrap line 159 in:

```
{if proposalInfo.tally.yes/ [propsalInfo.tally.no](http://propsalInfo.tally.no) < ($UserConfiguredMinYesThreshold | 0.3)}
    Line 159
{/if}
```

The NNS front app team will need to add a widget to allow for changing the UserConfiguredMinYesThreshold and storing the preferred value in webStorage.

## How does this affects me as an NNS voter?

* Voters have no obligation to vote on a proposal until it reaches a 3% threshold of yes votes.
* Once the 3% yes threshold is reached, voters should vote or follow a voter to claim rewards(No change)

## Why this proposal works

* NNS Participants only view and vote on spam proposals because they are required to. Not voting results in lost governance rewards, which are then directly split amongst those who do vote on the spam proposal. Introducing an incubation period and minimum support threshold removes the requirement to view and vote on each and every proposal that hits the NNS.
* Since NNS Voters are no longer required to vote for proposals that can't meet the threshold, each proposal must reach the 3% yes minimum support threshold on its own merits and value proposition in order to receive attention from the whole community.
* This proposal does not increase the proposal creation or rejection cost, and therefore does not impose a greater financial burden on NNS Proposal Creators.
* Extending the time period at the point of crossing the 3% threshold keeps the consideration time the same.

## Additional Benefits of this proposal

* Adding a minimum support threshold allows governance proposals to be visible on the NNS for a longer period of time, ensuring that less active NNS voters have the opportunity to vote for incubated proposals they support.
* Adding a minimum support threshold encourages NNS proposal creators to advertise, receive feedback, and iterate upon their proposals before submitting in order to ensure they will pass the 3% support threshold and proceed to a live vote on the NNS.

## NNS App UI Changes

* Add a slider to let users that want to see votes under the threshold if they want to.
* Make sure a proposer create can hotlink directly to a vote so they have something to use when they promote their proposal.(I think you can already do this..ie https://nns.ic0.app/#/proposal/55168, but if you are not authorized you lose your redirect...I think this is an easy fix)

## Arguments Against/Potential Issues

1. This will not stop the current spammer from submitting NNS Proposals.

**Rebuttal to (1)** : Looking at one of the recent spam proposals by @ysyms, [Internet Computer Network Status](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/54543), we can see that only 0.2% of the total voting power is voting to accept these NNS proposals. This means that this would never be shown to most people, the vote would fail and the spammer would be charged their 1 ICP.  It would not affect rewards

![Screen Shot 2022-04-16 at 17.29.29](upload://fcyf3EmTsc5tvV77lYEvROqZj5B)

Keep in mind that even for some of the spam NNS proposals that garnered more than 3% of the vote, many of these votes were novelty votes that were only cast because the item was visible. If the proposer had been forced to garner social momentum the likely would not have reached the threshold

2. It may be possible that more than 3% of the overall NNS voting power would be interested in continuing spam proposals for financial benefit.

**Rebuttal to (2)** : If more than 3% of the overall NNS voting power support a spam attack, increasing the proposal cost would have little to no effect. There are two potential solutions in this scenario.

* Further raise the minimum support threshold for governance proposals
* Fix the amount of governance rewards disbursed to be on a weekly basis, as mentioned in solution 3 of [Community Discussion: Revise Governance Voting Rewards to Fix Proposal Spamming Rewards Exploit](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915)

3. As an NNS Proposal submitter, I feel like this minimum support threshold places an additional financial burden on me to submit proposals to the NNS.

**Rebuttal to (3)** : The proposed solution **does not** change proposal submission costs for NNS creators. If one is submitting a proposal that they do not feel will receive the minimum support threshold by a voluntary vote, then they should advertise their proposal and timeline on the forums and social media (Twitter, DSCVR, Distrikt) to garner the necessary support before submitting a proposal to the NNS. If a proposal cannot reach 3% voluntary support, it’s unlikely that proposal will achieve a majority of voting power and pass when it goes live.

## Discussion Lead

@skilesare

Thanks to @justmythoughts for doing all the work here on the formatting. I think that proposal is a great long term proposal as an incubation period is great for discussion, etc...but they could be spammy as well and now we have to look at them for 2 weeks. :joy:

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-16 17:54:02 UTC | #2

Interesting idea on making proposals quiet until the proposal lead generates enough Yes support to open the proposal to everyone.  I suppose that would advantage whales who can quickly generate that threshold of support, but maybe it's worth flushing out further.

I think it is a hard sell to convince people to not vote for something if that results in lower voting rewards for them compared to voting for it.  Hence, I would avoid taking this idea in that direction.

It's hard for me to tell because there are so many ideas people have presented with a lot of comments, but it is possible that someone is working on something along these lines.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-16 19:24:19 UTC | #3

They can vote, just vote reject if they think it is spam. We are all doing that anyway. Maybe @Kyle_Langham cam do an amlysis.of hoany of the spam proposals would have become visible, adjusted for the liklyhood that most would not have seen it.

Maybe wait for quiet kicks in as soon as you pass 3% yes.

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-04-16 20:25:09 UTC | #4

Thank you for the suggestion but in my opinion any limitations in visibility of proposals and restrictions on who can vote to limited group(s) are opposite of decentralisation.

For this reasons I'm suggesting to **cancel the proposal `Rejection Cost` and relace it with `Spam Rejection Cost`**,  where the **cost would be significantly increased and Spam would be identified by more than 50% of votes (check box `Is Spam` with every proposal, equivalent option for cli...).**
(rejection cost was meant to be spam rejection cost anyways)

**In my opinion this would even encourage serious proposers as there would be no cost of good-faith (discussed here etc) rejected proposals.
Spam would be gone due to high `Spam Rejection Cost`,  and would be decided by whole community via simple click during voting (or adding `--is-spam` on cli)**

skilesare | 2022-04-16 20:52:35 UTC | #5

My concern about a spam rejection cost is is that it can be used as a sword to attempt to punish. I prefer financial ploughshares.

I'd argue(with moderate conviction) that if your really interested in decentralization of the IC, your battle is in finding a way to distribute ICP to non-current holders. I don't know that the NNS and voting the right arena for that.

My proposal takesno votes away from anyone as any activated proposal must be presented to all voters.

It punishes no one but does raise the price of an activated proposal in the currency of social capital which seems to be the developing resource driving crypto communities.

As someone who woke up on the wrong side of a whale voter and had a couple non-spam proposals rejected when there was 0 evidence beforehand that they would be(or at least with the first one) I'm a bit sensitive to the reality that this world throws curve balls at you and it is an absolute possibilty that if you give someone a gun they are equally likely to shoot you with it as they are to defend them selves from evil in the world.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-16 20:57:04 UTC | #6

Edited the proposal to include wait for quite when a proposal pases 3% yes.

The entire NNS is designed to benefit the largest stakeholders that can organize. I've updated the proposal with @justmythoughts rebuttal to this point.

10 ICP is a fine number and about what it used to cost when the price was up at $85/ICP.  I'm fine with a bit higher number, I prefer to denominate it in XDR so it is constant.  The point of spam is to get your attention and expose you to something.  By requiring a spam vote you are giving the spammer what they want.  From my inbox I can see that spammers are willing to spend a lot to get my attention.

> * **NNS and voting is exactly the place where decentralization happens** , what you’re suggesting (in quoted text) is close to (Lenin’s) communism - I was born&living in it and won’t vote for it (ever)

There is social decentralization, governance decentralization, and financial decentralization. We can talk about the merits of all of them.  There are certainly extremes and 20th-century communism has certainly been shown to be a boob and barb of a concept.  There is still a lot of ground to explore in the middle between financial oligarchy and just airdropping everyone an equal amount of tokens.  The answer is in the middle there is somewhere where the market can bring its power to the economic arena and people's rights and chances at opportunity can be honored.  Right now the NNS is too centralized...I think we mostly agree with that.  I'd just like to explore how you can modify the tokenomics to make sure that new entrants have a chance at opportunity as well.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 03:59:08 UTC | #11

i think all of this would be easily fixed by a filter/sort function in the NNS app which is a simple fix on the web front end.... let users decide thresholds for themselves.

if i want to see virgin proposals with 0 votes then let me, if i only want to see stuff that has 10% engagement or higher then let me do that, if i just want to see proposals that are about to close in 60 minutes let me see those......  this shouldn't be dictated to folks.

hiding information even if some people consider it "spam" is not smart...

i'm not sure setting a minimum level of voter engagement in order to pay out rewards is a good idea.  we want people engaged even if they have to vote "no" to what they think is spam or a stupid idea.

[quote="superduper, post:11, topic:12206"]

[/quote]

I think you are right about the filters being a good idea. The gotcha here is that without a proposal to not reward for votes unless they reach a threshold of yes votes means that you **have** to pay attention and vote.  If the filter matches the level at which you need to care then you never need to care about things that are filtered out.

I'd disagree that this is anything close to "hiding" information.  For the proposal to go into effect it has to be seen.  Also, there is too much information in the world to not hide some things. Our entire brains are abstraction machines that hide information inside of reasonable topics so we can all talk about them.  

Regardless, this proposal gives all users the ability to see everything if they want to.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 04:02:22 UTC | #13

it's in the economic interest of anyone who can reach or help reach this 3% to vote, even if they have to write a script to vote no each time.

in which case if they are not voting to ensure they maximize their profits they are not rational actors

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-17 04:07:57 UTC | #14

My proposal is for a 3% YES threshold.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but if items that don't reach a 3% yes threshold do not figure into rewards, then why vote on them?  They are safe to ignore.

Are you arguing that with the current set up it is advantageous for us all to vote at least 3% Yes so we get more rewards?  I guess that is possible.  Perhaps this proposal needs to be adjusted to remove the massive bonus for governance proposals.  Would that remove the incentive to vote with a spammer just to get the proposal "on the books".

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 04:12:15 UTC | #15

so someone could spam "do you want to get paid your governance reward today and maximize your profits?"

a rational actor would vote yes, as they would make more money.  only an irrational actor would vote no or not vote.

or

"vote yes if you think this is spam?"

then anyone who votes no or doesn't vote their next votes should be discounted (weigh less) as they clearly are not rational thinkers... lol

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 04:14:32 UTC | #16

u can monetize the identification of spam  by identifying users who can't or won't read, or who can't think rationally

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 04:19:40 UTC | #17

also if you reward people for yes votes, then people will skew to vote yes by default to reach the 3% to get paid more

[/quote]

Yeah...I think this is tied to the fact that governance proposals have a multiplier. We should probably remove those and even the reward weights all back out to 1 or this will continue to be a problem.(https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/79bbd3177f6532037eb29d62b3e52a364a8103ee/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L1496 <- code that does the calculation).

I think that is a separate issue though...or should I add it to this one?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-17 04:21:30 UTC | #19

The issue here is that even if we get rid of the direct financial incentive to spam, we still have the indirect(I want something seen by a bunch of people).  Admittedly this proposal addresses the second one more than the first.  I think if you fix the first, this one also fixes the second.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 04:22:33 UTC | #20

i think in general you want more engagement not less, so lowering that would lower the engagement.

i don't see what that guy is doing as spam btw i see it as someone acting rationally given the design of the system. he is adding value for himself and others.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-04-17 04:28:34 UTC | #21

also the weights i think work such that they will optimize at a certain amount of proposals per day after which the marginal increase will be such that "spam" wont really be seen (assuming there is a simple voter engagment lvl filter)

for example if there are 20 legit proposals in a day adding one extra spam proposal will not increase the rewards much hence it wont be worth economically to spam, hence it will not be rational for him to spam anymore... unless he just want to be heard by some subset of ppl

so i dont think u need to worry about this in the long term, assuming of course that governance proposals engagement increases with the expansion of the network

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-17 04:29:22 UTC | #22

Decentralization progress will reverse if proposal weights are reverted back to 1.  Why not focus on removing the discrepancy between how many people vote on governance and how many people vote in all topics except governance.  Financial incentives for spam will go away if we incentivize everyone to intentionally select their Followees and re-confirm them periodically.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-17 04:47:05 UTC | #23

Glad you liked my proposal :slight_smile: 

I really like your adaptation and the ideas presented in this proposal, and honestly feel the version you've presented here would be the best combination of easy to implement as a short term solution + effective in combating spam proposals while achieving the objectives listed at the top of the proposal.

[/quote]

I agree that my proposal is more of a long term one given the backend changes, and would probably take on the order of a month to a quarter to implement.

One thing I may not have made clear in my proposal would be that the "incubating" proposals would be listed in a separate view, such that an NNS voter would not be required to by the UI or financially incentivized to look at them. An NNS voter would need to actively search out incubating proposals. Think about it like the difference between your twitter feed (live proposals), and actively searching for a new person or tweet (incubating proposals).

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-04-17 08:41:52 UTC | #24

Well, possibly we won't agree on the process but that's not important.

Last thing I forgot to mention is, that my intention is to keep the solution as simple as possible because `SNS` will likely mimic the same - I believe a check box `Is Spam` (or `--is-spam` cli opt) adds only minimal (close to zero) administration.

Also with `Rejection Cost` replaced by `Spam Rejection Cost` we could even increase the amount if needed, still allowing serious community members to make governance proposals (the `Cost` wouldn't be burned in case of simple/non-spam rejection).

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-04-17 09:24:51 UTC | #25

But reading the latest spam proposal, actually this might not help as well :slightly_frowning_face: 
`It looks like at least increasing the rejection cost of the proposal to 2000 ICP would stop me outright.`
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55152

So may be suggestion from @wpb will be the best option:

wpb | 2022-04-17 17:14:10 UTC | #26

After reading through this proposal again, I think it only works for spam that are presented for the purpose of advertisement and announcement and only if there is already no incentive for spam proposals for the purpose of financial gain.  

I can’t be an advocate for removing proposal weights to remove financial incentives for spam because I think that is the primary tool that has caused an increase in participation in governance proposals, and therefore advanced governance decentralization.  

In order for this proposal to be effective, people have to be unencumbered from the financial decision.  I don’t think that will happen.  The primary reason these spam proposals are happening is because there are financial incentives to make them.  Hence, expecting people take the higher ground by ignoring them seems unlikely.  This paradigm is also a problem for public neurons.  If ICPMN, ICDevs, or cycledao were to ignore these proposals, then followers would just seek new neurons who are willing to vote in ways that achieve the highest rewards for them.  

I think we need to create conditions where the “right” answer is also the most economically advantaged answer, which to me means that all informed decisions made individually and through liquid democracy need to result in equal financial gain.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-17 13:49:43 UTC | #27

There seems to a broader question being overlooked in this discussion, which is 'what is a governance proposal?'.

At the moment the answer is: anything that is submitted as a governance proposal. As @wpb first demonstrated (kudos) even purely informational motions - accept/reject does not affect the outcome - that are classified as governance become eligible for higher rewards.

Within the group of not-governance proposals, there are null objects, informational objects with good intent, others with bad intent, and maybe some that are better submitted under another topic, to name a few possible categories.

My point of view, as usual, is that you can't manage all the motivations behind these different types of non-governance proposals with a system that is designed to reward governance proposals. It either distorts the governance reward systems, making it less good as doing what it should, or fails to address one or more types of non-governance proposal, pushing the problem around instead of solving it all the while making the governance system more complex or harder to use.

On top of this, the governance reward system is constantly under review, making 8-year investors rather twitchy, because their locked-up ICP is subject to fluctuating conditions - not a good basis for any contractual agreement.

[/quote]

Do you think returning back to an even weighting would reduce that participation? Or do you think that we just have more ground to make up and that we need to leave it in place? Just trying to understand your position. I think any imbalance in weight in will cause this problem.(absent other adjustments.)

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-17 17:44:08 UTC | #29

I would argue that the imbalance that we have right now is not the proposal weights.  When I stop to think about the weights, they feel right.  There is no way that exchange rate proposals should be valued the same as governance proposals, especially since there are 144 of them every day.  

Instead, I argue that the imbalance is the participation rate.  I think there is too much satisfaction in the community with treating ICP tokenomics like a security.  It is not stock in a company.  It is a governance token and is supposed to incentivize people to participate.  We have to earn those rewards…we are not entitled to those rewards.  Yet we have over half the voting power not participating in governance and still getting rewarded for participating by way of default configuration of their neuron.  I believe this is the imbalance that is causing the spam proposals.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-17 23:02:54 UTC | #30

We can debate whether this is good or bad, but Origyn rewards for having voted during a 24 hour period. As of now, we do not have a difference between proposal types, but that is coming. If there are 15 proposals in a 24 hour period and you vote on one of them, you get the whole reward.  We are more of an industry-focused blockchain, so we expect most votes to be via liquid democracy.  We don't expect users will make the minimum effort because for example, we expect the luxury group to follow other industries outside of luxury because they know those groups can better govern themselves.  The general philosophy is that like the specialization of labor in a marketplace, specialization of governance produces a much healthier governance structure than maximum participation.  As long as we provide for the ability for people to jump into the fray when it does become relevant to them, most of the time it is advantageous for them to delegate votes to those who "know what they are doing."

I'd like to see the NNS do the same.  I think rewarding for having participated to a minimum threshold should qualify for the whole reward. This can be generalized to require that the user has voted for(or had a delegate vote) at least one proposal in all eligible categories during the rewards period. There is still a possibility of spam up to n=1 for each category, but expanding the window to 1 week instead of 1 day might get us to an n of 1 in each category.

Hmm....You may underestimate the damage one of those exchange rate proposals slipping through the cracks could disrupt the economics of the IC. If one user were to get one through they could produce a trillionty cycles and undermine the entire deflationary mechanism. They are very, very important.  They are certainly more important that "Temp Check" proposals.  I'd argue that having different weights violates the complexity principle and makes things too complicated for most users(although it has been great for increasing participation in the short term."

Unless I am mistaken, this change would give first refusal to all manual voters. If they all vote to reject a proposal it will never make it to the NNS, though I guess it wouldn't matter if the % of manual voting is much higher than 3%. In fact, that number seems crucial in understanding the amount of risk with this route.

@skilesare What is current % of manual voting? Are there any stats you can show that help with this?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-19 13:11:37 UTC | #34

I think @Kyle_Langham would be able to answer this much better than me. I know that when ICDevs votes it trigger about 7 million votes. I would imagine ICPMNS and cycle_dao are  much higher than that.

But yes, your conclusion is correct. After the vote change mechanic goes into effect it would be easier for usual followers to change votes after lobbying by proposal creators.

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-19 14:13:35 UTC | #35

When I checked a few weeks ago, I calculated that there was about 49M votes being cast manually.

Update the NNS app to not show proposals that have not at least met the 3%(or modified) threshold of Yes votes required to pass.

I didn't find this answered in your proposal: If I don't see proposals below the 3% threshold, how do proposal ever reach the 3% threshold?

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-22 01:04:29 UTC | #37

The same reason，I think this plan is very bad 

1. Do you know the state of the NNS before the weight of the motion proposal was increased? You can check it out, [NNS Proposal ID 34839 (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34839) In fact, Not even 2% engagement without great incentives,Even less likely to reach a 3% approval rating

2. If you look at the voting curve of the motion proposal, you can see that many people actually have more than 3% of the voting weight, and setting a 3% threshold will only give certain people privileges

3. It cannot solve the reward problem, I only need to change the content, you can let the whales have enough reasons to support my proposal to get the benefits. You can check my early proposal

4. It cannot solve the Attack proposal. If most voters will view the incubation-based proposal, then the latency design does not solve any problems, it will still become the broadcast of the community,
If most voters do not need to see the incubation proposal. The incubation proposal will only be manipulated by the giant whale. (34839 proposal forum post has more than 200 replies, there is no 2% participation)

## NNS App UI Changes

* Add a slider to let users that want to see votes under the threshold if they want to.
* Make sure a proposer create can hotlink directly to a vote so they have something to use when they promote their proposal.(I think you can already do this…ie [Internet Computer Content Validation Bootstrap](https://nns.ic0.app/#/proposal/55168), but if you are not authorized you lose your redirect…I think this is an easy fix)
[/quote]

@jwiegley 

I think this might answer your question. From what I interpret, the NNS voter would have the slider set by default to the 3% threshold (minimum required for a proposal to pass). 

Anything under that would not be visible unless the NNS voter lowers the threshold to 2%, 1%, or 0% (all proposals).

There could then be a hotlink or a search functionality like [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651), where the user just puts in the ID of the proposal (i.e. 55651) and it attempts to take me to `https://nns.ic0.app/v2/#/proposal/<proposalID>`, and if not found returns a not found error. Or I can just link to [https://nns.ic0.app/v2/#/proposal/55651](https://nns.ic0.app/v2/#/proposal/55651) as long as I'm logged in to the NNS.

All of this search/hotlink functionality seems to be in place. In fact, when I try to navigate to [https://nns.ic0.app/v2/#/proposal/59999](https://nns.ic0.app/v2/#/proposal/59999) (which does not yet exist), I already get an error in the NNS app.

![Screen Shot 2022-04-21 at 18.14.25|690x82](upload://81ayHImxofaY44fdhA2aCXNc9SV.png)


From what I see all of these changes can be handles by the frontend only (no backend changes necessary, even for the search/hotlink).

skilesare | 2022-04-22 04:17:18 UTC | #39

Well…most people won’t  see them…at first. You are damn sure @wpb will see it! 

As far as getting to 3%, you’ll likely have to do some prep work politicking, and generally getting feedback from voters that will make your proposal better and more likely to pass.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-22 04:26:44 UTC | #40

I appreciate your attack at the extremes of what is possible, but I think it misses the mark of how humans will actually behave. Can whales push a proposal over the threshold? Of course! That is how skin in the game incentives work.

If someone with that much riding on the success of the IC votes yes for something, I want to see it. If no whale will vote for a how is the weather today post, or all reject, then no one else needs to see it either. It is a low bar to get over. 

The rewards issue is a harder one to solve and I have made proposals elsewhere to address that. This just tries to keep porn off the front page without punishing anyone.

MrPink13 | 2022-04-22 18:57:45 UTC | #41

I am against any proposal that attempts to change the current flow of NNS proposals. Anything that gives weight, hides, or creates barriers for actual valid proposals no matter how small the barrier should not be considered. I am under the impression that before giving governance proposals more weight the NNS was very well balanced. Designed and fine tuned to the nanometer. We disrupted that ecosystem by changing a core aspect of how the system operates.

Static mechanisms that rely on unmanned levers, weight systems, pulleys, scales, switches, etc only create a slippery slope of more mechanisms to try and catch inevitable pressurized errors.

The NNS is a living breathing ecosystem and valid proposals/stimuli should be processed as is now. Lets say a small group of niche specialists want to submit an important proposal for change. A proposal only .5% of the population will understand and let alone vote on. If it arrives to the NNS without any barriers its much easier to vote on within that small group of specialized neurons. Creating a threshold barrier would force that group to canvas themselves to the masses for adoption who will only see gibberish or cater to larger nuerons for adoption (corporate entities) or cater to publicly known neurons or humans for adoption (politicians/media). Were recreating the same bureaucracy were trying to get away from. This is now very black and white for me at this time. We must revert back to original settings and set up a system that uses only what is already in place to control for spam. Nothing new that changes how valid proposals are organized. Valid proposals are valid no matter what. We cannot allow valid proposals to be hidden away.

This 0.5% can't get anything passed.  They have to have at least 3% understand it enough to vote yes.  I agree that things were better before and I think we should revert to all proposals being valued the same.  I think it is the only way to not have to create an overcomplicated system.

This proposal just creates a threshold that something that can't get 3% shouldn't figure into rewards at all.  Take away the hiding aspect of the proposal and consider just the suggestion to not figure any proposal that can't get at least 3% to count toward rewards.  That is no different than the old system and just makes sure that you can ignore trash proposals and not vote on them as opposed to voting no.

I can amend the proposal as such.  See below:

```
Motion to restrict rewards qualification to a threshhold

Objectives:

Decrease incentives to submit spam governance proposals
Protect the NNS from censorship, and preserve the current accessibility of submitting NNS governance proposals (i.e. does not increase the cost or difficulty of submitting an NNS proposal).
Allow NNS voters to ignore spam

Note : In this post, all references to “proposal” refer to all proposals, those could be restricted to governance proposals, but I don’t think that is necessary.

Solution

Update the NNS canister to skip rewarding proposals that have not received at least the Minimum threshold of Yes votes required to pass threshold of Yes votes(currently 3%).
Update the NNS canister to extend the end date to match the initial voting period when the proposal passes threshold of Yes votes required to pass Yes vote proposal.

Implementation for Proposed Solution

But can you do better by only changing 4 lines of code ;)

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-23 15:01:33 UTC | #45

If I can get general agreement that we should not reward proposals that cannot reach the 3% threshold ofaccept votes I’ll tear down the proposal to remove anything about the UI except a recommendation that is a NNS UI providers offer a filter similar to the hide votes I’ve already voted on filter that is in the NNS now. This will read something like add a filter to “hide any proposals that have not reached a reward threshold.” It will be 100% up to the user to decide to turn this on or off.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-23 20:20:23 UTC | #46

Here is the amended language:

# Motion to restrict rewards qualification to a threshold

## Objectives:

Decrease incentives to submit spam governance proposals
Protect the NNS from censorship, and preserve the current accessibility of submitting NNS governance proposals (i.e. does not increase the cost or difficulty of submitting an NNS proposal).
Allow NNS voters to ignore spam

Note: In this post, all references to “proposal” refer to all proposals, not just governance propsals.

## Solution

This solution only requires the editing of 3 lines of code.

Update the NNS canister to skip rewarding proposals that have not received at least the Minimum threshold of Yes votes required to pass the threshold of Yes votes(currently 3%).

Example:  

Proposal A: Final tally 2% of the total voting power to accept, 45% of total voting power reject - Proposer is charged a fee and the proposal is NOT considered for rewards.
Proposal B: Final tally 4% of total voting power to accept, 45% of the total voting power to reject - Proposer is charged a fee and the proposal IS considered for rewards.
Proposal C: Final tally 40% of total voting power to accept, 10% of the total voting power to reject - Proposer is NOT charged a fee and the proposal IS considered for rewards.
Proposal D: Final tally 2% of total voting power to accept, 1% of total voting power to reject - Proposer IS charged the reject fee and the proposal is NOT considered for rewards. Proposal is rejected as it is today.

Update the NNS canister to extend the end date to match the initial voting period when the proposal passes the threshold of Yes votes required to pass the proposal.

Example. If a 4-day proposal passes the 3% yes on the 3rd day, it will be extended for 3 more days so that gets the original 4 days of exposure to the broadest set of voters.

## Implementation of Proposed Solution

After line 6027( https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/79bbd3177f6532037eb29d62b3e52a364a8103ee/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6027 ) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudocode below:

After line 5274(ic/governance.rs at 35acac6c1113a23e2cb92329f1431c5254567e6e · dfinity/ic · GitHub) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudo code below:

Implementation Note: Unsuccessful proposals will still be charged the reject fee even if the proposal is not included in reward calculations

## Recommendation

This proposal also recommends, but does not require that NNS frontends implement a filter to "Only show proposals that have met the reward threshold." This filter should be off by default and only selected at the user's discretion.

## Voting

Accept: To vote Yes (Accept) means you agree that the above code changes should be made.

Reject: To vote No (Reject) means you do not agree that the changes should be made."}}; neuron_id_or_subaccount=opt variant {NeuronId=record {id=12008772471346176261:nat64}}})'

Expected Outcome: There will be less incentive to submit spam/inappropriate proposals as it they will be unlikely to hit a 3% accept threshold without the significant organization of an attacking party of 3% of the NNS voting power.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-23 19:25:40 UTC | #47

Is there the tacit agreement that, if less than 3% vote on this, it will be nullified?

-------------------------

levi | 2022-04-23 20:16:49 UTC | #48

This would centralize the nns. If no one is rewarded for voting on new proposals unless they reach 3% yes, then most people will not want to vote on them or see them and it would be way harder almost impossible for someone who isn’t so well known to pass a proposal.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-23 20:17:15 UTC | #49

If less than 3% got on any proposal it is nullified even if it has more yes votes. I’ll add that scenario as an example.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-23 20:22:11 UTC | #50

Sure, later I can abstain. My question is whether this course of action will have an impact in this proposal, since the proposal is not yet passed :wink:

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-24 10:33:45 UTC | #51

Hi @skilesare, thanks for writing this idea up! I have one main concern wrt this proposal.

I think right now people pretty unanimously vote no on spam proposals, because they'll get the increased rewards anyway, and additionally the 10 ICP of the proposer will be burned if they reject. With your proposed change, the voters are now actually incentivized to vote yes on spam proposals, because if it reaches at least 3% yes, they will get boosted rewards. So I expect that many will vote with their own financial gains in mind, and that therefore all spam proposals will reach 3% yes, and the change you proposed will not have any effect.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-24 11:29:32 UTC | #52

@skilesare my opinion is similar to @Manu.  I think this proposal won’t work unless the incentive to ignore, abstain, or not vote yes is decoupled from financial gain that is offered by voting yes.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-24 13:43:57 UTC | #53

Hmmm…perhaps you are right, but also maybe you underestimate human cruelty. 😈

First I’ll say that this proposal isn’t independent of other solutions. Provided other solutions solve incentive problem, do you think this helps solves the “pay for publicity” problem for people that turn on the filter?

Second, It is an interesting question about incentives. Given the opportunity to reward my self immorally or punish someone else financially for bad behavior, what will people choose? I think it probably varies with stack size and the person.

As a small bag holder I actually think it benefits me more by burning 10ICP with no rewards given out than I do participating in inflation with everyone else. There is probably a bag size where this flips.

I guess it gets back to the problem is that people are already voting to take outsized rewards because of the heavy weighting to governance proposals.

It gets back to needing to reset the weight back to 1.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-24 13:55:28 UTC | #54

It also occurs to me that the need to get a boosted reward requires at least 1 proposal a day. A schedule of named neuron proposals could counteract this in the meantime and get us to a point where periodic confirmation can go into effect.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-24 17:36:32 UTC | #55

I’ve proposed https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-temporarily-reduce-governance-proposal-weight-to-1/12390?u=skilesare which would make this proposal safer in the short term. I’ll wait to see the response to it before moving forward with this one.
