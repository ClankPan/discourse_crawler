sorry to hijack your thread but i have no clue how to post my own topic ... crazy i know.

well I'm using the NNS and sent some coins to my address there, now i am trying to send some coins from that address but on the page where i input the amount there is no other button to press to make the transfer happen.

am i hallucinating or just plain stupid and cant see something super obvious??

any help appreciated

I think you click Review transaction and confirm the transfer. Are you seeing something different?
