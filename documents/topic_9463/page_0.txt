I want to use cycles-minting canister to deposit cycles to the particular canister but I am confused about the to_subaccount attribute. Has anyone used this interface? It would be better if there was an example. Thanks.
```
type TransactionNotification = record {
  to : principal;
  to_subaccount : opt vec nat8;
  from : principal;
  memo : nat64;
  from_subaccount : opt vec nat8;
  amount : ICPTs;
  block_height : nat64;
};
```
