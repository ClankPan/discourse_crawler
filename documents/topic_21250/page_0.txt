Hello all, 

I am writing this today because I have some concerns about projects like "Hot-or-Not" and how they are handling certain issues. One major problem is the overwhelming presence of "soft-core pornography" videos on the platform. These videos appear to be uploaded by fake or catfish accounts, which is a significant problem considering the foundation's goal of directly paying content creators for their work. Essentially, the platform has turned into a marketplace for stolen videos, allowing those who uploaded them to potentially profit while the original creators receive nothing. This not only taints the foundation's vision but also exposes the project to potential lawsuits and cease and desist orders. It could also attract attention from regulatory bodies like the FCC and SEC, which could lead to serious consequences for the project. 

Another issue I've noticed is that many of these videos are clearly stolen from the popular app TikTok, and they don't even attempt to hide the TikTok label. This is a clear infringement on copyright laws, and it's surprising to see that the application's community, developers, and content moderators take no action to prevent or remove such infringements. This lack of enforcement is a significant concern and highlights a disregard for copyright regulations.

Moreover, there's a possibility that this project could be considered an unregistered security offering. Although this is a topic of debate, I believe it's worth addressing the potential legal ramifications, particularly in highly regulated areas. While I am excited about the progress and potential of this technology, I feel that the community is too eager to launch and gain funding support without fulfilling their ethical obligations to the community, the projects they claim to develop for, and the original content creators. It's crucial for them to create effective safeguards for investors and content creators, but it seems they are neglecting these responsibilities.

I believe Coinbase US, Binance US, and other major exchanges might delist the ICP token until the legal situation surrounding these concerns is resolved. This would be a tragic outcome for me and other investors, as it would render our investments worthless unless we move to a location where selling the tokens is allowed without penalties. One possible workaround could be to swap the accumulated ICP on a decentralized exchange (DEX) with CkBTC or the upcoming CkETH, and then sell them on Coinbase as Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, this approach implies participating in a "tax-evasion-like scheme" in regulated areas, as DEXs currently do not provide adequate reporting to demonstrate the taxable event of swapping ICP for other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, it suggests engaging in transactions involving "unregistered securities" in areas where such ownership is not permitted, potentially leading to criminal offenses. This overlooked and underestimated issue is concerning, and I feel that both users and investors, especially in the US, are not giving it enough attention and consideration.

Overall, I want to clarify that I don't intend to diminish the progress made by the community in the IC ecosystem. However, I believe it's essential for current developers, investors, and community members to be less driven by excitement and impatience and instead hold themselves accountable for the biases and shortcomings present within the IC. The community needs to address these concerns and develop effective plans of action, rather than relying solely on the DFINITY foundation to handle legal matters. This reliance raises questions about the level of control and influence DFINITY has over the blockchain, and it's important to address these ethical concerns as well.

I agree. There are a lot of nuances that I think are being overlooked with hot or not and in the sales in general. Since the SNS launches are marketed as decentralization sales, but are just essentially buying stocks in incomplete products which can't be decentralized yet due to reliance on web2 services and other technicalities. 
These definitely seem more like securities than giving ownership of a product over to the community and rewarding work that's already been done through a sale. A decentralization sale, not a early stage funding round
We are in the wild West, which can be fun but also can hurt a lot of people who aren't looking at the fine details

Yes, I want to express that this is not limited to, "Hot-or-Not". However, the project is a good example. I would like to see any (all) projects being geo-blocked in the USA, and not allow any US investor in them (unless they are permitted to invest in unregistered securities). In my opinion, these concerns and "grey areas" are exactly why the SEC would feel urged to file charges for the list of tokens and coins.

This is not a surprise by any means I might add... Several community members (myself included) have alluded to these possibilities on several occasions and in several forum posts. However, it seems (on the surface) it is being outright ignored, and (or) unconsidered. 

I would like to see the community "do what it needs to do", for it to continuously be listed and sold on a variety of exchanges. Then, any services outside of the scope of the USA should be geo-blocked automatically, and those who wish to "risk" using a VPN to bypass the block should be slapped with a giant warning of sorts completely removing liability from the projects team/ community. However, this may (or does in some cases) directly violate the "censorship resistance" claims on the IC. It appears to be a "catch-22". 

Another, valuable nugget I keep thinking of, is how removing the sale and purchasing of ICP from the USA will not only hinder investor's ability to exit effectively. It will also block any (all) developers wishing to participate in a project. This is because, you can't fully deploy on the IC without purchasing and using cycles, which would require accumulating ICP tokens (which would be illegal in certain areas) making it impossible for even current developers to continue. Essentially, this *could* very well result in several individuals losing their jobs (income) entirely if they *only* are employed as a dev. on the IC. Personally, in my opinion, these are going to be highlighted in any case made. The SEC would essentially be forcibly "firing" x amount of law-abiding citizens/ employees. To me, that will be an infringement on the worker's rights, and *could* be interpreted as being unconstitutional. 

These things are well above my (and a vast majority of community members) "pay grade" as they say. So, this of course only points to various speculation(s), however, I have only seen "echoes" of known community members regarding these issues. While I applaud the conviction (possible blind faith), I do not see any discussions of real actionable steps or attempts to align itself accordingly. Just a "trust me bro" type of situation, along with no actual response from leadership addressing these issues or concerns. Which only leaves me with less conviction by the day. 

My hope is, that discussions and actionable plans are being made and ready to address these issues. Not only inside a sealed courtroom (until made public), but within the wider developing community. If troves of developers are essentially "fired". Not even being able to even accumulate cycles and continue their projects, then one could assume Cycles would lose any/ all monetary value and thus, resulting in a total collapse of the ICP token much like we saw in other well-known cases in the recent past. 

If it were up to my control, and I was the centralized party (Dfinity), I would think it would make sense to label the IC security, register it, pay for what it needs to do, and hope it recovers (of course this is in the event the USA does deem it as an unregistered security). Otherwise, if lawsuit(s) ends with centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance needing to register as brokers and follow the strict guidelines, then they *still* may not list the tokens again (or at least until they follow those guidlines in the USA).

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to hold this "thought exercise" of sorts, 

Best,

 PAYING TAXES IS AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. 

If someone sells an asset, they clearly know how much of a percentage they should pay to their jurisdictions. It’s upon them to make that choice of paying taxes and keep track on the numbers. 

Not long ago someone was making a comment about their career of doing repair work on real estate. The person mentioned that they often got paid in cash and that they kept track on the payments and then paid taxes appropriately according to their income. 
Which further supports my point that taxes are paid on an individual person basis. 

In our societies Billionaires pay different taxes from regular people; and in majority of the time the Billionaires pay way less taxes. Maybe our focus should pivot towards making everyone pay fair share in their taxes rather than micro targeting crypto investors.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-08 21:46:19 UTC | #5

I respect your opinion, however, I have to disagree. While, this *might* apply in certain geographic locations. It does *not* cover all. Nor does the real estate scenario apply to the scenarios I mention. Specifically, the developers not even being able to purchase cycles due to the lack of ability to purchase ICP tokens (legally). 

I understand your point of view, and while I may even agree with certain points, this is *only* in "hypotheticals", in practice this is not *some* of our realities, or even a plausible response to growing concerns. 

I understand that taxes are (to some) a "hot point". However, unfortunately, as we may soon see, this is not, nor would it ever be considered an "individual choice". Perhaps individuals' responsibility. However, labeling it as a "choice", is not only a dangerous precedent to set, it also opens a floodgate of potential legal consequences. While this may not be widely understood by all. I would urge you to (try) read(ing), the various criminal offenses and (or) charges associated with the acts I mentioned as a citizen of the USA.

Basically what you are saying is US CITIZENS needs to do ABC… 

The INTERNET COMPUTER is tailored to be a UNIVERSAL TOOL, it is not tailored to specifically satisfy US LAWS. 

US CITIZENS need to educate themselves on safe and appropriate practices while doing their taxes. 

Like I said before, the focus should rely on the tax regulators to EDUCATE THEIR SUBJECTS ON DOING TAXES APPROPRIATELY.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-08 22:00:09 UTC | #7

I do not believe you are quite understanding what I am saying, or the concerns I am raising. This undoubtedly goes beyond very basic tax reporting concepts. I am not saying US citizens need to ABC. I do not believe you are taking the appropriate time to fully understand or interpret the content. Perhaps, this is on me (poor delivery/ several different points not presented with concision). 

In more direct terms, this is not *just* about reporting on any earnings, this is about USA users, investors, and developers, not having *any* ability to buy, purchase, sell, or use ICP tokens period. IF any are owned, then in this scenario, your ICP tokens are essential, "Lost tokens". If the SEC is successful in their bid with Coinbase and Binance, and there are NO exchanges (in the USA) able to LEGALLY sell or purchase ICP tokens then no one (in the USA) would be able to effectively use any part of the IC ecosystem as the utility portion of the coin can no longer be used. 

I was attempting to use the "hot-or-not" project as an excellent case example. This project, unfortunately, already raises several red flags, yet is *still* being offered to the wider community in the USA. Despite it being a questionable security. This is not an "up to the user to DYOR" this is a standard requirement when even offering these projects (or investments) to the public. Not to mention the copyright issues mentioned above surrounding the obvious "tik-tok" labeled videos. I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a larger issue than it is currently. This is a perfect example of said violations of rules and regulations. 

While I may not *exactly* agree that they should be seen as securities, this is the "fine details" that are not to be taken lightly. They will if provoked, "throw the book at you", just to set a firm example for following cases. Especially, if it becomes a "hot topic" they will essentially destroy you.

You are the one who was talking about ICP being delisted from trading based on Tax issues.

And I was saying the society would be better if Billionaires paid their fair share in Taxes. I believe the regulators should do a better job on enforcing fair taxation among the Billionaires club. That would serve justice in the society and boost development in societies. 

My other suggestion was to educate the public on proper ways of doing taxes rather than preventing them from buying assets.

Not legal or financial advice. I'm not an accounting or legal expert.

I think you're having a very fatalistic view on crypto in the U.S. If Coinbase and Binance.us died tomorrow, the ability to use crypto and ICP in the U.S. wouldn't vanish. There are other exchanges the user would transition to. It just depends on how bad you want to use it. You can buy Bitcoin directly through Cash App if necessary. You can still use Kraken. I believe you can buy XLM through MoneyGram (haven't tried). Kucoin doesn't geoblock. Since it has been pretty widely accepted Bitcoin is not a security, all you have to do is buy it, send it to any exchange you want, and convert it to ICP or go right to ckBTC. That's all legal. Your coins are never "lost".

The SEC vs Ripple case has been going on over 2 years. Others companies have settled. IF the SEC decided to open a case against Dfinity for selling an unregistered security, it would be in court for years unless they settled. 

You can still buy XRP on several exchanges, develop on it, use it, etc while the case is ongoing. Then, if Ripple loses, they'll be fined X amount, and continue on. It's not like if they lose the value goes to zero. It just means they violated a U.S. civil code and have to pay a fine and promise not to do it again.

If you're in the U.S. using coins that at some point in time are determined to be unregistered securities doesn't mean you have done anything wrong and are going to be penalized for it. It means the token issuers did something wrong in the eyes of U.S. law and the issuers need to make it right for U.S. users. History has shown this is done by paying a fine.

I have to disagree with you here. You do not have to participate in the sale. Unless you're a regulator in the U.S., it's not up to you to determine whether what they're doing is legal or not. If you think it's illegal, you can report it to the authorities in your jurisdiction and let them handle it. If they want to offer what you believe might be unregistered securities to U.S. users, that's up to them, and they can suffer any consequences that come from that, if any.

I don't believe Dfinity and ICP will somehow disappear and all the utility will vanish because some projects aren't operating to the letter of any and all U.S. laws. Might it start to look bad for ICP if they all start to rug, die, or start to all get sued. Sure. But I don't believe that will happen.

Hopefully this post will age well. Ha ha!

I'd never assume legal or financial advice to be the outcome of any of my "topics" or just general posts discussing my personal views on the IC and various projects built on it. However, the disclaimer is appreciated and should have been added to my OP among the others as well. I am only trying to facilitate discussion or a "thought exercise" with the IC community. I also appreciate the thoughtfull rebuttle or challenge to my own (current) thought processes. 

Yes, this scenario is fatalistic as you put it. Agreed. I am coming at this from that viewpoint as a means to walk through these fatal scenarios. I appreciate the XRP Ripple example. Yes, they are still having legal "battles", and in the meantime, things appear to continue. However, if the Ripple team, does fail. Yes, they would be slapped with a fine and told not to do it again. It would also imply that the SEC was correct or successful in their bid to label these projects as "unregistered securities". Meaning, if they don't become registered securities they would automatically be in violation. Making the whole "do not do it again" concept mute because it is going to occur regardless due to the nature of these projects. 

If Coinbase and Binance lose the legal battles, it *does* imply or set the precedent that *any* exchange offering these coins or tokens to the public (in the U.S) would also be in violation of the same if they offer them to the public. Meaning Kucoin would have to follow suit and not offer (de-list) them to USA users, or be fined and again end up in a redundant scenario of paying a fee, saying you won't do it again but by nature *have* to do it again to even develop the projects. Thus, it would forcibly diminish a developing industry.  

Not only would it create this fine, and automatic re-violation, it would (to the US court system) see these projects as unregistered securities. Yes, I do not (nor am I) participate in them. However, that is not the legal quarrel at hand. The issue arises when they are offered to the public without registering in the first place. Making it the project's responsibility to *not* offer them to certain subsets or populations. There are *some* who are able to particiapte in unregistered offerings. Again, this is not the issue. The issue would be that if labeled as securites they would be forced to register as securites and follow the rules and regualtions surrounding securities. Which, by nature, violates some crypto projects as a whole, but I personally beleive at the very least include the ICP subjecting the entire global community to play by the same rules. 

I think the problem lies beyond "rup pulls" making the IC look bad and all getting sued. Me making light, of the Tik-Tok videos tradmark label on these "possible unregistered securities" such as "Hot-or-Not" really was to speak of the depth or extent of the "crimes or violations" these projects will be portrayed to have commited or vioated in (any) court battle. Yet, it is willingly being allowed and ignored due to the on-going nature of these court cases. In my opionion, this only cements the view(s) of opposition as being true. 

I also want to push back on how you (and myself more often than not) assume ICP or Dfinity wont disappear. If the NNS continues to operate as it does now, allowing the SNS functionality to be built into the NNS dapp directly, and offering these projects (even to non US places) then it would entangle not just Dfinity in on going legal battles but the Blockchain that they operate on (The IC). It would imply that the IC is the medium in which these unregistered securites are delivered. Forcing a possible cease and desist of any (all) ic related network activites, at the very least until it seperates itself from the SNS projects.

[/quote]

Each project is different, so each case will have to be tried on its own merit, in its own court. There can't be any "automatic" violation. Because of that, each case could end quickly, or take years, depending on the circumstances.

There's also the argument that it is impossible to register at the current time. The SEC is arguing projects can register no problem, they just have to go in and register, yet, not one single large project has been able to. Your argument is based around the ability for projects right now to register as a security, and it is currently not possible to do so. (This is all based on what I've read/heard. I have not tried to register a crypto as a security in the U.S. myself.) Politicians are currently arguing about this. There's also SEC jurisdiction to consider. Some politicians are arguing the SEC doesn't have jurisdiction to do what it is doing. Even some former and current members of the SEC disagree with the general direction. With all of the arguing going on, it's impossible for projects to do what they say they should do.

My whole point is, the legal regulations of crypto in the U.S. are in a state of flux and I'm hoping it will get clear within the next couple years. But right now, it's not clear what projects need to do, so some are going to say screw it and offer it in the U.S. anyway, and some will geo block.

People are going to violate U.S. laws regardless. You will never stop all of it. Take a look at Apple, Microsoft, Samsung, Tesla, Amazon, etc... and what lawsuits they're currently going through. Just because they're violating some law somewhere, even in the U.S. doesn't mean I'm not going to use them. Same goes for these projects.

It might IMPLY that, but again, you have to go case by case. If they aren't hit with a lawsuit, they can operate however they want until that happens. If they are hit with one, they can fight it, or change. Binance.us still offers staking rewards. Kraken removed theirs. Just because Kraken paid the fine and accepted the SEC reasoning on staking, doesn't mean Binance.us automatically has to follow suit. Which they haven't. There are other exchanges and ways to stake your tokens for a return. When Kraken gave in, it didn't seem to diminish the industry in a significant way to me (as far as staking).

That's the nature of litigating in court. One side tries to make the other side look like they're wrong in whatever way possible. Can you prove the videos are stolen or infringing on trademark laws? Did the Hot or Not poster ask permission from the Tik-Tok creator to put their video up? I see the Tik-Tok mark on videos posted to Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, etc. If a Tik-Tok creator is having their videos scraped, its up to them to send out the takedown notices, or file the trademark infringement cases. Then it is the responsibility of the platform to remove it. That's nothing unique to crypto or Hot or Not.

If it's not illegal, then it should be allowed to continue. In my opinion. The U.S. government can bring a case against anyone they feel is violating the law. If the SEC was so sure what a security was when it came to crypto, we wouldn't be having the arguments in congress and the courts right now.

[quote="jsull9, post:10, topic:21250"]

Sure, it's possible. There are several court cases where someone just sues anyone involved in any possible way no matter how small. Consider banks. Do banks get sued when someone wires money to a fraudulent account? I'm sure someone has sued a bank after making that mistake. But it would be very hard to prove the bank was at fault for it. I'm sure people sue credit card companies for letting them make purchases they shouldn't be making. That's going to happen no matter what. It happens in all other industries, crypto will be no different.

First, I want to agree with your overall sentiment. Again, I am not attempting to diminish or jeopardize any project(s).

This is where I suppose as a supporter/enthusiast of the IC I could do *some* poking around myself. However, I may be limited to the resources I have available and might very well find I do not have the ability or access to the required channels to even understand the process as it stands. I will poke down that rabbit hole in the next few weeks and see where it takes me. 

[quote="jwarner, post:11, topic:21250"]

This I want to challenge because, it is a clear violation of trademark infringement, and a while back there was an entire wave of individuals trying to create an "only fans" type product, hence the connection to the softcore porno videos where females are again going to be neglected an\y proper monetary compensation for their "likeness" or content in general. I think the hot-or-not project was, or is a good precursor to set the precedent on the IC. That being it could end up being "more of the same" where content creators are taken advantage of. I see the argument that the individuals who created these original videos have no "reasonable way" of knowing that their likeness is even being stolen or used in a variety of Catfish accounts. Therefore, could not reasonably bring proper charges and receive adequate compensation for the use of their likeness without consent. It still is setting the example, and being endorsed by the IC. 

[quote="jwarner, post:11, topic:21250"]
Consider banks. Do banks get sued when someone wires money to a fraudulent account? I’m sure someone has sued a bank after making that mistake. But it would be very hard to prove the bank was at fault for it. I’m sure people sue credit card companies for letting them make purchases they shouldn’t be making.
[/quote]
This is a fair assessment of another industry and practice that resonates with my overall question or tone. 

[quote="jwarner, post:11, topic:21250"]
It can be IMPLIED, but can it be proven that the IC was somehow at fault? That’s an argument for lawyers/courts, which again, could take years to figure out.
[/quote]
Finally, this is where we (as regular community members) will inevitably end up. You are correct. However, I think it's important to have these conversations amongst ourselves (in a meaningful way) so it can ease the tension inside us average users not looking to do anything except continue our journey without the fear of repercussions from "big brother". 

Again, thank you for your time engaging... 

Best,

No problem, I love a challenge! :rofl: Prove to me which one is a violation.

You can say it's a clear violation all you want, but if you don't have any proof to back it up, in the eyes of the court, it doesn't mean anything. (I'm sure there are tons of violations across multiple platforms, web2 and web3, my point is you need proof to back it up.)

I think the hot-or-not project was, or is a good precursor to set the precedent on the IC. That being it could end up being “more of the same” where content creators are taken advantage of.
[/quote]

The U.S. patent and trademark office (USPTO) has been around for over 200 years and there are still blatant violations across the physical and virtual world. The precedent for this behavior has been set by humanity long ago and the IC, or the platforms that function on it, will not be able to prevent all of it or even MOST of it.

As a creator, it's impossible to know every place your work/likeness is being pirated. If I created a an image that was legally trademarked by me and posted it to this forum (I live in the U.S.), and another user who lives in Japan decides to print the image as a poster and sell it on the streets of Japan without my permission, I would most likely never know. 

Does that mean the forum is at fault for allowing that to happen? Who's responsibility is it to go after that person in Japan? The forum owners who allowed the download? The branch of the Japanese government that handles that type of thing? You can't have a crime or violation without a victim, and if I (the trademark owner) do not file a suit/claim against that person, then there's nothing that can be done. And you are correct, it will be impossible to enforce that 100% or know of all of the places the image is being pirated. BUT, when I post that on the internet for public consumption, I know that if it is stolen/pirated I am the one who is responsible for going after the people who stole it.

In my opinion, the IC is not "endorsing" this because it is not designed to be an enforcer of trademark and patent laws. I can take a picture off the internet and mint it as an NFT on at least 5 different blockchains and sell that on the open market in under an hour. Even if someone creates an app for the specific purpose of skirting those laws and that app happens to be built on the IC, doesn't mean Dfinity/IC is endorsing it.

In my mind, that's like saying ski mask manufacturers endorse robberies because they don't try to actively keep people from covering their face with them when they rob stores/people. Ski masks aren't created for that, but they're definitely used for it.

Yes, you are correct in your assumption. I do not have direct knowledge. This *almost* makes me want to reach out to the original video creators and attempt to prove the violations. However, that would be a bit too vindictive for me. Again, I want these projects to succeed, and that would be a self-defeating purpose just to prove trademark infringement haha! It is tempting though. I did not understand the extent that these rules and regulations have (in the USA). It was not until I started my journey in coding and software development/ engineering that these topics have become so prevalent. My objective is to slowly learn and continue to develop my project. So, these happenstances are excellent opportunities for beginners and students (like myself) to really "dive in" and challenge/ create our ethical standards and best practices. Honestly, in my opinion, the IC community for better or worse has a lot of excellent "case studies", or newly developing projects that help students like myself see the various aspects of development, production, and release to the community.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

So, again, my question is, what exchange are USA users and (or) investors supposed to use, to deposit and sell their already purchased and staked ICP, *if* Coinbase de-lists it. The *only* one that allows people in the USA to access their services *is* (or seems to be I could be mistaken and would love to know) Kraken, which is *only* available in certain states. In NYS for example, these individuals *could* be at a total loss of monetary value *if* no exchange arrives with the credentials to serve the US community...  

Binance has recently reported their deposit addresses will be retiring for the ICP token as well. *Only* selling can occur.

I'm trying to remain optimistic here... however, I really would love any ideas for future planning.


EDIT: I am sifting through all the exchanges listed on Coinmarkecapt.com, and there does not appear to be *any* that are operating in the USA, and *if* they are it is only a very few states. Which, would mean moving, becoming a resident there, selling, reporting it in that state, then moving back, or I now live in this whole other place just to unload my Neuron?

Just to reiterate, I am not a financial/legal expert and am not qualified to give financial/legal advice. Here's my opinion though.

[quote="jsull9, post:15, topic:21250"]

[/quote]

You can use any of them that don't geo-block U.S. users. All this announcement says is they're going to start requiring KYC to use all of their services. In the specific case you mentioned, if you want to sell ICP with a spot trading sell order, you wouldn't have to KYC anyway. Converting it to cash from USDT/USDC to withdraw after you sold it is a different story.

[quote="jsull9, post:15, topic:21250"]

[/quote]

If you sell your ICP for USDT/USDC and hold that in a wallet, as long as whatever stablecoin you choose doesn't de-peg into a death spiral, the monetary value is still there. Again, you might have to find a creative way to get it into your hands as cash, or into your bank though. Or, you can just leave it there until the regulations get sorted out or new exchange options pop up.

[quote="jsull9, post:15, topic:21250"]

I can only use Binance.us so what Binance does with their tokens doesn't change anything for me. Where did you see this announcement? I couldn't find it using a quick Google search.

[quote="jsull9, post:15, topic:21250"]
however, I really would love any ideas for future planning.
[/quote]

This is just my personal opinion and what I use to keep myself mentally healthy. Again, I'm not a financial/legal advisor or expert. I only invest money I can afford to lose. If the whole industry imploded tomorrow and I could not recover any of my funds, I would be fine and could chalk it up to a lesson learned. There are so many other ways to be successful and slowly build a fortune that don't involve crypto in the U.S., and bring less risk. For future planning, don't invest in something unless you have a sold exit strategy you're comfortable with and has a well established infrastructure in the U.S.

There are lots of "if" and "could" statements in your post. As much as things COULD get worse, they also could flip and get better. I'm confident they will get better over time, it's just a matter of waiting it out. If Gensler gets fired/replaced next year, things could get better. If Prometheum (the new exchange who claims to have SEC approval) is legit, that's a potential new way for you to exit. Also, if Prometheum is successful, that just opens the doors for more exchanges to follow in their footsteps and enter the market or update their policies to operate in the U.S. 

But, if you want out now because you're worried, then get out. Do what's best for you.

No, sadly, inside the memo it states that users will no longer be able to deposit or use their services (besides the few/ limited ways listed). Meaning individuals (like myself) with an 8-year stake will have no feasible way to exit. USA users will no longer be able to complete a KYC verification, which means they cannot deposit *any* ICP tokens to their wallet *at all* Again my neuron is an 8-year non-dissolving neuron.

This is the article on Binance's page telling users about retiring deposits. Now, I would ask that after July and when this occurs, if you are able to still deposit in the US. I would (again) have to relocate.

As I know none of this is *actual* advice in highly regulated areas *that is* going to be considered a tax evasion scheme. It *is* going to require knowingly breaking laws, using an illegal swap, and then selling the other asset (which *I could* sell and report profit if any).

As much as I respect this opinion, it does not address nearly 1/4 of what *should* be anyone's concern regardless. Personally, I have enough invested in a neuron (you cannot exit from). While yes, I am completely fine *if* it loses any and all value. Again, this *should/ is not* how these situations can even be justified.

[/quote]

This I already am doing, I stopped investing several months back. Again, I respect the opinion but it is completely beside the point. Whether I lose any monetary value or not. Rules and regulations such as this were nonexistent. Even my tax attorney said what I was doing was legal. Then, because the Token gets removed, from any (possibly) all exchanges (in the same area it was just legal to purchase and buy in months ago). Getting rid of it becomes committing a tax crime. *Even* to get rid of and exit and never look at ICP again I would at this point have to knowingly commit fraud essentially. All because Dfinity/Coinbase didn't play by the rules, and the SEC is more Ludacris than Ludacris the rapper.   

To summarize, I *can* lose any/ all monetary value and I will be fine. Anyone who ever invested in *anything* would have these *same* issues if any of their investment became worthless. Yes, at the end of the day, you will, "have to walk it off" You are right, but there is no one who wouldn't say (having around 1030 ICP mind you) this isn't a reasonable response. 

[quote="jwarner, post:17, topic:21250"]
But, if you want out now because you’re worried, then get out. Do what’s best for you.
[/quote]

Again, my issue *is NOT* wanting to "get out" I've been here for over a year, and my neuron is capped at the max and my maturity is staying in "auto-stake"? Like I'm not just a $50 invested "wooowhooo moon it", type of individual. I'm someone who took this journey rather seriously, and if after going into the second year my rewards get slashed on the regular, then I cannot even use the coin. *Unless* I use it in the ecosystem which would open a floodgate of Ponzi scheme suits. 

My intentions are to still continue the journey and hopefully create my own project. However, there is no talk or really addressing of these rather HUGE issues incoming. I won't sit and sift through Twitter arguments, and at the end of the day, there is just subjective "trust me bro" when I do applaud that mindset it just isn't plausible for what I assume will be *several* individuals once it's de-listed.


I apologize if my tone gives off the impression I want to exit and scream F ICP because I think anyone in my shoes would be anxious, and pretty frustrated. Especially, with the lack of a true plan of action, and inability to exit or permit my neuron ownership with my Ledger attached to the II. As much as I respect Dfinitny and the team I have to say they are looking more and more culpable. 

Really, all I could reasonably do (hypothetically speaking), is contact my tax attorney and ask him to contact the NYS attorney general (or contact them directly) and present my situation allowing them to handle it. Which, would be extremely counterintuitive to my objectives and journey to this blockchain

I'm confused. If you have an 8 year stake, you can't exit for 8 years anyway. The crypto landscape will look vastly different in 8 years. My view is it will get better/easier for us in the U.S. I'm not saying "trust me bro", I'm saying that is my belief, but you should do whatever you believe is right.

My understanding of this memo is not they are retiring some deposit **addresses**. When you want to transfer money into an exchange, that exchange will provide you with an address. Some people will "store" that address so they don't have to verify it every time they want to send a specific crypto to their exchange of choice. This memo is telling users those **addresses** they have used previously MAY be retired, and they will need to use a new one. You can't use Binance in the U.S. at all. They geo-block. So you can't deposit if you live anywhere in the U.S. regardless. This is a non-issue for me as a U.S. user.

It's only tax evasion if you don't pay taxes. I pay my taxes and keep track of my accounting. When I say creative, I don't mean illegal. I mean using different apps, exchanges, wallets that allow U.S. users to legally trade crypto. I have no idea why you think you have to perform illegal swaps at any point in the process.

[quote="jsull9, post:18, topic:21250"]
Again, this *should/ is not* how these situations can even be justified.

I don't know what "situations" you're referring to at present. Right now, you can get into and out of crypto legally in the U.S., including ICP. It's possible every exchange closes in the U.S. and you're stuck. It's also possible the market expands and you'll have multiple exchanges to use in the future. Glass half full/empty scenario in my mind. I'm looking at half full. Not asking you to "trust me bro", I'm saying that's what I think. I could be wrong.

[quote="jsull9, post:18, topic:21250"]

We'll just have to agree to disagree here. The laws can be interpreted by you one way, and me another. I don't believe this is true.

Let me give an example of how I think about this scenario outside of crypto. I go and buy a tool off eBay/offerup/facebook marketplace. The seller sends it to me, I use it, I'm happy. A month later, I sell it at a garage sale. A day after I sell it, the police show up at my door saying they saw I purchased a stolen tool off eBay/offerup/facebook and they want it back to return to the original owner. But, I already sold it. In the eyes of the law, did I commit a crime? In your view, I did, in my view, I did not. I did nothing wrong in this scenario. It all comes down to your intent and specific circumstances around your situation.

[quote="jsull9, post:18, topic:21250"]
*Unless* I use it in the ecosystem which would open a floodgate of Ponzi scheme suits.
[/quote]

Based on this, your outlook of the ecosystem and mine are vastly different. Ha ha! Nothing wrong with that, I'm just saying this is another place where I would respectfully disagree. I see a lot of people building on ICP that are not planning schemes.

[quote="jsull9, post:18, topic:21250"]
However, there is no talk or really addressing of these rather HUGE issues incoming.

Maybe because some people don't view them as HUGE? I don't. I have other strategies that are all legal where I live and am confident it will work out. I could be wrong for course. Still not worried.

Since you're in for the long haul, write up a plan of action that you feel would satisfy your concerns and submit it to the NNS or the Feedback board and see where it goes. Get involved with governance and try to drive ICP in a direction you think is better. If you don't like the CEX options, write to your legislator and let them know. In my mind, there are plenty of ways to make changes if you put in the sweat equity.

I second this ✅ Any crypto investor would be wise to pay taxes considering the targeted 🎯 approach by regulators on the market. At the end of the day regulators would want to keep the market alive and open inorder to drive up their tax incomes 💯 and boost innovation 💫

At the current time, the laws in place can not even dictate who to oversee the crypto market. However as time passes, just like the mist of the morning due, the chaos would clear up and pave way to a more transparent process of governance in the digital world. 🙏

Yeah, instead of going back and forth I'll chalk it up so we will have to agree to disagree. Perhaps your area of the US allows for such leniency but I do not. Participating in *any* DEX swap unregistered with the SEC is a crime and could be seen as a tax evasion-like scheme (as previously mentioned).  

[quote="jwarner, post:19, topic:21250"]
We’ll just have to agree to disagree here. The laws can be interpreted by you one way, and me another. I don’t believe this is true.
[/quote]

I will say the law is the law. So, just because we interpret it differently does not mean that sitting in front of a judge they will "buy", I did not interpret the law this way. Again, not a very good set of practices for any project. 

Why am I concerned when I am in it for the long haul? Because, if in 8 years I *still* can't purchase or sell ICP then I'm stuck with *only* what I own currently plus maturity meaning i'd run out of cycles and my project would be complete waste of time. 

[quote="jwarner, post:19, topic:21250"]
In my mind, there are plenty of ways to make changes if you put in the sweat equity.

Again, this is not a plausible response as a one-person community member when I cannot even reasonably get a response from Dfinity or the team on the forum (98% of the time). Or even acknowledgment of my concerns here. This is the same as telling a child, "Well if you want to sell lemonade you gotta get out there and try" when the closest neighbor is 100 miles away, dead broke, and has their own dang lemonade a-he.

You can’t use Binance in the U.S. at all. They geo-block. So you can’t deposit if you live anywhere in the U.S. regardless. This is a non-issue for me as a U.S. user.

This confuses me though. How do you use Binance if they geo-block? Perhaps it was a miss communication/ typo. 

[quote="jwarner, post:19, topic:21250"]
It’s only tax evasion if you don’t pay taxes.
[/quote]

again, this is *not* true in NYS, participating in swaps and unregistered securities is seen as either a tax evasion scheme or at the very least participating in unregistered securities or purchasing from an exchange not registered can land you with fines, *on top of taxes*. To put it simply (in NYS) using these "swaps" is illegal. I mean, of course, I could hypothetically get away with it. This isn't the point, as the investor and or developer these should be the last of my concerns.

I do believe we have vastly different views on the IC and the direction things are heading this is fine. I am going to tag Dfinity members directly to see if they *finally* respond...

@bjoernek @diegop anyone or any help with what Dfinity plans on doing in this event would be lovely.

Binance and Binance.us are two separate entities. Binance.us operates inside the U.S., Binance does not. I cannot use Binance because they geo block U.S. users.

Ok, I haven't read/heard about any cases or laws from NYS that say this. Maybe they just aren't that publicized? I also don't live there so don't keep up on specific state laws for NYS. I would be interested in reading them if you have them easily accessible? Or any articles that talk about them? If not, no worries.

Just to throw this out there, there was a memorandum and order filed in the SEC vs. LBRY case today in the district of New Hampshire. The full document is [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9opwley51peioqzwgvlm8/US_DIS_NHD_1_21cv260_d19671166e199_MEMORANDUM_AND_ORDER_RE_89_Motion_to_Limit_the_Com.pdf?dl=0&rlkey=8ju1p2o7r3tb1dundhvclwv8x). Some interesting excerpts:

"**the SEC asks the court to order LBRY to pay a civil penalty of $111,614 and issue an injunction restraining LBRY from violating § 5 of the Securities Act and from participating in unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities in the future.**"

"**I agree with LBRY that the SEC has not presented sufficient evidence to-date that Odysee, LBRY’s subsidiary, should be enjoined**"

"**As for third-party holders of LBC, the SEC has not argued in this case that they could violate the injunction merely by purchasing or selling LBC.**"

"**Given the SEC’s litigation posture, it suffices to say that merely holding LBC or purchasing it for consumptive purposes is insufficient to bring third parties within the purview of Rule 65(d).**"

To have a bigger and broader vision on where the future is headed,  I like to oversimplify stuff/concepts by knowing what the real intentions of issues is/are. 

First I want to know the viewpoint from NYC regulators in US since they seem to be the most active in applying regulations. What is their goal here? 

1. On a mega scale, is the goal to make it illegal to buy/sell ICP and as such prevent US engineers from IC innovation? 

2. Is the goal to remove ICP from markets and prevent investors from buying or participating in any future IC projects? 

3. Is the goal doubling down on the evasion of taxes by preventing all crypto projects transactions in the US?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-21 16:52:35 UTC | #25

any DEX that is unwilling to register as a national exchange and receive the bit license should *geo-block" USA users. 


This especially pertains to where the SEC is heading https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-153 this is an excellent example. 

Right now, Coinbase is going to have an absolute monopoly over the ICP token in NYS past July 15 when Kucoin bans deposits in non-kyc verifiable areas. You are not able to legally purchase or use these or *any* of the DEX's on the IC until or unless they register. None of them (from my knowledge) have and yet they continue to sell and provide these services, *while also* planning on creating their own DAO/ token, another red flag for *any* USA user. 

As for the Binance, you are right Bianance.us *still* is not allowed in NYS. Binance as an entire company cannot be used in several states, Coinbase is the only *legal* exchange and they may have to remove it as well. Hence the growing concern and epic proportion of anxiety over *no plan of action* if there is no exchange to exit, move, or use.


Look at this excerpt from the SEC app developer case, "Without admitting or denying the findings in the order, Abra and Plutus Tech agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a combined penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced a settlement with Abra and Plutus Technologies arising from similar conduct."

Respectfully sir, there is no need for any of that to happen. 

The courts would have to decide what is a security, and what is a commodity! And thereafter, companies can consider to register as needed. As far I am concerned it is in the best interest of the US to spearhead innovation on the IC hence they must thread carefully. The contrary would be a lack of innovation and massive loss in talent and productivity in what many might call the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Are you not reading the federal laws I blatantly pointed out regarding unregistered exchanges holding "swaps"? Are *any* of the DEX's on the IC registered with the CFTC, SEC,or *any* of the FEDERAL requirements? If not then they should be geo-blocking USA users, or expect at the very least the lawyers fees, plus if unwilling to fight in court another 150,000 just to get rid of the fines and agree to never do it again. 

This again, brings me to the point of where should or can US users legally sell, deposit, exit or continue to accumulate for cycles consumption? If Coinbase is forced to stop selling the token in certain areas, or all together and Binanance.us does the same.

No I have not read any of them and I don’t plan to. The articles over complicate simple concepts and I was asking simple questions but since you didn’t want to answer, I’ll go with my narrative. 

Have you ever stopped to wonder what the people want? Forget about what NYC regulators are doing, have you talked to regular investors and have their viewpoints. 

The first time colonizers came to Africa, they handed out Bibles to Africans and doubled down on the verses that told of stories of obeying masters, and forgiving enemies. Meanwhile they were looting Africa, killing, raping innocent civilians…committing crimes of humanity. And what were Africans supposed to do, read the Bible and forgive. 

I bring that up to shade light on the power of information. Wrong information is dangerous and as far as I am concerned I am not wasting my time reading articles that have views that I know are wrong regardless of their validity. I know what’s right and what’s wrong and I have done my research and I am also well aware of where the future is headed. As far as I’m concerned the only crime is not paying taxes and that’s goes back over 2000+ years. However I don’t often see regulators doubling down on the Billionaires club to pay their fair share on one of the oldest crimes in the markets, which is unfair payment of taxes. 

NYC can make their laws but they are not national/federal. Nor would they be used as a template in the Wild West. What’s funny about laws is, LAWS FOLLOW WHERE THE MONEY IS, and not the other way around; the market always regulates itself = equilibrium. So the question here is; are investors blind on the potential assets, productivity and innovation that might arise if they open up the markets to the 4th Industrial Revolution?

I have to stop and end this engagement here. These "articles" are federal laws, rules, and regulations with case examples... With all due respect, I have no appropriate response to this. You can have your narrative. It's not *exactly* the reality of the global situation though. You can't just ignore these rules simply because you don't like them flat out plain and simple. No amount of comparison to x, y or z will be able to fight the law. The law is the law. 

Hopefully, someone from dfinity or *anyone* who cares about the IC will start to understand the depth of what I'm saying and not just ignore the facts. We need solutions. If not, then maybe more people need to grab whistles and start blowing. How else is *anyone* to be heard?

If they were getting sued, you'd better believe they'd be more into enforcement. That's the problem with copyright law, its normally up to the copyright holder to get something done.

Oh you are way behind in where this conversation led lol Copyright and Trademark issues are *still* a huge concern I have for these applications, however, what might be more concerning is the production and distribution of "unregistered securities" on "unregistered exchanges". 

I believe enforcement on these issues will come in the coming months, weeks, or days. I'm surprised IClighthouse, Sonic, ICswap, or any of the DEXs on the IC haven't been slammed with lawsuits and (or) criminal charges for offering these products to anyone inside the US. As excited as the tech makes me and as much as I want to see projects succeed. I do not hope *any* of their SNS launches are successful if offered to any USA user because there are too many legal repercussions. It will be nothing but rug pulls *just* to pay the legal fees and agree to never do it again.

I think it's a great project, and I hope it succeeds. But I also realize it doesn't revolve around the U.S., or any state in the U.S. 

You're saying "we need solutions", but who is the we? You're not speaking for me. I'm guessing you're not speaking for anyone outside of the U.S. If YOU want solutions to make sure NYS users in the U.S. are assured access to ICP, offer up some solutions, announce them to the community through proposals, etc. Create a named Neuron and put out your goals, or what you want to change. See if you get other Neurons to follow you. Get on OpenChat, Dscvr, etc. and talk about what solutions YOU are offering. Yelling, "We need to do something" to me translates to "You need to do something." You'll get a lot more traction if you offer up some of your own solutions to the problems you feel need to be solved.

To me, the "I'm only one person" argument doesn't hold water, especially in this environment. This is the perfect ecosystem to invest your personal time in and use the tools available to gauge what other IC holders/stakers think of your ideas. If you don't get the votes on you proposals, or the feedback is contrary to your thoughts, maybe it's time to reconsider your strategy. Or accept that people just don't agree with you at this point in time.

I believe I understand what you're trying to get across, but respectfully, I don't share your vision/concerns of what the future is going to bring.

Well, all this news is certainly disappointing and disheartening, but I don't think web3 innovation can be stopped.

For one thing, we should soon be able to trade ICP for other assets like BTC and ETH, so if all ICP exits really were blocked we could just swap to another asset within web3 and then exit with a different asset.

As a last resort, we also have things like ntagle around the corner. That will allow for untraceable physical crypto transactions that will be as impossible to stop as the black market.

Where there's a web3 dev, there's a way!

At the end of the day though, I think the USA has mostly been posturing, and won't end up being as anti-crypto as they are making things appear right now. We aren't in the habit of inhibiting innovation in the USA, but we are in the habit of shifting narratives to fit our interests.

This is one of my (many) concerns though. Participating in an unregistered swap to exit a token that is no longer offered in certain jurisdictions *could* be seen as either a tax evasion-like scheme, or be fined for each time you "participate". Swapping to BTC or ETH in certain areas *would/ could* still require violating these rules. Again I am not a fan. However, if someone wishes to be completely transparent, and operate legally in their areas then these unregistered swaps would not be plausible.

This is *almost* the exact scenario that unnerves me. Investors and developers should not have to consider the ethical dilemma of selling their ICP on the black markets. This is the rationale behind my whole initiative and reasoning for urging dialogue and opening up the difficult questions. This is why I urge DEXs to limit their services to non-USA users *only*. 


To avoid going back into a conversation where I am attacked I won't dive into that here. I have said my piece on the other DEXs on the IC post. I raised concerns that the blockchain was breaking securities and exchange laws and was met with significant retaliation. 


Finally, I just want to take a moment to thank you for being respectful and engaging in constructive feedback. It truly means a great deal.

Goodmorning @jsull9 , I wanted to start by saying I respect what you’re doing, how gracefully you’ve conveyed your opinions, and the calm tone you’ve taken to address all rebuttals. 

However, I regret to inform you that the people of this blockchain do not care for regulatory compliance - “Web3 has no borders”.

I’ve raised similar regulatory concerns within the following proposal, and received the same, negative backlash, reflecting the discontent with complying with regulation, as you have.

If you have an actionable solution, I strongly recommend you put it to proposal, as that ironically, is the closest you can get to an “honest understanding of community sentiment” - the forums are beyond an echo chamber & you will find little support here (as much as you deserve it). At the very least it documents the effort to amend the flaw, in the instance regulators do start to crack down.

Great news for Americans, according to the XRP verdict, ICP wont be considered a security for any purchases made on centralized or decentralized exchanges. 

However, venture capitalists and institutions involved in the presale ( or OTC) might face challenges, provided they are located in the United States. For those based outside the U.S., this issue does not pose a concern.

I'm thinking that same thing, which means both of the overlapping class action cases out of California will have an uphill battle since they're focusing on purchases on/after May 10th 2021 which the filings show was the first day ICP was available on exchanges.

However it’s really unfortunate how this conversation has gone from something productive, to taking it off topic by attempting to attack the characters of people involved.

Some people do have fair points in regards to the SEC Case, but they’d be a lot more effective in conveying their points if they offered their conclusion in regards to the information, rather than attacking people for not presenting the information for them.

It's amazing to me that a topic so boring (no offence) could generate such passion. I spent most of my life thinking that legal conversations were always conducted in hushed tones, but this is balls-to-the-wall outrage around every corner. Fantastic!

From my own non-US chair, I've been looking closely at MiCA and designing a crypto-commodity that clearly marks itself as *not* a security. Just like creative accounting, I think the solution is in creative asset design and developing new protocols that can leverage the amazing powers at our fingertips.

It’s hilarious how transparently & broadly you apply your smear tactics on a censored forum - you’re setting a great example of the community DFINITY cultivates for when the rest of the crowd shows up & does some research.

You quite clearly did no research into the ignorant statements your making - a quick reference of @jsull9 forum account debunks every attempted slanderous statement you’ve made. 

I’m not going to entertain your comments any more, as quite frankly, just about everyone falls under off topic, ad hominem, or any of the other countless logical fallacies claimed as “rules” within this forum - that is the job of the moderators & they quite clearly have no interest in moderating what you say, as the sole source of liquidity within this ecosystem.

It is good news. I've found it pretty hard to look at the IC, and think that anyone would find the primary use case for the ICP token to be as an investment.

Regardless it is an important win:

Here are some general possibilities for what Ripple's wins could mean for other cryptocurrencies like ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) and others:

1. **Programmatic Sales**: These are typically automated sales of tokens that occur according to a predefined schedule or set of conditions. The court ruling in favor of Ripple on this point could suggest that programmatic sales of a cryptocurrency may not necessarily be seen as unregistered securities offerings. However, the specifics of each case would be crucial.
2. **Other Distributions**: This might refer to methods of distributing tokens other than through sales, such as airdrops, staking rewards, or other types of distributions. The court's ruling could imply that these types of distributions might not be considered unregistered securities offerings.
3. **Sales by Founders/Executives**: The court also ruled in favor of Ripple regarding the sales of XRP by Larsen and Garlinghouse. This could suggest that sales of a cryptocurrency by its founders or executives may not automatically be seen as unregistered securities offerings.

The IC is a globally accessible project.  If the US wants to cut itself off from the rest of the world and lose out on the most amazing technical advances imaginable, so be it.  There is no reason projects should be hamstrung for the benefit of a vocal minority.

The USD is the world reserve currency & North America was responsible for ~25% of global cryptocurrency volume in 2021-2022. Furthermore, ~90% of ICP’s Nodes are in North America.

That is no minority.

Complying with regulation is not being “hamstrung” - this is something every single crypto project is going to have to deal with as major players enter the industry.

Just because it is “web3” does not mean there are no borders, jurisdictions, etc

Really?! The dashboard gives the impression of a more spread-out distribution. This seems like a sub-optimal situation, given the volatility of American policy, rhetoric etc.

How did you get to this figure? As a follow-up, isn't it the geo-location of boundary nodes that is more important, when it comes to content oversight? I'd love to have my finger on the pulse for these metrics.

First, let me start by thanking you for "stepping in" (along with any/all others), and helping this conversation remain constructive. Your kindness, support, and passion along with others such as @aiv, @willguest, @Jupes_M, and @jwarner mean' *a lot*. I am surprised I did not see this proposal and I apologize for not getting more involved in it when it was present. I actually think this raised several valuable points that I want to continue helping you in any way possible. The initiative in that proposal speaks volumes of the value you bring to the community. Please continue raising and helping assist dialogue with these difficult questions/ conversations.  

Also, I want to take a moment and think @aiv for his [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-defining-an-ethos-for-the-nns/16090) here. Now, more than ever, I feel this proposal should be re-evaluated, added enforceable code to appease the foundation's desire for code instilled.

Apologies, I also just referenced the dashboard & it seems like the initial figure I’ve referenced is a bit inaccurate (source found below).

https://twitter.com/lysergin333/status/1676259487689355265?s=46&t=p9K9YrK2DF2OD_cPX2QYTA

It’s more like ~200 in Europe, ~100 Asia, 6 in Africa, and ~400 North America.

So in reality only ~60% - sorry for the inaccuracy.

In regards to boundary nodes, there’s seemingly ~7 in North America, ~8 in Europe, and ~2 in Asia. So they’re definitely more distributed, but the majority of the computing power comes from USA.

jsull9 | 2023-07-14 13:31:02 UTC | #75

Thank you (again) for providing this. I too, *still* have the same concerns and position. However, I am not, nor has this entire initiative been to diminish ICP. 

Also, I do think the Ripple ruling is *extremely* good news and does set a good sentiment for things to come. However, to play devil's advocate here, there are *key* distinctions between Coinbase's lawsuit and Ripples. The programmatic sales seem to be where *we all* hope Coinbase is safe. However, in Coinbase's T/C it explicitly states that anyone using their exchange is *essentially* holding a wallet inside their own larger wallet. Meaning Coinbase *might* not have the same deniability. Perhaps, the coinbase.pro or the now advanced markets could create that (hopefully). 


I also want to point out that even if Coinbase is successful with the Programmatic argument, I still think the community should be paying close attention to the ICP portion of the SEC filing. More specifically [pages 65- (top of) 68.](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-102.pdf)

This to me, says even *if* the SEC has to pivot the *still* are setting a dangerous precedent of using language that implies it could directly file against those mentioned in the report. In fact, In my opinion, Ripple managed plausible deniability through unproblematic PR, and *that* is what helped them win. However, according to pages 65-68 in the complaint, the SEC seems to have different material to establish the case against ICP. This again, raises concerns, that they do not plan on stopping at Coinbase. It appears they will be furthering their agenda to *any/all* listed in the complaint. 


I will say, the Programmatic claim *did/does* really help establish DeFi, and how DEXs *could* operate successfully. To avoid hurting feelings, I will just say my position remains the same *for now*. Especially, with how intertwined the SNS AND community fund is as @Accumulating.icp pointed out in their thread. I also feel I did my part to raise ethical concerns, biases, and unfulfilled obligations inside this community. I was reading the [DAO](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf) investigation report, and felt how the governance and voting system established there, is much like the NNS for the ICP. Pages 13-17 really depict a similar reality for ICP token holders. 


To summarize, I am glad we got the good news from the ripple example a great way to start gaining case law that is nonexistent. However, we are still not "out of the woods" *yet*. If this were the exact ruling on the Coinbase complaint I would have no problem humbly taking the L. You win some you lose some. You will strike out more often than you hit home runs, but you keep swinging. I will never stop, nor apologize for raising ethical concerns and possible securities violations. This is my civic duty, and my responsibility to adhere to R/R in my area. Especially, with the desire to operate my own NPO. I will not be bullied into silence. Having *no* plan, and letting it play out makes you just as complicit. 

Again, thanks to everyone who actively participated in healthy discussion and made this a place where we can have civil discourse because you know, we *are* on a forum built on discourse. 


One final note: If you want community members to put in *any* real work and man-hours on the IC governance, or in general I would advise you to stop sending individuals to Major social media platforms to be met with "your BAD PR go to the forum" to then be met with major contributors of the ecosystem try to silence your voice through extremely childish tactics while the moderators of this form do nothing. It really has spoken volumes to how staff *really* see the average users, developers, and investors (in my opinion of course).

the most amazing technical advances imaginable
[/quote]

The problem with quoting things (he said, quoting things) is that it can steer the conversation into side alleys. I feel the main sentiment was about the technological affordances, but it got somewhat left behind.

I second this point, plus this seems (to me) to be Dfinity's general attitude as well: let the technology speak for itself. So much of the discussion around regulation does not get at the heart of the matter, which is the use of ICP within the system.

Most coins are variables in an algorithm that maintains a stable state while providing value in the form of consensus-backed transactions or other services to the owner. Thinking about ETH, it is a fundamentally virtual enterprise, meaning the barrier to entry is 'a device' and a few $. The staking model exists entirely as an abstraction for "belief in the network".

The Internet Computer, I would argue, is another animal altogether. Sure, the result is still consensus-driven decision-making, but there is a dedicated hardware layer and, baked into the tokenomics, there is the deflationary burning of cycles to pay for computation on the node machines. There is a physical process happening, which is automatically crowd-funded by the network's users. 

I am no lawyer, but I can imagine this idea having legal weight.

This is a good point to continue in *any* of my posts. However, in the case of this post. I think using *some* quotes is okay.

Yes, this may drastically change from the current NA / Europe predominance. However that does not change the current state of the network.

Furthermore, nobodies saying the USA is the centre of the universe 🤦🏻‍♂️ I am saying that they’re the world reserve currency though, and responsible for 25% of volume in the last bull market, so if you want to continue to tap into that liquidity, certain changes will have to be made to avoid breaking laws, copyright infringements, etc.

An abundance of this thread has been in regards to copyright infringements - not only taxable jurisdictions. 

It’s unrealistic to expect a country to drop laws that are essentially in place for the protection of individual property.

Furthermore, just about every country abides copyright laws. 

We can say that the US should be the one to change their tax code for ICP all we want - but there’s functionalities in ICP that we’re made with the intention of “evading tax”. I wish you luck convincing them that this is part of the “new world” and that they should “let it go”.

Q: So who is the average user of the Internet Computer? 
A: That has yet to be determined. 

For instance, I think it is ridiculous for someone to even suggest that the average user is even going to be human. We are in the 4th Industrial Revolution. Robots, programs, vending machines and all sorts of machines are going to own their own money. They are going to be needing to buy things, and are even going to be owning their own businesses.

You know what's really great about the Internet Computer? It's a Decentralized cloud. Meaning that if you own any data which could be used for AI training models, you can put that information on lockdown. AI technology has just arrived, and it is already more than obvious that ethical collection of data for training AI models is going to be the market. And things like, retail sales figures, aren't  something in which you want to train your models on with data from the 2010s. IC canister holds the encrypted data, and the fetch.ai aea (autonomous economic agent) sells the data. 
https://docs.fetch.ai/colearn/

That's not any sort of hype, those are some of the future use cases which exist in the IOT ICP world. Technological Innovation takes some time to understand. And the Internet Computer is very innovative;  hence- larger learning curve. But, the benefit being that everyone who passes it is just as committed as you are. 

I hope you find this information useful. There is so much happening right now, and it is only getting faster. It won't be too long before the Internet Computer gets its Space Invaders.

I am honestly glad you brought up the AI segway. I think Chat GPT is an excellent segway into ethical concerns. Recently, the CEO of their company had several conversations about the need for proper regulation and very strict ethics in place for upcoming AI. So, I am glad you mentioned this. It actually helps further my (along with others) points. These are ethical obligations needing to be upheld or at the very least discussed inside the community. Not on social media forms. The company of Chat GPT recently agreed and is willing to work with and stay in compliance. All I would expect is the IC does the same. At the very least in the areas that require it. 

Personally, I struggle with a variety of issues this form has in the T/C itself. However, this forum is the best way to engage in thoughtful dialogue. I urge everyone (again) to keep it respectful.

@diegop @Ang moderators really need to moderate. You've allowed this individual to disrupt and continue harassing us for how long?

-------------------------

@diegop @Ang @kpeacock it would be swell if we could get a moderator over here. For the millionth time.

@diegop @kpeacock @Ang nothing? Just going to let this individual continue spamming the thread and making direct attacks?

Actually I know the answer to that, sorry.  Let's just stick with "what companies have you helped / investred in [sic]"

@diegop this seems to be getting out of hand. Just figured I’d tag you for awareness

Ah ok, you're going with "large donor".  Not as bad as I thought.

I made a career out of being myself and made the biggest game on the internet from 1999-2015 and I haven't changed or diverted from that path.

Don't need counselling, have a great life and an even greater game.  I'm doing this to make the IC great because it deserves it.

Why you're here focusing on me though, that's a bit weird.  On holiday with my kids, coding the biggest web3 MMO in Rust, and just wondering why some guy is constantly trying to undermine the platform Im building on.

Because it makes no sense (unless you were trying to destroy it)

Goodnight, Walter

I have tagged and notified several moderators they plain and simply do not care. They are going to keep letting this go on as a means to silence my own opinion about them, and other community members.

Why stay here?  Who's paying you to hang around on the forums, pretend to be intelligent and constant;y attack people?

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-07-14 20:49:36 UTC | #131

maybe they have better things to do than deal with some squealing psyop fail

I hope everyone here reading this, plus @kvic @Accumulating.icp @aiv are taking notice of this individual is just allowed.
