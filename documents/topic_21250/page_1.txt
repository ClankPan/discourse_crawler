@diegop this seems to be getting out of hand. Just figured I’d tag you for awareness

So much for my family summer vacation :wink: 

I have gotten enough pings about this, that I am compelled to come back online (I was doing really well avoiding inter-webs for a brief spell there). Apologies for anyone who has pinged me recently without a response. Please allow me some time to catch up.

the end is nigh.. quickly, say something snappy and final...

Support your local governors, grow more vegetables, try to remember you're all on the same team

are you on holiday with Borovan as well ???

jsull9 | 2023-07-14 20:52:25 UTC | #140

exactly. It is not just him I have had several days now and spoken with several moderators. I feel bad others cannot do it and if he is on vacation has to deal with @borovan. This is insane.

Fwiw I did not know you were on vacation and do apologize for the bother. I’m not super familiar with other mods

No need to apologize, no reason you should know. It is more a sign that I should have prepared for my time away a bit more. That is on me.

**Moderator note:**

This thread has gotten out of hand. Not only are there hundreds of messages, there are many people reporting each other for moderation well beyond the norm. I can barely keep up, to be quite frank.

**Short Term:**

1. I am going to lock this thread. Those who feel attacked, will no longer be attacked. Those who feel there are trolls, will see no more trolls.

2. I am going to carefully and slowly read this entire thread with the benefit of time.

**Medium term**

There is a common pattern brewing I will propose in a future meta thread (yet to be written), but here is a small indication:

* Forum threads where people ask technical or coding questions and people help them ---> good vibes
* Forum threads where people opine on legal or tax matters (even when it is about other people's countries, not everyone lives in the same country) ---> terrible vibes 

**I am heavily considering that we limit the second type of forum post as it often goes off the rails**. The first type of topic flowers, and should be encouraged. There are many other forums where people can discuss ICP-related topics not covered in this forum, and I am worried the toxicity for the latter type of topics invites trolls, legitimately concerned people, ad hominem attacks, etc... I am not convinced **this forum** needs these types of forum threads at the cost of the overall community decorum.

Rather than simply addressing those who drove this conversation off-topic, you’ll resort to shutting down the entire dialogue, **again**..? This seems to be a recurring theme - I remember a time when you all begged us to come to forums because “Twitter is bad PR”, which was entertained in good faith. 

Now you seemingly want to silence people here too. 

It’s almost like the desire was a controlled environment for dialogue, rather than finding resolution out of the public light to avoid negative connotation.

You’ve concluded your moderation by finding problems in those sparking dialogue (essentially justifying childish behaviour from the community), rather than allowing free discussion & moderating in accordance to your set of rules. 

It’s really telling of the environment that is being cultivated, and beyond transparent. 

The objective here is quite clearly to shut down this dialogue, while discrediting it & those involved where possible. 

DFINITYs handling of these scenarios has been directly responsible for the departure of countless developers & community members, and if you continue on this track, you will be responsible for the departure of countless more. 

You all say we need more independent contributors; until they begin to critically think - at which point this narrative of “paid bad actors” & ad hominem is directed at anybody attempting to participate. 

In hindsight, the picture you’ve painted has been very telling, and will serve as the warning sign to anybody doing research into this ecosystem. 

I imagine in response to this there’s going to be quite a few “baiting” comments, which I quite frankly am not going to entertain, as they only go to prove my point. 

I wish you all luck on your legal battle against every jurisdiction & government in the world - considering we don’t care to comply with any major jurisdiction.

I would like to put forward my perspective, mostly in an effort to give more balance to the end of this thread. I will begin by saying that I think your efforts to moderate this forum have been superlative. @diegop, you have been a model of restraint and have always taken time to reflect on how you could do things better, rather than find fault with others. Thank you.

I agree that this patterns exists, and would note that it is prevalent in wider society, of which this forum is undeniably a microcosm. However, coincidence does not necessarily mean causality. Political alignments are, apparently, a personal affliction that need to be defended as though personal honor is at stake. This, in my view, is simply mirrored, learned behaviour. It is what we are fed on a daily basis (if we allow ourselves to be) by all of those in positions of authority. Shame on them, and the weak-minded, click-baiting journalists who have lost sight of their profession. Anyone who says "people respond to fear and greed, so that's what I give them" should be immediately fired.

Despite my disgust of this extreme and deliberate polarisation, this is the reality of our world now.  I am a believer that the answer is more, and not less, speech. I think that excluding topics from the forum would be a mistake, but I agree that some more rigourous action needs to be taken, in order to mitigate these destructive tendencies that are so pervasive.

I have no doubt that the odd person here might have the intent to destroy the whole thing, but let's not leap to this straight away,eh? We are all focused on web3, most of us focused on ICP and quite a few even working alongside each other. Aren't we a team? Why so much hate? 

To those sowing FUD, treat them kindly, but don't think of their words as anything more than a fart in the room. Just open a window or light a candle. Don't fight fire with fire, because we all burn.

Honestly with new tech like IC you can't be a precious whatever. Everything you thought was unchangeable is now up for debate.  You can finally get a truly independent party (the Ic) to manage your estate for generations to come. That is just one of the myriad of uses.  The potential change is mind-blowing. Stop clinging to the prescribed narrative and start to make your own future. A fair future governed by an unbribable source.

Another use case.. i backed an early charity project that had good intentions. It didn't materialise into anything as the block chain at that point couldn't handle the complexity required (pre ic).  Imagine a fully traceable line from your donation to % of employee wages, %of animal feed etc.  Its a way to end the corruption that plagues many charitable causes and see real change for your donations.   The IC could also help with narrowing down what you wish to put your money towards   if it is hedgehogs in the UK, endangered fish in the south Pacific etc. Your money could be traced directly to a final destination.

@diegop, Seems that your little plan didn’t work out.

Your censorship skills are in my opinion biased and your plan to let my discussion playout has backfired on you.

As you can see this discussion has become centralized and failed.

This is what happens when you censor those who give good questions and answers to arrive at a decentralized understanding and allow the unhelpful to continue to bully and create a centralized discussion with hand purports taking over.

I am a developer in a "Developer forum" and this thread didn't provide me with any valuable intel.
I would love advices from lawyers in the forum, but this doesn't look like it. It's full of uncertainty.
I appreciate the questions raised, but this forum doesn't fit. The questions are mixed with fear, bias and everyone has to go thru the first dozen messages talking about banning, delisting, infrigement, basically all the legal questions and fears surrounding crypto, involving Hot or Not, while they aren't the only app that lacks strict moderation. (Modclub can fix?). This sets unproductive tone. There seem to be 50 different topics in here and each needs its own experts, evidence and conclusions. This will better fit a wiki? dscvr? quora? Experts voting on solutions staking their authority. The result should be something easier to digest and more conclusive. Something a developer/entrepreneur can use to improve whatever they are doing. 
Whoever is interested in dabbling with this, should perhaps create a web3 app, invite experts, raise the questions, reward them. I'll pay to read that.

This isn’t just a developer forum. They have governance and general topic.

Maybe they SHOULD make it a developer only forum and remove all governance out of here to increase decentralization.

Disciplines of study are more effective when they are multidisciplinary. Overlapping of topics removes any blind spots that may be present in development of a project. All conversations are welcome here on the forum. Nothing should be left unsaid, however, participants need to display respect when articulating their ideas in order to maximize the quality of conversations.
