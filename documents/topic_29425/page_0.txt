 Support 

Hello, I am quite new to the ICP ecosystem and I was able to host a frontend canister with Angular 
using this repository:

/hello-angular-motoko github repository

I replaced the components and created a HttpClient to a heroku backend that is public. 
However when trying to make requests from the frontend after deploy, It seems to be all fine on my network and even my mobile data, however other people opening the canister from the link can make any requests to heroku. When they make request without the frontend the requests pass, however something in the canister is not letting them pass.

Are you saying that when the user is making the request using the canister backend independent of the canister frontend then they are unable access the request? If so, what is the error that they are getting?
