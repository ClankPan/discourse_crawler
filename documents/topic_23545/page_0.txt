# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/d628aa32d72565c9e5258d033b3c0be194c77b24/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c d628aa32d72565c9e5258d033b3c0be194c77b24
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

And there is another “feature build” that enables [QUIC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) protocol for state sync. We would like to deploy it to a subset of subnets again. Here is the [proposal 125002](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125002)

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, and @ilbert.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @Gekctek and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here if you have any questions or suggestions.

Hey @nikola-milosa several of the CodeGov reviewers including @ilbert, @zane, and @cyberowl picked up on a few minor typos in the changes this week.  You might want to ask some of the change owners to take a look at their comments so they can determine relevance.  

Also, @Zane recognized that DFINITY corrected one of the issues this week that was identified by @cyberowl last week.  That was really cool.  Thanks!
