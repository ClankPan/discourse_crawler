**`A Call to Action: Using the NNS for Growth`**

Co-sponsors: @dfisher & @wpb 

`Problem Statement:`

Today, ICP suffers from two separate problems that we believe could be improved with a single silver bullet. Those two problems are as follows:

1. The incentive to upgrade ICP by meaningfully participating in governance is low
2. The demand from dApp developers and end users to use ICP is well below what the Internet Computer is capable of

Let’s tackle each problem separately.

Governance on the IC today follows the liquid democracy model. Stakers are encouraged to either vote directly on proposals or follow “named neurons” who can vote on proposals on their behalf. The theory is that such a system can be self-regulated and self-improving since experts will develop followings and named neurons will upgrade the protocol over time.

The problem with the system as currently designed is that no-one is properly incentivized to participate in governance. ICP has very few “named neurons” and all its members are doing it as a hobby, part-time so to speak. The most promising - CycleDAO - which had some of ICP’s most luminous technical minds has since fallen into oblivion because its members simply were too busy to vote on important matters.

We have only one named neuron - Synapse.vote [formerly ICPMN] - with members who spend a significant time out of their day debating in the forums. As a result, Synapse.vote has a disproportionate amount of the voting power. But it too suffers from the same problems as CycleDAO. There’s only so much time that Synapse.vote members can really take out of their day to focus on governance issues.

As a result, ICP’s governance is overly centralized and filled with apathetic voters who want their token to moon but can’t be bothered to do the work to improve the system.

The problem of governance in ICP can be said to fall into the category of the Tragedy of the Commons. When folks are not individually incentivized enough to improve the system as a whole, often the system languishes. It’s the reason why we need the government to build roads and we can’t rely on private individuals to build them.

The second problem besetting ICP today is that there is low demand from dApp developers and end users to use ICP. One could spend all day wondering why that is. The spectacular flop during launch? The poor performance of the Dfinity marketing team? The manipulation of bad actors to thwart Dfinity’s tech? Probably the answer is all of the above, but ultimately it does not matter. What matters is that we are here now and have a big problem to solve to get the world to pay attention to us.

`Why does this matter?`

If ICP does not fix the demand side of the equation, it will fade into oblivion. And if ICP cannot fix the incentive to participate in governance, the protocol will not autonomously upgrade itself. After all, the DFINITY Foundation expects its voting power and influence over the network to decrease over time.

It is definitely not a foregone conclusion that demand generation will just pick up on its own, or that voters will spend half their day making meaningful contributions in the forums, and it is simply a sad fact that the best technology does not always win.

The Internet Computer community should not be complacent. The protocol has suffered from a year of disastrous PR and collapsing token price. Many in the media don’t even know about all the incredible things happening on ICP.

Today ICP enjoys a technical superiority that may not last. Well funded competitors such as Solana, Avalanche, Aptos or Mysten may use their war chest to upgrade its technology and take over ICP’s technical lead.

Peter Thiel is famous for saying the following:

“Superior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation.”

Proposed Solution: An NNS Treasury + NNS Foundation

ICP holders today have a superior product with inferior distribution. If we fix distribution, we have a chance at winning.

By inferior distribution, I mean ICP has been unable to appeal to a broader audience. ICP needs to focus on growth to expand its appeal and improve incentives among the following constituents:

* Application Participation [NOT ENOUGH DAPPS]
  * Developers
  * End Users of applications
* Protocol Participation [NOT ENOUGH GOVERNANCE]
  * Stakers
  * Named Neurons

We believe we can achieve this goal of growth through the creation of an NNS treasury + an accompanying NNS controlled foundation.

`NNS Treasury`

The NNS controls everything to do with ICP including its monetary policy. If it wants to, the NNS can mint ICP through inflation out of thin air.

By creating a treasury controlled by the NNS, the NNS could endow itself with resources to spur growth. Some examples could include:

* Demand Generation
  * Marketing
  * Branding
  * Developer or End user acquisition
* Governance Participation
  * Paying members of named neurons to vote
  * Paying developers to implement community driven proposals

Should we consider driving decentralization as part of the scope of the treasury? Perhaps. This should be subject to discussion from the working group as it’s a tricky question.

`How Would Such a Treasury Get Funded?`

There are three options to fund such a treasury:

1. Increase inflation of all neurons
2. Reduce staking rewards from all neurons while keeping inflation constant
3. Reduce the staking rewards from only non-voting neurons (or another group of neurons)

The benefit of the third option, as proposed from @Kyle_Langham, is that this funding mechanism does not penalize voters who are engaged in governance. As such, it aligns incentives to get neurons to properly participate.

`How Big Could an NNS Treasury Be?`

The potential to raise funds that could be put to a productive use is enormous given how valuable the NNS is ($1.57 billion worth of ICP staked at current value). The proposal to redirect ICP from non-voting neurons could in theory place 1M ICP a month into a NNS treasury without increasing the overall pre-set inflation rate of ICP (10% going down to 5% over 10 years). 1M ICP a month is $6M a month. That’s a lot of money! Just imagine how many great initiatives could be funded with such a large honey pot accumulating…

`Potential Problems with NNS Treasury`

While the potential for growth with such a war chest is huge, so too is the potential for abuse. Cryptocurrency is rife with fraud. One cannot go a single day without reading about a hacker or an imposter stealing funds.

It is a foregone conclusion that bad actors will try to claim NNS treasury funds for themselves. Maybe an OFAC state-sponsored group assumes a false identity to get funding.

It is naive to assume that a war chest of funds can be allocated to anonymous groups. We live in a world of regulators who insist on KYC and AML procedures to make sure bad actors don’t get funding.

It is also hard to think of how accountability and transparency of funds could be enforced in a system whereby an NNS treasury existed in isolation. Let’s say a good faith actor was able to claim funds but spend them inefficiently. Who would be there looking over their shoulder to determine if they had spent the funds as they said they would?

And then finally, one would be remiss to not mention the risk of inflation getting out of control. If the NNS voted to increase inflation in order to fund the NNS treasury, that could have a disastrous impact on the price of ICP.

Ultimately, the prudent thing to do would be to start the treasury small and iterate from there. But starting small is still not sufficient. We need proper oversight to prevent fraud.

`NNS Foundation`

It is our view that an NNS treasury cannot work without a foundation that works alongside it to oversee its operations – with full time employees who are properly trained and incentivized to do the work.

Such a foundation would be dedicated to growth and to overseeing the proper functioning of the NNS, including the treasury.

The foundation would make sure that a bad actor doesn’t get funding. That grant recipients are who they said they are. And they would be subject and accountable to the NNS itself.

`Potential Problems with NNS Foundation`

Of course, adding in an NNS Foundation has the potential to massively centralize the power of the NNS into a single body.

Additionally, it is unclear to us at this time whether it is truly possible to create an institution that is answerable to the NNS as it lives off-chain. The code is not law in the real world and people can choose to break the laws of the institutions we set. We can say that the leader of this foundation must be elected by the NNS every four years, but what does that actually mean if they flout those rules and get away with it?

Any design must keep this in mind and have checks and balances. Perhaps it is better to not call it “The NNS Foundation” but rather the first of many foundations that the NNS can help fund and support. That way the foundation does not need to pretend to be official but rather just a private organization that is contributing to the goal of the Internet Computer much like Dfinity. Given the DFINITY Foundation does plan to decentralize various components of the organization over time, this could (and eventually will) be one such decentralized component.

Whatever the design, what is clear is that the establishment of a foundation would require a lot of work. That’s the whole point. Whoever is up for the task of making this a reality needs to make it a full time role. What that person looks like could again be a good topic for the working group.

`Summary`

To re-state, the problem facing the ICP ecosystem is twofold:

1. The incentive to upgrade ICP by meaningfully participating in governance is low
2. The demand from dApp developers and end users to use ICP is well below what the Internet Computer is capable of

We believe NNS can turn both of these around by resourcing itself with a treasury that makes inflation productive. All that said, a new foundation will need to be set up dedicated to growth to ensure that the treasury is not abused.

All these are just ideas to further the growth of a NNS treasury. Ultimately a working group will need to be established to hash these ideas out and land on a consensus. With great resources come great responsibility and the only chance this has of succeeding is if there is general buy-in from the community.

[/quote]

Why would making inflation productive be more beneficial than reducing inflation? And for the neurons that are so uninvolved that they don't harvest their maturity, is it a problem that needs to be solved?

I feel like the IC cannot engineer its way to greater use, and it has done too much of this already. Marketing and education are what is needed, and I have a hard time seeing how handing money to the NNS will help this.

jwiegley | 2022-10-10 21:15:00 UTC | #4

Do you mean the NNS would somehow contract with an external organization to perform marketing for the IC? That requires a lot of interactivity and coordination; would the NNS nominate an agent on its behalf to do that work? How would the quality of the work be measured, and what if the agent's work is sub-par? This seems like a very inefficient way to fund what must be highly engaged work. I think it is better if the Foundation spearheads such an effort, than a decentralized agency managed by public proposals...

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-10-10 21:28:55 UTC | #5

Dfinity does not need to be the only foundation that does this type of work. The NNS could create a new foundation funded from its treasury to do marketing. 

How does one measure the quality of the work of the new Foundation? These are important and tricky questions to answer. But just because it is hard doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered. 

The NNS has a vast pool of capital. Dfinity's resources are limited and dwindling. Now might be the time to birth one or more foundations with very limited inflation.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-10-10 23:38:49 UTC | #6

At the moment, I'm having trouble seeing how the IC achieves decentralization without incentivizing people and organizations to become contributors to the IC.  I think an NNS treasury can be used to fund experts who have the skills to review replica updates, bounties for people to deliver governance changes and roadmap, incentives for named neurons to actively participate in governance, R&D that is focused on decentralization, as well as growth and marketing.  I think the NNS should fund multiple organizations that perform the coordination and highly engaging work that these tasks require.  At this time, the community turns to DFINITY for everything related to a roadmap, but I don't see any reason why other organizations can't develop their own roadmaps and make valuable contributions to the IC.

That said, I do have a hard time seeing how this would work if a decentralized agency is micromanaged by public proposals.  It seems there should be organizations that form as non-profit legal entities that are empowered to micromanage their own day to day operations while somehow still having accountability to governance participants.

I would argue this can be boiled down to one simple fact (potentially controversial in these forums).

**Right now, the IC has many Dapps, but not one of them is a value-add magnet for its users.**


This means for the average person (not crypto nerd) living through a global recession, war tensions, and inflation, a product that reduces customer costs or makes their lives more efficient, convenient, or secure (while not having overburdening UX). 

Hype is not value. Promise of growth is not value. Tangible, current utility is value.

Early adopters have funneled money into NFTs, and the ICP token (8 year stake), but the bear market has destroyed many of these investments (in the short term), sucking value out of IC users/investors since genesis.

* The IC has many NFT collections and dapps - these are 95%+ value-suck
* We have social media applications, that facilitate discussion (value-neutral, relatively low-user counts & IC performance/storage limitations prevent from benefiting through network effects)
* Developer Tooling/Infrastructure (boosts dev productivity and potential value-add, but this has not yet been fully realized by any app)
* Wallets and identity applications (value-neutral until cross-chain enabled)
* The closest value-add applications we have currently are games, content-moderation platforms, and site-builders/blogging sites. Still, these currently add **minimal** value.

Taking the value sum of all applications, the scale is (currently) heavily weighted in the direction of applications that suck value out of the IC.


To reiterate, the IC needs an application that either reduces cost, improves efficiency & convenience, or provides a unique IC functionality not found in web2 or executed in other crypto projects, that either tens of millions of people, or big money interests actually receive additional value from (pump and dump doesn’t count).

If a project can follow-through on this, then we’ll see a turnaround in the price of ICP.

I like this idea in a particular good suggestion. I think this group should consist of legal entities from every area (or as many as possible) that the IC operates in the best represent all of their best interests and allow these individuals a chance to argue and debate amongst themselves and then deliberate to their communities of/from their area so those users can make the best decision for them based on their geographical location.

In my opinion, to solve the two problems you've mention cannot not be done with NNS Treasury & NNS Foundation, if the ICP weird tokenomics is still broken. Till today, there's no meaningful response from the dfinity foundation to address the issue, nor to show the tokenomic research paper defining the 'formula' & 'number' behind the tokenomics design. All just based of assumption with no 'real' number backing it up.

This was no issue a year ago at genesis launch, because some investors still put hope & confidence that the tokenomics works, and give it more time to have some data to prove. But, it has been more than a year,  and the data & number showing are not convincing.

Before proposing like NNS Treasury & NNS Foundation, we need to fix the tokenomics first.
If the tokenomic is convincing, the ICP price will stabilize and grow. If the ICP price is appreciating, it will be an easy job to onboarding many developers & increase governance participation. It is very hard to market protocol that is declining in value with no sign of fixing from the fundamental side.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2022-10-11 02:57:59 UTC | #10

The problem with the tokenomics is that it only is beneficial with more adoption. If adoption never comes the price will dwindle and the project will have a slow demise. 
The biggest problem for price right now is the inflation of the circulating supply and I don’t think anybody has proposed any reasonable solutions. I think dfinity is in a pickle which is the reason why they decided to stay silent. If they can’t get enough adoption on this platform, the result will be a slow death spiral.

The NNS treasury should function similar to how the ENS DAO works.

https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-0/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules

Their DAO breaks up responsibilities into Working Groups that are managed by Stewards.  Working groups perform a function, such as `Ecosystem Working Group` which has many purposes but one of them is hosting Hackathons to help grow the ecosystem.  The `Ecosystem Working Group` is provided financing from the treasury (and in our case the NNS treasury) to pay for these Hackathons as well as give wages to the Stewards since this requires time out of someone's day to manage.

Stewards are elected by the NNS to be officially part of these working groups and receive compensation for their work defined by the proposal for the working group.

If you find this interesting I would look at the proposals for their working groups.

Meta-governance
https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep7.1-executable-q1-and-q2-2022-meta-governance-wg-budget

ENS Ecosystem
https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep7.2-executable-q1-and-q2-2022-ens-ecosystem-wg-budget

Community
https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep7.3-executable-q1-and-q2-2022-community-wg-budget

Public Goods
https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep7.4-executable-q1-and-q2-2022-public-goods-wg-budget

These are the Q1/Q2 working groups and in Q3/Q4 some of these groups have received a 20x increase in budget.

The current proposal we have gives an example of providing marketing for the IC, this could be within a working group that is given budget to market externally and onboard new users and improve distribution.

If we adopt a similar system and pair up elected people from the community with DFINITY employees to help steward these working groups, I believe we will have a measurable way to determine if NNS funds are being properly budgeted as well as determine the ability of these stewards of executing their working groups given function.

Hard to disagree with any of these points made. I would also add to it that there is **no case studies of viable revenue models**. 

There have been a number of projects I have looked at investing in but none have been able to show how they will generate revenue over time. I would love to know if there have even been any examples of theoretical ones proposed. Selling continuous series’ of NFTs to pay for cycles may be viable but I am yet to see anyone even discussing this with respect to dAPPs.

Is the presence of a clear dAPP revenue model even a weighted criteria when giving out funding because if it isn’t it should be.

ICPMN has never made any proposals

No proposal that I have made that touch on tokenomics has been implemented

ICPMN voted NO on all spam proposals

ICP investors do not earn rewards for staking, they earn rewards from voting.

I have put a lot of time and energy trying to spread the word about tokenomics changes that were implemented by DFINITY.  Those changes were very effective at moving us in the direction of decentralization, which in my opinion is a positive outcome.  

Ironically, in spite of your willingness to complain you have never tried to educate people about those changes.  Why don’t you help spread the word so we can achieve one of the ultimate decentralization goals…100% voting participation without default following?

-------------------------

Choiseongin | 2022-10-11 13:11:04 UTC | #15

I agree. dfinity has to admit the failure and start over properly. It's not a shame to set it up right. Groundless tokennomics will keep icp sick.

[/quote]

I want to add some clarification here. I am very in favor of starting a discussion about an NNS treasury, but I don't resonate with the main benefits of the treasury being a solution to these two problems. These may be problems that we have as a community, and perhaps an NNS treasury will help to some extent, but I'm more interested in the holistic and possibly unknown benefits of the NNS having its own power to effect changes as it sees fit, independent of DFINITY.

I believe that an NNS treasury would provide a great step towards the decentralization of the leadership of the Internet Computer, possibly in protocol development and grant giving. An NNS treasury with the power to issue its own grants is what I am most interested in. And disclosure, I have hopes that Demergent Labs or myself could receive some of those grants someday.

Personally, I would want the NNS to focus on grants that enable projects that are a step or two below the application layer. Protocol layer concerns, open source projects without sound business models, basically what Demergent Labs is working on. Many projects that raise money have to focus on the demands of their investors. It's much harder to just receive money to build what needs to be built. I hope the NNS will focus on these types of projects.

But besides the focus, I think we first need to agree on:

1. That an NNS treasury should exist
2. How the NNS treasury will be governed

For governance, I recommend we design a legal entity that is legally and in reality controlled by the NNS. For example, written into its bylaws or operating agreement, and enforced by the NNS itself, would be rules governing all funds. Salaries will not be able to be withdrawn without the consent of the NNS. The NNS can fire and hire at its will. We will have to carefully consider how to construct this entity.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-10-11 17:17:05 UTC | #18

Though I'm not sure more marketing is what we need, I really resonate with the idea of decentralizing the core leadership and source of funds for protocol leadership. DFINITY is really the only major contributor to the IC right now. Let's get some more of these entities. I hope some will naturally arise as dapps become profitable, but shouldn't the NNS be able to govern itself and issue its own funds? Right now only DFINITY has that power. The NNS is really beholden to DFINITY in material ways.

It may be essential to have a legal entity. And I believe that entity should ultimately be controlled by the NNS. All authorization of funds should ultimately be controlled by the NNS. The leadership of the legal entity should be controlled by the NNS.

Overall I think this is as positive step and I have other concerns and that comes down to a strategy of adoption.

Having a clear and researched view of how the IC intends to achieves it's ultimate goal is paramount ie. A business plan.

Having this in place should essentially give us an idea of where we would see natural demand for the ICP token coming from, not taking into consideration speculation.

What is the strategy of adoption? And how attainable is the overall goal.

Having a step by step implementation plan would be incredibly useful imo and something the community could lean on for guidance.

First step being -  which features does the IC currently have that differentiates from our competitors, which could help to bootstrap growth in the short to medium term? 

Leading on from this, what is the value proposition of web 2 Vs web 3, which really affects the end consumer or an entreprise business? And how can this promoted? 

Sometimes I feel this project has extremely ambitious end goals but literally no plan in place on how to get there

Heres a rough first guide on how I see things progressing

1. First killer use case. BTC and ETH intergradation - as this is taking longer than expected - should there be more resources allocated? Getting this overline is critical. We all know that so whats being done about it. If BTC is nearly done then how long until ETH?

What can be done the devise usecases for the above?  Can the gigabrains at Dfinity help? Are we reaching out the Ethereum community for advise?

Can grants be substantially more allocated to help create a vibrant development in this area. I think we could do better here to bounce ideas and engage with external communities

Overnight we could tap into two of biggest liquidity pools and probably the most accessible.

2. Inticing experienced teams of developers, to try and create companies, which actually create real revenue and not just amateur outfits who want to profit from boom and bust / get rich quick token launches. This comes down to clear explanations of the value add of building on the IC and also web 2 Vs web 3 usecases. More of a slow burner but worth the effort due to sustainable income in the long run and more chance of creating a viral application.

3. Entreprise - what is being done here to see whether this is actually a viable use-case?

I don't see any partnerships or at least any interest from commercial businesses looking or at least researching building on the IC

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-10-11 23:52:24 UTC | #22

I like the idea of committee neurons. Are you still working on that @lastmjs?

To add to this, I would think having more macro, geopolitical and philosophical minded people engage in the discussion on the future of governance, tokenomics and the IC in general makes a lot of sense. And it might offer insights hard technical minded people overlook. To become an actual world computer requires collaboration on a broad spectrum of subjects with a diverse range of contributors. Each specialist in their subject can add value by their specific knowledge base, but next to that, to have these specialists communicate with each other and synthesize better development of the IC through their combined knowledge seems ideal. And through this forum (and maybe a future governance discussion dApp (Civol?)) us plebs can add some bottom up liquidity of ideas.

All in all, whatever happens, I think most of us prefer solid structural changes and quality discussion to quick fixes and emotional reasoning.

This resonates with me as well. Fundraising takes time away from building and has lasting effects.

I think the above proposal has the potential to maximally align people who want to see the platform succeed with projects that are adding value.

In my experience, doing something atypical that adds unique value also means encountering unique challenges and therefore takes longer to get the type of traction investors typically want to see.

I think it would be a shame if projects like Demergent Labs couldn’t continue as they have been due to funding concerns, but unfortunately I can also see how easily that could happen unless we decide to try something new.

MillionMiles | 2022-10-18 01:36:42 UTC | #25

I think we must clarify the individual purpose of  Dfinity Grant, Community fund and NNS treasury.

From my perspective:

**Dfinity Grants**: Support developer and early project, like Demergent Labs.

**NNS treasury**: Support NNS governance, like proposer, influencer, advisor... (maybe we need a reputation system, like Dfinity forum bage system.)

This was **not** what I was expecting funds to be used for.  There are plenty of for-profit companies that need to do marketing and influencing.

DFINITY grants have a bit of a gate on them...it isn't the biggest hurdle, but having an independent group giving these grants opens things up and gives more freedom to try riskier objectives and unaligned projects.  As the NNS's purpose is to enhance the long-term value of the network, I expected that it would be used for that - funding the code and infrastructure that makes the network stronger.  To the extent that PR is involved, I'd assume it would be things like EF DevCon where code is at the center but also provides a rallying point.  We don't need a bunch of twitter bots developed to pump ICP.

While being quite active in the area mentioned (education & development), this will be my first post dedicated to governance. 

I disagree that the incentives to participate in governance, education and open source buildings are non-existent. 
The incentives are called social reputation, human & political capital and indirect financial capital by contributing to the expansion of the ecosystem. 

Baking into the NNS a direct way to fund people that actively participate in the governance is a slippery slope. 
I also want to see more organisation supporting tooling, education & community building but we need build to real value to fund that otherwise it just feels like we are shuffling existing value around.   

If the NNS is to evolve into one of the most crucial political instance in the world, I would really take my time to introduce such changes. We might be taking decision that will have lasting impacts for generations. 
I'm already concerned by the SNS having to go through the NNS. The NNS shouldn't be creating a pyramidal system for the ecosystem. 

To end with some nuance, I do think the idea is at least worth being discussed (maybe more than that it would also need to be "experimented" for a few times) but it highly depends on where the money is coming from and how decentralized the funding system is going to be. 
Please take time. Whatever happens this won't be a game changer. 
The ecosystem is also limited by the current lack of human capital not only financial one and this treasury won't solve the first bottleneck.

This is a great point and it is one place where adopting "rough consensus and working code" can help.  Few people have a problem funding the building of code. If governance is code then we have a much more direct and simple way of funding it.

These are great questions to be answered in a working group.  I look at this proposal as an idea for consideration, but all details would be worked out in one or more working groups.  The outcome of the working group(s) would be one or more proposals to the NNS for approval.  I would imaging the working groups would include an open call for working group participants,  published meeting minutes, and published video recordings.  There may even be intermediate NNS proposals to verify direction of the working groups.

The only profitable dapps on ethereum are stablecoins and exchanges, followed by the ENS. 

If the question is "how do we develop profitable apps on the IC?"

The answer is: A rational starting point towards developing profitable dapps on the IC is starting with a proven model ie. launching exchanges and stablecoins native to the IC, followed by a DeFi ecosystem native to the IC. DeFi is a proven model for profitable apps and service on Ethereum. The building blocks necessary for DeFi apps are exchanges and stablecoins. Currently there aren't any DeFi apps functioning on the IC besides swapping amm's, there aren't any exchanges (leveraged trading, perps, options, yield vaults, etc.) or native IC stablecoins (algo, asset backed, collateralized). 

Reaching out to existing DeFi apps and services on other blockchains, and offering them funding to launch their apps on the IC might be one strategy. Most popular dapps are multichain already, so facilitating ways to deploy existing DeFi dapps onto the IC might be worth exploring. 

Another strategy towards DeFi ecosystem growth on the IC might be through SNS, or a grants programs to fund new teams to build DeFi apps and services on the IC. A targeted fund for DeFi apps would be beneficial. 

Then once a DeFi ecosystem native to the IC is established leveraging the momentum gained from that to explore other more experimental revenue models for non-defi related dapps, and new types of DeFi apps that can only be built on the IC.

However, a flourishing DeFi app ecosystem on the IC is a pre-requisite because it brings new liquidity, userbase, and capital to fund other types of innovative non-defi dapps and services. It also provides a user base familiar with the IC ecosystem from using DeFi apps to onboard into these new non DeFi apps. 

Ethereum is a great case study illustrating this point. Non-defi apps and services are being developed and explored on Ethereum, but having a functioning DeFi ecosystem was a pre-requisite for the growth of these non-defi apps. 

Thus first achieving a growing DeFi ecosystem on the IC, increases the probability of subsequently creating a profitable non DeFi app ecosystem on the IC. Without first developing a DeFI ecosystem, it is more difficult to create a profitable non-defi profitable app ecosystem. 

Regarding funding the NNS treasury:

I would agree that following a working group model similar to the ENS might be beneficial, however, funding for this can come from individual grants, an NNS treasury doesn't seem like the optimal way to provide funding for NNS governance. I don't see why this effort and funding mechanism needs to be derived from funds coming from the NNS.

There is already a grants program in place from the Dfinity foundation to fund new apps, a Community SNS Fund for apps. And other funding platforms not associated with the NNS where people can request funding for their governance, tooling and community building ideas. 

Building this functionality into the NNS and forcing funds to be allocated to this, will create an opportunity for misallocation of resources and grifting. 

If there is a need to fund governance in order to support: **tooling, education & community building** 
 then there are already plenty of crowdfunding platforms on the IC like crowdfund nft, or even the SNS to fund projects in a decentralized manner. Or develop new apps similar to gitcoin etc. Funds can be raised for these projects through community members individually giving ICP grants, donations, etc. There are plenty of ICP organizations with independent funds available to contribute to these types of projects.

The NNS Treasury is an inspiring idea. After reading everything written here and listening to the Town Hall I decided to write [a brief specification](https://civol.app/news/ic-projects) outlining a radically new solution for it based on Civol. I'm calling it ***IC Projects*** for now. We could have a prototype up and running very quickly. In case you're new to Civol, it's an asynchronous video forum for decentralized collective decision making that runs entirely on the IC, here's [a demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/46f13e5d2ee74a88a104139289eaa514).

The idea behind the Civol IC Projects solution is that software projects need not consist entirely of dry code, text and diagrams. The project teams are real people with hopes and dreams. They will be proposing innovative solutions to real IC problems and then put their reputations on the line to build those solutions with the clock ticking and limited resources. 

Civol enables the basic problems of project evaluation and tracking to be completely transparent and decentralized. No need for formal working groups or additional foundations, both of which are centralizing and expensive. Everyone who wants to speak and contribute can do so.

An important point I failed to mention in the spec is that voters and speakers who contribute to the discourse during these project evaluations will receive token rewards. That means people who are actively involved in the evaluation will be compensated for their time, expertise, and energy. With up to 6M flowing into the Treasury every month it's the least we can do. :upside_down_face:

I will try to go through this topic again and comment on how Civol IC Projects can help solve specific problems people are expressing. I look forward to your feedback on the spec!

Synapse.vote has a disproportionate amount of the voting power. But it too suffers from the same problems as CycleDAO. There’s only so much time that Synapse.vote members can really take out of their day to focus on governance issues.

As a result, ICP’s governance is overly centralized and filled with apathetic voters who want their token to moon but can’t be bothered to do the work to improve the system.
[/quote]

[Civol](https://www.loom.com/share/46f13e5d2ee74a88a104139289eaa514) can actually change this dynamic, starting with [IC Projects](https://civol.app/news/ic-projects). If the Treasury grows at 6M per month, or anywhere near that, we will be able to reward everyone, voters and speakers alike, for their contributions to project evaluation, in addition to funding all worthy projects. 

People who will not engage in NNS governance will in fact engage in the real life drama of projects struggling to be funded and deliver on their promise. This will be true especially when engagement means watching smart people work together on video to solve problems and create serious tech, and voting your level of resonance with everything they say.

If ICP does not fix the demand side of the equation, it will fade into oblivion. And if ICP cannot fix the incentive to participate in governance, the protocol will not autonomously upgrade itself. After all, the DFINITY Foundation expects its voting power and influence over the network to decrease over time.
[/quote]

The answer is [Bicameral Governance](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/civol-community-nervous-system/15277#community-nervous-system-3), NNS + Civol CNS (Community Nervous System). NNS can remain focused on protocol governance. It need not suffer because it's incapable of supporting motion proposal evaluation and roadmap governance. The Civol CNS is designed to handle those, while greatly increasing decentralization and voter participation as it does so. 

Bicameral Governance and Civol as an **unprecedented dapp** will demonstrate what the IC is truly capable of, and that will in turn bring with it the all critical increase in awareness and therefore demand.

It is also hard to think of how accountability and transparency of funds could be enforced in a system whereby an NNS treasury existed in isolation. Let’s say a good faith actor was able to claim funds but spend them inefficiently. Who would be there looking over their shoulder to determine if they had spent the funds as they said they would?
[/quote]

This is exactly what Civol [IC Projects](https://civol.app/news/ic-projects) is designed to do, make everything decentralized and transparent. Project teams clearly state their plan and budget. If they are then capable of bringing the Community to consensus on the worthiness of their project they will be funded. Once funds are distributed and work begins, the Community will be able to follow the team's progress using the same Civol UX that they used to evaluate the project in the first place. And if at the end of the day the project fails the Community will know why and certain reputations may suffer. On the other hand, successful projects will cause their team's reputations to soar. The incentive will clearly be to impress the Community with excellent work.

It is our view that an NNS treasury cannot work without a foundation that works alongside it to oversee its operations – with full time employees who are properly trained and incentivized to do the work. Such a foundation would be dedicated to growth...
[/quote]

As pointed out subsequently, an NNS Foundation would be a centralizing force that would also be difficult to police. It would also be expensive to operate. In short, an NNS Foundation sounds extremely problematic for an organization whose ideal is decentralization, and fortunately it won't be necessary with the advent of Civol [IC projects](https://civol.app/news/ic-projects). 

Instead, the same (or similarly qualified) people who would speak behind closed doors to make decisions on behalf of the Community can speak publicly on Civol and allow the Community to vote on what they say to thereby make its own decisions. And instead of one small group making all the project funding decisions the entire Community will be able to speak if and whenever it wants to, with all such speakers rewarded for their contributions on a piecemeal basis. 

The way to safeguard the Treasury and ensure the best projects are funded from it is to put the Community in charge, and with Civol IC Projects this becomes possible. Decentralized, transparent, and trustless are the system attributes we seek. Why not give Civol a chance?

LightningLad91 | 2022-10-21 00:47:29 UTC | #42

I really like everything you said in this post. Reading through your proposal on IC projects I think it could be a really useful tool.

My problem with moving forward is that we, as a community, haven’t identified the scope of the problem. For example, your description of IC Projects lists options ranging from infrastructure to video games. Is the purpose of the treasury to fund any project we find interesting, or is the purpose to fund open source contributions to the network? 

Identifying an NNS Treasury as the solution before we’ve even agreed on the problem is wrong.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-10-21 02:48:06 UTC | #43

Hi @LightningLad91, thanks so much!

Regarding scope... To me if the Treasury will be receiving millions per month, as suggested, or even a fraction of that, the Community should be able to fund whatever it wants to fund on an ongoing basis, which is why I laid out the entire spectrum of possible verticals. If the budget is there why limit the Community in any way?

The dream is for the Community to be able to make decisions in a totally decentralized way, and we can start with decisions on **funding new projects. This is the way to grow the IC**, to attract new developers and dapps from these other competing chains. DFINITY can't do it all, and they too dream of decentralized governance solutions that take some of the heat off themselves.

In short, *I don't think the purpose of the Treasury needs to be limited to tooling or infrastructure projects that don't have a revenue model*. With a Treasury of many millions the Community can easily fund any and all worthy projects, whether they make money or not. If there's a compelling case for a project it should be funded. Civol IC Projects coupled to a Community Treasury appears to be an amazing opportunity to make this dream come true, and I bet it will attract new builders to the IC in droves! :zap:

What we need on the IC is something truly new, something that rocks the Cryptoverse, something that gets everyone in the industry talking, a true breakthrough that is built on the IC and that changes the game. I think Civol IC Projects is capable of delivering that... The IC Community will get Civol and its decentralized governance capabilities, but they will also get this amazing new decentralized project funding mechanism that offers all projects a clear path to life! All a project has to be is worthy, and Civol enables the Community to determine that in a completely decentralized trustless way.

Please let me know if this makes sense, and thanks again!

LightningLad91 | 2022-10-21 03:11:01 UTC | #44

I fully respect your position on this. My point is that it’s not enough for any of us to opine about this on the forums and then decide that an NNS treasury is required.

If we believe there is a problem that requires the NNS to take action then we should clearly state what that problem is and submit a motion to the NNS asking for approval to explore solutions.

Until then, the NNS Treasury / NNS Foundation is a solution looking for a problem.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-10-21 04:39:04 UTC | #45

Not to belabor the point, but @dfisher and @wpb describe the problem pretty well. It's basically a lack of growth, which is allowing other arguably inferior chains to attract devs who should be migrating to the IC. To their problem statement I would add Dom's recent revelation that IC Awareness stands at 0.5% in the industry. I could hardly believe that, and I think we have to acknowledge it as a very serious problem. 

However, a lack of awareness of the IC is not really a problem the NNS can do anything about, except perhaps to authorize the Community Treasury to be created along the lines suggested. However, that will take time, and I think the only way it can possibly be justified would be if there were a powerful decentralized project evaluation system that the Community is convinced to be capable of reliably managing such a Treasury. 

So we have our problem, and it is huge, and I'm proposing a solution, this Civol IC Projects system, and we will need to evaluate it to determine how solid a solution it actually is. And if we agree it is solid, then I think that motion proposal to create the Treasury might at that point be drafted and submitted to NNS for a vote. 

That's what I'm seeing, I hope it seems reasonable.

Isn't bootstrapping / funding new projects what DFINITY GRANTS is doing currently ? 

Is the treasury funding more money to already funded projects from DFINITY GRANTS? It make most sense to me that funded projects that needed more money to progress can get the additional push from treasury. 

Or is it that the treasury is funding money to projects that has failed to get DFINITY GRANTS but the community really like the project idea so much that it can fund it ?

What I don't want to see is developers requesting fund from the treasury to get funded instead of DFINITY GRANTS because it is EASIER to get or MORE FUNDING to get


BTW these are the 2 ideas that I strongly will agree to if ever a NNS treasury would be created.

While I voted in favor of creating an NNS Treasury, I wanted to reiterate here that I do not believe it should ever be directly supported by minting coins (for example, by diverting rewards from non-voting neurons). A treasury is a fine idea, but it should remain decoupled from the money printer that it also manages. This could take the form of funding from the Foundations, applying grants, receiving donations, etc.

The “problem” (as I see it) is that for a number of projects:
* The grants program is not a good fit
  * no money up front
  * limited funding tiers
  * less confidence for recipients about runway
* Traditional investors (angels, VCs) are not a good fit
  * See Jordan’s comments from above:

[quote="lastmjs, post:17, topic:15839"]
Personally, I would want the NNS to focus on grants that enable projects that are a step or two below the application layer. Protocol layer concerns, open source projects without sound business models, basically what Demergent Labs is working on. Many projects that raise money have to focus on the demands of their investors. It’s much harder to just receive money to build what needs to be built. I hope the NNS will focus on these types of projects.
[/quote]

More generally, these also have processes that are decided by centralized entities and depend on a smaller number of people when compared to the broader community.

As for why people haven’t heard that more projects are in need of funding;

My experience is that asking people for money is already quite a humbling experience. I can only speculate that people who have tried and have not yet been successful are concerned with how that looks to other potential investors.

Recently I became aware of some projects that are in this situation and other people have independently had similar conversations with different teams.

Thank you Paul. I understand, and at a personal level I want to support projects like yours and others. I am not against the idea of us coming together to find ways to fund these groups.

The issue (as I see it) is that we have not stated who the intended recipients of these grants are. I have heard everything from public goods, to any project the community approves, all the way up to 4-5 brand new foundations.

Right now I fear that everyone sees an opportunity for money and the community (outside the forums) has no idea what problem is actually being addressed. 

To put it simply, I think we skipped at least one big step in this process and that was getting NNS concurrence on the scope of the problem.

If there is an inflation schedule we all know about since genesis that is designed to incentivize governance participation for the long term best interest of the IC, and it is not all allocated, then why wouldn’t it be good to use those funds to benefit the ecosystem?

I had a chance to meet Roald from Aviate Labs at the Code and State event in LA this week.  @lastmjs and I thought he provided the most succinct answer we’ve heard yet.  If DFINITY were gone, would the internet computer survive?  If the answer is no, then the treasury should fund people and organizations that can contribute to the IC so the answer becomes yes.  The treasury should fund decentralization and growth of the internet computer.

After thinking on this for a while, my position is that we shouldn’t use the scenario you described as our problem statement unless we are prepared to address the problem holistically.

@weedpatch2 proposed a similar hypothetical scenario back in August and I think it’s worth talking about in a working group.

Hi wpb! I meant that today, the voting rewards are X and they get divided among everyone who does vote. The proposal, as I understood it, wanted to scale X based on how many were actually voting, and then divert whatever X-V would have been to the Treasury. Hence, money that would go to me today as a "voting member in the presence of non-voting members", would instead be redirected to the treasury. In other words, lack of voting by others would have no bearing any longer on the size of my own rewards.

Thanks @jwiegley.  There may be confusion about this call to action forum topic.  It isn’t a proposal to change tokenomics.  Proposal 80790 was a change to tokenomics and was already deliberated and passed.  This forum topic about an NNS treasury includes recognition of undistributed governance rewards resulting from proposal 80790 as a potential source of funding.  We are not deliberating the tokenomics changes since they already passed.

I was interested in clarification on the idea that governance rewards might be diverted from non voting neurons.  This isn’t possible.  I wouldn’t want to divert rewards that are awarded to neurons.  However, I don’t see anything wrong with using rewards that are undistributed.  Undistributed governance rewards belong to no one yet they are part of an inflation schedule that is already understood by the community.

I'd like to self-promote Cosmicrafts Business Model here, which is based on bringing more users to the Internet Computer and get revenue from NFT trading royalties.

https://twitter.com/cosmicrafts/status/1571831479541403648

Cosmicrafts Proposal aligns with the Free-to-Use and Use-to-Earn model to facilitate user on-boarding, burns ICP/cycles, increase user database and invites them to participate on value projects like Social, Marketplaces, DeFi, Games and other Infrastructure, because the final goal to a thriving ecosystem is to reach Critical Mass.

Now, this Revenue Model doesn't apply to all projects but it is a unique opportunity on the whole Crypto Space because of IC Reverse Gas Fees, which in my opinion it is one of the biggest advantages to open Web3 for more users.

@civolian, I'm quite new to this forum, and I just came across some of your posts in the past day. I took a look at the video demo of your product. However, I don't understand how it is actually capturing evaluations of different alternatives, let alone aggregating those evaluations into a coherent social preference relation, which is what would be required for "direct democracy". 

It seems like there is only a 1-5 sentiment rating on expert video opinions about the vote, which is effectively a vote on the expert voters, rather than a direct vote on the alternatives the experts are presumably talking about. Although this could be great as an indirect form of liquid democracy to support some experts over others when one wants to follow the lead of experts, that appears to be more of a form of representative democracy rather than direct democracy. Are you planning to expand this platform to include direct evaluations by all participants on alternatives too (e.g., to decide how much scarce funding to allocate to a large number of project alternatives)? This is what would be required for the NNS to be used to fund growth when there are many projects competing for the same community / treasury funds.

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 08:21:15 UTC | #65

How many undistributed rewards are there to date?  0.  Because they were all allocated to voters.

The whole concept of non-voters rewards is a false narrative because as you’ve mentioned many times…you have to vote to get rewards.

So we are changing rewards that went to neurons…

We need to stop acting like there was always this undistributed rewards and we should do something with them…this was created by @skilesare with the spam proposal.

wpb | 2022-10-31 10:19:35 UTC | #66

Where did you see me talk about non-voter rewards?  I agree there is no such thing.  Hence, I think descriptions like diverted can be misleading.

I’m glad you have recently discovered that the ICP token is actually intended for governance participation and have decided to get involved.  It would have been nice to have you engaged during the deliberation of prior proposals as well.  You certainly had every right.

I was interested in clarification on the idea that governance rewards might be diverted from non voting neurons.  This isn’t possible.  I wouldn’t want to divert rewards that are awarded to neurons.  However, I don’t see anything wrong with using rewards that are undistributed.  Undistributed governance rewards belong to no one yet they are part of an inflation schedule that is already understood by the community.

What are undistributed governance rewards?  How are they calculated?  How is this different from non-voters rewards?  

My point is they went to voters; you have reduced voters rewards but now we are pretending like there is some undistributed rewards and that it's not related to or equivalent to rewards that either 1) would have gone to voters or 2) is related to non-voters.

I've always been involved in governance.  I just didn't feel the need to speak out because the governance proposals were pretty benign until I saw that you, @skilesare, and @dfisher are 1) taking rewards from voters and 2) attempting to extract value out of the NNS via creation of a treasury.

Dude, I’m getting tired of offering you clarification on all these points.  We keep having the same conversation over and over and over.  The narrative I use is based on NNS proposals that have passed.

You clearly were not paying attention when proposal 80790 was being deliberated and submitted to the NNS.  It has caught you off guard and now you don’t like the implications.  You also think that the Synapse neuron did not vote in your best interest.  This is understandable, but I think Synapse voting members individually believe we made the best decisions with the information we had at the time.  The implications of that proposal and the logic behind why it was needed were clearly spelled out and deliberated by many people on the forum in the open.  However, you and others (some who were actually involved in the deliberation) have now decided that you want a new voice in governance, which I wholeheartedly support.  I encourage you to push the agenda you want to push.  Use the governance system as it is designed to be used.

Here’s a novel idea…why don’t you create a new proposal topic to repeal proposal 80790.  I don’t think it has been implemented yet and even if it has there is nothing stopping you from trying to revert it.  I encourage you to change the narrative in a real way.  Make a proposal that returns us to the narrative you want to be true.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 12:53:39 UTC | #69

You keep talking around the points because you can't or won't address the issues directly.  Undistributed ICP is not a problem that needs solving.  It's either voter rewards or you are tracking non-voters rewards which you keep confirming doesn't exist.

I was supportive of stopping spam and potentially lowering inflation but this forum post by David, which you co-authored, makes it clear you are trying to extract value from the NNS.  

Also, I've now seen that there is no more spam because we reversed the weighting.  So there is no problem to really solve...the incentive to spam is gone!

So either you didn't understand what was causing the spam or your main motivation was to create abandoned/undistributed ICP.  And by bringing the weighting back to 20 you are ensuring you maximize the amount of abandoned/undistributed ICP!

Yes, it was my fault for not paying enough attention to the forums and all the pointless governance discussions that have happened until now.  This is corrected now and I will be a regular here.

Finally, I don't have an agenda and have no issue with Synapse other than it has too much voting power.  I do have an issue with people actively trying to extract value from the network.  So I would implore the rest of the Synapse voting members to consider what their objectives are and what Synapse wants to represent because @wpb and @dfisher are painting a clear objective in this post...and it's not a good one.

Hi @mechaquan ,

I think this is a bit unfair and harsh to @skilesare @wpb . I do not think that either one of them is taking rewards from voters.

At best, one presented a spam proposal that reduces the rewards of non-voters (one which was discussed openly). And even then, it is a motion proposal. The community can agree or disagree with the implementation. It is not like they personally gain from it.

[quote="mechaquan, post:67, topic:15839"]
2) attempting to extract value out of the NNS via creation of a treasury.
[/quote]

Eve though, neither DFINITY nor I think the NNS treasury proposal by @dfisher and others will improve the IC, I think the idea of decentralizing work is a valid one in Web3, and it is not malicious. I think it can be openly discussed without saying the authors are "extracting" or "taking rewards". 

To provide a counter-argument, if there was a proposal to burn half the tokens in the IC or a proposal that burns more cycles, I think evaluating *how much it helps* and *how much it costs* the IC makes sense, but saying "*Oh you just want to burn more tokens because it helps you"* is not a constructive line of design discussion.

Again, this is what they said.  I’m taking this at face value so I don’t think I’m taking I’m taking their suggestion of reducing voters rewards out of thin air.  It’s literally mentioned above in this proposal.

Also, it has been specifically mentioned to me by Kyle that IC Devs has been trying to receive funding for a year and the only way this can be done is via the NNS.  So yes, these projects can directly benefit from it.

Finally, I agree with decentralizing work but we are too centralized at the moment for that decision to be a truly decentralized one.

wpb | 2022-10-31 21:01:43 UTC | #78

You quoted a forum topic, not a proposal.  I wish you would take at face value the responses I have provided to you before.  

Here is one from Taggr…
There are no concrete proposals for the formation of a treasury, how it should be funded, or how it should be used. That is intended to be discussed in working groups and submitted in future NNS proposals. The temperature check proposal for the NNS treasury was simply a straw poll to see if the NNS governing body thought it was worth discussing further so people don't waste their time if it can be known in the beginning that the NNS would reject the idea.

There are lots of ways for us to receive funding(https://icdevs.org/donations.html).  We haven't received "very much", but an NNS treasury is certainly not the only way.  ICDevs is 501c3 and overseen by the IRS. If I try to extract value from it over and above the generally accepted-salary for a non-profit director for a non-profit organization I'll go to jail. To date, I have only been reimbursed for the lawyer fees from setting the thing up.  How we handle our funds is published on our website and we are basically a passthrough for organizing and funding education and open-source public goods software for the internet computer.

I like all ya'll, but I'm not going to jail for this thing.

I feel like I’ve provided answers about motive and intent on Taggr as well.  I don’t expect you to agree with me, but I do wish that you would accept my answers when I provide them.

…I will start with why I think a treasury is important. It gets to your basic question of what problem are we trying to solve. It's important to think about whether or not the internet computer will survive if DFINITY no longer existed. I'm sure everyone would agree that the answer is no today. However, a primary objective is decentralization, so we should not expect that long term DFINITY will be required for sustainability of the internet computer. They consider themselves to be "a major contributor to the internet computer" but I don't think they want to be the only contributor. I think we will have arrived at decentralization when we all believe that the internet computer would survive without DIFINITY. This is not a small task and it will take a long time, but we have to get started. It will require funding of many people and organizations that are working to become contributors to the IC and I believe a treasury is needed to achieve that goal. Hence, a treasury would support decentralization and growth.

Actually, I would say that I have not made my intent for treasury and funding clear.  I’ve spent all my time the last three weeks answering questions that seek clarification on intent and motive and explains details on old forum posts.  I have also been listening to the community and trying to understand different perspectives and opinions.  What I have not been doing is continuing to push the treasury idea.  It did not get the warm reception that I hoped.  

I know a lot of people think the temp check was not successful, but I think it was successful because it was intended to get people talking and help the community arrive at a thumbs up / thumbs down.  I know the NNS vote was thumbs up, but the more meaningful feedback has been all the community discussion.  I interpret that to be thumbs down.  Hence, I’m left with a lack of enthusiasm for pursuing the idea further.  The idea is way too political for me.

-------------------------

Omaxus | 2022-10-31 22:31:51 UTC | #83

**Is a treasury important?**
Yes and it can boost the growth if it is wisely used. I would say it should be used for the growth of dapps not core protocol development. In case of core developmenet this need to be coordinated in one way or the other. 

**Reduce inflation and create treasury fund in one go**
Start with small steps not big ones. Big steps are always more complicated to accomplish in nature then small steps.

**Inflation to pump up treasury**
Never use inflation to boost projects. Most of the project uses transaction fees, donation, etc. Never increase inflation for that purpose.

**DFINITY Twins**
Even if we have another DFINITY TWIN, they have to coordinate their work and should have  the same level of expertise. 

**Scenario without DFINITY realistic**
DFINITY is a non profit organization and its survial is not at risk. If DFINITY cannot survive then no other foundation twin will survive too.

**DFINITY Twin employees**
Someone has to pay the employees, in this case the stakers have to pay them. Makes no sense to me. You pay because you provide a service and this service is consumed by the customer.
Stakers != customer
They invest in project to get in return something else.

As a show of good faith I’d like to work with they key voices here…let’s call it a working group 😂…to build a process and show how this could work…based purely on decentralized community input and support on one, probably small, but tangible problem.

Let’s define a problem that we can really solve and will add value to the network.

I remember the old days when we talked a lot about how staking was burning…and we could create demand for ICP via increasing % staked on the NNS.

I’d love to see some focus on how we bring ICP to the NNS but if there is a specific development need that we could execute I’d be open to that too.

I saw crowdfund had some devs available…we could even setup a funding mechanism there…

Having a reliable revenue model is a must for a dapp, and many crypto investors may also be stuck with the protocol and DeFi's investment logic, which is to create a new valuable asset like gov token.

But I think the difference between a dapp and a traditional crypto project in the past is that there is no revenue model, and Internet computers are designed entirely for dapps, so this is very important. I actually agree with @justmythoughts point.

-------------------------

blockpunk | 2022-11-02 10:08:15 UTC | #87

My concern is that this proposal has passed and in the mental expectation of the community (like me), this unallocated portion of NNS rewards is like going into a black hole where ICP has lowered a portion of inflation forever. (Managing expectations is very important)

And at this point, the mention of using this money again looks like recreated inflation, which may be unacceptable to many people.

Of course, these inflation may have been in ICP's plan, but it was ICP's excessive inflation that gradually lost the community's confidence, they voted 80970 to cut ICP inflation. 

In the NNS Treasury proposal, holders found that previous attempts to reduce inflation did not appear to reduce overall inflation, but only reduced staking yields for someone.

This seems unacceptable.

> 
> Note that I prefer to use the staker rather than voter, since for most investors they are more accustomed to stake that do not require voting and have stable yields, which is the practice of most crypto programs.

It is just an inrease in inflation.
No amount of glossing over can hide that fact.

The highest inflation is caused by stakers. So if someone is not participating in any kind (following other neurons or voting by themself) should never get minted icp in the first place.
That reduce inflation. But by moving the abandoned icp to atreasury fund you just taking it from all, stakers and not stakers. And this is a no go!

ICPeople,

The folks in favor of putting together a working group to discuss a NNS treasury have decided to postpone it. Given just how divisive it was we felt it would be better to wait until we have a fix to more basic problems with our governance. For example, periodic reconfirmation will help with voting power centralization. Once that is solved, we believe people will feel a lot more comfortable re-approaching the subject. 

Over and above this, the FTX implosion has created an immediate need for stability in our network. We should be coming together during these times and not trying to rock the boat too much. 

While I don't love that the conversation was shut down before it even started, I can appreciate that people are afraid of negative unintended consequences and suspicious of people's motives. 

So with that in mind, let's first fix our governance and see how things go. Each SNS will have its own mini treasury which may serve as case studies in how well these things can work in the wild.

Lots of exciting things to look forward to in the very near future. Onwards!

civolian | 2022-11-25 20:34:02 UTC | #90

Hi @Sabr, all great questions, sorry I'm late getting back to you.

The alternatives will be expressed and elaborated on in *xchanges*, which are groups of video posts by groups of speakers. Xchanges are the new form of media that the Civol Player plays. The community votes on each post in these xchanges, and we aggregate and average those votes to form a consensus index. It's direct democracy because everyone votes on everything proposed.

You're right about Civol being like representative democracy, but that doesn't mean it isn't direct democracy, it just means that every issue involves competing experts proposing solutions (just like in an election) and the panelist whose solution is ultimately chosen (after a possibly long campaign (we call it discourse)) effectively becomes the elected representative for that issue. 

So when the community reaches consensus on a proposal it is making a collective decision, and this can be on anything, from whether or not to adopt a constitution for the IC, or to fund a particular project from a community treasury.

I will be publishing a new article soon on Civol Democracy that goes into more detail on these things. Until then, hope this helps.

Thanks for your reply!

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-26 18:11:10 UTC | #91

Thanks for the reply, @civolian. It seems that every video post is essentially a proposal that should be voted upon, so voting for the speaker is basically equivalent to voting for the speaker's proposal, if I understand you correctly. I look forward to reading your upcoming article with additional detail. 

I would also be interested to know if your code is open sourced to external customization, or whether you would personally be interested in adding on functionality to capture a prioritization of alternatives by evaluators, rather than just a binary (yes/no) approval vote function. Prioritization via cardinal or ordinal evaluations is required for all the toughest decisions requiring an allocation of scarce resources across competing alternatives. Approving single-issue proposals in isolation from every other proposal is ultimately quite limited and will never be able to bring true direct democracy to a DAO.

I keep hearing your displeasure about those who just follow and do not vote as they have no skills to understand what they are voting on. You make people feel they are unworthy and therefore do not deserve the rewards they receive.

You claim they just want to see their token moon.

I would suggest programmers are no better as they want to take promised rewards stated on the NNS to all that have invested in their neuron and while you make claim the funds for the IC could dry up your suggestion is create ICP out of thin air and also take millions of dollars from the unworthy to give it to a group of programmers would somehow fix the problems.

This sounds very much like the reason why BTC was created to get away from world governments who create money from thin air and will one day make currencies worthless. So you want to create ICP from thin air as well to give it to a governed group to spend.

You claim that the price of ICP somehow reflects the marketing and unworthy neuron owners but the whole market is down and that is because of the pumpers and dumpers and the media being proven correct that crypto is mainly corrupt.

I suggest that you allow the unworthy neuron owners to get out of their staked neurons and allow them to remove their tokens out of the NNS so we stop offending you but you really need our investment or risk losing millions.

Marketing is just a bunch of claims and possibilities that could be.

Advertising is a service that is available and the reason the unworthy have invested in the IC.

I believe that DFINITY should build the IC as per the road map has promised and large current organizations with large pockets will NOT need the funding from the NNS and burn the cycles that the IC needs to become successful to overcome the problems we face with users login and password and the personal information that is being stolen for ransom on the web systems that have come to an end of their cycle.

We the unworthy that are not able or have the skills that programmers have are here and reading your displeasure and the reasons that you want to take our rewards for your purposes that I am not convinced you have any solutions other than to take your funding to the moon.

I was very inspired by the idea of ​​giving part of the reward to the neuron you follow.
Unfortunately, I don’t know who suggested it first, but the idea is brilliant.
Hi, @diegop. Is it discussed?

**Here is how I see the development of NNS:**
1) part of the reward is given to the neuron you follow.
2) named neurons are reformatted into DAO.
3) a neuron following limit is set, i.e. you cannot follow a DAO that has more than 3% of votes (or 1%). Dfinity will not have a limit, so that in bad times there will always be an opportunity to return to Dfinity.
4) proposals can only come from the DAO.
5) cancel manual voting, obliging to follow the DAO (below I will explain why, describing the full picture)

**Here's what it will give:**
1) DAOs are starting to emerge because there is an economic incentive.
2) Developers and DAOs on other blockchains are starting to move to IC, trying to get their votes in time, because it will be more difficult to do it later.
3) DAOs are trying to get the support of the community, they have their own website, where they show their contribution to the development of IC. Explain why they voted this way and not otherwise. The argument could also be that they came from another blockchain and a list of their ideas. DAOs may not necessarily be developers, they may be:
a) DAOs that check the work of other DAOs
b) DAOs looking for prohibited content.
c) DAOs that create learning content
d) DAOs advising on legal matters.
f) DAOs involved in marketing.

4) Among the DAO, competition for votes begins, which does not give them a reason to relax.
5) DAO reaching the vote limit causes them to increase the price of the token by accepting good offers from other DAOs, as well as offering them help in accelerating development.
6) When any important proposals are made, there is a video discussion among the DAO, discussing security issues, legal and economic implications.
7) proposals can only come from the DAO.
Spam problem is solved. If I follow any DAO, I get guest access to the DAO community. There I can offer my ideas, and DAO rewards for it.
8) The abolition of manual voting will increase the number of DAOs.
It also does not allow a major player to directly influence the voting, he will have to distribute his votes among the DAO.
Also, because of the danger of creating a named neuron (DAO) by a major player, the votes following him will be added to his own votes. This is dangerous.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-11-28 00:01:25 UTC | #94

This is a cool idea, and could lead to the rise of professional DAOs that have a strong incentive to maintain a following. Or it could lead to a system of corrupt "crypto influencers" like we have on other chains that bamboozle people for money. I am not sure which. 

To your point though, before we consider any of this we need reconfirmation of followees and we also probably need caps on followees. We need decentralization embedded into the system more so folks trust it more as its a bit fragile now and can lead to infighting.

This could be a great way to give incentives for known neurons for work like checking replica upgrades. On the other hand, this would need to be carefully designed in order to avoid abuse E.g. we could consider some kind of reputation score that known neurons could build up over time.

in addition. it will also help some neurons to not follow others and vote on their own. This would improve participation. If there  is cost to delegation, the chance of delegation will reduce (which is a good thing).

ICP has a infinite huge inflation, neary 40,000,000 new tokens released per year which is really terrible. And it still has a conitinued seed roud release, Keep everyone being afraid and being far way from it. 
1. the best solution to balance inflation is to increase the cycles burn at 500x times than now which can balance the inflation. Then all the developent supports comes from dfinity funds.

Based on the caculation, if we want to eliminate the inflation, we must increase 500X time cycles burn than now. it’s impossible to reach that goal. only way to decrease one xct to 1000 billions cycles to 10 billions cycles.

Why is it impossible to reach that goal? ICP is a baby.
