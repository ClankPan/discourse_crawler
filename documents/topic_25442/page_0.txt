Is it possible to add support for ICP txs to lookup only by index?

Same as it works for other SNS and ck* tokens: 

`https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/ethereum/transaction/2165`

`https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/3e3x2-xyaaa-aaaaq-aaalq-cai/transaction/172766`


For ICP transactions `?index=1234` only works when tx hash is specified.

OK - `https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/0cd7bc68bb628677d5a5709fd71631a01164c4730d41b3f6b43ef0a18de1840f?index=7468928`
FAIL - `https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/?index=7468928`

I'm really keen for this to!
Currently to generate transaction links in OpenChat we have to calculate the transaction hash, if we could just use the index we could remove a load of complexity.
