Hello, I was just wondering what happened to Achievement Unblocked Results. It has been three days since we were suppose to receive a reply on if we got in or not. This has me worried as me and my team worked on our application for quite some time. I hope they are just a bit late and will soon resolve this, but being that we are left with no updates yet, I am wondering if anyone knows anything. Thanks!
