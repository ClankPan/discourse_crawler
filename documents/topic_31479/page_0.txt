Can someone fork Bitcoin and run the protocol on ICP? I guess you couldn't use asics to mine, but what would it look like?

In terms of ICP's capabilities, it is more suitable to integrate the Bitcoin chain into the ICP system and operate Bitcoin directly through ICP, without the need to FORK a bitcoin.
