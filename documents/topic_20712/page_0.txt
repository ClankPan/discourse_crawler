I have always run `dfx start` in the project folder where dfx.json exists. And then `dfx dpeloy` works fine. But is it possible to run `dfx start` under any directory and then `dfx deploy` any canister under any directory? I got the following error when doing above which I never saw before

```
Installing canisters...
Installing code for canister main_server, with canister ID bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.

```

You're most likely running into what we call 'project-specific replica'. If you remove the `networks` part from `dfx.json` you will always run a system-wide replica and you can deploy to it from any project
