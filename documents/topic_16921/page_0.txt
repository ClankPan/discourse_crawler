Is there any principal id that can be used for token burns? (not account id)

I can give you mine! Iâ€™d be more than happy to hold on to them for you ;)

If you can't delete the tokens for some reason, you can always transfer them to the management principal `aaaaa-aa`, which no one can impersonate
