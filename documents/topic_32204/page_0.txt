From my understanding, untopped canisters get deleted. ICP.AI says that the addresses would be part of the canister's state, which gets deleted, which includes the addresses.

Is this correct?

If you generate addresses for say Ethereum, SUI, etc.. and say the canister's state gets deleted, how exactly does that work?

How do you ensure that canisters have access to those addresses? Is there any risk of losing access due to neglect, like an untopped canister.

The chatbot is wrong. The keys are linked to the canister id and you having access to the canister. IIRC if your canister runs out of cycles your code is uninstalled (AKA the state is wiped), but the record of the canister is not deleted for a long time. If you then later install WASM again after topping it up you will once again be able to access the same assets on other chains or assets you hold in other canisters under your canister's id

Thanks for the clarification.

Another question.... how long exactly until the record of the canister gets deleted?

Some would argue "not deleted for a long time" is still not "long enough".

From the [spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#canister-cycles):
> [..] for a minimum of 10 years. What happens to the canister after this period is currently unspecified.

The problem is: what is a fair price of storing data forever? And especially after the canister has run out of cycles and can't pay anymore. Yes it's not all that much data, but the standards for inclusion in the spec are very high

Thanks.... perfect answer.

I love that you're real about the economics behind forever data storage.

Still 10 years minimum of zero cycles seems reasonable.
