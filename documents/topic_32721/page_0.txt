## TL;DR

* An intermediate solution for incentivising voting neurons, while the long-term NNS-based solution is implemented
* 2 grants for 4 of the most important proposal topics
* Candidates can apply by presenting themselves here
* The community will select who will get the grants
* Grants are disbursed to the selected recipients once a month as long as they provide monthly evidence for their work

## Context & Motivation

As shared in [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increasing-decentralization-reducing-icp-inflation-with-a-single-proposal/30953/92), to increase governance participation and decentralization in the NNS, we propose to introduce *periodic confirmation* and *incentives for actively voting neurons.*

While the final solution for incentivising voting neurons should be independent of any centralized party and built into the NNS, the implementation of such a solution will still take a bit of time. **As an intermediate solution, we propose to start with grants that are provided by DFINITY and given to voting neurons elected by the community.**

This intermediate short-term solution has the following advantages.

* The funded neurons have the resources to already
  * establish a voting process
  * become experts for a proposal topic
  * establish ways to convince potential followers that they do good work, for example by sharing how they verify and vote on proposals
* The NNS community
  * learns more about what is needed to incentivise voting neurons
  * establishes a culture of what is expected from a “good voting neuron”
  * gets to know new voting neurons that can be followed already now or taken into account when periodic confirmation is introduced
* Users who submit proposals, e.g., DFINITY,
  * learn how to better explain and present the proposals’ content by getting more feedback

The goal is that the grants would last roughly long enough for the long-term solution to be implemented, so that (most of) the funded neurons can move to the long-term solution for incentivising voting neurons when it is available.

## Grants - high level

DFINITY will provide 2 grants for each of the following 4 proposal topics that are most critical for the ICP’s security (8 grants in total).

* Protocol Canister Management (as introduced with [this design](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/refine-nns-proposals-topics/32125?u=lara))
* IC OS Version Election
* Participant Management & Node Admin *(we combine two topics here but refer both of them when we say “a topic to vote on” in the following)*
* Subnet management

Candidates can apply in this forum thread if they consider themselves as experts for a particular proposal topic from the above list. For each proposal topic, the community selects 2 candidates. The selected candidates receive their grants monthly in ICP, where the amount depends on the effort required for the chosen proposal topic. Candidates receive monthly grants for up to six months, provided they submit the required verification evidence each month. The grants are disbursed only upon the successful submission of evidence for the prior month.

 In the following we describe each of those steps in more detail.

## Effort / grants

Based on estimates established with the engineering teams we propose the following reward structure:

* **Protocol Canister Management**
  * Effort: ~ 15h / week
  * Grant: $5000 / month
* **IC OS Version Election**
  * Effort: ~15h / week
  * Grant: $7500 / month
* **Participant Management & Node Admin**
  * Effort: ~ 2h / week
  * Grant: $750 / month
* **Subnet management**
  * Effort: ~ 2h / week
  * Grant: $750 / month

***Team grant*:** If you are a large team (e.g., 5+), and you have enough redundancy to be able to commit having at least 3 reviewers per proposal, you can apply for a *team grant*. If you do this and get selected for the grant, you receive $10K / month for protocol canister management, $15K / month for IC OS version election, $1.5K / month for participant management & node admin, and $1.5K / month for subnet management.

## What to do to get the grants

As a selected candidate, you are required to do the following to receive your grants.

* Register in the tool “Submittable” where you will send your monthly reports
* Share the neuron ID of the voting neuron
* With this neuron, vote on at least 90% of the chosen topic
* For each proposal and vote, share on the forum evidence that you verified the proposal by the following steps. If you are a large team that applied for a team grant, at least 3 reviewers should show that they performed the following steps individually:
  * Providing a summary of the proposal
  
  * Providing a reason why you voted to adopt or reject
  * Provide evidence that you verified the proposal, which includes the following
    * For **Protocol Canister Management** proposals
      * (1) Verify the build hash, (2) Look at most commits on a high level, considering the API changes (especially breaking changes), code quality, typical source of vulnerabilities, (3) Do an in-depth review of some commits as time permits

    * For **IC OS Version Election** proposals
      * (1) Verify the build hash, (2) Do an in-depth review of as many commits as time permits
    * For **Participant management & Node Admin** proposals
      * Add or remove node providers (topic participant management): look at least at (1) a proper forum introduction by the new NP (2) self-declaration and Identity documents are uploaded on the wiki (3) hashes of the self-declaration and identity document match the hashes in the proposal (4) if a new region or community, a check in the public chamber of commerce register (if chamber of commerce number is provided)
      * Add or remove Data Centers (topic participant management): look at least at (1) who submitted the proposal (normally only a new NP) (2) an Internet search whether this is a legitimate data center.
      * Update node config (topic node admin): in such a proposal, a node provider sets the number of nodes and the node_type (Gen1, Gen2). Check these against the originally approved node allowance (whether that allowance was approved, and whether it matches the IC Target topology using the [github tooling]( https://github.com/StephanusFischer/decentralization))
      * Add node operator (topic node admin): this proposal sets the allowance for a particular node provider in a specific data center. (1) Check if it matches the IC Target topology using the [github tooling]( https://github.com/StephanusFischer/decentralization). For example, currently such proposals should be rejected as the target topology has been reached. (2) Check whether the node provider-id and data center-id match with the previously submitted proposals (the add node provider proposal, and the add data center proposal)
      * Remove nodes from the network (topic node admin): this is a proposal to remove (unhealthy) nodes from the network. Check whether the nodes are indeed unassigned and not in a particular subnet.
    * For **Subnet management** proposals
      * For node replacement proposals: check whether the nodes are replaced because they are dead/unhealthy or replaced for other good reasons.
      * For other proposals of this topic: check whether the reasoning in the proposal makes sense wrt which proposals need to be adopted in which order.
      
    * If you do not have enough information to make the above checks, report this in your summary of the proposal in the forum.

* To get the monthly grant, submit a form with a link to the forum where you presented your work

## Application process

You can apply for a grant for one or multiple topics from the list above.

**To do so, present yourself in this forum discussion until Friday, July 31st.**

You might want to include the following information about yourself. Overall, you should try to convince the community that you have the knowledge and resources to do the above tasks.

* Your name
* What topic(s) you apply for
* Whether you apply for a *"team grant"*
* Presentation of who you are (e.g., links to LinkedIn, other socials)
* The size of your team
* Relevant experience (overall, in web3, on ICP)
* Technical knowledge (can include links to projects, e.g., on github)
* Why you want to be a voting neuron
* Why you need the grants to do so
* Why you are acting in the long-term interest of ICP
* Why you are interested in the topics you apply for
* Why you remain a voting neuron in the long term, even after the grant is over
* Whether you have some voting principles

## Decision process

From the applications, the community will select 2 candidates for each proposal topic that will receive the grants.

To do so,

1. a NNS motion proposal is submitted for each candidate and topic for which the candidate applied
2. for each proposal, the result is computed as the number of YES minus the number of no votes (#YES-#NO)
3. for each topic, the 2 candidates with the highest results get the grants

If there are too many applications for motion proposals to be practical, there might be a first round of election via another tool.

DFINITY plans to vote for candidates who convincingly show in their application that they are able to do the required verification tasks.

**We are looking forward to many applications and to this next step towards a more active NNS DAO!**

Thank you for starting this discussion @lara.  The CodeGov team has been performing this work for IC-OS Version Election and Protocol Canister Management proposal topics for over a year, so we will apply for at least these two spots.  I am traveling today and cannot submit an official application, but I should be able to do it tomorrow.  

I look forward to seeing others in the community stepping up to perform this work, so I think it’s awesome that DFINITY is taking this approach to enabling the NNS to incentivize these contributions to the protocol.

Thanks @lara. This is a great inititive to further incentivise voting on complex topics that require a significant time investment.

[quote="lara, post:1, topic:32721"]
Based on estimates established with the engineering teams we propose the following reward structure
[/quote]

How many people is this effort calculated for? A single person? Or a team of people?

I don't know the numbers for CodeGov off the top of my head, maybe @wpb can provide more details, but there are a quite a few reviewers in CodeGov now and I'm not sure if this grant level can support all of them.

I think it's sensible to include multiple people in the voting on these proposals, both for specialization and also for redundancy.

There's many layers to the IC stack, in DFINITY we create teams that each specialize in a different layer of the stack and I think it's sensible for developers that are voting on these proposals to do the same thing. Although I think developers should specialize in multiple layers, since they are only reviewing code, not writing it. This can be extended for the different canisters in Protocol Canister Management too.

NNS members will choose to follow these named neurons, so we should encourage choosing non-DFINITY neurons to improve decentralization. If those named neurons are not voting 100% of the time on these topics then that creates an incentive to follow DFINITY instead to maximise rewards. Redundancy helps named neurons ensure that they are voting 100% of the time.

Additionally, the 4 eyes principle also applies to these reviews in my opinion.

Do you agree with applying principles to reviewers? If so, would it make sense to additionally include a mandate of how many people each grant is meant to support? So that bigger teams, such as CodeGov, may potentially apply for a multiple of grants in order to support the whole team?

Excellent initiative to further decentralize the IC. Incentives are extremely important when it comes to token based governance. People's Goodwill should never be relied upon for network security and good governance.

Protocol Canister Management (as introduced with [this design ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/refine-nns-proposals-topics/32125))
[/quote]

@lara will you please confirm that this topic is only intended to cover the one topic that is named Protocol Canister Management and not all the topics that are currently called System Canister Management?  It's a substantially different (lower) number of proposals, so I just want to make sure I understand.  

For the proposals for the canisters listed under Protocol Canister Management in the link, there have been an average of 2.8 proposals per week (max of 6 proposals and min 0 proposals) over the last 13 weeks.

wpb | 2024-07-05 21:38:44 UTC | #7

Hey @Lara,

I finally had a chance to read your full proposal in detail and think about how the CodeGov project could contribute.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like this new grant structure is designed to support an organization such as CodeGov.  The grants that are offered are well below the funding level that would be needed to support the bounties that are offered to our reviewers, and that’s without also considering the administrative burden of the organization.  My sense is that these proposed grants are intended to be offered to teams of 1 – 3 people.  The CodeGov team currently consists of 8 reviewers, 1 marketing manager, and 1 project manager and in the ideal world we would add 4-8 more reviewers to the team to thoroughly cover the full scope of IC-OS Version Election and what is currently called System Canister Management (not just Protocol Canister Management).  Hence, it doesn’t seem appropriate to apply for these grants as a CodeGov organization in the form that they are currently presented.  Instead, I will offer feedback below based on our learnings from performing this work over the last year and then let the conversation go wherever it goes.  If CodeGov as we know it today ceases to exist, then so be it.  It will morph into something new that remains actively involved in NNS governance.  I welcome anyone on our current CodeGov team to add their comments as they see fit and to also form smaller teams to apply for these grants if they feel that fits their interests.  Our team members have put in a lot of work over the last year that would enable them to build a strong resume to justify their candidacy for the grants that are offered, and I would fully support their pursuit of the grants in smaller groups.

To give you a sense of our current bounties, our reviewers are offered $150/hr (max 3 hours per proposal) for in-depth review of IC-OS Version Election proposal commits plus $30 per build hash verification.  Our reviewers are also offered $100/hr (max 3 hours per week) for in-depth review of System Canister Management proposal commits and build hash verification of all proposals plus $15 minimum bounty per proposal.  There are nuanced differences between how these bounties are scoped based on our experience so far with these proposal reviews and an attempt to manage our limited budget appropriately.  There are likely opportunities to open the max hour limits a little wider so our reviewers can go into more depth on the commits with the hours that they are allocated.  There are also opportunities to add reviewers so each reviewer can develop a specialization in different layers of the stack while still covering every commit in aggregate among all reviewers. In both cases, it would require an increase in funding, not a decrease.  For the past 4 weeks (since we started reviewing System Canister Management proposals), the total bounty payouts have ranged between $5k - $8.5k per week depending on how many reviewers have been available, how many proposals are submitted by DFINITY each week, and the difficulty level of performing the reviews.  This does not include the perspective reviewers that have expressed an interest in becoming CodeGov reviewers and who were paid for the work they performed during this trial period (which is now on hold).  

Clearly the bounties that are offered in this new grant program ($5k per month) are very small compared to our existing funding needs, and the expected effort proposed for these grants is significantly larger compared to our current expectations.  These details are so far out of sync that I don’t see a benefit to applying as a CodeGov organization because it would require applying for all proposed grants, that CodeGov is the only applicant, and that we take on more proposal topics…and we would still be underfunded.  I’m not interested in trying to pick the best of the best among our reviewers to form a smaller team because they are all good and have all had their moments of brilliance that manifests during their reviews or their interactions with DFINITY and the community on the forum or GitHub or our OpenChat community.  It’s also not a win-win if CodeGov attempts to apply for all the grants that are offered because a very important and worthwhile goal of this new grant program is to incentivize other people or organizations to participate in technical proposal reviews.  I wouldn’t want to take away from that opportunity.  It’s entirely possible that there are people who have not yet thought to apply for developer grants for the purpose of funding reviews of NNS technical topics who may now make themselves available for this task since it is being offered directly on the forum.  It’s an experiment that I can understand is worth conducting.

From my perspective, having an organization the size of CodeGov where reviewers are not competing for funds enables us to freely collaborate and support each other during our reviews.  The bounties are offered as a very reasonable supplemental income for a modest amount of time commitment to developers who are active in the ICP community.  We currently have 8 Followees for IC-OS Version Election proposals and 5 Followees for System Canister Management proposals, which means our reviewers don’t have to worry about always being on call to perform a review when they have other plans for the weekend / vacation, or the proposal reviews don’t fit with the demands of their day job or core ICP project.  We can easily absorb the burden when individual reviewers are not available to review and vote.  We also find that it only takes one reviewer to find something odd about a proposal to justify rejecting that proposal.  When we have more reviewers, it is more likely that the discovery is made early and communicated internally in time for others to investigate and vote accordingly prior to our Followees reaching consensus on the proposal.  I am also finding that many of our reviewers are very happy to help new reviewers become acclimated to the work process.  There are a lot of conversations about what to look for in a proposal and how best to approach the builds, the commit reviews, the reports, and a variety of ways to automate some of the tasks that are required.  Hence, there are many reasons why an organizational approach can be more favorable than an individual approach.

To be honest, I am concerned that these grants are not right sized for the skill level that is needed for this work.  Reviewing these technical topics is real work that cannot be performed by everyone in the community.  Not only do they need to have developer experience, they also need to have Rust experience (at least for the first two topics listed).  They need to be willing to commit to performing technical reviews on every proposal that is submitted to the NNS for their selected topic no matter what day of the week is it submitted, they need to commit to always voting on those proposals in an educated way, and they need to be willing to document their reviews and justify their vote.  These are minimum requirements to become a credible and effective option as a Followee that people in the ICP community might be willing to follow.  These have been the minimum requirements for CodeGov since inception and they are essentially the same requirements laid out in this new grant program.  These tasks can be very interesting work, but it can also be very mundane and inconvenient.  It is not volunteer work.  People who have the skill set to perform this work and willingness to perform this work might require a higher funding level than what is offered, especially if they plan to form teams.  It will be interesting to see who expresses an interest.  I personally have no intention of performing the work of organizing a review team for free or asking any current CodeGov team member to accept a substantially lower bounty payment that is not competitive with other opportunities that they could find.  I want the bounties that are offered to always be a meaningful incentive for their commitment.  In the ideal scenario, these bounties would attract many technical people to perform this work among many teams.  It doesn’t seem like that is what is being offered at this time, but hopefully I am wrong and we end up with many credible options.

If CodeGov doesn’t end up applying for one of these grants, the CodeGov known neuron will still be managed to follow people who develop credibility and are actively participating in reviews of these proposals.  The default position will be to follow known neurons other than DFINITY to help advance decentralization of the NNS on technical topics, but only if that results in 100% voting participation and only if those votes are typically cast before DFINITY votes on these proposals.  Perhaps in 6 months when the funding mechanism switches to the NNS instead of DFINITY developer grants, and especially if funding is related to voting power that is triggered by the votes of known neurons, then maybe it would make more sense to rebuild a CodeGov organization that is focused on technical proposal reviews.  In the meantime, the CodeGov project will advocate for the community of developers who find it worthwhile to step up to perform this work to help decentralize the internet computer at the protocol level.

Hi Lara,

Thanks for putting this effort, it's indeed a very hard and complex topic as you are starting to enter into management and politics. 

We (codegov) had our regular bi-weekly call and it was clear that there wasn't even a rough consensus on the current design.

For the reasons already mentioned by Wenzel, Nathan and I on separate replies, my first strong recommendation is that we halt the application deadline (19th of July) and allow for at least rough consensus to be reached.

I am worried that rushing this design will be unnecessarily sub optimal and the quality of the reviews hurt.

Recomendation 1:
- Application process is halted for allowing more time for a better discussion of the proposed process / design.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-07-06 20:29:51 UTC | #9

Will try to separate recommendations so we can have focused discussion:
- are concerns probable and relevant?
- is the recommendation the best that mitigates it?

I, Wenzel, Nathan, Zane and a few others on the CodeGov team voiced their concern about the **change from a cooperative model to a competitive model** 😞

Concern 1 - Shared Training & Tooling:
We are concerned that peer training, documentation (like review primers) and open source tools (like the review website, notification, tally bot, etc.) will cease to exist in this competitive model.

In a nutshell, we completely lose the economies of scale in shared services / needs.

Concern 2 - Unfair / Innefective Competition:
Furthermore, it seems we are heading towards a "bigger the Voting Power, bigger the reward" kind of mechanism. 

We worry that reviewers will be judged by popularity / marketing effort / collusion with power, than by their technical quality.

Reviewers should be competing by nr of missed reviews, by nr of issues found or by 
Dfinity devs satisfaction (NPS) score, not by individual/subteam popularity.

On another note, the reviewers also don't want to do communication kind of tasks, they rather prefer to delegate into a marketing / project manager that can efficiently run those tasks.

Recommendation 2:
I believe these concerns can be mitigated by having a "core team" that is responsible for all the "shared" services and needs of all reviewers. The way to implement it can be deeper discussed but think of just another grant (same process of applying and being selected or maybe the reviewers can elect this core/supporting team).

The responsibilities of this core team are:
- facilitate periodic calls between all reviewers. 
- With the reviewers define which benchmarks they agree to be tracked and compared about.
- by the end of each month, release the latest results (that should be facts that a third party / anyone else could audit).
- communicate frequently in all relevant channels, with Dfinity and NNS token holders, a summary of results and most important issues found and if they were considered addressed.
- gather reviewers needs, transform into initiatives or requests of dev grants to develop shared tooling / best practices / colaboration opportunities.
- ensure and look after the reviewers well being, that the conditions are attractive and that potential new reviewers have equal chances of being trialed out and onboarded.

With this "core team" concept, think we are able to mitigate all concerns without adding significant new risks. Of course there is cost, but we should see it more as an investment, an investment on consistency, quality and sustainability of the whole system. This "axis" allows for economies of scale on the shared services, the qualified supervising of the reviewers and impartial communication with Dfinity and NNS token holders.

Looking forward to feedback on this recommendation, it's by far the most important I have.

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-07-07 08:50:10 UTC | #11

It would be a lot for one person but not for a full team. It's a lot of work to do these reviews thoroughly and it certainly benefits from having reviewers who are doing development work or something similar at a professional level.

Hi everyone,

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the grant program and for all the information provided. I appreciate the engagement from the community and DFINITY.

I wanted to update everyone on my current situation. At the moment, I am traveling back to my country to meet in person with a few potential team members. We are in the process of forming a dedicated team of 2-3 full-time ICP developers.

Our aim is to offer the creation of decentralized solutions for various ideas and businesses at affordable prices and within fast time-frames. We believe that this approach will help foster innovation and provide valuable services to the ICP community.

The grant would significantly help our team to engage more deeply with the ICP ecosystem by providing us with the resources to focus on governance participation and understanding the latest API changes and protocol developments. This will ensure that our solutions are robust, up-to-date, and aligned with the community’s needs.

Once we have established the team, we will be able to discuss this opportunity further and consider how we can contribute to the NNS governance process effectively.

Your team seems like an ideal fit for this new grant opportunity @b3hr4d.  I have been very impressed with your showcase presentations for the [B3Forge (Candid UI) project](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-b3forge-candid-ui-seamlessly-integrate-and-customize-your-dapp-interfaces/30821?u=wpb) and for the [@ic-reactor (React Library) project](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introduction-ic-reactor-react-for-react-developers/27930?u=wpb).  Both have been well received and provide useful tooling for developers.  

I love the idea that grants to participate in NNS technical proposal reviews are used for supplemental income for teams that are building full time on the internet computer.  I'm very excited to see that you are interested in this grant program and hope that there are 10 more teams like yours that express an interest for each of the proposed topics.  Then perhaps the community would have a strong reason to ask DFINITY to reconsider the scale of this new grant program.  

We need a lot of qualified teams like yours that are willing to step up to perform these reviews in order to help decentralize the NNS on technical topics.  They should be well funded in my opinion.  Teams of 2-3 developers make a lot of sense for the grant sizes that are offered.  I look forward to learning more about your application.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-07-07 14:05:59 UTC | #14

Hi Lara,

Thanks for this announcement. I'm excited to see how this pans out, but I also echo the concerns already raised on this topic. I'm interested to see who is prepared to step up to the challenge of reviewing IC-OS and Protocol Canister Management proposals under this new level of funding (an hourly rate that is less than one that I would find motivating, given time and freedom sacrifices that are incurred - others may have a different threshold). That being said, it's great that DFINITY is willing to put funds towards governance decentralisation.

There are a few points that I think would be useful to clarify for anyone interested in applying for these grants. The announcement mentions:

> Candidates can apply in this forum thread if they **consider themselves as experts** for a particular proposal topic

but it also mentions:

> This intermediate short-term solution has the following advantages... **become** experts for a proposal topic

These two statements seem to be in conflict. Is DFINITY asking for teams only that already consider themselves experts at reviewing a specific type of proposal, or also teams that are hoping to become experts through the process of being funded to take part in reviews?

---

Aside from IC-OS and the other proposal topics, I'm interested to see the introduction of a grant for reviewing Subnet management proposals. Subnet management (and IC OS version **deployment**) is something that I find particularly interesting (evidenced in various comments I've left on IC-OS release threads in recent months):

<details>
	<summary>e.g.</summary>

- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-07-03-23-01/32725/3

- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-05-22-23-01/31096/4
- etc.

</details>

That being said - I wouldn't call myself an expert, at least not yet (also, I'm aware that IC OS Version Deployments are no longer strictly considered part of the System management topic, they were separated out into their own topic a while back).

There are 7 different types of Subnet management proposals that have been executed this year, and numerous other types of Subnet management proposal that have been executed historically. I've pulled proposal history from the API and gathered some stats. The average length of time that the majority of these proposals were open for in 2024 is roughly 2.5 days (there are also exceptional circumstances where they're only open for a few minutes e.g. subnet recovery). There are also occasions where the frequency of these proposals spikes significantly (e.g. 38 subnet config updates in March vs 1 in May - granted, these were simple changes, but it still indicates the potential for significant variability in workload). Given this, would you be able to clarify the following:
 - What timeframe is a reviewer of Subnet management proposals expected/required to cast a vote within? (note that these proposals can appear without warning on any day of the week)
 - Given that the level of work required to review these proposals can vary, are there any provisions for upping the funding during busy periods? (and what if a reviewer cannot keep up with a period of exceptionally high demand?)
 - In the event that a proposal may seem to require rejection, what channel should a reviewer use to voice their concerns. Will there be a dedicated forum topic, as there is for IC-OS releases?
 - What happens after the 6 months are up (would a reviewer reapply, or is the idea that other candidates would be given priority?)

Hi @wpb,

Thank you so much for your kind words and support! It means a lot to hear positive feedback about our projects, B3Forge and ic-reactor. We are passionate about creating useful tools for developers and contributing to the ICP ecosystem.

I completely agree that grants for participating in NNS technical proposal reviews can be a great supplemental income for teams like ours, allowing us to focus on building full-time on the Internet Computer. We are excited about this grant program and its potential to support dedicated teams in their efforts to help decentralize the NNS.

We are in the final stages of forming our team, and we will definitely consider applying for this grant once we are fully set up. I appreciate your encouragement and look forward to collaborating with other passionate teams in this space.

I hate to do a drive-by post, but I've expressed this opinion more than a few times, so I'll repeat my 2 cents here.

I'm certainly not against grants as a short-term solution, but I think it is a bad precedent to set and not a long-term solution.

Reasoning:

1. As soon as people are paid for voting they have a bias and reason to add rigidity to the system.(see almost any legislative body, but especially the US houses).
2. The incentive to vote should come from the value of the vote. If the vote has no real value, that is why no voting community has started voting for it and no one will unless paid to do so until it has actual value.

How do you artificially put a value on the vote?  Slashing.

The people allowing the results of these votes to be installed on their machines, who get paid the rewards for providing the network infrastructure should be the ones validating these proposals.

Inject purposely wrong Protocol Canister Code, ICOS Versions, Subnet configs, Participant management, and node admin items and slash Nodes if approved.  Or slash NNS Neurons if they approve fraudulent proposals.  Those with large stakes or expecting large network rewards will rapidly bootstrap the infrastructure needed to verify and validate proposals and the infrastructure to reach out and collect followers without the need to pay people directly for voting.

Slash their node reward. Slash our NNS rewards. Build a Moloch Chaos Monkey and force organization and infrastructure creation.

I like the idea of giving grants to voting neurons to get more people involved in NNS governance. It’s great that this could help decentralize things and motivate folks to participate. Having specialized and redundant voting can really boost the decision-making process.

But I'm worried about centralization. If most people delegate their votes to the big neurons to earn more rewards, it could lead to a concentration of power, which isn't good for diversity in governance. This goes against the decentralization we’re aiming for.

Also, the funding seems too low for larger groups, which might stop them from getting involved effectively.

In short, while the proposal has its good points, these concerns need to be addressed to keep the governance fair and decentralized.

This is correct, it should only cover the canister upgrades that will be in the new topic Protocol Canister Management.
Of course some of the other canister are also very important, but we thought it makes sense to start with a few topics.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-08 11:23:08 UTC | #19

Thanks for the suggestion. IMH we don't need to halt this altogether, as incoming applications might also add to the discussion (whether there is even interest and where the current proposal is maybe not the best fit). 
If we need to further discuss and clarify things, I would propose to just increase the deadline if we feel like we need more time. 

Let me bring this up internally and get back to you.

Thanks for the feedback.

> Furthermore, it seems we are heading towards a “bigger the Voting Power, bigger the reward” kind of mechanism.

I don’t quite understand how this would be the case or increased with having grants for multiple neurons that are decided by the community. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on why you think this is the case?
By voting on who will get these grants, couldn’t we as a community decide what we think are good known neurons independently of the voting power they already have? We could for example favour many smaller projects with less voting power or groups which we think would establish a good voting culture independent of their voting power.

I think the part about shared tools and regular exchanges is a good point! I wonder though whether this requires a certain format like one one dedicated group to arrange this for everyone or whether other formats, e.g., where multiple people contribute different things, are also conceivable. It will be interesting to see how this evolves over time!

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-08 17:43:03 UTC | #27

>These two statements seem to be in conflict. Is DFINITY asking for teams only that already consider themselves experts at reviewing a specific type of proposal, or also teams that are hoping to become experts through the process of being funded to take part in reviews?

Thanks for pointing that out! In the end the community will be voting on who gets the funds, so it is about convincing the wider community that someone is "up for the job". 

In my personal opinion, I think it is good if a candidate has the required background knowledge to at least interpret the proposals on a high level from the first week on. But they could then become more and more experts on the details of the topic and maybe be able to go deeper with time.
For example, if someone would apply for verifying upgrades, the community might want to know that this person can read Rust code and knows the IC's basic architecture. For canister upgrades, the community might prefer to vote for people who can show that they already built or reviewed canister code before. But it might be acceptable that there is still some learning required wrt the details of the particular components or with the details of how to set up the voting neuron etc.

If in doubt, and given the information you already shard, I would encourage you to try to apply. If you are just honest about what you already know and what you still plan to learn during the process, the worst thing that can happen is that the community things the expertise is not yet enough. 


> What timeframe is a reviewer of Subnet management proposals expected/required to cast a vote within? (note that these proposals can appear without warning on any day of the week)

I think it would be fine to vote within the normal 4 days that the proposal is open for. Even if it is adopted early, casting a vote in the normal time would still get the neuron and its followers the rewards. 
For normal (non-emergency) cases, it can maybe also be considered whether the irregular proposals can be submitted with more "warning", e.g, always on a the same day or with a heads-up on some form thread etc. I think finding out what works best here can be one of the wins of this initiative.

> Given that the level of work required to review these proposals can vary, are there any provisions for upping the funding during busy periods? (and what if a reviewer cannot keep up with a period of exceptionally high demand?)

The idea was to account for that by averaging the work hours over the weeks. It was estimated that in many typical weeks the required work would be a lot less than 2h, but as you correctly say sometimes it would go up. We tried to account for that and the overhead of just watching hte proposal action by rounding up the estimated time. We are also aware that these are just estimates

> In the event that a proposal may seem to require rejection, what channel should a reviewer use to voice their concerns. Will there be a dedicated forum topic, as there is for IC-OS releases?

The idea would be to post all the verification steps on the forum. We will have to decide if it makes more sense to have a forum thread for each voting neuron or for all of them. I would then propose that concerns should be raised there.

>Will there be a dedicated forum topic, as there is for IC-OS releases?

I don't think we have decided what works best, but I like the idea! We can maybe think about what works best for the topics but also of an easy way that all the verifications of the different topics can found in a similar way!

> What happens after the 6 months are up (would a reviewer reapply, or is the idea that other candidates would be given priority?)

The idea is that roughly at this point the longer-term feature, where an incentive system would be built into the system, would be implemented. So neurons that continue to be interested to be voting neurons that can be followed would be encouraged to "switch" to this system (as the design is unclear it remains to be seen what this means in detail). 

I hope this answers most of your questions, otherwise please feel free to reach out again!

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-08 17:58:42 UTC | #29

Thanks for the input.
We agree with this too. As mentioned in the original forum post, this is meant to be the short-term solution to already kick this off and profit from the first learnings for the different involved parties.

We will of course share design ideas for the long-term solution(s) once we have them and I propose that we then discuss the pros and cons of the different options there in more detail.

This is a valid concern. For the longer-term solution we can take this into account: for example, if the rewards would depend on how many neurons follow a voting neuron, we could cap that at a certain % - in that way the voting neuron would be incentivised to get some followers but also not be incentivised to get more than a certain % of followers. 
I think in the current state, if there are some (up to 8) new neurons that can be followed, this would likely lead to *more* decentralization. Therefore, I propose that in the short-term solution we focus on engaging more neurons and then we consider these concerns for the longer-term solution.

-------------------------

Zane | 2024-07-08 18:05:31 UTC | #32

I share the same considerations already expressed by CodeGov team members. On top of the points they've already raised I'm also concerned the proposed interim solution might work against what DFINITY is planning for the future, I say this based on the assumption the long term solution will be based on VP, since past discussion have hinted at it.
If in any shape or form the funding model in 6 months for such activities will be based on this principle, I believe teams are best suited to function in that kind of environment, mainly for two reasons: they are less likely to miss votes, which entices following and its more likely they can gather enough VP to sustain operations.

The problem is that the current system doesn't account very well for teams, in fact it promotes fragmentation. 
A group of 5 is incentivized to split and apply for as many grants as possible to both maximize funding and their likelihood to be chosen at all. Big teams are also completely left out of the equation.
This would result in possibly duplicating the administrative burden and surely fragmenting VP, which means once we transition to a NNS based funding model, they are less likely to have attracted enough to sustain themselves.

CodeGov is a clear example of this taking place. For the past year we have been building a public image and increasingly received the trust of stackers. With the proposed changes all the momentum will come to a halt, instead of accelerating and eventually allowing a smooth transition to the new system.

The election mechanism is also not entirely flawless, as either DFINITY will act as a filter, essentially rendering it just a grant with extra steps or the community chooses based on popularity rather than merit. 

Imho a more sensible approach would have been to:
1) Maximize interest and participation in reviewing protocol upgrades by publicly announcing grants for it, perhaps during ICP RnDs, as I think many don't know it was something they could receive a grant for.
2) Actively monitor the active groups and promote them to the community by explaining what they do and why it's important, increasing the likelihood that enough VP is shifted to their neurons.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-08 18:24:05 UTC | #33

Thanks for all the reactions, applications, and feedback so far!

One of the main concerns and open questions is how this grant program can fit the larger verifying group codegov and how codegov members should apply.
I want to reassure everyone that we read all the comments and heard this feedback. 

We propose to keep this forum discussion and application process open to gather more information who else applies for the grants and then discuss early next week if and how we need to reassess the details of the proposal. Several team members are also out this week and would be back by then. 

Maybe codegov members could hold with applying for next week when we have this additional information? We can then also increase the overall deadline to accommodate for that if needed!

I wish everyone a great day!

[/quote]

Do you mind sharing your thoughts on a permanent solution?  These grants are a bootstrap for sure, not a permanent solution.  DFINITY shouldn’t be handing out these kinds of grants indefinitely for a variety of reasons.  So how should it be funded?  

@skilesare offered his opinion that it should be a penalty instead of a reward, which is a fair perspective.  I would think node providers need an increase in payment if they are suddenly going to be saddled with the responsibility of securing the network or face slashing.  After all, they would need to hire resources to review all the technical proposals.  I guess that would be up for debate as well.  

I prefer the reward approach instead of the penalty approach.  

Current tokenomics and current node provider rewards do not incentivize people and organizations to review technical proposals and offer an assessment of the health of implementation of those proposals independent of DFINITY.  So if we think decentralization is important, and especially if we want to reset default following with periodic confirmation of Followees and have other options besides just DFINITY to follow, then what should be the long term solution to fund this work?  What is the most logical source of funding?

I would highly recommend that DFINITY creates a new post for every proposal and that the post is tagged with the proposal topic.  The title of the post should include the proposal number (not just the replica version or canister ID).  It is often very challenging to find forum topic that are associated with a particular proposal.  The format used by the IC-OS Version Election proposal team is the most consistent and reviewer friendly in my opinion, but it could still be improved.  Every reviewer could then post their review results in that post.  

DFINITY should also consider giving reviewers permission to automate their posts to these threads.  For example, the build / hash verification can be automated with proof of results posted automatically.  When we were talking about the GaaS App (Governance as a Service) that CodeGov is working on, we wanted to produce a summary that could automatically be posted to OpenChat, Taggr, Telegram, and the forum, but we hit a road block on posting to the forum due to current restrictions. Allowing this feature could make the reviewers task much more user friendly.

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-07-08 19:19:32 UTC | #36

If we move forward with this initiative, I would apply for Protocol Canister Management.

Also, we should probably have a forum post for each proposal for everyone to share findings and discuss changes with the team that is proposing the change.
@wpb was faster with my suggestion :)

Thanks Lara, I plan to apply for Subnet management. I'll put together an application.

I may also apply for Participant management & Node Admin. My understanding is that 'Update unassigned nodes to latest replica' is no longer a proposal that falls under the Node Admin topic. This came up in one of my [HostOS reviews recently](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-05-22-23-01/31096/5?u=lorimer).

Would you be able to clarify this point in the announcement above (are certain IC OS Version Deployment proposals intended to fall under the scope of this grant or does the annoucement need amending, or have I misunderstood)?

dfisher | 2024-07-09 10:31:24 UTC | #40

Hi @lara,

Thank you for putting together this proposal as it is a step in the right direction. I would like to take a step back and revisit what we are trying to achieve in order to shine light on another issue.

To clearly state the goal, we would like to decentralize voting power away from Dfinity and empower individual neurons from within the community. 

In order to achieve this goal, 

1. Named neurons to be incentivized to do valuable work and gain a following
2. The IC community needs a reason to vote for named neurons other than Dfinity

Your proposal addresses point 1) above, and is a step in the right direction. If named neurons are paid, then they will be incentivized to work. That said, today, there is absolutely no reason the IC community has an incentive to vote for named neurons, EVEN IF they are doing excellent work. 

I cannot overstate how big of a weakness this point is to the current design, and would like to provide an example to illustrate my point. Recently, I was debating whether to change my follow relationships for a couple of the IC topics so I could empower CodeGov. I have long admired all the work they do, especially since I know Wenzel personally, and can vouch that he is extremely reliable and devoted. I also wanted to do my small part to decentralize the IC and follow Code Gov rather than Dfinity. 

All that said, I had an upside / downside equation to make. My choice was as follows:

1. Follow Dfinity 

Upside: Reliably get 100% of my rewards
Downside: The IC stays that little bit more centralized

2. Follow CodeGov

Upside: The IC gets a little bit more decentralized 
Downside: CodeGov slacks and misses a vote given its not any of their day jobs, and I miss out on my rewards

Given this upside / downside equation, I had very little incentive to follow CodeGov. As much as I want to see the IC become decentralized, it simply isn't worth the risk on missing out on rewards. 

Again, I cannot overstate how big of a problem this is to the goal of getting people to follow other neurons that are not Dfinity. We need to design a system that incentivizes folks to follow other people, where they are paid for the risk. To be honest, I am a bit surprised that this dynamic hasn't yet been raised by the community as it seems to be very basic. 

@lara I'd be curious to hear your feedback on my thoughts. While it doesn't directly address point 1) of this topic which is the focus on this thread, I sincerely believe that point 2) is a fundamental weakness and serious time and energy needs to be spend on fixing that issue.

[/quote]

Thank you so much for clearly outlining both elements of this problem @dfisher .  I agree point 2 is equally important to point 1.  At the end of the day, there is no real reason to follow anyone other than DFINITY on technical topics even if there are known neurons that are capable and committed to offering a decentralized option.  Your experience is a clear example of this point.  Thank you for sharing it.

The only other example we have of trying to decentralize the NNS away from the original default following of DFINITY/ICA is the Governance proposal topic (SNS & Neuron’s Fund didn’t exist at the time and the default following when it was created followed the Governance topic, which was already decentralized).  Even though the solution on that proposal topic didn’t incentivize the new known neurons via rewards, the solution to that problem did address point 2.  

At the time, DFINITY was not voting reliably on the Governance topic.  Hence, if you wanted to maximize rewards you had to follow either Synapse, cycledao, or ICDevs.  Unfortunately, ICDevs was a little late specifically because the NNS was not decentralized and a very large genesis neuron other than DFINITY had enough voting power to block their first two attempts at becoming a known neuron…that is until Synapse and cycledao grew a following and other genesis neurons started to realize they were losing voting rewards.  

The change that occurred was that the Governance topic was removed from the All Topics catch all and required explicit following on the Governance topic or you lost rewards.  Since DFINITY wasn’t voting on the Governance topic, you had to choose one of the new known neurons or vote manually in order to get your rewards.  The change to following patterns happened almost immediately due to the impact on voting rewards.

I’m not suggesting that this needs to be a solution to point number 2 on these technical topics.  The point is just that decentralization probably requires that there is a reason to follow someone else besides DFINITY.  This new grant program doesn’t address that issue like @dfisher indicated.  Hopefully the long term solution that is rolled out in 6 months will include a solution to this problem.  In the meantime, this grant program should offer an opportunity for known neuron to gain credibility as a Followee for these technical topics.

Seers | 2024-07-09 17:27:10 UTC | #44

I believe the solution lies in this direction detailed by @skilesare. It appears that we consistently face issues with improper incentivization on the IC. Despite having voting rewards, which have proven insufficient, we now have grants. What's the next step? A larger grant?

-------------------------

god | 2024-07-10 16:43:29 UTC | #45

@lara 

1) I am very interested but the compensation is quite low. The workload can vary and the compensation needs to reflect that. 

2) Also, can the engineering team provide some example reports for each task so we can understand the standard of work you require. This would really help us gauge the total workload. 

3) Also some statistics of expected proposals per month would be helpful.

4) Does applying as an individual hurt one's chances for selection? It is confusing on how much manpower you expect for the amount you are willing to pay. 

Please provide clarity.

Jesse | 2024-07-10 17:49:22 UTC | #46

Hey @lara and ICP community members. 

I would like to be considered for the **Protocol Canister Management** grant, the **Participant Management & Node Admin** grant, and the **Subnet management** grant. I've engaged with many of you within the ICP community over the years, but for those of you whom I've yet to meet: 

**My name is *Jesse D. Williams Jr.***

I'm an ICP developer building [Personal DAO](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/personal-dao-a-commoditized-dao-that-functions-as-a-icp-neuron-pool-for-now-more-features-on-the-way/29958?u=jesse) which, in short, is a commoditized application that functions as a turn key DAO that communities can use to pool their neuron stakes, lend to earn interest, leverage their neuron stakes to borrow liquid ICP, fund community initiatives and more. 

My X account can be found here: https://x.com/JesseThaGreat_
The Personal DAO X account can be found here: https://x.com/Personal_DAO

My LinkdIn account can be found here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-williams-m-s-8369601ab

**My team consists of 2 developers** (myself and [Samuel Atwebembeire](https://x.com/samthetutor2))

My **relevant experience** consists of:

* 10+ years of quantitative reasoning background that includes combinatorics, optimization of algorithms for space and time complexity and teaching/training students of computer science
* 5+ years of industry experience as a software engineer
* 3+ years of experience developing on the Internet Computer
* 3+ years participating in NNS governance as an active voter on the Internet Computer
* 5+ years of rigorous independent study within the field of economics, economic history, monetary policy and capital markets

**Relevant Technical Knowledge** includes:

* Familiarity with NNS architecture and functionality
* Familiarity with the DFX SDK for building, verifying and deploying ICP canisters
* Proficiency with Motoko, Rust, Typescript and Javascript development
* Proficiency with Optimization of algorithmic functions with respect to space and time complexity

For those of you who would like to see a reference to my work, the best showcase would be the [Personal DAO Decentralized Web Application](https://unl3b-waaaa-aaaam-ach6a-cai.icp0.io/)

note: *(The github repo to this project is still private pending a code audit. The link above takes you to the live instance of the first Personal DAO deployed to the internet computer. To access it, click the *login* button and then authenticate your internet identity. Doing so automatically submits a request for access to the DAO. Once you've done so, reach out to me with your principal ID and I will approve you for access to the DAO. From there, you'll be able to participate as any other DAO member.)*

My **motivation for becoming a voting neuron** is that I've invested several years of time and resources developing a digital business on top of the internet computer protocol as well as a positive working relationship with the community. I have every interest in seeing to it that the IC is properly governed so that I may continue to carry out my mission of onboarding participants of the TradFi economy to the DeFi space. 

My **reason for needing grant funding** is that I work full time towards contributing to the internet computer ecosystem as a builder, which limits the time that I have available for pursuing other sources of income. In order to continue to contribute to this ecosystem and sustain myself, it will require some form of basic funding that allows me to meet my financial obligations in the real world. 

I am **acting in the long-term interest of the ICP ecosystem** because this is the ecosystem that I've chosen to host the technical foundation of my web3 business (Personal DAO). I benefit in no way, shape or form from voting in a way that is counterproductive to the Internet Computer's security, operations, and/or community. To do so would render my own efforts and resources over the past several years unfruitful.

I am **interested in the topics for which I am applying** because I understand the implications that these topics have for the development and security of the ICP ecosystem. Additionally, these are the topics that I feel confident voting on as I believe I have the technical background and experience needed in order to make an informed decision on these topics. 

**I will remain a voting neuron in the long term, even after the grant program has ended** because, as the founder and lead developer of an ICP project, I have a vested interest in helping ensure that the network's security and integrity is maintained for the sake of the business that I operate. Furthermore, Personal DAO requires that the DAO's neurons select a delegate for their vote, I will be the default delegate for all Personal DAOs deployed to the Internet Computer. This means that in order to service my own community of supporters, I am required to maintain an active role as a voting neuron- independently of this grant. 

My **voting principles** derive from a commitment to decentralization and sovereignty for users and builders- no introduction of any centralized points of failure that could be manipulated to the detriment of end-users. My conviction for this principle is demonstrated by the architecture that I've chosen for Personal DAO in which no entity outside of each respective Personal DAO (not even myself as the developer) may interfere with the DAO's canister's WASM modules nor their internal governance.

Trils | 2024-07-11 12:42:06 UTC | #47

Is there some grants foreseen for just normal users trying to vote manually and trying to understand what the proposal is about?

Like some airdrop system to incentivize people to vote manually that are not tech savy... I rather see the grants/money be spend on the community and new people getting airdrops by actively participating in the voting without having a PHD in cyrptography.

From there you can then extend the airdrops for extra sidemissions on a proposal, could be even in the form of a quiz about the proposal. :slight_smile:

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-11 13:36:06 UTC | #48

Thanks for these ideas.
Originally my concern was that if there is a new post for each proposal it might be harder to find them. But indeed, maybe we could have guidelines for naming and e.g., have a new topic or so so that these posts are easy to find. 


> we hit a road block on posting to the forum due to current restrictions

do you know what is blocking this exactly alread? I assume that this is some sort of bot protection? I am happy to look more into whether this would be easy to change.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-11 13:38:52 UTC | #49

Thanks, that a very good catch! 

Indeed, I confirmed that the type “update unassigned nodes to latest replica” is now under the topic "IC OS deployment" and would not be part of the topic "Participant management & Node Admin". I will try to edit my original post to reflect this.

Thanks for raising this concern @dfisher and @wpb.

I think it is also interesting to consider how this could be achieved without *additional* incentives. For example, as @wpb mentioned, it might have an effect if some larger neurons just sit out a few proposals (e.g., if they anyways have a clear outcome). Or indeed it could be an outcome that it is better to have a larger team behind a known neuron. Or different smaller known neurons could span together and e.g., vote most of the time but follow the other known neuron's vote in case where they missed a proposal.. I am not saying that any of these are necessarily the best solution, these are just a few ideas to illustrate that it could be interesting to also think about processes etc and not only features to address certain problems. 

In any case, I agree that this is an interesting problem to consider, but also think it does not take away the value from this initiative. I agree that this could be discussed in the context of the longer-term solution or as a follow up to the priodic rest of following - which is more targeted at this "side" - e.g., at motivating voters to change their following rather than at motivating voting neurons.

Hi, 

> I am very interested but the compensation is quite low. The workload can vary and the compensation needs to reflect that.

I think this is already reflected to some extent - the estimates that we got from engineering teams were rounded up. It is also deliberately kept a bit open how many commits should be reviewed in depth to account for the fact that it is not possible to go into the same depths every week.

> Also, can the engineering team provide some example reports for each task so we can understand the standard of work you require. This would really help us gauge the total workload.

We don't currently have such an example. Maybe as a first step it could help if you look at an example by CodeGov to have a better feeling for the effort? I think what is shared in detail is also something that might evolve. But I expect that the larger effort will be to actually read and interpret the proposal - maybe to undersand this better you could look at a few concrete proposals from the topic that you are interested in? 

> Also some statistics of expected proposals per month would be helpful.

I think a good estimate for this is to look at the number of past proposals. To do so, you can e.g., go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) and filter the proposals for a certain topic and average over the last few months and years. We also did so for the estimates. I don't have the exact numbers handy anymore, but I think it roughly the average proposal per week was: 

* Protocol canister management: ~2.2
* IC OS election: ~2
* Participant management & Node Admin: ~5
* Subnet management: ~4 

> Does applying as an individual hurt one’s chances for selection? It is confusing on how much manpower you expect for the amount you are willing to pay.

As mentioned by others, maybe a group of people will have an easier time to ensure no proposals are missed. Other than that I can't think of a reason why one person would have a disadvantage, but in the end this will be up to the voters.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-11 14:59:49 UTC | #53

Thanks I think this is another thing we can think about, but might address another goal. 

Note that for some of the topics you don't need a PhD in cryptography. For example I think the topics "Participant Management & Node Admin" can be learned with less technical knowledge.

Hey @NathanosDev would you mind explaining the issue as you discovered from discussions with DFINITY?  Why did we decide we can’t automate submitting our final summary report to the forum through the GaaS App?  Was it restrictions on automated posts?

[/quote]

I’ll throw out another idea of a process that you could consider @lara ...

DFINITY controls the ICA neurons, but ICA was originally intended to be an independent organization and it has significant voting power through 40+ neurons.  You could take the total voting power of ICA and divide it equally among all the known neurons that are selected by the NNS to participate in this grant program.  

Whoever actually controls the ICA neurons could configure those neurons to follow each elected known neuron on the specific topics where they are elected.  This would give these elected known neurons a meaningful voting power that is cast when they vote as soon as the program starts.  As time passes, if the elected known neurons change, then the following can also be changed for these ICA neurons.  In other words, this change in following doesn’t have to be permanent.

DFINITY could commit to not voting on the specific proposal topics that are included in this grant program.  After all, DFINITY is the sole contributor to the changes that are implemented under those proposal topics.  Wouldn’t it be nice if the adoption of those proposals were largely influenced by known neurons other than DFINITY?  This would drive changes in follow patterns, especially among people who only care about voting rewards.

If DFINITY depends on voting rewards from these proposal topics, then they could always vote for most of the proposals with DFINITY owned voting power (not the ICA neuron) according to the votes cast by the elected known neurons.  Not voting on a small fraction of these proposals is probably enough to drive changes.

DFINITY can still vote if they find a sudden need to reject a proposal after it was submitted.  To my knowledge, there is no need to rush a rejection since nothing changes.

Since DFINITY still controls the ICA neurons, they can even trigger a manual vote on these neurons if it is a critical proposal.  I would think that can address any security concerns associated with needing an absolute majority on critical proposals.

The ICA neuron maturity could also be used to fund this grant program (assuming DFINITY or ICA isn’t using it for other purposes already).  There is probably considerable maturity associated with ICA neurons that could substantially improve the incentives for this grant program.

The ICA neurons could play a central role in helping advance decentralization of the NNS on technical topics since they were originally conceived for this type of decentralized purpose anyway.  It’s not a perfect process, but it seems to get us much closer to decentralization.  It’s also 100% process related that doesn’t depend on any code changes.  Hence, it could be implemented immediately.  It also seems like a reasonable baby step on the path to full decentralization over a long time period.

Hi all, I am applying for the **protocol canister management** category.

For those who don't know me I'm [Léo, ex-DFINITY](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-kaz/). I worked for DFINITY for about 2 years as a software engineer. I contributed to various projects such as ckBTC, ckETH, and ckERC20. You can check out all my commits [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commits/master/?author=leokazz). I submitted about [35 canisters-related proposals](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/70) and reviewed even more.

I am also a contributor to [WaterNeuron](https://x.com/WaterNeuron), which aligns with this initiative of having more external contributions to governance. Hence I will vote with what I think is best for the long-term interest of ICP. Feel free to send me a message on the forum or on [X](https://x.com/leokazzz) if you have any questions.

Ideally, you want to use the voting rewards directly to incentivize this behavior. Here, we're acknowledging that voting rewards are a bit useless and redirecting some to the grants. Taking into account that we're printing about half a billion dollars in rewards per year, we probably want to make them useful.

[/quote]

That's exactly what the long-term solution is likely to look like (as I understand it). These grants are just a short-term interim solution to get the ball rolling and encourage some new faces and competition into the mix (as exemplar followees). I think this is explained in the announcement.

> Taking into account that we’re printing about half a billion dollars in rewards per year, we probably want to make them useful.

I think your right to point out the privilege and responsibility that followees hold. There are certainly cases where they should be held to a higher standard - I hope this will happen over time. But first we need more skilled people to get involved, and we need to incentivise people to follow neurons that can evidence that they do a better job than other neurons. On a related note, you may find this week's IC-OS proposal interesting in this respect ->

[quote="Lorimer, post:5, topic:33072"]
Given that the commit hasn’t been available externally until now, it’s concerning how popular the ‘yes’ vote has been so far (how did they verify the build?!) :scream:

I think @skilesare is onto something with his suggestions. I think ultimately we're going to need consequences for irresponsible voters (but then we'd need a way of bating/detecting irresponsible voters, and this would come with a whole load of implications - but I still think it's going to be needed in some shape or form). Competition is pointless without a selection pressure.

How do you artificially put a value on the vote? Slashing.

The people allowing the results of these votes to be installed on their machines, who get paid the rewards for providing the network infrastructure should be the ones validating these proposals.

Inject purposely wrong Protocol Canister Code, ICOS Versions, Subnet configs, Participant management, and node admin items and slash Nodes if approved. Or slash NNS Neurons if they approve fraudulent proposals. Those with large stakes or expecting large network rewards will rapidly bootstrap the infrastructure needed to verify and validate proposals and the infrastructure to reach out and collect followers without the need to pay people directly for voting.

Slash their node reward. Slash our NNS rewards. Build a Moloch Chaos Monkey and force organization and infrastructure creation.

Hi Austin,

This is going into the "should we motivate with a carrot or with a whip"?

I always tend towards the "carrot" alternatives, the "whip" options frequently have unexpected effects, especially under a context where the "demander" actually has little power over the "subjects".

Allow me to exemplify, imagine such a system goes live, I am afraid that:
- we will put a responsibility onto Node providers, that they are not prepared to assume. Wouldn't they feel frustrated? How would that affect in terms of some of them leaving or new ones not joining? We are putting a significant stress (because it's not easy for them), without any real power over them. 

- If the motivation is only "avoid being slashed", aren't you afraid that their efforts will stop as soon as that is ensured? They can hire a team whose only purpose is to detect and avoid any "basic flaw", but what about helping the Dev teams with comments / requests for clarifications? What about requesting that all significant changes are in the logs? What if a reviewer sees a potential bug / downtime / security issue?

In the end, the question is, do we (as NNS) want the best possible review service (because they avoid bugs, downtime, security, misalignment) and want to design a system that provides for that, or we just want to prevent bad behaviour. I think your solution was targeting the latter, while I feel the NNS wants the first. 

Do you agree that the problem should not be a responsibility of Node Providers, because it's not under their zone of expertise? so we shouldn't suddenly add / request such a significant responsibility into them, for sure it will go wrong.

Hope these arguments help somehow improve the final design.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-07-14 11:34:33 UTC | #63

Hi @lara ,

Apologies for the delay in replying, only now had a good opportunity to dig deeper into this thread again.

Will try to answer all questions below:

[quote="lara, post:22, topic:32721"]
> Furthermore, it seems we are heading towards a “bigger the Voting Power, bigger the reward” kind of mechanism.

I don’t quite understand how this would be the case or increased with having grants for multiple neurons that are decided by the community. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on why you think this is the case?
By voting on who will get these grants, couldn’t we as a community decide what we think are good known neurons independently of the voting power they already have? We could for example favour many smaller projects with less voting power or groups which we think would establish a good voting culture independent of their voting power.
[/quote]

Our worry is more on the final design, not these grants phase only. If you are already splitting into smaller teams and each having known neurons, we assumed the final design would be for NNS to payout bigger amounts to higher VP known-neurons and smaller payouts to lower VP / individual known-neurons. 

But from your replies am seeing this might be more "equal" payments for "equal" work and try to spread out over as many teams as possible, with maybe a rotation system. We can definitely leave this discussion for a future thread :slightly_smiling_face:

[quote="lara, post:22, topic:32721"]
I think the part about shared tools and regular exchanges is a good point! I wonder though whether this requires a certain format like one one dedicated group to arrange this for everyone or whether other formats, e.g., where multiple people contribute different things, are also conceivable. It will be interesting to see how this evolves over time!
[/quote]

The "core team" / "council" should be small, and be facilitators of the reviewers. Many initiatives can be done by the reviewers themselves, but the finding of funding / requirements, project management, will probably be from the core team.

I am only worried that already on this grants phase we have and are capable of paying for this coordination team, that pays back by generating efficiencies between the reviewers.

Probably the best decision for now is to assign this responsibility to CodeGov / Wenzel and see how it evolves until the final design is ironed out.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-07-14 12:09:04 UTC | #64

Hi @lara ,

So, after reading the discussions so far and thinking things deeper, would suggest the following changes for consideration:

1) Addition of a "Facilitator" Grant, ~1500$-2500$ a month, expecting a team of 2 or 3 part time man-power, responsible for:
   * facilitate bi-weekly calls between all reviewers.
   * with the reviewers define which benchmarks they agree to be tracked and compared about on each type. (that should be facts that a third party / anyone else could audit, like failed votes, etc.)
   * by the end of each month, release the latest results.
   * communicate frequently in all relevant channels, with Dfinity and NNS token holders, a summary of results and most important issues found and if they were considered addressed.
    * gather reviewers needs, transform into initiatives or requests of dev grants to develop shared tooling / best practices / collaboration opportunities.
    * ensure and look after the reviewers well being, that the conditions are attractive and that potential new reviewers have equal chances of being trialed out and onboarded.

2) Increase significantly the amount for IC-OS proposals (~2x-3x) OR already define layers of expertise and increase the number of teams. While the other grants are "attractive", think the IC-OS is completely off / "unattractive". A few reasons / diffs:
   - The learning curve for IC-OS is vastly bigger, has several OS, many layers, it's very complex! Even on CodeGov we have many times desired to split ourselves in "areas of expertise", as it's ineffective to "superficially" review all areas. For reviewers to deliver better work on IC-OS, they should specialise by layers (either through the grants or inside each IC-OS team).
   - IC-OS is the "main" work of Dfinity, meaning the quantity of changes at the end of the week is a lot more than Protocol System Management (PSM). It makes absolute no sense to pay them the same amount, it should be at least 3x higher than PSM.
   - Also the chances for finding a critical bug (or by questioning/commenting on something, helping Dfinity teams to avoid a critical bug) are much higher than on other proposals. Almost all downgraded performance has happened after an IC release (or better, when it was released on a subnet). Avoiding one of these immediately pays back the investment we are making monthly here.

3) Decrease the amount payed to Protocol System Canister reviews to 1500$~2500$ a month. I find the amount of work and expertise needed to be more fair in that range.

And that's all. Looking forward for this week's discussions and eventual final design before code gov applies. Thanks again for this work. :pray:

-------------------------

god | 2024-07-14 17:20:01 UTC | #65

@lara 

1. Don't decrease amounts paid as suggested but increase them. 

For example Participant management & Node Admin there ~18 proposals per month and and offer of $750. Or $41 at 90% voting rate. Some months have less and some have more proposals. 

You cant just consider the total time to complete each task, You also have to consider that this work is being done to support the ecosystem and not as part of someone's full time priority. So yes the work is somewhat easy but to get it done one has to get it done with competing demands for that time. That's why there is an issue of low participation on these topics.  And its not like one can schedule to do the work over the weekends because voting periods end on different days. Let us properly reward the work and those that will commit to it. This isn't Dfinity hiring an employee.

Lets not get carried away by saying work is easy yet very few are actually doing it. 

2. "Facilitator" Grant is basically a supervisor. I dont want to feel like an underpaid employee. Again we are doing this to support the ecosystem. Let us be sensitive.

[/quote]

I'm 100% with you....I almost always prefer carrots to whips. The problem with the current DFINITY stack is that everyone is 100% dependent on DFINITY to produce and bless a replica/system canisters/hardware spec. If we want participation then we need responsibility. If the node providers just want to get rewarded for providing the hardware, I guess that is ok, but they are the next logical piece in the stack because they actually have to run it. It seems to me that they SHOULD be experts in what they are running if they are getting paid to run it. I mean that is mostly a carrot: You're going to get paid for running high-quality replica software that doesn't have bugs.

With ETH2 clients..if you run the wrong software your stake gets slashed...but that is a rarity and most of the time you're getting paid yield on your stake.

The other option is to encourage the building and running of multiple replicas and to pay software teams if their replicas are chosen by the nodes.  Generally, some kind of market forces for the production of quality code that encourages many people to become experts is what we should be going for.

Hi all,

Have been talking internally, and me, as a member of ICP HUB PT (https://icpportugal.com/), would like to inform of our intention in supporting this effort in any way that is needed.

Depending on how many applicants we have for each topic, we can apply to the most needed topic. We expect to apply to either Node Admin or Subnet Management.

We are setting up a decentralized neuron that will follow 3 key staff members that are committed in looking deeper into any topic we assume responsibility over. Then we will also use our social channels to bring awareness to any relevant proposal and why we voted the way we did.

Will wait for more developments in this thread and once an application formalises, will inform here.

Thanks and have a great day :+1:

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-18 11:46:14 UTC | #68

Thanks everyone for their applications, inputs, and questions.

**We edited the original post / proposal slightly as a response to the feedback.**

You can see the difference by using the forum’s function to see the edits, but I will also list the main changes in the following to make sure they are clear.

* The initial proposal was not well-suited for larger groups with multiple reviewers for each proposal. To account for this, **we now added a “team grant”** where such groups can receive a larger grant for a topic. The reason for this is that we agree that it is valuable to have groups that work in this way so the grants should support that.
* There was feedback that **IC OS election proposals** require more work than protocol canister management. To account for this feedback, we increased the grants for the IC OS election to $7500 / month.
* We thank everyone for their patience. To ensure there is enough time for everyone who is interested to apply, we also **extended the application deadline until the end of the month (July 31st).**

We are looking forward to many applications - please feel free to also forward this to others who might be interested!

Have a great rest of the day!

wpb | 2024-07-18 12:20:36 UTC | #69

Thanks @lara.  These are some nice improvements to the grant program.  Thank you for considering the impact to larger teams.

Would you mind clarifying two details:

1) Does the larger team need to be approved for all 4 topics in order to qualify for the team grant?  Or can the team apply for fewer topics?

2) If a larger team is selected for one of the topics, does that team take up one of the two open slots for that topic?  Or is there still an opportunity to have a larger team selected plus 2 individual/smaller team grantees.  (I hope it the latter so we have more people involved).

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-18 12:45:44 UTC | #70

Thanks for the questions! 

1. The same as for the smaller grants: Any applicant (no matter if individual / small team or larger team) should apply for individual topics and the community will decide for each topic the top 2. This means that any application can state all or just a few of the topics and can be chosen for just a subset of the topics they applied to. In the case this is an application for a team grant, the grant will just mean something else (be larger). Does this make sense?

2. Yes, for now the idea is that a team grant is treated like another grant and takes one of the two open spots.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-07-18 14:28:29 UTC | #71

Thanks @lara.  This makes sense.  I do wish that more than 2 positions were offered for each topic, but at least this is a starting point.  

I’m sure that CodeGov will apply as a team for IC-OS Version Election and for Protocol Canister Management since those are topics where we have experience.  I think we are capable of Participant Management & Node Admin as well as Subnet Management, but we need to discuss internally if our team members will be willing to review those topics.  It might also be an opportunity to seek additional people to join the CodeGov team in order to cover these topics according to the requirements of the grant program.  We will apply soon.  Thank you for extending the deadline.

Cris.MntYetti | 2024-07-18 15:24:26 UTC | #72

I haven't had much time in the last two weeks, but I finally had the opportunity to sit down and properly evaluate this proposal. I'd like to share my feedback from two perspectives: as a non-tech team member and as a neuron holder.

**Team Member Perspective:**

As a non-technical team member, I've developed a basic understanding to navigate this space. After months working on the communication side for CodeGov, I've come to appreciate the significant effort required to review proposals like this. This task demands deep knowledge and experience, which is essential for maximizing voting rewards for everyone involved. 

Beyond technical reviews, effective branding and community engagement are crucial. Keeping the community informed about behind-the-scenes activities and the impact of proposals on user experience is a full-time job. This involves reading through forums, preparing content calendars, responding to inquiries, and more. Many developers may not have the time or interest to handle these tasks, especially as most do this as a side hustle in addition to their day jobs.

To build a reliable named neuron and shift away from Dfinity, a structured organization is needed where developers focus on development and communicators handle community engagement. I discuss this in more detail in [my article on Nuance](https://nuance.xyz/mntyetti/10021-434go-diaaa-aaaaf-qakwq-cai/why-diverse-organizations-matter).

**Neuron Holder Perspective:**

I joined this ecosystem in May 2021 after seeing ICP's vision and long-term roadmap. I hold an 8-year non-dissolving neuron since mid-July 2021. Over the years, I've adjusted my following parameters to balance maximizing rewards and ensuring my voting power aligns with my values, while also aiming to decentralize away from Dfinity.

However, with the proposed structure, a concern arises: if the community votes for teams/reviewers I'm unfamiliar with, I'll need to research them. What if they don't meet my standards or share my values? In such cases, I'd likely revert to following Dfinity, which defeats the proposal's purpose. 

Even if I find a team I agree with, there's no guarantee they will continue long-term if they lose funding. This instability means I'd constantly need to research new teams, leading me to default back to Dfinity for consistency. As a neuron holder, I seek stability, and this proposal doesn't ensure that from my understanding.

While the proposed structure encourages more people to take on review tasks, it doesn't guarantee long-term performance for these new teams. For neuron holders, stability and reliability are key. If I need to spend a week researching applicants every six months, I might as well stick with Dfinity, which is counterproductive to the proposal's goal.

I don't have a clear solution, as balancing decentralization and long-term stability is challenging. As mentioned in my Nuance article, I advocate for more structured organizations like CodeGov, which excels in detailed technical reviews and, hopefully, in community engagement as well.

I hope this feedback helps those working on this proposal find the right balance, ensuring teams can perform long-term with each member focusing on their strengths. This would bring stability and reliability for neuron holders, without overburdening individuals with tasks outside their interests.

-------------------------

0xkookoo | 2024-07-18 16:49:55 UTC | #73

This feedback is very sincere and insightful, respect!

Regular payment may result in hiding learning resources and unfair competition, I have **recommendation 3** as below.

**Adopting an individual/team milestone-based incentive mechanism:**

Instead of fixed monthly compensation, one-time rewards would be provided based on the completion of milestone tasks. The milestone tasks could include the number of review tasks completed, the number of consecutive review tasks completed (to ensure the continuity of contributions), the number of serious issues identified, and Dfinity developer satisfaction levels.

This approach can effectively incentivize the review personnel's enthusiasm, while not affecting the openness of the shared training resources and fairness between collaboration.

I would like Aviate Labs to be considered for the **Participant Management & Node Admin Team grant.** In the past year, I’ve engaged with many of you mainly within the community of ICP Node Providers, but for those of you who I haven’t met yet:

My name is Louise Velayo, and I am applying on behalf of Aviate Labs.

### About Aviate Labs and Our Team

Aviate Labs: [Website](https://www.aviatelabs.co/) | [Twitter](https://x.com/AviateLabs) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aviate-labs/?viewAsMember=true) | [Github](https://github.com/aviate-labs)

Louise Velayo: [Twitter](https://x.com/LouiseVelayo) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisematiasivvelayo/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/louisevelayo)

Quint Daenen: [Twitter](https://x.com/q_uint8) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quint-daenen/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/q-uint)

Roald Parmentier: [Twitter](https://x.com/roald_pa) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roaldparmentier/)

### Relevant Experience

* Aviate Labs has over 3 years of experience managing nodes for one of the largest node providers on the IC since its genesis.
* Aviate Labs developed and open-sourced a notification service for node providers, which we also host for free so all Node Providers can easily sign up and receive alerts.
* Aviate Labs has collaborated with DFINITY to test initial runbooks/builds and troubleshoot bugs.
* Aviate Labs has an ongoing grant for building a notification service based on public node metrics and plans to apply for future grants to further develop a platform for Node Providers.
* I organized the first [Node Provider ICP Lab](https://dfinityorg.notion.site/We-invite-you-to-ICP-Lab-NP-Node-Providers-b8b0b0cd9f90420db47d66ddf5d8b1d4), bringing together over 20 node providers to discuss process changes and future developments, and I serve as the community lead of the [Node Provider Working Group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-node-providers/30255).
* Quint Daenen has over 6 years of professional software development experience and 3+ years developing on the IC, contributing various [Motoko packages](https://github.com/aviate-labs/package-set) used by other IC projects.

### Technical Knowledge

* Aviate Labs’ Projects:
  * Autonomous Asset - A framework where digital assets can be fully sovereign on the IC. In the usecase developed in collaboration with Nodenaysteen (art gallery in gent), the file of the digital artwork, frontend and backend are hosted on a canister.
    * [Website](https://aau73-liaaa-aaaag-qb56q-cai.ic0.app/)
  * Node Monitor - A free hosted notification service that sends Node Providers dail status reports on their nodes as well as alerts as soon as their nodes go down.
    * [Website](https://www.aviatelabs.co/node-monitor) | [Github Repository](https://github.com/aviate-labs/node-monitor)
* Quint Daenen developed a [Golang agent for the IC](https://github.com/aviate-labs/agent-go) as part of a grant.

### Motivation for Becoming a Voting Neuron

Our motivation stems from our early involvement in the IC since its genesis. We believe it is essential for Aviate Labs to play a more active role in governance, particularly in participant management, to ensure that node providers are properly onboarded, as they are crucial to the IC’s infrastructure. Given our track record of contributions and the insights we’ve gained from being deeply involved in this part of the ecosystem, we believe that the responsibility of being a voting neuron best leverages our expertise and experience.

### Need for Grant Funding

Our team is fully dedicated to the IC, focusing on two primary activities: developing a support model and platform for node providers and collaborating with various clients to implement their projects on the IC. This commitment inevitably limits our time and resources for governance activities. Securing grant funding would enable us to allocate additional hours to actively vote and conduct necessary checks for node provider applications. Moreover, it would allow us to create an objective evaluation process for candidate NPs/DCs and other node administration-related proposals. This funding is crucial for us to ensure a robust and well-governed IC ecosystem, leveraging our expertise and dedication to its growth and stability.

### Long-term Interest in ICP

Our business activities are deeply intertwined with ICP. Our mission, particularly with our node provider-focused initiative, is to streamline node management and facilitate scalability, positioning the ICP infrastructure to compete with web2 giants. Acting maliciously would undermine our efforts and jeopardize our future in the industry, as it would deter potential collaborators and partners from working with us.

### Interest in Participant Management & Node Admin

Having engaged with numerous prospective and operational node providers, we have gained both the practical and technical understanding necessary for these types of proposals. Thus, our interest stems from the experience we have built in this domain. Additionally, our active participation in the Node Provider Working Group and other discussions provides us with valuable insights and the confidence to vote on these matters effectively.

### Commitment to Long-term Voting

We will continue to serve as a voting neuron even after the grant period, as our support and tool development for node providers require a well-organized, decentralised, and growing community. By understanding the profiles of entities interested in becoming node providers and the common administrative tasks they need to perform through proposals, we can develop better tools to support them effectively.

### Voting Principles

Our primary voting principle is to adhere strictly to decentralization principles. This currently involves voting in accordance with the community-agreed target topology. Future voting will align with the community’s conclusions from ongoing discussions about adapting to the target topology, improving KYC for Node Providers and data centers, and decentralizing the onboarding process for node providers.

We are excited about the opportunity to contribute to the ICP community in a more structured and impactful way. Thank you for considering our application :pray:

Hi @lara and ICP community,

My name is Wenzel Bartlett, founder of **CodeGov**.  This is our formal application for the Grants for Voting Neurons program offered by DFINITY.  

### TL;DR
We have decided to apply for all four team grant opportunities, which includes [IC-OS Version Election](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai), [Protocol Canister Management](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/168083459961697538699863191526193241390/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai), [Subnet Management](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/19625648570830622662772248501612437419/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai), and [Participant Management](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/324352774006988329354260824487234716358/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai) & [Node Admin](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/261185533762247244401204502467932456179/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai).  The CodeGov team has been reviewing and voting independently on technical NNS proposals for over a year.  We hope to continue making an impact on the decentralization of NNS governance through funding from this program.  We are a larger team of developers from the ICP community who have the skills to provide an educated evaluation of proposal details, document their findings, and a willingness to vote reliably on every proposal.  There are 8 reviewers on our team along with a marketing manager and a project manager.

### CodeGov
Details about the CodeGov organization including our [manifesto](https://www.codegov.org/manifesto), [team members, and known neuron configuration](https://www.codegov.org/neuron) can always be found on our website at [codegov.org](https://www.codegov.org/).  The configuration of the CodeGov known neuron is actively managed to ensure that Followees for each proposal topic are selected who are fully committed and available to perform detailed reviews within 48 hours proposal creation.  The CodeGov known neuron vote is cast automatically by consensus of our reviewers who are configured as Followees for the topics in which we specialize.  In the rare event that we cannot reach consensus automatically due to unforeseen circumstances, then vote for the CodeGov neuron is cast manually based on feedback from the reviewers who have been able to complete their review the proposal within this timeframe.  Hence, we always strive to complete our reviews as soon as possible and well before DFINITY votes.  

The CodeGov neuron owns the minimal amount of voting power required to participate in NNS governance, but we trigger 5-6% total voting power in the NNS for the topics that we cover.  Hence, the voting power that we trigger is 100% provided by other neurons who have chosen to follow us on these topics.  This is a great honor and a heavy responsibility that we take very seriously.  It inspires us to perform our due diligence on every proposal and reminds us that our work has been making a difference to the NNS governance community.

In addition to participation in NNS voting, we also have a [CodeGov WTN neuron](https://oc.app/community/3fudd-diaaa-aaaar-bgmca-cai/channel/139936864411093443261235657527242394420/0/1?open=true) that votes on WaterNeuron proposals.  [WaterNeuron](https://docs.waterneuron.fi/) is a liquid staking protocol built on ICP that owns very large 6 month and 8 year neurons and enables WTN token owners to cast the votes for these large NNS neurons.  CodeGov participates in the WTN governance process because it is open to the community and has a growing influence on NNS governance.  We have built a vote relay canister that automatically casts the same vote on WTN NNS proposals that CodeGov already casts on NNS proposals.  The WaterNeuron team recently [announced](https://x.com/WaterNeuron/status/1816905884423065740) that it is following the CodeGov WTN neuron on the WTN proposal topic called “Vote on NNS Proposals”.  This is another honor, privilege, and responsibility that demonstrates the positive impact that CodeGov has been making on the ICP community.

### IC-OS Version Election
CodeGov reviewers have over a year of experience reviewing IC-OS Version Election proposals and we have 6 reviewers who are dedicated to continuing that effort if we are awarded the grant for this topic.  These reviewers include @Lorimer @ZackDS @Zane @cyberowl @hpeebles @ilbert.  There are many examples of prior reports that our reviewers have posted that can be found in our [IC-OS Version Election channel](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai) in our CodeGov community on OpenChat, which is a strong demonstration of our qualifications on this topic.

### Protocol Canister Management
We have 2 months of experience reviewing System Canister Management proposals, which includes all canisters that are included in the new topic titled Protocol Canister Management.  We have 5 reviewers who are dedicated to continuing that effort if we are awarded the grant for this topic.  These reviewers include @ZackDS @Zane @cyberowl @LaCosta @timk11.  There are many examples of prior reports that our reviewers have posted that can be found in our [System Canister Management channel](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/168083459961697538699863191526193241390/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai) in our CodeGov community on OpenChat, which is a strong demonstration of our qualifications on this topic.

### Participant Management & Node Admin
We have decided to apply for the Participant Management & Node Admin grant because we have 4 reviewers who are willing to review these topics if we are awarded the grant.  They are already gaining experience on these proposal topics by performing reviews on a few past proposals and all current proposals.  Based on this experience and our evaluation of the difficulty / effort required to perform these reviews, we believe we have the skill and capacity required.  Our reviewers will include @ZackDS @LaCosta @timk11 @Cris.MntYetti.  You can see the reports of our reviewers in our [Participant Management channel](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/324352774006988329354260824487234716358/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai) and our [Node Admin channel](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/261185533762247244401204502467932456179/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai) in our CodeGov community on OpenChat, which we offer as evidence of our qualifications on this topic.

### Subnet Management
We have decided to apply for the Subnet Management grant because we have 3 reviewers who are willing to review this topic if we are awarded the grant.  They are already gaining experience on this proposal topic by performing reviews on a few past proposals and all current proposals.  Based on this experience and our evaluation of the difficulty / effort required to perform these reviews, we believe we have the skill and capacity required.  Our reviewers will include @ZackDS @LaCosta @timk11.  You can see the reports of our reviewers in our [Subnet Management channel](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/19625648570830622662772248501612437419/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai) in our CodeGov community on OpenChat, which we offer as evidence of our qualifications on this topic.

One of our team members and regular IC-OS Version Election reviewers, @Lorimer, is keen to maximize the funded time that he can allocate to Subnet Management proposals.  Therefore, he is planning to submit a separate application for this topic as an individual reviewer. He will provide more context in his application, but please note that he has the full support of the CodeGov project to pursue the grant for this topic on his own.  He is a very strong candidate for this grant.

### Voting Principles
While the teams listed above is our current plan to staff these reviews for any proposal topic where we are awarded a grant, we reserve the right to change these teams and our known neuron Followee configuration as needed.  We will actively manage our team membership in a way that ensures we have skilled reviewers dedicated to each topic who can make the time and resource commitment to these reviews for the duration of the grant program.  Hence, if anyone needs to drop out for personal reasons or because they are not in compliance with the grant requirements or our CodeGov team standards, then we will recruit and train others to fill their spots.  We also may add additional team members as needed to ensure that we are able to fulfill our commitment to these proposal topics in the most reliable way possible.  Performing technical reviews of NNS proposals is real work that requires skilled developers who are dedicated to the task every week.  It can only be accomplished reliably with adequate funding that developers are willing to accept.  Our reviewers are asked to review each proposal for technical correctness and compliance with established work processes defined by the NNS community and/or DFINITY and to vote on each proposal with their own convictions.  They are expected to explain and defend their vote, but to always remain diplomatic and civilized in how they make their case.  The fact that we have a larger team provides a safety in numbers where individual reviewers can have an opinion that differs from the rest of the reviewers, which provides an opportunity to raise awareness of differing opinions.  Having a larger team enables us to be flexible in our organizational structure and work processes to ensure we are a reliable known neuron to follow on any proposal topic.  We have spent a lot of time trying to gain experience and credibility as reviewers of technical NNS proposals and one of our goals is continuous improvement.

### Final Remarks
Thank you for the opportunity to apply for these grants.  Whether or not we get some or all the grants, CodeGov will remain committed to supporting decentralization of the NNS through active participation in governance.  Our neuron will always be configured to follow people and organizations in the ICP community who have publicly announced that they are committed to being reliable and educated Followees on any proposal topic.  We will not follow anyone who pencil whips their vote or casts automatic yes or no votes without first making a concerted effort to review technical details and vote with an educated opinion.  If we cannot find suitable Followees for a specific topic, then of course we will follow DFINITY on that topic.  DFINITY is an appropriate Followee for any topic because they offer an educated and active voice on all NNS changes.  However, if decentralization is our goal, then CodeGov is here as an option to help enable the ICP community to move in that direction.

### Our Vision & Why to be a Voting Neuron?

Our involvement in the ICP ecosystem has been both professional and personal since its early days. Through our work with ICP HUB BULGARIA and ICP COMMUNITY BULGARIA, we have established a significant presence in the region, which has emerged as a key Web3 hub and education community in the Balkans. Given this strong foundation, we are excited about the opportunity to become a voting neuron for ICP. This role would allow us to delve deeper into the governance of the Internet Computer, focusing on both participant and subnet management to further advance the protocol.

### Why Participant Management, Node Admin & Subnet Management

With our extensive experience in the ICP ecosystem, we believe our well-crafted insights and feedback on proposals can significantly impact the IC ecosystem, particularly in the areas mentioned above.

Furthermore, as a HUB for the Bulgarian region, we have organically cultivated a vibrant community, led by Boyan, that includes both users and developers actively engaging with the network. This community, centered around Internet Computer Bulgaria, is eager to grow and develop within the ecosystem, embracing every aspect, including the technical ones. By becoming a voting neuron, we aim to strengthen this community and contribute to the transparent and democratic model that the Internet Computer network upholds.

**Long Term Interest:**

For the last year and a half we have successfully created and established a strong footing dedicated towards ICP within the balkan region and we will continue to do so through our accelerator cohorts, partnerships as well as governance voting.

We are dedicated to supporting the ecosystem's growth and governance during the duration of the grant period and beyond.

### Why the need of funding?

Our team has been dedicated to advancing the IC ecosystem, with a central focus on establishing ICP HUB Bulgaria as the premier Web3 hub in the Balkan region. This initiative requires significant effort and hours from our diverse team, encompassing marketing, event organization, incubation, and business development.

However, this dedication to our primary objectives has constrained our ability to engage actively in governance roles within the Network Nervous System (NNS). This funding would enable us to allocate resources towards key areas such as participant management, node administration, and subnet management. With this support, we can enhance our contributions to the NNS and actively participate in the community, ensuring a balanced and sustained growth for both ICP HUB Bulgaria and the broader IC ecosystem.

### Voting Principle.

Our vision for voting principles centers on transparency, decentralization, and thorough elaboration. Each of our votes will be accompanied by detailed feedback and a clear explanation of the outcome, ensuring all stakeholders within the ecosystem are well-informed and everything is shared transparently across forums and designated channels.

Thank you for taking the time to read our proposal and consider our application. We would be honored to have the opportunity to further advance the ecosystem.

Proposals, like governance in general, should be (a) going in a direction the community thinks is good and (b) should actually achieve their stated aims.  Those are really different types of checks.  "Does it do what it says on the tin" isn't well served by a popular vote, it's something for the mavens out there.  But, yes, even that army of mavens needs to be decentralized somehow.

Case study: In Switzerland the governance system involves a lot of "politicians need to make concrete proposals, then there is a long time of due diligence" and I think it does a fairly good job of filtering out populist sound-bytes.  Far from perfect, there are plenty of campaigns based on fear-mongering but I feel that this "put your cards on the table and let us examine them" helps to keep it in check.

### Voting Principles

Core Principle: Decentralization

* Definition and Relevance: The Nakamoto Coefficient measures the number of entities that must collude to control a system. A higher coefficient signifies greater decentralization and, consequently, a more secure and resilient network.
* Application to Voting: Applying this principle to voting within the IC ecosystem, we emphasize the need for a diverse and decentralized set of voters to prevent centralization and ensure fair representation of the community’s interests.

Ensuring Robust Decentralization

* Diverse Voting Participation: By adhering to decentralization principles, our voting approach aligns with the IC community and foundation. This means advocating for broad participation across various stakeholders to avoid power concentration.

Evolving with Community Decisions

* Adaptive Voting Strategy: Our commitment to evolving voting strategies based on community discussions reflects a dynamic approach to maintaining and enhancing decentralization. We plan to formalize a process in which we will actively listen to community inputs and adapt our voting accordingly.
* Continuous Improvement: By aligning future voting with community conclusions on decentralization, our approach ensures that the network remains resilient to centralization risks, analogous to maintaining a high Nakamoto Coefficient.

We are eager to contribute to the ICP community in a structured and impactful way. Thank you for considering our application. 🙏

Lorimer | 2024-07-30 19:22:29 UTC | #83

Hi, my name's **Alex Lorimer**. I'm an experienced full-stack Web2 developer who discovered the IC within the last year. I'd like to formally register my application as a **Subnet Management** proposal reviewer. I'm a member of [Synapse](https://www.synapse.vote/voting-members) and [CodeGov](https://www.codegov.org/neuron), and also regularly review TAGGR releases (when I have the time). 

This activity is evident by checking any one of the [IC-OS releases](https://forum.dfinity.org/search?q=release%20rc-2024-%20%23release) over the last few months. My activity is also evident on TAGGR, and has involved identifying a [Severity 1 bug](https://taggr.link/#/post/1159468) among other contributions.

#### Why I'm Applying As An Individual

I'm applying for this topic as an individual reviewer (while I'll still be participating in IC-OS election propopsal reviews as part of CodeGov, as @wpb mentioned above). My motivation for applying as an individual is that I believe the funded time allocation for Subnet Management is too small to be able to make as significant an impact as I'd like (when split multiple ways).

Subnet Management is an important topic that I believe currently suffers from a lack of easily accessible contextual information during the voting process. If I'm selected as a reviewer I'll endeavour to make this job easier by building reporting tools that quickly highlight details that may not otherwise have been obvious. The long-term idea would be to make these tools publicly accessible (once refined) for the sake of greater governance decentralisation. Ideas that I'm toying with are...
- Visualise added/removed nodes (e.g. [fuqsr](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-fuqsr-application/33655/2)) and flag up scenarios that would result in reduced decentralisation (due to an over-represented country, node provider and/or data centre) and automatically verify the proposed nodes are currently unassigned.
![image|690x323](upload://ceApw6qhHI7d7wXj5qZExfdLFxW.jpeg)

- Display version deployments and config updates over time using a Gantt chart format, alongside timeseries data (subnet performance metrics and config values) in order to more easily verify claims made in proposal summaries, and spot potential for unintended consequences based on how other subnets have behaved.
- Visually cluster subnets with similar config, illustrating when a config update proposal would cause a subnet to diverge and/or converge with another *cluster* of subnets.

I believe convenient visibility of the above sorts of information is half the picture. The other half requires a reviewer to keep up-to-date with IC-OS changes (something which I believe puts CodeGov in a very strong position for Subnet Management - few others have put themselves forward for the IC-OS topic). Note that recent downtime events resulted from unintended interactions between IC-OS changes and subnet config (e.g. [System (II)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/post-mortem-subnet-uzr34-failed-upgrade-process-on-may-13-2024/30895), [System (NNS)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/june-14th-2024-nns-subnet-incident-retrospective/32198)). Oversight of both in unison is therefore invaluable.

Anyone who's followed my comments on IC-OS releases will know that I think proposal summaries are extremely important, and I reject proposals where these are inaccurate (as a matter of principle). I plan to carry this conviction into Subnet Management proposals. My belief is that the role of a reviewer isn't just to provide a neuron to be followed, but also to facilitate others in making up their own mind. I expect many in the community will take proposal summaries at face value. There's nothing wrong with that so long as others in the community take it upon themselves to validate the accuracy of these summaries, and reject when they are wrong or misleading.

-----

🙏 **Thanks for your time everyone!** I'd also like to say that I'm super excited to see such a turn out for these grants. I'm looking forward to seeing more governance activity on this forum for technical topics 🙌 Whatever the outcome regarding the grants, I'll be happy.

I've recently been creating dedicated [Subnet Management topics](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-fuqsr-application/33655) for each subnet on this forum, and I invite other Subnet Management candidates to engage in discussion on these and share your insights as new proposals emerge 🙂 (and create new topics if one doesn't already exist for the relevant subnet). Good luck everyone!

@lara @ld-dfn1 @Jan @chepreghy @cryptoschindler @jennifertran @radu and others on the growth team.

I'd like to make a case for DFINITY to support all applicants to this grant program.  There has been a decent turnout of people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and start performing the work of validating NNS technical proposals, which is something that has been sorely lacking.  This grant program is intended to be temporary, which I think is appropriate, until a long term (hopefully NNS) based solution can be defined.  However, now is the time to mobilize people who are willing to perform this work.  It takes time to learn how to perform these reviews and to do it reliably week after week.  It takes time to build a credible reputation as a reliable known neuron that people may some day be willing to follow with their NNS neuron Followee configurations.  

There is no other logical source of funding other than DFINITY / ICA to support these teams until DFINITY has time to lead the ICP community to a long term strategy that can further advance decentralization of the NNS.  Supporting only 2 teams for each proposal topic is too few and I think supporting all teams is not too far from what you have already been willing to fund.  Since DFINITY committed to fund larger teams at 2x the proposed amounts for smaller teams, this implies that a max allocation could be $56k per month if all teams selected are large teams for each proposal topic.  If you calculate the total cost for all teams that have applied, it amounts to $75.5k.  This is only 35% higher than what has already been committed.  Yet at this higher funding level it will support all 9 teams with a total of 29 participants who have applied for these grants.  This extra expense seems well worth it to give everyone a shot at making a name for themselves as credible reviewers of these topics.

I'm very excited about the fact that so many people have applied for these grants and would love to see max participation in technical proposal reviews.  Please consider increasing the funding support.  If an increased funding level would be a pain point for the distribution of DFINITY grant funds, then perhaps that would become a positive motivating factor for DFINITY to expedite moving past the grant program and into a long term solution.

Lorimer | 2024-08-15 07:59:29 UTC | #99

Hi @cryptoschindler, thanks for this. If it's not too much trouble, would it be possible to replace the start of my application text ("Hi, my name's **Alex Lorimer**.") with this instead -> "Hi, my name's **Alex Lorimer** (known neuron [LORIMER](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/known-neuron-proposal-lorimer/33850))."

I've only recently created the proposal for my known neuron, so didn't have this set up when I initially wrote my submission.

Also it looks like the application text includes the image that I posted as markdown. I don't expect this will render outside of the DFINITY forum (such as on the NNS dapp or dashboard) -> `![image|690x323](upload://ceApw6qhHI7d7wXj5qZExfdLFxW.jpeg)`. If that's the case could this be removed from the application text?

Thanks again!

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2024-08-15 11:21:03 UTC | #100

Good catch! This change is reflected in the table now.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2024-08-15 11:43:21 UTC | #101

@cryptoschindler I never provided the neuron ID for Personal DAO’s named neuron. 

Here it is: `6459874325470209959`

-------------------------

louisevelayo | 2024-08-15 12:46:04 UTC | #102

Hi @cryptoschindler, thank you for the ping! I have updated the original announcement and would like to confirm that we truly would like to apply for the team grant. 

Thank you and the team for your time and effort into putting this together :pray:

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2024-08-15 13:50:37 UTC | #103

Am I correct to assume you don't want any changes to your application text being made in the table? If not, please edit the application text itself or provide instructions for the changes you'd like to be made (see @Lorimer 's recent post for example).

-------------------------

Jesse | 2024-08-15 14:19:36 UTC | #104

@cryptoschindler, I do want to make a change to my application’s text. 

I would like to replace the following text: 

“ **My name is *Jesse D. Williams Jr.*** ”

And in its place, i would like the text to read: 

“ **My name is *Jesse D. Williams Jr.*** The neuron ID that I will be voting with on behalf of Personal DAO is:  `6459874325470209959` ”

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2024-08-15 14:22:31 UTC | #105

Thank you, this change is reflected in the table now.
