Thanks for this @Andre-Popovitch - very exciting! Just a reminder to all **Subnet Management** candidates, there are many [subnet-specific topics](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-general-discussion/34091) on this forum (more still to be created if you're up for it). So far the only applicants to engage with these are [**me**](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131762) and [**CodeGov**](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131768). These topics provide an opportunity to get involved and demonstrate your Subnet Management skills and commitment, as well as showcase your abilities to people who will be voting on these proposals. **Good luck to everyone!** 👍

smaug | 2024-08-17 00:11:22 UTC | #111

Just seeing this now. We’re going to incentivize certain neurons to vote? That’s going to be a big no vote from me on all such proposals.

-------------------------

smaug | 2024-08-17 00:14:32 UTC | #112

To clarify my position, the existing reward structure is the incentive to verify what you’re voting on.

This is a horrible idea all around. I understand it’s being implemented. I hate it. That’s all.

[/quote]

Thanks for sharing your opinion @smaug. Your concerns are perhaps something that are worthy of their own topic (please try and be diplomatic about it). Here are some points that I'd like to raise your attention to:
- You seem satisfied with the existing reward structure. You're aware that individuals are rewarded based on their stake, and not directly in terms of the time and level of due diligence they put into their vote? You may be interested in these related discussions:
  - [Proposal to elect new release rc--2024-07-10_23-01 - Governance - Internet Computer Developer Forum (dfinity.org)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-07-10-23-01/33072/5) 
  - [stakeGeek - Liquid Staking for ICP - General - Internet Computer Developer Forum (dfinity.org)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/stakegeek-liquid-staking-for-icp/31803/24) 
- Here's a Subnet Management proposal review that I just posted -> [Subnet Management - 4zbus (Application) - Developers - Internet Computer Developer Forum (dfinity.org)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-4zbus-application/34056/10). Do you expect the existing voting rewards mechanism to incentivise voters to put this much work into verifying technical proposals, even though they'd get the same voting rewards from an instant accept or reject (blind voting). Note that [**diffusion of responsibility**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility) may seem well and good to many voters, until it's pushed too far and something snaps.
- You may have overlooked the fact that these grants are only temporary, and will be replaced in roughly 6 months with a new voting rewards system that seeks to overcome some of the issues with the current system (the grants are to help more reviewers gain a following and hit the ground running when the new rewards mechanism launches)

Let's not overtake this topic with a back and forth. If you'd like to discuss further, maybe start a dedicated topic and link to it from here. 🙂

Jesse | 2024-08-18 13:04:46 UTC | #114

Is there a limit to how many grants a single team can receive? At the current rate of progression, it looks like @wpb & Co. are due to receive 5 of the 8 grants available (4 for CodeGov and 1 for @Lorimer who is a member of the CodeGov team if I'm not mistaken). 

It seems this would undermine the original goal of this grant program: 

[quote="lara, post:1, topic:32721"]
to increase governance participation and decentralization in the NNS, we propose to introduce *periodic confirmation* and *incentives for actively voting neurons.*
[/quote]

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-08-18 14:02:33 UTC | #115

Hey @Jesse I appreciate your concern on this issue.  Personally, I believe there are too few grants being offered for this work as I expressed several times in this thread.  I'd like to see at least 4 grants awarded for each topic, if not more.  

However, no matter what number of grants are going to be awarded, I believe that the CodeGov team has been diligently working on proving our credibility in each of the proposal topics.  We post our reviews in the respective channel in the [CodeGov community on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/?ref=ffpc5-aiaaa-aaaaf-aacva-cai).  For anyone paying attention to the forum on posts about these proposals, you will see that our team is constantly asking questions or providing feedback regarding our observations on these technical proposals.  Hence, we have applied for grants for all 4 proposal topics because we have teams that can perform this work and we have demonstrated capability.  CodeGov has only applied for one grant on each of the 4 proposal topics, which are all unique.

@Lorimer has decided to apply for Subnet Management on his own.  He is on our team for IC-OS Version Election, but is is not on the CodeGov team that is planning to review the Subnet Management topic.  I fully support his interest in applying for this topic as an individual and he has done more than anyone, by far, to prove his capability and credibility on this topic.  Hence, the reality is that CodeGov and @Lorimer are competing as equals along with 7 other applicants for the 2 grants that are being offered for Subnet Management.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2024-08-18 14:19:29 UTC | #116

I have no doubts about your credibility as an active voting neuron. My concerns are with respect to decentralization. If the goal of this grant is to incentivize more entities of comparable credibility to participate as active voting neurons, then it seems counterproductive for the majority of the grants to be distributed to a single coterie. 

While your team's technical expertise is paramount regarding your role as a voting neuron, there are still other factors to be considered (i.e. geographical location, the political environment in which your company operates, your company's interests/priorities, the financial viability of your company's business, etc...). Regarding these other factors, CodeGov (and Co.) pose just as much counterparty risk as any other team. 

The goal of decentralizing the voting power on the IC is to hedge against these risks. 

There are several credible teams that have applied to this grant who have the expertise, needed to contribute to responsible governance of the IC. Whatever happens, I'll offer my support since we all share a vested interests in seeing the IC succeed, but I do believe it would be a mistake to concentrate so much funding to a single clique when there are other teams stepping up.

Best of luck to everyone.

[/quote]

I think it's probably worth clarifying points about what CodeGov is (it's not representative to describe CodeGov as a coterie or clique).

We're all geographically distributed, living under different jurisdictions, have different voting principles and convictions, etc. If I disappeared tomorrow, CodeGov would obviously still be operating. If CodeGov disappeared tomorrow (not happening, it's a decentralised collective), I would still be operating (assuming the community decides to accept my Subnet Management application).

Out of interest are you able to point to any examples of Subnet Management reviews that these teams have been conducting (to demontrate their credibility/expertise **on this topic**). I've been inviting this repetitively, but haven't come across anything so far from any candidate other than myself and CodeGov.

Web3 / effective decentralisation requires claims to be easily demonstrable and verifiable with evidence. In my opinion it's not enough to just put yourself forward. :slightly_smiling_face:

-------------------------

Jesse | 2024-08-18 15:45:44 UTC | #118

I understand CodeGov operates as a single entity within the ICP ecosystem. As such, I assume you all work together, converse, and collaborate with each other on a regular basis as any team does. I maintain my previous characterization of CodeGov as a coterie in adherence to the literary definition of a coterie( see the [merriam-webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coterie) here.)

regarding the following:

[quote="Lorimer, post:117, topic:32721"]

Example reviews are not the only way to establish credibility with respect to qualification of performing this task. Speaking for myself, I've spent several years developing on top of and troubleshooting bugs that have emerged within the IC stack and that includes Subnet management. 

I also happen to know that at least one other applicant hosts his own ICP node. To do so mandates a level of understanding of the subnet systems that would make him a great candidate as well.

EnzoPlayer0ne | 2024-08-18 16:14:45 UTC | #119

As I am voting on those proposals, I now realize there are only two applicants for the topic of "IC-OS Version Election." Two parties are elected per topic, so they are the de facto choice. I believe there should be more variety for a topic as crucial as the IC-OS election. 

Hence, I am also applying to become a reviewer for the "IC-OS Version Election" topic.

I'm Enzo; I worked for the DFINITY Foundation for about two years as a software engineer. I was on the Internal Development Experience team, contributing to various infrastructure projects, CI, Bazel, and automation, and then went on to specialize in build-reproducibility,  which is paramount in IC-OS elections. 

I helped the DRE team with releases most weeks and ensured the CI produced the correct IC-OS images. More recently, I helped remediate a reproducibility bug in the IC-OS image in February, which blocked the release for that week. I am intimately familiar with the whole release process. 

My GitHub username is EnzoPlayer0ne. I am the 22nd most active contributor on the IC repository (https://github.com/dfinity/ic/graphs/contributors). I also contributed to the Oisy wallet for the airdrop held this past September (https://github.com/dfinity/oisy-wallet).

I have represented the DFINITY Foundation at various conferences and understand what makes the network unique, and a large part of it is the speed of updates on the IC-OS. This allows the network to evolve at a faster rate than any other blockchain. It enables us to push the boundaries of what's possible on the chain! 

If you want to hear my personal views about the network, I talked about in the opening panel of the network's third anniversary alongside Tom Serres - https://youtu.be/tJMm-awr9FI?si=kEO7d4mKGMygU7mQ. 

I am also an early contributor to WaterNeuron (waterneuron.fi), which aims to allow liquid staking in a fully decentralized manner.

If you have any additional questions, you can reach out to me through the forum or on X @sisyphusdancing.

Members of CodeGov review and vote independently and can often hold differing opinions, with differing votes. We sometimes discuss specific proposals on the OC much like the whole community can discuss proposals on the DFINITY forum. Note that I vote using my known LORIMER neuron, which can be followed independently of CodeGov.

Great! Did the Personal DAO dev team have any concerns or important observations about the proposal? I'd like to think that applicants for these grants will be sharing all of their reviews and findings openly with the community.

A good place to post this would be on [the specific subnet forum topic](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-4zbus-application/34056) :slight_smile:

Of course I'm not trolling (I don't know why you'd think that). I linked to an appropriate thread for this discussion (for the proposal). I'd like to see more governance activity on this forum. That's what this grant program is surely about. A more active NNS DAO (with diligent voting that's evidenced by proof of work).

Sure, bud. 

I’m sure your unsolicited invitation to participate in the subnet topic forum post within the current context of this discussion is totally well intentioned and is in no way facetious. And of course it’s not meant to deflect from my earlier point stated [Here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/grants-for-voting-neurons/32721/116?u=jesse)


As I’ve said, thank you for the invitation. And enjoy your day. If you feel compelled to carry on this discussion, feel free to send me a DM. You can finish gaslighting me there.

wpb | 2024-08-19 01:56:38 UTC | #128

Wow.  This was an opportunity missed for you @Jesse.  You explicitly said that you already reviewed and voted on the proposal that @Lorimer referenced.  Instead of providing some simple explanations on what you think about the proposal, you resorted to name calling in a condescending tone.  He served you with the perfect opportunity to demonstrate why you are qualified to review one of the proposal types for which you applied.  You didn’t even have to provide full details here because you can provide a link.  The application guidelines specifically recommended that all applicants convincingly show in their application that they are able to do the required verification tasks.  This grant program also requires that you are willing and able to explain your votes on every proposal.  You haven’t provided any evidence yet and Lorimer gave you a perfect opportunity.  I think you completely misread the value and intent of his questions.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2024-08-19 02:22:37 UTC | #129

Within the context of this discussion, it’s obvious that his invitation was a disingenuous attempt to deflect from my original point rather than a genuine request for my input. And his follow up, (similar to yours) is an attempt to gaslight the situation.


[quote="wpb, post:128, topic:32721"]

[/quote]

At no point did i call anyone any names. nice try, maybe the next narrative will stick. 

As far as tones go, i would argue that you and @Lorimer are the one’s condescending. 
 

This conversation has gone far off topic at this point. This will be my final response. I wish both of you a good day and best of luck in your endeavors.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2024-08-19 11:42:39 UTC | #132

Hello everyone,

We recently received a late proposal submission for the “IC-OS Version Election” topic by @EnzoPlayer0ne , and we wanted to address the situation transparently. After reviewing the process and considering the fairness of next steps, we wanted to share some thoughts:

- Unfortunately, the applicant did not follow the process outlined in the thread. Specifically, he missed the deadline that was provided.
  
- Given this, we believe it would be unfair to consider his proposal. There may be others who held back from applying after realizing they had missed the deadline, and accepting this submission could undermine the integrity of the process.

- If we were to consider his proposal, it would defeat the purpose of the structured process we set up in the first place. Making exceptions could create inconsistencies.

- We do acknowledge that having more applicants would have been beneficial for this topic. However, it has been clear for some time that we would only submit two proposals for this particular topic. Anyone interested had sufficient time to act within the proposed deadline.

- As this is a new initiative, we are committed to learning and improving as we move forward. We will certainly reflect on this and iterate on the process. In the future, we may consider adjustments, including additional funding, more reviewers, or extending deadlines where appropriate.

We appreciate everyone's understanding and look forward to continuing this work together :pray:

-------------------------

EnzoPlayer0ne | 2024-08-19 12:28:24 UTC | #133

Hi Mortiz, I'm afraid I must disagree with your position. 

It is nearly impossible to follow up on every thread on the forum daily, especially one as active as this one. As stated in my proposal, while I was voting and looking up every applicant, I realized the need for more depth for the most crucial topic: the IC-OS version election. 

IC-OS version is the most heavily weighted category, and the lack of competition should not be a default win for all applicants. The initial goal of this grant is to decentralize the reviewers and let the community elect parties they trust to help them make a judgment. Given this is not currently the case, I  threw my hat in the ring at the last minute, less than 48 hours after the Foundation made the proposals. 

In the spirit of fairness, I should not have more parameters than the other applicants. **As a result, I am proposing to tally the votes for my proposal when all the others submitted by the Foundation end.** If anything, that would penalize me as I would have had less time to make my case. However, given my late reply to this thread, it would be a fair outcome.

We agree that it’s not always easy to keep up with threads in the forum, but we expect parties interested in participating in grants for voting neurons to monitor the topic closely. For this particular initiative, we tried to ensure it reached as many people as possible. This included posting about the initiative on X (see [here](https://x.com/DFINITYDev/status/1811052762831937703) and [here](https://x.com/DFINITYDev/status/1809811169961771158)) and communicating via developer channels. The fact that there were only two applicants for the “IC-OS version election” topic was clearly visible in the posts within this thread.

For now, the DFINITY Stiftung is compensating the grantees for their contributions. To ensure a clear, transparent, and fair process, we established several requirements for participating in the program. One of these was adhering to [the deadline](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/grants-for-voting-neurons/32721/75?u=cryptoschindler) (July 31) for applying. 
Your application missed this deadline by more than two weeks. As mentioned earlier, if we were to make an exception now and lift this restriction, it would undermine the integrity of the process and could be considered unfair by participants who adhered to the process or entities that did not submit their application because they realized they had missed the deadline.It’s unfortunate that your application cannot be considered because, as you mentioned, the goal of this program is to decentralize the proposal reviewers for the specified topics and nurture a culture of strong, genuine reviewers. Of course, we would have been happy to submit another proposal for an additional entity, especially since, as you pointed out, there are currently only two applicants for the “IC-OS version election”.

If you have any feedback on how we can further improve this process in the future to prevent similar situations, we would love to hear it.
