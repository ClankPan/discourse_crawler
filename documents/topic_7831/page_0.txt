I have a canister on the local network and I'm trying to run ```dfx deploy --no-wallet```, yet I get the error "The request timed out.". How do I get around this? Currently, I've uploaded about 1000 blobs representing images < 1MB to the canister. Is the high storage usage making me time out? Timing out seems like it shouldn't happen, as < 200 MB storage is not that much. How am I supposed to upgrade the canister correctly?
