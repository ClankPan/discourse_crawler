## **Project highlights**

Orderswap Layer2 mainly relies on Dfinity's cross-chain capabilities to connect all public chains. At the same time, through Layer2's high TPS, it meets the needs of high-performance blockchain applications, such as transactions, social networking, e-commerce, etc.

## **How is it built**

Build on rust

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

Dfinityâ€™s TECDSA and TEDDSA and T-SCHNORR to be released in the future provide critical support for integrating multiple chains from the bottom up.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

Decentralized exchanges that support the entire chain of assets, are gas-free, support all mainstream wallets, and have centralized performance have product advantages. At the same time, we have a good community and early bird users
## **Monetization**

Of course, for unprofitable projects, where will the R&D expenses come from? SNS is not considered at the moment

## **Status of the project**

Coming online soon. Million TPS

## **Resources**

## **Future Plans**

We will continue to iterate this Layer 2, which will provide infrastructure support for our DEX in the initial stage. When it matures in the future, it can provide a powerful infrastructure for more projects.
