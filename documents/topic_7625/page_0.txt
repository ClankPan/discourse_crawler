My code looks like:
```
import { Actor, HttpAgent } from "@dfinity/agent";
const canisterId = "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai";
const host = "http://localhost:8000/";
const agent = new HttpAgent({ host });
```
However running the script like ts-node script.ts gives me the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'js-sha256'
```
What am I doing wrong?
