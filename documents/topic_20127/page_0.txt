Does the canister stable memory only work during canister upgrade to store the actor variables data and then restore the data after upgrades to the heap memory?
Is there a way I can store certain data in the stable memory and then use it in the heap only when I need it?
Thank you.

if you're using rust, then you can do that using [ic-stable-memory](https://github.com/seniorjoinu/ic-stable-memory)
