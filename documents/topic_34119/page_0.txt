I was watching this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZbFhRIHIiY&t=65s) about certified data and query calls. There seems to be some hand waving that one can get certified data but there is extra work that needs to be done to get the latest and greatest certified data. I guess a malicious node can dish out older responses. How can we protect against that? Can someone explain that to me? Thanks in advance.

The retrieved certified data is actually a serialized struct. You can deserialize this struct as follows:  https://github.com/C-B-Elite/CustomDelegation/blob/7a2b16acc63bb08fc596d81cdd83ec1195ed990b/example/VerifyCertification/src/main.rs#L54

In the certification's tree, you can find a 'time' field, which should be able to determine whether it is an expired certification:

Thanks for the response. I was not able to get much information about /time field either from the state tree nor from the Certified Data link. Could you please explain the significance of the /time node in the state tree and its relevance to certified data and its expiration? Thanks in advance.
