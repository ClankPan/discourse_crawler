This weeks release contains a feature build that activates the QueryStats feature. This activates the collection and aggregation of statistics of queries which are exposed via the Canisters Status API. 

As the feature implements a new payload builder and state machine in the replicated state, we want to roll it out gradually.

For a reminder what QueryStats is, see the [GlobalRnD Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSEq05qGj6Y&t=1428s).

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **129081**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/70) 

Proposal ID: **129084**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/71) 

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @ilbert, @Gekctek, and @hpeebles.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @jwiegley and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here or in the thread of each respective proposal in our community on OpenChat if you have any questions or suggestions about these reviews.

Why wasn't this added to the latest release ?  And also there is [this proposal to Update subnet tdb26 to replica version 19dbb5c ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129406) that just went live not that long ago, shouldn't have waited for the hot-fix version ? Thank you.

-------------------------

pietrodimarco | 2024-04-22 13:20:53 UTC | #7

This hotfix is targeting subnet `w4rem` which was running [release-2024-04-10_23-01-base](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/tag/release-2024-04-10_23-01-base) version so this is why we applied the hotfix to this version.
[Here](https://status.internetcomputer.org/incidents/v8b4rntjybbp) the link to the incident.
The NNS update has not yet been voted on, and the incident does not involve or affect the NNS subnet.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2024-04-22 13:27:36 UTC | #8

Thanks for the answer, I saw the Halt subnet w4rem issue but no idea what the 5 cannisters on it do, and with the btc hotfix in mind jumped to conclusion that tdb26 would be an update target. Thanks again
