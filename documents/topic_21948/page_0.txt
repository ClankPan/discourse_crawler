Hi Dfinity Team && Community Developers, about the icrc7 standard, there is also an implemented repo 
 https://github.com/pramitgaha/icrc7.git, and the Dfinity Team has assigned a bounty to the author. Now there are 1. EXT, 2.OGY, 3. ICRC7, for these three NFT protocols on IC network, my question is: can we use a unified standard in the future?(like ICRC1 standard) My proposal is ICRC7. Welcome any developers to choose the standard you want to use in your project and post it here.
