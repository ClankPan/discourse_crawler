## **Project highlights**

Using canister's threshold signature and stable storage features to build a DA layer compatible with EigenDA, providing reliable, cost-effective, and secure DA infrastructure for blockchains.

## **Web3 advantages**

Web3's DA services significantly enhance the credibility of DA data through stronger decentralization, avoiding centralized trust crises and potential tampering risks. By utilizing more secure cryptographic technologies, the security of DA signatures is improved.

## **How is it built**

The Canisters are built using Rust, utilizing crates such as ic_cdk, stable structures, and rs_merkle to implement stable data storage and data confirmation/verification features.

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

I am a long-time IC application developer and greatly appreciate IC's powerful cryptographic technology and convenient features. 

IC provides significant advantages in storage costs for ICDA compared to other DA solutions in the market. Through IC's threshold signature and vetkey technologies, more unique features are added to DA. 

Moreover, it eliminates the need for server and smart contract communication, allowing clients to interact directly with canisters. This further reduces centralization risks, service costs, and improves storage efficiency.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

We are seeking collaborations with some Layer 2 solutions, which will be disclosed in future announcements.

## **Monetization**

DA itself incurs certain storage costs, so we will charge a fee accordingly. Additionally, services such as storage and signing will result in a significant cycles burn rate for IC.

## **Status of the project**

The ICDA has completed its MVP version includes save/get of blobs and providing storage confirmations for those blobs. and will incorporate additional features and supporting toolchains in future development plans.

## **Resources**

Currently, ICDA is not open source, but you can follow [my github](https://github.com/C-B-Elite) for updates.

## **Future Plans**

Next, ICDA will officially release the MVP version along with the accompanying toolchain. We will also add more features and ensure compatibility with existing DA solutions in the future.
