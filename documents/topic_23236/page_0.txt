In addition to that, we have a second release that, thanks to the tireless work of @Tim, enables superior support for QUIC – the next level of resilient networking for the IC. The release is tagged [release-2023-09-20_23-01+quic](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/tag/release-2023-09-20_23-01%2Bquic) and has commit ID `91bf38ff3cb927cb94027d9da513cd15f91a5b04`. 
The NNS proposal is here: [IC NNS Proposal 124795 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124795).
It carries two changes:

* [[cfc9826eb](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/cfc9826eb)] Networking: feat(IC-1437): Enable QUIC state sync

* [[720f3ca15](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/720f3ca15)] Networking: update quinn

Get your votes in, so that the IC gets the improvements as fast as possible.

# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/76fd768b70d93f4650ccde8da3fe34294e6b690c/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 76fd768b70d93f4650ccde8da3fe34294e6b690c
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, and @ilbert.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @Gekctek and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here if you have any questions or suggestions.

@pietrodimarco please check the top section of the comment made by @cyberowl in our review of proposal 124790.  He identified a mistake in one of the commits that the change owner might want to know.  It wasn’t significant enough for him to vote to reject the proposal, but in the spirit of continuous improvement we hope it is useful feedback.

TL;DR Looks like a temporary fix that will be addressed later. Probably then will be fixed the use of old RFC 2822 that was obsoleted in 2008 by RFC 5322 that is used in return error for notAfter date.
