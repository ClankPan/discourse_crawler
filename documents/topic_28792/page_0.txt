## **Project highlights**

DSign is pioneering a collaborative platform designed for the world of design, similar to how GitHub operates for software development. It enables designers to share, iterate, and enhance their projects in a community-driven environment, overcoming the isolation and limitations of existing platforms like Behance and Dribble. DSign is not just for designers; it welcomes anyone interested in design, allowing contributions and discussions around design projects. Our platform addresses the need for a space where designers can take ownership, collaborate, and evolve their work with feedback from a broad community.

## **Web3 advantages**

Unlike traditional Web2 creative platforms, DSign integrates the principles of open-source collaboration and community ownership, facilitated by Web3 technology. The platform is built on the Internet Computer (IC), leveraging blockchain's decentralization to ensure that contributors not only share their work but also participate in future governance and benefit from the platform's success. This model stands in contrast to platforms like Adobe's Behance, where collaboration and ownership are more constrained.

## **How is it built**

DSign is developed using a combination of Motoko for smart contracts on the Internet Computer and front-end technologies (Svelte) for a seamless user experience. Our choice to build on IC stems from its capabilities for creating decentralized applications that are scalable, secure, and user-friendly. The architecture is designed to facilitate easy sharing of design files, collaboration through feedback, and future governance via a DAO structure. This ensures a community-driven approach where designers and contributors have a stake in the platform's direction.

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

The Internet Computer's unique features, such as its ability to run at web speed and scale, have been crucial in developing DSign. Its tamper-proof environment and tokenized governance model allow us to create a truly decentralized platform where users can safely share and collaborate on design projects. Additionally, the IC's low transaction costs make it feasible to implement microtransactions for services like paid bounties, further enhancing the collaborative experience.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

Our strategy focuses on engaging the design community through social media, design forums, and partnerships with design schools and organizations. We plan to showcase the platform's capabilities and benefits at design conferences and through online webinars. Early adopters will be incentivized with tokens that grant them voting rights in the platform's governance, encouraging a strong initial user base that can grow organically.

## **Monetization**

DSign aims to generate revenue through several streams, including subscription plans for advanced features, and facilitating paid surveys. Additionally, as the platform grows, the use of design assets to train AI models, with the consent of the creators, presents an opportunity for both the platform and the designers to earn royalties. Decentralizing governance through an SNS is part of our long-term strategy to ensure community ownership and alignment with the platform's values.

## **Status of the project**

DSign is currently in its development phase, with a functional prototype that demonstrates the core features of collaboration and feedback.
