Crypto users face hurdles converting to fiat, losing 0.5%-2.5% in the process.

2. Hotel canister: hotel management, creation by hosts, update deletion and even deletion by Admin. This canister also contains the frequency of hotels registered month wise.

3. Comment canister: deals with the comments posted on the introductory reels provided by the host of the Space. This cansiter also stores the frequency of bookings.

4. Booking canister : handles all the booking for users as well as reservation management for hotel owners. This canister contains the flow for icrc2 payments for booking the hotels.

5. Review canister: Handles the reviews posted by users on a Space, this is canister plays a significant role in calculation of hotel ratings.

6. Support canister: This canister is purely for providing support to the users. Most of its functions like resolving a ticket raised by user and replying for user support chat queries. Most of these functions have admin check for execution.
