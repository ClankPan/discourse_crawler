Is there a UI for checking canisters which are token canisters.
dashboard internetcomputer org forward slash canisters lists all canisters but I want to know which are token canisters

You can see if a canister is an ICRC1/2 [ledger](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1) or index canister (should have a `get_account_ transactions` similarly named method) by seeing if any of the distinct ICRC1/ICRC2 methods are listed under the canister functions.

Here is an example of a ICRC-1/ICRC-2 ledger canister: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/gemj7-oyaaa-aaaaq-aacnq-cai

Several DEXes and DeFi apps on ICP aggregate token information with canister details. For example, there is a token list on ICP Swap: https://info.icpswap.com/token/list and under Details, you will see token details.

yes, thanks for the feedback Jennifer, ICPSwap is good, but I wish they also index the thousands of tokens on ICP that are getting created daily, I think they only show a subset of tokens, but if you know the canisterid of any token you can see the details, but getting the canisterID of newly minted tokens is the tough part.  I want to build a UI which goes through the available canisters deployed on ICP and then only shows the ones which are tokens , it should also be able to search by canisterID. UI should show total supply, top 10 or 100 holders and percentage and liquidity if possible

going through all the dashboard canisters will be tedious, there are more than 500,000 canisters deployed on ICP, maybe a script can be developed to detect token canisters , will be interesting side project
