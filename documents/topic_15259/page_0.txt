As we all know, php occupies a huge proportion of web2 development in the world. Can php be developed on ic? Have you thought about doing php cdk?

If there is a PHP engine that compiles to Wasm that would be a good first step. If there's a Rust PHP engine that compiles to Wasm that would be even better, as it would fit very nicely into how Azle/Kybra are being developed. One issue with PHP is that, AFAIK, it doesn't have a static type system. You'll have to deal with that as canister methods must be statically typed.

That being said Demergent Labs will most likely never pursue getting PHP to run on the IC.
