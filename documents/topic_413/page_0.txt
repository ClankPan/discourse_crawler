Hello

I wanted to raise a possible issue about Float support, this piece of code compiles with some `compile_lit` log appearing.

```
    public query func getFloat(): async Float {
       0.0
    };
```

When calling this function, I receive an error with a `TODO: compile_lit`

```
Error: Query failed:
  Status: rejected
  Message: IC0503: Canister 17113599492783913909 trapped explicitly: TODO: compile_lit
```

Thanks David! There isnâ€™t full support for float data types yet, so best avoid using them in your projects just for the moment.
