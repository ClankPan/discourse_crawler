Hi everyone,
I have some questions.

* Are NNS and non-NNS subnets the same consensus algorithm?
* Are both subnets permission model by Internet Computer Association?
* Are both subnets DAO-controlled networks?
* Is the permission model the reason why the current consensus algorithm was adopted?
* What is the name of the consensus algorithm? No Name? DAO-controlled network?

Yes, the replicas (nodes) all run the same consensus algorithm, no matter the subnet type.

No, the ICA has no influence on any permission model. Assuming 'subnet permission' equals 'authorizing a node to participate in consensus for a certain subnet', then it is correct to say that subnet permissions are granted by the NNS through proposals, e.g. [this one](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/84655).

Correction: "Are both _types_ of subnets DAO-controlled?" There is only one NNS subnet right now, but many non-NNS subnets (34 as of right now, source [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnets)).
Yes, all subnets are controlled by the NNS-DAO.

 
I'm not 100% sure about the other questions, let me ask the right people.

Thank you for your response !

Does a company need permission from ICA to become a Node Provider and then permission from NNS?
Is it centralized by ICA?

No, the information you reference is outdated (and only partially true back when it was written). A node provider only requires approval by the NNS. The ICA has no say in this. Further reading:

Is it possible to have more than 1 NNS subnet?

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-10-10 10:18:02 UTC | #8

I'm not aware of any reasons why it wouldn't be possible. But I also don't see a reason to have one, at least for now. I guess if there was too much going on in the NNS for the subnet to keep up it could be split into two.

Hi @tokuryoo! Did you already take a look at the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/632.pdf) about the IC's consensus mechanism? This has some comparison with other consensus protocols. 

We simply call the protocol "Internet Computer Consensus (ICC)" in the paper.

We need a cooler name for the protocol. Something like Dfinitive 1, Dfinitive 2 maybe.

I understood. Thank you very much.

Thank you for your response ! Thank you very much.

>Did you already take a look at the paper 3 about the IC’s consensus mechanism? 

I didn't. It looks difficult and I would like to read it little by little.

I change the question.
Did Dfinity adopt Internet Computer Consensus because of the approval of nodes by NNS? Compared to PBFT, what is the level of trust required for a node?
