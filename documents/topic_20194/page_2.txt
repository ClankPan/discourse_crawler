So much to catch up on, but has EMC applied for a grant to develop and substantiate a proof of concept that is accessible on the IC right now? If so, can the link to the canister be given?

Otherwise, independent of whether this project is a possible scam (clearly it is not), it's not doing one of the most important things and setting a good precedent for the IC: a successful SNS sale without a usable dapp hosted on the IC no matter how compelling the whitepaper is a green light to any number of those who would take advantage. That's not even a reason as much as one of the main points of the grant program afaict is providing the funding to do exactly the necessary work before such an endeavor and enterprise would then do an SNS sale. 

My real point is that the IC is such a different way of understanding the architecture of decentralization, a project/dapp looking to SNS should really be of apodictic substance before SNSing: a white paper is not enough, in fact that period of open usability prior (of a live on chain (if proof of concept) dapp) to an SNS sale going live is a form of decentralized community action that's at the heart what makes the IC different. Particularly if the project already has an established base, pushing through an SNS sale without having a user experience showing all those developers in its base what's (at least) possible on the IC is likely causing the IC to miss out on significant organic growth ("establishing familiarity") opportunity.

Not to flush your buffer or anything... it's certainly possible for that kind of thing to happen after the SNS sale, but so far the SNS is setup for single use.

## Clear Opportunity
The idle computational power of crypto miners is an untapped resource that can be harnessed to create a robust, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly marketplace. This business model has the potential to disrupt the computational power market by providing more accessible and affordable resources to users, while also increasing the profitability of crypto mining. It’s a win-win scenario for miners, users, and the environment.

## Reward > Risk
I would like to seize this moment to extend my heartfelt thanks and admiration to the team for choosing to open source the code for this project. This decision not only marks a substantial accomplishment for the project, but it also demonstrates a deep-seated dedication to transparency, collaboration, and shared innovation, which are fundamental tenets of the open-source community. This move significantly diminishes associated risks and bolsters trust in the team spearheading this project's development. While there's still a need to examine the code and comprehend the architecture, we now have the ability to view and understand the work at its source.

## Competition
Golem Network is excited to introduce a GPU computing proof of concept (PoC) using Stable Diffusion as a use case. The PoC, which runs on the Golem Network platform, was inspired by the project developed by the community member maugnorbert and brings a new application for Golem Network: access to decentralized GPU computing power.

The PoC is a text-to-image generator inspired by the AI-based Stable Diffusion model. Users can type keywords on this tool to automatically generate images. With this PoC, Golem Network has integrated the Stable Diffusion text-to-image model with the decentralized Golem Network platform as a backend, showcasing its GPU computing possibilities.

## ICP Marriage
The project is making a strategic move by building elements beyond the core protocol atop the Internet Computer (ICP). The EMC team will retain control over source changes to EMC as they possess the necessary keys. However, transactions and funds will be contained within canisters, with the SNS managing the marketplace. The critical question is whether the team plans to exclusively build on ICP. If they opt to incorporate other chains, what will be the implications for shareholders? How will their value be either increased or diluted? It's crucial for shareholders to have confidence that their investment will appreciate over time.

Moreover, it's essential to understand how the community can contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. Will there be opportunities to earn rewards for building user interfaces and tooling? The community's involvement can significantly enhance the overall development and success of the project. Clarifying these points will strengthen the trust of shareholders and the wider community in the project's growth trajectory and strategic decisions.

I was a silent listener in today's AMA. In any DD, while nothing is certain, one gradually gets the feel of the project and people driving it. This then gets followed up through architecture,  design and implementation that is shared. 

Nothing that follows is legal or financial advice. It is for education and entertainment purpose only. DYOR.

Overall my impression of the AMA was quite positive. Thanks @alxgoh @zed.emc for presenting and answering questions.

I think that persuasive case was made on the business model behind EMC. It is clear that @alxgoh & @zed.emc were quite prepared with the answers from the business perspective.

From a technical perspective,  one concern was essentially(i am paraphrasing): "how wedded is EMC to IC"?  The answer here could have been stronger. Nevertheless the case was made that as a L2 , EMC would rollup to IC. Knowing the architecture of IC as i do, I do believe that once a commitment is made from a L2 perspective to an L1(IC) in this scenario,  it would be rather difficult to switch to another L1. However the proof of the pudding will be in the analysis of the integrating code.

The reason that i found the answer to the above question not as strong was because a pivot was made to reference conversation with Dom. I believe that it would have been stronger,  imo, without obvious name dropping. I believe also that the host should have translated the questions to Chinese to enable Zed to answer (a hint for the next AMA).

I look forward to the next AMA.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-06-08 23:09:13 UTC | #225

@emc, @ninadou , @alxgoh , @zed.emc 

Thanks for hosting the second AMA. While  I was invited to speak and ask questions at this AMA, due to a unscheduled conflict, I could not make it. I apologize. 

Nothing that follows is financial or legal advice. It is meant for education and entertainment purpose only. DYOR.

Thanks @icarus @zire for participating in this AMA as interested parties outside of EMC. I believe that @zire spoke on behalf of Dfinity in this AMA. @zire please correct the above if not true.

These are my impressions of the recording that i reviewed. 

I was pleased to learn that @zed.emc mentioned that he was still learning about the IC  from a potential perspective for EMC. "Knowledge is proud that she knows so much, Wisdom is humble that she knows no more".

In his session,  @zed.emc covered that EMC could potentially become a distributed hugging-face with the ability to run models in the same user experience as model training. He thought it possible to have this developed in a couple of months. (I think that this is way too aggressive,  but i will come back to it). 

He , then, discussed an real world workflow of game development on EMC that could significantly reduce the art-development and design time, money and speed aspect of it. This is a useful use-case because it links EMC & IC to a use case outside of the "crypto" eco chamber. My impression is that how it would be really operationalized(think Unity, Blender) is something that would need a documented workflow. 

Additionally he announced an Hackathon in late July; which would be awesome for AI developers. This would be more a carnival style hackathon. My impression is that this is a great idea; however significant preparation time is needed to be devoted before now and the hackathon; so that the platform is ready for the onslaught as well as enough documentation is created and translated for the developers to be effective. Having it in a Carnival style is brilliant idea!
 
Somewhere it was discussed that the stable diffusion model as a POC was quite successful with early adopters. While UX can be improved greatly, i think that this was good progress.

@alxgoh gave a rundown of the business aspects of EMC; bringing down the cost of GPU compute to 10-20% of AWS cost. If these numbers can be achieved,  it would be a game changer; as i have mentioned before. He also acknowledged that a lot more GPU compute power needs to be brought on; for which the team is negotiating with large former ETH miners.

@zire mentioned that he was impressed with the street creds of the EMC team. He also mentioned that EMC could be one of the "unicorns" in the crypto space through a real life use case (I imagine something like game development).

@icarus came with the perspective of hosting EMC & IC nodes. Hia take on the models residing on IC resembles my philosophy of how deeper ties into IC as a layer 2 can be made. That said i think that there are significant technical and SLA related challenges to achieve this in context of IC.

Overall the meeting was quite positive from my perspective. I felt that team has become more confident in dealing with a diverse eco-system as IC. They have their vision and they are making progress on the foundational aspects.

Yes. EMC plan for SNS launched before end of June

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-06-09 01:31:23 UTC | #227

In EMC plan for token distrubution (to be finalize soon), 50% (will remained unchage to final version) of token distribution will be the treasury holding under SNS allocation for reward contribution to EMC network and ecosystem. Generally split under 4 categories: 1. Reward for computing and nodes provider (POW + POA + POC). 2. Reward for ecosystem developers cobuilder. 3. Reward for computing market place trading (including RWA NFT trading). 4. SNS voting reward

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-06-09 02:36:11 UTC | #228

While EMC core developers team is focusing on the protocol optimzation and core of the computing network, we have a new Technical Partner (CTO) joining EMC in Singapore leading the architectural design of decentralize hugging face, with significant part of SNS fund-raise to be focusing on building the globalize developer and engineering team as well as global contributors network. EMC technical partner has exceptional background and experiences as CTO/co-founder of reputable AI start-up (Asia version of DI-D). Despite the aggresive plan (in term of timeline) to launch EMC version of Huggingface in order to support the coming AI heckaton, we are calling for global contributor to join EMC and co-build this platform together. @Icdev2dev we certainly looking for developer like yourself to join us. Regarding the Marriage of ICP and EMC, as disclosed in AMA, we are already working with various IC node provider in Asia to launch large GPU claster (>100xGPU) at Genesis Mainnet launch to provide stable and powerful GPU services to power the decentralize Huggingface. Icarus is very experience in operating hosting services in Oceania, and currently working very closely with me math modelling of cost/efficiency/performance analysis of EMC computing claster, our priority is still optimizing cost by recycling the power GPU from miners.

Has EMC published a demo video? Or can they do so on YouTube/present on the DFINITY Global R&D?

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-06-09 22:04:47 UTC | #231

Hate to say it and bring the whole Army down on me, but EMC is not IC material, YET or STILL !  As much as I love hype and see ICP moon am more concerned for the long term vision, and getting hundreds of thousands of developers and miners from Asia/China join the IC that would seem to pump the price, is not the answer. With all do respect to the official members of Dfinity who push EMC please prove me wrong. Show me code that works on the IC to make a L2 chain be able to sell computing power for AI and settle it on IC and I'll bring mining farms from FLUX, ERGO and others that are not running on RX-470's and single core celeron CPU's (*exaggerated to make a point) and 4 GB of ram on a 2 Mbps connection.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-06-10 01:27:55 UTC | #232

@ZackDS DYOR, just for your reference, a standard domain server for FIL (supermicro 4124 board, AMD EYPD 7542x2, 64Gx 32, 1T M2, 3.84T U2, RTX 3090x8, 25G Ethernet, 2000W x4), this hyperscale cluster is capable of replacing AWS P3/V100 instance for training of AI model (hosted in IDC). Refurbished of piling GPU cards abandoned from Eth miner doesn't means a plug and play, rather require rebuild of server capable to provide optimum GPU compute. All the developmen of EMC code will be open-source as and when our R&D team completed all the require validation in current testnet environment. In current architect design, any transaction that require verifiability will be running on Canister (eg. economic, marketplace), EMC will publish all the detail of Canisters that control EMC network before SNS proposal. Stay tune.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-06-10 01:44:56 UTC | #233

[/quote]

This is great news! As i understand it, it means that anytime a transaction takes place (the unit of work could be different for training versus inference), that transaction would be recorded on IC. 

For example,  i currently use the beta version of leonardo.ai. In this , they give me 150 tokens daily for free to use to generate images based on my prompts. This image generation makes use of some GPU somewhere (such as AWS, GCP, AZURE).They record my usage.

As I understand it, another AI company could use EMC on IC and a user (like me) could use that AI company to generate similar images. The advantage to that AI company is that they get equivalent GPU power at 10-20% of the current cost to leonardo.ai. Did i get that right?

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-06-10 03:04:14 UTC | #235

You are right! The current demo that we have shared with community is like another version of Leonardoai, the SD model was trained with our EMC 8GPU cluster in T3 IDC, trained model (inferences) is deployed and run on decentralized GPU node on EMC testnet, and the UI is currently run on Canister.
We did comparison of cost of refurbished 8x3090 4U vs. on demand pricing of AWS P3 v100 instance @$2.2k/month, operational cost is estimated around 5-10%, the difference is EMC operate thru Computing Marketplace and price will be determined by supply of demand (trade as RWA NFT with ICP, cycles, EMC)

-------------------------

@EMCprotocol 

I'm truly amazed to witness the development of such an ambitious project on the IC platform. The potential it holds to revolutionize the integration of blockchain and AI is truly remarkable. This endeavor has the capability to be a true game changer in the industry.

I wanted to extend my best wishes to the team behind this project.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-06-12 10:50:43 UTC | #237

As of 6.11, EMC has completed the upgrade of all light nodes on the network. The new edge nodes no longer need to synchronize block heights, reducing the burden on the entire network by more than 90%. Currently, there are over 300+ edge nodes and POC is functioning normally. We will continue to monitor the stability of the network. In addition, some Ethereum miners are retrofitting their previous mining machines (upgrading hardware other than GPUs) to establish a cluster of around 100 GPUs. These design plans may become reference models for EMC's future computing power pool.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-06-12 11:34:31 UTC | #238

My messages are lagging behind, and the CTO told me that there are currently 530+ edge nodes.

EMCprotocol | 2023-06-23 08:47:13 UTC | #243

First, we want to thank @Accumulating for the thorough and professional due diligence report. It shows a strong sense of responsibility towards the ICP community and the EMC project. 

Secondly, we appreciate the efforts and ongoing communication from @Accumulating.icp , @Icdev2dev and @icarus . EMC team is eager and open to share EMC’s technology, business model, tokenology, and global market expansion with ICP community. We have also received valuable feedback and suggestions.

Lastly, EMC will continuously improve the GPU computing power network and develop EMC Hub (a marketplace for computing power and AI models). Base on EMC Hub, we will organize AI+Web3 hackathons to bring massive users into the IC community and Web3 through AI applications.

The " Proposal to create an SNS-DAO for EMC" is live. https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123794

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-07-31 09:05:36 UTC | #246

```
52%: Reserved for Ecosystem Rewards, under control of the EMC DAO

10%: To be distributed by the NNS run decentralization sale which includes the Community Fund

6%: To be reserved for subsequent decentralized sale, exclude Community Fund

15%: Allocated to the EMC Developer Team

2%: Allocated to the advisors, early supporters of EMC and Airdrops

15%: Reserved for the EMC Foundation
```
Seems to me like the EMC foundation + EMC Developer Team have full control of the DAO and in essence all the money in the Treasury (Ecosystem Rewards). Am I wrong? Why not make it so that the community is the one in control of the DAO?

So yeah, basically SNS investor can get a ratio 3 times better than pre-sale investors.

And we are supposed to trust them that afterwards they will give an unknown amount of token during the exchange DIP20 --> ICP standards.

Of course the leader want to decide that after the SNS as if the decision will be his anymore.

Do you trust people handling early investor like this ? If you invest in it you might be handled the same way.

hey @dominicwilliams  is this how SNS DAO works ?

Pre-sale investor will have 10% more for the risk of never getting their token after the SNS with trust-me bro security.
Besides its just about locked ICP reward.

So why exactly did people invest in the pre-sale ?

-------------------------

wavecoffeecakey | 2023-07-31 13:51:21 UTC | #254

Hi could you share your SNS config and tokenomics spreadsheet? I did not see one. 

Also your github is empty for a project that is requesting millions from the community. What exactly is being decentralized as part of your SNS launch?

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-07-31 14:25:38 UTC | #255

I rejected this proposal for the following reasons:

- I did not see a clear identification of a market or customer

- The Github repository was empty

- It was unclear to me who the team was.

I feel that this SNS proposal should not pass until:

- a preliminary business plan has been submitted

- We see the code

- The team is made public

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-07-31 14:34:55 UTC | #256

I will add that what EMC claims to be building is incredibly complex. For this proposal to pass the community should demand ample evidence that they are able to deliver. 

The notion of collaborating with an open-source community to construct a peer-to-peer computing infrastructure is unrealistic and as such is a red flag.

There are too many buzzwords in the proposal to take this project seriously. 

EMC may be a legitimate project - effective communication is difficult and a second attempt may improve on the shortcomings of this proposal. I'm not saying EMC is a scam. However, no intelligent investor would back the proposal as presented.

As comparable Web2 model - Civitai.com already has 4.5m MAU. EMC provide SDK for developer to build AI DApp which can provide service to End-user.

@anon98653474 EMC presales was targeted for investor to invest in EMC and staking into EMC testnet validator node and routing node. We have over 7.4M EMC staking on testnet https://dashboard.edgematrix.pro/#/home. Investor has start to earn testnet staking reward for their investment in EMC. Presales token is for testnet, it was planned for testnet token (DIP20) swap with ICRC-1 (SNS token) after the SNS. The final ratio of swap can only be defined after the ICP/EMC swap ratio is finalised. Current proposal is to enable the SWAP of testnet token (as it original presale swap of 1 ICP:110 EMC) to calculate the final SWAP ratio to ICRC-1 token, and this will also include all the reward token that investor received + 10% more to presales investment.

You have some old java code, that looks like a proof of concept and no functional Motoko code. Again what exactly are you decentralizing, what does the community have control of when you are not a functional dApp?

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-07-31 17:02:32 UTC | #267

Pardon me, I wrote that very quickly because I saw the proposal appear and didn't like the way it was presented. Given we only have a short time to respond to proposals that was very spontaneous. 

- I was looking at the white paper before. I see the team page now. 

- When I wrote that the github was empty it was the lack of activity I noticed I see there is code there.

So all readers should disregard the above perspective.

However, I would like to see more work on the size of market and ideally indication of some market feedback to the product before investing

Is all our code invisible?
We have 9 libraries, code for java, go, motoko, and we have open sourced the node code for EMC network, and ETH isn't a functional dapp, doesn't it make sense?
EMC is supposed to be infra, EMC hub is an application based market, every E value displayed on a dashboard requires hardware input from  GPU, is it hasty to say that before you understand it clearly, is the purpose of decentralization to be able to make irresponsible and arbitrary conclusions?

This is certainly the most exciting product on ICP that was announced this year and one that could seriously boost the ecosystem as a whole to the next level. I'm not sure where the uncertainty is coming from since there's enough transparency here to make the validity of this dapp clear if we're using prior successful SNS sales as a metric. I do maintain some doubts about the numbers that the developers are claiming they can reach (in the time period they're claiming), but it's not enough to deter me from approving this sale.

ninadou | 2023-08-01 03:35:00 UTC | #270

Thanks for your appreciation! And we would like to express our gratitude to the early supporters of EMC! 

EMC has 13 repositories now, including Java, Motoko, JS, Vue, and Go. It comprises computing protocols, SDK, and model platforms. The registered computing nodes have exceeded 18,000, with over 2,000 active nodes. 

EMC Hub already hosts dozens of AI models (checkpoints, Lora), and we are integrating FIL's Titan storage. Due to EMC's AI partners and community preparing to upload thousands of models on the EMC Hub, a significant amount of storage is required. The goal is to become the largest decentralized hugging face and civitai. 

Nothing can stop an excellent project from marching towards a valuable and promising direction. :slightly_smiling_face:

**6 Reasons to support this proposal:**

1. Granting ICP with AI capabilities is a crucial opportunity for the future development of InternetComputer. This aspect is of utmost importance, without a doubt. As mentioned in a recent tweet by Dom, the "AI Compute unit" specifically refers to EMC
![image|385x500](upload://z1nBzKgmVuz61dt1Db3Q4Us7Uvg.jpeg)

2. The core members of EMC team are experienced industry professionals, and most importantly, they are resilient individuals with ambitious goals. In the past month, their diligent and fruitful work in engineering implementation showcases their strong capabilities and dedication
![image|690x399](upload://2GshvsO8pcWyjxqpdWzaQkG0yt6.jpeg)

3. EMC serving as ICP's Layer2 and comprising both SW/HW elements. Its complexity and difficulty are unmatched by other SNS projects. In the current testnet,  over 18,000 nodes and a total compute power of 2803E, demonstrating significant scale and decentralization achieved.
![image|690x255](upload://jZibKhWlTyKXVDabxnRixeyZ6Zb.jpeg)

4.EMC's primary codes have already been open-sourced, including POC, AI, and EMC hub. Although these codes have not undergone auditing, it's worth noting that other SNS projects haven't undergone audits either (please correct me if I'm wrong).
![image|690x358](upload://c423YWaOyCOHhZQY7jF4rsv7tyv.jpeg)

5. Regarding the economic model, EMC team's token allocation of 15% falls within a reasonable range, and the voting weight is only 0.5. This ensures that after SNS sales, the community's voting power exceeds 50%, reaching 54.5%.
![image|690x392](upload://vAMjJ8MJQSNcmd7xCo5S9xXaIyc.jpeg)

6. The EMC token price during the SNS round is significantly lower than the presale round, indicating that the project team has made significant concessions for the smooth sale of SNS. Moreover, they have implemented a reasonable token compensation policy to compensate presale round participants, highlighting EMC's commitment to its early supporters.

Big thanks to those who tuned into the EMC Twitter Space today! 

Tonight's AMA is very exciting. Alex and Zed discussed the following topics:

1. whether the EMC-DAO proposal meets the standard with SNS
2. how DIP20 token can be exchanged for main network token ICRC-1
3. EMC business model and market expansion
4. EMC technical architecture (computing power, model, data fully onchain, and RWA and computing power financial derivatives), this section is very  excellent, don't miss it

Honest question for the EMC team. @EMCprotocol @zed.emc @ninadou 

Which projects (by name) are using the EMC protocol? 3-part question, please see below.

a. Which ICP projects are using the EMC protocol right now?
b. Which blockchain projects on other chains (not ICP) are using the EMC protocol right now?
c. Which non-blockchain projects are using EMC?

My question refers to apps that have live integrations with code running integrated with EMC right now, not those with plans or in the process of doing so.

Antony | 2023-08-01 18:07:34 UTC | #278

EMC team, I love everything that you say, however, I would like to bring to your attention that your profile seems to convey a different message. I couldn't help but notice that your Twitter spaces had impressive participation of 10.9K individuals. That is correct **10,900** users tuned in. 
While Dfinity only had 200 users. This is quite noteworthy. There are only two reason 
1. You are buying users just like everything else
2. Dfinity's marketing sucks and they need to hire yours. 

Which is correct?

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-02 03:24:54 UTC | #279

You are all wrong, please go to Twitter and look at the previous AMA, there are dfinity members participating, there are project parties participating on ICP, as long as twitter space is not malfunctioning (thanks Musk), many of them are more than 1W audience, ICP Chinese community complains all day long that EMC doesn't know how to market, and European and American community says EMC only knows how to market! When did people start jumping to negative conclusions about things that are beyond their cognitive boundaries?EMC went live from 5.10 and now has over 18,000+ nodes and 2,000+ POC nodes in only 3 months, are they also purchasing users? And spread across 20+ countries, this marketing expense has probably exceeded the amount of money raised for SNS, so the EMC team are fools for going to such lengths that telegram, discord, twitter have so many users.
And I think you're focusing on the wrong direction, instead of questioning that it's a marketing ploy, why don't you reflect on why Dfinity doesn't spend more time on running the users, there are only a few of us on the EMC operations team, yet all of us are there whenever there's a problem in the community.

And yet you are not covered by Messari, The Block, Coin telegraph, Coinmarkercap. You do know the numbers are crazy. 

18K nodes
2000+ POC nodes

Why are you not raising funds via institutional investors? 

With the numbers, isn't it easy to go to any investors and they will put few millions on your table. Why sacrificing tokens at low valuation and raise tiny amount of fund.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-08-02 04:17:16 UTC | #281

What follows is Not legal nor financial advice. Dyor. But this is my impression of EMC; having interacted with the EMC team. 

I really think that they believe in the vision of decentralized GPU compute. Having lurked around in their Telegram as well as having talked to one of the potential user in SF (in a code and state meetup), they have GROWN to the level that they have because of the excitement that they have created. Is that a bad thing? I think not. Growth should be respected,  IMO.

The model is quite simple really. Reuse the GPUs for GenAI work that then gets paid for in the secondary market by GenAI derivative work. 

Is their git up to stuff. The last time i checked, no. But that is not the point. EMC is ALL infra. It's like saying OpenAi's sole business model is to complete conversations with simple API. I would really urge the readers to go through the implications of EMC as a layer 2 to ICP.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2023-08-02 04:45:55 UTC | #282

I believe there is a misguided notion within the IC community, compare with other SNS project:

if your goals are ambitious, then high standards are expected; 
if your goals are modest, people tend not to be too demanding. 

It's a strange phenomenon where lofty goals become limiting factors. 

Please carefully consider whether MeMe Coin can drive an explosive growth in the IC ecosystem or if a direct integration of AI and IC is more likely. 

EMC is not just a simple software app; it's an ecosystem involving software, hardware, and comprehensive capabilities in global resource integration.

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-08-02 06:50:08 UTC | #283

Sorry I can't accept your perspective.

Why aren't the same standards applied to projects that have already been approved by SNS-DAO? 

Besides, EMC has received invitations for listings from several exchanges and wallet, without their prior experience with ICP's DIP20 or ICRC-1, they need to research the technology and development of ICP. EMC miners come from the ETH and FIL communities, and they have registered IC wallets (mostly Plug and Me) because of EMC. We are helping to promote wider adoption of ICP.. 


Furthermore, EMC has many collaboration opportunities with various Web3 ecosystem projects, and signed MOUs with significant MCNs. Our participation in WebX in Japan and media coverage highlights EMC's collaborative plans in the computing power index. 
https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2023-07-30/ceex-exchange-grandly-launches-global-ai-computing-power-index-at-tokyo-webx-conference

![image|690x127](upload://spAChgaL3d6zY6YPJyXpHbpwj0S.png)

If EMC is rejected due to outstanding performance, it indicates a lack of clarity in SNS's criteria. **This standard should be fair to all projects participating in SNS.**

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2023-08-02 10:19:59 UTC | #284

Yes, the discussion here has nothing to do with financial advice. It's about whether SNS should measure projects against a unified standard. 

If you don't believe in EMC, you are free not to invest a penny in the subsequent SNS Launchpad. However, if EMC indeed meets the unified standard set by SNS, I believe everyone should vote "Yes".

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-02 10:20:58 UTC | #285

EMC doesn't have an official token yet, why would Messari, The Block, Coin telegraph, Coinmarkercap cover it? Is it all unreasonable not to be in your assessed value system?
How do you know that no VCs are interested in EMC, as the CEO of EMC, I can say here in charge that there are at least 6 reputable VCs in contact with the EMC team at the moment, even including ICP's own investment organization. The share reserved for VCs in the whitepaper is only 6% because we believe web3 projects are more deserving of fundraising through a decentralized approach. Let me tell you where the biggest disruptions came from. 2 organizations were concerned about the lack of liquidity of ICPs, and the fact that EMCs being tied to ICPs could lead to exit problems in the future. One organization was unhappy that 6% was too little. But so far, no VCs are unhappy with the external valuation of EMC, which is well above the SNS fundraising cap. Why SNS's valuation is so low, please go and understand the mechanism of SNS before asking this question.

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-08-02 14:09:04 UTC | #286

None of these platforms need a token to analyze your project. Give us one credible document or article from a prestigious firm to support your claims. Everything this team touches looks like a big dark pool mess to me. 

You don't need SNS. How you are hyping up EMC looks like you are doing a favor to ICP. I would wait before I vote YES for your project. If you are still here after six months, let's come back and look at the updates/review. 

I vote **NO**, and I urge everyone to **VOTE NO** on this proposal because it's too early and things are all over the place.

-------------------------

aakh1361 | 2023-08-02 14:36:44 UTC | #287

I voted yes

It's really strange for me that early projects like Boom Dao or Ghust coin meme get positive votes

But a project like EMC, which has tens of thousands of lines of code written for it, gets downvoted

Why they easily get a yes vote, but EMC is faced with strict treatment

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-08-04 17:22:49 UTC | #288

Hugging Face – The AI community building the future.
This is what the IC needs.

zed.emc | 2023-08-04 10:56:34 UTC | #289

It seems to me that you are already assuming that EMC is guilty first, and then we have to produce evidence to prove our innocence. Is that correct and fair?
We will  prove the value of EMC, not for you, but for ourselves and the supporters of EMC, and if you're still here in 6 months, maybe you'll change your mind about us.

icarus | 2023-08-04 14:13:55 UTC | #290

This thread is now 10 weeks old and 270+ posts long. I recommend reading the first post again ( and no more than the first 25 ) to revisit the reasons the EMC team gave for proposing an SNS launch for their project.

Over the past two months the EMC team has put a lot of effort into addressing the concerns and scepticism raised here about whether their project is appropriate and ready for an SNS decentralization launch. They have promoted and grown their distributed GPU node testnet from hundreds to thousands of machines, lanched a dashboard dapp showing the distribution and compute capacity of those nodes, launched a functional MVP UI dapp for utilising the testnet for running AIGC models, successfully sold limited release novel NFT collections for GPU compute time and AIGC model assets on YUMI marketplace, established business partner relationships with infrastructure & developer & marketing & AI user organisations, released and open-sourced their various code bases, held Twitter Spaces AMA sessions at least weekly with english-chinese live translation to involve both language communities and inform everyone about who they are and what they are aiming to achieve.

Despite all of this there are some in this forum and the IC community who remain sceptical about EMC; and that's ok. Not everyone is convinced that each project on the SNS launch list has earned their support.

What I would ask of anyone still undecided about this SNS is to remember that EMC is a full-stack decentralized GPU "cloud" infrastructure project hoping to compete with several highly centralised GPU cloud services controlled by single corporate entities. These companies deploy many millions of dollars to purchase and deploy the thousands of GPU hardware nodes they need, typically with massive amounts of VC money.

The EMC project team has a couple of "secret weapons" that will give them a good shot at achieving this aim: 
1) the Internet Computer platform they chose to build upon, because it makes their infrastructure network services and developer application layer natively and fully decentralised; and
2) an SNS DAO to fund, govern and manage the EMC software and network services, around which they hope to build a community of users, developers, engineers and independent businesses.

Why would all this be worth the effort? Because distributed computation and sovereign information for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-resourced, is a worthy goal. This is what I think the ICP and EMC projects and communities have in common and why this EMC project deserves the support of the IC community.

icpalist | 2023-08-04 18:36:48 UTC | #291

> But a project like EMC, which has tens of thousands of lines of code written for it, gets downvoted

If only those "thousands of lines of code" were written by the EMC team itself. 

All references to "**github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge**" were stripped from the emc_node repository at "**github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/emc_node**".

There's no mention of the original authors (**Polygon Labs**) or that the emc_node repository is a fork.

That repository alone accounts for most of those "thousands of lines of code".

The original project (polygon-edge) was released under a permissive license (Apache 2.0), but let's at least give credit where it's due.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2023-08-04 17:58:54 UTC | #292

Dear Community Members,

After a comprehensive review, DFINITY has decided not to support the current proposal. Our decision stems from various inconsistencies, discrepancies, and concerns that we believe are essential to address:

1. **No Canisters under SNS Control**:There are no canisters currently under SNS control. The call to `list_sns_canisters` on the [SNS root canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/55uwu-byaaa-aaaaq-aaa7q-cai) returns an empty list, contrary to expectations. This means there is no value assigned to the DAO that goes beyond a “promise”.

2. **Discrepancy in Tokenomics Sheet and SNS Initialization Parameters**: There are mismatches between the [proposed tokenomics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XoiN1EEVW-iZLNyuN6_5WSuiC7AvqWaBwyvha1utyAc/edit#gid=528459868) and the actual SNS initialization parameters. 
- The tokenomics sheet states the the `proposal_reject_cost` is `100` tokens, but when calling `get_nervous_system_parameters` on the [SNS governance canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/wdcek-2qaaa-aaaaq-aabaa-cai), the `reject_cost_e8s` is `5_000_000_000`, so `50` tokens. This can also be seen on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/55uwu-byaaa-aaaaq-aaa7q-cai)
- The tokenomics sheet states the `neuron_miniumum_stake` is `10` tokens, but when calling `get_nervous_system_parameters` on the [SNS governance canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/wdcek-2qaaa-aaaaq-aabaa-cai), the `neuron_minimum_stake_e8s` is `100_000_000`, so `1` token. This can also be seen on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/55uwu-byaaa-aaaaq-aaa7q-cai)


3. **Discrepancy in Tokenomics Sheet and proposal payload**: There are mismatches between the [proposed tokenomics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XoiN1EEVW-iZLNyuN6_5WSuiC7AvqWaBwyvha1utyAc/edit#gid=528459868) and the actual proposal [payload](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123794?p=3&t=26).
The tokenomics sheet states the `max_participant_icp` is `100` tokens, but when checking the [proposal payload](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123794?p=3&t=26) the `max_participant_icp_e8s` is `15000000000000`, so `150` tokens. 

4. **Contradiction in Reward Rate**: The current proposal text, the governance canister and the tokenomics sheet provide different reward rates. The current proposal text states the following:


   > Voting Rewards: The reward rate will start from 2% annually. This rate would decline over time and settle at total 5% over 10 years.

   In the [tokenomics sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XoiN1EEVW-iZLNyuN6_5WSuiC7AvqWaBwyvha1utyAc/edit#gid=0&range=A9) the reward rate is constant at 2.5%. 

   When calling `get_nervous_system_parameters` on the [SNS governance canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/wdcek-2qaaa-aaaaq-aabaa-cai), the `final_reward_rate_basis_points` and `initial_reward_rate_basis_points` are `0` respectively, indicating that there are no voting rewards at all. This can also be seen on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/55uwu-byaaa-aaaaq-aaa7q-cai)


5. **Dissolved Neuron Owning 10% of Tokens**: There is a [neuron](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/55uwu-byaaa-aaaaq-aaa7q-cai/neuron/798c466aad1e39d1c7009dbd79bacbe30c2fc109dfeb2ce8512e0600726f12ad) that is part of the `airdrop_neurons` and has `0` dissolve delay and no vesting that owns ~10% of all tokens (owner `r5jfq-5ofkq-xg2fn-7osp7-lul5j-nnoqo-juxba-2mdmh-ezqhf-sbvo7-uae`). This is in conflict with the information provided in the proposal and the tokenomics sheet.


In addition, although this did not factor in our decision for now, we would strongly recommend every project to adhere to a max of 10% from the Neuron Fund. This has been recommended in the guidelines and although DFINITY hasn’t yet rejected any proposal due to this factor,  we would start doing that in the future. At this time EMC requested for 11% the proposal submission, which does not align with the suggested [minimum standards for neuron fund contribution](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543#suggested-minimum-standards-4).

Please note that NF is for the community and if teams start overdrawing then the Neuron Fund contributors may find it difficult to support future teams. Hence we strongly recommend you to restrict your ask to max 10%. Additionally it is our recommendation that the Neuron Fund should ideally be 1/3 or at most 1/2 of the minimal ICP to be raised. 


The noted inconsistencies compel us to urge for further clarification and review of the proposal.

We are open to discussions and collaboration to address these concerns and ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the entire community.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Does this mean Dfinity will reject every proposal that's on the move? Project like Seers are asking for 30% I guess. Same goes with BoomDAO

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-08-04 20:50:07 UTC | #294

Before submitting the proposal on SNS, the EMC team had tried to communicate with Dfinity through Slack and sharing the tokenomic configuration file to more than 10 Dfinity team members, but didn’t receive any replies or technical support. EMC team had to rely on KINIC and hotornot’s code for reference. EMC tokenomic has much more complex parameters.

During the early communication with Dfinity, Dom has suggested EMC to establish a foundation, which the team did. However, SNS as a new product has it’s limitation, the tokenomic parameters were divided into three parts: treasury, team, and airdrop. The treasury was meant for issuing EMC ecosystem rewards, and SNS required that the team’s share couldn’t exceed swap. EMC has to use airdrops parameter to hold EMC Foundation’s share which result in the mismatch of configuration vs tokenomic file template on Airdrop parameter.

The proposal has been submitted for four days, giving Dfinity enough time to communicate with the EMC team if there were any issues with the parameters. However, it seems that the rejection vote happened within the last three hours of the voting period when the community had already voted 19.3% yes and 12% no, leading to a veto (30% no) well showcasing of decentralized governance.

EMC has confirm the guidance of 10% CF limit of mature neuron fund and adjusted the proposal to match 10% and verify the mature neuron fund pool, which was $4,080,000+(408,000 corresponding to 10%), and it complied with the rules at the time of the proposal submission. Any changes in the CF quota during the voting period were beyond EMC’s prediction range, and once a proposal is submitted, it cannot be modified.
![WechatIMG223|199x500](upload://siPCny4NNjphm0uZdkX1O70UCZn.jpeg)

On the other hand, catalyze had submitted with 400K corresponding to 12% of mature neuron fund, but during the voting period, they accurately predicted the increase in the mature neuron fund of over 4m, leading to a reduction of CF from 12% to 10%, which seemed quite remarkable.

All EMC canister has been transferred to the EMC SNS Governance canister, it is a mistake on transferring instead of to SNS Root Canister. Once transfer EMC team has no right to recall the transfer.

1. **No Canisters under SNS Control**:There are no canisters currently under SNS control. The call to `list_sns_canisters` on the [SNS root canister ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/55uwu-byaaa-aaaaq-aaa7q-cai) returns an empty list, contrary to expectations. This means there is no value assigned to the DAO that goes beyond a “promise”.

Regarding the error and mismatch of parameters, Before submitting the proposal on SNS, the EMC team had tried to communicate with DFINITY team through Slack and sharing the tokenomic configuration file to more than 10 DFINITY team members, but didn’t receive any replies or technical support. EMC team had to rely on KINIC and hotornot’s code for reference. EMC tokenomic has much more complex parameters, and due to various version of parameter before final submission, EMC team had made some errors in filling the parameters 2,3,4. 

2. **Discrepancy in Tokenomics Sheet and SNS Initialization Parameters**: There are mismatches between the [proposed tokenomics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XoiN1EEVW-iZLNyuN6_5WSuiC7AvqWaBwyvha1utyAc/edit#gid=528459868) and the actual SNS initialization parameters.

# Great Job Dfinity 

# To EMC team. Please work on your product and come back with more progress after six months. We will be still here.

Weird, the Catalyze required 40w icp for Community Fund just a few days ago, and you didnt say No.

Sormarler | 2023-08-05 00:30:32 UTC | #298

I voted for this but I don't have any problem with the foundation rejecting the proposal for the reasons cited. Time to go back to the drawing board and try again.

@cryptoschindler This is the root cause, why Dfinity reject to communicate with EMC team, but reject them at the end of SNS proposal?  

**The role of Dfinity should be a supporter and leader of the ICP ecosystem, rather than acting as a judge.**

Please find the attached of CF contribution that was adjusted to 10% at the time of EMC SNS proposal submission.

In addition, although this did not factor in our decision for now, we would strongly recommend every project to adhere to a max of 10% from the Neuron Fund. This has been recommended in the guidelines and although DFINITY hasn’t yet rejected any proposal due to this factor, we would start doing that in the future. At this time EMC requested for 11% the proposal submission, which does not align with the suggested [minimum standards for neuron fund contribution](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543#suggested-minimum-standards-4).
[/quote]


They didn’t factor it in their decision as stated above.

And unrelated to your comment;

Catalyze did have the sns setup as communicated to the community.

Blaming dfinity to “not hold your hand” for not responding when you want to is wrong in every way. 

I setup the catalyze SNS and when dfinity didn’t have the answers / wasn’t responding fast enough, I reached out to the HoN and OC developers, created forum posts, did testing through the sns-testing repo to check behaviour, etc.

zed.emc | 2023-08-05 06:21:59 UTC | #303

You dodged the 12% question nicely.

zed.emc | 2023-08-05 06:44:54 UTC | #304

The whole point of decentralization is to reduce the cost of trust, and I look forward to communicating openly with you:
1. What exactly do you mean by you don't like the way EMC is presented, and what can we do to improve it?
2.EMC has signed some business cooperation MOU in May, and also invited the partners to participate in the AMA together, elaborating on the cooperation between the two sides and the profit model, I know it is not possible for everyone to go to the AMA recordings to listen to all the time, but for a project to vote, do some work to understand it beforehand, which is the meaning of participation in the governance, otherwise why do we need to go to the centralized governance?

It appears DFINITY are very careful not to preempt IC community review and discussion of SNS proposals.

To be clear, it is the EMC team's responsibility to ensure the SNS DAO configuration is correct and consistent with their IC NNS proposal description and tokenomics worksheet. 

The EMC project team have since committed to correcting the inconsistencies identified by DFINITY team and then resubmitting their SNS proposal

Nothing to dodge, it’s public data. Eventually it was a risk that we were willing to take. 

If the community didn’t like what we requested from the neuron fund they would have voted it down. And we already had most “yes” votes without the one from the dfinity foundation 🙂

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2023-08-05 07:32:17 UTC | #307

We are having these discussions not to argue about who is right or wrong, but to improve the entire process, making it easier and clearer for future project teams to understand key indicators and aspects, rather than feeling overwhelmed and uncertain throughout the process. Here, I lean more towards DFINITY playing a crucial role, rather than merely being a high and mighty judge.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-05 07:32:55 UTC | #308

It is the responsibility of the EMC team for not fully understanding the parameters of the SNS, which led to an error in filling it out, and we will carefully check to make sure we don't make a mistake on the next submission.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-05 07:42:18 UTC | #309

I still don't understand what is being decentralized. Seems like it is more about raising funds than anything else. Correct me if I am wrong but the keys to the routing GPU network is still on the machines of EMC? 

Also there should be a clear form that we can read as the community that follows guidelines set by Dfinity. Making up rules as we go is great but they should be part of some form teams fill out and then is shared with everyone in the community. I understand standards change but they should be public and maybe even approved by the community when changes are made to that form/guidelines for SNS so we have a clear history to changes.

zed.emc | 2023-08-05 10:13:53 UTC | #310

The EMC network is a very complex system with multiple players involved, the GPU provider (miner) owns the ownership of the GPUs, and of course the private keys of the GPU network nodes, each POC verification requires a private key signature, so the private key is encrypted and stored on the node. Miners first need to register the nodes to the EMC network, this is done through the ICP wallet, so for miners, the node private key and the wallet private key are two things. Users who need to subscribe to node arithmetic or buy a model at the EMC hub also need the ICP wallet signature, so why is this not decentralized?

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-05 10:24:18 UTC | #311

EMC has long made all the information public, white papers, economic systems, open source code, dashboard, model libraries, demos, test arithmetic, roadmap, and even commercial progress (AMA), you can see everything when you enter from the [edgematrix.pro](https://edgematrix.pro/), so why is it always criticized for not being transparent? Is it our responsibility not to see it? Then you can also go to twitter and listen to the AMA recordings many times before, the information is all there, but people don't read it and only write subjective judgments on the forum.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-05 10:35:01 UTC | #312

Why not have an audit if this is true? I mean you expect investors, many of which are not technical, and even if technical to spend their time reviewing code? If you do say that you hold no keys I would like an audit to be done to see if that is indeed the case. And the expectation to have everyone review code in languages that they might or might not know is not reasonable. At the same time I think this is a problem with all projects. However, this one is even more complex since the network is a mix between your own and ICP.

This isn't an issue with your project. I would expect some process to happen within ICP to really not fly blind as more projects SNS.

I would also like the network to have a social eng white hack to see if someone can get enough social credit to SNS with minimal effort. I don't think that has been done. However, social hacks are the most popular among hackers since humans don't like conflict. I mean didn't the FTX guy rug pull billions among investors. I mean there has been many more on ETH and such but it does show that social eng hacks are very common. Not saying you are that but would be nice if we had some mech of defense against it.

Congratulations (genuinely) for getting it right first time and for finding help from independent teams with prior experience successfully launching an SNS.

But remember who assisted the OpenChat team with their their SNS launch proposals? IIRC the DFINITY team were closely involved helping them launch as there were no prior projects with experience of doing an SNS (except SNS-1 which was DFINITY... doing it for themselves... standing on their own two feet...etc). Maybe EMC should have reached out to other successful project teams for advice and support rather than to DFINITY but that hardly seems clear in advance.

I understand why DFINITY team members and the foundation itself doesn't contribute to these SNS discussions or help behind the scenes even though they are a major contributor to the IC. They are damned-if-they-do and damned-if-they-dont because their genuine intentions are too often misreprented by unsupported accusations of favouritism or ill-intent.
But that doesn't make their silence golden. The wider IC community and these SNS discussions in particular are the poorer for their absence.

In place of their interaction during the SNS process (until near the end) we need three things (at least):
1. Clear and consistent guidance about the parameters and purpose of the SNS DAO for projects, provided unambiguously and in-advance;
2. Community support and goodwill towards projects in the *process* of an SNS launch, even while critique and hard questions are asked and answers are expected;
3. Shared responsibility for the future of the Internet Computer ecosystem and it's public reputation as a robust and welcoming community where teams and individuals supported if they share our common purpose.

To be clear I am not saying these things don't exist, I see a lot of it in the genuine questions asked, challenges made and answers given and effort put into deep-dive project analyses. But there is also a lot of ego-contests, watch-you-sink-or-swim, point-and-cry-scam, prove-it-to-me-or-else, my-idea-is-better-than-your-idea and many other destructive attitudes on display here, in public.

And I am not asking us to hold hands and sing Kumbaya. The tough questions and expectations of high standards on code and operations for SNS proposals are really important. The Internet Computer is a young platform and ecosystem with huge ambitions and goals to be achieved. The self-selected people and projects who are here now and soon will be the core of it's future success. But that success is not guaranteed and frankly may be in the balance unless we work together and support each other while also keeping each other honest and setting high standards of operations and behaviour.

If we want to be the best worldwide decentralised public digital economy then we will have to work better together in public than the incumbent centralised platforms do, who hide their politics and power-plays behind polished corporate walls. And if we are handicapped by the absence of DFINITY team members being unable to freely engage in these critical discussions because of *our* internal politics and lack of shared purpose, well that makes the goal a whole lot harder to achieve.

We've consulted with a number of auditing firms before, and they usually prefer to service code for EVM architectures, and only one was willing to quote up to tens of thousands of dollars for smart contracts for IC. At this stage, we are updating the code every day, it's not economical to go for auditing, and the biggest role of auditing is for DEX, Defi type of security defense, EMC is focusing on AI applications, auditing doesn't help the community to know whether EMC is working or not, the best way to do it is to go and run a node and plug in the AI model and run it for a little while, which is not that hard.

What I would ask of anyone still undecided about this SNS is to remember that EMC is a full-stack decentralized GPU “cloud” infrastructure project hoping to compete with several highly centralised GPU cloud services controlled by single corporate entities. These companies deploy many millions of dollars to purchase and deploy the thousands of GPU hardware nodes they need, typically with massive amounts of VC money.

So EMC is basically a decentralized version of GPU hosting companies like CoreWeave/Applied Digital Corporation?

Why rush toward another proposal? Your project failed the proposal, and you should go back to the board and build and come back. Maybe the sentiments will change. It looks like you are rushing, and it almost looks like your project will fail without SNS. 

If SNS is the only way for you to become successful, I doubt your future. Underestimating the strength of a community can be a mistake. Do the proposal after 6 months with more progress on your project. If it's that much advanced and once in a life time opportunity, we will be here to invest. It looks like now you are just rushing towards $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
