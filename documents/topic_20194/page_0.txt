EMC is preparing to launch its SNS DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale expected soon.
This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the EMC SNS and ask the founding team any questions.
 
 
**About EMC**
EMC is a decentralized Layer-2 computing power network built on IC (Internet Computer) with the goal of becoming a new entrance to Web3 in the AI era.
Based on decentralized computing power network and computing power trading market, it connects decentralized AI applications with decentralized computing power conveniently, efficiently and at low cost.
With the rapid growth of AI, it makes the large-scale and practical adoption of Web3 possible, and helps people enter the AI era more fairly through Web3 and seize the opportunity of the era.
EMC is a project of Web3 empowered with new AI technology, which is significantly different from traditional blockchain projects, representing the combination of web3 native and innovation, representing new trends and attention, with extraordinary vitality and sustainability.
 
**Market Opportunities**
The market which EMC is facing, one is the POW computing power market with wide consensus, and another is rapidly growing demand for AI computing power.
On the computing power supply side, the past 10 years have proven that the fairness and incentivization of the POW mechanism enables the rapid and unbiased aggregation of massive computing power resources. And this mechanism's effectiveness has been proven repeatedly.
In the AI era, the original most criticized empty energy consumption will become a productive resource that actually generates value because aggregated computing power can be efficiently connected to AI applications.
In Web3, previously criticized energy consumption, which was considered wasteful, will transform into a productive resource of real and useful value. This is made possible as aggregated computing power can be effectively linked to AI applications. Therefore, many idle Etheruem, Filecoin or other mining machines will be able to be reused to generate useful value.
On the computing power demand side, global AI computing power usage has doubled every 3.43 months on average over the past 10 years, and will grow 500 times by 2030 as AI applications explode since 2023.
The combination of computing power and AI applications will be one of the few growth points and huge opportunities in the depressed global economy.
The promising synergy between AI and web3 has only just begun. The native narrative of web3 has always been slightly hollow: only tokens cannot bring the next generation of the Internet.
However, the combined transformative power of AI and Web3 makes it possible to finally realize the vision of Web3, which will empower users and builders to change their destiny in unprecedented ways.
The intersection of AI and web3 is a dynamic, rapidly evolving new frontier with tremendous potential for growth and innovation. This offers a wealth of opportunities for developers and investors.
This is an exciting time to be at the forefront of these cutting-edge technologies. This is the iPhone moment for web3 & AI!
 
**EMC's Unique Value**
EMC is a project that will have a huge impact in the future because it creates many unique values!
 
•     	**New Narrative:**
￮   	The first advantage of EMC , which is different from traditional blockchain, comes from IC. The unique value of ICP should belong to the AI era. When we choose to combine AI with Web3, it becomes difficult for other public chains to meet the demands. There is no choice but ICP.
￮   	EMC as the Layer-2 of ICP connects decentralized AI applications and decentralized computing power, which has differentiation and uniqueness in the crypto world with stories of homogeneity, repetition and excessive financialization.
￮   	EMC's mechanism is based on POW, aggregating not only AI computing power, but more importantly AI applications and users through computing power. Web3 empowers AI, and AI generates new business models for web3, which is a wealth creation narrative that will last for years.

•     	**New traffic (liquidity):**
￮   	The current situation of Web3 has proven that simply attracting participants by excessive financialization has hit the ceiling, and the earliest highly speculative players have become bored with the stock game, and there is little innovation in the industry.
￮   	All existing Web3 applications or scenarios are not capable of acquiring new users anymore, and the bull market will not arise out of thin air. While AI applications can gather more than 100 million users in a few months and continue to grow rapidly with strong willingness of users to pay.
￮   	EMC has the ability to become a super aggregator of AI applications, bringing users who use decentralized AI applications or tools empowered by Web3, and is a new entrance for massive AI users to enter the Web3 world easily.

•     	**New assets:**
￮   	The development of Web3 in the last 14 years is essentially the development of asset types, and each round of innovation has to discover new forms of assets.
￮   	EMC creatively digitalizes computing power resources into assets, bringing new tradable real assets to Web3.
￮   	EMC uses edge nodes of the P2P network to intelligently schedule node computing power and task allocation through routing algorithms, expanding performance and efficiency for AI applications and model training.
￮   	EMC efficiently improves the performance of decentralized networks for real-world applications. The process of mining can run various AIGC applications as well as provide computing power for model training, which lays a value base for practical mining, which is PoUW (Proof of Useful Work).
￮   	For developers or users, the computing power on the EMC network can generate a special NFT by subscribing to a smart contract, which is called "Computing Power Socket". Users can plug and play through the computing power socket or trade it as a commodity, which will bring a new digital asset to blockchain.
￮   	By trading computing power on the market, miners can not only get mining rewards, but also additional income from computing power usage, which makes EMC mining more flexible and scalable. In the computing power trading market, the "Computing Power Socket" will greatly enrich the number of tradable assets in the form of equity NFT and NFT derivatives.
 
**EMC & ICP Program**
EMC has new plans for AI computing power growth, AI developers, AI application growth, and AI user growth, all of which are happening in the fast-growing and ever-changing AI era. So in order to seize the opportunity, we must act faster and get better results.
In short, these plans and actions will include but are not limited to the following construction of thousands of computing power nodes, large Web3 & AI Hackathons, thousands of AI applications, ten million AI application users, university research with computing power donations, etc.
Some regions will first realize the cooperation of AI applications for live e-commerce tools, game NPC tools, and social. In particular, EMC & ICP has important value to attract AI developers. They no longer develop in the traditional way of Web2 development, but enter quickly with lower start-up threshold, lighter products and shorter development cycles within the environment of scenario, model, computing power, funding and user integration for quick realization.
AI developers do not need to rely on the platform, publish on the shelf and review. Directly to the users aggregated by EMC and ICP, the development is low-cost with faster and more direct to get rewarded.
 
**SNS Plan and Usage**
-We plan to complete 1,000,000ICP~2,000,000ICP at the rate of 1 ICP = 100 EMC
-We are seeking 33% of the total sale (660,000 ICP) from the Community Fund
-It will be used for computing power network construction, computing power trading market development, AI developer and application aggregation, global community building and business expansion
 
**Next Steps**
For more detailed information about the above and the latest information about EMC, you are welcome to refer to the whitepaper and visit our Twitter, and you are also welcome to talk with us on Telegram and Discord.

EMC is a POW-based project, so we must establish the SNS DAO as soon as possible, so that it can be built, governed and shared by the contributors, AI developers and AI application users in a fairer and more open way. We will reward those who help EMC find vulnerabilities and cheating behavior. Once EMC DAO receives enough feedback and comments, an SNS proposal will start.
We sincerely hope to create more true value for the ICP community, and with your help to make a better EMC and build a better ICP ecosystem. We sincerely hope to build together with all ICP community members, developers, and contributors!

What is the advantages of doing an SNS sale at this point in the development? I know funding can be huge but are there other scenarios where it's better to do it now than later?

-------------------------

jwarner | 2023-05-23 19:22:24 UTC | #4

From the white paper:

> In summary, EMC protocol is a Layer-2 scaling solution for IC that focuses on scheduling edge computing and task allocation to improve the practical performance of decentralized networks.

And

> EMC DAO will adopt a decentralized governance mechanism, allowing members of the EMC community to influence the development direction and decisions of the EMC ecosystem through voting and proposals.

After looking at the team page (which appears to have a lot of experience), and the very focused goal you have summarized by your white paper, I'm not understanding why you would need a large group of people to vote on the development direction? As @Gekctek said, I'm curious as to the advantages of an SNS over a grant request since you already have a detailed end product defined?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-23 21:11:57 UTC | #5

I plan to make a more detailed post regarding my opinion on this, however I haven’t completed my due diligence - just wanted to add this here though;

What holds them to follow the direction outlined by the DAO? DFINITY has shown that the foundation & community perception of priority frequently deviate (namely , followee resets, and any other proposal suggesting code based change by the community). If it is an experienced team with a focused direction, should there not already be a detailed roadmap that they’re following, independently of the DAO?

[/quote]

Isn't the whole purpose of an SNS to force the direction the community wants? This is where I as a newcomer to the ICP community get confused. 

I'm under the impression that an SNS is a very advanced version of a DAO with more features than just being able to vote. With an SNS, proposals are made and executed with code in the canisters. Voters don't just vote and "hope" the proposal is done afterwards by whoever writes code for the DAO, the proposal itself has the changes embedded inside of it and are executed or not based on the vote. So if the company keeps making proposals the community doesn't like, they get rejected and never implemented. And if the community writes a proposal, with code, and it gets adopted, then the changes are implemented.

In my mind, the purpose of an SNS is to drive the direction and provide benefits to users of an already functional product that is looking for a tighter market fit, or to improve feature sets based on community feedback (voting). Maybe I'm wrong here? Also, there may be benefits here that I don't see or understand yet that hopefully the team can shed light on.

Curious about this. Just started my due diligence here so I will voice my concerns here when I am done.

Not really, the point of the SNS in theory is to ensure true decentralization of the DAO. Meaning the DAO canister doesn’t have a centralized controller. The SNS then leverages its framework within the NNS to do a decentralization sale; to which they set the valuation, the token allocation, etc etc. 

@infu recently highlighted it’d cost less than 500k$ to assert a 51% attack on an SNS by the team, assuming recent “foundation” allocations. It’d cost even less if negative sentiment was asserted by the team, to lower token costs, and then acquire the tokens (and i’ve heard it utilizes the followee system, so, might not even be necessary to invest $).

So while the DAO only executes code based proposals, typically they come from few parties. Take ICP as our largest scale example.

It shares many of the downsides of a typical DAO, the main benefit is the fact that the smart contract itself is truly decentralized, not necessarily that the DAO distribution is.

I understand no system will be perfect, and everything you said makes total sense. But my question still stands as to why EMC is proposing an SNS Decentralization sale now? Even if it wasn’t an SNS sale and I saw them post this in a press release totally unrelated to me or ICP. I would be asking this same question.

I’m not trying to be a jerk, or confrontational. I’m really trying to understand from a business perspective, how is it going to benefit them as a business and how will it benefit existing users or customers? Are existing users itching to provide them development directions and they want to organize that feedback in a better way? I have no idea. I have never met one entrepreneur who has argued to have MORE people involved in the decision making process during development of any product. And this is what it sounds like EMC is asking for? Again, I could be wrong.

They can obviously ask and put up the proposal whenever. I’m wondering why now, and why here instead of using some other DAO or direction? In my mind, there is no wrong answer to the question.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-05-24 04:22:14 UTC | #12

The next step on their roadmap is to elect 13 validators and get them running. So from my view it seems the SNS sale is to get interested parties on board so that voting may begin on these validators utilizing the SNS. Since validators are required to stake 1m EMC a decentralization sale helps ensure all validators are not part of the team and its supporters.

In fact the first phase of EMC development has been completed, testNET has been released on 5.10, because the token is ICRC-1 protocol and can only be generated through SNS, both the nodes and the developers buying the computing power need the token for the next step, so we choose to do SNS at this point in time, it is not a temporary decision, we have been working with IC for the previous month This is not an impromptu decision, we have been negotiating with IC and Dfinity fund for the previous month.

EMC is an ecology, although it is still early stage, has gathered 60K-70K AI developers, after the infrastructure is up and running, 12% of the token is for developers, which will provide help for developers through grant or other ways, so the development direction referred to here refers to the AI applications developed on EMC, and the infra resources provided for more valuable applications We want to focus the group's intelligence on applying resources in a more efficient direction and keep the flow of money involved decentralized, which is less easy to quantify with contracts.

-------------------------

EMCprotocol | 2023-05-24 06:16:45 UTC | #15

EMC has already signed MOU with some big mining pools in filecoin ecosystem, they participated in presale and bought enough pledged token, will set up 1-3 validation nodes and some routing nodes of testNET this week, these nodes information will be public on twitter and community. IC's nodes in Hong Kong and Australia are also communicating with EMC team to join the nodes. The situation of Ethernet miners is slightly more complicated. Professional ETH miners cannot access EMC network, and graphics miners have to make some hardware upgrades (CPU, RAM, hard disk, etc.) to match the performance of GPU. All these work is being done one after another.

The EMC project, combined with AI and ICP, has huge potential. I am thrilled to see such a capable team driving the development of IC.

I am very interested in the roadmap described in the white paper, but currently, the roadmap does not have a timeline. Could you provide a more detailed update so that we can better understand your plan?

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-24 09:23:30 UTC | #19

Why is it that you can only create an ICRC1 via the SNS? This certainly isn’t the only way to create a token, a DAO, or to go about tokenizing - so what makes the SNS a good option for you?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-24 09:25:35 UTC | #20

What?? Your justifying lack of relationship with community for lack of knowledge in our ecosystem? This isn’t even how creating an ICRC works.

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-24 09:28:40 UTC | #21

60k-70k developers on-boarded? Your layer 2 is 150x bigger than DFINITY? How are you aggregating these metrics? Are you insinuating this is an inflow for ICP? Why have we not seen these developers?

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-24 11:58:44 UTC | #23

It is not a comparable number when you count the total of web3 developer vs total developer (more or less Web2 developer globally). The priority and focus should be on business model itself and how to expand web3 ecosystem to attract web2 developer. just quoting some number from statista there are ~28M professional developer WW, >2M in China. 12% token allocation will be developer Grant Reserve which aim to provide early support for the community of AIGC developer in web2 (60-70k) of which we are already actively participate and collaborate in China, and expanding our community foot print into South East Asia. For example, an INDI studio or small AIGC developer, can now utilize EMC on-chain AI computing to train stable-diffusion model with their own ART assets (store on IC canister) and developing their DApp frontend to deploy on IC canister and provide their version of "Mid-journey" and generate income through SaaS model. EMC already working with a start-up team who build this and accumulated 160K paying user over 6months. What is all matter is Real business that gerenate Revenue, and for them to pay for ICP+EMC services as paying for AWS.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-24 12:13:34 UTC | #24

To provider a clarification, launching an SNS decentralization sales serve few key purposes, EMC on-chain AI computing node is rewarded based on POW (behind all the ideology and tech, what EMC really do is recycling ETH miners or FIL block miners (GPU pool) and converting the GPU into proof of useful work (AI model training). POW mining require consensus, open and fair mechanism. Result of SNS sales will be a DAO, ICRC-1 token will be minted before the mainnet launch and to used for staking of validator node and routing node in EMC network.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-24 12:31:24 UTC | #25

We appreciate valuable input and question related to EMC, but certainly do not think that referencing to other project or making unrelated statement would have meaningful conversation.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-24 12:55:48 UTC | #26

EMC is designed as the specialty network focus on providing extended capability to current ICP network in processing on-chain AI model training. EMC consensus mechanism and tokenology design are build on ICP (EMC team has done months of research and validation during the design phase, comparing most L1 and even debating on designing EMC as L1). Summarize why EMC build on ICP, 1/ Focus is to solve AI computing power needs and scavenge abandon ETH miners and idling Fil block miners GPUs, EMC never plan to build another ICP who can host DApp on chain. 2/ DApp developer for AIGC and AI application, would start with AI model training and end with building their AIGC DApp that can host and provide web service to User without gas (ICP not only perfect choice but only L1 choice)  3/ Web2 developer to Web3 transformation (leverage on all the benefit and feature of ICP) AI + AIGC open up new opportunity to attract web2 developer to build on Web3 and share the same mission with ICP, first developer to build great DApp product and attract web2 user to use DApp providing seemless UX as web2. Last but not least, what is important is all lead to large increase of cycles burned in ICP network.

There are many ways to produce an icrc token without SNS. Origyn has had one since November of 2021(fork of ICP) and Nat Laos has a very robust motoko icrc implementation.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-24 13:12:38 UTC | #28

Why now? If you follow the development roadmap of EMC, EMC is at the stage of testnet, with 150 nodes over 20+ countries launched on 10th May. Current development roadmap is aiming for 3 months target for mainnet launch. EMC design include POW (computing node), POS (validator node) which involve creating of consensus among node participant, best address by DAO. Why SNS? EMC is building as L2 of ICP, it make sense to have NNS community participate in EMC DAO to ensure that voting of the future development of EMC roadmap synergize and strategize with ICP roadmap. While funding is important element to accelerate the project, drive adoption and building ecosystem, the other reason of SNS and Now is more strategic than just fund raising.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-24 13:17:10 UTC | #29

We could certainly use DIP20 or DRC 20 taken within SNS, which is what we are doing for the presales over last weekend for implementing of validator node and staking mechanism for Testnet. However, if we are expecting to build L2 project that are strategically integrated with ICP as L1, and driving participation of thousands of new non-ICP standard note (mainly ETH and FIL miners) , we would want to do it the proper way, with open, transaprent and most important support from ICP communities.

I’m not following your logic; why can you not make an ICRC without the SNS?

This is not true, as previously stated by others in this thread.

Sorry for the harsh criticism, and open to later changing my mind, but from my first impressions, this project reeks of AI buzzwords and lack of understanding of how the IC works. Saying you have gathered 60-70k AI developers is a **rediculous** stat.

The fact the first thing these guys want to do before showing anyone their product is white paper and SNS is a red flag 🚩. 


To EMC - if you have a real idea, prove it working with a few “fake” validators, and demo the result. 

Publish performance metrics. 

Get real IC devs using your AI as a service. 

If you’re going to SNS, then you’ll need to open source your project as well.

Welcome EMC Team to ICP! 

Its great to see all the interesting projects building on the IC.

I've not fully researched the project - just read the above comments. One thing that stands out for me is the massive community fund request. Personally I dont think that will fly with a lot of people. 

Is there a demo or some kind of promo video where I could see what you've built so far?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-24 15:31:48 UTC | #36

It may not be a scam but they certainly aren’t technically qualified in regards to ICP, to even convey why they want to create an SNS. And I say that with all due respect.

“This is the only way we can create an ICRC” has been the worst reasoning I’ve heard yet.

I don't recall saying there is no relationship with the ICP community, but I think the above statistics related to your presence online says you haven't been engaged with the community for that long.

Regardless of the above, it is my understanding, that the project is essentially going to try and farm compute power from anywhere and everywhere to power AI projects. This is definitely not a bad idea. It is not one I necessarily agree with at this point in time, but it is definitely something for me to think about. Thank you for responding to my posts and good luck with your project!

This has me very very concerned. You can pay people to create flashy websites and whitepapers. 

What I'd like to see is a bit of sweat equity showing a demo product on the IC. I really don't want to be hostile to new projects because we've all been there :: but you can understand that the age of the accounts is strange!

I like the idea... but everything is screaming SCAM!

The 60,000 to 70,000 AI developers mentioned are from the developer community our EMC team has collaborated with in the Web2 industry over the past two years. They are not specifically DApp developers but experienced Web2 developers (such as those from Alibaba, Netease, Unity community, etc.) who have shown interest in the rapidly growing AGI industry. 

When EMC is deployed on ICP, it will also recommend ICP to those AI developers. AI applications can leverage ICP's fully on-chain DApps and EMC to achieve cost reduction in hosting. 

As for how many AI developers can be converted into DApp developers on ICP, it depends on the progress of development. SNS provides an opportunity for these DApp developers to participate in project decision-making, which can help facilitate the conversion process.

MillionMiles | 2023-05-25 02:17:22 UTC | #42

I want to remind everyone that the competitive environment in the crypto industry for ICP is extremely severe. It's rare to have a reliable project willing to join the IC ecosystem, and what EMC is doing is absolutely a huge opportunity for IC in the future. It is irresponsible to label a project as a scam based on superficial information like the short duration of their social media account registrations. It would be best for everyone to patiently wait for an explanation from EMC.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 02:31:36 UTC | #43

If I were a potential node contributor, I would need to invest in hardware power and other resources. I would want the emc to be decentralized. icp contracts can be upgraded is a double-edged sword, on the one hand, you can adjust the contract with the development, on the other hand, the contract controller authority is too large. Delivering the contract to sns solves this problem to a large extent. So this stage must start sns, so that more and bigger node contributors feel comfortable to participate.

I am the co-founder of EMC and can find my profile through my Twitter. For those who comment without doing your due dilligent, I urge you to pay respect to our team of 30 developers and work that we have done over last 6 months as a bootstrape. What you have posted is true on the date of registering the website and other official account, EMC and the name of this project was only decided few days before we finalize our master plan, and we completed all the DD and decided to go with ICP and since than we have been working with ICP Asia team on getting started with ICP and securing Grant and meet-up with Dom in HK Web3 event on Apr. Unlike all other Web3 project, we are experienced Enterpreneur and successful start-up team in Web2 world that decided to All-in Web3 2 years ago. We started our business and profit generating by building Metaverse DApp, with over 100K of user, the project is profit generating and self-sustaining, while we dediced to focus our core engineering resource to address the AI-computing shortage, a key problem that slowing down our communities and developer on building AIGC project. Sincerely to all, who do not know our team, we will formerly introduce EMC core team member to ICP community, EMC is bringing NOT a whitepaper but a project that under development over 1 years, and competely our testnet launch on 10th May. Our developer community and teams has already start building prototype on EMC testnet and will share more in coming week.

It’s being portrayed as though these are reasons to do an SNS, or that this is the only solution, but the fact of the matter is, there are already many solutions regarding blackholed canisters. If the team has not done their due diligence on the ICP blockchain to understand these basic functionalities, why should ICP take the risk on a team that hasn’t even shown a demo yet. 

Let’s not forget that the SNS is meant for complete products. This clearly isn’t that.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-25 03:01:20 UTC | #46

Let me share some data to you, Statista (you can google) shows that there are >2.4m professional developer in China, as a working project over 2 years with >100K of community members and active partication from one of the leading AIGC developer community (with 60-70K) in China, REAL developer from Web2 world is now seriouly coming to build thier AIGC model with the support of cheap and assessable computing power for AI provided by EMC, this is just MARK the beginning of the grant migration of Web2 developer and than Web2 User to the Web3 world. I came from Web2 world and I certainly know how small is the current Web3 developer in total and never mentioned about the limited actual working DApp and web3 user comparing to Web2.

Thanks for your thorough research! Web3 is open and free, the IC community is also very diligent and serious, which is something that the speculative world of Web3 often lacks.

That's also why we chose ICP among numerous public chains. We aim to create valuable Web3 infrastructure and applications for real world! We want to bring the developers, designers, MCN agencies, and a large number of users from the Asia-Pacific region that we have partnered to into the ICP ecosystem.

A new project does not necessarily mean a new team. From the team's background, it is evident that EMC is comprised of experienced individuals in both Web2 and Web3. We have a wealth of experience in developing and operating platforms with millions of users in the Web2 space. In the Web3 realm, we have experience with EVM, Filecoin, Cosmos, and more. 

Regarding the EMC project, we had the idea of decentralized computing power for the metaverse rendering and gaming market 3 years ago. As you can see, our team also has backgrounds in AWS and Unity. 

We formally started preparing for this decentralized computing project one year ago and have shared our plans in various online and offline forums (mainly in Asia and Chinese community). Thus we receive a grant from ICP (as KSANA, now as EMC). So you can find our project is on the ecosystem homepage of ICP: https://internetcomputer.org/ecosystem?source=nav 

As ChatGPT and midjourney demonstrated their global impact last year, we carefully assessed the demand for edge computing power in the AGI field. Combined with the surplus computing power brought by the ETH 2.0 upgrade, we officially launched EMC six months ago. 

While we are developing the underlying protocols, we are also seeking a suitable Layer1 solution that can accommodate a large number of AI developers and users. At the same time, we want to ensure that the user experience is not burdened with gas fees at every step. After evaluating options like Polygon, Cosmos, Polkadot, and receiving invitations from some public chains, we ultimately chose reverse-gas ICP. As a Web3 builder myself, I am deeply inspired by ICP's vision of being a world computer and its PoUW (Proof of Useful Work) concept. 

We maintained close communication with Herbert and Paul from the DFINITY Foundation last year, and after meeting Dominic in Hong Kong this year, we officially recognized ICP as a reliable Layer1 solution. As a result, we have started the migration of numerous projects and the token minting process to facilitate the integration of our accumulated resources such as miners, developers, and MCNs into ICP.

I will invite you to do your due dilligent, setup a call with me to find out more detail. Your quote of 60-70K AI developer as "rediculous" stat, just means that you have not seen this doesn't mean it is not exist.

Please read through my earlier reply, I have lay out the strategic reason about our team decided to join ICP community and clear vision of what we going to do together with ICP. As a co-founder and key designer of business model and strategic development for EMC, I have invest significant time on meeting up with ICP Global leadership team as well as key investors of ICP and KOLs in Asia community. Doing an SNS launched is strategic decision, alongside we are also doing VC rounds speaking with reputable Web3 VCs. To comment that our team is not technically qualified in regards of ICP, I would rather take the words from Sam and ICP Global R&D team.

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-05-25 03:32:13 UTC | #50

As experienced EVM developers, we are indeed in the process of relearning when it comes to ICP. Despite our previous expertise, ICP presents its own unique learning curve and challenges. However, we are fully committed to embracing this new technology and ecosystem. We recognize the value and potential of ICP and are dedicated to honing our skills and knowledge to contribute effectively to its development.

In many aspects, our understanding of ICP may not be comprehensive, and we are constantly engaging in discussions with the DFINITY Foundation team and community developers. 

As you know, the Web3 space is relatively small market (compared to Web2). Our goal is to bring more Web2 developers and users into Web3 through AGI & AIGC, rather than creating a hierarchical Web3 community! 

Personally, I studied cryptography at Bristol and have translated numerous articles on Bitcoin and Ethereum. I have also been involved in projects like Status, BanklessDAO, all of which are dedicated to building a global and **open community**. 

Vitalik has faced mockery from Bitcoin Core, and ICP has been misunderstood by the outside world. Even today, Bitcoin and Web3 are still considered scams by a large part of the world. 

However, as true believers in blockchain, in the past years of working in blockchain industry, we have often encountered a lack of understanding from friends and even family members. Only we know that we are creating a new world. We are builders, not speculators.

I want my child to live in a truly secure digital world built on blockchain technology and not be labeled as fraudsters by outsiders. 

EMC has already released the API documentation for the first Openverse framework based on edge computing protocols (Stable Diffusion model)  and deployed it within Canisters. Three teams have already started migrating their projects with over 150,000 users based on this framework. https://57hlm-riaaa-aaaap-qbhfa-cai.icp0.io/#/info

We are also working towards releasing consumer-facing demos to showcase the capabilities of EMC and the framework.

justmythoughts | 2023-05-25 03:55:33 UTC | #51

I think the major feedback here is that you have an interesting idea, but validate it first **without** the SNS.

The SNS is mainly for slightly more mature apps with traction and users, not a proof of concept. You’ll get resistance from the community if you try to SNS too early on. Come back with a product that is working, already adding significant value, and is ready for decentralization.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-05-25 05:43:56 UTC | #52

I would actually recommend this meeting.  @justmythoughts is a talented developer and active participant in ICP governance and I would definitely trust what he has to say.  He is fair and civilized when he asks tough questions.  If he is willing/able to meet, then I’m sure it would be a productive conversation.

I.look forward to learning more from the EMC team in the coming weeks.  Thanks for starting the conversation now.

zire | 2023-05-25 06:07:28 UTC | #53

@EMCprotocol is not a scam. It's a legit startup founded by a group of very experienced tech entrepreneurs from China. Members of the current IC community may or may not understand or agree with the way EMC team articulates their vision. That's all fine and I think the EMC team is open for suggestions and discussions. As @MillionMiles of 8yeargangDAO said, we in the IC community should extend open arms to welcome new players to embrace IC, not to trash them. 

While it's reasonable to perform your own due diligence on an IC project, let me share a few notes about the particular situation in China:

* China has about 7 million developers vs 24 million in the rest of the world. China has the second most number of unicorns in the world after US and is quickly catching up (say, ByteDance). Most of those developers or tech entrepreneurs are NOT on Twitter. Though Twitter seems like the way of life for crypto folks and the only place that matters to prove someone's presence in crypto, it is not for Chinese. Every popular social media platform, from Facebook, Youtube, Google, Instagram, Reddit, Medium, Discord and Twitter is banned in China. It's entirely possible that a famous KOL of millions of fans in China only has a puny presence on Twitter. According to [Statista, WeChat is now a top 5 social media global platform with 1.3 billion MAU and Twitter is No. 14 with 556 million MAU](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). I'm not trying to back up any specific number from EMC for them but merely saying that there is a much bigger parallel universe out there beyond the usual Twitter/DFINITY Dev Forum/Discord etc. ICP is uniquely positioned to attract developers from that parallel universe (which has been dominated by Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and ByteDance) and EMC is now trying to bridge to that crowd with its integration to ICP.

* The entire crypto industry is pretty tiny compared to the traditional Web2 space. ICP, if viewed as a decentralized AWS, is the only blockchain that can speak to literally millions of developers who are used to building on AWS/Azure/GCP in kubernetes (and every self-respectable developer is now toying with chatGPT/AIGC). Right now, there is no elegant solution for the crypto industry to reach out to this much bigger cohort, for a variety of reasons that [Signal's founder Moxie laid out in his famous "My First Impression of Web3" article in Jan 2022](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). I'd encourage members of the IC community to be more open-minded and try to help the new kid on the block. Yes, they're new, but isn't that what we're trying to do here, to bring in new blood who shares our vision and audacity? We should cheer for someone who just created an account on this forum recently, not to make that a liability for them.

With this out of way, please go back to your suggestions and feedback to the EMC team on how they can present themselves better in the IC community, engage the community, and earn that trust. Thank you.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-05-25 06:22:59 UTC | #54

Thank you for this post Herbert!  I agree with you 100% and hope that more people start speaking up in this way.  I’d rather see the community offering more support and less criticism to project teams.

Witokek | 2023-05-25 06:38:46 UTC | #55

Is Dfinity seriously trying to give money to them? The GitHub is empty!!!!

I can understand the desperation to jump on the AI train, but this is not it.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 06:59:26 UTC | #56

Hello, I am a co-founder of EMC. Thank you for your rational response. The EMC whitepaper was based on my 10+ years of financial investment and technology background, and went through more than 20 revisions before the final draft. I have personally read over 200 project whitepapers, and I believe that a mature investor can easily discern whether a whitepaper has been ghostwritten. Spending tens of thousands of dollars cannot produce the entire architecture of EMC (if there were such skilled writers, they could easily do their own projects). I have discussed potential issues with over 30 well-known VC partners in person, and have addressed each challenge one by one. If you check Twitter, you will find historical recordings of various AMAs (some in Chinese) that were viewed by up to 10,000 people. These data are all real and valid, including Twitter, Discord, etc. EMC has never wasted money on buying bot farms. In fact, it is easy to tell by just clicking on some of the followers' accounts. The EMC team is a very complete organizational structure, with partners including a CFO of a US-listed company, a partner of a well-known law firm, and a founder of a listed company. If you are interested later, we will make public the backgrounds of all partners. The reason why these social media platforms were established not long ago is due to some special reasons in China. However, it is not difficult to achieve rapid growth with good content operations in China. One of the apps operated by an EMC enterprise in China has over 80 million downloads, which can be checked in China's application market. We hope to help these web2 users enter web3, and choosing ICP was a carefully considered decision. This is because when designing the entire architecture of EMC, we had to meet the following two requirements:

1. Because AI applications need to lead a large number of web2 users, no gas is the first factor.
2. Because EMC's state machine needs to roll up to the main chain with a data peak of 1M/s, the cost-effectiveness requirement for the main chain is very high. In the early stages, we compared almost all public chains, including ETH, Solana, Cosmos Hub, Polkadot, etc., and found that ICP was the most suitable.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 07:05:00 UTC | #57

EMC will synchronize the code to GitHub before SNS. Please be patient and do not jump to conclusions.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 07:22:45 UTC | #58

In addition, initially we named the project KSANA and positioned it as a social metaverse. We also launched a decentralized computing power project internally with the development code name E = mc². Before the launch, we decided to change the name to EMC as everyone felt that Edge Matrix Computing Network was a fitting abbreviation. This is also one of the reasons why the domain name and social media registration time were too short. If you are interested, you can check ksana.io.

tiago89 | 2023-05-25 07:29:34 UTC | #59

Zed,

I am not relevant as a voter, but my impression is that the project is not live on IC yet.

I would strongly advise to execute the project, confirm it's viable, get some traction showing the business is also economically viable.

THEN a sale can happen, where there is a transfer of money from the side of Community, and a transfer of assets (the canisters that are controlling an ecosystem and generating revenue) to the community.

Asking it too soon is a bad deal for the community, it's understandable they react negatively. They are not being against the project, just feeling it's too soon.

Could you be open to give a try first with your own token, and then later, imagine 6 or 12 months from now, consider doing the SNS sale with an airdrop to the owners of the first coin? You can pretty much replace it at the time. That way you will have numbers and substantial assets to transfer on the sale, think that would succeed.

And until then, we are all here to contribute and help growing the project.

Let me know your thoughts, and thanks for choosing the IC to work with in your venture.

I haven't seen any benefits that EMC has brought to the ICP ecosystem. Is EMC only financing through SNS?

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 08:32:47 UTC | #61

Thank you for your suggestion. EMC needs the help of the community. In fact, the team has been receiving technical assistance in IC in recent months, and we would like to thank Paulliu for his help. We have set up a complete ICP test network and deployed IC Canister contracts on the test network. In the next few days, we will switch the contracts to the ICP mainnet. I know that the beginning is always difficult, and it is normal to have many doubts before seeing the code running. The entire EMC team will handle these doubts rationally and answer them carefully. However, I also have to say responsibly that we have founded and managed several large enterprises, and we are confident in our ability to control resources and manage development. In the coming time, we will let the community see the speed of EMC's project.

Your attitude regarding people doing due diligence has become very concerning.

I am starting to wonder why you are so controlling over other governance factors, yet completely silent in this regard - until you feel the need to pitch in from the sidelines and assign negative connotations to people asking questions?

Rather conflicting, on one hand, you say you do not need to learn more about ICP, on the other, you say you are still re-learning. 


Regardless, neither of these address any of my concerns, regarding the benefit of doing an SNS now, before a product is live or security audits are done.

It was my impression the SNS is for complete products, not ones still being actively developed. 

Like many others, I also reccomend the team to utilize alternative DAO tooling (as it exists, and is possible), deploy main net, showcase value-add to the network, and then re-explore the SNS DAO with a more finalized product down the line. 

Will provide a more detailed analysis once I’ve completed my DD on this project. Not trying to discourage the team, I understand we all have to start somewhere when building something new. I appreciate the transparency & professionalism in recent responses.

AI itself is experiencing explosive growth, and I meet 2-3 groups of AGI developers every week, such as AI imaging, AI video, AI podcasts, AI scripts, AI 3D, industry-specific AI models, and more. 

All of these rely on computing power. Currently, GPUs are scarce resources, and many small teams cannot afford the high GPU costs for training purposes. 

However, the crypto industry accumulated a significant amount of computational power. EMC utilizes intelligent routing algorithms to manage the supply and demand relationship between AI developers and computational power. 

The transaction data will be rolled up into IC canisters, bringing tremendous traffic and liquidity to IC and giving rise to a robust AI+Web3 ecosystem. 

By matching idle computational power with small and medium-sized AI developers, EMC becomes a green infrastructure. 

As for SNS, there isn't a definitive consensus within the community. However, we have obtained permission from the DFINITY Foundation and maintain close communication regarding the SNS process.

As a new developer who was involved in EMC a few weeks ago, I was amazed by the fantastic idea that can help developers, such as our team, to launch AI applications with lower costs and earn rewards directly and easily. I have worked with Aliyun clouds for years, so I realize that programmers and AI developers in mainland China are restricted by local and global politics seriously. Although we always worked and studied pretty hard, we needed to face difficulties in fetching members and the risk that may lead to job losses too.

The EMC program indeed relaxes developers in these cases. First, we can access computing power when our projects need to practice new AI models, comparing to the price of Aliyun or AWS. EMC offers us reliable and affordable matrix power too. The most important attraction to us is that EMC also provides a chance, like a gateway, which will lead our team to join the ICP group. These pieces of information and co-workers might encourage more and more Chinese programmers to join EMC & ICP.

In addition, most of the Chinese programmers learned about ICP when they studied in university or college. Plenty of articles from ICP are really popular in China.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-05-25 15:00:15 UTC | #69

@zire, thanks for chiming in!

I think all of us are on the same page regarding welcoming any projects and developers to the IC!

What motivated most people here to speak up was the **upcoming SNS sale** in the post title. Therefore, I don’t think the criticism here is unfair or unwarranted.

Here’s the founder of ICP, Dominic Williams’ own perspective - https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-is-the-bar-for-a-project-decentralizing-with-the-sns/19906.

I agree 100% with you this is probably a communication barrier thing.

Herbert, maybe you can help communicate DFINITY’s vision on what the SNS is for, and when a project is ready to SNS to the IC Asia community?

Right now, this forum is full of SNS project announcements all over, with each project having over 1yr of being public on the IC - all are getting their due diligence and constructive criticism (like any company that fundraises or IPOs). 

If you are a project that wants to announce an upcoming SNS - the community will do their DD on you.

If you don’t want that level of scrutiny or aren’t ready for it - there’s no pressure to SNS. On ICP, anyone can launch their own token and project without an SNS!

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-05-25 15:34:26 UTC | #70

Based on the opinions of the community, I think the foundation should abstain again this time and leave it to users to vote.I have the same problem as Sonic.

EMCprotocol | 2023-05-25 17:03:24 UTC | #71

Bounty program

We are inviting experienced developers to test EMC network. To ensure fairness, interested parties are required to set up one node using the instructions on https://edgematrix.pro/start. (Linux/Mac , you don't need to sync all block heights to test the interface.) After setting up the node, testers should input the node ID on https://57hlm-riaaa-aaaap-qbhfa-cai.icp0.io/#/info and complete the entire edge node computing test.（https://oregon.edgematrix.xyz is router node for testing）

This will help testers understand EMC’s working principles. Those who submit the test process and their observations will be rewarded with ICP and EMC, and their transaction records will be made public. The first three testers will receive  50 ICP and 5000 EMC each，while the rest will be added to the airdrop list as a token of gratitude for their time.

Testers must deploy an AI application locally that provides a Restful API. The tool is for technical personnel and developers of computing nodes to demonstrate the testing of the node's computing interface and the process of calling AI computing power from the backend of the application. After the backend application is tested successfully, users can use emc_sdk to rewrite their original way of calling AI computing power, using a more economical decentralized computing power.

To query the node ID, use the following command:
$ ./edge-matrix secrets output --data-dir edge_data

To start the AI computing node, use one of the following commands:
1. Start in foreground
$./edge-matrix server --chain genesis.json --data-dir ./edge_data --grpc-address 0.0.0.0:50000 --libp2p 0.0.0.0:50001 --jsonrpc 0.0.0.0:50002   --app-url  http://<Ip for ai server>:<port> --app-name  your_AI_Service_name

2. Start in background
$ nohup ./edge-matrix server --chain genesis.json --data-dir edge_data  --grpc-address 0.0.0.0:50000 --libp2p 0.0.0.0:50001 --jsonrpc 0.0.0.0:50002  --log-to node.log  --app-url  http://<Ip for ai server>:<port> --app-name  your_AI_Service_name  >edge_nohup.out 2>&1 &

Example:
$./edge-matrix server --chain genesis.json --data-dir ./edge_data --grpc-address 0.0.0.0:50000 --libp2p 0.0.0.0:50001 --jsonrpc 0.0.0.0:50002  --app-url http://127.0.0.1:7860 --app-name StableDifussion_lora

Note:
1. The AI computing power service requires a Restful API interface that can be called by the local EMC computing power node.
2. Deploying an edge computing power node requires a connection to the public network, and there is no need to open ports in the local firewall. The AI service interface of the edge node can be called by any Router Node that provides Rpc services on the EMC network through the P2P protocol.

Additional notes:
The computing power node deployer can customize the idl.json file to facilitate the tool's recognition of specific key interfaces. The idl.json file needs to be placed in the same directory as edge-matrix executable.
The idl.json configuration file format is as follows:

[
   {
    "path": "/sdapi/v1/txt2img",
    "method": "POST",
    "desc": "text to image",

I'm glad you have clarified that there is some kind of relationship between the project and Dfinity. 

I think that ICP is a welcoming place and but since FTX/ LUNA the crypto space has become very aware of glossy hopium. The lack of visible history is a legitimate concern, however I do note that we are mostly unaware of China social media. 

That said.. I still think that they are missing any working product?

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 16:57:22 UTC | #74

No one is procrastinating. The EMC team is working more than 14.5 hours per day per person, and dozens of people are completing the workload of hundreds of people. A few VC interviews joined temporarily interrupted some work, but we will make up for it before the weekend.

-------------------------

aakh1361 | 2023-05-25 17:13:48 UTC | #75

When I see that dfinity approves a project, I don't have to worry about it being a rug, I'm sure the dfinity team has already checked, my only concern is how successful the project can be.

https://chatbox.fun/

I think this is a test case of the EMC project

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 17:46:33 UTC | #76

chatbox is a decentralized social application developed by a small team and built on the EMC network. It is positioned as a portal for AI applications and it is still early stage and there are not enough nodes in the EMC network to provide enough computing power for it. Only about a few thousand people are currently using it. But chatbox is so promising that it has received funding from EMC. In the next 6 months, the EMC will divert 1 million users to chatbox to help it grow.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-25 17:45:03 UTC | #77

BTW: my chatbox address: 0xA00C41E827E67e0B8D855baC622B4DbF739002bC

skilesare | 2023-05-25 21:53:22 UTC | #78

This is super interesting, but can you give me an "explain like I'm a dense teenager" of what I'm actually running on my machine?  If I understand it well I'm super interested in trying it out.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-05-25 22:45:06 UTC | #79

Yes. Honestly I am very confused. EMC is announcing its intention to SNS as soon as possible, even though the product has not launched yet? That is not how the SNS should be used. 

Please tell me if I am misunderstanding something.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-26 01:25:30 UTC | #80

I am sharing my personal thought on SNS is for complete products. There are whole lots of different definition on complete product, as a seasoned investor previously working with large PE/VC, the maturity of product certainly go by stages, to be OC is at the very early phase of MVP with early adopter and users on the product, in the old school would probably consider this a pre-A series, as the team has yet to proof the commercialization model (paying user and ARPU) or new user acqusition model generally tie to CAC, the same comment applicable for Hotornot as well. Having said that, we are in this complete new Web3 world, the project teams decided to tokenise and create a DAO at this early stage, yet, I don't see any operationalize plan and business model taking about how to generate revenue to the platform or just simply a free community tools for everyone to use and monetize through Ad. Without all these, I would definitely not investing my ICP in this DApp, at least at this stage. Pardon me for my way of discription on the following to SAS (no offence to ICP): we shall not turn SNS into a "Pet (DApp) Shop" where we buy the "Pet" and getting all the joy of the companion of our lovely pet and without needing to consider the ROI of our investment, how this DApp will bring in incremental liquidity or user to ICP and hence increase the entire value of ICP ecosystem that result in higher token price. If the DApp is only used in current ICP communities, this is really just a circulation of ICP within current pool.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-26 02:19:05 UTC | #81

EMC is an infra, not a dapp. In fact, the product has already been launched, but it is too big to be seen.
Just like when vitalik launched ethereum with smart contracts, someone asked, where is your product

-------------------------

WoW | 2023-05-26 04:19:40 UTC | #82

Just tried out running some cat photos using the given link.

Edit the prompt and styles and execute, the response time is decent. (Compare running with my own GPU)
BTW seems you need to convert the base64 to png yourself.

One question for the team, there is some 'NSFW' AIGC too, whats your policy towards that?

Hello @ninadou, thank you for bringing more insight and information to the discussion. There appears to be a possible language/cultural barrier squeezing into this discussion and I want to provide some feedback from someone who doesn't hold a lot of voting power, but has been watching the crypto space for a long time. My TLDR is below, but if any of the EMC team wants more feedback from a small American retail investor, read on after that.

My TLDR is the same as @justmythoughts : 

[quote="justmythoughts, post:51, topic:20194"]
I think the major feedback here is that you have an interesting idea, but validate it first **without** the SNS.
[/quote]

**Feedback for EMC in hopes it can help in the future**: I have been scammed, invested in projects that started out great then died, and used the FTX exchange based on almost everyone saying Sam Bankman-Fried was a genius and if you didn't invest in his projects or listen to him, you were stupid. I thought if everyone else was doing their due diligence and investing in SBF, I should too. Turned out, I was wrong. Now, I do my own research.

[quote="zire, post:53, topic:20194"]
* Yes, they’re new, but isn’t that what we’re trying to do here, to bring in new blood who shares our vision and audacity? We should cheer for someone who just created an account on this forum recently, not to make that a liability for them.

With this out of way, please go back to your suggestions and feedback to the EMC team on how they can present themselves better in the IC community, engage the community, and earn that trust.
[/quote]

With respect to the statement from @zire above, I hope this is helpful. I do not mean to come across angry, condescending, mean, or negative to you or your project. I wish you nothing but success. But I cannot verify the following statements, therefore I personally cannot trust they are true.

[quote="ninadou, post:47, topic:20194"]
From the team’s background, it is evident that EMC is comprised of experienced individuals in both Web2 and Web3. We have a wealth of experience in developing and operating platforms with millions of users in the Web2 space. In the Web3 realm, we have experience with EVM, Filecoin, Cosmos, and more.
[/quote]

Are you talking about the backgrounds listed on the web site? If you're asking me to trust what you wrote on the web site is true, I'm sorry, I don't. So, I attempted to dig deeper and verify your team has developed and operated platforms with millions of users. Unfortunately, with only using tools available to the general public, I wasn't able to verify all of it.

The first was Alexis Zed: 
* Alexis Zed (I was unable to pin this name to an actual person. Possible nickname instead using actual name?)

* Co-founder & CEO

* Master of Computational Mathematics , MSU (Is this a United States instituion? Michigan State?)

* More than 7 years quantitative trading experience in US stock (Where? At an actual firm?)

* Founder of DGame NFT marketplace (I could not find any NFT marketplace called DGame using a simple google search. Is this in another country? Do you have a link, even in another language?)

Next is Alex Goh:

* Alex Goh ( I found all of the information below also listed [HERE](https://rocketreach.co/alex-goh-email_1972548) which gave me more confidence in the project. I did not dig deeper.)

* Co-Founder & Global Partner Market Development

* MBA of Macquarie University

* More than 20 years of Global Market development

* Formerly GM of Improbable.io Greater China

* Formerly GM of Amazon Web Service, Global Account

* Formerly MD & GM of Fosun South East Asia

Next is Shawn:

* Shawn (With just the name "Shawn", it is impossible to verify anything below, so I cannot believe it is true.)

* Technical Partner & CTO

* More than 10 years experience in Mobile Internet

* Experienced and results-driven Contract Engineer with 15 years of experience in P2P communication

* Responsible for the product development of Telecom's billion-level concurrent large-scale commercial Applications

Next is Ping:

* Ping (I was able to find a Twitter profile [HERE](https://twitter.com/ping_pub) which is active and mostly referencing Cosmos. Again, this shows there is an actual person attached to this name. I also checked out the Github [HERE](https://github.com/liangping) which is also active and current but unrelated to EMC. This information leads me to believe the below is true, but I did not dig any deeper.)

* Blockchain Architect

* Founder of Ping.pub

* Early developer of Cosmos hub

* Award of COSMOS GOS hackathon and space race hackathon

* Wanxiang Blockchain Hackathon runner-up

Last was Allen Foo:

* Allen Foo (I found the LinkedIn profile [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenfoo/?originalSubdomain=cn) which made me confident this was an actual person. I did not dig any deeper.)

* Product & Technical Advisor

* Founder & CEO of UCCVR Early Stage VC fund and VooX

* Formerly Head of Unity Greater China

* Formerly Head of Microsoft’s Greater China Server business (included the current Azure Cloud business)

Unfortunately, I did not see any reference to Ksana or EMC, in any of those profiles. A little odd to me if everyone on the team is so sure these projects are going to be the next big thing, but not a huge red flag. Given what I was able to find online, I still find it hard to believe your claim of developing and operating platforms with millions of users. Not that it isn't true, I was just not able to satisfy the claim with the information I found.

[quote="alxgoh, post:44, topic:20194"]
I urge you to pay respect to our team of 30 developers and work that we have done over last 6 months as a bootstrape.
[/quote]

Hello @alxgoh, I would be happy to pay respect to your team of 30 developers if I was easily able to find out who they are. I believe this also may be one of the instances of a cultural and language barrier. To me (an American) the term "bootstrap" means "the process of using only existing resources, such as personal savings, personal computing equipment, and garage space, to start and grow a company". But as your team has said above, the project started as Ksana back in 2021? And I believe Ksana has received grants and other investments before turning into EMC. It is not a bootstrapped project with respect to the American meaning of that term.

[quote="ninadou, post:47, topic:20194"]
Thus we receive a grant from ICP (as KSANA, now as EMC).
[/quote]

[quote="alxgoh, post:48, topic:20194"]
I will invite you to do your due dilligent, setup a call with me to find out more detail.
[/quote]

I will not call you, because you can say anything you want. With all due respect, I do not trust you.  I need to verify everything with as much factual data from other sources.

[quote="alxgoh, post:49, topic:20194"]
Doing an SNS launched is strategic decision, alongside we are also doing VC rounds speaking with reputable Web3 VCs. To comment that our team is not technically qualified in regards of ICP, I would rather take the words from Sam and ICP Global R&D team.
[/quote]

If I cannot verify what Sam and the ICP Global R&D team are saying, I won't trust their statements either, as much as I respect their work. Trusting statements from very smart people in the past has caused me to lose money. I try to avoid that now.

[quote="zed.emc, post:56, topic:20194"]
I have discussed potential issues with over 30 well-known VC partners in person, and have addressed each challenge one by one. If you check Twitter, you will find historical recordings of various AMAs (some in Chinese) that were viewed by up to 10,000 people.
[/quote]

 Hi @zed.emc, what is you Twitter handle? I could not find it with my basic search. I love to learn and listen to AMA's. I think listening to these would go a long way in helping the community build confidence in the project.

[quote="zed.emc, post:56, topic:20194"]
If you are interested later, we will make public the backgrounds of all partners. The reason why these social media platforms were established not long ago is due to some special reasons in China.
[/quote]

I am interested! As I listed above, I was able to find a LinkedIn profile for Allen Foo that has over 500+ connections and is listed as being located in Shanghai. If he can do it, I don't know why anyone else couldn't. But, I don't live in China either. You also said (in a round about way) that you have participated in various AMAs on Twitter, which means you have a Twitter profile?

[quote="zed.emc, post:58, topic:20194"]
In addition, initially we named the project KSANA and positioned it as a social metaverse.
[/quote]

This is very confusing to me. So, is Ksana now officially EMC? Because when I go to ksana.io, there is no mention (that I could find) of it converting to a new company? I see the Ksana Twitter account paused it's Tweeting for a few months after November of 2022, and now all it looks like it does is retweet EMC tweets? I'm confused on how the two companies are related? It might benefit you to clarify what is happening to Ksana? From the Ksana white paper, it looks like you generated tokens for Ksana last quarter? Is the Ksana roadmap still valid?

[quote="zed.emc, post:76, topic:20194"]
Only about a few thousand people are currently using it. But chatbox is so promising that it has received funding from EMC.
[/quote]

Is it common to ask for funding from grants/token sales/VC's while building your own project, then give that money to other projects, then ask for more money for your project? The more I read this thread, the more confused I get. That might not be what you're doing, I am definitely confused though.

[quote="zed.emc, post:81, topic:20194"]
In fact, the product has already been launched, but it is too big to be seen.
[/quote]

Congratulations on your launch. I hope my feedback is at least somewhat useful to you in the future and again, I wish you the best of luck!

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-26 06:10:19 UTC | #84

Edit-1

Thanks for the offer. I will test this out and report back in a week on the forum. I don't care about the bounty(ICP/EMC) or AirDrop. 

Any documentation will help. Additionally i will be creating my own documentation; which, if necessary,  you can use.

As you can probably tell, i am not in awe of names....just working code, decent documentation.

How do i post questions? I don't wish to use this forum for EMC questions.  For example, your instructions on https://edgematrix.pro/start don't tell me how to install edge-matrix.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-26 06:31:25 UTC | #85

There are more questions, so I'll try to answer them one by one

First of all, because of Chinese policy, there is no legal support for pure web3, so Chinese developers can't use their real names, which is something any Chinese person knows, but may be difficult for Americans to understand. Alex and Allen are Singaporean nationals, so this is not a problem for them. Secondly, linkedin is forbidden in China, so Chinese developers have no linkedin information unless they work overseas (I tried registering with EMC's Singapore company, but couldn't get through, don't know why).

My twitter: @zedbuho, you can check the ama I participate in, but my English speaking is not good, so basically it's all Chinese ama I took. And twitter is also banned in China, we need to go through vpn to use it, which is very poor, so actually twitter is not our primary tool either.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-26 07:09:16 UTC | #86

Edit-1 
That's fair. I think having an internet identity for different team members and demonstrating sustained communications (over months) in, say, open chat or dscvr might help for folks who need to see individual personalities. 

If you are claiming that we should invest in you/EMC, partially because the team has web2 and web3 experience,  it is natural for us to "trust but verify". Either that comes out in personalities, code commits, whatever. 

I think having translations into English about AMAs is pretty important. While i don't speak Chinese,  through the use of meta's new speech-to-text , it might be possible for me to convert your amas into English. 

Can you post three ideal AMAs that i can convert to English?

MSU means moscow state university , I got M.S. from the Department of Computational Mathematics（BMuK in Russian） in 2002. 

BTW:I don't like the way you talk, for example (in a round about way), it comes across as insincere and why would I want to incriminate myself. If you had preconceived notions from the beginning, why should I prove myself innocent. I am a very strong person and I don't care if you believe me or not. I don't want to emphasize that this is a common American problem, which seems to involve ethnic tensions. So unless you apologize first, I won't continue.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-26 07:36:03 UTC | #89

Hmmm...to be fair,  Alex did invite jwarner to do his diligence and call him if necessary. Jwarner declined that offer. There was no particular motive that i saw in that decline ; except for jwarner's belief.

I think that you're doing yourself a disservice. I feel that you think people are being personal to you and your team. By the tone of jwarner's email, i think that you could have just taken him at his word. He simply believes that Alex might say anything...he wants to use other means to verify. Recognizing that different folks come from different perspectives is pretty important; especially in a diverse community like ICP, IMO

Ok. But what do i do with that information?

jwarner can investigate, I can cooperate or not, but please speak properly, do not be shady

I don't know him, if he wants to gain my respect, please respect me first, don't tell me it's a cultural difference, I believe respect is mutual

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-26 08:15:24 UTC | #93

In my philosophy,  respect cannot be demanded. It must be earned. 

However the issue here is fundamentally different. I think that you feel that jwarner might have insulted you. I don't think that that was his intent. But,  oh well.

The only reason that i am engaging in extending this topic is because i feel that while your team might have something of value to offer to this community,  you are not endearing yourself to this community by the choice of your words. You can choose to use different words to convey the same underlying meaning; without making it personal.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-26 08:18:08 UTC | #94

Maybe I was emotional and  sensitive

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-26 08:30:32 UTC | #95

Cool. 

Fyi I did go over part of an AMA (at least the part of it which was in English). It does sound interesting..."scavenger of GPU power" , i think , is the way Alex put it. I will translate Chinese sections into English at some point to get a more complete picture

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-05-26 09:21:23 UTC | #96

Language can be a barrier, but we entering Web3 is to foster global collaboration within a trust network built on code. That's what I think of ICP (World Computer)

You can read EMC-related articles and AMA content on Mora at: [https://mora.app/planet/qcvry-wyaaa-aaaan-qdn3q-cai]

As a Chinese builder, I believe Web3 is borderless and built by the community from different nations.

By joining ICP, EMC can contribute our influence and developers in the Asia-Pacific community through the ICP Asia-Pacific Alliance. 

Just stay tuned for EMC's AI demos and applications.

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-05-26 09:30:48 UTC | #97

Cool! Thanks for utilizing the EMC API and creating an interesting example. 

Currently, we are working hard to develop a frontend demo that will be accessible to more users and community members. 

Additionally, the Stable Diffusion project, which has a user base of over a hundred thousand, has successfully run the EMC computational model and is ready to be deployed on even more powerful computing nodes, such as 50 GeForce RTX 3090 GPU cards.

I'm bullish on EMC, but it's worth noting that you mentioned 8yearsgang, there are some people in that group who say things with perverse intentions. I don't understand why you mention that group here, which, with all due respect, is only offensive to the majority of the country because of those people

-------------------------

MCLYang | 2023-05-27 00:19:55 UTC | #99

My name is Malcolm, co-founder of ITOKA. We were one of the pioneers in building AI projects on the ICP as early as 2022.(I believe we are older than ICircle in proposing the AIGC concept for NFT). Having been deeply involved in the IC community for years and engaged with the community, I would like to share my perspective as a machine learning algorithm developer who is a true user of EMC 

I first learned about EMC's integration with ICP in March-April through Herbert's Twitter post. Initially, the concept of an L2 solution on ICP didn't immediately catch my attention. Like many others, I believed IC was primarily designed for computation, and I couldn't understand what a dummy is building a layer-2 to slightly boost a 200mph Lambo to 201 :rofl:. However, when I discovered the purpose of EMC, it immediately piqued my interest, and I couldn't wait to learn more about the team behind it. What they were doing aligned perfectly with my own aspirations. Having previously mined Ether using GPUs, which are also used for machine learning training, I wondered if we could leverage Ether miners to train AI models and reward them with tokens. Such an approach would benefit both the crypto and AI communities. Unfortunately, due to my limited knowledge of hardware, I wasn't sure where to start, so I focused my efforts on algorithm development.

In late 2022, when Ethereum 2.0 transitioned to PoS, many miners faced difficulties as the network no longer required extensive GPU resources. Around the same time, ChatGPT emerged and showcased the power of using hundreds of Nvidia A100 GPUs to fuel smart AI applications. The discussion within the crypto space grew increasingly intense, with some individuals abandoning their careers in favor of AI to chase the GPT hype. However, those of us who were already involved in both AI and blockchain quickly realized that merging the two technologies could create a trillion-dollar business opportunity. What was once an aspiration had now become an urgent necessity.

During ETHDenver, I had the opportunity to meet Jan, the CTO of Dfinity, and share my idea about the potential of on-chain AI. I proposed the idea of leveraging GPUs to support parallel computation for AI on ICP and post a new consensus mechanism to replace number guessing in [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ai-and-machine-learning-on-the-ic/14418/74?u=mclyang). Jan encouraged me to give it a try, and I eagerly embraced the challenge. However, as a machine learning engineer, designing a distributed computation network was daunting due to my limited hardware expertise (again).

In summary, building an on-chain AI infrastructure is tremendously challenging and requires individuals with a deep understanding of machine learning systems, distributed computation, blockchain consensus, and a strong drive to achieve this objective. After speaking with Zed, I am confident that his team possesses these qualities and that EMC will effectively address the challenges I have raised.

Zed is an experienced engineer who has developed large-scale applications for enterprises for over a decade. When I shared my concerns about niche aspects of AI, such as how EMC covers inference versus training, he quickly grasped the essence of my concerns and explained them to me clearly. This solidified my belief that EMC, under his leadership, would be a game-changer in addressing these challenges.

Our team is overwhelmed to develop our own music AI algorithm, but I am eagerly awaiting the opportunity to test EMC's testnet and run ITOKA's AI on their network. The ability to make our AI fully on-chain while reducing costs compared to services like AWS is incredibly exciting. Although I am not an investor and cannot assess the potential for a project's financial success, I will be deeply disappointed if EMC fails. I look forward to witnessing the success of this project.

Hello, I would like to say that the individuals who offended you only represent themselves, not the values of 8YearGangDAO. I hope you won't stigmatize 8YearGangDAO. We have been making positive contributions to the IC ecosystem for over two years, and I would like to invite you to learn about [the story of 8YearGangDAO](https://mora.app/planet/kihvw-iaaaa-aaaan-qddaa-cai/7S1C0DZJCMV1C6S2BCDR6VYZNH), thank you

zed.emc | 2023-05-26 10:51:07 UTC | #101

thank you MCL, I sincerely hope EMC can focus on the development, I will not spend time to reply to the community content for the time being. Code is law,  there are dozens of project parties waiting for EMC's computing power. At the same time, I hope ITOKA can be transferred to EMC ASAP.

-------------------------

zire | 2023-05-26 10:57:35 UTC | #102

@icper I was quoting @MillionMiles , who is a leader of an IC community called 8yeargangDAO, because he said something that is worth quoting. Did that offend you or what? 

Which era are we living now? Back to McCarthyism? That's a new low.

Berg | 2023-05-26 11:01:16 UTC | #103

This project has some real ICO 2017 vibes, and not the good performing ones - Elastos, Quarkchain, etc.

Good luck doing it again in 2023 and 2024.

Unless your goal is to tank ICP price further below - this is the best way to do it.

I can understand the position of community leaders who are involved in the due diligence of projects, and I appreciate your contributions, but I would like to propose a perspective: 

Ethereum's huge success lies in the invention of ICO, and we know that ICO has also led to a large number of scams. However, it cannot be denied that there will be a lot of bubbles in the early stages of innovation. I dare to bet that if Ethereum's ICO had to go through due diligence before it could be released, Ethereum would definitely not have succeeded in that year. 

Therefore, my view is that SNS should not go to the other extreme. Setting the threshold for SNS very high is not only disadvantageous for the development of IC's ecosystem, but it may also be a stumbling block that hinders SNS from being widely adopted.

The IC ecosystem is currently too small, not too big. With the requirement for thorough community DD reviews before entry, frankly speaking, given the current competitive state of IC in the industry, it is impossible to achieve substantial growth through the existing SNS mechanism.

For such a good project, the foundation has approved it. I have come to ic to develop mutual achievements. I don't think there is any reason to object. I support it with both hands and feet. Stud is fine. Please speed up the sns proposal.…

The threshold for an SNS is not high. Anyone can launch one on an application subnet by configuring and deploying the WASMS. The bar for SNS that request Community Funds likely should be very very high and include a working product in production, demand from the community to decentralized, audited and/or easily reviewable open source code, Doxed team members, and a clear road map of how funds will be used.

If you don't have these things and you still want an 'official' SNS, you can always set your community fund allocation to 0.  Community members wanting to invest will still grill you on your valuation, but at least they won't suspect you of a money grab from the CF.  My suspicion is that the juice is not worth the squeeze if you aren't getting community funds and/or have a community-demand-driven valuation.

Dear EMC Team,

I wanted to express my gratitude for your efforts in launching SNS. I firmly believe in the ability of any team to launch SNS, and I commend you for taking up the task.

I understand there might be moments of frustration when the community accuses you of fraud, but I encourage you not to let such unfounded allegations detract you from your mission. Always remember to focus on your goals and disregard any baseless FUD.

Keep in mind that Dfinity might request an audit as they have made it clear that they expect projects to conduct code audits prior to launching SNS. Given your status as an L2, it's more likely that your auditing requirements may exceed ours.

I do not concur with many of the assertions made in this context. There's no obligation for you to keep community funding at zero, nor is there any need for apprehension about having a proof of concept (POC). It's important for the ICP community to welcome projects that aren't solely funded by the foundation.

As for the guidelines put forth by Dominic Williams, I believe these can be overlooked. The evidence of their lack of value is clear in the support for a project with zero revenue and perhaps fewer than 100 users. I am confident that even without immediate traction, your project will thrive.

Thanks very much! We are currently establishing the IMN (International Media Nodes) program. Once you have completed the translation, please feel free to share and contact me. As a token of appreciation, the IMN program will provide you with EMC Bounty.

Thanks Malcolm. Being a startup is tough, especially in the speculative world of Web3 where it's even harder to do something meaningful. 

I love the vision that Web3 and DAOs have given us, but sometimes I get frustrated with all the inferior projects overshadowing the good ones. 

I used to work on recommendation algorithms in Web2, and I despise how big Web2 gigantic companies exploit user data and keep users hooked with precise recommendations. 

Data and algorithms should empower people to be more creative. That's where AI and Web3 come in. 

I believe EMC and Itoka are just getting started. The future should be allowing users to participate in AI creation through DAOs and ensuring fair value distribution. 

I think SNS gives every ICP developer a fair and open opportunity to start something amazing, unleashing their boundless creativity through DAOs.
