Hi @zed.emc, I meant no offense. From my experience in Web 3, I don't believe most of what people say on the internet. I really try to live by "Don't trust, verify." which is all I am trying to do here. Americans have a lot of problems, we're definitely not perfect. I apologize if I offended you in some way, that was not my intention.

I'm not sure what I said to get such an angry response, but I think it's fair to leave this here for context. Again, I meant no disrespect. I still wish you luck on your project and will not participate in the thread any longer.

Thanks for your rational analysis and suggestions. As for open-sourcing the code, auditing the contracts, publicizing the team, and outlining the use of funds, all of these will be completed before SNS. We welcome developers to pay attention to EMC and join us in perfecting the vision of AI+Web3! Therefore, ICP is also getting closer to the vision of a World Computer through EMC computing power network and lots of AI applications.

Yes, I agree that SNS financing through CF indeed requires detailed due diligence. But I think both the due diligence process and the professionals who can participate in due diligence need to have corresponding procedures and standards. I think a reasonable process is:

1. The project team posts an SNS application on the forum.
2. NNS commissions nominated neurons or professionals to conduct due diligence, then compiles an evaluation report and publishes it on the forum 
3. Other community members then review the report and ask questions about the project team. 
4. The project team decides whether to submit a proposal based on the evaluation report and community feedback. 
5. Once a proposal is submitted to NNS, the community votes to decide whether to proceed with community financing of the SNS.

The evaluation report should be expressed in quantifiable and intuitive numbers, by scoring different dimensions, community members can clearly see the development status of this project. I once participated in the node election of the EOS chain, the following image is a schematic diagram of the evaluation model provided by the EOS community when evaluating candidate nodes, and I hope it can provide some reference for everyone.

Thanks for the enthusiasm and warmth from the IC community. I have been working in the blockchain industry for many years, and in this industry filled with money, speculation, and impatience, I know that many people come in with ideals and leave with frustration. 

In the Chinese tech community, there is a saying: "Some believe because they see, while others see because they believe." We are seekers and pioneers, and we EMC team will gradually prove the architecture through codes and data. We will not be disheartened by a few words; instead, we aspire to make valuable changes for Web3. 

Lastly, I'm delighted to see such intense discussions within the IC community. In Web3, where token prices dominate the conversations, but IC community approaches each project with great diligence, rigor, and rationality from multiple perspectives such as code, team, data, and applications. 

I believe that IC will provide EMC with a long-term, secure, and diversified environment, while EMC will reward IC with numerous AI developers, AI applications, and users.

As an IC developer and ICP whale, I find the behavior of Dfinity disheartening. The cherry-picking and endorsement of projects for the SNS without even attempting to simulate a minimal level of decentralization is truly disappointing. It is clear that projects are not being held to the same standards.

Despite the impressive technical aspects on the IC, it seems that the individuals involved lack an understanding of web3, as they are blinded by power and their own ambitions.

I'm seriously contemplating leaving the crypto space. üò™

Let the larger market decide. Anyone can launch project. Anyone can raise funds.

NO GATEKEEPING

NO CENTRALIZATION


NO NEURON VOTING. LET THE COMMUNITY VOTE


NEURON VOICE IS NOT COMMUNITY VOTE. 

NEURONS HAVE AGENDA WHICH DOES NOT REFLECT BROADER MARKET SENTIMENT.

I would like to help you understand why @zed.emc reacted so strongly to your comments. Before I do, I want to emphasise that these are my own reading of these interactions based only on my own experience managing a team of employees from contrasting cultural backgrounds; I don't purport to speak for anyone on the EMC team and if I misrepresent anyone involved here including yourself, please tell me so. 

With those disclaimers said, this comes down to the use and unintended misuse of two powerful words: "trust" and "respect". 

@jwarner when you said "I don't trust you" I am almost certain @zed.emc was directly insulted by that phrase. It implied he is not worthy of your trust even though you have never met or that he has taken any action to damage your trust. I believe you did not intend this or understand the strong reaction, and the response was not measured, but here we are.

Also, your clear rejection of the offer for @alxgoh to meet with you in person (virtually) to answer your questions about their EMC project would have been received as a sign of strong and underserved disrespect.

@jwarner it is very clear to me that you have engaged in this discussion with genuine good intentions backing a reasonably blunt and forthright approach to seeking information from a team new to the IC community asking for a highly valued resource (SNS proposal approval & community funds) which you and other highly engaged members of this community are rightfully protective of. 

But to achieve understanding and agreement (or agreeing to disagree) where different language and cultural backgrounds are in play requires an extra effort starting with a reasonable degree of shared trust and respect. The corollary of someone having to earn your trust and respect is that you (maybe) have given them none to begin with. In my experience offer a certain amount of both in advance and being strong enough to maybe bear losing it is a more productive place to start.

If this comes across as lecturing then I sincerely apologize in advance. But I have read this whole thread in significant dismay at how hard it seems to be for so many highly intelligent and engaged people to maintain polite and effective communication when they have all *chosen* a common cause of international scope to be a part of.

You‚Äôre a completely new face to this ecosystem, and have taken offence to people doing their research before voting in favour of giving you 4m$ from the CF.  

So far, all I‚Äôve said critical of your project is that it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôve done your due diligence on ICP to the fullest extent, based on our initial dialogue, in which your team claimed you had to do an SNS, because it was the only way to make an ICRC. 

You‚Äôre welcome to do your due diligence as well, but telling people they have to earn the right to ask you questions won‚Äôt get you very far.

Dfinity did DD on EMC, and you should trust it. Also, many project parties in the IC community are familiar with the EMC team. Don't worry about it, leave me alone, I still have a lot of work to finish, it's 4:00am CST and we are still working overtime. No effort to deal with you.

Gekctek | 2023-05-26 20:14:10 UTC | #128

Is there a way we can structure these conversations to where it can be more of a Q+A or constructive criticism? Ive seen a few of these threads where it falls apart into attacking each other. 
It seems like if there are any non recognized organizations, people get suspicious, for good reason. Maybe dfinity can give an endorsement right away to show that it isn't a 'scam'

Also it seems like one bug concern is the use of the community fund is a hot topic and who should 'qualify' for it. Might make sense to have some consensus on norms for the request of those funds.

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-05-26 21:21:57 UTC | #129

How about we try a reset of this thread and go back to asking a couple of simple but salient questions of the EMC team.

*WHEN*
From the very first paragraph of this thread:

[quote="EMCprotocol, post:1, topic:20194"]
EMC is preparing to launch its SNS DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale expected soon.
This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the EMC SNS and ask the founding team any questions.
[/quote]

Q1: when is"soon"? Next week? Next month? In 2-3 before the EMC Mainnet launches? After mainnet launch?
I think the assumption amongst many posting above is that EMC is rushing to an SNS vote with the expected preparation and milestones. But maybe this thread was intended by the EMC team to introduce the project directly to the core ICP community to prepare the ground for a future SNS proposal submission.
So WHEN seems like an important question.

*HOW*
How does the ICP community want the EMC team to prove its good standing and fidelity in advance of submitting an SNS proposal?
@MillionMiles in [this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-emc-edgematrix-computing-sns-decentralization-sale/20194/115?u=icarus) above  gives a clear and reasonable set of steps to progress this. Others have offered valuable advice above. Dfinity recently released an SNS preparation roadmap. Is the EMC team aware of and these steps and do they understand them? Are any of these conditions too onerous or not applicable? Taking this through a shared process would help I think.

*WHY*
A lot of the distance separating many Community contributors from teams planning and proposing SNS launches seems to come down to this question. Why do they want to do a full SNS launched via NNS vote. 
Some question the need, some question the competence and some question the good motives of SNS launch teams because they are asking for community fund contributions. Some of these challenges put to EMC and previous SNS launch teams are fair and proportionate. Some are overly aggressive and include ad hominem attacks accusing serious projects of being a scam, without evidence to justify those accusations AFAICT.
Frankly it is laughable that any true scammers doing research on using an SNS launch to rugpull would think ICP was an easy target after reading the robust and engaged discussions in this community forums. If they got one past you lot I would eat my hat!

But try to look at this from the outside. Dfinity marketing and promotional efforts emphasise the SNS DAO as a key difference to other blockchains and a reason for existing developer teams and other projects to move ICP. So is it really any suprise that projects arrive here expecting this to be something achievable and even expected of them?


So yes we should challenge and explain and educate newly arrived teams about why an SNS launch may not be the best way for them to proceed, and how to proceed to get the community on board with their plans to launch. Help them find the right path into the ICP ecosystem for their project. But respect the work and commitment they have likely put in before they can here, and their likely good intentions. 

But for the sake of this World Computer project can we please show newcomers some patience and understanding instead of treating them as outsiders undeserving of our respect. 

And if you need a mental reset to achieve this, just remember that for the majority of you reading this, neither you nor I built this magnificent beast of a World Computer. But you know who did? Yes you do, and *they* are respecting *your* membership of this community by not throwing their weight around, although I guess some of them are sorely tempted when reading some of the posts in this forum.

Welcome to the IC! Good to have new projects.

Imo IC is the best L1 you can pick for your L2 network. Congratz on your choice.
Could you tell us how far you are with the Checklist <https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-launch-checklist/19855>

I would also like to learn more about your integration with the IC. 
That tiny arrow isn't very informative.
![image|690x405](upload://sWgXfaN3oqpBDdwGTI0IkWhxot2.jpeg)
I would prefer to see a sequence diagram with canisters & the L2. Otherwise, there is not much to review here.
Your AI tech may be amazing, but you also need to explain how the DAO is going to benefit from it.
Are you transferring all software rights to the DAO?
Can your network decide to disconnect from the IC after spending all funds?
How are you going to cryptographically or legally guarantee that the DAO is going to benefit from that tech? I think you need to bind the whole thing in such a way that you or anyone else can't break that bond. Then having a DAO makes sense. That's why that tiny arrow is not enough for me.

Good luck! I hope you will figure it out

It seems these conversations are turning far more productive and diplomatic.  I'm all for due diligence and intellectually honest conversation, but we can be civilized in the process and we can agree to disagree without making it personal.  It's awesome to see so many newer names joining the conversation and making meaningful contributions in an objective way.

MCLYang | 2023-05-27 01:08:28 UTC | #134

Thank you for your valuable input. regarding the infrastructure at this level. Inspecting all the technical details of a project can be nearly impossible. While some people tend to favor projects backed by well-known venture capitalists or those that have undergone million-dollar audits, it does not guarantee reliability either, as exemplified by instances like LayerZero and Swaprum. Personally, I prefer engaging in direct conversations with project teams to assess their trustworthiness.

First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge EMC's vision, which perfectly aligns with my own vision for true AI+web3 integration. Moreover, I find Zed to be a bold and intelligent entrepreneur, and I have confidence in his ability to build this project. I must admit that I am not well-informed about the recent dilemma within the SNS space, nor do I rely on forecasts to determine a project's success or failure, considering that almost 50% of elite startups from YC, fail. What I see in EMC is a determined team composed of the right individuals.

However, given the established rules within the ecosystem by Dfinity, the EMC team will undoubtedly need to convince and gain the respect of the majority of the IC gangsters to successfully launch the SNS. I have the best wishes for them and eagerly anticipate further developments.

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-05-27 02:22:57 UTC | #135

Thank you @infu and @MCLYang your contributions were great to see this morning (for me) and I hope @zed.emc @alxgoh and @ninadou can reciprocate with some specific answers to your focussed questions. There were many other good questions worth finding in the long thread above that could be answered specifically by your team regarding platform tech and DAO governance that would be well worth replying to. 
Let's keep this on track to educate the ICP community about your team and work and build trust and confidence on both sides of a healthy debate.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2023-05-27 03:15:23 UTC | #136

Despite of EMC team efforts, it looks like the ICP community is still holding back their trust because they haven't been able to fully verify EMC project. It's a tough spot to be in, but it's not a dead end.

Quick question for Dfinity & Dom who has met the EMC team personally & due dilligent of the project. How high is your confidence level to the EMC project ? Does Dfinity have the same confidence level as they are as a seed funder for OpenChat project ? Because simple statement from @zire Herbert Yang "EMC is not a scam", "We have met personally with the team" are still not convincing enough.

Alternatively, EMC could consider not rushing to SNS launch, and instead focus on running the project for some time to earn trust from the ICP community. Building a track record of successful operations and delivering on their promises will help establish credibility and gain the community's confidence

Chloe | 2023-05-27 04:00:35 UTC | #137

After spending some time reading through various posts, I have come to understand the points of contention. Firstly, there are doubts about the authenticity and implementation of the EMC project, as well as concerns that progress has been made too quickly, which seems to be inconsistent with common sense. Secondly, there are questions about whether there are real, substantial demands for AI developers and applications, or whether there is a lack of such demand. Of course, there are also other technical viewpoints that have been discussed.

"Let me say this: voting is a small step, but a big step for the development of AI. We all understand this truth, and we understand it even more deeply in our hearts. Whether it's AI or EMC, they are just the beginning. The arrival of a new era cannot be stopped, and it is up to individuals to choose their own path. I believe that EMC will find the best path for itself. It's like describing the taste and texture of ice cream to someone who has never tasted it before - it's hard to put into words. Some people may find it delicious, while others may find it disgusting. The only way to truly know is to try it for yourself. Perhaps you are better at describing it than anyone else. In Eastern culture, going with the flow and hard work are the answers to why EMC is here and why it has gained momentum."

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-05-27 04:09:29 UTC | #138

Before I sign off for a while, let me share a moment of good humour with everyone in amongst this serious discussion.

I got the chuckles when I read part of your post @MCLYang which you might forgive me for quoting here:

We will gradually disclose relevant codes, contract audits, AI application data, and more based on the pace of the EMC project, feedback from the IC community, and the requirements of SNS. 

We have been an open-source project from the very beginning, but due to certain competition or policy reasons, we need to protect some outstanding developers and builders. 

Through extensive communication with the ICP community at friendly meetups in Hong Kong and the DFINITY Foundation, the development of the Asia-Pacific region and the AI field by ICP are one of the crucial reason for our choice of ICP. The EMC team took the risk of rejecting invitations from other public chains and specifically chose ICP.

Since we have chosen ICP to grow together among public chains, we will not let unfounded remarks affect our progress. At this moment, it is important to respect and believe in those who support us and let the codes influence those who doubt. 

Not only EMC, but ICP, ETH, BTC, and even Tesla have all experienced moments of being misunderstood. That is not important. What matters is that we know who we are, where we want to go, and what changes we want to bring to the entire Web3 ecosystem.

Dear Lachlan,

Nice meeting you here! It was a pleasure to talk over Zoom and share some of our ideas with each othe. 

I am glad to see your rational and international comments on the forum. It is true that the EMC team may not align with the Western and IC community's style in terms of information disclosure, but we are more than willing to engage in discussions with valuable voices and show more codes, data and thoughts.

In the current fast-paced development of AI, the EMC team engages in regular discussions with multiple teams that aspire to enter the AI field. I believe that discussing SNS, EMC, and ICP alone is too narrow of a focus. We should concentrate on how to enable more AI startups to leverage Web3 and computing power to create better products, promote better markets, and win over their own communities/DAOs in a friendly manner.

Currently, the hourly pricing for a 4xA100 system is around $16 for AWS, $13 for Azure(adjusted from monthly rate) and $10 for GCP, and as a result, an OpenAI research piece this January found that the cost of training a large AI model can already range from $3m to $12m, with prices growing at an exponential rate of 0.49 OOM per year, while even smaller models can cost upwards of $80k (http://surl.li/hiszf). At this rate of growth, we project that the less dominant corporations in this ~$120B market(CAGR ~37%) will soon find it financially prohibitive to continue training AI models in this manner, which in turn represents a sizeable block of EMC‚Äôs potential userbase (http://surl.li/hitbg, http://surl.li/hitbi).

What‚Äôs more is inference costs: as a practical case study deployed on EMC for computation requirements, an AI image generation product (showed the early post, Lingchuang) we‚Äôre currently collaborating with has around 5000-6000 DAU at the moment, with 50000+ images being generated daily. They‚Äôre currently looking at 30 V100 or 50 3090 GPU‚Äôs worth of computing resources as they plan for 100k+ new users in the following months. 

On AWS, each regular illustration call costs them about .7 cents to run, amounting to approx. $70000 in inference costs only, bound to scale exponentially with userbase growth. 

So, it's a reason why we need SNS to obtain ICP and EMC liquidity, thus enable these AI developers to enter at a low cost while providing tangible benefits to idle miners. This will undoubtedly promote the prosperity of the entire ICP ecosystem and contribute to the rise in the price of ICP tokens. :rofl: After joining the ICP ecosystem, my friends and I have also started purchasing ICP, so we consider ourselves part of the community as well. :rofl:

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-05-27 04:55:01 UTC | #142

I've been thinking about getting me one of those! My paltry 10 ICP staked for 8 feels too small to qualify myself for one, but then maybe I should take my own advice and be brave enough to commit more.

Hello, whale!

Although I am just a small individual investor in ICP, I have dedicated almost all of my savings and income to the crypto industry and investments. I have also experienced many idealistic but failed projects and beautifully packaged but fraudulent projects. 

However, I still believe in data ownership and production relationships and how crucial they are for the upcoming AI era. 

Despite all the frustrations and disappointments I have faced, I still hold onto hope. Web3 enables humanity to have ownership of their data assets in the AI intelligent world, providing a new direction and path for building new production relationships in the intelligent world. 

Please don't lose hope. Web3, the crypto industry, and steadfast believers and practitioners like us are still here. And now that we have come together in the IC community, let us strive once again for the betterment of the entire Web3 through the breakthrough of AI.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-27 05:07:35 UTC | #144

The reason that EMC attracted me is because of what Alex described as "the scavenger of GPU power". As my other world is in pure AI (mostly inferencing) , i am actutely aware about the costs associated with it. (I run most of the workflows on runpod).

 I think EMC nicely fits with ICP; but I think that implications of AI are going to be much more profound.

In any event, i think it would be very useful to have a functioning website which describes the EMC and how to take it for a spin. I am beginning to create some of the content for this;but i have much to learn about EMC.

Thanks to your openness towards new projects. :slightly_smiling_face:

After comparing several major public chains, we found that ICP is extremely suitable for the EMC project and the AI track in terms of technology, security, and user experience (reverse gas). Therefore, we quickly reached a consensus with the DFINITY Foundation and have been in close communication regarding the compatibility between EMC Layer2 and ICP Layer1. 

After the intense discussion during this SNS, the EMC team has gained more assistance from IC developers, accelerating the integration of the two layers and speeding up the development of Openverse. We are implementing SDKs in multiple languages such as Java, Rust, Python, Go, etc., to enable fast onboarding of more AI developers, including many developers from internet giants like Alibaba. These codes will undergo thorough reviews and audits before the launch of SNS. 

You can find more technical articles and weekly technical updates about EMC on Mora. https://mora.app/planet/qcvry-wyaaa-aaaan-qdn3q-cai/7WJBMKTN7F9FE49EFPDYQTSPXW

Additionally, if you're interested, you're welcome to join the EMC Discord's developer group. https://discord.com/invite/kHkbCydDsA/ Since most EMC developers are from Singapore and China, we are more accustomed to collaborating on platforms like WeChat and Feishu. Therefore, your assistance and participation in the global Discord community are greatly appreciated.

Yes, this post has far surpassed the scope of SNS, discussing the differences between Eastern and Western developer communities, the future of AI and Web3, the inclusiveness of ICP, and the openness of EMC. 

Currently, EMC has established a foundation in Singapore. Although EMC has received invitations from Crypto VCs, we prefer to launch EMC from the community and form our own DAO. Projects like this have tremendous potential and are not controlled by VCs, truly belonging to the open and inclusive Web3. 

We believe that SNS is a good pathway to DAO, so we will continue to gradually disclose information and meet the checklists of SNS, while incorporating code and integrating with ICP to gain the trust from the community.

The skepticism from the IC community is understandable, but some discussions have indeed been a waste of time. As experienced developers who have worked on large-scale user products, we have witnessed the enormous potential that AI brings to the Web3 industry. We are working tirelessly to onboard these soon-to-be-unemployed Web2 developers as quickly as possible.

Technology: https://edgematrix.pro/technology

Ecosystem: https://edgematrix.pro/ecosystem

Openverse: https://edgematrix.pro/openverse

You can continue to learn about the architecture and economic system of EMC on the official website. These architectures have been repeatedly discussed and validated by experts in mathematics, finance, cryptography, large-scale systems, cloud services, entrepreneurs and investors. 

In terms of mining, we have engaged in communication with several ETH and Filecoin mining farms. On the AI front, we are collaborating with numerous AGI startup teams and engineers to refine Openverse. Regarding the tokenomic and IC integration, we are in constant communication with the DFINITY Foundation and more IC developers to enhance the architecture. 

EMC is still evolving and incomplete, and EMC team welcome more participation and contributions from the IC community, then we make ICP become the World Computer together. :grinning:

Hello Nina!

I appreciated the 30min call with you and Alex to answer my questions about EMC network node types and their purpose. It did help me to better understand your technical architecture and Alex gave a good explanation of the project history in the short time we had.
 
Thank you for your detailed explanation of the market opportunity EMC is addressing. The pricing and market numbers with reference links are specific and appear testable by anyone here wanting to understand the AI market opportunity. Evidence-based explanations like this are what I think the ICP community wants and needs to understand and gain confidence in the EMC project.
Taking this same approach to sharing specific details and data to answer community questions about how EMC will integrate with the IC platform and utilise requested community funds after launch would also be appreciated.

> It is true that the EMC team may not align with the Western and IC community‚Äôs style in terms of information disclosure, but we are more than willing to engage in discussions with valuable voices and show more codes, data and thoughts.

I would encourage the EMC team members to actively and positively reconnect with those IC community members who have posed the strongest challenges. With goodwill on both sides of the discussion you may be able to overcome their skepticism and, if not, at least some mutual respect may be established. It is possible to make some of your sharpest critics into your strongest future supporters if you recognise their skepticism comes from a desire to protect the IC project and make it stronger.
Misunderstandings are naturally owned by both sides, it what we do about it thats counts for something.

:rofl:Yes, we are not just idealists; we are also entrepreneurs who want to make money through reliable business models and product technology. Here's another news to share about an ETH mining farm transitioning to AI HPC services: Hut 8 has reported that its HPC business generated approximately $16.9 million in revenue in 2022, accounting for about 11% of its total revenue. This growth was partially driven by AI clients. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/ether-crypto-miners-woo-artificial-intelligence-ai-with-gpu-chips-services?leadSource=uverify%20wall

What will be in place to prevent the following scenario?

during Decay Period(1), while df(1)=1 and p(1)=100%

Reward for computing power user: R(u) = M(tx) * P(n) * df(n) (n ‚â• 1, n ‚àà N)
Reward for computing power provider: R(p) = M(tx) * P(n) * (1-df(n)) (n ‚â• 1, n ‚àà N)

As we see here Users gets 100% transaction cost return. Nodes gets 0%. Same holds true for Decay Period(2).

Node A places excess computing power for sale on marketplace. Then User B(Node A alt ID) purchases this via contract. Once completed the contract is reposted and the process is repeated until 24 hrs have passed. After receiving the daily reward User B then repeats the process again effectively draining the reward pool on a daily basis limited only by the computing power of the node.

This reward pool accounts for 18% of total distribution or 378m EMC. Utilizing the example you provided of a 1000 EMC transaction in DP(4) this would be drained in the first 378k transactions if these transactions occurred within DP(1)or DP(2).

Hello

As a part of creating the technical report on EMC, I am going through the links that you have mentioned in response to my query. I have an extensive background (20+ years) in software , hosting , virtualization etc. I understand that you have no way of verifying my experience. But you will get to see my experience play itself out in my questions and commentary as we go along. You can also see my posts on forum.

I have gone through the document links that you have provided. When the link discusses the sdks, it states "it provides a rich set of...". Since the link talks about the present tense, can you please let me know where these sdks are and what their specs are? Conversely if you don‚Äôt have these sdks just yet, then can you please let me know as well?

I will have some other questions as well. I would rather have a participatory discussion with you and others in the team. However if you think that this might be too much time commitment,  i understand. In either case,  i will include any response or otherwise in my report.

The only SDK on github https://github.com/EMCprotocol/emc_java_sdk states " to work with the [EdgeMatrix](https://www.edgematrix.pro/) Decentralized Computing Network, without the additional overhead of having to write your own integration code for the platform." It is used with MAVEN (build tool for Java). So no idea what they mean with "ÔºàEMC is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls EMC and everyone can take part.Ôºâ!

DunkanMcLoud | 2023-05-29 04:55:22 UTC | #159

When the source code of the node itself is planned to be released open-source? The link you've posted contains only Java SDK for interaction with node. I haven't managed to find any info about it in whitepaper either. Sorry for duplicate, if this question was already answered

cymqqqq | 2023-05-29 06:57:06 UTC | #160

Hi there, so let's just call it deep learning here, and for EMC protocol, I have two main questions here(for myself, about 5 year+ of deep learning experiences):
1. about the data: If your team plan to perform model on-chain training action, how do you input the train data, and where is the data input from? off-chain or on-chain? What kind of data format is it? video or image or txt file? Is it stored on a canister or on centralized server?
2. about the model: If you want to train the model on-chain, is there a plan to open a specific sub-net to run the train model epoch? how do you store the model weights? And to train the large model, there are needs for performing large scale of tensor computations, how do you deal with it?
Above these questions, if you have something(whatever public code or document, please let us know)public, please post a public link here, but not the above java sdk. :grinning:

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-29 07:26:15 UTC | #161

Any quick idea about locally deploying any AI app that provides a Restful API ? Running the edge-matrix node works as described (except the fact that one has no idea what exactly is running since no open source code) tried on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Win11 (flags everything just as it does with any mining software) but have little experience with any AI model, a Rest API using FLASK I can do, just waiting for someone to drop an easy example to continue testing. Thanks

The tokenomic of EMC white paper was designed 6 months ago, and now it is being adjusted according to the mechanism of SNS and suggestions from the community, reducing the voting power of the founding team and EMC Foundation, all for the purpose of being more decentralized, and soon EMC will announce the final adjustment results.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-29 18:39:39 UTC | #164

This is an interim status  (with questions) on where I am with the evaluation of EMC.

I have been doing a deeper dive into EMC to create a "technical report" for the purposes of this community. This technical report is NOT intended to be financial or legal advice.  It is meant for education/entertainment purpose only. With that disclaimer, here is some background about how I intended to do this evaluation. 

## Background
* I understand that certain amount of hype is necessary for the core functionality to be attractive to the community. However, to the extent possible, sticking to the facts makes it easier for an evaluator (like myself) to evaluate. Also I draw the credibility of a source to the extent that that source is credible in statements other than the core functionality.
* I take the whitepaper/ other technical business articles to be authoritative; meaning that they are fair game for detailed scrutiny. 
* I understand that certain jurisdictions have some limitations in context of disclosing real identities and therefore may have difficulties in positively identifying their experience. The best guidance for such folks is to demonstrate their intent and experience through code commits/twitter posts/discord discussions/telegram channels/ Youtube Vlogs etc; all of which is at least partially anonymous
* The Web3 experience means that the teams must be responsive multi channel on a timely basis. The crypto world is 24x7 and therefore the founding team must so responsive.
* The questions are expected to be answered (if they are) in the literal sense. Please don't interpret why I am asking the question. Anyone is free to discard the question as being irrelevant if there are logical arguments for discardation.
* No bounty to be accepted from  the interested team; so that there is NO perception of bias.

## Where am I in my evaluation
* I have gone over this forum topic, the technical whitepaper (https://whitepaper.edgematrix.pro/en/), the website (https://edgematrix.pro/), github(https://github.com/EMCprotocol/)
* I am lurking on their telegram channel as well as the chatbox to figure out the kinds of interactions and responsiveness to queries
** For example, there was warning from someone called Sam to prepare adequately for SNS launch because he was aware about the Sonic thing
** Currently I am not seeing a lot of traction of chatbox. For example if I join DaVinci Diffusion channel, an offer for help is presented through a robot; however when I ask for help, none is offered. 

### Whitepaper Deep Dive Issues
While I am merely pointing out the issues in this update in order to get clarifications, there are also many more positive aspects.

* Product Overview
** More details into how IC figure into the vision as described by the product overview. While there's whole section around Internet Computer Protocol, it is not referenced in the product overview at a sufficient level of high level lingo.
** In an similar line of thought, more forward reference to the EMC Dao is required to explain the overall philosophy of the DAO

* EMC DAO 
** I presume that this is still articulating the vision (as opposed to implementation) of the DAO.
 
* Utility Token of Computing Power
** I presume that the wording, in this section, is **authorative** because it creates an expectation on already distributed EMC tokens through the presales etc. **if my presumption is incorrect , please correct**. 
** The expectation that it creates in the present is "people who hold $EMC can use it to purchase computing resources, and computing nodes can accept $EMC as a payment method for transactions". How can a $EMC holder **currently** purchase computing resources? 

* Tokenology of $EMC
** leaving this alone because of potential rewrite.

* Roadmap
Again I consider this section to be **authoritative**. Specifically I am interested in knowing about the open source EMC Protocol as well as implemented IC Smart Contracts and Client for Node Service. This should be in github with all previous commits (to give the sense of continuity.


## Where I need help
### EMC Team
@EMCprotocol @alxgoh @ninadou 
Please review the commentary above (and previous question) and respond appropriately in a timely fashion .

### Dfinity Team
@diegop @zire 
According to EMC, Dfinity has done it's DD on EMC. Please provide, to the extent possible, what the purpose of that DD was and what was the result of the DD. 

### @MCLYang
I believe that you have been accepted into Paul's incubator fund. Congratulations! Can you please let me know whether you tried to run the service from EMC or are going to try.

### Community
Please add any additional information (or DM me ; if you wish to stay anonymous)

ZackDS | 2023-05-29 18:51:55 UTC | #165

This is all great and all, we thank you for doing it taking your time, as a sidenote did you end up running the edge-matrix node ? I am stuck at the local AI model as in no idea which one to use. Other then that everything seems to work as described also just my 2 cents it all runs on very low resources so not sure why the top of the notch hardware requirements in the whitepaper.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-29 19:12:18 UTC | #166

Thanks @ZackDS for the compliment.

I have NOT tried out the edge-matrix; precisely because i thought i would hit a dead-end (like you did). The only way to get around that is for additional instructions and_or open sourcing the code. Additionally i don't like installing stuff from unknown origin without the source or reasonable assurance that it is free from malaware.

On the top notch requirements for the hardware,  my interpretation in a white paper,  is that is aspirational (i.e. not currently present). However i do note that somewhere EMC claims to have 150 nodes. So i presume, that if correct, then at some of those nodes should be high end. But again, i think that these are recommendations not requirements. IMO  having the ability to consolidate multi-type nodes into a cohesive workload would be a game changer; especially for inference. I can see how @MCLYang is interested in it from a music generation standpoint

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-29 19:22:07 UTC | #167

Yes I stated in a previous post that Windows flags everything just as with any mining software and would be nice to see the code. I had a spare 500GB SSD so I ran it on bare metal both on Win11 and Ubuntu 20.04 just to avoid them saying it was not meant for virtual machines, that would have been way easier. Anyway what I found strange is that they argue they are working 24/7 and have no time to argue but then again with the  https://forum.dfinity.org/t/emc-icp-l2-ai-computing-testnet-launching-nodes-whitelist-recruitment-overfunding-collection/19890/10 post they said "Any PC users can participate in the test network" and when I asked about hardware was referred to the whitepaper so I highly doubt that 100 people did that testing with that criteria. And also 17 days ago "The POC algorithm is doing final environment testing and we will commit to github soon." still nothing to be found.

:slight_smile: 
Sometimes i am guilty of that myself. When my PM asks, "are we done yet?", i ignore for a whole day because i am in the middle of the code. I can imagine how it is to be on the opposite side. I think having a team that can insulate the core-devs is pretty important in Web3.

This seems like a great start to DD on EMC - have recently posted my SNS criteria for similar reasons. Looking forward to the results of your due diligence, thank you for your time in advance!

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-29 19:33:25 UTC | #170

Understandable I just think that if the final ENV testing is running for 17 days now with a huge dev team raises an eyebrow. Time will tell we shall see what they come up with, also @cymqqqq has 2 very good questions I would like to see an attempt of answer to.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-29 19:38:40 UTC | #171

Yes. I have taken note of your SNS criteria and they, for the most part, will be included in the technical report. 

As i am sure you are aware, the purpose of having an participatory discussion is to ensure that we put an interested team in as positive light as possible; while at the same time learning about their perspective and they of ours.

For example,  in this particular team, there appears to be a legitimate fear of disclosing devs real identities due to potential reprisal by the state. In that case, we have to suggest mitigation strategies that can, if provided, accomplish the goal of verifying continuous progress by an accomplished team ; but at the same time accomdate the team.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-30 03:01:34 UTC | #172

@Icdev2dev I am thankful and appreciate to the effort spend on evaluating EMC. While our dev team continue making progress on the development side of the project, I would share more context on other aspect related to organization, operation and where are we heading on the decentralization journey. *Our team members will continue to published and update of source code to Github for further technical evaluation.* 
**Summarising EMC values and what EMC brings to the IC communitites:**
EMC seeks to solve AI computational challenges and global shortage of GPU supply for AI via decentralized computing and blockchain technology. The EMC protocol consists of 2 layers - **Operation layer** provides GPUs computing network (by pooling GPUs from abandoned ETH miners and idle GPUs on FIL miners) built as an L2 network of IC. The EMC protocol handles the task scheduling and task distribution for decentralized GPU computing nodes, optimizing for training AI models and running AI inference. **Control layer** with Ledger, consensus and economic model built on IC canister. IC Canister records the status of the state machine of the EMC operation layer (by optimism rollup to canister every 15-minute interval) and processes all economic transactions using canister smart contracts. 
**EMC expands AI computation capability and flexibility to IC networks**. EMC repurpose GPUs used on hash mining (ETH POW) to power the AI model training and inference will be an Eco-friendly Web3 project and adaptable to ESG. While the IC network supports decentralization of general computing with homogeneous computing nodes, EMC L2 network added thousands of heterogeneous GPUs nodes to fulfill AI on-chain computing needs. EMC network processes and stores large data in Canister (estimated 0.9gb/15 min roll-up interval) lead to significant cycles burned.    
**EMC supports IC ecosystem development (especially in APAC).** EMC adopts a POW mechanism to reward computing node providers (miners) and a POS staking mechanism to reward validator nodes and routing nodes will increase TVL on IC, by converting ETH and FIL miners to EMC nodes provider. EMC will build a Computing marketplace on IC, for users, developers and node providers to trade decentralized computing power. Economic incentives will increase participation of node providers, bringing AI developers into IC, and migrating users from web2 to web3. The Computing Marketplace also provides AI training models + computing power as NFTs (preloaded clusters with TensorFlow, Stable diffusion, Ready to train AI models) and pre-trained AI model NFTs (ready-for-production AI models).
**Tokenization and Decentralization of EMC through SNS.** The EMC founding team are advocates of decentralization, with a vision to build a truly decentralized computing to power the future of AI. EMC built an entire control layer on canister with the economic value of EMC network integrated on IC, SNS is the de facto choice for EMC tokenization and IDO. EMC Foundation was in-corporated in Singapore as an operation body, and EMC SNS as decentralized governance for development and direction of EMC protocol. SNS provides the effective mechanism for EMC decentralized fund raise and establishment of DAO. EMC testnet is live and mainnet target to go live in July-Aug of 2023, which put EMC SNS launch before end of June.
**EMC team is reworking on the tokenomic and distribution** with aim of decentralized governance without centralize control of voting power. What EMC can disclosed, apart from grant from ICP, early individual seeding (1%) and presales of 0.5% token close on 22nd May (600K raised with max 1000 ICP/account), the project started as bootstrap from founding team, and has no VC raised as of this point in time.

-------------------------

alxgoh | 2023-05-30 03:17:04 UTC | #173

@Icdev2dev In responds to your question on the whitepaper:

**Product Development & Developers Tractions**

* Closed the 48hrs presale on 21st May for 0.5% of EMC tokens (coming from the early adopter pool). Presale Data: 12062817.7 EMC (114%) raised ~$600K
* EMC minted 5% of DIP20 tokens for TestNET node staking and rewards (4.5% from ecosystem rewards pool). All DIP20 tokens will be 1:1 with ICRC-1 tokens after EMC SNS launch.
* The Testnet is currently running smoothly and can be verified through POC; participating nodes will be rewarded, total 3M EMCs reward over 60 days.
* Computing power nodes have implemented AI applications to validate the functionality and stability of the EMC network.
* The IC contract has implemented three functions: node registration, reward distribution, and subscription.
* 100+ computing nodes, 7 validation nodes, 10 routing nodes running on testnet.
* EMC source code is open sourced in our Github repository.
* 5 AI project teams are now building on EMC testnet, with two applications integrated into the architecture, scaling deployment of more computing nodes.

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-05-30 03:33:28 UTC | #174

Thanks for the DD by Icdev2dev. This contributes to building trust between the EMC team and the ICP community.

Due to the time zone difference, most of the EMC team is still located in the Asian time zone, which may result in delayed responses. We also have contributors from North America, and we are actively building an international community through the IMN program (International Media Nodes) which we learnt from BanklessDAO. We are also in the process of establishing a North American team to become a truly international ecosystem and community as soon as possible.

Regarding the information gaps, some team members in a semi-public capacity due to certain policy reasons. However, this does not affect the vision, architecture, roadmap, ecosystem, business, or the DAOization of the EMC project. We will release the coupled technical architecture diagram of EMC and ICP, open-source all the code (before the formal SNS proposal), launch a visual AI demo deployed on EMC and ICP, and fully implement the first real AI commercial application. These efforts are actively underway, and we will eventually show the codes.

In terms of team background, we have a founding team with experience in Web2 publicly listed companies, Web3 multi-chain development, mining and node experience in BTC/ETH/Polkadot/Filecoin/Cosmos, professional investors in primary and secondary markets, executives from multinational corporations in the Asia-Pacific region, and architects with expertise in large-scale communication and billion-scale networks. Currently, more developers are joining the EMC ecosystem as full-time or part-time contributors (Openverse, AI applications). These details will gradually be showcased in the upcoming project implementation, developer interviews, and AMA sessions.

If you are interested, you can DD the Ethereum projects I have been involved in, such as Status (https://status.im/), as well as ethfans, DAOONE, and EnlightDAO. These accounts have had a certain level of influence in the WeChat Official Account and Chinese community, advocating for the crypto industry and the Ethereum community.

As long-time builders, developers, investors, and participants in the blockchain industry, we believe that the development of blockchain must be based on the vast external market rather than internal financial games. This is the foundation of our strong belief in the AI+Web3 track. We hope that more people can see this future and join us in exploring and realizing this vision, starting from turning idle Ethereum miners into AI computing power sources.

Lastly, please be patient for a few more days as we gradually reveal the relevant technical details, code, demos, and an updated tokenology that aligns with SNS.

question list:
1
[quote="alxgoh, post:172, topic:20194"]
optimizing for training AI models and running AI inference.
[/quote]
To train deep learning models in a canister or in your operation layer(gpu computer network). Do you mean train models in your gpu cluster and do you use the cuda toolkit(I used cuda toolkit to optimize  the training speed in past years)? And the same point, you run AI inference in a canister or in gpu computing network?
2

[quote="alxgoh, post:172, topic:20194"]
**Control layer** with Ledger, consensus and economic model built on IC canister. IC Canister records the status of the state machine of the EMC operation layer (by optimism rollup to canister every 15-minute interval) and processes all economic transactions using canister smart contracts.
[/quote]

in your words, your canister is used to record the status of the state machine of the EMC operation layer and processes all economic transactions, right? So my question is: what kind of relationship between the optimizing training models and the economic transactions?
3

[quote="alxgoh, post:172, topic:20194"]
The Computing Marketplace also provides AI training models + computing power as NFTs (preloaded clusters with TensorFlow, Stable diffusion, Ready to train AI models) and pre-trained AI model NFTs (ready-for-production AI models).
[/quote]
So what do you mean about "AI training models + computing power as NFTs", NFT-Non-fungible Tokens, in the current standard protocol, an nft is a token id + metadata, right? So, how the computer power(gpu computing network or cuda toolkit) be an nft? how to make the models to be a nft, do you mean to write the model weights or other info about the AI model(images generated by the pre-trained model) into the metadata of nft?
Last question, do you want to build a decentralized huggingface on IC?

@Icdev2dev 
Project Roadmap & Milestones

**Post SNS Launch**

EMC will be handing over control to the newly created EMC SNS DAO, which will decentralize the governance of EMC by distributing the EMC utility token to the wider community. This will raise an endowment to fund the ongoing development and growth of EMC. The development team will provide direction and implement the roadmap, but changes to the system can only be made via an approved SNS proposal voted upon by those who have staked their EMC tokens. The community will be invested in the future of the system through voting rewards, ensuring that approved proposals are in the long-term interest of EMC.

**Q3 2023: Ecosystem Rewards (50% of total token pool)**

EMC tokenology is designed to have 50% of the EMC token ‚ÄúEarned through participation and contribution‚Äù in the EMC economy. The floating of ecosystem rewards pool will be over time (detailed in whitepaper, we will published the estimated floating schedule soon)

The EMC network is transitioning from TestNET to MainNET, using a new algorithm and paying rewards to miners. The addition of miners will increase computing power, and developers can use EMC tokens to purchase network computing power to develop various AI applications. This will further unlock the potential of the ecosystem and attract more end-users to use it.

Empowering community leaders through tokenization to build, promote, and maintain their communities will become crucial to the network. Developer and user rewards can facilitate the building of powerful community-based moderation systems and continually create new application ecosystems. Adoption can be driven by rewarding users for creating AI content and sharing it around. Rewards can be used in various creative ways due to the unique governance of EMC.

The EMC foundation proposed the splitting of ecosystem rewards into:

1. 20% as rewards for node providers through the POW consensus mechanism in a similar manner to BTC mining, with the main objectives being to drive participation and grow the total computing power of the EMC network.
2. 15% as rewards to incentivize computing marketplace trading
3. 10% as developer grants aiming to grow the developer ecosystem and promote AI DApps built on EMC + ICP
4. 5% as voting rewards for the staking of EMC on the SNS

EMC‚Äôs SNS DAO will vote on the proposals submitted for changes on the utilization of ecosystem reward pools.

**Q4 2023: Computing Power Marketplace**

The launch of the computing power market will activate transaction rewards. Computing power as an RWA digital asset will be traded through EMC, ICP, ckBTC, and other tokens. This will further add new financialized digital assets to the Web3 world. Additionally, the opening of financial derivatives trading for computing power (such as computing power futures and computing power collateralization) will attract crypto funds outside of the IC ecosystem. The EMC token is also considering entering public trading on CEX exchanges. The potential listing of EMC on CEX exchanges will also increase its accessibility to a wider audience. EMC marketplace will take trading fee (10%-20% range) to recuparate the ecosystem reward pool (considered "Burned") to balance  the inflationary of the EMC economy.  

**Q1 2024: Openverse SDK for DApp and launch of DApp Store**

The EMC team will work with ecosystem partners to complete the KSANA DApp software framework abstraction into a ready-to-build DApp SDK - we plan to work with Juno.build for SDK integration. Our goal is to transform the AI+Web3 DApp development on IC + EMC into a ready-to-build framework with ‚Äúlego block‚Äù-styled APIs. The Openverse SDK on ICP+EMC is like the iOS SDK for iOS, and can drive a massive influx of Web2 developers into the ICP + EMC ecosystem.

A portion of the developer rewards will be used to incentivize creators to publish high-quality AI applications and training tools on the ‚ÄúDApp Store‚Äù platform, eventually providing users with a plethora of AI applications and training tools that they can use on-demand, utilizing $EMC as the trade token.

Creators can publish their AI applications and training tools on the DApp Store and earn revenue from them. This will provide more opportunities for miners to use the EMC network and increase the network's usage.

Additionally, the DApp Store will provide auditing and evaluation services for applications and tools to ensure that all applications and tools published on the platform are of high quality. This will help establish a reliable decentralized application ecosystem.

Thank you very much for your detailed email. As i have mentioned before, an heterogeneous node "cluster" to serve a unified workload would be a complete game changer. 

I was planning to finish the technical report by the end of this week. However i can push it by a week or so IF we can get the codes for majority of the EMC protocol by that time. This will help further the credibility of the team; given that you might have limited ability to completely disclose identities; for valid reasons. 

You had mentioned 5 AI teams that are already using the platform. Can you make introductions to 2/3 of these AI teams ; so that i can independently reach out to them for their experience of the platform?

Any public , verifiable(even if it is anonymous)use of the platform would also help in my DD.

I look forward to the demos et.al.

alxgoh | 2023-05-30 04:42:10 UTC | #178

@cymqqqq EMC network is decentralize P2P GPUs node, the training model and inference will be running on EMC network (L2), IC nodes currently do not have GPU, and certainly not optimized for AI workload. We will release a detail technical diagram elaborating the interaction of EMC network and ICP canister. NFT smart contract can define assess control, royalties or interoperability and what EMC is building is to define a new NFT asset class associated with computing power (GPU clasters) and assess control to pre-train AI model stored in a canister.
Good question on Huggingface, as EMC try to solve computing power need to train AI model and building a robust ecosystem and incentive for AI developer communitites to build to together, we are anticipating AI developers to upload their data + AI framework (from huggingface) + computing  power (from EMC) to train their model. Marketplace will allow the pre-trained AI model to be traded as NFT.

Ivan | 2023-05-30 05:13:55 UTC | #179

What about powerful models? Will they come under EMC or NNS?

AI framework and AI models are not the same thing. AI framework includes Tensorflow, Pytorch, Jax, etc.
And yes, you can upload or download models from huggingface. But there is no AI framework on huggingface.

ZackDS | 2023-05-30 07:13:04 UTC | #181

OK so TL;DR lot of words mostly useless, nothing concrete just "trust me bro" and the fact that SNS Launch will happen. Also the POST SNS Launch transition from TEST to Main NET using a NEW algo is BS .

@Icdev2dev offered to delay his technical report if the EMC team need more time to publish their source code so maybe some more patience is fair to ask for.

Clearly the team has not been using GitHub repos to develop the code base, only using it to publish now. 

I have just asked about current status of code access n the EMC Discord server and received a prompt answer that included a new repo with another codebase (not yet all of it IIUC): [EMCProtocol-dev](https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/)

I believe it is reasonable to await this progressive release of code and information from the EMC team. What matters is that this information arrives with time for the community to review and discuss before any SNS launch proposal is submitted to the NNS.

EMCprotocol | 2023-05-30 08:31:55 UTC | #183

Thank you very much. We did consider anti-fraud mechanisms during the design phase, but unfortunately, we missed a sentence when writing it into the white paper. This was our mistake and we have now made the necessary revisions. The missing detail is that transaction rewards are based on transaction fees rather than the total transaction amount.

ZackDS | 2023-05-30 08:35:10 UTC | #184

Thanks for responding for them looking at the JS Monorepo (This is project reference ethereumjs-monorepo) just brings up more questions but as you said we have to wait.

-------------------------

EMCprotocol | 2023-05-30 08:38:22 UTC | #185

First of all, thank you for the DD you have done for the community. It must have taken a lot of development time to reply to all the messages on the forum, and at this stage, time is too luxurious for us. If it is not too much trouble, the EMC team will hold an AMA specifically for the IC community, and we would like to invite you and any other community members to participate. We will address all the questions at once. Looking forward to your and others' responses.

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-05-30 08:42:08 UTC | #186

I think that would be an excellent idea especially if members of the EMC code dev team are available to answer some of the more technical questions that are sure to be asked.

Taking a literal interpretation of an obviously off-mark phrase translation seems a bit harsh.
But your point about responding to all the items in the launch checklist is a fair one.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-30 09:19:28 UTC | #190

No one is ignoring you, bro. Why are you so irritable and dissatisfied? I have learned to control my emotions. Since we are planning to arrange an AMA, it is a concentrated way to answer questions. Is it a sin if I cannot reply to you immediately? Of course, I hope that there are many people in the team who can handle external affairs and answer all questions promptly, but there are too many things to deal with. Fairly speaking, EMC is not launching on SNS **tomorrow**. We also want to gather feedback from the community and learn from it, so why can't we have a little patience? It is frustrating to respond to BS like this.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-05-30 09:56:24 UTC | #191

So is https://oregon.edgematrix.xyz/ hosted on AWS? Also what is an example of IDL.json?

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-30 10:04:47 UTC | #192

First of all dear anonymous user we are not BROS.  Second I would choose my translated language more carefully after all you posted so far. Will wait for the AMA.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-30 10:32:14 UTC | #193

 https://oregon.edgematrix.xyz/  is just  testing router for api  example of IDL.json, Of course, you can buy a cloud server to run a node as long as the cost can be covered. If you want to test it yourself, it's best to run a node locally, install an AI application, and switch the Node ID for testing.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-05-30 10:34:12 UTC | #194

thanks bro...oops friend.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-30 15:29:43 UTC | #195

Thanks for the compliment. I can imagine you being streched on time.

Specifically on my two points (and tagging @ninadou @alxgoh ) 

(1) On the open sourcing of the majority of the EMC Protocol. **is it reasonable for your team to check-in into github in 5-7 days from now?**. If not, when? 

(2) Since 5 AI teams are already using the emc platform, could someone from your team provide introductions to 2/3 of the teams so that i can independently reachout to them to gain a feel of their experience on using EMC?

The AMA would be great to have after these two tasks have been completed; so that the community will be able to provide more meaningful feedback.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-30 19:48:06 UTC | #199

This is cool! Just to firm my understanding of this...

One could become a node provider by running a node locally & ultimately get paid for running this node IF other folks use this node for it's compute. 

Obviously used servers(ETH miners) would make the most sense; because the cost has already been amortized and because of global supply of GPU issues. Also some clever LLMs can make use of CPU+GPU; so that again makes sense.

All book keeping,  proof of providing useful compute etc from EMC as layer 2 would be settling in IC as layer 1.

Did i get that right?

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-05-31 02:36:58 UTC | #201

To be fair and consistent this request for moderating interpersonal comments should apply to @zed.emc too.

Way back in this thread, before the discussion degraded, I found this this explanation of the very different environment the EMC Dev team are working under:

[quote="zed.emc, post:85, topic:20194, full:true"]
There are more questions, so I‚Äôll try to answer them one by one

First of all, because of Chinese policy, there is no legal support for pure web3, so Chinese developers can‚Äôt use their real names, which is something any Chinese person knows, but may be difficult for Americans to understand. Alex and Allen are Singaporean nationals, so this is not a problem for them. Secondly, linkedin is forbidden in China, so Chinese developers have no linkedin information unless they work overseas (I tried registering with EMC‚Äôs Singapore company, but couldn‚Äôt get through, don‚Äôt know why).

My twitter: @zedbuho, you can check the ama I participate in, but my English speaking is not good, so basically it‚Äôs all Chinese ama I took. And twitter is also banned in China, we need to go through vpn to use it, which is very poor, so actually twitter is not our primary tool either.
[/quote]

@zed.emc could you explain a little more about how your technical team works given these constraints (unfamiliar to many of us). For example, does EMC team keep shared code repositories on your own servers because of this legal environment rather than "developing in the open"? 

Are there impacts on sharing code on public internet platforms such as GitHub due to PRC export controls such as [cryptographic security technology, artificial intelligence interactive interface technology](https://www.chinalawinsight.com/2020/10/articles/customs-business/revision-of-the-catalogue-of-technologies-prohibited-or-restricted-from-export-of-the-prc/) referred to the last row of the table in section 1 of that linked article?

If this public forum isn't the best place to share specific answers to those questions then maybe DM to @Icdev2dev might assist and more generic statements might be shared here.

For those interested, it is worth reading that whole article. Also the "About" section of that site might be of use to anyone assisting behind the scenes.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-31 06:36:08 UTC | #203

Just to be clear I have nothing against any of these arguments, yes it can be tough for them for sure. But at the same time I am personally working with people from Alibaba wholesale for 10 years now and not only do they speak and write decent English but are able to use apps like Skype, Whatsapp and so forth.  Let's say they are allowed since they work in sales and export. I now have with me here in Budapest someone from Alibaba Cloud who teaches at ELTE Faculty of Informatics and will drop in for the AMA after the EMC team finishes in their time, no rush. Best of luck take your time we the community all want you to succeed.

The web3 project MetaWhale has initiated its collaboration with AngryCat for the second phase of AIGC derivative NFT distribution. The LingChuang AI platform for PC is currently under development.

**Project Name: AI Metafun**
Founders: Barry & Shadow, pioneers combining AIGC and e-commerce
Product Introduction: Currently collaborating with Hashmeta (based in Singapore), providing AI-generated content tools and AI models/applications for verticals such as beauty, maternity, and home life to over 7 million e-commerce platform KOLs. Currently under development.

**Project Name: Earth Open-source Content Generation Platform**
Founder: Shadow, Founder of Mixlab, AIGC Development Alliance
Product Introduction: Earth is an open-source content generation platform that has integrated e-commerce applications such as MetaFun and Audio AI lab. Initial products have entered testing, focusing on audio applications such as music and audiobooks.

**Unbounded Community - Mixlab**
Mixlab is an interdisciplinary organization consisting of over 70,000 designers and engineers. As a next-generation innovation organization, we have designed an incubation mechanism to ensure the integration of inspiration and knowledge from different disciplines, helping members materialize their ideas and drive value innovation. As a content community, we welcome talents from diverse disciplines and advocate for cross-disciplinary collaboration, innovation, open-source, experimentation, and decentralization, providing a conducive environment for startups and individual innovators to kickstart their projects.

We have just open-sourced some AI demos. Prior to the launch of SNS, all voting and governance mechanisms will continue to be iterated and improved, and more codes will gradually be made open-source. 

In terms of AI applications, more and more partners are beginning to integrate, including Metaverse, Crypto Analysis, and others. We are also actively preparing for the AI+Web3 Global Hackathon in July. 

As to AI computing power, EMC has already partnered with several Filecoin miners (sealing machines), and there are several Ethereum miners currently in the process of integration, with thousands of idle 30-series GPUs in their possession.

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-05-31 11:02:39 UTC | #207

Haha, we also have engineers from Alibaba on our team. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown the world that we can transcend national boundaries and collaborate together. Although part of the EMC team is based in China, our work is not limited in any way. The EMC Foundation is in Singapore, and it is inherently global. We hope to leverage our capabilities to integrate Web3 and AI, and expand the markets for ICP and EMC in Asia.

![image|690x393](upload://pQu4ukpHYkDfKulAOJgm94b2jFw.jpeg)

-------------------------

MCLYang | 2023-06-01 06:21:21 UTC | #209

My answer is YES.

In short, the onchain AI approach in our case involves two main steps. Firstly, we design the model and conduct experiments to test the effectiveness of the AI. This initial phase is carried out on our own instance. Secondly, we deploy the AI for production in either the AWS or EMC environment.

Typically, ML developers spend the majority of their time on step 1, which is focused on research and development. Step 2, on the other hand, is more akin to engineering work, involving the deployment of the AI in a production environment.

Currently, we are intensively focused on step 1 as we develop our next vision AI. Additionally, I am considering trying out the EMC network by deploying our previous model to explore the possibilities of combining AI with Web3.0.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-06-01 06:56:43 UTC | #210

Thank you much for your feedback!

 A couple of quick questions: 

since high fidelity music is pretty intense from a load perspective (even at inference time), what are the typical compute power requirements do you see (GPU standpoint)?

What are the differentiating factors that would lead you to consider EMC vs say runpod?

-------------------------

EMCprotocol | 2023-06-01 07:19:11 UTC | #211

EMC Opensource at https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev
Includes node source code, SDK, test cases, etc. Today we will be testing the IC contract reward distribution. If it passes, we will open source the IC contract portion tomorrow.

-------------------------

EMCprotocol | 2023-06-01 07:35:53 UTC | #212

Hi IC community,

Here is the EMC Github source code: https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev. We welcome more developers to follow, audit, and contribute to the codes. We will launch a bounty board around EMC to attract global developers' participation. Interested developers can join the TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY on DiscordÔºàhttps://discord.gg/Y8fPD6BhFVÔºâ and mention @Flash.EMC

1. ### **EMC Computing Power Network**

EMC Protocol is a blockchain and peer-to-peer network-based edge computing protocol that includes features such as smart contracts, decentralized storage, and consensus mechanisms for transaction verification.

**emc_node (** **https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/emc_node****)**

The EMC node is the core protocol of the EMC computing power network. It utilizes the EMC contract based on IC to interact with nodes across the network (validation nodes, intelligent routing nodes, computing power nodes). Using a state machine, it performs task accounting for the EMC Layer, enabling computational scheduling, application deployment, task accounting, and rewards across the EMC network. For more technical details, please refer to: https://edgematrix.pro/technology.

2. ### **Openverse**

Openverse Framework is a web3 dapp development framework built on top of the EMC protocol. It provides a rich set of SDKs and APIs to help developers develop, deploy, and manage applications more easily.

**EMC-RequesterÔºà** **https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/EMC-Requester** **Ôºâ**

Deployment testing for computing power nodes and development testing for AI computing applications.

**emc_java_sdkÔºà** **https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/emc_java_sdk** **Ôºâ**

**edgematrixjs-monorepo-sdkÔºà** **https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/edgematrixjs-monorepo** **Ôºâ**

The above are Java and JS SDKs that developers can use to interact with EMC's computing power network. By selecting suitable computing power nodes, developers can deploy and run their own models and applications. We will gradually release SDK versions in multiple languages, such as Python, Go, Rust, and Motoko. We welcome more developers to contribute and join us.

**EMC-SDÔºà** **https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev/EMC-SD** **Ôºâ**

This AI demo is based on the EMC computing power protocol and is a use case of stable diffusion and its interface is deployed in an IC canister. Developers can use this demo to gain a better understanding of the principles, applications, and scalability of EMC. Currently, there are mature online AI drawing programs running on EMC using this approach, achieving a cost that is 1/10th of the official pricing of cloud services and realizing new green energy solutions.

3. ### Contract Source Codes

The contract source code for EMC network rewards, transactions, and other tokenomic features based on IC (EMC tokenomic) is currently being deployed and audited. It will be gradually open-sourced before the SNS launch.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-06-01 08:24:46 UTC | #213

Thank you for starting the process of open sourcing! I had a look at `emc_node` and it seems that it is built on https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge. So EMC nodes still employ their own consensus protocol (based on https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge) ? Looking forward to having a look at the IC parts or to reading a deeper dive on how this integration works.

-------------------------

MCLYang | 2023-06-01 08:43:08 UTC | #214

Currently, our inference approach involves renting a computational instance on AWS 24/7 (without mentioning the cost of training). However, this approach is very expensive, as I attached by the following costs. 

This is not a scalable option for startups like us who don't have access to millions of dollars in computation credits like OpenAI.

In my pursuit of a more cost-effective solution, I have spent years exploring and searching for alternatives. I came across some P2P services like [Mist](https://mistgpu.com/) and [Vast](https://vast.ai/), but I have concerns about their stability and security compared to AWS. It would be disastrous for us to deploy our product on a random GPU server only to have the service provider disappear or steal our source code.

Like my previous post, I have always wondered if we could leverage abandoned Ethereum PoS GPUs to train AI in an affordable, secure, and stable manner. This is where blockchain and EMC might come into play.

Furthermore, if EMC can offer seamless AI OS management similar to ICP for dapp as an L2 solution, it would be an added benefit for us. I won't delve too deeply into this aspect at the moment.
