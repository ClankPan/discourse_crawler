I wondered how it was even possible to have 35k listeners on a tweet that has only 1337 views?

![image|517x500](upload://htbZxOleT6gVNRfAfU9SX16R8ZT.png)

It’s possible that a lot of users outside Twitter were listening anonymously (not logged in), for which EMC would need to have a much larger following off of Twitter (100k+ probably?).

It also means that Twitter listener count is a very bottable stat.

-------------------------

StofAxeCap | 2023-08-06 04:24:26 UTC | #322

Yes that is correct, people can listen from outside Twitter. 

To obtain 35k viewers would take a massive following from more outlets. It's hard for accounts with 500k+ followers to break 10k listeners, and that's for people hosting consistent updates. Bored Ape doesn't crack 5k listeners... 

Is it possible that EMC is getting 35k listeners, yes, but it's highly unlikely.

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-08-06 04:42:48 UTC | #323

They are misleading people to think that they have huge user base (which they don't). I don't want to use the word SCAM but that's what outside ICP will say. This Blockchain world is brutal and if they are doing same in ETH, they would get doxxed easily and that will end the project right there.

I think this project will not add any value to the community. If yes, they would have already shown signs of brining genuine users. Instead they are buying bots to listen to Twitter Spaces.

I wonder what your explanation is for the unmentioned 10% immediate unlocking of neurons.

and about the controller of neuron not being moved under sns but staying under emc governance.

Considering your BDs statement for plan issuance in multi-chain, I think its rather deceptive behaviour.

-------------------------

ninadou | 2023-08-06 05:04:41 UTC | #325

Failure is not due to lack of community support, the project's vision, or product progress. 

**Why do we persist in combining the AI and Web3 industries?** 
* We are all believers, developers and advocates in blockchain, and we hope to leverage the EMC protocol to unleash the value of computing power (eg. IDC, older ETH and FIL GPU, personal Laptop), bringing AI users and revenue to ICP. 
* The EMC team has been working hard on establishing global nodes, expanding the global AI customers, and actively engaging with AI and Web3 media and community – this is the core of the EMC project itself. 
* On Medium, crypto media [coinmmonk](https://medium.com/coinmonks) reached out to EMC proactively, showing a strong interest in the combination of AI and Web3 in EMC Hub and offering dedicated promotion space. All our efforts and explorations revolve around bringing value, traffic, and liquidity to ICP and Web3.
* You can view the real data on edgematrix [dashboard](https://dashboard.edgematrix.pro/#/) and [documentation](https://manual.edgematrix.pro/emc-network/what-is-emc-and-poc):

![image|690x301](upload://gRKB9N3TZImqBfdxEKUUqHgyd9G.png)


**Why is EMC applying for SNS DAO?**

* Through SNS DAO, EMC will thrive and accelerate AI clients and users for ICP. These AI users can use **ICP and EMC** as utility token to pay for AI applications to generate the content they need (text, images, videos). Of course this will benefit the entire ICP ecosystem. 
* SNS can rapidly aid EMC in becoming a decentralized DAO. Personally, I am the earliest to engage with DAOs in blockchain (I participate and invest in BanklessDAO years ago). A successful blockchain project is inevitably driven by a decentralized participation and governance DAO.
* We very much recognize and appreciate SNS can help EMC's decentralization and governance, and return these value to the entire ICP investors and ecology. 


More and more people are recognizing the performance of the EMC team in **hardware, network, AI applications, and market development**. 

We welcome everyone who's interested or has doubt in EMC can visit EMC [Discord](https://discord.gg/qg6QXBqB7r) and [Telegram](https://t.me/+NGI26KSbBpA3YzA0), we can talk computing nodes, AI business model and global market expansion.


EMC's primary objectives are to develop a high-quality product, expand global market, establish a strong community, bringing more users and token usage of ICP.

If you still have doubts, you are welcome to revisit EMC in six months' time. Thanks!

Do we really need to do this all over again, based on "I see numbers I don't expect so it must be a scam!"


[quote="zire, post:53, topic:20194, full:true"]
@EMCprotocol is not a scam. It’s a legit startup founded by a group of very experienced tech entrepreneurs from China. Members of the current IC community may or may not understand or agree with the way EMC team articulates their vision. That’s all fine and I think the EMC team is open for suggestions and discussions. As @MillionMiles of 8yeargangDAO said, we in the IC community should extend open arms to welcome new players to embrace IC, not to trash them.

While it’s reasonable to perform your own due diligence on an IC project, let me share a few notes about the particular situation in China:

* China has about 7 million developers vs 24 million in the rest of the world. China has the second most number of unicorns in the world after US and is quickly catching up (say, ByteDance). Most of those developers or tech entrepreneurs are NOT on Twitter. Though Twitter seems like the way of life for crypto folks and the only place that matters to prove someone’s presence in crypto, it is not for Chinese. Every popular social media platform, from Facebook, Youtube, Google, Instagram, Reddit, Medium, Discord and Twitter is banned in China. It’s entirely possible that a famous KOL of millions of fans in China only has a puny presence on Twitter. According to [Statista, WeChat is now a top 5 social media global platform with 1.3 billion MAU and Twitter is No. 14 with 556 million MAU](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). I’m not trying to back up any specific number from EMC for them but merely saying that there is a much bigger parallel universe out there beyond the usual Twitter/DFINITY Dev Forum/Discord etc. ICP is uniquely positioned to attract developers from that parallel universe (which has been dominated by Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and ByteDance) and EMC is now trying to bridge to that crowd with its integration to ICP.
* The entire crypto industry is pretty tiny compared to the traditional Web2 space. ICP, if viewed as a decentralized AWS, is the only blockchain that can speak to literally millions of developers who are used to building on AWS/Azure/GCP in kubernetes (and every self-respectable developer is now toying with chatGPT/AIGC). Right now, there is no elegant solution for the crypto industry to reach out to this much bigger cohort, for a variety of reasons that [Signal’s founder Moxie laid out in his famous “My First Impression of Web3” article in Jan 2022 ](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). I’d encourage members of the IC community to be more open-minded and try to help the new kid on the block. Yes, they’re new, but isn’t that what we’re trying to do here, to bring in new blood who shares our vision and audacity? We should cheer for someone who just created an account on this forum recently, not to make that a liability for them.

With this out of way, please go back to your suggestions and feedback to the EMC team on how they can present themselves better in the IC community, engage the community, and earn that trust. Thank you.

We are referring to the AI developers [MixLab](https://twitter.com/EMCprotocol/status/1668609516274073600) and [MCN agency](https://hashmeta.com/) [Hashmeta](https://twitter.com/EMCprotocol/status/1656891820721467398) that EMC has already partnered with. They have a lot of AI developers and kols. We have signed an MOU, and the founder of Mixlab and Hashmeta has also participated in an EMC Twitter Space to share their insights and partnership with EMC. 

In the EMC community, individuals are actively using the EMC Hub and Stable Diffusion page to generate images daily. We are soon going to develop a subscription payment feature for the EMC Hub, utilizing both EMC and ICP tokens. This feature will allow us to display the daily usage data through a dashboard. If you are running an EMC full node, you will also be able to observe **the daily usage** volume firsthand.

Regarding the operational approach on Twitter, if you're interested, you can directly ask the staff in charge of Twitter (he has had trouble registering on the Forum). 

He should have answered this question before: during Twitter Spaces sessions, we will collaborate with some crypto communities and DAOs to guide their users in understanding EMC, with active participation and engagement for the ICP community. Some EMC individual investors have stated that they have gained a renewed understanding of ICP's leading technology and have even become small investors in ICP. 

I have personally been invited to AMAs for other projects as well, and they also have a substantial number of listeners. You can indeed reach out to our Twitter staff and the Asian market team to find out how to acquire users. 

If you don't agree with this marketing approach, it also shouldn't lead to criticizing the EMC team's abilities in **hardware, software, networking, and their contributions to ICP.**

Enabling ICP to be **used by more people** is a crucial goal of the ICP Asia-Pacific Alliance and also aligns with the value that EMC aims to bring to ICP. Why are our capabilities to establish extensive collaborations and acquire potential users being labeled as a scam? 

Is it wrong for any project to do marketing to make more outside people engage in ICP? If there are bots here, you should question Twitter. Like Musk, we also hate Twitter bots. I believe that Twitter's rapid improvements have effectively disable many bots and made it easier for us to gain genuine potential users. 

Through EMC, a significant number of ETH and FIL miners in China, Japan, Singapore have already created ICP wallets and trade. In the future, more AI developers and users will purchase ICP and access computing power of EMC. As an individual investor in ICP, I believe this is something ICP needs.

[Each node](https://dashboard.edgematrix.pro/#/home) on EMC is bind with a real ICP Wallet (Principal ID) to receive EMC reward. You can see there are over 21000 nodes in total and over 3000 daily active nodes.

Out of respect for the community, let me explain one last time. The EMC team partners are all experienced entrepreneurs with successful startup experiences. The product has a large number of users, but most of them are in China and are not web3 users. They don't use Twitter (everyone in China uses WeChat instead). Before each AMA, EMC's operations team will do a lot of promotion on WeChat (trying to avoid web3 vocabulary and only mentioning AI). We believe that it is easier to attract web2 users to indirectly enter web3 through AI. That's also why later AMAs try to use bilingual Chinese and English, because many Chinese users complain about not understanding. This method may not be familiar to you, but it can bring effective traffic.

If you noticed that the number of AMA participants released by EMChub has been low recently, it's because Twitter crashed and we couldn't notify a large number of users in time of the new entry point (if it was a bot, it should not be affected).

I understand that the world of blockchain is cruel and full of deception. But from our position, we have made so much effort and work hard every day, yet we are always accused of fraud. This is a very unfair and frustrating thing. We could completely ignore it because many big neurons have done DD directly with the EMC team and they know us well and have written a lot of content (in fact, I found that most people won't go see it, which is even more frustrating). But I still take time to reply every day because I believe that web3 is a process of preaching, and achieving decentralization requires continuous communication. Every time I get angry, I always tell myself that people will one day understand what EMC is doing. Those who questioned EMC today will also become believers in EMC in the future. This may be transformed into our motivation.

StofAxeCap | 2023-08-06 07:11:51 UTC | #332

I appreciate the response ninadou!

I work in marketing, so when I first see metrics like that it's always my first instinct to associate it with botting tactics. 

I'm in no way criticizing the team for hardware, software, or their contributions to ICP ecosystem. I was only referencing the information I seen on Twitter which led to my assumptions. I even tracked 3rd party apps to find more spaces data. Which surprisingly didn't show any data for your spaces. I use this all the time, very resourceful tool. So yes, this led to my assumption. My apologies!


It's okay to pay for marketing, the IC ecosystem needs much more reach. We can't grow the ecosystem if we don't attract new users! 


I appreciate the EMC team for having interest in building and contributing to the ICP network! Looking forward to seeing the how the team progresses! 

Thanks again, ninadou!

Zed has a background in Computational Mathematics, and my major is cryptography. We both believe the value of blockchain and decetralization more than many people else and hate scams. 

Because of scams, those of us who take risks and venture into this industry often face unwarranted accusations. So we work hard to create a transparent, open, fair, global, and legitimate Web3 business that is not a Ponzi scheme. 

Lastly, I also refer to the promotional content our team wrote for our goal during the early stages: Due to EMC's decentralized nature, future computing power pricing will no longer depend on the credit of centralized institutions, **but on the reliability of mathematics and cryptography.**

Thank you! So delighted to meet a marketing professional on the ICP Forum! Maybe we can collaborate and contribute to making ICP more widely known. 

Your reminder is very valid for us. These operations can lead to misunderstandings, and I will forward to our Twitter colleague. 

Personally, I have also been lead one app with over a hundred million registered users and millions of daily active users. (it's not hard in China :rofl:) So we are trying gradually introducing Asian users to the Web3 and ICP ecosystem through AI Apps.

I am positive about EMC. Facts have proved that a large number of Web2 users in this world do not care about personal privacy and data security, so a large number of dapps are unnecessary for Web2 users. At present, the negative side is that a large number of dapps are trying to profit from the monopolized market, such as HotOrNot, Seers, catalyze and other dapps, and I have little confidence in their success. However, EMC is currently in a track that has not been monopolized. If it can make a very good product, it will naturally introduce many Web2 users to Web3, thus giving vitality to Internet computers. It is stupid to blindly imitate and try to get a share of the monopoly market. So if the EMC team solves the problems raised by Dfinity, then we should support EMC.

icarus | 2023-08-06 12:36:03 UTC | #337

No, the EMC Foundation is incorporated in Singapore (and I know because I checked their public registration records doing my own due diligence on the project) and the EMC project team are based in Singapore and Hong Kong. Singapore has always been a safe and supportive jurisdiction for international business operations large and small. Hong Kong has recently passed legislation supporting genuine business activities based on digital tokens. DFINITY itself has recently set up an office in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is literally the business bridge between China and the rest of the world which is why these special legislation applies so that foreign (ie outside mainland China) businesses can establish operations there to trade goods and services with Chinese companies without having to operate fully within Chinese regulations and law. It has been this way in one form or another for over a century.

So no, they are NOT "operating EMC illegally from China" anymore than DFINITY or hundreds of other American, European and Asian businesses are by operating in Hong Kong. Please DYOR before firing off accusations of illegality.

yangzijiang | 2023-08-06 12:37:56 UTC | #338

I think your question is very disrespectful to the EMC team and a very stupid question. If a decentralized application disappears because the CEO of the EMC team is arrested, then I think he is not the problem of the EMC team, it should be the problem of the Internet computer. For a decentralized project, the project party should not have absolute control, but should be jointly decided by all users participating in the project. This is a decentralized project and IC should guarantee it.

If you’re from China - what guarantee is that you guys will not end up like the Multichain CEO.

You’re operating EMC illegally from China. Your tokens are illegal. Does that make the product extremely risky? What guarantee is for people who invest in the product that you will not get apprehended by the authorities for running a Blockchain?

yangzijiang | 2023-08-06 13:45:00 UTC | #343

In my opinion, IC does not need to be obsessed with comparing itself to AWS. True decentralization is the decentralization of power, not the decentralization of data and privacy. In the computer world, coding is power, and only when the control of code is decentralized can the internet world become beautiful. If we restrict the right to tamper with the code of each project and return power to users, then there is nothing wrong with using AWS. Although there are more fools in the world than wise men, it is very important to give fools the power to vote, so that the internet world can be democratic, free, and prevent monopolies. Of course, for projects, every engineer has the power to participate, and when I want to submit a code with better performance, I should be able to exercise my power.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-08-06 13:57:41 UTC | #344

Right, so do you know the reasons why EMC needs to use IC to create it's decentralized GPU cloud (as opposed to using Etheruem/Arbitrum/Cosmos/Solana)?

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-08-06 15:42:14 UTC | #345

As best as i understood from my conversations with @alxgoh many months ago, it has to do with the vision of storing and processing key operational data elements on IC (such as users, nodes , compute power, provability of compute etc).

As i pointed out at the time, storing actual models would be not feasible on IC because of, primarily, latency.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-08-06 16:10:41 UTC | #346

What follows is NOT legal/financial advice. DYOR. For education/entertainment purpose only.

I have , personally,  seen quite a change in @zed.emc evolution in dealing with IC community in a good way. 

I have had quite a few interactions with @alxgoh , @ninadou and one with zed over zoom, tg etc. 

It seems to me that the community is torn with the potential of EMC (success or scam). Part of this is just disbelief that this is possible. Part of this is how can we trust the developers. Part of this is simply being nit-picky (10% instead of 11% CF)

I believe  that absent the DFINITY vote, the proposal would have passed. IMO objections to EMC proposal by DFINITY were important; but pro-forma (details not quite aligning up with what was stated before, etc). I view this to be extremely encouraging because nowhere (that i can see) is the view that this will never work.

I look forward to the updated proposal.

Well...yeah. What better way is there to get you to do people's research for them? And what a great system it is. if you don't want to learn about something, just call it a 'scam' and wait for everyone to prove you 'wrong' by giving you all the information you were ever looking for. <br />
I find it very telling that projects with just a meme and a roadmap get a better pass than a project full of documentation and code to review. I find EMC to be an exciting project. Due to cheapening costs, it is pretty common for an IOT device to have computational power well in excess of what is required. Turning these excess cycles towards mining (as long as power$$ allows) would be awesome.

I find it sad that certain individuals have resorted to outright lying about EMC, like claiming it's operating illegally in China. The goal seems to be to delay the SNS sale, presumably so they can have more time to accumulate. If this is the kind of crap that developers coming into the ecosystem have to face then I don't expect we'll have many more projects launching on ICP. Hope the parameters are configured properly and everything goes well this time with the SNS.

Anyone that reads the entire post can see that EMC has already been shown to be a legitimate team and that they have worked closely with those of us who have engaged with them since this post began to solve any problems we have pointed out.

Off Topic: I do think what these actions point out is the difference between those of us who look toward the future development of the IC and those interested in safeguarding the Neuron fund for investment only.

This question has been replied to many times
1. the amount of data that needs to be rollup to Layer1 for POC proofs from validation nodes to edge computing nodes in the EMC network is huge, and the tps is very high, reaching 6 million times/day sometime 1 month ago, with more than 4G of data (leading to a memory overflow in IC Canister, and an emergency assistance meeting involving @samuelburri  and 7 others from the Dfinity Foundation,... THANKS), then EMC upgraded the algorithm and got all nodes updated within a week
2. if we want to bring a lot of web2 crowd into EMC, it is better for users to start experiencing AI full on chain without wallet and payment of gas token, which makes the threshold too high.

-------------------------

yangzijiang | 2023-08-07 04:50:07 UTC | #354

Agree with your point of view. But you may not see what I mean. Decentralization and centralization are not contradictory. We need to utilize the blockchain to limit the control over the code, which is what IC can do. In the computer world, code execution power is order, so decentralized code execution power is the core. When what matters is controlled decentralized, it doesn't matter if everything else is centralized.

**Statement by EMC Foundation for Proposal # Enable principal in SNS-W**

We are very grateful to the community and the foundation for pointing out the mistakes and discrepancies in the mechanism design and parameter settings of our SNS proposal - as a result, we can now preemptively avoid any potential future troubles regarding the EMC DAO caused by any unfamiliarities with the SNS initialization. **We appreciate these observations as support and assistance to the EMC project, and it enables the DAO to perform better in the future.**

The issue of canisters not being reflected in the SNS root was due to an error we made during the setup, mistakenly transferring the controllers of these canisters to SNS governance, as can be seen in wdcek-2qaaa-aaaaq-aabaa-cai. We will ensure that such mistakes do not happen again in the future.
* As for the problem of four parameter setting inconsistencies between the Tokenomics Sheet and SNS Initialization Parameters, Tokenomics Sheet and Proposal Payload, and Tokenomics Sheet and Proposal Text, it was an oversight in our proposal modifications (more specifically version control between edits) that led to the discrepancies. We will be more meticulous to prevent this problem from recurring.
* The issue of 10% tokens not matching between the Tokenomics Sheet and proposal arose because the SNS tokens parameter options were limited to the treasury, team, and airdrops, but did not include an allocation for the foundation. As a result, we put a portion of the EMC foundation's tokens under the airdrop category incorrectly. Learning from previous projects on the ICP, we will put the EMC foundation's share of tokens under the treasury parameter.

**We made several serious errors regarding the SNS process due to lack of knowledge regarding the SNS project and internal workflow issues; this will not happen again.**

---

**We have also taken in input from the community to simplify the tokenomics design to more clearly reflect the decentralization of voting power and compensation made to the early investors, participants and contributors of the EMC Testnet based on the DIP20 -> ICRC-1 compensation proposal.** As such, the following adjustments have been made:

1. Compensation tokens have been allocated as an additional airdrop pool based on the 15m DIP20 tokens and the corresponding 52m ICRC-1 tokens needed (max. value, this is assuming EMC only hits the minimum target with the SNS). As a commitment to EMC community, the founding team decided to contribute an additional 5% from the founding team pool to the airdrop pool.
2. The founding team's share of tokens has changed **from 15% to 10%**. If a neuron has a "vesting period" it cannot be touched until the period is over (and that includes increasing the dissolve delay). This ensures that the founders cannot rug-pull investors and provides an ongoing incentive to make EMC successful. As these founder neurons all have a relatively short dissolve delay of 1 month which cannot be increased, this ensures a much-reduced voting power compared to the community so that governance is properly decentralized.
3. We have learned from the HotorNot proposal regarding their foundation setup and allocated all of the EMC foundation's tokens (15% of total tokens) to the treasury pool reserve. Factoring in all of this, the SNS DAO will control 73% of the total EMC token pool. Of this amount, 21% will be allocated to the non-profit EMC Foundation, which will develop and manage the EMC protocol and platform. From this 21%, 6% of total tokens are reserved for future investors to fund the project.

**The EMC Foundation has been incorporated in Singapore. The tokens allocated to the Foundation would be earmarked for the following:**

1. Rewards for Global Partner Program of EMC foundation (~5%)
2. Reserved for future investor and funding needs for the project (~6%)
3. Reserved for future development activities (~10%)

This adds up to the 21% of the total EMC token pool held by the foundation.

Less than 33% of the total amount of tokens allocated to the Foundation will be staked for voting to allow the foundation to participate in the governance of the platform - these tokens will all come from the 10% reserved for future development activities.

**We have been discussing and integrating feedback from both the community and the DFINITY foundation to improve and strengthen the foundations of the EMC DAO.** Now, EMC is attempting to restart the SNS process, indicating that we need to re-initiate the creation process of the SNS from scratch. This involves submitting a first proposal, installing and initializing new SNS canisters, and then submitting the second proposal for the SNS swap.

With the assistance and feedback from the IC community and the DFINITY Foundation team, we have made the necessary changes to the SNS parameters to address the concerns raised by the community, and after a thorough internal review regarding our errors in the last proposal, we ensure that mistakes like these will not happen again in the future.

It's great to see your response on the IC Forum. :grinning:

I have nearly 10 years of experience in Web2 + Web3. From altcoins to DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse, I've been constantly pondering what kind of Web3 applications (killer dapps) beyond financial use cases could achieve **massive user adoption**. 

With the progress of the EMC project, I've come to believe that AI may be a prime domain to ignite Web3 traffic.

1. AI has already demonstrated its rapid growth and monetization potential.
2. AGI remains an untapped market, where a well-performing AI model could quickly amass a large user base. Currently, the EMC team has engaged with numerous AI developers involved in generating product images, storybooks, and digital avatar videos worldwide. Currently, these developers face several challenges:

* They are hindered by the high **training costs** (at least V100 GPUs)
* They struggle with the expensive **inference costs** incurred during user acquisition
* They are eager to share AI model values through AI Model NFTs to swiftly gain a global user base. 

Moreover, we have been collaborated with leading global ETH and FIL miners who possess a surplus of **idle GPUs (3060, 3080, 3090)**. These GPUs remain inactive at present, but they could be cost-effectively supplied to AI developers. In turn, miners could receive tokens and anticipate growth returns. 

Therefore, I resonate strongly with your perspective. While we can't allow Web3 to break the monopolize Web2 market, we should recognize the vast untapped potential of the **AGI-driven new market**. It's a blank area waiting for team with strong belief, foresight and action to explore such like EMC :grimacing:

May I ask "Yangzijiang" does indeed represent the Yangtze River? I'm living beside it. :wink:

WebGPU is a very important upcoming web technology. By default, graphical calculations in a browser window are handled by the processor; which cannot perform matrix calculations fast enough for 3d rendering. But now, we have standards (WebXR) and libraries (ThreeJS), which allow for The browser to offload graphical computations to devices which are better suited. <br />
With WebGPU: an application can directly access the underlying graphics card, and get it to perform whatever computations it wants (i.e. mining). A properly decentralized application could generate some massive computing power.

Anthony, this is gone too far. You shall not compare EMC to Multichain. 

I am a Chinese American who used to live in Palo Alto and currently living in Shanghai. If you're a startup founder or investor in Silicon Valley, what guarantee do you have that you will not end up being stabbed to death in the street of San Francisco? How would you answer to your fellow co-founders or portfolio founders then? 

Of course, this is not meant to be a real question because it's not fair to impose this burden of proof on you vs Bob Lee. Multicoin's case has been covered and discussed extensively in the Chinese crypto circle, but discussing that is beyond the scope of this forum. I suggest we stay on course and discuss what's relevant for IC and EMC. Nobody has the right to impose the burden of proof on anyone on this forum that is unrelated to their development in IC. You're going down a dangerous path that is creating a very toxic environment for IC.

While we're at it, SNS is actually the solution to a very prevalent industry-wide problem right now. That is, the founders always hold the private key or root access to the vault/product. Both the Multicoin case and the brutal murder in Bali, Indonesia demonstrated the risk of this tight coupling. When an IC project like EMC adopts SNS, the EMC DAO consisting of (eventually) ICP holders will take ownership of the EMC app and data (assuming the canisters are configured correctly, which is something a tech team needs to verify), so founders are de-coupled from the product and the risk that a product will be hijacked by coercive force will be reduced significantly. That's the power of decentralization that SNS could potentially bring.

Doesn't this show that EMC has full control of tokens and is not decentralized? How is airdrop being done and how can you ensure that is even fair? How do we know where that airdrop is even going. Who decides what lists of accounts get the tokens? I don't think that should count toward decentralization. From here is shows that the network is not decentralized. Prove me wrong.

It just seems like we are repeating SNS-1.

Also staking time and amount is irrelevant. Tokens held is the source of truth. Outside that token holders can just change delay and then take over SNS.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-08 10:59:44 UTC | #369

Of course you are wrong, please don't misuse words like FULL CONTROL. How is it not decentralized when 52% of the eco rewards are contractually issued? If you ask about the airdrop portion, how can it be called complete when at most 7% of the portion is questioned?After SNS, all the airdrop portions have to initiate a vote, for example, the addresses that participated in presale early on hand out the airdrops, how is this process not decentralized. How about you go look at KINIC or HoN for airdrops? You don't have to do that if you're blowing off steam all day, simply vote NO and be on your way, if you have neurons.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-08 11:08:25 UTC | #370

SNS wouldn't be a perfect system, the program needs to be set up according to SNS parameters, have you gone through the SNS process? If you have a hammer in your hand, you can only see nails in your eyes. Even assuming the EMC is guilty, you won't gain anything, and you won't be able to influence anyone's independent judgment. So, I suggest you propose to refine the SNS more, maybe that's more beneficial.

So will you blackhole that canister that sets the treasury that distributes the rewards? Would be nice to have those tokens reward of 420 million tokens in a canister that is blackholed and not under the control of SNS. If that is done then those tokens are really decentralized since they cannot be revoked by a simple majority holder of the SNS, which for a while will be EMC. Le'ts not pretend.

Do you really not understand or are you pretending not to understand? All canister contracts have to be handed over to the SNS root before open swap, and all later modifications have to be voted on by SNS, if you don't understand that, please go learn about SNS, if you understand it and still say that, then you're not only stupid but also bad.

My questions about a mere risk where taken into consideration as if I am FUDing your project. 
I am an investor, and just like a traditional business, I have questions and concerns when I see the risk. 

If you think that asking for risk is toxic, then maybe you do not belong in this industry. **These guys are Chinese citizens living in HK and raising funds from US citizens. What could go wrong?** Two days ago Chinese authorities arrested a blockchain founder who was living abroad operating his exchange. He went back to China and got arrested.

The only reason this team is getting NO votes is because of how you treat the community. The founder replies like he is the only one know is knowledgeable in this whole world and has a bunch of paid supporters who back him up. 

lower your arrogance and come down to earth and speak with your community with open ears and clear eyes maybe you will understand who you are dealing with.

The definition of a community is about people interacting and driving the group forward, with the same purpose. Obviously from time to time there comes someone who does not agree and try to push an agenda forward that suits their needs like EMC is doing right now. The forum is here for a reason. Matter of fact is that EMC has nothing and by that I mean 0 , zero to do with the IC . You can call it L2 and any other AI bullshit it is just a pile of forked code that is worth absolutely nothing, we can call it whatever at this time there is nothing worth for SNS. Next thing is that for sure it is not a scam and it deserves the benefit of doubt just like any other project. Buying bots and doing shady things that any sane person can clearly see and than bitch about it and attacking people for pointing out flaws is not the way to go. There is some potential for this project and maybe if they can work with the community they may end up getting somewhere but for now they are worthless.

-------------------------

Slice_Info | 2023-08-09 01:21:01 UTC | #385

In the end, Only dfinity knows the right thing to do. To filter through the chaos and noise to make the decision that suits the community. Right now, the talk has gone beyond rational-- It's mostly emotional and personal. I believe EMC has shown all the facts there is and the community has seen. The community may now go ahead and make the decision. I personally vote EMC because it's the only thing in ICP that isn't a direct copy of web2. I'm excited to see where it ends and what it brings to the protocol.

I don't know where you get your anger from. It seems like you have never had anyone critique you in your life. We are just voices here, nothing more nothing less. We love Dfinity and the vision Dom + Team set for the Internet Computer. It has actually surprised me how negative this thread has gotten. First time this has happened with my interactions on this forum. We each have our own values and are free to express ourselves. At times this leads into conflict with people like yourself but I will never resort to name calling. We just want what we think is best for the ecosystem. I don't think we have any ill will. I personally don't have any ill will toward EMC. I am just holding it to a standard of what I would like to see.

And yes I do love dogs.

Not sure why you are so negative.

I totally understand why people are reluctant to answer positively to your new NNS intent, not even a week after the opposition you received last week. How about not rushing it and make the steps the more diligently possible, instead of resending the next intent the following day ? Dont you think it shows quite some project and tokenomics immaturity if the number you provide arent accurate ? Maturity doesnt evolve within 24h, nor in a project structure, nor with the interaction and view from your community ( even tho you give openly rewards for people shilling your project )

Look at the bright side, so many NNS are happening right now and market conditions arent so great.

You will probably be much more successful with better market conditions, and have a more mature product in a few months to reach your goal. I do not think anyone in here has bad intentions and if people are studying and analysing this project so much, is because they have great expectations and they should be thanked to point weakness in this project since they will be also the first one to support you once they will be answered.

Instead you dont seem to answer them respectfully.

zed.emc | 2023-08-09 10:16:22 UTC | #392

old dog means someone who thinks they've been occupying resources for a long time . I love dog too.
You guys are always assuming people are jumping to conclusions and that's what pisses me off. I've never refused to criticize, but to accept it respectfully in the face of planted evidence is not the right way to go about it, and the accusations from the beginning to now are all figments of your imagination that are neither proven nor logical. We tried our best to explain, but it seems that this situation is getting worse and worse, with terms like Chinese citizen and American citizen both appearing in a web3 community, racism is exposed. The purpose of decentralization is not to be free to accuse others without accountability, and hiding your intentions by saying "We are just voices here, nothing more nothing less." doesn't make you any more noble.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-09 10:29:05 UTC | #393

So I asked GPT-4 what it means in China and it said: 

```
In Chinese culture, calling someone an "old dog" (老狗) can be considered disrespectful. 
It's akin to belittling someone by referencing their age or suggesting they are outdated or obstinate. 
```
So I guess AI is wrong as well. But I trust that you had the best intentions with saying that to us. 

[quote="zed.emc, post:392, topic:20194"]

You are a rational questioner, and I am willing to answer your questions:
First of all, there is no problem with EMC's token economics (if you read the whitepaper carefully, you should know that there are a lot of new ideas in it), what is problematic is the mechanism of SNS, which was originally designed for dapp, not Infra, and EMC's mistake is not a design problem with tokenlogy, but rather a problem with checking into SNS's parameters, which is only a few hours of checking work It's just a few hours of checking work.
I've experienced far more failures and frustrations than the average person, and created just as many accomplishments. I'm not going to get upset over some well-intentioned accusations (your query, for example, seems like a well-intentioned reminder to me), my dissatisfaction comes from the unfairness of the situation here, and I can cite plenty of evidence for that:
1. the EMC incorrectly transferred canister control to governance instead of root (we submitted it, it was just the wrong mention), and modClub didn't submit it at all (how did dfinity check it, we just double-checked it), which is why modClub re-initiated the first round before the second round of voting was over. If the EMC shouldn't have re-voted on the third day, what's the deal with modClub being within 24 hours? **And as you can see, Dfinity immediately led the first 4 neurons to vote YES. is this double standard, is this unfair.**

I am not sure I understand what you mean, instead of re-voted* you meant re-initiated the SNS intent ?

As far as I know there are no rules about it. Besides, my explanation was not talking about rules* but change in point of view from voters to shift their no to a yes ( ModClub did not get a no in an unbugged finished voting while expecting a yes few days later )

I mean the reason EMC was rejected by Dfinity at the last minute in the second round of voting was because of a setup issue with the SNS initialization, but since that setup can't be rolled back, we're willing to accept the error and restart the voting from the first round. modClub was the same issue, and was even more eager to restart the voting than EMC was, so why is the community harshly blaming EMC for this? the exact same situation that resulted in the is the opposite, Dfinity's voting attitude says it all, this is a centrally controlled community.

Hi Team. You guys are not to blame.There is a reason for this.
NNS gave neuron funds to degraded Web2 apps such as Catalyze, Modclub and Hotnot, and continued to give gifts to empty projects like Ghost and Boom DAO.Also, I plan to give money to Seers who repeat the problem recently.

I'm sorry. We distributed too much money to trusted friends and the money we gave to engineers was empty.But this is DAO's choice.

Isn't there freedom of speech here? Doesn't everyone have their own values? I conclude from your words that it is MANIPULATING OTHER PEOPLE'S WORDS, and you conclude that it is VOICES FROM THE COMMUNITY. And you know what I see? Hypocrisy and arrogance.

This is going really well. I'm so glad that the community is voting NO to this project. The founder is clearly never received any negative reviews in his life. Arrogant and already saying he is leaving ICP because no one gave him candy. 

1. Other projects are here for a while. We know them and we trust them. 

2. Even in real life, if someone asks for money you don't give them just like that. You can lend to people who you know for some periods of time without hesitation. You're a stranger and you need to build community with confidence and patience. 

3. Your project failed because of the way you're responding to community. 

4. You are saying that Devs are here because they are stuck due to the price of ICP? Genius. 

5. If we are bunch of losers, then why are you asking for funds from us? 

6. Dominic has shilled many things. Even bad NFT projects. It's Twitter and people do all kinds of things. Not a testament and no one cares of Doms tweet. 

7. I cannot imagine if your proposal goes through at this point because I'm sure you gonna runaway with it. 


If you're such a big dev and hero, stay and code. Show us what you got. You are not SNS ready. We need founders who can take things positively and work and improve their project.

If you say this logic, sns is over, completely out of the spirit of blockchain…

 Completely out of the original intention of dfinity construction, IC needs to judge whether it is sns based on human experience, right?

Hi, this is not correct, our SNS was configured correctly. The dapps vector was populated with our canister ids but due to a bug in the SNS the fallback occurred and our SNS was put into an invalid state. We have to restart the process again because of this, through no fault of our own. 

You can follow the technical explanation in Dfinity's post as to why the dApps vector is empty.

[Microsoft just announced they are planning on using Aptos to train their AI models.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/09/microsoft-aptos-blockchain-ai-web3/) Do you know if EMC could work on Aptos?

I mean no offence, but if by "Other projects" you mean the Web2 copied projects, wish you all the best.

ericyuan1024 | 2023-08-09 17:00:07 UTC | #418

why don't you just re-do the handing over control to SNS root.

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-08-09 17:12:59 UTC | #419

From our discussion with Dfinity, this would not fix the issue. Once our SNS was put into an invalid state it could not be changed back.

What is the vesting period?

Also where can I see the yaml file sns?

@Antony you have to right and freedom of speech, but if you claim yourself as investor, your comment will be more welcomed if you complete your due diligence before making any claim. If you vote No simply because you just don’t like/trust EMC just keep this to yourself and you don’t represent other hence grammatical don’t misrepresent with WE. And any comments from Zed is referring to You, Antony personally as you don’t represent the community.

As co-founder of EMC, I and highlighting the facts: 
1. EMC Foundation was incorporated in Singapore and governed by Singapore law as a non-profit public organization (refer to ACRA website). I am native Singaporean and chairing the foundation, support by our Legal partner YDZHAO who hold legal certification from US and China. EMC structural design is in compliance with Singapore, HK and China local regulation. Zed as CEO is leading our development team who is based in China, while the operation of EMC protocol is Global and outside of China.

2. This 400 forum threads, give insights on how we have interacted, taking constructive feedback and coming back with better resolution. I don’t agree with you point of “Your project fail”, against this is misleading and falsify claim.

We need to focus on constructive feedback and productive conversations that can help ICP ecosystem to grow and EMC as community project to develop. As EMC continue to grow we admit the mistake we have made and most important we dare to accept the challenge, rectify our mistake and come back with better proposal that drive the project toward success.

It is important to have trust from the foundation and community as we continue to build. During meetings with Dfinity, we have made it clear that this is big decision to build EMC economy, consensus and verifiable datas on IC canister, if we do not secure the support from foundation, way need to reconsider EMC tech stack. The noises from forum will certainly be filtered and constructive feedback will be taken. We have setup a meeting with Dfinity team to discuss and align on EMC strategy.

You seem like a more reasonable person and thank you for engaging in a constructive way. 

Do you know where I can find the yml file for SNS?

Thanks

will be disclosed before OpenSnsTokenSwap proposal on github.
But you can refer to tokenomics [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11nhpQ-FD5Mvmi-PMplouS3x2KHqBbfpfqEu145W_VxU/edit)

Let me restore what happened:
ModClub initiated multiple second votes (which in hindsight should have been a bug in SNS) and control of canister was not handed over to SNS root (modClub email note was due to the release of control after redundant proposals were rejected, not a lack of handover), which I thought was logical, and  I saw "what I thought were facts" and made an incorrect judgment, I would like to apologize for misunderstanding the @modclub team.

-------------------------

zed.emc | 2023-08-10 05:55:23 UTC | #427

Also, I will not be responding to any questions outside of technical or system design of EMC in the forums

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-08-10 06:25:12 UTC | #428

Here is a technical / system design question. You say in your current live proposal : 
" The following 5 Dapp canisters (same applications as last submission but redeployed in new canisters) will be directly controlled by the SNS.

* Official Website: 2heg6-2aaaa-aaaap-qbl3q-cai
* EMC Node dashboard: 2afak-xyaaa-aaaap-qbl3a-cai
* EMC Hub: 2jglw-bqaaa-aaaap-qbl2q-cai
* EMC Requester of Computing Nodes: 23a4p-naaaa-aaaap-qblzq-cai
* EMC Stable Diffusion: 2ohnc-miaaa-aaaap-qbl2a-cai

The following 3 Asset canisters won't be handed over since they've been handed over to the governance canister within last submission. And they are planned to be replaced with official ICRC-1 EMC token and corresponding new canisters after SNS launch ASAP.

* DIP20 Token: aeex5-aqaaa-aaaam-abm3q-cai
* EMC PreSale: bvojc-yyaaa-aaaam-abm6a-cai
* EMC Node Reward: nk6pr-3qaaa-aaaam-abnrq-cai "

1. Why NOT replace with the official ICRC-1 and corresponded canisters BEFORE the SNS launch since AND THIS is your words you will do it right AFTER ? 
Do you not have the time being busy in the forum ? 

2. Why are you NOT showing the YAML configuration file ?  as per 1.4 in the : 
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-launch-checklist/19855#h-14-create-sns-configuration-file-5

Thanks
