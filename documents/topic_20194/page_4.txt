Why no do this before submitting the controversial proposal ? 

Thank you.

What's the point of changing it before swap? icrc-1 is distributed by SNS, you can't bring your own icrc-1 into SNS! (currently EMC can consider that there is no mainnet token), there is only DIP20 token .Once the ICRC-1 token is generated, we will create a contract for DIP20 and ICRC-1 exchange, and the eco-reward contract will be updated to directly issue ICRC-1 token, and the DIP20 token will no longer be used. Yes, this will be implemented immediately after SNS.

The YAML file will be updated by tomorrow, which involves several changes:
The team has been reduced from 15% to 10% for reasons previously discussed
EMC Foundation section, previously incorrectly placed in the Airdrop section, adjusted to Treasury etc
All specifications will be filled and checked strictly according to the form provided by dfinity, and a test network for SNS has been built, engineers will run the testflight test before submitting, we don't want to make any more mistakes.

This is not an answer. I know why you would do it ONLY after, you know it, anyone with some basic knowledge on how the SNS works knows it. BUT I will leave it be for now. Will do a live AMA about current state of the SNS and why everything is wrong with your proposal. Obviously you can't be trusted not to bot and DDOS the event and also anyone who read this thread has a well formed opinion about you as a person so anything you promise to do after the SNS is a good old "trust me bro" . Will keep you updated.

Hi Zack, I would like to know what's your suggestion in specific. 
EMC launched "testing" on ICP in early May with the early node participants. And EMC(DIP20) was introduced as a temporary token for node reward and presale. As the "testing" going, more and more node participants created their wallets on ICP and get EMC(DIP20) rewards. The "official ICRC-1 EMC token" refers the ledger canister deployed with EMC SNS canisters along with root, governance, index and swap etc. 
So do you think  is it really necessary to introduce another temporary ICRC-1 token before SNS? 
Or is it proper to operate tokens in treasury before the SNS get decentralized successfully by passing OpenPublicSwap proposal and match the fund raise target?
Or am I getting you wrong?

Thanks, and BTW welcome to find EMC on twitter and talk more efficiently.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-11 03:16:52 UTC | #434

So right now you are using `DIP20` canister to reward miners that you have full control over correct? It is not decentralized. 

You are setting up a treasury with SNS that will be used as the official way to reward miners correct?

How will you automate that? 

Will you at some point transfer burn the DIP20 tokens for treasury tokens? The reward system doesn't seem like it is very clear to understand. It seems like it is still in design review.

Regardless at how it happens, I will just like to review the SNS file. I mean you should pay someone to do an audit of the reward system. Same goes with any project.

-------------------------

ericyuan1024 | 2023-08-11 21:53:13 UTC | #435

1. The DIP20 canister, presale canister and node reward canister had been handed over to SNS that EMC created at the first attempting of decentralizing. We did not get the control back after the decentralizing failed because the canisters be inadvertently handed over to sns_governance which should be sns_root. Although EMC lost control of these 3 canisters, but they are working properly for now.
2. If the second attempt of SNS succeed, we will deploy new canisters based on the official ICRC-1 Token. And stake holders of EMC should vote on proposals on registering new canisters, deposit EMC(ICRC-1) to new NodeReward canister, and canister upgrading etc. I thinks that's "EMC managed by DAO based on SNS" means.
At least 2 sets of canisters will be introduced: NodeReward canister(s) with official ICRC-1 token and canister(s) for EMC(DIP20) swapping to EMC(ICRC-1).
3. The reward system indeed is complex and some adjustments have to be done after SNS:
    -switch from DIP20 to ICRC-1
    -EMC node participants been required to stake EMC(DIP20) before and they will be required to hold enough EMC(nueron) after.
    -switch reward plan from Testing to Production
4. I believe the EMC Foundation team has the plan of providing grants for reviewing, auditing and contributing on the EMC protocol further development. But as far as I know EMC(ICRC-1) is preferred than EMC(DIP20) for the grants.
5. SNS yaml file will be disclosed by EMC account with tokenomic sheet and necessary explanations SOON.

@cyberowl  Thanks for your question and  interesting in EMC.

Also please consider…
multi strike suspension that escalates quickly to a ban
delete comments that are off topic, inappropriate, and spam
throttle comments using a timer

There are people frustrated with forum moderation who will continue doing this until something changes.  These posts are just like the spam Governance proposals last year.  There was a valid agenda that the NNS was broken and a nerve was pushed until Dfinity and the community finally gave in and made a change.  Please let’s make a change to forum moderation and enforce clear rules that limit the impact of people who want to destroy conversations.  It’s not possible to make everyone happy, so let’s not try.  It is appropriate for Dfinity to moderate the forum or hire people to do it as 3rd party contractors.  Please just implement policies that make it clear to most people that it’s a civilized environment where intellectually honest conversation can occur and technical support and community assistance can be provided.

Excuse me, no need to reply. I'm just here grabbing a screenshot of this before it disappears (like the community's money after they bought into the EMC presale and NFTs on ICP, and then the project jumped ship to another chain). 

It just goes to show that even "legit startups" can't be trusted in the space because it's all about money.

Goodmorning DFINITY Moderators @diegop & @Ang ! 

Just wanted to follow up yet again (is this the third or fourth time I’ve mentioned something - I’ve lost count) on these restless, baseless, personal attacks upon my character! 

I, like the creator of @Caesar (seemingly @wpb based off the obsession that this Caesar account quite clearly has revolving around me & him🤣), could also create endless alt accounts, slander people in the forums, and make a mockery of this community - yet choose not to out of respect for this ecosystem.

On the other hand, Ivan GPT doesn’t care. 

Looking forward to whichever direction you take this!

-------------------------

Caesar | 2023-11-10 16:51:12 UTC | #505

This accusation is utterly unfounded. It's evident that, in this context, @Accumulating.icp is spreading baseless rumors about both me and @wpb that hold no truth

Hey @Accumulating.icp.  I don’t know @Caesar.  It is not me.  I don’t create alt accounts on any social media platform including the forum.

I have been flagging the comments made by Caesar because they don’t typically add value and I suspect it’s just someone trying to poke the bear.  I would prefer that they stop.

Criticism is not removed. There are many things people may find as criticism that are part of the discusión. Bad faith and attacks are. If one ever finds themselves in the wrong side of that line, I recommend they look at their own writing tone and style before blaming the mods.

You may dislike it, but anybody who is objectively reviewing the forums sees the biased moderation style, of which borderlines censorship of opinion that differs from DFINITYs.

I won’t make you go back and count - but it’s more than 3. 

Your moderation style quite clearly revolves around job security - which is fine, but don’t try to act like you’re an unbiased entity if that’s the case. I’d personally respect you a lot more if you were upfront about it.

Every post of yours  where you complain about Dfinity or our moderating is objective evidence that we tolerate criticism. Surely you can see the incongruence here.  I have also removed posts that have attacked you and others.

It’s a public discourse forum, just about every conversation that will ever happen here will involve parties arguing & disagreeing. 

In the most respectful way possible, when was the last time you received moderation discretion training? 

You tend to have a history of locking threads when the questions for DFINITY get hard to answer:

This is a great example in which DFINITY can’t reasonably articulate why they’re voiding a passed NNS proposal. The solution? Lock the thread.

Build What is Right, Not what is Easy
I myself, build a better healthy life by bike riding, spin class, swimming, exercise, bush walking and I am an old man.

I was asked to come along by a friend for a drink at the local club after they had attended a meeting and I thought as always that it would be an adventure when it is something I haven’t done for decades.

I don’t like drinking and certainly not sugar drinks but will have a drink with a friend. The friend said they would drive and I thought, why not have a cocktail or spirit, play a poker machine and whatever else this club has to offer.

Great infrastructure but every wall and room was filled with gamers handing over their hard earned money, winning some but broke tomorrow, even a smoking section for the gamers to play, all with the promise of points and rewards if you hand over more cash, ready to throw you out if you say anything untoward.

Then there were the conversations of these delusional victims, well I am going home for tea, it should be ready and the table set, oh man I was so pissed last night, the obesity and struggle to	perform simple human actions of getting out of a chair and walking, yuk!

Is the IC becoming the same?

I belonged to another club and while they do have poker machines with no smokers in a small section they also have a swimming pool, gym, great restaurants and an air filled with fun and good conversations.

I don’t come here much anymore as the last conversation was with a hand puppet with pubic hair on it with a smart mouth and little intelligence that I am sure struggles with human actions and with a chair that exceeds it weight capacity and no woman wants that climbing on them so they have their hand puppet and a great supporter of Hot or Not. 

As always I will be hidden as I have no right to have a say or anything else but give my money and sit in this delusion.

The DFINITY team may be building what is right but there are no sparking conversations or projects. 

Sorry, have a life, must go and have better conversations over at Link,Sol and Inj.

Would you please share an example of a post where I did what you are claiming here?  In what way did I encourage anyone to give their money to this or any other project?

I usually think of you as a reasonable guy.  Hence, I'm kind of curious why you felt compelled to collect receipts, offer an "I told you so", and try to shame me for sharing my thoughts 6 months ago.  How did I provoke you to make this comment today?

-------------------------

FGhostwriting | 2023-11-11 07:38:05 UTC | #523

Hi Wenzel. First of all, thank you for acknowledging that I try to be reasonable with my comments. As you can see, I’m very frustrated at this point. I’ve always tried to be an active community member here on the IC, but it has become more and more frustrating as time has gone by. EMC walking away with everything the community gave them was kind of a “last straw” for me, especially since I remembered how a dfinity team member “stood up for them” when there were obvious warning signs and maybe we could have protected the community. As far as why I also picked out your immediate follow-up comment even though it was 6 months old, it’s just part of a pattern. For example, on Taggr, when I made my meme about how the SNS was basically beating itself to death by pushing through project after project that clearly wasn’t ready to decentralize (or maybe didn’t even understand what the SNS is intended for), you replied with a meme calling those of us who sounded the warning a “goon squad.” We’re not goons. The goal was never to hurt the IC or attack dfinity or you or even the project founders. We’re all invested here (although ones like me who don’t have as much money are not as heavily invested as others). And I’m sorry if you felt shamed by my comment. That wasn’t my intent. But maybe it serves its purpose - to help you see how frustrated I am watching these projects walk away with what little money the community has left under the guise of DAOs and other community-based values, when even the way the deals are structured or the white papers are set up always give clear indicators that the team is getting paid and the community is getting nothing. That’s all. It wasn’t a personal attack. It’s about trying to protect people - even if they’re people who are too greedy to realize they are being taken for a ride - from getting hustled by project after project while having people they look up to say, ‘let’s criticize less and support more.’ So if How impassioned I am about seeing this happen over and over caused me to lose my reasonable tone of voice for a moment, maybe that just shows where I’m at. And to be quite honest, I’ve kinda given up on the idea of being able to help protect anyone here anymore. Saying “I told you so” seems to be all I have left on the IC, and quite frankly I don’t want that anymore either.

How much did the community give them? Also this happens in traditional markets all the time. Didn't the WeWork guy walk out with billions from investors. Now WeWork is bankrupt. I mean at least here you have a chance at seed funding, but I agree that we need more people doing analysis of projects and people. I tried my best as people know and took on many attacks. Investing is hard, the fraud extends to every corner of Earth and governments. 

Please learn to forgive and the foundation isn't perfect. It will make mistakes. We can just try to not repeat similar mistakes. I still believe in the good work of the foundation.

Thanks Adam.  I appreciate you offering further explanation.  Believe it or not, I can empathize with your frustration.  None of us are perfect, or right, or wrong, in these discussions.  I certainly know that I've said and done things in the past that I wish I could take back...such as jumping on the goon squad characterization.  It didn't help anything and only served to antagonize.  Perhaps that was one of my periods of frustration.  To be honest, I think your meme and my meme both had truth to them.  However, my response to you on Taggr was unnecessary, so I apologize.

I appreciate that your comment was not intended to be a personal attack, but I feel like it was a false accusation.  You used my original comment to claim that I encouraged the ICP community to give their money to this project and that I tried to squash intellectually honest deliberation.  That is not true.  I advocated for civilized discussion at a time when there were many posts that we can no longer see due to moderation that were egregious violations of forum rules.
