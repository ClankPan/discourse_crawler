I would like to stake my ICP, however I'm not sure if I should do it directly with the NNS or wait for third party providers like Nano Ledger. How safe is my ICP locked for 5 years in the NNS. What guarantees do I have that is doesn't get hacked? Will the level of rewards be the same with third party providers? Please advice.
