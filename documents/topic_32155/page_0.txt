Just posting to compliment the AI bots in the developer docs.
A lot of useful information for IC is scattered all over the place.
Often it takes quite a while to find the information, and now the AI bot can search the documentation as well as some of the links to the information, and postings in the forums, and can provide the corresponding links, which I have to say is very useful.
