Hi everyone. The `Principals` field is no longer required by the `sns` CLI tool. Accordingly it has been removed from the [example sns_init.yaml in sns-testing](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/example_sns_init.yaml). 

If you're using `dfx sns`, you can install the new version with `dfx extension install sns --version 0.4.1`. (You may have to remove the old version first with `dfx extension uninstall sns`.)

If you're downloading `sns` directly from `https://download.dfinity.systems`, you can use `f79476803e097d9fd5f7e67d45f6818348b51ac9` as the commit to get this change.
