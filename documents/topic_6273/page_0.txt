When I log in with Internet Identity, the ic-delegation and ic-identity will be saved in the browser’s local storage, but I found that they will be automatically cleared when I visit the website again after a while, and I need to log in again. What’s the matter? Is there a good way to increase the time of the login status so that I can automatically log in the next time I visit the website?

The application using II gets to pick the `timeToLive` for the delegation. It could ask the user how long they'd like their login to be valid.

Hi [kritzcreek](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/kritzcreek) , thank you, I found the maxTimeToLive parameter.
```
     /**
      * Experiation of the authentication
      */
     maxTimeToLive?: bigint;
```
Should I pass in milliseconds or a timestamp?
If I set maxTimeToLive to 10000 milliseconds, it will expire after 10000 milliseconds.
If I set my maxTimeToLive to a timestamp of 1629883636, it will expire after this time is reached.
Does this bigint represent milliseconds or timestamps?

The protocol is specified here: [Internet Identity Spec](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/713a8d8ec27fd0474f64bceb3571d8022cdd1455/docs/internet-identity-spec.adoc#client-authentication-protocol)

With the relevant section:
> the `maxTimeToLive` , if present, indicates the desired time span (in nanoseconds) until the requested delegation should expire. The Identity Identity frontend is free to set an earlier expiry time, but should not create a larger.
