What's the minimal Rust version compatible with the ic* and candid* crates?

It depends on the crate, and for many it's not even specified. `ic-cdk` for example targets `1.66.0` (see [here](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/blob/main/Cargo.toml#L11)), `candid` does not have an explicit minimum version, but I can see in CI logs that it simply uses the latest one to run tests

I might set 1.66.0 or 1.71.0 (which I used for a long time) as minimal version in my tooling then. 
Thanks for the feedback!
