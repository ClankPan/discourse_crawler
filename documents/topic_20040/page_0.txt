It depends on your location - the further your message needs to travel, the longer it takes for you to get a response

Hi @charm 

We have several boundary nodes distributed across the world that are serving traffic for `ic0.app`, `icp0.io`, and `icp-api.io`. Whenever you resolve the domain to an IP address, our DNS infrastructure will return you up to four IP addresses of the geographically closest boundary nodes. The geographical distance from the closest boundary node matters for the speed as @Severin mentioned. Hence, you can expect the fastest response in Europe and North America, where the "boundary-node density" is the highest.
