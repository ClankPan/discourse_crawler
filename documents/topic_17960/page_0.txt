Hi all!
We submitted proposal [**103231**](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/103231) for a security update on top of `5c25ebf` . The security update will be applied to all subnets and after that the changes from the security update will be shared publicly, in accordance with the Security Patch Policy and Procedure that was adopted in proposal [48792](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48792).
The community will be able to retroactively verify the binaries that were rolled out. The instructions for doing this are in the proposal summary.
