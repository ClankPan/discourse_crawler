I am on a Mac. I previously ran `dfx start --background` without any issues. However, now when I run `dfx start --background`, I am getting this error:

```
Running dfx start for version 0.15.1
Using the default definition for the 'local' shared network because /Users/princesseth/.config/dfx/networks.json does not exist.
  Version v0.15.1 installed successfully.
thread 'main' panicked at 'Error creating persistent pool at: "/Users/princesseth/Library/Application Support/org.dfinity.dfx/network/local/state/replicated_state/node-100/ic_consensus_pool/consensus".

```

I tried to `dfx cache delete` and `dfx stop` to no avail. What could be the issue?

Nevermind, I was able to fix this by running `dfx start --clean --background`. I have to run this command quite often. What are reasons in which you need to clear the project cache so often?
