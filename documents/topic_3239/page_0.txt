How to send ICP from an air-gapped computer to my NNS app?

Following the instruction for seed participants, it's recommended to disburse ICP from neuron by two steps with an air-gapped computer and a networked computer. However, how to send ICP from the air-gapped computer to NNS app? Can not find any instructions for it, need support, thank you.
