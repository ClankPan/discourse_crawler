Is there an easy way to launch the NNS governance canister in pocket-ic for running integration tests?

I use this: https://hadronous.github.io/pic-js/docs/guides/working-with-the-nns to get a ready to go NNS set up for pocket IC tests.  It uses pocket-ic server under the hood, so I don't think there is any reason you couldn't use the same setup from rust.

https://github.com/icdevsorg/ovs-ledger/tree/main/pic has a state prebuilt and ready to go if you need one...I'm not sure how platforms work, but this was done on a mac.
