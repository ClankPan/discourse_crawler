Hey everyone!

I wanted to share with you a little tool that we've been working on and just open-sourced. It's called [canbench](https://docs.rs/canbench-rs/latest/canbench_rs/) and it's a benchmarking framework for canisters.

`canbench` is a tool that we built organically when we were trying to understand the performance of canisters and libraries that we were building. Once setup, it allows you to effortlessly monitor performance regressions as well as analyze the performance of your code.

Here is an [example](https://github.com/dfinity/canbench/pull/25) of what the `canbench` CI integration looks like (screenshots below):

Performance changes are detected:

No performance changes are detected:

Currently `canbench` only supports Rust canisters, but support for other languages can easily be introduced. Let us know if this is something you'd like to see. Happy benching üèã

Hey @ielashi,

this is awesome, and as such, should be added to https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-internet-computer ;)

Would you mind doing a PR?

Anyone got any ideas of what might be causing this error? 

"error parsing result of benchmark test. Result: module"

It looks like there's an error when executing the benchmark. Can you share the benchmark code and/or wasm module that's causing this error?

I am getting an error when trying to run `canbench`

```

Apologies for the slow response here. Is there code you can point me to to triage the problem? My github username is "ielashi" in case you'd like to share access to your code.

Hi @ielashi, Do you know why I am getting this error?

-------------------------

@zohaib29 Is your canister taking in init args? `canbench` doesn't currently support deploying a wasm that has init args. If yes, can you try removing them and see if that fixes the issue?

We should be able to add support for specifying the init args in `canbench.yml` - it's not that much work.

-------------------------

zohaib29 | 2024-04-30 08:56:17 UTC | #10

Yes, after removing init args it worked. Thanks!

-------------------------

ielashi | 2024-05-02 07:18:00 UTC | #11

Thanks for the feedback. I added two issues to improve `canbench` in that regard.

https://github.com/dfinity/canbench/issues/51

https://github.com/dfinity/canbench/issues/52

-------------------------

Update: The newest version of canbench (version 0.1.4) now supports canisters with init args. See [here](https://docs.rs/canbench-rs/latest/canbench_rs/#init-args) for the documentation. Big thanks to @frederikrothenberger for adding this feature!
