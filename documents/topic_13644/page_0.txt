I have a project with a canister that expects arguments and another canister that is just a simple asset canister. When I'm trying to deploy only the the asset canister with the following command 
```
dfx deploy --network ic assets
```
the command fails with the follwing error
```
Error: Invalid data: Expected arguments but found none.
```
I can deploy the asset canister when providing the arguments for the normal canister, which shouldn't be necessary imo. I think the specification of the `assets` canister doesn't trigger only deploying the assets canister, and still both canisters are being deployed. I believe this because I get the following output from the `deploy` command:
```
Module hash 202ec5edcf05fc3165213458ef0433547f8ebaa61f5a64fa54f2770670f0d37a is already installed.
```
The hash matches the non asset canisters WASM hash.

Thanks for the bug report @cryptoschindler. I can reproduce it pretty easily and have filed a ticket.

Partial workaround(s) if you don't want to specify arguments all the time:
- `dfx canister install` (see `--help` for instructions how to do it) or
- use `icx-assets` to upload your files. Installable via `cargo install --git ` `https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs` ` icx-assets`
