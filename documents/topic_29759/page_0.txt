Hello, I'm running a rosetta-api node for getting blockchain data. It works well for a long time, but recently the syncing stuck. 

the log:

```
04:09:38.264196 INFO [main] ic_ledger_canister_blocks_synchronizer::ledger_blocks_sync - Synced took 0.296231862 seconds
04:09:38.269253 INFO [main] ic_ledger_canister_blocks_synchronizer::ledger_blocks_sync - You are all caught up to block 11415374
```

Please help, thanks!

Can you restart it with `--log-level DEBUG` and see if there are some additional logs/errors?

Also, which version of rosetta are you using?

Thanks. Syncing recovered with latest rosetta-api docker image.
