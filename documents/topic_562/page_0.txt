The official Motoko VSCode Extension is now available in the VS marketplace! Features include syntax highlighting and integration with the Motoko language service. Give it a try today: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/dfinity-foundation

As this is now available on the market place you should probably change the readme :)

Great to see an official VSCode extension. I would also like to give a shoutout to those who worked on a few unofficial extensions for VSCode as they worked good as well.

Yeah, I'll change the README and add a couple of GIFs showing off the features this week :) Thank you for providing the interim solution, I should've published this earlier to avoid the duplicated work... We will be open sourcing the plugin soon and I'm looking forward to collaborating on it!
