I am trying to use the import macro in Rust, to talk between canisters. The types don't seem to be translating over intuitively, and I am not sure how to use custom object types. There also seem to be some bugs and issues with the macro (I have opened an issue on the repo for one of the bugs I have run into).

Is there any good documentation or are there any examples for Rust interop with other canisters? I have found this: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/rust-guide/multiply-dependency.html but it only shows how to do a Nat, it would be nice to understand objects as well and how to convert the nat into an i32 or other primitive
