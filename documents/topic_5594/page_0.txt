Wondering, about large file upload to canister. 

How we can achieve file uploading of size 4 MB ?  Is there any tutorial or help available 

Appreciating much for your time and effort to reply to this thread
Thanks a lot

I'm not aware of a small, self contained example but the CanCan TikTok clone would up and download larger video files in chunks:

(Search for `Chunk` in here:)

Maybe someone knows of a smaller example...

The asset canister itself works this way, but the SDK team is actively working on readymade solutions to drop asset management into a custom canister. Weâ€™ll have something for you before long

Awesome. One limitation with the asset canister is that the assets need to known at canister build time (as opposed to dynamically uploading user-provided assets), I believe.

Technically not! The method runs after the canister wasm has already been installed, and it's more of a permissions issue to upload with user content
