Hi there!

There is a lot of curiosity about the status and future of DKP/SNS-1. We have been giving this a lot of thought and we wish to discuss with the Dfinity community the first steps that we envision for the DKP/SNS-1.

Firstly, we want to update the ticker symbol from SNS-1 to DKP (Draggin Karma Points). We understand that this requires a vote on this aspect at the NNS level, to which you would be invited to give your opinion. @domwoe @lara  Can you please confirm that this will be possible with an NNS vote? Do you have any time frame when we can expect to be able to submit a proposal to make this change?

Secondly, we wish to increase the amount of DKP in circulation for functional reasons. This step simply ensures that when people use DKP, they are using whole numbers rather than small fractions like 0.002 DKP. Note that as part of this measure, no token holder will be diluted. We will simply mint more tokens with an NNS proposal, which effectively will multiple everybody’s holdings by a certain factor x percentage, quite possibly to multiply by several hundred thousand.

@domwoe @lara : Can these two NNS proposals be combined or should there be one vote for the ticker symbol update and another for the increase of circulation?

We also wish to split the locked Dragginz neuron into two equal neurons to enable us to participate in community voting without affecting the decision-making process.

One big question is how to ensure that every holder of DKP gets updated when we multiply the number of tokens.  Our initial thoughts are to pause any exchange activity after giving two weeks or more notice. Then take a snapshot of everyone’s holdings and reallocate the new amounts accordingly. At this point we envision to be able to unlock the token and the token holder can then choose to opt in to locking and voting, or not.

Once that is completed, we wish to propose both an inflationary and deflationary mechanism:

Inflationary will be in the form of voting rewards based on a staking mechanism . Voting would take the form of fantasy governance. The voting rewards the Dragginz neurons earn would be used to cover the cost of cycles and development.

Deflationary would involve burning DKP according to a mechanism yet to be determined in further detail.

We wanted to make sure that a) this was possible, and b) we had done everything we can to ensure the exchange goes smoothly. We are in close contact with both our technical as well as our legal team to further specify details. We will share further information as soon as they are available.

As you can appreciate, the proposed changes are something we only wish to do once, so we really want to ensure that we do this correctly. As we are dependent upon the NNS to proceed on a technical and governance level, we invite you to comment on our intentions / plans, which shall also allow us to get a better understanding of the technical and procedural timeframe .

Any thoughts or feedback would be most appreciated.

I agree with the decimal adjustment proposal but in regards to voting rewards/inflation this would enable you and Borovan to essentially mint 48% of the daily inflation rate.

Acknowledging future FUD... what's stopping you from dumping the rewards?

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-09-26 16:59:31 UTC | #3

Are the dkp going to be burned for cycles or sold for cycles. If it's sold then we're just going to result in constant inflation unless the burning mechanism you guys havent announce will be on par with rewards. 
I love the current tokenomics of this coin and am fine with moving decimal places for holders but just would be sad to see the coin with best tokenomics in all of Crypto in my opinion just turn into another inflationary mainly token where barely dkp is burned

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-09-26 17:00:06 UTC | #4

The plan was to burn for cycles

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-09-26 17:00:20 UTC | #5

Thanks for the clarification

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-26 17:33:51 UTC | #6

Would the lawyers be providing clarity on inflationary side or deflationary side?

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-26 17:36:38 UTC | #7

Also this part is a little confusing for me, "The voting rewards the Dragginz neurons earn would be used to cover the cost of cycles and development."

How does voting reward relate to cost of development. 

Would the staking reward match exactly the amount of cycles & development? 

Effectively making inflation=deflation?

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-26 17:40:31 UTC | #8

Im not entirely sure you can just burn for cycles as you need to provide value to purchase the cycles... but we'll sort something out that keeps everybody happy.  

Details will be forthcoming

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-09-26 18:03:18 UTC | #9

This is still TBD.  Adam and I do not want to personally profit from voting rewards, we do however want to push Dragginz towards self-sustainability whereby the voting reward proceeds would be used to pay developers, artists, moderators, costs of cycles and all other associated costs of running a large scale game on the IC.  

This is where we would love to hear suggestions or comments to how we can do this fairly and transparently.  

How much it costs to run the game is very much a big unknown right now as we dont know how many cycles are needed per player etc.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-09-26 18:22:05 UTC | #10

Basically our hope is to throw out our initial thoughts, get feedback from community and then we go back to lawyers and see what we can and cant do.

-------------------------

nolyoi | 2023-09-26 21:15:30 UTC | #11

Curious, are there any plans for people who had SNS1 that was locked for a significant amount of time pre-takeover?

If there are voting rewards will there be a time bonus for example?

EDIT:

Sorry glossed over this bit:

> At this point we envision to be able to unlock the token and the token holder can then choose to opt in to locking and voting, or not.

-------------------------

bytesun | 2023-09-27 00:51:08 UTC | #12

how about keep SNS-1 as it is for governance, and add new DKP token for game?

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-09-27 01:28:12 UTC | #13

I like the idea of a single token for everything in this game instead over complicating things and start to add more tokens for different purposes. Also think DKP should be more than just a regular governance token. 
The question now is how can you create the perfect equilibrium of tokenomics where the game can sustain it's self, sustain devs, and intrigue and sustain players and investors. 
Itll be the first of its kind where a game actually sustains every single one of those categories from its internal ecosystem. It's a very complicated problem. 
We're in for some interesting times and am excited to see how all this pans out. Also grateful to be apart of this since sns was launch and seeing how everything has developed post launch.

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-27 05:13:08 UTC | #14

Rather than having to mint tokens, can the team take a 30-50% cut from all the products sold to make money for development and upkeep? The team can then increase and decrease the tax to stay at no profit/loss. 

Also, the team can look at other ways to make money by taxing other parts of the game. The NFT marketplace, token transfers etc.

This would ensure there's no inflation and rather a slight deflation from the token transfer burns, which could also be tweaked.

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-27 05:15:06 UTC | #15

The idea is to create multiple utilities for DKP and then tax a % of it for maintenance.

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-27 05:16:13 UTC | #16

Part of this tax can be given to stakers as well. That incentivizes staking and voting.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-27 07:03:33 UTC | #17

We don't have to mint tokens, the issue is really how do we pay for growing game development costs over the next 2-3 years while income from the game is low.

Eventually sure, we'd have a lot of players and any revenue would go directly to the game hosting and development costs (no fat salaries or shareholders etc.)  I don't want to slow down the pace of development before we get to that point.

The 1 billion/year was just the first concept we came up with.

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-27 09:33:28 UTC | #18

This makes total sense, the team should make the calls in the initial days.

How about rather than having a fixed inflation of a billion tokens each year we mint tokens after a week/month minus the revenue from in-game buys and other revenue sources?

Ex. 
|Week/Month|Revenue (Mil.)|Expenses (Mil.)|Minting (DKP@$0.01)|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|0.1|0.125|2.5M|
|2|0.12|0.2|8M|
|3|0.15|0.25|10M|
|4|0.2|0.35|15M|
|5|0.5|0.5|0|
|6|1|0.7|-30|

By having the weekly/monthly minting we can navigate the conditions more nimbly. We only mint what we have to. By minting a Billion upfront sure we get the predictability but what if the in-game revenue more than made up for the expenses or it's way less than the expenses?

The team should first use the in-game revenue/other sources of revenue for their expenses and then go on to mint tokens.

I understand this might not sit well with others as it leaves scope for the team to mint tokens at their whims but then the team would anyway be in the control with majority of voting rights so if they really want to dampen the token they can.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-27 09:30:01 UTC | #19

We're sort of limited by the SNS right now.  We've already requested a few features that weren't on the roadmap, but something like this would be a much bigger change.

It's probably easier to just have no inflation to be honest.  Lock 51% up for the SNS control and then the rest for the community... Just have to explore other options when it comes to growing the team.

A bull market would really be nice, but it's not essential :)

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-27 09:37:32 UTC | #20

Well wouldn't that make everyone happy. No inflation! 🤩

-------------------------

reyrayz | 2023-09-27 10:01:27 UTC | #21

IMO part of what makes SNS1/DKP so unique/attractive is the limited supply available. I'm curious as to why can't game users just transact with 0.01 SNS? and so on? I don't believe in stirring the pot and messing around with the supply.

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2023-09-27 10:29:43 UTC | #23

Deflationary model without harming the operations would be great.

How about coming up with some numbers, let say 1 billion tokens, 20% (+,- ) to be used for rewards and some expenses payments for the next 10 or 20 years....

If required, burned tokens can be minted up to a total of mint QTY minus 1%. Example, in the first year if 3% of DKP burned, Overall tokens 97% (first year 100% -1=99% maximum amount can be minted first year, second year 98%, and so on, perhaps after 2 years reduce by 0.5% per year...)

So DKP token deflationary yet can be minted if required while being deflationary.

Origyn has somewhat similar tokenomics

https://dashboard.origyn.ch/Tokenomics_V3.pdf

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-27 10:51:04 UTC | #24

It would be more like 0.0000001 SNS that's the issue.  

We'll be just increasing everybody's tokens by 800k (as an example), so the supply is just as limited but the decimal place moves.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2023-09-27 11:43:16 UTC | #25

SNS1 should be different from an inside inflationary/deflationary token.

SLP from AXS suffered a lot from endless inflation

Make decimals DKP and leave SNS-1 for governance

-------------------------

tranbatot1994 | 2023-09-27 11:45:48 UTC | #26

You can use smaller units, (ex: 1 SNS1= 1000000 DKP) it is like Satoshi is a smaller unit of Bitcoin.

I don't like inflation.

I think revenue from costumes and copyright fees would be better.

-------------------------

Cogo | 2023-09-27 11:53:09 UTC | #27

Agree with @reyrayz  as I really like the limited supply of the 1st SNS token what ever its name is. Just feels cozy. 
Even if value stays the same

But its your project and completely get that decimal places wont work on an in game token

Look at Ordinals on BTC. I spend 5 minutes just counting the zeros before I make a transaction. Does my head in every time

Again would be cool to keep the SNS-1/DKP to original 10k limit somehow
Maybe if you wanted to participate in the game you could burn your SNS-1/DKP for 10,000x, 100,000x or whatever for game tokens?

Also not sure about unlocking already staked Neurons. That will double the liquid supply in an instant and probs devalue the token in an instant?

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-09-27 11:58:30 UTC | #28

Well our 51% would always be locked and wont ever be liquid supply

-------------------------

Cogo | 2023-09-27 12:07:36 UTC | #29

Sorry I must have mis understood this sentence?

"At this point we envision to be able to unlock the token and the token holder can then choose to opt in to locking and voting, or not."

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-27 12:13:52 UTC | #30

That would be if and when we increased the token supply.  We'd have to manually mint and give new tokens to people.

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-09-27 12:34:21 UTC | #31

Does that mean all the locked tokens will become liquid?

-------------------------

Cogo | 2023-09-27 12:41:54 UTC | #32

Yeah, I guess thats my point. All those new tokens will be liquid for a time when minted. Up to you/us to make the same locked commitment & keep the supply proportionally low like it is now. 
Hard to do when the price of the token keeps mooning

At present >50% of tokens are locked for >100 years or whatever. So the 10k supply is really <5k for our life times. Makes the SNS-1/DKP ultra rare for a token. 

Not an expert by any means, just my feedback :clinking_glasses:

-------------------------

nolyoi | 2023-09-27 12:52:20 UTC | #33

What if you did a combination.
1. converting the current tx burn mechanism to a tax that goes to a development fund wallet.
2. rewards from liquidity (i assume all that fresh liquidity is you). 
3. and then inflation to cover the rest. 

The first two require no inflation, but are ofc the funds generated will probably be minimal for some time and are dependent upon activity and price action. But anything to reduce the inflation. Additional mechanisms that don't require it.

-------------------------

BIKETACO | 2023-09-27 12:56:49 UTC | #34

I agree with this.  There could be a final mechanism where the main neuron burns excess rewards either by buying DKP items and giving them away or just by burning what is not needed.

-------------------------

daeitus | 2023-09-27 13:02:50 UTC | #35

you could use the voting rewards from an icp neuron to fund cycles. this way inflation inherent to the network would be used, with no swapping of dkp/icp necessary.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-27 13:03:12 UTC | #36

Well what we may have to do is take 10,000, add 7,999,990,000 and then dish that out proportionally.  So only 1/800k of the value is actually locked up.  We're sort of tied by the SNS but the team are helping us.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-09-27 13:08:13 UTC | #37

That was our original plan until the price went to Goblin Town.

We could still do it but I'm not sure that at $3 the amount of ICP we could put in a Neuron could cover the game development.

-------------------------

[/quote]

Well, yeah.  If we're not funding the development by inflating the token, then we're probably not going to be burning it either.  All the revenue the game makes will go to the hosting and development costs and we'd retain a buffer.  Would make no sense to burn it.

The supply is definitely going to increase by multiple orders of magnitude, it has to or it would be a nightmare.  Our rough back of napkin calculations are based on dividing the supply by the number of players we had at Neopets (it's nice to have goals.)

Maybe the neuron can be the starting point and depending on the price of ICP and rewards rate the inflation of DKP changes to meet funding needs

Hi @Thyassa,

This is Georgi from the NNS team. 

Thanks for sharing your ideas for SNS features. Let me shed some light on these.

**Change token symbol**

As @lara mentioned previously, this functionality exists on the ledger but it is currently not exposed to the SNS projects as a feature. We gave it some thought after we heard it the first time a couple of weeks ago and concluded that it is not a trivial change. Given the current workload, this was pushed back for now. We will revisit it once we finish the work on token minting.

**Increase the number of tokens in circulation**

We recently got a similar request from @modclub and since we had a few free cycles on the team we decided to prioritize it. We’ll follow with some details here on the forum within the next day or two and will ask the community for input. Getting this into mainnet is likely to be quick, should there be positive feedback.

Hope this helps in understanding the big picture.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-09-27 19:47:58 UTC | #46

*Just commenting, not advice or anything useful from me here...*

It sounds like you just need to rip the bandaid off and max-out the total supply - it might hurt at first, but DKP/SNS1 kinda has a cult following, forgive me as I don't know the difference between cult and community, they seem the same to me. But, I don't think it's a bad thing... if you look at meme coins with astronomical total supply and meme coin enthusiasts who purchase them with the dream of becoming rich quick, you could possibly max the supply and get a bunch of meme coiners to buy into the project and raise the price quickly - it might solve all your problems. I'm horrible at explaining my thoughts, my brain works different, so hopefully you get what I'm trying to convey.

-------------------------

a.out | 2023-09-27 20:08:26 UTC | #47

Well to play devil's advocate (I have no issues with increasing the supply personally) but there could always be a workaround similar to satoshis for btc. For example there are some platforms that work with such small amounts of bitcoin their value display is measured in number of satoshis (whole number) rather than represented via decimal BTC balance. That would be a pretty clean option if it was really necessary to maintain current supply. No idea what we'd call these micro units though...

Ok, thanks for the reply. What if there are more voting rewards given in the inflation mechanism than tokens burning in the deflation mechanism. could that cause dilution?

-------------------------

[quote="reyrayz, post:48, topic:23321"]

[/quote]

Yes, that could dilute your effective voting power as a proportion of total voting power if people choose to stake those tokens for additional voting power and you don't stake yours.  

In a system where all tokens were initially in neurons, you could only dilute your voting power by choosing not to stake your voting rewards, or by not voting on all the proposals and thus getting fewer rewards.  And of course, the actual effect depends on the behavior of other participants - are they voting and staking rewards?

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-27 23:52:05 UTC | #50

Ouch! I wasnt even looking at it that way. Horrible typo possibilities too. I can see where you need to cover more than that 100x gap I was looking at.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-28 00:50:24 UTC | #51

Simply displaying the micro unit as a whole number does not solve the problem of higher transfer cost over transaction value. If current supply were maintained there would be a need to lower the transfer fee in SNS-1 to satisfy the cost/value disparity.

Example: Using the value I cited from Borovan earlier of 0.0000001 SNS. Regardless of what we call this unit or how it is visually represented in UI the unit is still 0.0000001 SNS. So although you see a whole number in your UI the cost you will pay will exceed the value you send without fee modifications. Because the fee to send the 0.0000001 SNS is 0.00001 SNS or if looked at in terms of the micro unit the 1 micro unit would cost 100 micro units to send.

-------------------------

Gabriel | 2023-09-28 08:10:08 UTC | #52

yeah, when you have put 8 zeros but you put 7 or less it's gonna be a nightmare. As Cogo said you need to take your time and count them to make sure it's right. Also there's gonna be a mix of people playing the game and dealing with a lot of zeros to buy/sell something it ain't pretty and most likely people will find it very confusing.

-------------------------

Hoangnam | 2023-09-28 15:19:22 UTC | #54

Nice,i like your idea, like bitcoin satoshi

-------------------------

keyleehoang | 2023-09-28 15:19:34 UTC | #55

I think there will need to be an airdrop for SNS1 = DKP holders, in % between SNS1 and DKP, an IDO sale for newbies and DKP airdrops for new users to register dragginzgame and experience the game
For example, the project buys back 1000,000 DKP when there is revenue: burn it 25%, 50% reward players, 25% airdrop for new users
 Or this 1000,000 DKP will be distributed periodically once a month in the reserve supply
I think it is necessary to set aside 20% of the DKP supply to pay monthly rewards to players within 3-5 years. This will ensure the long-term sustainable development of the project with ICP. This is my personal opinion, thanks

-------------------------

Neekbillz | 2023-09-28 17:29:09 UTC | #56

We sure need to look into this critically, before any decisions are made, I wouldn't want a case where the unexpected happens, you guys can study similar models you want to implement from other projects and see if it's worth embarking on.

My one cent.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-09-30 09:58:32 UTC | #57

@borovan @Thyassa as an alternative (not sure if anyone mentioned this already), what about a new in-game token (similar to what HotOrNot does with `COYN`) - indeed `DKP` - keeping SNS1 as is - as a governance token?

You could even tight those two by setting (permanent) SNS1/DKP exchange rate (1 SNS1 = 1000000000000 DKP...?) which would ensure the relation and value - just not sure how complicated would be to guarantee this (obviously the number of existing SNS1 and DKP would need to stay in sync).

-------------------------

BIKETACO | 2023-09-28 20:23:02 UTC | #58

is there another way to reward staking and voting?  Maybe with a % of item sales?  Initially I was in the camp of 'inflation is the devil' but I don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater...

-------------------------

wilak | 2023-09-29 15:36:54 UTC | #60

(Investor/holder perspective)

Here's a deflationary proposal that also introduces the concept of a secondary token:

Introduce a unique in-game currency distinct from DKP. In-game currency should be inflationary. Allow a direct swap between this currency and DKP, similar to the IC cycles<->ICP model (and let this be the only possible swap). The market will then determine the relative value between the in-game currency and DKP. Every time a swap occurs, impose a fee. Part of this fee could be burned to create a deflationary effect, and the remaining portion allocated for game development. This introduces a deflationary dynamic to the in-game currency. The burned fees could also go into a wallet that burns it all when a certain balance is reached, to create hype.

Couple this with transaction fees as another deflationary measure, and rewards for holders as the inflationary counterbalance in a separate/second DKP SNS, a balance could be created in the total DKP supply as the game progresses. Part of the holders SNS-rewards could also go to development, depending how big the DKP fund is excluding the  staked DKP in the main SNS.

If structured thoughtfully – determining appropriate rates for swap fees, transaction fees, and SNS rewards – DKP inflation could be moderated over time, without sacrificing the funding for its development.

As a holder I wouldn't mind a bit of inflation in the beginning, as long as I can ride the inflation with my SNS rewards.

-------------------------

wilak | 2023-09-29 16:47:59 UTC | #61

Little addendum with things I assumed:

- That its possible to split the SNS

- That splitting the SNS would mean a real split, where DKP is used in both the SNSs. The newly made SNS would be used for ingame stuff, and its scope could be set programmatically by the main-SNS where borovan holds all the voting power.

- As inflation of DKP would occur due to SNS rewards, it would be possible for a new 51% attack in the main SNS to happen. Although its against the moral of the SNS, the main SNS could be closed, not allowing new members. Or you could say that its a responsibility for the DKP team to always have 50%+.

- That its possible to create an in-game token that is only allowed to be swapped with 1 DKP pool. Does not have to be ICRC1, can be a new type. A new type shouldnt create problems as the IGC should then only be used in game. (Technically I can imagine this is a hard one)

I am in favor of a new in-game currency, as IGCs should be inflationary for a healthy game economy (this does not necessarily hold for DKP). Also, you dont want DKP to be inflated when an in-game exploit happens (you never know). However, I wouldnt say im in favor of creating a new SNS with the in-game currency, as this could completely undermine DKP.

Right now the sns-1/dkp ledger canister has 1-trillion token-quantums (minus the burned transfer fees). The decimal places are just for aesthetics and have no relevance in the canister contract code. If the goal is to move the decimal point for easy viewing, you can just change the ‘decimals’ variable to 0 without minting any new tokens.

If this route is taken before changing the decimal value to zero it might be a good idea to adjust the fee. Otherwise I could see where when the decimal is removed anyone moving tokens is going to pay 1k transfer fee until a proposal is passed to bring the fee down if value is held quantitively in the canister in this way.

I don't understand, if you want to change SNS-1(name, symbol, supply...) totally, why don't just launch a new SNS DAO? why bother to take over original SNS-1?

I seriously doubt that :wink:

seemed like a good idea at the time ;)

Yes, thank you! I think we'll do this and have I guess 3 decimal places?

Me too, it just seems too complicated if we do that

Actually minting a new token would be much simpler (and cleaner) than changing tokenomics of the existing one.

We already have ckBTC - BTC twin, on the way is ckETH - ETH twin + ckERC20 - \<any\>ERC20 twin... - which are **twins of tokens from other blockchains**.
I think it would be much easier to use same logic/code (where relevant...) to create **SNS1 twin on the same blockchain/network (`ICP`) - called `DKP`, while changing 1:1 ratio to 1:100000000** (for example, :snowboarder:).
- **that would basically mean that on ICP exists only a single SNS1 base token, which can be referenced by 2 symbols/names/and-amounts-of-units** (:heavy_dollar_sign:::moneybag:)
  - **both fully functional, with all ICP advantages, living it's own (independent) life** (until conversion - minting/burning)
  - **creating **new use-cases** for `token wrapping` :fire: :fire: :rocket:**
  - **everyone is happy** :heart:

But indeed this is just an idea, it's up to you guys how will these things be done, wishing you best of luck in either case (CCing also @borovan)!

Mentioning also @Manu (who I believe is closely involved (also) in ckBTC development) to save time and effort of stakeholders in case that such `ICP-Native-Token-Wrapping` would be not realistic :pray:

Awesome, sounds good.

We are mostly there, just waiting for Tendy to sign off on the decision.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-10-02 20:52:10 UTC | #77

Great! If waiting too long just give me a shout - I (or anyone else) can announce the Tendy sign off on the decision.

This might be off topic, are there also plans to list the token on a mainstream exchange? 
Or is that not possible with a sns token?

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-04 07:12:50 UTC | #79

It may come in time, but it isn't something we will push for.  The price of SNS-1/DKP doesn't really mean anything to us right now. (Contrary to some rather amusing conspiracy FUD I have seen)  

We are just focusing on building and will be self funding everything for the foreseeable.

Will have update on tokemonics decision shortly as meeting with legal folks later today to confirm what is and isn't possible.

Could you shed some light on how the price might mean something in future if it doesn't mean anything right now

IC_Maximillion | 2023-10-04 20:49:43 UTC | #81

Ok sounds good. 
Ive seen a post idea about just moving the decimal points, if that would be possible.
This sounds like the easiest idea if done right.

Last question: Any kind of release date in mind? For a Beta version or something?
