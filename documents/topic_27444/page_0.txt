Hello @Sal_Paradise 

I am sorry to hear about your experience. Looking at the metrics and logs, I don't see anything indicating a deterioration in performance at the boundary nodes.

To help us narrow down the issue, maybe you can provide us some more information (also via DM if you want):
* Have you been experiencing the problem for longer or did it suddenly appear?
* Where are you based? The boundary nodes in Asia are hosted in Singapore.
* Can you open the developer tools of your browser and check in the networking tab the requests. We are interested in two things: `Remote Address` and `X-Request-Id`.
