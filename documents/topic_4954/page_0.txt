It tried to update my code, but it seems like "dfx start" now loops forever with "failed to truncate heap of canister" and "Invalid argument" and I can't uninstall-code nor delete the canister. What to do?

Seems like a bug.

`rm -rf .dfx` in the directory you ran `dfx start` from might unblock you for now but I think you would lose all state by doing that.

yeah you can do `rm -rf .dfx` or `dfx start --clean` should achieve the same thing. 
Was there something special you're doing your canister's pre-upgrade hook? are you able to share the code before the upgrade and after the upgrade?

start --clean made me run my new code, it was just playing with a greet example adding a new method inside the actor without input param like:

```
    public func senikk(): async Text {
        return "This is a message from senikk";
    };
```

It runned ok now with call canister. But after it runned I got "Cannot propose block as the locally available validation context is smaller than the parent" and "Failed to make a checkpoint" and now this is looping.

After running "dfx canister call hello senikk" it gives me the result but within a minute the trouble starts and I can't do anything more, the only working solution now is --clean or rm -rf .dfx

I'm begin wondering if its Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu I'm using right now which is causing the problems I have after calling functions successfully. Anyone with experience running with WSL?
