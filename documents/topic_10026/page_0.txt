I'm getting the error listed in the title when trying to run my app locally. It started happening seemingly out of nowhere. has anyone experienced this when running a canister locally?

I'm also seeing this error in the console as well:

```
index.js:22 Error: Server returned an error:
  Code: 504 (Gateway Timeout)
  Body: Error occured while trying to proxy to: localhost:3000/api/v2/status

    at HttpAgent.status (index.js:249)
    at async HttpAgent.fetchRootKey (index.js:258)
```
and this one:
```
[HPM] Error occurred while trying to proxy request /api/v2/status from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:8000 (ECONNREFUSED) (https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors)

I resolved this issue by changing my node version from v17.0.1 to v16.3.1
