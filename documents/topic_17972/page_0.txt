Noob question, is it possible to `dfx build` a Rust canister offline?

When I run the command I ran into an issue because it tries to download some advisory list from GitHub. Not sure if that's a common Rust thing?

Executing: cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p satellite --locked

`dfx` appears to be calling out to `cargo`, so you could try doing that yourself temporarily and add the [`--frozen` or `--offline`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/faq.html#how-can-cargo-work-offline) flag.

I think whether you have enough in you local cache will determine how successful that is.

You could also switch to a `custom` canister type and do that for your build command to keep using `dfx build`. That‚Äôs what I do for my Rust canisters but it‚Äôs not as straightforward.

Thanks! The `--offline` flag did the job üëç

```
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p satellite --locked --offline
```
