I am not sure where to post this as I am new here, but this new proposal is very vague and ambiguous, I do not know if what it is claiming is true or valid information. It only references the forums in general and nothing in detail is posted. I had to vote no on the grounds I need amplifying data and information. What is the proposal's intent? to prevent a token, due to a token with said name, prevent something they disagree with or a political opinion? I am only saying this because of odd phrase in it "Don’t let Donald win". What does that mean? I hope we get clarity before anyone would approve it. It could be the actual perpetrator trying to get a vote on a unsuspecting victim for all I can tell. 

If this is in the wrong place I hope the admins will move it to the correct place and please have someone enlighten me to what this proposal is all about and what is the grievance to block someone's else's work?

Respectfully,
A jm

I don't know if what it's claiming is true or valid information. It only references the forums in general and nothing in detail is posted. I vote no on the grounds, I need more data and information. Before I can vote, yes.

 What does that mean? “Don’t let Donald win”

I hope we get clarity before anyone would approve it.
