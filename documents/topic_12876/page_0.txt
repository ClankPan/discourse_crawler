Wondering if there was an old version of the docs for query methods. I remember the old version had a much more in depth table and description of query methods. It talked about stuff like cost, speed, etc. It seems to have been removed from the new docs as of may. Does anyone know how I could find that?

This might be what you're looking for. https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/computation-and-storage-costs

I'd imagine to get a rough estimate you'd look at:
* Ingress Message Reception
* Ingress Byte Reception

Maybe some considerations on how many operations your query call is doing (is it efficient, or scanning through an entire list)
