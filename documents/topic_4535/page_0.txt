I know this question has sort of been asked here:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/switching-to-ui-created-identity-canister-creation/4036

What is the current status or possibility in having a dfx identity imported or linked into NNS to gain more of a user friendly/UI solution to managing an identities Neurons? Think about ECT/Seed investors that might not be totally comfortable executing sign/call methods using dfx.

That's a great question. I think we are all waiting for some transparency and communication on the timeline for this. What factors are in play for releasing (or not releasing) this functionality and the challenges involved in doing this. Instead it's been complete lack of transparency and communication about why it's not possible, whether or when it will ever be possible or when more information will be made available. This leads everyone to assume the worst (which may or may not be true) and doesn't help the reputation of the decentralized internet computer.
