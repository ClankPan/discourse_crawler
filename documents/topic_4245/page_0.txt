Hi everyone,

I've been going through the tutorials and I've had a lot of issues with the front end on all. I'll start with the "explore_hello" tutorial. The tutorial states that if I have node installed that the project directory should look like the following after running `dfx new explore_hello`:

    explore_hello/
├── README.md      # default project documentation
├── dfx.json       # project configuration file
├── node_modules   # libraries for front-end development
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src            # source files directory
│   ├── explore_hello
│   │   └── main.mo
│   └── explore_hello_assets
│       ├── assets
│       │   ├── logo.png
│       │   ├── main.css
│       │   └── sample-asset.txt
│       └── src
│           ├── index.html
│           └── index.js
└── webpack.config.js

However, I am missing `explore_hello/explore_hello_assets/src` as well as all of the files in `explore_hello/explore_hello_assets/assets` except for `sample-asset.txt`

I believe the all of these files should be included in the project since I have node installed on my machine.  I have the following software:

dfx 0.6.26
node v16.2.0
npm 7.13.0
webpack 5.37.1
webpack-cli 4.7.0


What am I missing?
