# Solution

> **Shaping the new generation Creator-Consumer economy - the Web 3.0 way!**

**RuBaRu** aims to create a **Mobile-First Fully On-Chain** DAO-based tokenized economy owned & governed by the community, where ***creators, influencers, consumers, and brands*** coexist harmoniously. By doing so, we unlock new opportunities, reshape digital creativity, drive economic growth, and foster a thriving ecosystem of shared prosperity.


# Web3 advantages

1. A fully decentralized DAO-based ecosystem within the Web3 paradigm, where decision-making is entrusted to the **collective intelligence of the community**. This ensures **transparency and liberation from authoritarian centralized platforms**, establishing a resilient and inclusive digital environment.
2. Creator economy is growing exponentially and it will reach **$357 billion by 2025**. Web3.0 makes the creator economy borderless, thus limits the friction of regulations and fuels growth.
3. The fully On-Chain ecosystem grants **creators ownership of their profiles and content**, empowering their digital presence.
4. Within Web3.0, **transparent and trustless incentives & wealth distribution** is guaranteed for all ecosystem participants, including DAO members, creators, consumers, influencers, and brands.

# How is it built

> **Fully On-Chain as RuBaRu’s Fundamental principle**

In the RuBaRu ecosystem, every component resides entirely on-chain, leaving no room for off-chain components. This commitment ensures complete transparency and decentralization. 

Beyond this, key principles were identified to make RuBaRu appealing not only to the crypto community but also to traditional social media users:
* **Mobile-First Strategy**: Placing mobile at the forefront of our approach.
* **Best-in-Class User Experience**: Prioritizing an exceptional user journey.
* **Infinite Auto-Scaling**: Designing for limitless scalability.
* **Web-Speed Content Delivery**: Ensuring content is delivered at the speed of the web.

While finalising the **Tech Stack**, the team carefully evaluated various technologies to enable RuBaRu to seamlessly target existing *social media users, enhance user experience, minimize adoption frictions, and accelerate time to market*.


**RuBaRu's Technology Stack :**

* **Frontend** - Flutter (iOS & Android DApp) - Cross platform development
* **API bridge** - Agent Dart (AstroX)
* **Backend** - Motoko

**System Design - Embracing the essence of Microservices**
![Micro-Services Snapshot|690x353, 100%](upload://7EqJs4ErzBysGqkjWm0P1cMlt3e.jpeg)

To achieve a highly agile and adaptable system with seamless scalability for a ***growing user base***, RuBaRu employed a modular approach, breaking down the system into **auto-scalable independent Microservices (canisters)**.				 
* User Service
* Image & Video Post Service	
* Audio Service
* Story Service
* Comment Service
* Search Service
* Hashtag Service
 							
As, ***content is the core element within the RuBaRu*** ecosystem, we've developed a **On-Chain Mini CDN for storing & streaming assets like images, videos, and audio**, employing a canister farming technique along with **data chunking and sharding**. 


# Internet Computer superpowers

At the heart of this remarkable journey is ICP's cutting-edge blockchain technology. It's not just a buzzword – it's a game-changer. With its *full-stack capabilities, web-speed data streaming, and viable on-chain data storage*, ICP's blockchain offers more than just a secure ledger; it's a powerful toolset that RuBaRu masterfully wields to redefine the digital landscape. Below are some key capabilities of ICP that empower RuBaRu in establishing a fully On-Chain Creator-Consumer economy:

* **Viable Fully OnChain capabilities** to completely decentralize the ecosystem.
* **Reverse Gas fee Model** - Anticipating users to pay for social media platform usage is a recipe for failure. The Reverse Gas Fee model guarantees the elimination of this friction.
* **Composite Queries** - Developing fully OnChain micro-services for RuBaRu demands extensive inter-canister communication, and doing so at web speed, without Composite Queries it would be a disaster to build infinitely auto scalable micro-services.

# Status of the project

With the backing of Dfinity's Dev Grant, the RuBaRu team has achieved significant milestones in the development of the SocialFi DApp for a global audience. Here are some key accomplishments:

* Transitioned our backend services from a **Monolithic structure to OnChain infinitely auto-scalable Microservices**, ready to seamlessly host content posted by hundreds of millions of creators.
* Constructed a comprehensive **OnChain CDN service capable of storing media assets such as images, videos, and audio, and streaming them through HTTP URLs**.
* **OnChain Audio streaming protocol**

The team is getting ready to introduce the Pre-Beta release to the community, initiating a cycle of testing and gathering feedback. This sets the stage for preparing to onboard the **first million users** from the Web2 social media landscape.

# RuBaRu Project Update - Aug 9th, 2024 - Dfinity Dev Grant-2, Milestone - 2 - Live

> **Engagement Hooks: OnChain Notifications Services & Push Notification Broker Engine**

We are thrilled to announce a major milestone in our product development journey! Introducing our Fully OnChain Notification Service & Push Notification Broker Engine.

**Rationale for Developing this Feature:**
User experience is at the heart of everything we build. Whether you're using the RuBaRu Android or iOS dApp, our Push Notification Broker Engine ensures seamless and instant notifications directly to your devices. This new service enhances your interaction and engagement with the platform. Stay updated, stay connected, and never miss an important update again!
![notif_stats|690x460, 75%](upload://jcBv8dXTAtmhxtd3XBTBqTxLzda.png)

**Feature List:**

**1. In-App Notifications/Updates:** implemented a comprehensive notifications system where users can view all read/unread notifications, keeping them informed about their RuBaRu network. Each notification item supports click events to navigate users to relevant pages or actions.

**2. Push Notifications:** integrated push notifications by requesting user permissions, handling notifications seamlessly in the background or when the app is closed, and ensuring they direct users to specific pages or deep links.

**3. Notification Settings:** Provide a user-friendly interface for enabling push notifications, allowing users to opt-in to push notifications using preferences.


**Technical Details:**

**1. In-App Notifications:**

1. **Tech Stack:** Motoko
2. Building on our commitment to fully on-chain services, we leverage ICP Canisters with Motoko to develop highly available and modular microservices. The RuBaRu network now includes Notification Services, featuring two types of canisters: the Notification Registry Canister and the Notification Node Canister. The Registry Service maintains a ledger of notification nodes for users, with these nodes storing notification data on a rolling basis. Additionally, the Registry Service handles the horizontal scaling of Node Canisters to accommodate our growing user base.

**2. In-App Notifications:**
Push notifications require interaction with Firebase services to ensure that mobile devices receive instant notifications even when the DApp is not in use. These hooks help bring users back to the DApp and enhance engagement. Given the off-chain component of this feature, it is optional for users.

The broker service consists of following tech stack:
1. Java Spring Boot (app engine)
2. Redis (cache)
3. Kafkaesque (queue)
4. Postgres
5. A Java agent developed by @rdobrik for messaging with the ICP blockchain.

Been a very effective feature in my experience so far. I thinks i love the notifications feel of RuBaRu over every other apps/dapps notis on my android phone. Looks unique with that green RuBaRu icon that always pops up my notification bar on lockscreen. 

It's also fast. I called one of my friends in WhatsApp and i shared my screen,  like his post and he got the notification instantly. That's a big advancement for everything onchain with RuBaRu on ICP. Good job team! BUIDL on!!🫡

Getting better with every update.

Sormarler | 2024-08-10 00:18:14 UTC | #11

RuBaRu is an amazing app! The concept of a fully on-chain creator economy is truly groundbreaking. I've been enjoying using the platform, and the potential is immense.
One area for improvement would be optimizing video uploads, downloads, and playback speeds. It currently takes a bit of time for videos to load, which can impact the user experience. I'm curious to know the team's plans for addressing this issue and enhancing overall performance.

-------------------------

TusharGuptaMm | 2024-08-11 07:11:26 UTC | #12

Thank you for your kind words and feedback. We recognize that video streaming has significant room for improvement and optimizing it is a priority for us. We are actively working on this, with a few short-term fixes that will drastically enhance the video playback experience(e.g. range-request). In the long term, we plan to implement adaptive streaming and that will fix everything.

Regarding the upload process, we aim to optimize the UI/UX components to ensure users are not blocked until the upload completes. We have identified solutions and will be working on them soon.

# Get an Inside Look: Sneak Peek of RuBaRu's Whitepaper(WIP) on Monetization, Incentives, and Transactions:
![RuBaRu_monetisation|690x388](upload://ikpO8wnp6ebD14LHijwh7A9ewWY.png)

## **1. Reputation Score Algorithm:**

The premise of this mechanism is that seasoned creators should be able to leverage the hard work they've put in and the reputation they've built on other social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube etc, so they don’t have to start from scratch on RuBaRu. This will act as an incentive for big creators to start their RuBaRu journey.

Additionally, the reputation score should grow as the creator gains popularity on the platform, serving as a parameter/factor for monetization and an incentive for the creator. For e.g. Brands can easily identify Creators with better reputation scores for content collaboration.

## **2. CCIP:**

RuBaRu’s incentive program, the "**Creator-Consumer Incentive Program (CCIP)**", addresses a significant issue: the "Late & Unfair" incentives for creators, and the lack of rewards for consumers who spend time on the platform and interact with sponsored content. CCIP not only ensures fair and timely incentives for creators but also rewards content consumers for their activities on the platform.

1. **Post to Earn(P2E):** Creators can start earning incentives from Day-1 by sharing high-quality, engaging posts as soon as they go live. This system motivates even amateur or beginner creators. Additionally, seasoned creators can compete to be among the top 10,000 creators of the month or week, earning extra incentives for their captivating content.
2. **Viral to Earn(V2E):** Until ad monetization is enabled on the platform, viral content will be incentivized based on the engagement it receives.

     For example, creators can tentatively earn RuBaRu tokens valued at

* $10 for 1,000 views,
* $40 for 5,000 views,
* $100 for 10,000 views,
* $500 for 100,000 views,
* $1,000 for 1 million views, and
* $5,000 for 5 million views.

3. **Engage to Earn(E2E):** As an integral part of the ecosystem, content consumers who spend hours engaging with content will be incentivized for their activity. They can also earn rewards by interacting with sponsored content and participating in market research surveys conducted by brands, sharing their data in the process with their consent.

5. **Content Moderation:** In addition to automatic content moderation using DeAi (Decentralized AI), community moderation is crucial. Users can moderate and report content by staking their tokens. If the report is deemed valid, the user earns tokens as a moderation reward.

6. **Refer to Earn(R2E):** The best growth story for Web3 DApp adoption is users bringing in other content creators and consumers. To encourage this, the RuBaRu referral program will incentivize both the referrer and the referee when a new user joins. The referral bonus will be split equally, with 50% going to the referrer and 50% to the referee.

7. **Advocate to Earn(A2E):** Another go-to-market strategy involves empowering our users to become RuBaRu advocates on various social media networks, both conventional Web2 platforms and Web3 SocialFi. Users can share content about RuBaRu on these platforms, earning RuBaRu tokens for number of views they get on their shared content. System needs to be smart enough to identify bot based views.

## 3. **Creator Monetization:**

Apart from incentive for creators, there are multiple ways on how creators can monetize their profile and content.

1. **NFT Gated Content Subscription**

Creators can build NFT-gated premium content and sell full or part subscriptions to users. Any user holding the NFT for the gated content can access and view it.

2. **Micro Boosting Post/Decentralized Ads(#DeAd):**

  * Creators and users can boost and bet on any creator’s post by sponsoring the post or reposting it on their profile.
  * Creators can request renowned and popular creators to boost their post and pay a fee for their support.

3. **Ad Revenue Sharing:**

Creators will receive a fair share of the revenue generated from ads on their profiles. The revenue distribution is tentatively set as a 80-15-5 split: 80% to the creator, 15% to RuBaRu Token holders, and 5% for platform operational costs.

4. **Audio Creator Royalty:**

Audio significantly enhances captivating content. Creators can incorporate Audio NFTs into their videos, images, and stories. Audio creators can set royalties as either a fixed price or a percentage of future revenue generated from the content.

5. **Brand Collaborations:**

Brands can collaborate with creators to push sponsored content through the creator’s profile, reaching potential customers. The platform will provide various tools to facilitate these collaborations transparently, ensuring a trustless environment.

6. **Paid Shout-out by Creator:**

Users and creators can request personalized shout-outs or special messages, such as birthday or anniversary wishes, from any creator for their family and friends. The creator will charge a fee for this service.

8. **Tipping & Gifting:**

Users can show appreciation by gifting or tipping their favorite creators with tokens.

## 4. **Creator’s DAO:**

New creators who have the potential to become major influencers often lack the funds to make Creativepreneurship their main business, rather than just a side hustle. Even for seasoned creators, scaling up a creator's business requires funds and upfront liquidity to hire a team, acquire resources, and purchase equipment.

RuBaRu empowers creators to launch Creator Treasury DAO tokens, allowing users to participate in their growth journey. Similar to how users buy tokens from blockchain projects and become part of a DAO, creators can invite their audience to join their DAO. Creators can choose to allocate a percentage of their platform earnings to be distributed to their DAO members. Additionally, they can offer DAO members automatic and early access to NFT-gated premium content, enhancing the value proposition for future DAO members.

## 5. **Verified Profiles for Users/Creators/Brands:**

Users can request a RuBaRu verified profile by paying a verification fee. Verified profiles come with additional incentives, monetization opportunities, and staking rewards. Creators will see a boost in their reputation score with a to-be-determined factor, while brands with verified profiles will gain access to specialized brand outreach tools.

> We are in the process of finalizing and refining the metrics and figures for each item outlined above. We will share them for feedback as soon as we have the first iteration ready.

We look forward to your feedback and suggestions.
