What protocols are in place in a scenario where counter-measures need to be activated in a matter of seconds? For example, if a serious bug is discovered connected to the BTC canister that allows bad actors to drain funds. Does any action to resolve the issue have to go through an NNS vote?

This is relevant but I don't know its implementation status.

This thread by @bjoern describes 6 proposals that were all created, decided, and executed in around 5-10 minutes each.

Thanks, @jzxchiang , @paulyoung .
I gather from your inputs that countermeasures will always require NNS votes but Dfinity has the voting power to activate emergency responses within a few minutes.
The question now is: can we foresee situations where an action has to be performed in seconds rather than minutes? If so, should we vote on a proposal that gives Dfinity engineers executive power in emergency situations? It can be timebound, one month at a time rolled over with a new vote.
Again, this will only be required if there are emergencies we can envision which require an immediate response, without even a ten minute lag. Considering the importance of the changes currently being rolled out, this might be worth discussing.
