Hi, is there any information about how CanCan fragments and reassembles data/content? 
I was just wondering if stream-ripping could be prevented? I understand the data will be reassembled and was curious if a preventative measure could be introduced at this point? 

Thanks

You could look into DRM protection. Though if you’ve ever tried to scrape heavily chunked/fragmented web video it’s at least a bit of a pain to do, so that goes some way toward “discouraging” copying.
