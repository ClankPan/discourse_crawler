TL;DR;

   **IC Naming, Name service on IC, your web3 name, low cost & easy to use**. It is open source  and transparent. As an important infrastructure, IC Naming will be governed by the community in the future.

**Overview**

There are now 3.5 domain names. The domain name service supports the Internet services we use. The domain name is an important infrastructure of the Internet world. But this infrastructure also faces the risk of domain name pollution and domain name hijacking attacks. There are also some decentralized name services, such as ENS, but the gas is too expensive.

**Why do we want to establish IC Naming?**

- The icnaming decentralized service solves the attack risk of domain name pollution and domain name hijacking
- IC has decentralized storage and decentralized computing, but access to dapp on IC relies on centralized domain names such as ic0.app. IC Naming solve the problem of the last mile of iIC decentralization. IC Naming is a necessary part of the complete decentralization of IC

**Concepts**

- Decentralized websites entrance: deploy your website to IC, access it with your web3 Name.
- One name for all of your addreses: no longer need long addresses. Use your IC name to store your address and receive any cryptocurrency, token or NFT.
- Your web3 name: no more nicknames. Own your username, store an avatar and other profile data, and use it across services.

**Compatible with DNS**

We will open up the DNS of the traditional Internet through DNSSEC technology.

**Well-Tested**

IC Naming is highly reliable in code quality through automated unit testing and automated integration testing.

It is important to better inform the community about IC Naming.

IC Naming's core developers have many years of experience in the research and development of Internet underlying protocols, and are very suitable for such underlying infrastructure projects.

Curious about the difference between icns and ic.naming in the ecosystem. If someone from dfinity or the domain name teams could speak up that would be nice :)

Currently it's only possible to register seven characters or longer. Is there a date when shorter domain names will be available?

@Tyler As an investor, I find it a troubling that ICNaming is selling the same product as ICNS only because what you are selling is supposed to be unique and irreplaceable. If the same .icp domain is bought on ICNS and also ICNaming and crypto is sent to that same address then which one will resolve? I hope your answer is not whichever project develops faster because that would cause an entire loss of investment for either the ICNS or ICNaming customers. Thanks in advance!

don't worry. you money can't lose. because plug only support icns. so you can only send to icns name.

I am fairly certain that all the ICNS domains actually end with ".icp.host"

I suspect this confusion, which both me and my colleague had as well, comes down to this not being very clearly marked on their site.

Hi, may I ask how the latest info about the above ? I too am interested in getting my hands on a domain name for myself, but right now it lacks clarity about the unicity of the domain.

Cheers!

@Tyler 

any plans to go beyond ".bike"?

love your service, as well as the new lottery system, but wish I could use another suffix...
