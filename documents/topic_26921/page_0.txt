**TL;DR**: A hotfix for the NNS root canister was released in [proposal 127154](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127154) (the "current" proposal) less than an hour ago. The code has been published retroactively in branch [hotfix-FOLLOW-1237-limit-calls-from-root-to-management-canister-mr-16920][code], and can be verified in the usual way.

[code]: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/hotfix-FOLLOW-1237-limit-calls-from-root-to-management-canister-mr-16920

The Security Patch Policy and Procedure adopted in [NNS motion proposal (48792)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48792) is being followed.

**The security issue here**: Using the NNS root canister's `canister_status` method, it used to be possible to clog communication between the NNS root canister and the management canister. This could have been used to cause an outage of the NNS.

**The change/remedy**: Cap the number of calls from root to management that can be triggered by the canister_status method to an experimentally found safe value.

# Publishing the Code

Yesterday, NNS root was upgraded using the standard NNS release procedure. Specifically, NNS root was built from publicly available sources in commit `e7c7105` (Friday, 2024-01-19 at 4:13 PM UTC) and upgraded in earlier [proposal 127101](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127101).

From that commit, branch `hotfix-FOLLOW-1237-limit-calls-from-root-to-management-canister-mr-16920` was created, and the fix was added into that branch in commit `80261cb`.

Shortly after those changes were deployed in the [current proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127154), the branch was configured to be mirrored to GitHub so that it can now be verified by the public.

The hotfix can be verified in the usual way. Instructions can be found in the [current proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127154) itself.
