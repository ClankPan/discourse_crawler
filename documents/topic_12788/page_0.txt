Iâ€™m a newcomer to this amazing project/community and already incredibly bought in to the impact potential this can have on the world. Thanks to Angela and her Udemy course I discovered this blockchain and learned the basics of how it works. I have started a few minor projects but I am working on an Angular/TailwindCSS/Motoko NFT marketplace as I learn more about the IC. I am an intermediate dev and always looking for new opportunities, so I look forward to building some cool stuff on the IC!
