Hi, first I have a question. Is it really necessary to have a copy of internet identity locally to make it work in my canisters for authentication? 
If yes I have a problem during the deployment of it.

After running this command `II_FETCH_ROOT_KEY=1 II_DUMMY_CAPTCHA=1 dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'` I receive this output on Ubuntu terminal:

![image|690x201](upload://1VuWT5MLG1ZUrsdTBFWLeCQK0Yo.png)

I'm completely ignorant on Rust so for me that is a wall.

Yes, this is necessary. There's the vision that this won't be necessary anymore at some point, but for now it's required.

I don't know about the actual error. Let me ping the relevant folks

@lpettenella hi!

Can you tell me which commit you're using for Internet Identity, and which platform (macOS, Windows, etc)?

Also, can you try running `scripts/build` directly? that'll clear up the output a bit:
> `II_FETCH_ROOT_KEY=1 II_DUMMY_CAPTCHA=1 ./scripts/build`

Finally, any reason you want to build the canister yourself as opposed to using a prebuilt dev version?

Relevant links:
* [integration section in README](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity#integration-with-internet-identity)
* [integration example with prebuilt dev canister](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/tree/main/demos/using-dev-build#integrating-with-internet-identity)

I'm using the last one `44db91e` on Ubuntu using wsl.

I executed the command but the output it's the same.

Here is the complete output:

@lpettenella gotcha. The build was never tested on Windows and isn't really a supported use case right now; can you tell us more about why you need to build the canister as opposed to using one of the prebuilt ones like suggested in my last message?

Thanks for the help, sorry I forgot to answer, to be honest there are no reasons in particular, I was just following the instructions at this repo: [krpeacock/auth-client-demo: Example demo of how to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dfinity/auth-client to make authenticated calls to an IC app (github.com)](https://github.com/krpeacock/auth-client-demo)

I suppose I will try with the prebuilt version!

Ok, let us know if you run into any more issues :)

CC @kpeacock probably time for an update!

Just in case somebody finds this now via google: there is a step by step example on how to set up Internet Identity locally [here](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/internet_identity_integration).
