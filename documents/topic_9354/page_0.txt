Is there an icp-golang-sdk?  I would like to know if there is any golang library for signed transfer transactions other than the library github.com/dfinity/keysmith? This library can't do signed transactions.  (I need to use golang to sign transactions offline, not use DFX)

The is a [message signing tool](https://github.com/enzoh/hancock) written in Go by Enzo.

I am also working on a more general purpose [SDK](https://github.com/orgs/aviate-labs/repositories?q=&type=&language=go&sort=) in Go.

Is it convenient to provide an example of your [sdk](https://github.com/orgs/aviate-labs/repositories?q=&type=&language=go&sort=) signature transfer transaction?

thank you.

It is not finished yet. You will have to use the other tool I linked.
