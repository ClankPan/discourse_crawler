import supplier from 'ic:canisters/supplier';
suppler.addprofile({firstname, lastname});

Module build failed: UnhandledSchemeError: Reading from "ic:canisters/supplier" is not handled by plugins (Unhandled scheme).
Webpack supports "data:" and "file:" URIs by default.
You may need an additional plugin to handle "ic:" URIs.
