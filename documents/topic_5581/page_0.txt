Hi, 
  I just want to get expertâ€™s opinion on how safe it is if we give out principal ID? Is it safe as we disclose our wallet public address? 
Thanks!

Yes, I consider it safe.

If the principal is used to hold tokens, it will allow people to also know your ledger address and thus your balance and ICP transactions.
