Hello


One easy method to implement was to wrap `dfx` calls with some using `child_process`... But I think it could be nice to just re-use the compiled webpack javascript for the front-end.

Basically what I am trying to do is to have a NodeJS version of the front-end script that would call the ICP Endpoint (per default http://localhost:8000).


What I am basically do is:
- `dfx build`
- import the included user JS library in dfinity (`lib.node.js` )


How could I make it so that : 
- I don't use the `dfx` but the javascript IDL using nodeJS


Open question: Any ETA of a NodeJS library/docs to interact with `ICP` ?
