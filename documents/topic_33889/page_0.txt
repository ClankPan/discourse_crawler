Ok, well more like getting feedback on how to officially introduce Mimic, because I don't want to screw up the actual alpha-ish release.

https://github.com/dragginzgame/mimic

We're the team behind Dragginz and have recently attempted to open source our Rust ORM/Framework/Database layer.  Honestly not sure what to call it, it's "all the bits that we can share that aren't secret game design information".

My aim is for this to be a layer above the IC-CDK where developers can write their data model, logic and optionally canister architecture, and benefit from the tooling that we've created.

So, please roast us and we will incorporate all the feedback into the next release.

ic devs - best bang for the buck is :
```
orm/src/traits.rs
db/query/lib.rs and related files
orm/macros
orm/schema
```

those are the best places to start.  orm is where all the cool stuff is

Oh, so you've basically open-sourced "Dragginz Lite"â€”everything except the juicy stuff that actually makes the game fun. 

A layer above the IC-CDK for devs to play around with, but the secret sauce stays locked away in the vault. How generous! 
It's like giving away the wrapping paper but keeping the gift. Very on-brand for a dragon-themed project, guarding the treasure and all.
