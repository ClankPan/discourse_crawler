Here's a new blog post on how to use `dfx` or `didc` to generate a JavaScript interface to talk to any canister you want.

There’s a GUI for the didc conversion step here too if it’s handy, paste the .did and generate javascript or typescript bindings: [didc binding generator](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/docs/)

Or you can grab the bindings directly from [rocks](https://ic.rocks/principal/rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai) or [Canlista](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/listing/internet-identity-10235/rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai) by clicking the javascript and typescript tabs. 
Both of these use didc itself under the hood, running as a wasm module in your browser.
