Hi,
I would like to programmatically upgrade a canister using Rust, but I couldn't find a way to do it with [ic_agent](https://docs.rs/ic-agent/latest/ic_agent/) nor with the [management_canister from ic_utils](https://docs.rs/ic-utils/latest/ic_utils/interfaces/management_canister/index.html), there is only [install or create](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#ic-management-canister) but it does not serve the same purpose.

Does anybody knows how to do it **without** using the terminal and dfx ?

Cheers
