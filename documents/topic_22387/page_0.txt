I've got a script in Juno ([source](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/main/scripts/cmc.sh)) that downloads and installs the CMC canister locally.

While trying to install a clean project from scratch, I discovered my script does not work anymore because the source of the CMC wasm is not accessible anymore.

Anyone knows where was the wasm file was moved?

This fails:

```
IC_VERSION=c9b2f9653afc2da47e5bd527c192090b860acbf0
curl -o cmc.wasm.gz "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/$IC_VERSION/canisters/cycles-minting-canister.wasm.gz"
gunzip cmc.wasm.gz
```

Because https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/c9b2f9653afc2da47e5bd527c192090b860acbf0/canisters/cycles-minting-canister.wasm.gz returns 

```
<Error>

```

Forgot to close this. I believe wasm hosted by download.dfinity.systems are deleted after 6 months, therefore the "old" wasm I was trying to download was not available anymore.

To solve the issue I bumped the commit number to most recent and luckily, there was no breaking changes. So my deploy script for local development was still ok.

I would like to add that in this form, the `CMC` will not be able to create canisters using the `notify_create_canister` method. I ran into this issue [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/canister-does-not-consume-cycles-local/17852/8?u=rabbithole) and the solution suggested was to deploy a locally modified version of `CMC`. I wrote [a small readme](https://github.com/rabbithole-app/rabbithole/blob/main/src/backend/cmc/README.md) how to build a custom `CMC`, a link to [`cmc.sh`](https://github.com/rabbithole-app/rabbithole/blob/main/scripts/cmc.sh). I hope this helps someone :slightly_smiling_face:

In case someone is facing yet another issue trying to deploy the Cmc locally

> Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed while trying to install all canisters.
    Failed to install wasm module to canister 'cmc'.

Try again. For no reason, I just restarted my script and it worked out.
