Hello/ Xin chÃ o, I'm Duc.
It seem that we haven't had a topic for Vietnamese introduction yet, so I decided to create one.
Great team, great achievements and great ambitions.
Hopefully, we will make "Reinvent the Internet" become reality, or perhaps ... Singularity.
If so, this will become the 2nd Internet Revolution, worth to put into mankind history.
I have high hope ðŸ˜¤.
