# TL;DR
The CodeGov team (codegov.org) has developed a simple utility that can relay votes from any NNS neuron to your WTN neuron (WaterNeuron SNS).  It is open source, so feel free to clone and use your own canister.  Or you can register your NNS / WTN neuron pair using the CodeGov canister using a few simple commands.  Instructions are provided below.  The app only works by command line at this time, but it would be nice to find a developer who will write a simple front end to make it user friendly for everyone.

The backend of this app was written by Hamish Peebles (@hpeebles), a co-founder for OpenChat and one of the reviewers of IC-OS Version Election proposals for the CodeGov team.

# Introduction
If you are an active participant in NNS governance and you are familiar with the [WaterNeuron SNS](https://docs.waterneuron.fi/), then you probably know that WTN neuron owners control a significant and increasing amount of voting power in the NNS.  The 6 month and 8 year neurons that are the source of substantial voting rewards earn maturity that is used in the liquid staking platform to pay high returns for [WTN](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/jmod6-4iaaa-aaaaq-aadkq-cai) and [nICP](https://waterneuron.fi/stake/) holders.  As the size of these neurons increase over time, participants in this SNS will have more and more influence over NNS governance decisions.  

Fortunately, the design of the WTN DAO is intentional about giving the WTN community a voice in the decision about how to vote on each NNS proposal.  This is accomplished by replicating every NNS proposal as an WTN proposal in a unique proposal topic called "Vote on NNS Proposals".  A WTN canister triggers the vote of the 6 month and 8 year NNS neurons according to the majority decision on these WTN proposals.  This makes the WTN community a value added contributor to internet computer governance.  

Unfortunately, it also means that active participants in NNS and WTN governance must vote twice on the same proposals...until now.  Below you will find a link to the the code for a canister that can be used to replicate votes from any NNS neuron to your WTN neuron.  This functionality was developed to relay [CodeGov NNS known neuron](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356) votes to the [CodeGov WTN neuron](https://oc.app/community/3fudd-diaaa-aaaar-bgmca-cai/channel/139936864411093443261235657527242394420/0/1?open=true), but it was quickly recognized that the canister could be useful to anyone else who wants to participate in WTN governance decisions that affect the NNS.

# CodeGov-WTN-Vote-Relay
Below are the instructions for configuring the vote relay canister so your WTN neuron will follow any NNS neuron you choose on the WTN proposal topic called "Vote for NNS Proposals". The code that performs the vote relay is provided by CodeGov. You are welcome to register your NNS/WTN neuron pairs with the CodeGov vote relay canister as per the instructions below. However, our repo is open source, so you are also welcome clone and modify the code to work for your own canister. This vote relay canister will replicate the vote of any NNS neuron you choose (it can be your own neuron, a known neuron, or any other neuron) to vote on the corresponding WTN proposal. In order to register a NNS/WTN neuron pair, you must be able to set the vote relay canister ID as a hotkey for the WTN neuron. Hence, you must be able to control the WTN neuron. The app provides prompts for setting up the pairs and it has error checking to verify that the setup is successful. You can also list all neuron pairs to verify that your pair was successful. There is a deregister command that can only be performed by the same principal that set the original configuration. That way nobody can deregister your pair. It is recommended to set your WTN neuron ID as a Followee for the proposal topic "Vote for NNS Proposals" in order to prevent your Followee for "All Non-Critical Topics" from voting before your preferred NNS neuron votes for you on this topic.

## Prerequisites:
You must be able to execute commands in a command line terminal and you must have any version of DFX installed.

## Clone Vote Relay Repo:
If you can run command line and have DFX installed, then create a directory where you want to clone the git repo for  the vote relay app. Change to that directory and run the following command...

`git clone https://github.com/CodeGov-org/codegov-wtn-vote-relay.git`

## Set Hotkey: 
Decide which NNS neuron ID and WTN neuron ID pair you want to configure for vote following. It can be any NNS neuron you trust (including your own neuron or any known neuron). However, you must be able to control the WTN neuron in order for this pairing to work because you must set the vote relay canister ID as a hotkey for your WTN neuron. The CodeGov vote relay canister ID is e5khx-vyaaa-aaaar-qagja-cai. Set the hotkey for your WTN neuron before completing the next step. Now is also a good time to set your WTN neuron ID as a Followee for the proposal topic "Vote for NNS Proposals". If you don't do this, then is it possible that your Followee for "All Non-Critical Topics" may vote before your preferred NNS neuron votes on this topic. Setting a neuron to follow itself on a specific topic is the only way to ensure that your Followee selection for the All Topics catch all doesn't vote for you on that topic.

Here is the vote relay canister ID again for ease of copy...

`e5khx-vyaaa-aaaar-qagja-cai`

## Register_Neuron_Pair: 
Change directory in your command line terminal to the folder called codegov-wtn-vote-relay, which was created when you cloned the repo. Run the following command from within this folder and then follow the directions when prompted.

`dfx canister --ic call codegov-wtn-vote-relay register_neuron_pair`

Below is the example from when the CodeGov NNS / WTN neuron pair was registered...

```
This method requires arguments.

Enter a value for RegisterNeuronPairArgs : record { name : text; nns_neuron_id : nat64; wtn_neuron_id : blob }
Enter field name : text
✔ Enter a text (type :e to use editor) · CodeGov
Enter field nns_neuron_id : nat64
✔ Enter a nat64 · 2649066124191664356
Enter field wtn_neuron_id : blob
✔ Select a way to enter blob · hex
✔ Enter hex string · 203312480b4aeef877f393f376533f4fdcaa477412ca1ae83abd8e897c0e726f
Sending the following argument:
(
  record {
    name = "CodeGov";
    nns_neuron_id = 2_649_066_124_191_664_356 : nat64;
    wtn_neuron_id = blob "\20\33\12\48\0b\4a\ee\f8\77\f3\93\f3\76\53\3f\4f\dc\aa\47\74\12\ca\1a\e8\3a\bd\8e\89\7c\0e\72\6f";
  },
)

Do you want to send this message? [y/N]
y
(variant { Ok = 6_284_408_412_449_121_150 : nat64 })
```

When prompted to enter the WTN neuron ID, you will first be asked if you want to enter TEXT, HEX, or FILE. Select HEX.

If you failed to enter the hotkey, then the variant will show `Err=variant{NotPermittedToVote}`. This means the
registration failed.

## List_Neuron_Pairs: 
You can verify that your NNS / WTN neuron pair is registered by running the `list_neuron_pairs` command below. If you see your pair, then the registration was successful.

`dfx canister --ic call codegov-wtn-vote-relay list_neuron_pairs`

This is an example of the output of this command...

```
(
  vec {
    record {
      id = 3_076_454_463_670_727_740 : nat64;
      admin = principal "zahk7-wlrqq-e2kcg-erf5x-mnwu5-i7ux7-yn34n-6la6z-tter3-peiqj-iae";
      name = "WPB";
      nns_neuron_id = 8_269_903_528_373_981_952 : nat64;
      wtn_neuron_id = blob "\ec\a8\df\ca\d7\09\75\b5\23\2e\1c\55\da\50\e7\34\ac\22\6c\ba\b4\e2\b3\af\e6\24\97\5a\74\c4\82\34";
    };
    record {
      id = 6_284_408_412_449_121_150 : nat64;
      admin = principal "zahk7-wlrqq-e2kcg-erf5x-mnwu5-i7ux7-yn34n-6la6z-tter3-peiqj-iae";
      name = "CodeGov";
      nns_neuron_id = 2_649_066_124_191_664_356 : nat64;
      wtn_neuron_id = blob "\20\33\12\48\0b\4a\ee\f8\77\f3\93\f3\76\53\3f\4f\dc\aa\47\74\12\ca\1a\e8\3a\bd\8e\89\7c\0e\72\6f";
    };
    record {
      id = 17_475_894_244_464_236_238 : nat64;
      admin = principal "tu45y-p4p3d-b4gg4-gmyy3-rgweo-whsrq-fephi-vshrn-cipca-xdkri-pae";
      name = "CodeGov";
      nns_neuron_id = 2_649_066_124_191_664_356 : nat64;
      wtn_neuron_id = blob "\20\33\12\48\0b\4a\ee\f8\77\f3\93\f3\76\53\3f\4f\dc\aa\47\74\12\ca\1a\e8\3a\bd\8e\89\7c\0e\72\6f";
    };
  },
)
```

## Deregister_Neuron_Pair: 
If you want to delete a neuron pair that you added, then it can be done with the command below.

`dfx canister --ic call codegov-wtn-vote-relay deregister_neuron_pair`

You will be prompted for the registration ID that was created when you registered your pair. Your pair ID can be found using the `list_neuron_pairs` command above. You must use the same principle ID to deregister that you used when you register your pair. This ensures nobody else can deregister your NNS/WTN neuron pair.

This is awesome! I'll take a look at using this on the weekened. It'll definitely save me time when it comes to voting. Thanks @wpb and @hpeebles! :heart_on_fire:
