I just noticed that the source repo of the Interface Specification has been made public:


https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec

It even has the full history included, which [I am very happy about](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/graphs/contributors).

I should use this to publish a more usable rendering of the spec somewhere. We internally used a stand alone view with nuch better ToC ergonomics, but for the public rendering it _had_ to be part of the larger docs site, and that just wasn't designed for documents of that size an depth.

What kind of cool things should we be looking at in this? What new can we learn?

The most important thing this brings is that we see and comment on [upcoming changes to the Internet Computer's interfaces](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pulls).

And as an update here: We are now also [accepting public contributions](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/2022-update-on-accepting-contributions-to-the-dfinity-ic-repo/11664/7) to the interface specification!
