I struggle with these conversions all the time. I found this [guide](https://dev.to/daviddalbusco/typescript-utilities-for-candid-caj). But the array that I get back is of length 64 instead of 32. 

To work with dfx I sometimes used a function on the invoice canister to do the conversion but I really need this to work in the front end now.

I'm just trying to call a local version of the ICP ledger to do a transaction.

That's my guide ðŸ˜‰.

In nns-js there's a [accountIdentifierToBytes](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-js/blob/a00fdfa2736783ffbc831a1190f0a49ba6263960/src/utils/account_identifier.utils.ts#L11) would that fits your need?
