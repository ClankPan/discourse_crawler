Came across a interesting post on r/icptrader. The context was r/bitcoin rejecting some posts for btc-icp integration. That got me thinking...how are we marketing our serious features, meme-style?



"I am in love with ICP...(a tongue in cheek reply to r/Bitcoin)

My entire history (+1yr) on reddit is on ICP (well 99%) & have nearly 1000 karma points because of it. I am doing something right.

Dear Mr Bitcoin...we are coming for you (in a good way). I know that you want to stay as a store-of-value. But really all store-of-values need to be spent. Your way of spending is not keeping up with the times( no real smart contracts, transactions take for ever, etc...)

Well, the love of my life , ICP, is just about to change that. Icp-btc integration will enable smart-contracts on YOUR network;  NO bridging. We will do this with significant state-of-the-art crypography. Yes, you will resist the change for a while; but you will eventually come to realize (just as us postal service did with email/internet) that this is good for you."

A few suggestions:
Transferring data between blockchains is beset with obstacles. The solution thus far has been to build bridges across the obstacles. The Internet Computer takes a radically different approach. It eliminates the obstacles and thus the need for insecure bridges. 
The Internet Computer: Unblocking blockchain. Dfinity: the Unblock-chain. ICP: Blockchain unbridged.

we can market by using it and in a viral fashion. Utilize spinner transactions by sending btc maxis shielded microtransactions as a prank and have them scratch their head on where the coins are coming from as just an example. Need to think outside the box. Traditional marketing can be seen as inorganic, need to do something that will catch people's attention yet at the same time be slightly controversial without being explicitly illegal.

shruti | 2022-08-03 08:18:51 UTC | #4

Love the ideas here & agree going unconventional can move the needle. I love the open letter format as well as the viral controversial thought process.  

Would anyone here be open to making a small marketing working group and put these ideas in action?

We could build some key terms like these and keep using them over and over again in our marketing to establish them in meme's etc. 

"Unbridging BTC"
"Bitcoin Smartcontracted" 
"Bitcoin Web3.0"

Thanks to @shruti , we have an open letter as marketing for btc-integration!! Many more such things to come for IC on IC.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-04 17:03:21 UTC | #6

I don't think talking to the Bitcoin community in such patronising terms is going to work at all. Also, it is 'stores-of-value', not 'store-of-values'. And no, stores-of-value do not *need* to be spent, they can be preserved for a long time and then sold when necessary or sufficiently profitable. Gold is often handed down for generations without any 'use'. Finally, the analogy is pretty inaccurate: I don't see how the internet was good for the postal service, any more than the internal combustion engine was good for horse carriages.
Of course Dominic Williams re-tweeted this, testifying once more to Dfinity's tone-deafness. Now, I need to spend half an hour on the Cardano forum, which always revitalises my faith in ICP.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-04 22:22:42 UTC | #7

I was chatting to a BTC maximalist who wasn't impressed about the ICP native integration because he correctly assumed that while it is indeed decentralized we would need to rely on the security properties of the IC and the IC smart contracts involved. 

We need to really have a big game plan to market this properly. Can't find Eva's name with @ sign but perhaps someone can flag this to her. I think if we don't market the BTC integration WITHIN the BTC communities then we are at risk it is ignored or dismissed. We need the less fundamentalist maxis to take notice. For example, why isn't someone from Dfinity presenting at BTC conferences?

Just want to flag that we really do need to shout from the rooftops about this. And I am wondering if that is only going to happen after the mainnet integration or if now is the time...

Gold has plenty of use, always had since it was first discovered by mankind and nowadays more than ever being used in electronics. A store of value which only value is "price go up" doesn't have much value at all.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-08-04 23:11:32 UTC | #10

Thanks, @diegop.

This is a community driven approach to marketing the btc-integration (as distinguished from advertising mentioned by @paulyoung in https://forum.dfinity.org/t/marketing-ideas/14664). We are simply EXCITED about sharing the news!

The demand for this marketing is so strong...take comments from @shruti tweet...
"I want a t-shirt with this picture on the front"
"I am stealing this if you don't mind"

As @Denis points out, we might antagonize some of bitcoin maximalists. We may not have the terminology just right. 

But fundamentally as ICP fans, i think we really really need to get the news out there front-running everything else (the nuances, analogies, spelling mistakes notwithstanding). The btc-integration IS WORKING! Why not let the world know. There is, currently, a significant gap between the vodoo of cryptography in ICP and the layman's understanding. Who do you think understands (or cares to understand) ECSDA or tECSDA? 

I would love for the foundation to jump in and help. For example, can we have a ready-made deck to help give the complete pitch on IC & IC governance? How about a complete deck on SNS? Community Fund? These decks could be used in community driven camps for advertising(as opposed to marketing).

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-08-04 23:27:23 UTC | #11

I believe that the original poster's comment(which i quoted here) on reddit was his/her indgnation to some r/bitcoin mods calling icp a "s..t coin". So it was a tongue-in-cheek comment; be it be patronizing or not. 

BTC is better than gold. Otherwise why bother?

Your other comments : "stores-of value and analogies is exactly why we need/have a community.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-08-05 00:38:06 UTC | #12

I agree with @dfisher that most BTC maximalists won't trust the integration unless they already trust the IC.

Perhaps the best marketing tool is a viral game that lets users deposit and earn BTC in a completely trustless way. Something social and easy to understand like Wordle―but using real BTC (not even ckBTC).

It would be a prime candidate for hacks. If the game can survive for a few months, then that would put a lot of trust in IC technology IMO.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-05 00:46:25 UTC | #13

I think one of the biggest concerns for skeptics is even if the underlying tech is secure, once the chain holds enough value in BTC, nodes might collude and steal them.

-------------------------

Chloros88 | 2022-08-05 01:54:27 UTC | #14

I mean that's not even remotely possible so why is that a concern?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-08-05 02:39:16 UTC | #15

So the argument is that IC is NOT decentralized enough from a node provider's standpoint AFTER it reaches a threshold value of BTC in the chain (in our case one subnet)?

I think that it is , completely a reasonable thing to think about from a Btcmaxi standpoint. I think that we should be addressing that upfront with numbers. As an example, if we have 35 nodes provided by 5 centralized providers, then the cost to buy 3 of those centralized providers may provide the maximum threshold on the amount of btc to hold on that subnet. Or something like that.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-08-05 03:12:30 UTC | #16

Once the providers decide to collude, what exactly do they have to do to steal the bitcoin?

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-05 03:23:02 UTC | #17

@Zane , never said gold did not have any uses, of course it does. What I said was that it is often handed down across generations without being used, which is just a fact, and proves that stores-of-value do not *need* to be used or spent. The marketing message says, "But really all store-of-values (sic) need to be spent". This is simply untrue and almost guaranteed to get the Bitcoin gang to dismiss everything that comes after.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-08-05 03:43:07 UTC | #18

I agree that " all stores-of-value need to be spent" is an overgeneralization. 

That said, BTC is better than gold in many respects; in particular it's almost infinite (as compared to gold) divisibility & the ability to store and transport it almost effortlessly.

I would say that BTC as a store-of-value is meant to be used/spent. The verb  "spend" is used , most often , to describe the end of an item ( i spent 1$ to buy ice-cream)...but it can also be used to gain something which can later transfered back into btc. For example, i spent 1 btc to provide liquidity for an insurance provider which may return me 10% return (1.1 BTC). 

TBH, when i was thinking about "spend", i was thinking about end of item. My post-facto pseudo defense is after i saw how your point might be valid to btc maxis.

On DFINITY's side of things, they shouldn't really focus on marketing until the product is fully ready to go, to have a product to showcase to everyone rather than showcasing a testnet environment. This is why I'm not really bothered much by any lack of marketing efforts for now.

Let me read through everything carefully and then get back to you. In short, at the current stage, we mainly focus on bringing new devs in. @CarstenJ is currently testing the dev onboarding UX. Bigger campaign is planned when CKBTC is live and we can showcase the full potential

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-05 15:57:08 UTC | #21

@saone-pt in addition to Dfinity presenting at BTC conferences another thought I had was Dom personally reaching out to major BTC mainstream cultural heavy weights. 

For example, Dom should personally reach out to Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen (he is an investor), Chris Dixon, Katie Haun etc etc. and get them to understand how important this is. All people like that have massive platforms and are trusted by a wide audience so I think it would go a long way.

shruti | 2022-08-05 16:35:57 UTC | #22

Thanks everyone for the valuable discussion which has thrown some great ideas on how to create a marketing plan for the BTC integration for the community as well as for Dfinity. I appreciate the feedback on wordings and will keep them in mind for the future! The idea behind this was to take @mparikh's idea to life  - which we managed to do in a small but meaningful way. As mentioned by him if don't get into exact semantics (which may never be perfect!) but the objective of spreading the excitement of the integration, we'll definitely get some influencers, developers, users to take notice! I am throwing my hat in as the go-to person in the community for marketing the BTC integration - next, I  will be work on a simple to understand presentation (as suggested in earlier comments) to start with. I will share it here for your valuable feedback before floating it anywhere! Please hit me up if someone has any ideas which we can work together on!

Thanks very much for the feedback. We definitely want to raise awareness in the BTC scene and are thinking about how we can reach key players and influential people. An invitation for a conversation between Dom and Elon Musk is rather unrealistic for now, unless you know him personally? ;) 

Especially the non-technical people will only jump on it if they see the benefit through use cases. That's why projects like Spinner Cash etc. are so important.

We also need to be aware that we challenge the architecture of some major L2 solutions. Many of the people you mention use and/or participate in them.

-------------------------

pete-hun | 2022-08-08 08:49:53 UTC | #27

It would be more productive to concentrate on engaging BTC developers then to try to have a sensible conversation with the Torquemada like BTC maxis or the average BTC HODLers who only know their green and red candlesticks. Just my opinion.

-------------------------

blockpunk | 2022-08-08 11:00:57 UTC | #28

Agree, the target users of btc integration are not BTC holders, but players who want to earn BTC.

A viral game to help users earn real BTC is a great option, and I think almost all areas of IC Eco need such a viral game to bring in a lot of new users. Then there are really innovative applications.

-------------------------

OVVOVVO | 2022-08-08 13:27:39 UTC | #29

Liam J. Kelly of Decrypt, in his August 6 article, asks readers if bridges, as part of a multi-chain narrative in the world of Defi, are crumbling, given the recent and costly hacks to bridges.

Perhaps efforts can be made to ensure that journalists like him, working at crypto publications, receive important information from Dfinity: "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE".  Apparently Mr Kelly is unaware of the BTC integration happening on the IC, and that it makes bridges obsolete!

In addition, here's an example that underscores the importance of good old fashioned advertising on these sorts of publications:

The primary example of Mr Kelly's "brdges are crumbling" article is that an Avalanche proposal is apparently considering removing their integration with Fantom.  Meanwhile, there's an Avalanche advertisement running in the middle of his article!

It's time for more sophisticated and strategic marketing and advertising aims, so that people who already have an audience are in the know about the incredible innovations happening on the IC, and talk and write about them.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-08 15:53:08 UTC | #30

I don't know Elon Musk but I will bet Marc Andreessen does and Marc is an investor in ICP. I think with the right strategy Dom could get in front of pretty much anyone. It is worth at least trying to have conversations with those high profile people.

Perhaps @saone-pt we (the community) can post on forum about the influential folk's articles; so that we can correct their knowledge about btc integrations? You could see if you/Dom/others have at least SOME of those contacts or contacts-of-contacts in your circle?

-------------------------

pete-hun | 2022-08-08 18:45:49 UTC | #34

Best marketing would be showing BTC integration examples for developers. Hiring a pro Udemy instructor, maybe Angela again to make a tutorial using BTC on the Internet Computer would be the best marketing approach - at least in the long run, but if you want to pump ICP now, probably not so. :slight_smile: 
The most acessible projects will shine in the long run. And the most accessible blockchain projects will be the ones with the most tutorials online from simple to advanced subjects.
Don't shift your attention to traders and investors from developers, traders and investors only invest money while developers invest their most precious asset, their time in your project. They are like spouses compared to a one night stand (trader, investor, gambler). Attract the truly valuable people in the crypto space, the ones who want to create and not the ones who want to win the lottery. Make Internet Computer the most accessible blockchain project of all.

@saone-pt 
I get that bringing in new devs is critical at this stage of the cycle. So I got one of my rust developer friends to give IC a try. The TLDR : even the hello world did not work for her (see paragraph below for details). That was not nice.  Let us (the community) help you to help us. The UX for developers (as with most functions in sw development) is NOT a one-time thing; but a continuous process. Is there a way for us (the community) to integrate into whatever it is that your team is doing? I am sure that folks would be more than eager to help. 

Even the basic https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/languages/rust/rust-quickstart thing did not work for her. Why? Because the structure of the generated program dfx new --type=rust rust_hello changed without the instructions being updated on the site. 

The instruction
 
      dfx canister call rust_hello  greet xyz
should have been 

     dfx canister call rust_hello_backend  greet xyz

This is my fault. I recently updated the SDK (to make it easier to use, based on feedback... ironically enough) and the SDK instructions and I somehow missed this because the Rust SDK had a slightly different structure from Motoko SDK. You can see the PR here: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/2311 (I touched 82 files to get that across the line, but somehow missed an obvious one).

* The SDK is open source. Contributions welcome: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk
* The website dev docs are also open. Contributions welcome: https://github.com/dfinity/portal

Note: in the case you mentioned, some of the documentation is actually in the SDK repo (not the website of docs). The way it works is that docs live in their corresponding code repo and they are all pulled in together.
