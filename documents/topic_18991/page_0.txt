# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires Mac/Linux/WSL2, Git and Podman on your machine.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout 88bc6ab71c9339035b5c169396879c93c10de3d8
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/88bc6ab71c9339035b5c169396879c93c10de3d8/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image,
must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.
