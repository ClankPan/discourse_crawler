I want to test like a user would with a third party wallet. (I know I can add the functionality to the dapp directly without a third party wallet but it just feels more real when the tokens show up in and respond to an independent wallet).

On mainnet, to my knowledge only Bitfinity Wallet currently supports ICRC1s, but it's not available locally.

Is there an expected delivery date or updates on this?

Thanks. It seems there's a misunderstanding. I don't need the wallet to connect to the app. I need the GUI wallet to connect to the local replica, so that the GUI wallet can be used to eg login to a local Internet Identity identity, add an ICRC token found in the local replica, send it to a local address, view the local balance of your local identity, etc.

Basically a GUI toggle inside the wallet itself, like this: https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015290012-Using-a-Local-Node

This should satisfy your requirements, by setting the host to that of your local dfx replica. This is just specified in code rather than through a toggle.

Now I see what it's doing. Yes, it should work this way too.
