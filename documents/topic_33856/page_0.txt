In the basic_bitcoin's lib.rs, multiple_sha256() is added

each function is executed once, the logs looks like

it is very strange, in get_balance(), cycle_used is not zero, but in multiple_sha256(), cycle_used is zero

Has it been considered to measure instructions instead, using [ic_cdk::api::performance_counter](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/fn.performance_counter.html)? 

They are not exactly the same thing since cycles can be charged for [different reasons](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost), but I imagine within the same method you mostly just care about the instructions.

In my case, I hope caller pay exact cycles consumed, just like ethereum does. 
Though I can use [ic_cdk::api::performance_counter](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/fn.performance_counter.html) calculate how many instructions used. I can not convert the instructions consumed to cycles consumed.

`canister_balance` won't help you. You need to use the [gas cost table](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/cost-estimations-and-examples/) together with `performance_counter` and a few heuristics to get the cycles cost. The problem with `canister_balance` is that it doesn't count live cycles deductions, and if you `await` as part of your function then there's a bunch of causes outside of the running function why the `canister_balance` would fluctuate

@Severin Thanks for you clear instructions. I will try this methodã€‚
