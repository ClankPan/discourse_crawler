The examples at https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/simple-to-do have motoko code only, there isn't a front end example.

I found that repo from https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/samples/overview .

In that repo, the developer is told to use `dfx canister call`. That's not how a user would interact with a canister. I'm looking for an example which has

* front end: connects to a user's wallet
* recommendation from Dfinity on what wallet to use included in the example
* basic canister logic that involves saving data from the user & retrieving it

something that feels like a "template" app, rather than a piece of the puzzle.

Hey @nolma , we have a couple sample dapps that include a frontend and authentication through Internet Identity. A few are:

- [Decentralized exchange example](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/samples/dex)
- [Encrypted note taking dapp](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/samples/encrypted-notes)
- [Internet Identity integration sample](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/samples/internet-identity-sample)
