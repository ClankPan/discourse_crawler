I am following these instructions in the documentation to create a `.did` file:

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/generating-candid

I am able to run all of the commands until the last one. When I run the last command `candid-extractor target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/backend.wasm > backend.did`, I receive this error:

`Error: failed to find function export `get_candid_pointer`

What could be wrong?

You probably overlooked some previous steps.

Please make sure that the `ic-cdk` dependency in `Cargo.toml` is v0.11.0 or above.

And make sure that you have this line `ic_cdk::export_candid!();` at the end of the canister source code.
