Who can answer my question?

I have a question: If ICP is a decentralized server, then why are so few projects migrating from AWS to ICP? Is it too expensive, or is it something?

Why not invite large projects like UNISWAP to migrate to the ICP server for free? Isn't this a chance for both sides to win?
