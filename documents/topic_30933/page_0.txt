Now that canister controlled neuron restrictions are being removed, I'd like to see someone build a traditional, immutable canister smart contract (not controlled by a DAO or any party) that is capable of creating and facilitating the transfer of individual neurons.

A **Liquid Neuron Staking Marketplace**

Ideally, this person would take bits and pieces from the NNS frontend and build a similar interface for managing a neuron containing the following features:

- Allow users to log in with II (at a minimum)
- Allow users to create a new neuron, top it up, and manage the neuron
- Allow users to view all of the neurons they currently
- Allow users to list and trade individually staked neurons (not an entire identity) on a marketplace

As long as the contract is well tested and immutable, I would happily pay a 5% fee on top of all transactions. Especially given the ability to earn 8-year staked + age bonus neuron rewards with a liquid neuron.

Depending on the quality of the team/product produced, I would be willing to help crowdfund a significant amount of ICP (10-20k ICP) to see this marketplace become a reality.

Previously, I posted about https://forum.dfinity.org/t/100k-developer-opportunity-ic-dapp-auditing/20166. Several months later, the [Solidstate](https://twitter.com/solidstate_icp) auditing firm was formed. It has already performed several ICP audits, including:

- Neutrinite [DeFi Vectors](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/neutrinite-motion-proposal-accept-confirmation-of-49-175-00-usd-balance-for-solidstate-audit/28379) (~49k USD)
- IC Lighthouse [Pre-SNS Audit](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=hjcnr-bqaaa-aaaaq-aacka-cai&proposal=27) (~119k USD)
- Sonic [Pre-SNS Audit](https://github.com/solidstate-auditing/audits-public/blob/main/SONIC.md?source=post_page-----f89453ac7246--------------------------------) ($$?)

I mention the above in the context that the first, seamless, trustless Liquid Neuron Staking Marketplace is most likely an order of magnitude greater opportunity than auditing.

I 100% support this and would certainly put my non-staked ICP to work if it was available.

We're building something more or less similar: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-waterneuron/30897/3
