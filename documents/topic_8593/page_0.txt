If you follow the instructions from over [here](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity) and deploy II locally for testing, it overwrites the Candid UI canister for your own motoko backend canisters. Probably because both of them get deployed to the same canister ID "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai". What is the prescribed way to solve this? Or is this a bug that should be filed in the II repo?
