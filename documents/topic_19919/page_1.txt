I appreciate the detailed response again. I know there are roadmaps and future features that can be put into place. Very cool ideas if they work out, but my biggest concern is that the messaging your team puts out makes it seem like the app is ready to go right now and the tokens being bought are part of a decentralization sale, when it seems like this is a funding round for an application that might be successful in the future. 
That being said, the moral and legal issues with content moderation are NOT addressed currently. Let's say an extreme example such as someone uploading child abuse or pornography, there doesn't seem to be a process right now of handling that. For someone who is investing their own money into funding this project, that is a big issue. Would have hot or not is sued or taken down because of legal implications, all that invested money disappears because the value of the tokens go to zero. 
I doubt you guys are wanting something like this but it is a real scenario that investors need to be aware of. So I am concerned with some of the messaging around the sale and project

The devil is in the details. They don't have consistent users as the whole users came on a certain date or for a short period which proves that its faked users. Alease they should take some effort to keep this fake users consistently.

Out of the 213,305 they have raised so far from community, 170, 479 came from 2 wallets,. Is it from any VCs for just the team did it for taking 500K CF?

Investment from community is only 42,826 ICP.

I agree with you it seems like the numbers might not be real, and the "users" they are talking about are actually just the number of people who visited the site in one year. But, what is the number of people who really signed up for an account? @rishichadha30 @saikatdas0790

He is talking about this one https://hotornot.notion.site/hotornot/FAQs-Hot-or-Not-SNS-Decentralization-Sale-2c831f632298409f9dbb4a494110e8b5 They can't even include it in the app. They avoid answers and keep lying so don't bother. Anyhow it looks like at this point in time cheating and lying with 90% off chain apps are a good fit for IC and a good showcase on how to fake it till you make it backed by Dfinity.  
The future of SNS looks bright so we should just vote YES on any upcoming proposals even memecoins like Ghost otherwise you get attacked by the Dfinity big dogs.

Honestly, I enjoy PvP. I believe we should express our opinions openly, even if they may offend others. We shouldn't shy away from any confrontations.

I find it intriguing to develop an application and conduct a white-hat social attack on the SNS to test its funding potential. Zack has a valid point worth considering. Even when contemplating my own apps, I'm uncertain about how to verify the authenticity of all users. The concept of proof of personhood was intended to address this issue, but without its implementation, most applications are plagued with bots, some of which may even be created by the developers themselves. This raises the question: what measures must we take to establish its authenticity?

I mean the only thing I can think about is revenue. Like how much money are you making right now. However, most apps will be pre revenue.

It seems that all money investing in HOT OR NOT SNS sale came from same source (Account ID: 88ff5156cc52deb1f9b9a8ccb8ce86f70a155f0af750971cb031d0d29f888872). can anyone explain about this?

Is it the team is creating fake activity to influence community to invest?

Here is the details: https://637g5-siaaa-aaaaj-aasja-cai.icp0.io/ICP/address/88ff5156cc52deb1f9b9a8ccb8ce86f70a155f0af750971cb031d0d29f888872

rishichadha30 | 2023-07-10 14:44:56 UTC | #125

We have experienced rapid growth since the launch of the revamped Hot or Not Dapp in recent months. Our success can be attributed to our ability to convert a significant number of users from web2 platforms and other ecosystems into Hot or Not app users. These users primarily come from countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, and Poland amongst others.

It's important to note that many of these users do not have English as their primary language, and they are often unfamiliar with complex tech platforms. Most of them are transitioning from current social platforms and are particularly drawn to the game-like nature of playing Hot or Not and checking their results on an hourly basis. The gamification aspects of the app are what they find most enjoyable.

Considering that many of our users come from outside the Internet Computer ecosystem, particularly from web2, a significant number have been unable to participate in the ongoing sale due to a lack of understanding about aspects like token swapping, which centralized exchanges to use, how to transfer tokens to the NNS, and what the NNS is, among other factors.

To attract and engage these users within the Hot or Not ecosystem, we have designed a campaign called ‚ÄúA Year of Hotness." In this campaign, we plan to airdrop "seed phrases" directly to the most active users of our dapp, predominantly on a daily basis. Through this gradual process, we aim to introduce them to the governance participation process.

Similar campaigns, such as the one on OpenChat, have already undergone the SNS process and had airdrops. However, due to the requirement for an SNS proposal to pass, the airdrop can only be executed a limited number of times and is more or less impossible to do on a daily basis.

We believe that to effectively add value to the Hot or Not ecosystem, a significant portion of our engagement strategy would involve periodic token airdrops to the most engaged users. Activities such as "posting good content," "using filters for the first time," "downloading our mobile app," "moderating videos," and "opening mystery boxes" amongst others, would be rewarded with token airdrops. This gamified approach incentivizes users to perform these tasks better than others, resulting in token rewards through airdrops.

By effectively distributing locked tokens to the most engaged users, we are decentralizing the platform further. In the future, token recipients will not only be financial investors but also the users who have actively used the app. This is crucial as young startups like ours seek feedback from active users rather than solely token traders.

Airdropping seed phrases directly presents an innovative approach that does not require SNS proposals. By exclusively airdropping to the most engaged Hot or Not users, in the near future, we aim to reduce the barrier to entry for governance participation significantly. This mechanism ensures that only the most active users (a few hundred) can effectively participate in governance.

Furthermore, we are actively working on providing our app in different languages to cater to a broader audience in these countries. This will help users understand how to interact with Internet Identity, the NNS, participate in future SNS projects, engage in governance effectively, and earn rewards for their contributions.

Lastly, we have already reached the minimum participation threshold of 500, so any additional participation in the sale is inconsequential for the team. We also understand Incremental increases in invested amounts of a few thousand ICPs would not help in closing the entire sale as well.

We have been appreciating your feedback always, although we would always like to respond in a more positive and constructive manner.

Firstly, we want to assure you that hard work is indeed our primary focus. As a young startup, we acknowledge that we may not currently possess the extensive resources that some tech giants have. However, we are committed to working tirelessly to demonstrate the value of our efforts. It is important to us that individuals like yourself recognize the dedication required to accomplish what we have set out to do.

We understand that your intention may have been to convey a particular message, and we acknowledge that using more respectful and inclusive language can foster healthier discussions within the community. We believe that maintaining a positive environment for everyone involved allows for better collaboration and progress.

Our aim is to demonstrate, over time, that we are here for the long run, making HotOrNot into a community-owned project of substantial scale. We strive to take it to new heights and provide a platform that positively impacts the community as a whole.

Thank you once again for sharing your thoughts, and we encourage you to engage in open and constructive dialogue moving forward. 

We genuinely wish you the best of luck in all your endeavours.

Moderation of "soft-something" content is nothing more than censorship. You can optionally introduce it as an optional option for creators to not break their copyrights or to make it easier for them to automatically monetize (example: YouTube content ID) but not to block "body art". It isn't the purpose of Web3 Dapps to treat its users like children of the Web2 world under 18 y/o.
Let's be censorship resistant.

I want to make clear with this statement that my thoughts are my own and not on behalf of any organization or influence. Especially now with my involvement with BoomDAO, which I support. BoomDAO has many parties that may differ in opinions, but its my understanding that the BoomDAO founders support Hot or Not

Also I want to say that I don't NOT support Hot or Not. I just wanted to be able to communicate some concerns and clear up some assumptions due to millions of dollars being on the line. From what Ive seen in the community, decentralization sale == being able to decentralize after the sale rather than a funding round to get to that point, thats all.
I wish the Hot or Not the best, it seems like their Roadmap is great and love some of the tokenomics and design of what the app could be. I just disagree with the marketing of the current state of the product, though it can have potential to be great. If the hot or not dapp does well, I do well because the ecosystem does well. I think its healthy to have discussions about concerns so that the ecosystem is healthy.

Hey Gekctek! 

Thanks for posting this clarification, we appreciate it. As one of the founders of BOOM DAO, I want to state clearly that we wholeheartedly support HotOrNot and have a great relationship with Rishi and the team. I met them personally on a trip to San Francisco and they're an incredibly professional and solid team with massive plans in store for HotOrNot. At BOOM DAO, we truly believe in uniting the IC ecosystem and adopting a positive-sum mindset where we can support and foster network effects for all ICP projects. A rising tide lifts all boats. We've always celebrated HotOrNot publicly and hope for the long-term success of HotOrNot to onboard millions to the IC! Kudos on the successful SNS sale :slight_smile:

Hi Hot or Not team. Previously you released some user stats prior to the SNS sale. I have a few questions, if you are will to release this information.

1. How do the Google analytics user stats look since the SNS sale?
2. How many of these users have logged into the service, and how many Internet identities unique principals are there that have logged in? Do you have this data in time series?

-------------------------
