[Hot or Not](https://hotornot.wtf/) is preparing to launch its SNS DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale expected soon.

This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the Hot or Not SNS and ask the founding team any questions.

Hot or Not is Web3's answer to TikTok. It is a short-video social media platform that integrates gamification for short video content.

We aim to tackle the intrinsic issues that have created an unequal and biased ecosystem in traditional social media. These issues around monetization and centralization are detailed below.

### Problem Statement

The current social ecosystem is built on the monetization of attention with the needs of advertisers in mind. Consequently, it is designed to keep the concentration of dollars within advertisers and platform owners. In 2021, only 2% of the $150 billion ad revenue was distributed to users.

### Hot or Not Platform

Hot or Not combines the best of social media, gamification, and decentralization to revolutionize the short-video social media ecosystem which leads to equitable distribution of wealth among all the stakeholders of the social ecosystem including all the users of the social platform. This presents a multi-billion dollar market opportunity that has remained untapped by the existing social media ecosystem.

Our vision is to promote a more equitable and democratic social media ecosystem that prioritizes freedom of expression and resists censorship from Big Tech. We strive to empower individuals and communities to participate in shaping the online landscape while fostering a culture of respect, inclusivity, and accountability.

Here is the link to the [Hot or Not SNS Whitepaper](https://hotornot.notion.site/Hot-or-Not-Whitepaper-c539179e51f44867979f4372e4635f59). Please read the whitepaper beforehand as hopefully, it will already contain many of the answers.

### Funding Target

* As detailed in our whitepaper, we are targeting a minimum of 1,000,000 ICP to a maximum of 2,000,000 ICP.
* We are seeking 400,000 ICP - 500,000 ICP from the Community Fund. We will strictly adhere to the guideline that limits the Community Fund’s contribution to a maximum of 10% of the total maturity of the Community Fund at the time of submission.

More details about the distribution and SNS configuration can be found in [this section](https://www.notion.so/hotornot/Hot-or-Not-Whitepaper-c539179e51f44867979f4372e4635f59?pvs=4#4aabd39455c64135bb976ed5121f1ac3) of the whitepaper.

We are excited to launch our SNS and what lies ahead for Hot or Not and the IC!

How do Hot or Not NFT holders factor into the SNS token sale?

-------------------------

rishichadha30 | 2023-05-12 08:46:15 UTC | #3

Hi @JaMarco, This is Rishi from the Hot or Not team. 

The Hot or Not NFT (Funded) holders would be receiving liquid HOT tokens in the Plug Wallets. We'll be putting out more information about the same soon :slight_smile:

-------------------------

ildefons | 2023-05-12 08:52:11 UTC | #4

Is it possible to have the NFT in a Stoic Wallet or should I move it to a Plug Wallet?

-------------------------

courage7710 | 2023-05-12 08:59:12 UTC | #5

On the hot or not videos the Coins received what will it be equivalent to

-------------------------

rishichadha30 | 2023-05-12 09:10:33 UTC | #6

Hi @ildefons We would be posting more information about this on our social handles, but we’ll be supporting Plug wallet initially.

-------------------------

rishichadha30 | 2023-05-12 09:12:58 UTC | #7

Hi @courage7710 The COYN token value would be determined by the market forces once it gets listed on the DEXs in the IC ecosystem initially. There is a game proposed in the white paper where in the COYN tokens would be utilised in order to unlock the same to transfer it to the exchanges.

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-05-12 10:09:48 UTC | #11

What month are you planning to starts your SNS D-Sale?
I'm asking because from what I know, the current maturity of CF neurons is about 4 M, and you want to collect as much as 600 k, which is over 10%. For me it is perfectly acceptable, but from what I know DFINITY strongly recommends that it be max. 10% of the total currently available maturity.
In addition, this month, AFAIK, 2 launches are coming. This will definitely reduce this value and - retail investors may haven't more money after buying 2 new SNS projects, which reduces decentralization and the potential to collect a sufficient and satisfactory amount of ICP in the current month (May).

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2023-05-12 10:47:16 UTC | #12

So we need to transfer it to Plug if it is in other wallet?

You have the same problem as kinic. The current product experience is not very good, but you are asking for so much money. This is out of proportion. Please optimize the product first and show the strength of the team before launching.

DHemingway | 2023-05-13 21:00:57 UTC | #18

I like the opting into watching-advertisements to earn HOT tokens idea!

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-05-18 20:58:54 UTC | #19

The state of Montana in the USA made a new law (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/17/business/montana-tiktok-ban.html) making TikTok illegal within its borders. This law goes into effect on January 1st, 2024. 

Does Hot Or Not have a plan to capitalize on the decentralization aspect of Hot or Not post SNS sale? It’s seems like a golden opportunity and low-hanging fruit to market the product to these specific geo locations where TikTok has been banned. I would like to see this added to white paper. 

Cheers

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-05-18 23:35:02 UTC | #20

I'd suggest avoiding as much controversy as possible and setting community fund to 0. I don't think the decentralization benefit is worth the headache with the current process. 

Good luck!

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-05-18 23:46:29 UTC | #21

Have you expanded on this idea anywhere else?  Will you please provide a link?  I saw you make a similar post on Twitter.  I don’t understand why setting the community fund to zero would avoid controversy.  It seems to me that the ICP community is going to find controversy in any attempt at a SNS decentralization sale.

-------------------------

rishichadha30 | 2023-05-19 01:29:29 UTC | #22

Hey @DHemingway This is wonderful news for us for sure. We'll add this to the heading of the white paper itself. Thank you for supporting us always. Really appreciate the same.

skilesare | 2023-05-19 04:11:08 UTC | #23

I think the CF is seen as "free money". Everyone is moving fast because the pile gets smaller with each sale. There is no new vote by the CF to participate. The daos just get to decide a number. 

If there is no CF then every dollar that goes in is a considered dollar and an active "Investment". 

I think the CF can be pretty cool, but right now it seems like a bowl of candy left out for Halloween and kids are coming by and taking way more the allotted 1 piece per person.  That instantly gets you bad vibes and puts people on the defensive.

jwarner | 2023-05-19 04:30:05 UTC | #24

Hello, I have a couple questions.

From the FAQ’s on the web site:

> Currently, there is no way to delete an account already created. You can change your Profile Picture and your Profile Name on your existing account. You can also create another account with a new Internet Identity, but this does not remove your videos from the platform. A video once uploaded cannot be deleted as of now, this service may be made available in the future.

Can you give a technical explanation on why people cannot delete their accounts?

In your FAQ, under “**What type of content is prohibited**?” question, it says to refer to the community guidelines in the Terms of Service. But, when I go to the Terms of Service, I see “**You have also accepted the Hot or Not [privacy policy link], and our [ community guidelines link]**” which leads me to believe there is supposed to be links to policies there, but there are none except placeholding text. So as of right now, everything goes?

I don’t see any information at all on how to contact the company if there is a problem or if someone needs support? I’m just using the desktop version and am not sure if that’s the case across Android an IOS as well. Where is the support page for people who need customer service?

Is there any information on the current company structure? Who built the app? Github?

Looks like a good idea/dapp, but I can’t find any hard information on anyone who has worked on it, or is working on supporting it? You’re trying to raise over $5 million USD, but I am struggling to find out who you are. I might just be looking in the wrong spot. If the info is out there, please throw it my way! Thanks.

wpb | 2023-05-19 05:10:47 UTC | #25

Interesting.  It’s an investment of ICP maturity, which people could cash out into any fiat they want within 7 days at will.  Hence, I don’t see it as free money.  If a project asks for too much of the CF, then they are not likely to succeed at the sale.  I struggle with this characterization of the CF in the same way that I struggle with project “over valuation” arguments that I see from the community.  The value of the project is what people are willing to pay and we won’t know that until the sale is complete.  If the project asks too much, then the bids will not raise enough and the SNS will not form.  Every ICP or maturity ICP that goes into these sales has real, liquid value and I don’t think people invest it lightly.  Yes, an SNS is a high risk investment just like all startups, but it’s real money on the line nonetheless.  I guess I’d rather let the market decide the value of a project and if they are asking too much from the CF.  I know we have several projects in the queue for SNS, but it seems they will all be hard.  I suspect the CF will not run out.  It will be interesting to watch as projects try to figure out a fair market value for the community of investors.

[/quote]

Might these two statement contradict each other? If the community pushes back because the ask from the CF is too high isn’t that the same as saying that they perceived it to be valued too high?

Edit: I should probably clarify that I have no real input on the valuation. I have no expertise there. The reason I would agree with @skilesare is because I feel that it’s my responsibility as a stakeholder to safeguard those funds. The SNS topic happens to be the one proposal type where I feel like my vote matters. If someone is going to ask for those funds I think it’s the responsibility of all active stakeholders to apply appropriate levels of skepticism and ask questions (respectfully).

Hello! Hot or Not seems like an interesting project. I was just curious if I could find the valuation method the team has used, determining a raise of 1-2m ICP. Not saying this is an inaccurate, invalid, or misrepresents valuation - just hoping to see the math behind it, to gauge the extrapolation of the valuation, and near term profitability for community fund participants. Thanks in advance!

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-19 20:37:15 UTC | #28


The token economics of HOTORNOT looks bad, content creators have less rights in HOT governance, and the project side allocates another coin COYN for content creators, which is a falling coin with an infinite inflationary death spiral, with The value of COYN dropped by 99%, this project has no appeal to new players, people might as well use tiktok!

I think they are different, but to each their own.  When it comes to valuation and CF allocation, I prefer to let the market decide if the project has asked too much.  Others are free to make that decision through governance.

Hi! This is Utkarsh from the Hot or Not founding team.

We have revised the allocation for the Community Fund in the SNS Sale based on the guidelines provided by Dfinity in this post: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543.

It's important to mention that we will strictly adhere to the guideline that limits the Community Fund's contribution to a maximum of 10% of the total maturity of the Community Fund at the time of submission. For more information on the updated allocation, please refer to the whitepaper.

Moreover, we have addressed concerns pertaining to user data security and potential vulnerabilities by including additional information in the FAQ document that was previously shared. Please feel free to review the same.

Hi Hot or Not team, At the time of funded they declared you had raised $200k and now you’ve put funded holders in the same category as seed investors. Funded guys get 0.27% allocation and I’m assuming the rest goes to these guys who gave them this $200k. Why the hueeeegee! difference in valuation in this same category? It’s more than 30X. They get 9.4% allocation for $200k. Now look at funded guys they get 0.27% allocation for 10k ICP or $40k. You didn’t disclose the valuation at which you raised, how much they raised from different inevstors, when they raised etc. There seems to be no mention of that in the WP.

Also funded guys are being allocated tokens at the lower ICP prices. I would get more tokens had I just kept my ICP with me and not funded your nfts. The additional benefits you guys talk of are worth a few ICP in the market (gob gob/nphone/Coyns). The thing that matters is HOT tokens and you've shortchanged us on that. Won't fly well with SNS investors as well. Better revise the funded allocation to 2.5-3% and do right by the community.

ajismyid | 2023-06-01 02:22:40 UTC | #42

Just my two cents = HotorNot Team should consider to discard adopting COYN for the in-game economy. It is useless & has zero value outside the dapp. Adopt other popular cryptocurrencies instead, use ckBTC, ckETH, ICP, or something else that is popular. Also consider rewarding in HOT token for the content creators. Content creators deserve more voices to direct the future of the dapp.

Hello, as per comments of some users, is the below $COYN circulating supply estimation (from Whitepaper) still valid?
Would you consider changing of the bet amounts from **`10`-`50`-`100`** to **`1`-`5`-`10`** or setting some **limit on daily bets per user** - to **prevent too high inflation**?

Hello guys,
When I look into your whitepaper, it seems that you will mint 10% additional tokens in the first year and reduce gradually to 5 within 10 years . So within 10 years the total supply will be around 1.7 Billion>
How you keep stabilize the token price ? This might leads to a bloodbath in the market.

I guess the official level will definitely be adopted, and the higher the level, the higher the amount of COYN that can be sold. A strict calculation is carried out based on sales volume, market output, and burning volume.

We sincerely thank you for providing us with your valuable feedback. We greatly appreciate your support and would like to express our gratitude by offering exclusive rewards to our Funded NFT holders. As a token of our appreciation, we have decided to reward Funded NFT holders with a special airdrop of 330,000 HOT tokens, surpassing all other seed investors.

Furthermore, in addition to the airdrop, we will be allocating COYN tokens to all NFT holders based on the tier of NFT purchased by Funded holders. The allocation will be as follows: 5000, 10000, and 20000 COYN tokens, setting Funded NFT holders apart from other seed investors.

We are excited to announce that funded NFT holders will also gain access to our gamified NFTs and NFTs from our inaugural collection, GobGob. Depending on the tier, they will receive 5, 15, or 30 unique NFTs. These in-game NFTs hold immense value as they are an integral part of our product and are anticipated to command significant prices, potentially reaching hundreds of dollars.

It's important to note that Funded NFT holders will have liquid $HOT tokens, unlike any other category, including seed investors. This advantage enables them to trade their tokens as soon as they are unlocked following the SNS.

HotOrNot has experienced remarkable growth within the entire ecosystem, thanks to the unwavering support from individuals like yourself. Our goal of becoming the largest social DAO in the world, extending beyond the ICP ecosystem, is within reach with your continued support. We are confident that our growth will lead to substantial returns for our investors, particularly our initial supporters.

Moreover, I want to assure you that the HotOrNot team is actively exploring additional avenues and advantages to provide our funded token holders. Your support from day one has been invaluable, and we are committed to exceeding your expectations.

We are currently exploring the possibility of introducing a dedicated Lifelong All Access Hot or Not Founders Pass NFT, exclusively available to a core group of most active users and only Funded NFT holders. This pass would grant access to all parts of the HotOrNot DApp without the need to participate in the game, allowing these select users to monetize all incentives from Day 1. It's important to note that this privilege would be limited to only a few hundred users out of the hundreds of thousands of users and even millions of users in the future, on the app.

These Lifelong All Access passes will be designed as NFTs, following a tiered structure similar to the Funded NFTs. The base price for these passes is planned to be in the hundreds of dollars, with the highest tier commanding a base price in the thousands of dollars. We anticipate that it will take a few weeks to finalize the details before we can roll out this exciting feature. Once implemented, this will establish Funded NFT holders as lifelong standouts within the Hot or Not DApp, distinguishing them from all other users in perpetuity.

We understand the significance of this opportunity and are committed to ensuring a fair and rewarding experience for our dedicated supporters. We will continue to work diligently to fine-tune the details of this exclusive offering, keeping the best interests of our Funded NFT holders in mind.

Your outstanding support and dedication to the HotOrNot platform are immensely appreciated. Once again, thank you for your unwavering support.

I love the calm and composed manner you've chosen to reply with. There are only a few qualms left in me the major of which would be relieved after knowing the valuations at which seed round investors invested.

I'd love for the ration of funded airdrop be increased to atleast 2.5-3% because 0.27% for us funded holders is just a disgrace when even the airdrop is 1%. I don't care about liquid tokens. Lock it into neurons for all I care, 2 year, 3 year that's fine. I believed in the project for the long term and to not have enough governance tokens would Suck. You can have a poll for funded holders whether they want liquid tokens or more staked tokens?

I think we all agree to the potential of hot or not. That's why having the governance control to the right group of early supporters is good not just for us but for project as well because we believed in you from day 1. Anyday more tokens over liquid tokens.

In the current alpha dapp it seems you will always win if you vote HOT. Is this a feature and not a bug?
Is it expected to change in future?
Thanks!

Hi Rishi,

What is the # of NPhones NFT's that will be minted initially? I'm assuming these will all be Level 1 NFT's with the exception of Funded Tier 2 & 3 NFT holders being given Level 10 & 25 respectively. 

How much additional ICP will be raised from the sale of NPhones NFT's or will HOT or COYN tokens be used to purchase them and subsequently burned? 

What is the price (in ICP) of a Level 1 NPhone NFT expected to be at launch?

Post decentralization sale, will the Hot or Not Dao have to vote to mint and sell additional NPhones if needed to align with growth? 

To withdraw COYN from the platform an NPhone NFT is required? If I'm understanding correctly the number of COYN you can withdraw from the platform both in quantity and frequency is dependent on the Level of the NPhone NFT, is this correct?

How does someone raise their level of NPhone NFT or are the levels set in stone?

What is the time-frame for implementing withdrawals of COYN from the platform?

Thank you for helping me understand the value of NPhone NFT.

-------------------------

rishichadha30 | 2023-06-26 12:12:32 UTC | #66

Hi @DHemingway,

Regarding the initial minting of NPhones NFTs, there were several concepts and ideas considered. The Hot or Not protocol, post the SNS, will manage the exact number of Phone NFTs. Initially, we proposed that around 20 to 25% of the entire user base would be able to mint Level 1 phone NFTs. However, the final decision will be made through the Hot or Not SNS DAO, where there will be a forum for users to discuss and vote on proposals.

You can think of the Phone NFTs as having a similar function to the Dissolve Delay feature in the NNS. As you level up, the Dissolve Delay decreases, allowing you to cash out the Maturity, which, in this case, refers to COYN tokens. The proposal suggests that only 20% of COYN token holders will be able to cash out their tokens, while the remaining 80% will need to purchase at least a Level 1 NFT to unlock their COYN tokens.

Since the Level 1 NFTs will be limited to 20-25% of the entire user base, the price of the Level 1 NFT will fluctuate based on market demand. Additionally, any purchase of any Level NFT will result in burning COYN tokens. Holding multiple NFTs at different levels will not be possible. If you purchase a higher-level NFT, you will need to burn a lower-level NFT, and specific gamified rules for this process will be designed and approved by the community members of the Hot or Not DAO.

The higher-level NFTs will be even rarer, representing a lower percentage of all users on the platform. This limited nature of the NFTs will increase their value, with prices being influenced by market demand.

Please note that the rules governing the Phone NFTs game will be open to discussion and subject to the input and feedback of the community. These rules will only be implemented upon the successful execution of proposals through the SNS DAO, ensuring that the specifications of the Phone NFTs remain adaptable to change based on community feedback. We value the active participation of the community in shaping the future of the Phone NFT ecosystem.

I am curious about the status of the name Hot or Not. It seems like a likely vector for future issues as a website with that name is well known, and is likely trademarked. Has the forming team looked into this or answered about this somewhere? 

*Not sure if this is relevant to the immediate swap but more for the future of the project.

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-07-04 08:29:24 UTC | #72

I'm wondering if this project isn't just a scam. They lie that people wanted the airdrop to be postponed continuously, they cheat on the number of users and steal someone else's trademark.
It's all like one big pump&dump. Therefore, no whale invests in it.

plsak | 2023-07-04 09:06:43 UTC | #73

I think this is a long running ICP project with real product so hope all is fine, but not communicating about such important topics during this (SNS funding) phase is kinda bit miss, hopefully it will get fixed or there is some other plan.

For the airdrop, I think it should either finish before the SNS or start after SNS is launched - it seems to me that a lot of people are now relying on the reward rather than participating in the sale - as per low number of `Current Total Participants`:

If they met the airdrop deadline this time, it will definitely end BEFORE SNS Launch, because they failed to attract participants, not to mention larger investors (except automated NNS Funding).

rishichadha30 | 2023-07-04 10:41:29 UTC | #76

Hello there, thank you so much for your question. We're excited to share some wonderful achievements and updates with you about the Hot or Not Dapp.

First and foremost, we are proud to emphasize that our platform is designed to be user-friendly and inclusive. We firmly believe in offering freedom to our users, and that's why we don't mandate logging in or creating an account through Internet Identity to use the Hot or Not Dapp. We want everyone to feel comfortable and welcome when engaging with our platform.

Over the past 8 months, we've witnessed remarkable growth, making Hot or Not Dapp the fastest-growing DApp in the entire ICP ecosystem. This milestone is even more impressive considering we achieved it with ZERO marketing spend. Our team has put in tremendous effort, working over 100 hours per week, to create a platform that benefits everyone as a public good, co-owned by thousands, potentially millions, of users worldwide. The continuous support from the ICP community has been instrumental in our success, and we're deeply grateful for it.

Let's talk numbers! Currently, Hot or Not Dapp boasts an astounding user base of over 112,000+ users, and we're confident this number will grow even further in the coming months. We've become the second-highest canister holder among all projects in the Internet Computer Ecosystem, and it's essential to note that we achieved this without being incubated by Dfinity themselves. Our subnet showcases an impressive collection of Hot or Not User canisters, reflecting the popularity and engagement on our platform.

The impact we've made on the ICP ecosystem is evident by the fact that Hot or Not Dapp accounts for 20%-40% of all cycles being burnt across the entire ICP network. This emphasizes not only the significance of our platform but also how much the Hot or Not DAO will contribute to the Internet Computer ecosystem in the future.

One of our proudest achievements is the massive volume of organic video content generated by our users. To date, more than 120,000+ videos have been uploaded, solidifying Hot or Not as one of the leading Dapps in terms of video content. Additionally, the Hot or Not voting game has been played over 4.5 Million+ times in just a few weeks since its launch, further highlighting the genuine and natural engagement of our users.

Looking ahead, we have ambitious plans to reach one million users in the next few months and eventually grow to ten million users. We are well aware of the diverse preferences of our user base, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria, where mobile applications are highly popular. As a result, we'll be launching mobile applications for iOS and Android to cater to these preferences and expand our reach.

To achieve these impressive milestones, we have relied on the organic growth of our platform, driven by the inherent vitality and virality aspects built into the Dapp. We haven't spent even a single dollar on crypto influencers or events because we firmly believe that the key to success lies in creating a product that users genuinely want, and the results speak for themselves.

At its core, Hot or Not started as an exciting experiment to engage people in determining the popularity of videos through community voting. The intersection of gaming and social interactions has opened new doors for us, and we're excited to grow these numbers exponentially in the coming years.

We're also thrilled to share that Hot or Not Dapp has attracted attention and users from various ecosystems, including #near, #solana, and #polygon, reinforcing its widespread appeal and popularity.

We want to address any misconceptions and assure our community that we remain committed to our core values of hard work, passion, and transparency. Our results and dedication will always speak for us.

Please note that the above screenshot is from our Google Analytics dashboard and since it is client side JS analytics client, it will under-report events as many users will be using ad-blockers/Brave browser. But we can get an approximate idea of the actual figures by comparing with other metrics.

![image|690x244](upload://7ODIBrnESTseIOun0W8H3xtXJ6S.png)

![image|690x422](upload://dofj00kJYY4COxCEl7sOuIeKP4a.png)

From the above 2 screenshots we can see that Google Analytics reported total videos uploaded as **96K** while the actual accurate value from our CDN backend is actually **120K**. Which means that our actual numbers are **25%** higher.

So, going by the same, our actual user numbers are 

```
93 * 1.25 = 116,000+ users
```

[quote="rishichadha30, post:76, topic:19919"]
4.5 Million+ times
[/quote]

Finally, the same for the above:
![image|690x244](upload://jBVjyetbfwIKb3knNL1UDxmztUU.png)

So, actual number of votes placed:

```
4.5 * 1.25 = 5.3 Million+ votes placed
```

Please note that the numbers shared by Rishi are conservative estimates based on earlier shared numbers but the above are numbers that stand currently till 30th of the last month.

Gekctek | 2023-07-04 19:38:04 UTC | #86

The following is my subjective experience and is meant to give my take on the Hot or Not app. I have no inside knowledge and I have not been in contact with the developers. I may miss things or get some things wrong, so I would say to do your own research. Also if I get anything wrong, let me know so i can correct it.

I have been following this Hot or Not/GoBazzinga app for a while and its never added up for me. The idea is to take on TikTok/short form video content platforms but in a decentralized way. Hot or Not seems to take the approach of using tokenomics to support content creators and use predictions to get the best videos to go viral while rewarding the curators/betters of the video along with the creator of the video. All this done on a platform that is owned and controlled by the users (pure decentralization). That sounds great but there seems to be a few issues in my mind.

Monetization - Where is the money coming from?  
According to their FAQ, the money will be coming from consuming users directly:

> The current app is the alpha version which does not contain the Hot or Not monetization system. This will be added to the platform in the coming months, in accordance with GoBazzinga's Dfinity grant milestones. The platform will contain an in-app game called “Hot or Not”. Users can stake their COYN tokens on any video, on either “Hot” or “Not” outcomes, depending on their thoughts on the viral capacity of the video. If the user stakes their token on the side of the majority, they win and earn double their tokens back. If the user stakes their tokens on the minority side, they lose all the tokens staked on that particular video. Hot or Not also monetises content creation without relying on advertisers, by giving 10% of all tokens staked to the creator of the video, regardless of the outcome.

I see a lot of 'staking' terminology being thrown around in the blockchain space, but I rarely see it being used in a sustainable way, except at protocol levels. This is literally just betting money on videos, where the content creator will get a cut. Even if we ignore any bad effects of young people betting money on videos they think will go viral, I am not aware of anyone wanting to do that. 

When you go onto the app you get a little bit of tokens  for free so there is no friction and a new user can start betting. Where are those tokens coming from? My guess is there is inflation/user onboarding costs to grow the application. This is not a sustainable model and would devalue any tokens you bought or invested in. Is that going to change? What happens when tokens are given to users that just log in once and arent spending them?

My biggest problem with this model is I dont see where the value is coming from. The only use for the tokens is to bet on the virality of videos. So that means it relies purely on user demand to define what the value of the tokens are and it assumes that people want to BUY them. As far as I can tell, no one has to buy any to use the service, just if they want to bet and have blown through the initial tokens that were gifted. How many people are demanding to bet on videos with real money? Even if the site was popular and there was good content, are people going make their income by scrolling through videos and betting money if its going to go viral? Maybe, but that is a very untested theory. 

TikTok/Algorithms
The power of something like tiktok is the algorithm which figures out what YOU want, not what everyone else likes. No two tiktok feeds are the same because no two people are the same. Just having a video platform that allows for short term content, not only has been done, but has been done many times and failed. The only 'magic sauce' that I see in this app is the betting, and mentioned above that is a gamble (pun INTENDED) even if the content is good and there is a user base.

Incentives
Tokenomics design should be used to align incentives and create a cooperative space. This instead seems like its encouraging people to choose the most clickbait-y/spam videos, rather than ones they actually like. Also this is an absolute global value where a video is liked by the whole world. Good content that is more niche for specific communities would never 'win' because they are niche. So this just encourages videos that arent necessarily what you want to see. I personally dont want to see the global 'trending' videos, I want to watch the videos that are curated to me.

Moderation/Copyright
There seems to be ZERO moderation on this application. From my experience MORE than HALF of the videos are just women in very little clothing and posing in very provocative manners. Not only that but the users who are posting them seem to just be posting random clickbait they have found vs the content they have created. Either that or the users have a lot of friends they take videos of that are viral in nature. Besides it being a bunch of sexual clickbait/spam, what about copyright. Who owns these videos? Who is taking them down or handling the situation where the rightful owner is not getting compensated? Is this also going to turn into where I can split up a movie into 100 clips and make money off of them just because I uploaded them? Sites like tiktok cant even handle this, its a hard problem, so why would this app be able to.

Content Creators
Where are they? I have yet to find a single video that isnt just a clickbait video that is probably taken from another service. I dont even see any ICP videos on this service, is anyone really even making content for it?

Cloudflare

> Everything on the app is stored on-chain, with the exception of the videos and profile pictures, which are hosted on Cloudflare. We are awaiting the storage subnets so that we can later put these things on-chain as well. On this forum, at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-storage-subnets-proposal/9390, you can read more about the storage subnets. User experience, cost, and simplicity were taken into consideration when choosing Cloudflare over non-ICP on-chain services like IPFS. Our roadmap outlines our goal of becoming entirely on-chain as we are committed to creating a decentralised system where users have complete control over their data and content.

WHAT??? The videos are not on the IC? They are just hosted on cloudflare. Who is paying for that? If this app becomes 'decentralized' and the creators leave, who is paying the bill and handling the accounts? None of this makes sense. If you are going to be asking for money from IC ecosystem, at least have the ability to actually be decentralized, otherwise just ask for donations or work with a VC

Video Creation Functionality
This is where I was super shocked. I went to upload a video and I couldnt do ANYTHING with it. I cant even find it. Apparently you cannot delete, edit or even VIEW you videos that you have uploaded it. So if you are looking for a Web3 experience where you 'own' or 'control' your data, stay away.
From FAQ:

> The facility of making edits to a video created within the app is not yet available. This feature will be added in the coming months, including text addition, sounds library, and stickers among other facilities.


Conclusion
The only thing I could see from this app that could make it worth while to invest time or money is if there was some sort of blockchain/web3 traits such as being able to connect with other similar services, being able to build on top of it or have some sort of unique feature that would bring value to content creators/content consumers. But to me all this seems like is a tiktok clone with little to no creators where you can place bets on clickbait videos.
I dont mean to discourage anyone in the IC community from making applications, but when money gets involved things change. If the creators are asking for money, then the application should bring value, but I see none here. This is especially jarring when there has been so much marketing around how big and amazing this application has been. Also when Dfinity has been showing off Hot or Not as a top application in the space, but I know of no one who uses or has any interest in using it.
I personally discourage anyone from jumping into this sale without really looking into the value that this brings to the space. I personally will not be buying any tokens

Most of the people in the comments are very hypocritical. While saying that they support IC, they have been rejecting every project that works hard on IC. You must know that hotornot is almost one of the most valuable projects on IC. Can you find another one besides it? ? For your so-called problem, I can also find dozens of reasons against BTC, so shouldn’t BTC exist? If you're an IC supporter, I suggest you shut up, if you're not, you can leave! The seemingly reasonable reasons you mentioned are also applicable to any blockchain project. The blockchain project itself does not need a token, right? Why don’t you refute ETH?

[/quote]

I do. But, since I'm a small retail investor, I have to be selective about what I support. If I had a lot more money, I might be a little more frugal with my investments. In my mind, projects like this are for individuals with VC money that can take larger risks. It's nothing against the team, as I'm sure they worked very hard to get where they are. I'm guessing some of us just don't want to take the risk. The valid points made by @Gekctek don't look like "nonsense" to me. I appreciate the effort by everyone contributing as much information as possible, good and bad.

Supporting every single project that comes along would be doing a disservice to the protocol as a whole, in my opinion. Most of them are going to die. I think the concept and structure of ICP is awesome, and it has a ton of potential. I don't need to buy in to projects to support it.

@icper  I can get your frustration. I also want all the apps in the ecosystem to be great and thrive. Not every app is going to be like that and we should embrace the fact that we can be stewards of the IC and do our due diligence and question things. I love the idea of an IC tiktok, but I dont think this is it. Doesn't mean it can't get there. But since they are asking for a LOT of money from regular people like us, its best to check to make sure their claims match the application itself.
As to your comment:
[quote="icper, post:94, topic:19919"]

On the contrary, I am a big supporter of the IC. In fact, my job is dependent on it being good. I mainly develop Motoko libraries or other tools to help other build cool things. I need the IC to have good dapps. 
You say we need to support these projects, but what if some dapp comes out (not necessarily Hot or Not) and it is not what they say and makes the IC look bad and hurts the community. I want to make sure that things are out in the open so that people can make a decision for themselves.

@borovan Im not sure what specifically you are addressing. What specifically is nonsense? I am open to discussion and editing any incorrect ideas in my post. 
I very much want killer Dapps, that's why I am doing my due diligence.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-07-05 03:34:03 UTC | #97

Obviously hotornot must be one of the killer projects, if the IC community can fund its growth, I think it has the potential to become huge! But the team needs someone stronger to operate the project! The prospect of hotornot is definitely better than any current sns project, short video is hot, and web2 is also verifying this point of view! If hotornot can't reach the ideal state, any ambitious team can also make the 'tiktok 2' project, but before that, I support hotornot unconditionally!

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-07-05 04:14:01 UTC | #98

This is not a rational argument to @Gekctek concerns.

I do happen to disagree on the perspective that he has; but NOT with the basic facts. Nothing that follows is legal or financial advice. It should be used for educational/entertainment purpose only.

My basic perspective starts from the fact that dapps that are looking for funding through SNS are essentially start-ups; NOT established businesses. There's inherent tremendous risk in investing in any startup.   For example,  @Gekctek mentions that there is not, currently,  a segmentation of different topics for voting (it's a global one topic). Well, if the market demands it, i suppose it can be possible in the future to update the voting mechanism....again these are startups not established businesses. 

Similar arguments can be made for several different arguments that he has made. But it doesn't negate his thought process (it's  too risky for him). It may not be too risky for someone else.

His purpose is very clear. In the last sentence, he expressed his hope to call on anyone not to invest in this project! If everyone in the IC community is like this, criticizing every SNS project too much, IC really can't be strong again! Any of us should be tolerant of every SNS project, at least they are building an ecology through their efforts! Anyone should understand that if the sns project reaches 100, the market value of ICP can at least advance 20

That's fair. I see your point. It feels like SNS sales get labeled as 'decentralizaion sale' and it's perceived that after that is decentralized, which it's not. I would encourage people to fund startups in this ecosystem, but its being marketed as it's in a usable and popular state vs needing funding to get a good product. If that's their messaging then i don't think i would have as much of a problem with it. And nothing on the roadmap suggests to me that some of these issues would be addressed. 
Thank you for being civil @Icdev2dev lol. It's nice to have meaningful conversation about something that we all care about if we are in this forum

I read in this thread that the videos are not in canisters but on cloudfare. Is that true and if it is true then what were the spikes in cycle consumption (20B+ cycles per second) that lasted for days and that were attributed to hotornot? I thought they came from video uploading. But maybe not. So what exactly caused them?

So, actual number of votes placed:

```
4.5 * 1.25 = 5.3 Million+ votes placed
```
[/quote]

Why is the total number of votes placed an estimate? Votes are surely placed on canisters, even if the videos aren’t there, so the canister must know exactly how many votes were placed. Does the canister not export such statistics?

Monetization - Where is the money coming from?
According to their FAQ, the money will be coming from consuming users directly:

> The current app is the alpha version which does not contain the Hot or Not monetization system. This will be added to the platform in the coming months, in accordance with GoBazzinga’s Dfinity grant milestones. The platform will contain an in-app game called “Hot or Not”. Users can stake their COYN tokens on any video, on either “Hot” or “Not” outcomes, depending on their thoughts on the viral capacity of the video. If the user stakes their token on the side of the majority, they win and earn double their tokens back. If the user stakes their tokens on the minority side, they lose all the tokens staked on that particular video. Hot or Not also monetises content creation without relying on advertisers, by giving 10% of all tokens staked to the creator of the video, regardless of the outcome.

I see a lot of ‘staking’ terminology being thrown around in the blockchain space, but I rarely see it being used in a sustainable way, except at protocol levels. This is literally just betting money on videos, where the content creator will get a cut. Even if we ignore any bad effects of young people betting money on videos they think will go viral, I am not aware of anyone wanting to do that.

When you go onto the app you get a little bit of tokens for free so there is no friction and a new user can start betting. Where are those tokens coming from? My guess is there is inflation/user onboarding costs to grow the application. This is not a sustainable model and would devalue any tokens you bought or invested in. Is that going to change? What happens when tokens are given to users that just log in once and arent spending them?

My biggest problem with this model is I dont see where the value is coming from. The only use for the tokens is to bet on the virality of videos. So that means it relies purely on user demand to define what the value of the tokens are and it assumes that people want to BUY them. As far as I can tell, no one has to buy any to use the service, just if they want to bet and have blown through the initial tokens that were gifted. How many people are demanding to bet on videos with real money? Even if the site was popular and there was good content, are people going make their income by scrolling through videos and betting money if its going to go viral? Maybe, but that is a very untested theory.

Hey there! Thank you all for your questions. As one of the co-founders and a long-standing member of the ICP ecosystem, I want to express our gratitude for the time you've taken to understand the HotOrNot App and its value proposition.

Also, as you have covered various aspects of our business, we are eager to share our thoughts on each of them comprehensively. We acknowledge that presenting this information in a thorough manner might take some time, and we kindly request your patience as we delve into each question.

We assure you that with all the information provided, you will gain a profound understanding and appreciation for the extensive time and effort invested in conceptualizing and implementing every facet of the Hot or Not platform. We believe in transparency and want to ensure that you receive a complete and detailed picture of our vision and execution.

Also, we acknowledge that our extensive white paper might be challenging to grasp fully in a short period. To make it easier for everyone to access key pieces of information, we will share essential insights right here in this forum. By doing so, we hope to make our vision and plans more accessible to a broader audience.

For the Monetisation part, would request you to please refer the information below:

The entire economy on Hot or Not is powered by 2 different tokens:

1. COYN is the in-game token that powers all transactions within the Hot or Not platform. Users are rewarded COYNs for their efforts within the ecosystem, including creating content, winning games, and referring others. Users spend COYNs to participate in various activities, such as voting, and leveling up. The circulating supply of COYNs is managed by various earning and burning mechanisms in order to keep pace with demand while maintaining inflationary pressure on the token. The various minting and burning mechanisms and their parameters would be decided and altered by the Hot or Not DAO Members using proposals.
2. HOT is the governance token in the Hot or Not ecosystem and is utilized for participation in all decision-making on the platform.

Starting out with COYN token first:

For COYN tokens, the underlying mechanism involves various gaming elements through which users can earn or lose COYN tokens. It begins with the simple HotOrNot Game and expands to other forms of gaming like

1. Hot or Not Game
2. Peer-to-Peer Competitions
3. Game on Short-Video Challenges
4. Creator Fantasy League
5. Creator Cards
6. Creator Exchange

Also it is very important to note that **100%** supply of **COYN**s is always locked on the Hot or Not DAO treasury until a user chooses to participate in a Level based game called **PHONE NFT**.

**The PHONE NFT game!**

Let's delve into the Phone NFTs game, a significant burning mechanism for COYN tokens.

Users need to participate in this NFT-based game to unlock and withdraw their COYN tokens through a DEX/CEX.

The Phone NFT game has 30 levels, with the Level 1 NFTs initially limited to just 20% of all users and Level 30 Phone NFTs only limited to 0.001% of all users on the Hot or Not Dapp.

Short Note:

Level 1 Phone NFT: 20% of all Users

Level 30 Phone NFT: 0.001% of all Users

As a user progresses through the levels, a higher percentage of their wallet balance becomes available for daily withdrawals from the ecosystem. This percentage increases from 1% per day at Level 2 to 50% per day at Level 30.

Short Note:

Level 1 PHONE NFT: 1% COYNs Unlocked Daily

Level 30 PHONE NFT: 50% of COYNs Unlocked Daily

In summary, as users progress through the levels, they can access a higher percentage of their wallet balance for daily withdrawals.

Also it is important to note, there are only two ways to get COYN tokens:

1. Spend more time on the Hot or Not App & participate in various games to earn COYNs
2. Buy it from a DEX/CEX (Post Listing)

Please note: The above pattern is inspired by popular web2 games, wherein users can advance by either dedicating more time to gameplay or purchasing specific in-game items using real-world currency. These items, such as skins and tools, are essential for progressing further in the game.

Let’s cover different formats of Games Proposed now:

1. **THE HOT OR NOT GAME**

2. Peer-to-Peer Competitions

3. **Game on Short-Video Challenges**

6. **Creator Exchange**

![Creator Exchange|679x269](upload://bU6yb6G6Czbquy1fZtbNdvvwjtq.png)

**Gamification Aspects and Token Dynamics:**

The gamification aspects mentioned above provide several avenues to earn COYN tokens through various voting mechanisms in different games. Users can participate in these games and voting processes to either earn or lose COYN tokens. Currently, all players are engaged with the Hot or Not ecosystem, where the platform's canisters create new tokens as rewards for winning voting games or burn tokens when a user loses in these games.

As the ecosystem evolves, we anticipate that most of these games will transition to a peer-to-peer model, facilitating the direct transfer of COYN token value between users. During these transactions, a portion of the COYN tokens involved will be directed to the Hot or Not DAO COYN treasury, enabling the community to benefit collectively from the platform's activities.

The entire creation and burning dynamics of COYN tokens will be managed by the Hot or Not SNS DAO. Through community proposals and decisions, the supply of COYN tokens can be adjusted, ensuring a balanced and sustainable token economy for the HotOrNot App ecosystem.

**Unlocking COYN Tokens through PHONE NFTs:**

Now comes the intriguing part for COYN tokens – once users have earned COYN tokens by participating in various games, they will need to engage in the NFT-based Phone NFT game to unlock and withdraw their COYN tokens.

**PHONE NFT Game Levels (Level 1 to Level 30):** The PHONE NFT game has been thoughtfully structured with different levels, starting from Level 1 and progressing up to Level 30.

**Dissolve Delay Functionality:** Think of Phone NFTs as similar to the Dissolve Delay feature in the NNS. As users reach higher PHONE NFT levels by spending COYN tokens (earned through participation or bought from a CEX or DEX), the Dissolve Delay decreases, enabling users to unlock their COYN tokens and cash out through an exchange.

**Unlocking COYN Tokens:** The proposed setup indicates that only 20% of COYN token holders will have the ability to cash out their tokens outright. The remaining 80% will need to either earn or purchase at least a Level 1 NFT to unlock their COYN tokens, which creates substantial demand for COYN tokens.

**Fluctuating NFT Prices:** Since Level 1 NFTs will be limited to just 20% of the user base, their prices will fluctuate based on market demand. As the supply of Level NFTs is limited, the value of all Phone NFTs will increase, presenting users with a unique opportunity to acquire them.

**Unlocking Mechanism Options:** Users can choose between two paths to participate in the Phone NFT game:

* Spend more time on the Hot or Not Dapp, earning more COYN tokens to purchase a Level 1 NFT.
* Buy COYN tokens from DEXs or CEXs to participate in the game and eventually cash out their COYN tokens.

**Burning Mechanism for Higher Levels:** Purchasing higher-level NFTs results in a net burning of COYN tokens. Users cannot hold multiple NFTs at different levels simultaneously. Buying a higher-level NFT necessitates burning a lower-level NFT, thereby reducing the circulating supply of COYN tokens.

**Rarity and Value of Higher-Level NFTs:** Higher-level NFTs, especially Level 30 Phone NFTs, will be exceedingly rare, catering to only 0.001% of all users on the platform. The scarcity of these NFTs will significantly increase their value, and their prices will be influenced by market demand.

**Unlocking the True Value of COYN Tokens:**

These innovative dynamics present users with an exciting opportunity to unlock the true value of their COYN tokens through engaging gameplay and the acquisition of rare NFTs, thus enriching the Hot or Not ecosystem.

**Community Involvement and Flexibility:** It's important to emphasize that the rules governing the Phone NFTs game will remain open to discussion and subject to the valuable input and feedback of the community. The Hot or Not ecosystem's flexibility allows for adaptability to change based on community feedback. The active participation of the community is highly valued, as they play a key role in shaping the future of the Phone NFT ecosystem.

**Sending COYN and HOT Tokens:** As part of the platform's design, it is proposed that sending COYN tokens from one user account to another will not be possible. Instead, the platform will only allow for HOT tokens to be sent between different accounts.

The combination of engaging gameplay, the allure of rare NFTs, and the community's active involvement ensures a dynamic and thriving ecosystem for Hot or Not users. Through these exciting features, the platform sets the stage for a transformative and interactive experience, unlocking the full potential of COYN tokens and solidifying Hot or Not as a trailblazer in the world of decentralized applications.

Further, more information on Creation & Burning of both COYN & HOT tokens is also listed below:

![The circulating supply can ba managed by three majoe factors|375x500](upload://mzA6S9KDWUi6t8JXXtWpbE8SIdK.png)

**Now presenting the HOT tokens utility:**

Now, let's delve into the exciting mechanisms for burning and earning HOT tokens in the future. Several proposals are being considered to boost demand for HOT, and they will primarily be driven by the following avenues:

* **Advertisements**: Hot tokens will be utilized in advertising campaigns, creating a demand for them as businesses and advertisers leverage the token for promotional activities.

* **Creation Fee for Creator DAOs**: Aspiring creators will need to pay a creation fee in HOT tokens to establish their presence within Creator DAOs, driving demand for HOT.

* **NFTs for Video Tools**: The platform plans to convert various video tools, such as filters, editing tools, and short video functionalities, into NFTs. This move empowers developers to earn royalties from their intellectual properties, leading to increased demand for HOT tokens.

* **Subscription of Creators/Premium Features/Early Access**: Users can access exclusive content, premium features, and early access to various services by subscribing with HOT tokens, thus driving demand for the token.

It is essential to note that apart from these avenues, there are several other mechanisms in the pipeline to enhance the utility of HOT tokens, including integration with other Dapps within the ICP ecosystem. For comprehensive details, I encourage you to refer to the White Paper.

Pleas find more information below:

![Token Supply Metrics of HOT|365x500](upload://ahWvAGGUuxGuMTTT9yNq8mQ40B0.png)

In Summary:

We firmly believe that with dedicated and thorough study of the white paper, anyone can grasp the sources of demand and supply for COYN & HOT tokens. We have invested considerable time and effort in crafting a diverse range of gamification elements that have the potential to revolutionize the landscape of social media.

The demand for COYN tokens is expected to be initially driven by the need to participate in the game and the potential to cash out COYN tokens, acting as the primary demand catalyst. This could attract a substantial user base, potentially reaching millions within the Hot or Not ecosystem. As the platform matures, other aspects of the business, such as pay-to-watch advertisements and various forms of NFTs, will emerge as significant demand drivers for both Hot and COYN tokens.

While we acknowledge that achieving these milestones won't happen overnight and may take years to fully materialize, we firmly believe in the transformative power of creating an entirely new industry that converges three rapidly expanding sectors: Web3, social media, and gamification. The integration of these domains, which has not been witnessed in the web2 social world, presents an extraordinary opportunity to pave the way for groundbreaking innovations.

The Hot or Not project dares to challenge the status quo and forge a path into uncharted territory. Our team is committed to pushing the boundaries and striving to create an ecosystem that captivates users and reshapes the future of web3, social media and entertainment.

Thanks for the detailed reply @rishichadha30 
I think I may have oversimplified the potential of the usage of the tokens but most of my concerns still apply such as the alogoritms, moderation, copyright, network effects, and problems that all apps can face when trying to get users and being able to scale with those users. I see a lot of gamified aspects around these tokens but none that really bring value or solving a problem that is needed in the space.

Do you see this sale as an early funding mechanism for further development? Its titled a 'decentralization sale' and the messaging I have seen around Hot or Not is that its already very popular and is a useful application, not an early-stage application which needs investment by the community to become useful. 

I really appreciate the response and I sounds like on a dev and technical level you guys are important to the industry. Im sure work you do it paving a path for other people to follow. I am so critical because I see MILLIONS of dollars being asked for and with that should come due diligence and when the sale is titled `A decentralized short-video social media platform governed by the people for the people`, I feel like that should be accurate, but it does not seem to be. You can one day be a decentralized platform, that would be great, but right now you are not and you are selling it like it is. If this was marketed as `Need funding so that one day we can be decentralized and have a people owned service using tokenomics to align incentives`, I would be ok, but I think people are buying this expecting it to be this way already.

Moderation/Copyright
There seems to be ZERO moderation on this application. From my experience MORE than HALF of the videos are just women in very little clothing and posing in very provocative manners. Not only that but the users who are posting them seem to just be posting random clickbait they have found vs the content they have created. Either that or the users have a lot of friends they take videos of that are viral in nature. Besides it being a bunch of sexual clickbait/spam, what about copyright. Who owns these videos? Who is taking them down or handling the situation where the rightful owner is not getting compensated? Is this also going to turn into where I can split up a movie into 100 clips and make money off of them just because I uploaded them? Sites like tiktok cant even handle this, its a hard problem, so why would this app be able to.
[/quote]

For Moderation:

As mentioned in our previous communication, we would be happy to provide you with comprehensive insights into each of the aspects you raised. We recognize that presenting this information thoroughly will require some time, and we sincerely request your patience as we delve into the details.

Also, we kindly urge all community members to revisit the white paper carefully. The forum questions have been extensively addressed in the white paper, which has been live for over a couple of months. Unfortunately, there seems to be some misinformation circulating, mainly due to a few individuals sharing inaccurate information on other socials.

Regarding the gamification aspect on social media, we understand that it might not resonate with all segments of current users. However, for certain segments, gaming on social media represents an entirely new and engaging experience that they would be eager to explore.

In response to the challenges of content moderation, as you pointed out in the forum post, even web2 companies struggle with it. We understand that companies like TikTok, Instagram, and other big tech giants employ thousands, and in some cases, millions of individuals annually to review content and make decisions about its appropriateness on the platform. We believe that, with the right token incentive mechanisms in place, many users could become moderators themselves, thereby creating a micro economy within the Hot or Not ecosystem. Users could dedicate their free time to moderation and earn token rewards for their efforts.

While we acknowledge that our current moderation efforts might not match the standards of established web2 social platforms, we assure you that we are diligently working on improving every aspect of our business.

To address content moderation effectively, we are adopting a layered approach with two main components:

* AI-based Text Sentiment & Video Analysis: This initial layer employs artificial intelligence to scan video and text content for explicit material, providing a first line of defense against inappropriate content. 
* User-Driven Proof-of-Stake Content Moderation: The second layer involves user-driven content moderation, which serves as a reporting mechanism for inappropriate content on the platform. This approach ensures that content goes through human review before being approved and posted on the global feed. 

In addition to the moderation strategy, we are also considering implementing three different types of Feeds to cater to various user preferences:

*    Parental Control & Safe for Family Feed
*    18+ Feed: No Nudity
*    SIN BIN: Explicit Content Allowed

All videos uploaded to the platform, after AI analysis, will initially enter the moderation feed. Moderators will earn token rewards for placing videos in the appropriate feed, and they will need to stake tokens to initiate and perform their moderation duties. Based on substantial votes from moderators within a certain time interval, videos will flow into the respective feeds.

We also plan to have a "SIN BIN" feed where explicit content can be accessed only with explicit user consent. This ensures that the community can decide which content should be kept away from general viewing.

To foster community involvement, we intend to offer bounties to community members who come up with innovative moderation ideas. We strongly believe that moderation should be a collaborative effort driven by the community, rather than being determined by a select few individuals.

After the SNS, we will open discussion forums to explore any further improvements or changes, and all decisions will be made through community-driven SNS proposals.

For more detailed information, please refer to our white paper or the provided screenshots below.

This keeps getting lost :frowning: 

"I am curious about the status of the name Hot or Not. It seems like a likely vector for future issues as a website with that name is well known, and is likely trademarked. Has the forming team looked into this or answered about this somewhere?"

*Not sure if this is relevant to the immediate swap but more for the future of the project.
It would not help if the sale ended and it immediately got into legal issues.. so maybe another name change near term 😉
