Hey 👋

Inspired from what [Distrik](https://az5sd-cqaaa-aaaae-aaarq-cai.ic0.app/) displays on their launch screen (kudos to them), I published an accessible custom element that summarizes what is Internet Identity. It can be integrated in any web apps.

```
npm install @papyrs/what-is-internet-identity
```

Repo & short readme 👉 https://github.com/papyrs/what-is-internet-identity

Hope it can be helpful.

Interestingly enough, you don't really need a security key or a Ledger. You can simply use Windows Hello with a Windows Hello Pin, which every time you authenticate, it'll prompt you to enter your Windows Hello Pin, all without the need of an additional physical key/ledger. 

Made a neat script that allows me to log into the NNS without having to touch my PC given there's so many steps to do it manually compared to Web2.
