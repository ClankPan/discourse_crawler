While waiting for official support in Q2, I shared a blog post on how to automatically generate Candid declaration types from Rust.

https://6zvwc-sqaaa-aaaal-aalma-cai.raw.icp0.io/d/automatically-generate-candid-from-rust-on-the-ic

It consolidates information from two forum threads (this [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/automatically-generate-candid-from-rust-sources) and this [other](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/generate-did-file-automatically)) ðŸ¤™

Above post is outdated, here the most recent solution:

Is this still the most recent solution?

It would merit a new blog post because the last article only described the migration, but, yes, the "New solution" is, to my knowledge, still "the" solution.
