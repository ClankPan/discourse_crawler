# Project Highlights
 Bridge 23 is a fully featured Data Marketplace running on an Internet Computer blockchain where everyone can sell their data directly to merchants, companies, and institutions.**

# Web3 Advantages
 Unlike traditional Web2 data brokerage models where consumersâ€™ data is harvested and sold without their consent, Bridge23 leverages Web3 principles to give control back to the users. Similar to how OpenChat offers a decentralized alternative to WhatsApp, Bridge23 offers a transparent and user-centric approach to data monetization. Users have full control over their data, deciding what to share and with whom, and are compensated fairly for their contributions. This contrasts sharply with Web2 models where users often have no say in how their data is used.
# How Itâ€™s Built
 We use multiple canisters for real-time exchange rates, receipts OCR and recognition, cross-chain NFT minting and authentication in the EVM chain, and index canisters for fetching user account data.  


* Internet computer 
* React.js
* Juno
* Telegram

### Canisters:

* [Candid UI Exchange rate canister](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=5zigg-xyaaa-aaaak-aktyq-cai)

* [Candid U Mint on the Base canister](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=tkuag-tqaaa-aaaak-akvgq-ca)

* [Frontend canister]( [https://n5isd-iaaaa-aaaal-adtra-cai.icp0.io/](https://n5isd-iaaaa-aaaal-adtra-cai.icp0.io/login))

* [Candid UI Receipts recognize canister](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=kbtje-zyaaa-aaaak-qiija-cai/)
 ## Design Decisions:
* Data Security: Implementing advanced encryption methods to ensure data privacy.
* User Experience: Using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for seamless styling and responsive design.
* Scalability: Leveraging ICPâ€™s decentralized infrastructure for scalable and efficient data handling.

# Internet Computer Superpowers
 On the Internet Computer, we make it real to own and monetize high-value user data. In the future UTOPIA will help fix GDPR and any privacy policy for users' data stored and sold. We can write much more but the Internet Computer Blockchain is our app superpower.

# Go-To-Market Strategy
To attract users, Bridge23 will leverage a multi-faceted go-to-market strategy:
* Promotion on Job search platforms: after user interviews we know how many enthusiasts monetize data, look for work, or want to change work. Users becoming a data seller on our platform can create for early adopters economic opportunity and motivation to help us build data sets on starts.
* Partnerships: Collaborating with merchants and marketing agencies to onboard initial users and validate our model.
* 0 fee for first sellers and buyers.
* Telegram integration for growing user base
* Build Gate23 POS for the second step of our ecosystem

# Monetization
 Bridge23 is designed for profit, with a focus on fair data transactions. Our primary revenue streams include transaction fees on data sales, premium features for merchants, and potentially a marketplace for data-driven insights. Launching an SNS (Service Nervous System) and decentralizing governance is part of our long-term strategy to ensure that the community has a say in the platformâ€™s evolution and to foster a sustainable ecosystem.

# Status of the Project
 Bridge23 is currently in the MVP testing stage. We have successfully validated PMF from the business side and user side for the next hypothesis test. Waitlist 5.000+, more than 150 user interviews, 20+ business interviews. Also, we finished our community Grant milestones and finally changed the product to a Data marketplace, when we submit a grant we use it as an expense tracker.

# Future Plans
Our plans include:
* Feature Expansion: Adding more data categories like social media activity and browser history.
* Separate Canister: Create architecture for separate user canisters after setting up the seller account.
* Integrate ICP ecosystem projects
* Expansion to telegram ecosystem: seamless integration telegram to ICP ecosystem
* Conferences and Grants: Participating in blockchain conferences and applying for grants to fund further development.
* Enhanced Analytics: Developing advanced analytics tools for merchants to extract deeper insights from the data purchased.
* SNS DAO

I'm obviously a bit biased given the excellent choice of tech stack (:wink:), but after trying out the dApp, I must say I already enjoyed the in-app experience of your alpha version. :+1:

Good luck with the project! ðŸ¤ž

I think it is time for this forum platform to be built on ICP Blockhane, via Fleek. I think the data generated through this forum will contribute, at least a little, to the ICP data stack.
