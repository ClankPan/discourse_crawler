Hello everyone. I apologize right away, I’m writing through a translator.
![Opera Снимок_2023-12-15_112203_identity.ic0.app|690x386](upload://uNJzB1mYoYlKzQ012QBNcNlu3J0.png)
I had this problem today. When I linked a new device (phone), a code was displayed from the main device, but I couldn’t enter it on the phone; when I pressed the update button, it gave an error. And on the main device (laptop) the following message appeared: “ Unknown Internet Identity

Failed to find Internet Identity 1424316. Please check your Internet Identity and try again".
Before this, I logged into my wallet without problems using this ID.

Hi @antydot 

Could you please tell us the make and model of the device you were using (including browser versions).

Could you also please clarify what you mean by:
> but I couldn’t enter it on the phone

Also, you seem to only have a recovery phrase attached to that identity number. Please use the recovery flow to add a new Passkey:
1. got to https://identity.ic0.app
2. More options / Use existing
3. Lost access
4. Use recovery phrase

Please let me know if you need more assistance. Thanks!

Hello, I used an old Acer 4930 laptop to log in and wanted to give permission to my Infinix Note 30 phone. Chrome browser((Version 120.0.6099.110 (Official build), (64 bit)). I didn’t have a recovery phrase, I used the ledger hardware wallet key to log in. With this action, the operation froze a little.
I think I understand what the problem is. I removed an old phone that was no longer working from the allowed devices, and I think when the system froze, the permission for the laptop was removed.Now more than one device is not attached to this identifier.
Thanks for the help, I don’t think there’s anything I can do here.
