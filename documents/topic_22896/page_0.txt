In the forum post [HERE](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-fund-revised-design-proposal/14691), it says

> "Using a tick-box in the NNS FE dapp, a neuron can join and leave the CF at any time, also during a voting period."

Is that the current functionality?

If SNS proposal "A" says they want 80% of their funding to come from the neuron fund, and you don't like that, all you have to do is uncheck the box in the NNS until their proposal is passed/rejected? Then if SNS proposal "B" says they want 10% of their funding to come from the neuron fund, and you like that, you can just check the box in the NNS and you will help fund it?

Theoretically if every neuron unchecked the box today, the neuron fund would be zero? Or are those funds locked into it in some way?

Any clarification would be appreciated. Thanks!

Anyone? 

There HAS to be someone who can verify this is the current functionality. Or does no one know and that's why people have such strong reactions to high percentage SNS neuron fund requests?

Yes, this is how the fund currently works.

[Here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Neurons_Fund#.282.29_Voting_on_investments) is a bit more info as to how joining/leaving the Neuron's Fund during voting affects the swap:

> * If NF neurons opt out of the NF whilst an SNS proposal is open for voting, then the ICP amount the NF was proposed to make is reduced proportionally.
> * If neurons opt in when an SNS proposal is open for voting, the ICP amount the NF invests in an SNS remains the same, but each NF neuron will participate with less maturity (proportionally decreased).
