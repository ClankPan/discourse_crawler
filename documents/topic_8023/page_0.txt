Using `ignore` does not affect the way a message is sent, it merely throws away the result (more generally, `ignore` is independent from message sends, it just throws away *a* value).

In principle, message sends can always fail, e.g., because the canister is down. However, if you await the result of the message then you'll be notified with an exception locally, whereas without `await` you won't get an exception.

So, `await` is what's relevant wrt detecting failure, not `ignore`. For example:
```motoko
let x = await foo.bar();  // raises exception if message fails
let y = foo.bar();        // does not raise exception, unless you await y later
ignore foo.bar();         // does not raise exception
ignore await foo.bar();   // raises exception, otherwise ignores result
```

It may help to know that `ignore` effectively is just a shorthand for `let _ =`.
