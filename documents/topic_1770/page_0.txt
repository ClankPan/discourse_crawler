Continuing the discussion from [Frontend hosted elsewhere](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/frontend-hosted-elsewhere/1369/7):

i used 
var buffer = Buffer.from("Amr", 'utf8');
and replace it insted of this "CANDID_ENCODED_ARGUMENT_GOES_HERE"
I didnt know what encoded or hash method I can use for candid in react
