The DFINITY NNS Team has submitted a proposal to upgrade the CMC Canister on Friday, 2023-05-12.

## Hotfix

This hotfix fixes a bug introduced in the last CMC upgrade. Before the last upgrade of the Cycles-Minting Canister, an exchange rate proposal was required to update the ICP/XDR rate as well as the 30-day average ICP/XDR rate (accessible through the endpoints `get_icp_xdr_conversion_rate` and `get_average_icp_xdr_conversion_rate`, respectively).

After the upgrade, the CMC started requesting the ICP/XDR rate periodically from the [exchange rate canister](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543). While the ICP/XDR rate has been updated successfully using this new mechanism ever since the upgrade, a bug prevented an update of the average ICP/XDR rate. The fix is simple: The code to update the average ICP/XDR rate is now called whenever a new, valid ICP/XDR rate is received, regardless of the source of the rate.

What is the impact of this bug? The average ICP/XDR rate is used to determine [node provider remuneration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) and [maturity modulation](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Maturity_modulation). Since only the rates for three days (May 9 - May 11) are not considered in the 30-day average rate, a back-of-the-envelope calculation (using the start-of-day rates on these days) reveals that the reported 30-day average ICP/XDR rate is, in fact, slightly too high, with a relative error of less than 1%, so the impact on node provider remuneration and maturity modulation is small.
