I saw [https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/exchange_rate](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/exchange_rate), but it's a big overkill.

I just want a humble function or small boilerplate to add a humble HTTP outcall to my existing main.mo / project without adding a ton of extra stuff.

Is there simple boilerplate code to add HTTP outcalls to a project?
