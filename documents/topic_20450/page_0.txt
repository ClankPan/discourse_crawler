One of the reasons I believe that apps that use blockchain do not get much popularity with the general public is that devs usually put the tech and blockchain ahead of the real customer needs, going all in on chain difficulties, creating a big entry barrier all because it is cool, decentralized, or censorship resistant,but most of the time these things do not matter for their product or customer.

Suposing I want to build a podcast app that is 100% legal and compliant with the law, with a value proposition to share a fair profit with creators. Why not build mainly using traditional Web2 on the cloud and use the chain only to solve the problems that crypto and the chain are good at, like transactions, commissions, Daos, etc.?

Don't get me wrong here, but I see a lot of criticism from the blockchain community (in general)  defending everything on the chain. But why not mix? This mixed approach would leverage a much better user experience in the applications and, with time, educate people about the chain.

I would agree that a lot of what we see these days with dapps is very web2 like and adopt blockchain to stand out or offer a small difference from the web2 experience. One issue is the lack of infrastructure, lack of applications and lack of protocols, but it will get there.
Blockchain makes it so that by default, everything is open and accessible with money built right into the APIs. This means that (unless restricted by the owner) all APIs can just be accessed and use your web3 identity/tokens, no account needed. 

What that unlocks:

- Composability - Now I can make a very good feature (X) that everyone can use. I dont have to build an entire platform or an ecosystem, I can just make that good feature and who ever wants it can use it. Also that means that anyone can build on top of X to make X even more useful. Split up the work and use what is best (fingers crossed for this utopia)

- Networked apps via Protocols - Before I got info the IC I was fascinated with the Fediverse/ActivityPub. The idea that there is one protocol, but many independent servers to get similar results as Web2. The IC can be like the fediverse where there are many services that speak the same language. I personally dont think there is going to be a 'killer dapp' at least not for a while. It wont be because the dapp is something that no one thought about, but rather there will be enough applications to network and integrate with one another making a useful network with protocols. That being said, if the protocol route is where a killer dapp will come from, then it will be more like 'killer dapps' because anyone can make an app on that protocol and compete. 

Bit of a ramble. hopefully some of that made sense

The discussion surrounding DApps/Web3 versus traditional Web2 combined with blockchain development often centers on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, emphasizing that the choice depends heavily on the specific use case and requirements. Let's delve into the key points of comparison:

1. **Decentralization and Trustlessness**:
  * DApps/Web3: Decentralized applications (DApps) built on Web3 infrastructure aim to eliminate the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain development technology. They prioritize decentralization and trustlessness, ensuring that transactions and data are validated and stored across a distributed network of nodes.
  * Traditional Web2 with Blockchain: Integrating blockchain development into traditional Web2 applications can enhance transparency and security but may not achieve the same level of decentralization and trustlessness as DApps/Web3. Centralized components may still exist, potentially introducing points of failure or vulnerability.
2. **Security and Immutability**:
  * DApps/Web3: DApps inherently benefit from the security and immutability provided by blockchain technology. Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it is tamper-resistant and verifiable, reducing the risk of fraud or data manipulation.
  * Traditional Web2 with Blockchain: Integrating blockchain into traditional Web2 applications can improve security by providing cryptographic verification and immutability for certain data transactions. However, vulnerabilities in centralized components may still pose risks.
3. **Scalability and Performance**:
  * DApps/Web3: Scalability remains a challenge for many DApp development platforms due to the consensus mechanisms and limitations of existing blockchain infrastructures. High transaction fees and slower transaction speeds can impact user experience.
  * Traditional Web2 with Blockchain: By combining blockchain with traditional Web2 infrastructure, developers may have more flexibility to optimize scalability and performance. Off-chain solutions and layer 2 protocols can help mitigate scalability challenges while leveraging the security benefits of blockchain.
4. **User Experience and Adoption**:
  * DApps/Web3: User experience can vary widely across DApps/Web3 platforms, with factors such as wallet integration, transaction friction, and onboarding processes influencing adoption. Education and awareness efforts are crucial for mainstream adoption.
  * Traditional Web2 with Blockchain: Integrating blockchain into familiar Web2 applications may offer a smoother user experience and lower barriers to adoption, particularly for users unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. Gradual introduction of blockchain features can help users transition seamlessly.
5. **Regulatory Compliance and Governance**:
  * DApps/Web3: Regulatory compliance and governance frameworks for DApps/Web3 applications are still evolving, presenting challenges for developers and users alike. Compliance with existing regulations, such as KYC/AML requirements, can be complex.
  * Traditional Web2 with Blockchain: Leveraging traditional Web2 infrastructure alongside blockchain may simplify regulatory compliance by incorporating existing frameworks and governance structures. However, compliance with blockchain-specific regulations and standards may still be necessary.

In conclusion, while DApps/Web3 offer unparalleled decentralization and security benefits, integrating blockchain into traditional Web2 applications can provide a pragmatic approach for certain use cases, balancing decentralization with scalability and user experience. Ultimately, the choice between DApps/Web3 and traditional Web2 with blockchain app development services on the specific requirements, regulatory considerations, and long-term objectives of the project.

Would be nice to get a cost comparison perspective.
