* FYI This is not a critique of II. Looking for background only and want to make the best decision on which spec to use. 

I have been thinking about identity mgt on our platform which prompted me to look through the II github repo. It‚Äôs a cool solution but it has its drawbacks so‚Ä¶.

I am wondering why Dfinity chose to use Webauthn instead of something else e.g. DID or some other W3C specification for II, could you please explain or point me to the info as I cannot find? üôè

II might predate dids, not entirely sure but also they are represent slightly different domains. Really, you need the power of something like II to leverage the power of dids, otherwise it could be a nightmare for a user to manage however many identity wallets they might need to verify their identity.
