## objective

proposal:reset followers of all neurons that did not vote on this proposal

Only keep the follow state of neurons that voted on this proposal

 For any neuron:
1. Whether it votes no or yes for this proposal, the neuron following state will be preserved
2. Whether manually voting or following other neurons to vote, the neuron's follow-up state will be preserved

## background

This proposal is an improved version of the reset all followers proposal to solve the problem of many people not being able to set up followers in a timely manner

## disadvantage

I don't know if it's technically possible
