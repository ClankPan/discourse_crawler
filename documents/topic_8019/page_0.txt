You may need to update the version in your projectâ€™s dfx.json to 0.8.3. You can also try running `dfx cache install` to unpack the newer version.

Also, `dfx cache list` will show a list of your local versions along with an asterisk by the currently used one.

If this still fails you could try reinstalling:
`DFX_VERSION=0.8.3 sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"`

every dfx command I try is giving me the same error. I tried running the command: `DFX_VERSION=0.8.3 sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"`. 

Still getting the same errors

I think your 'dfx' key in dfx.json is '0.8.0' and it needs to be 0.8.1 and 0.8.3. Just update the key to the respective versions.
