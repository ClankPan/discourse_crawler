Hello everyone,

following the creation of the [ICRC Github repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/issues), we're excited to announce a ICRC catch-all working group to discuss community ICRC proposals that have not yet been attributed to any topic-specific working groups.

**Topic: Catch-all (pending issues and sorting)**
DFINITY lead: @benji
Coordinator: TBD
Cadence: Bi-weekly Wednesdays at 6 pm CEST (GMT+2)
First meeting: May 23rd, 2023

ICRC encourages all members of the community to contribute by proposing reasonably formulated proposals. You can simply open an issue or PR in the ICRC Github, as long as you believe the proposal is at least generic enough for a specific sector. If you're unsure you're also welcome to come to the catch-all working group meeting to discuss your ideas first with the group.
