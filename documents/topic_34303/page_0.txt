I want to do an IDO of a meme token I made in motoko.

I know that the most popular DEXs are ICL, Sonic and ICPswap. However, [the icpswap launchpad](https://iloveics.gitbook.io/icpswap/products/launchpad) has no input for a principal for my token canister. Am I missing something?

If not, what is a good place to release a token / make public on DEXs ?

You can request to get indexed on the most popular DEXes. I believe that ICPSwap Launchpad is only for tokens created through the launchpad itself - Can you please confirm @ICPSwap?

Thanks Jennifer for the tag.

Hello Jaime!

The Launchpad feature on ICPSwap isn't officially available yet, so it's not possible to conduct your token's IDO through it. However, some project teams have used ICPSwap V3 by adding an amount of ICP along with their tokens to create liquidity and start trading. You might want to consider if this approach suits your needs.

Also, the Sonic team has an LBP feature that you could explore by contacting their team. 
And the IC Ghost team offers a fair launch feature - ICPI that you might be wanna check out.

Once your token is available and ready for trading, feel free to use this guide to add initial liquidity and start trading on ICPSwap: https://iloveics.gitbook.io/icpswap/products/swap-liquidity/how-to-create-a-new-liquidity-pool
