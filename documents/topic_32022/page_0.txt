**Hi everyone!**

We're excited to introduce **MAIA**, the **Medical AI Assistant on Internet Computer.**

* **Our Story**
    
  We started with a simple goal: to provide patients with valuable insights and ensure the accuracy of their diagnoses, offering a reliable **"second opinion."** But as we continued to develop, we realized that we could do so much more. 

    We envisioned a tool that could not only **help patients** but also **assist doctors** in making their diagnostic processes more **efficient** and **accurate**. This led us to start building **MAIA**.

* **What Can MAIA Do? [Summary of First Sprint]**

  * **Brain CT Scans:** Upload a **Brain CT Scan**, and **MAIA** can analyze it to detect **glioma**, **meningioma**, and **pituitary tumors** or confirm if the scan is **clear**.

  * **Kidney CT Scans:** Upload a **Kidney CT Scan**, and **MAIA** can identify **cysts**, **stones**, or **tumors**, or confirm if the scan is **normal**.
  * **Lung CT Scans:** Upload a **Lung CT Scan**, and **MAIA** can check for **adenocarcinoma**, **large cell carcinoma**, and **squamous cell carcinoma**, or verify if the **lungs are healthy**.
  * **Skin Lesion Images:** Upload an image of a **mole**, and **MAIA** can determine if itâ€™s **benign** or **malignant**, providing **quick** and **reliable** feedback.
  * **Chest X-Ray:** Upload a **Chest X-Ray**, and **MAIA** can diagnose **tuberculosis**, **coronavirus**, **bacterial pneumonia**, **viral pneumonia**, or confirm if the **lungs are healthy**.
  * **Provide Diagnosis Information:** Get detailed information about the diagnosis provided by **MAIA**.
  * **Answer Questions:** Ask questions about your diagnosis, and **MAIA** will provide informative answers.

* **Planned Features for the Next Sprint**

  * **Ultrasound Scan Diagnoses:** **MAIA** will assist in analyzing and classifying ultrasound scans to detect issues like **breast cancer** and **lymph node problems**.

  * **Comprehensive Skin Analysis:** Right now, **MAIA** can analyze **moles** to detect **benign** or **malignant growths.** We want MAIA to be able to analyze all **skin-related diseases** and **problems**.
  * **Bone Health Assessments:** Including the detection of **osteoporosis** and **bone fractures**.
  * **Blood Test Analysis:** **MAIA** will help interpret **blood test results** to diagnose various conditions.
  * **UI Updates:**  We want **MAIA** to have an easy-to-use interface for mobile users. Therefore, we will be making updates to improve the user experience.

* **Demo**

 Our journey with **MAIA** is just starting. We'll continue to share updates about **MAIA** here. 
  
  We are open to feedback and suggestions during these early stages, and we would love to hear your thoughts.

I like your idea for several reasons.  First is that it's not defi.  I think ICP needs to diversify in terms of the types of projects it has.  It's too defi focused although I understand that's where a lot of the money is at for crypto.

Another reason I like your project is because I can see Ai being integrated more into the medical field.  I read a study where it was determined that doctors were copy/pasting from ChatGPT in their articles for academic journals.  Surely, they wouldn't mind also using Ai to aid in diagnoses, as well.  In fact, some of them do rely on WebMD as a second opinion, but instead of Googling for the information themselves, an Ai project like yours, can sort of automate that process by retrieving the information for them.

I hope you introduce yourselves more, your background, and talk more on the need for this project, it's potential in the market, etc.  LFG @ICP.

Hi, nice work!
I'm curious on the tech side of things, are you storing the model on chain?

-------------------------

MAIA | 2024-06-20 19:05:20 UTC | #8

Hi! Yes, we are storing our diagnose models on chain.
Thank you for your interest!

All the best with the project!

Good project definitely helpful
Just curious what models are you using for diagnosis are they opensource ?
Are you planning to fine tune the models furthermore based on users data ?

-------------------------

MAIA | 2024-07-08 20:53:09 UTC | #11

Hi Txo, Thank you for your interest !

We are currently training our models from scratch. However, we are considering open-sourcing them in the future.
While our current plans do not include storing user data for fine-tuning purposes, we do intend to create a feedback system to identify models that need further fine-tuning and improvement.

You can review our detailed plans in the [grant application](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/maia-medical-ai-assistant/32922) we recently submitted. We look forward to your feedback!
