Hi!
I am sorry if as simple question, but I am migrating from relational databases thinking to ICP way :) 
My question is how to declare the below as a stable 
var myData = HashMap.HashMap<Principal, [DataModel]>(0, Principal.equal, Principal.hash);

`mo:base/HashMap` is not a stable data structure so you can't declare it with `stable var`. I suggest you use something like https://mops.one/stablehashmap instead
