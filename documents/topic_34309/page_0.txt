After adding a custom domain to my asset canister, I noticed that iframe-referenced configurations were not blocked by the appropriate headers, potentially posing security risks for users. How can I add the `X-Frame-Origin: DENY` header?

Hi @paul.l 

The boundary nodes automatically set this header on all API endpoints (`query`, `call`, `status`, `read_state`), but not on the HTTP endpoints (e.g., custom domains or `canister-id.icp0.io`). 

I am assuming that you are using an asset canister. In that case, you can configure your own headers through `.ic-assets.json`. I couldn't find the right docs (it's not my area of expertise, sorry), but found some remotely related docs that show how to do it: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/identity/internet-identity/alternative-origins#configuring-your-frontend-canister

I asked internally and once I get the right link, I will post it here.

Here's two links that should clarify `ic-assets.json`:

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/application-frontends/asset-security
https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/asset-canister

Basically the JSON file structure is an array at the root where each entry has a `match` string property with a glob pattern, `headers` property with a key/value list of headers and lastly optionally the `allow_raw_access`* boolean property to allow/block access on the raw sub domain.


\* Raw access propery is basically redundant functionality in case of the asset canister with the new gateway architecture.

Thank you very much, this will help me solve my problem.
