I want to create  a main canister which will deploy child canisters . The project is developed in azle(typescript) . The code for the child canisters has to be stored in the main canister what  is the best way to do this . The child canister is a ICRC-1 type canister so its quite large

@lastmjs is there a working solution to this yet?  I also want to create canisters dynamically in azle but haven't found an example.

Creating canisters with Azle is essentially the same as with Motoko or Rust, you use the Management Canister to create a canister and then install the Wasm binary into it: https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/blob/main/examples/management_canister/src/index.ts#L64
