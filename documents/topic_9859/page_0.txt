I'm building a tool called `recycle`, the goal is to help developers automatically reclaim cycles from unused canisters to their cycles wallet, but I got some problems in testing:

I'm trying to send cycles from an unused canister to my own cycles wallet, I reinstalled the following code to the canister, then called `recycle`, but got this error:
```
The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister gagfc-iqaaa-aaaah-qcdvq-cai trapped explicitly: could not perform remote call"
```

Code: 
```
import Nat "mo:base/Nat";
import Error "mo:base/Error";
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";
import Result "mo:base/Result";
import Cycles = "mo:base/ExperimentalCycles";
import ic "./ic"

shared(msg) actor class Recycle(owner_: Principal) = this {

    private stable var owner: Principal = owner_;
    private stable var IC: ic.ICActor = actor("aaaaa-aa");

    public type CyclesWallet = actor {
        wallet_receive: shared() -> async ();
    };

    public query func cycles(): async Nat {
        return Cycles.balance();
    };

    public shared(msg) func get_freezing_threshold(canister_id: Principal): async Nat {
        try {
            let status = await IC.canister_status({canister_id = canister_id});
            switch(status.settings.freezing_threshold) {
                case(?n) { return n; };
                case(_) { return 0; };
            };
        } catch (e) {
            return 2_592_000;
        };
    };

    public shared(msg) func recycle(to: Principal, leftover: Nat): async Bool {
        assert(msg.caller == owner);
        let bal = Cycles.balance();
        let amount: Nat = bal - leftover;

        let wallet: CyclesWallet = actor(Principal.toText(to));
        Cycles.add(amount);
        await wallet.wallet_receive();
        return true;
    };
}
```

BTW, another two questions:
1. how to get the actual `freezing_threshold` of a canister? I used `dfx canister --network ic status xxx`, the freezing threshold is 2_592_000, but when I try to send `ExperimentalCycles.balance() - 2_592_000` amount of cycles to my cycles wallet, I got this error telling me the freezing threshold is 122346093:
```
The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister gagfc-iqaaa-aaaah-qcdvq-cai is out of cycles: requested 3897751976035 cycles but the available balance is 3897751904703 cycles and the freezing threshold 122346093 cycles"
```
2. is there any better way to destroy the unused canister and get back as many cycles as I can to my cycles wallet? Or any suggestions on how to build such a tool?

Thanks, I'll take a look into it

`could not perform remote call`

Hi, Did you find the reason for the problem "Canister xxx trapped explicitly: could not perform remote call"
I have the same problem.
Thanks

Nope, still don't know the reason

There are some global variables in the canister, and when the request tries to access one of them, I got this error, and others are ok.

I've seen this error seemingly when a canister does not have enough cycles to complete an update call.
