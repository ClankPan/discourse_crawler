try to sort Array by using method Array.sort(),  but build met error as: 
<A>
type error [M0072], field sort does not exist in type

*module {
    append : <A>([A], [A]) -> [A];
    chain : <A, B>([A], A -> [B]) -> [B];
    equal : <A>([A], [A], (A, A) -> Bool) -> Bool;
    filter : <A>([A], A -> Bool) -> [A];
    find : <A>([A], A -> Bool) -> ?A;
    flatten : <A>([[A]]) -> [A];
    foldLeft : <A, B>([A], B, (B, A) -> B) -> B;
    foldRight : <A, B>([A], B, (A, B) -> B) -> B;
    freeze : <A>([var A]) -> [A];
    init : <A>(Nat, A) -> [var A];
    keys : <A>([A]) -> Iter<Nat>;
    make : <A>(A) -> [A];
    map : <A, B>([A], A -> B) -> [B];
    mapEntries : <A, B>([A], (A, Nat) -> B) -> [B];
    mapFilter : <A, B>([A], A -> ?B) -> [B];
    mapResult : <A, R, E>([A], A -> Result<R, E>) -> Result<[R], E>;
    tabulate : <A>(Nat, Nat -> A) -> [A];
    tabulateVar : <A>(Nat, Nat -> A) -> [var A];
    thaw : <A>([A]) -> [var A];
    vals : <A>([A]) -> Iter<A>:
  }* 
</A>

seems sort() is not a function for array, but it is mentioned in motoko library

as: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/array#sort

Crazy, I cam across this exact same thing a day ago... I ended up just copying the sort and sortInPlace functions from the motoko array lib on gibthub and it works for the time being.

That is... really odd. I created an issue, we'll investigate.

What is your dfx version? Until recently  (and perhaps still), dfx was shipping an outdated moc 0.6.1 and base library.

LOL that works. :laughing:
would u mind to paste the code here...

-------------------------

foolingdutchman | 2021-07-13 08:55:29 UTC | #6

my dfx version is 0.7.2

-------------------------

claudio | 2021-07-13 09:47:54 UTC | #7

0.7.2 was still shipping Motoko 0.6.1.

Either stick with your workaround or, if you are feeling brave, try dfx 0.7.6.

claudio | 2021-07-14 11:32:24 UTC | #8

Dfx 0.7.7 is now out, fixing issues with. 0.7.6.
