Hi everyone,

I cannot take credit for writing or preparing any of this material because I didn’t, but I am posting it on behalf of the ICP DAO LLC. Personally, I’m bullish and I hope this paper makes you feel this way too.

Keep building,
Seb

Dear ICP Community,

This is an announcement of the upcoming SNS DAO launch for the ICP Community Conference (”ICPCC”) DAO LLC, which will launch a native token called $CONF. This SNS proposal will be submitted to the NNS in 2 weeks on May 4th. The target start date for the SNS decentralization swap sale is May 9th, one day before the ICPCC event on May 10th.


# Summary

### Project:

* ICPCC DAO LLC is a community-owned and fully self-sustaining decentralized conference event series devoted to highlighting the ICP’s technology and ecosystem.
* The DAO will control 100% of the ICP raised during its SNS swap sale, use the treasury to hire vendors to organize its events, and then receive the income from event ticket sales and sponsorships back into its treasury.
* The ICPCC DAO will be a fully independent Marshall Islands Non-Profit DAO LLC, able to sign legal agreements and manage Intellectual Property via on-chain SNS proposals.
* The DAO will elect an “ICPCC Council” of 3-5 notable ICP ecosystem leaders to shape critical proposals for the DAO to vote on.

### Tokenomics:

* $CONF will be the native token required for tickets, VIP perks, and merch for future ICPCC events. It will also serve as the SNS governance token.
* 41% of the token supply will go towards SNS swap sale participants, a new record for SNS DAOs! Code & State will receive 4% according to the same vesting schedule as the SNS swap sale participants.
* 4% of the token supply will be airdropped to all SNS Swap sale participants who contributed the first 80,000 ICP raised as an “early bird” bonus.
* 4% of the token supply will be airdropped to ICPCC 2023 & 2024 attendees.
* After a successful SNS swap sale, Johann Hartman is expected to submit a Request Motion proposal asking ICPCC DAO LLC to add 23,600 $CONF from its treasury alongside a comparable amount of $ICP as liquidity to a DEX, based on the max contribution limit set during the SNS launch.

### How ICPCC DAO LLC is making history:

* It will become the 1st self-sustaining Web3 event series with a fully DAO-controlled treasury.
* It will be the 1st SNS DAO to be guided by a self-elected “ICPCC Council,” which will give it complete control over a leadership team it owns and manages.
* It will be the 1st off-chain SNS DAO. An “off-chain DAO” means it will operate as a real-world legal entity to manage off-chain activities. In this case, the DAO will manage its treasury to fund in-person and virtual events.

# Tokenomics Overview

Please see the above Litepaper for more in-depth information.

## Initial Token Supply
![image|690x370](upload://i6RyStRq5J5lgBFz7iuHY5r814G.png)


## Token Parameters

* **Ticker = $CONF**
* **Total Supply = 1,000,000 $CONF** - Fixed supply, no inflation.
* **Transfer Fee = 0.0001 $CONF**

## SNS Launch Parameters

* **Min ICP Raised = 1 ICP** - If a low amount of ICP is raised, the DAO can still fund events through collecting sponsorships under the established ICPCC brand. The primary purpose of this SNS sale is to decentralize the existing ICPCC event series under a DAO rather than fundraising. 
* **Max ICP Raised = 160,000 ICP**
* **Min Participation = 1 ICP**
* **Max Participation = 20,000 ICP**
* **Min Participants = 400**
* **Neuron Fund Participation** = No. 
* **Restricted Countries:**
  * **USA** - To reduce the risk of SEC scrutiny and start ICPCC DAO LLC in good faith following all industry best practices, Americans are restricted from participating in the sale.
  * **Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea, & Russia** - To comply with the Marshall Islands & United Nations sanctions regimes, residents of these countries are restricted from participating in the sale.

# ICPCC DAO LLC Manifesto

*We, the people of the ICP community, hereby establish the ICPCC DAO as a living experiment to create an immortal and autonomous public good. This act represents a critical step towards a new type of revolution, not one of industry but of governance, using the power of the Internet Computer Protocol. Let this DAO serve as an example and compass for inspiring a new generation of Web3 innovators who will help humanity construct a world that's more just, free, fair, accessible, and transparent. The purpose of the ICPCC DAO will be to highlight and forever celebrate the role ICP has in achieving this noble vision of Web3. May we collectively guide it with diligence, unity, pragmatism, and righteousness.*

[/quote]

that's a bit confusing.. in the Russia/Ukraine war the Ukraine is clearly not the aggressor. Though people from the Ukraine cannot participate? What puts the Ukraine in the list of mentioned countries and excludes Russia?

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-21 13:16:41 UTC | #4

Actually I'm pretty sure it's an error that Russia is not listed, I'll verify and address that when I get back on Monday.

There are some specific regions within Ukraine which are on the sanction lists (probably because of being under Russian control), but IP restrictions can only be applied to a full country at once. Unfortunately, that's why Ukraine has to be listed.

The restrictions are based on a section of the Operating Agreement.

kizzafredrichkibalam | 2024-04-21 13:47:35 UTC | #5

I'll like the whole concept of an Offchain sns DaO. Will reach out to u to know more

-------------------------

estebansuarez | 2024-04-22 18:26:23 UTC | #6

Awesome work @aiv & @Seb. Congrats again!

-------------------------

dao1 | 2024-04-22 18:38:42 UTC | #7

Liquidity, listing and market making. What are the plans

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-22 19:05:19 UTC | #9

@dao1 

Ultimately all of these items will be up to the DAO to execute once it's launched. But the plan is for the initial council member to submit proposals for getting the token listed and for adding substantial liquidity to be added to a DEX.

The liquidity plan is laid out in this section of the Litepaper:
https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#2b66a689c8a84655b429611e13c2179a

The launch process is outlined in this section of the Litepaper:
https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#981d8fd4e72446b18950d26a38c47942

-------------------------

dao1 | 2024-04-22 19:18:52 UTC | #10

Thank u for the answer. The concern is how to deal with so many tokens given to the sns? How does the market absorb the token emissions

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-22 19:56:13 UTC | #11

Well $CONF will have a fixed token supply so there are no emissions from newly minted tokens like with SNS DAOs that use the built-in reward mechanism.

A custom governance reward mechanism will need to be implemented, as explained here:
https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#32917dd7daa24856a82bdcf256affcd9

also here:
https://constitution.icp-cc.com/#3bfc0e40a875470a901e951fb08fe61b

Actually, the SNEED team is already working to create something like this because they are also a fixed supply token. A lot of SNS DAOs are looking for ways to provide rewards without being forced to do it through inflation.

When liquidity is initially added, it's pretty normal for price to dip a bit, but the liquidity is DAO-owned so it won't rug.

The idea would be that the utility of the $CONF is what would drive demand it over the long term. The commitment for providing this utility is locked into the constitution here:
https://constitution.icp-cc.com/#2e40fa3710f34c25bf439626a0857122

In addition, the DAO could apply interesting incentives such as "VIP Neuron Events" for staking $CONF as explained here:
https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#f44bda0ac53c4f2bbbe7c57cd8eb275b

As always, DYOR & this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy.

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-22 21:13:08 UTC | #12

I can verify that this list was missing Russia!

Also, looks like Ukraine is more of a judgement call, since the sanctions apply to only some regions. Therefore, it'll be removed from the list of restricted countries.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-04-24 11:31:43 UTC | #13

Hi @Seb and @aiv 

Many thanks for sharing your plans for the ICP Community Conference! Here are some initial thoughts from my side. 

The planned conference series sounds great and will certainly be beneficial to the ICP ecosystem. I fully agree that we need more of these kinds of activities. It is interesting to see that you are experimenting with concepts like a council and an LLC in conjunction with a DAO.

I am not sure about the fit with the SNS framework, given its focus on controlling decentralized applications via an on-chain DAO, while your project puts the focus on an off-chain DAO entity. One could argue that meme coin SNSs also do not control an underlying dapp; however, these kinds of projects tend to ask for very little funding and do not seek Neurons’ fund involvement. I am curious to hear what others think.

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-24 12:50:56 UTC | #14

Hi @bjoernek,

ICPCC fits the SNS framework because:

1. It will in fact need to host and control canisters. Aside from the dapp that hosts its legal documentation, it'll also be hosting a "VP Proxy Canister" as [defined here](https://constitution.icp-cc.com/#574df51f1be94b5586ee88a4e6e3d7ed). It will probably also need to host a canister for executing the airdrops.
2. It takes advantage of the ecosystems most trustworthy treasury management platform, the one that's built into every SNS.
3. It takes advantage of the gasless uncensorable interface that's build into every SNS.
4. It's focused on the promotion and good of the entire ICP ecosystem, while having a clear way to provide sustainable growth and return as an ongoing project with a business model.

In short, it cannot be launched without the SNS, and it takes advantage of every feature the SNS was designed to provide.

Also, even if it didn't manage any canisters, DFINITY has never published anything specifying an "no off-chain DAO" stance for SNS projects. Considering that the SNS is designed to provide a robust framework for DAO treasury management, that would seem like a unnecessary limitation to set towards it's future use cases.

In addition, how could anyone predict what an off-chain DAO would end up managing in the future? Aside from the canisters mentioned, ICPCC DAO could very likely end up hosting a full event ticketing mechanism and other types of event-specific dapps.

-------------------------

jamesbeadle | 2024-04-24 13:30:45 UTC | #15

So I read your whitepaper. 

I like the idea of a DAO running events but this doesn't feel very decentralised. It says you will have:

" all newly created SNS neurons will have the ICPCC Council Neuron in their initial ”Following” list"

So you could easily have more than 67% of the vote eventually as new neurons are created. Add in that you are not staking any of the treasury it feels like you could be making a lot of ICP whenever you want.

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-24 14:12:06 UTC | #16

Hey @jamesbeadle,

Great question!

**This would be the DAOs choice:**
First off, it's up to the DAO to decide if new neurons would be set up with the ICPCC Council Neuron (which would be created post-SNS) as a default followee. The DAO members could very well vote to update the constitution to remove that line and then never set things up to work that way. 

The constitution is a living document that'll likely need many edits from and by the DAO. This DAO is so decentralized, there's no core team who can pre-determine it's roadmap and operations, it'll do this itself.

If the DAO decides to not have any neuron followed by default that's totally fine, this doesn't need to be implemented and will not be in place at the SNS launch. The ICPCC Council Neuron would be created and set up after the SNS launch, specifically because this gives the DAO power to decide how it's implemented.

**The council neuron adds protections**
The ICPCC Council Neuron would be owned by a DAO-controlled canister, and not vote on proposals which configure it or treasury transfer proposals.

The ICPCC Council Neuron would also be set up to do things like delay applying the council votes until the last minute of the proposal time period, to maximize time for anyone following it to vote manually.

Without this VP proxy neuron, if DAO members simply follow council members manually there would indeed be the risk of them quickly influencing their followee VP to access the treasury like you suggest. The whole purpose of the ICPCC Council Neuron was to add protections needed to make having a council at all feasible.

Arguably, this is way more decentralized than most SNS DAOs, since almost everyone just follows the core team neuron directly, and that gives the holder the power to pretty much do whatever they want before anyone else even has a chance to read the proposal.

**ICP staking wasn't excluded**
ICP staking wasn't mentioned in the constitution simply because that should be a decision left to the DAO, based on the size of the treasury and what the plans for events are. I certainly do agree that the ICPCC DAO should totally stake some of it's treasury!

-------------------------

Seb | 2024-04-24 15:06:52 UTC | #17

To supplement Isaac's response:

* I confirm that both the frontend and backend infrastructure of the Galactic Airdrop will be transferred to the control of the ICPCC SNS DAO. This airdrop, occurring concurrently with the ICPCC conference, is expected to recur periodically. It operates through an on-chain infrastructure. While it won't initially be included in the decentralization sale, it will be later donated to the ICPCC SNS DAO.
* Furthermore, the NFT Collection from the 2023 ICPCC event will also be placed under the governance of the ICPCC SNS DAO.

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-24 15:06:56 UTC | #18

They @jamesbeadle here's an update:

I just entirely removed the "new neurons would follow the ICPCC Council Neuron by default" language from both the Litepaper and Constitution. It's up the the DAO.

johncharris2019 | 2024-04-24 16:28:37 UTC | #19

I have been a Node Provider for the last several years.  I have followed the continued development of the ICP Ecosystem and look forward to contributing new and exciting DAPPS in the future.  My background as an  entrepreneur, technologist, stakeholder in other ventures, and part of an executive management team charged with bringing value to other stakeholders besides myself, my views are definitely skewed by all of those inputs.  Here is a summation of several points regarding the ICPCC DAO that I believe more than support this new and exciting use of the SNS framework to launch a DAO Governance capability that could potentially be adopted by many organizations for many use cases beyond this one.  Kudos to Isaac and the others that contributed to this novel approach.  My NON-USA colleagues will definitely plan on contributing ICP to this project and hope that others will also. 
 
The ICPCC DAO represents an ambitious and important experiment in decentralized governance and the capabilities of the Internet Computer. By leveraging the SNS framework, on-chain governance, and legal structuring through the Marshall Islands DAO LLC, it pushes the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized organizations.

The recent decision to remove the default following mechanism for the ICPCC Council Neuron underscores the DAO's commitment to putting power and responsibility in the hands of individual community members. This move towards a more decentralized and participant-driven governance model aligns with the core ethos of the ICP and the broader decentralized governance movement.

While this change may introduce new challenges, such as the potential for lower engagement from some new participants, it also opens up exciting possibilities for a more diverse, dynamic, and community-driven governance process. The success of the ICPCC DAO will depend on the community's ability to rise to the challenge of active governance participation and to shape the DAO's evolution through informed decision-making.

If successful, the ICPCC DAO could pioneer a new model for community-driven events and organizations, demonstrating the power of decentralized governance and the Internet Computer to enable innovative, resilient, and globally impactful initiatives.

As the project progresses, it will provide valuable learnings for the broader DAO and blockchain community, while also contributing to the growth and vibrancy of the ICP ecosystem.

The ICPCC DAO is an opportunity for the ICP community to experiment with and shape the future of decentralized governance. While the journey may have risks, the potential rewards - a successful, self-sustaining, and truly community-driven organization - make it an endeavor worth pursuing.

Happy to hear any thoughts others may have.
John

Hey @bjoernek 

I'm Kyle Stoflet, CEO/Founder at The Swop. 
My name is in the initial council member applications which can be found in the ICP CC SNS Litepaper.


I believe that this initiative is needed for the ecosystem, we need something to get people together and build a strong community around. This is how we keep people engaged, and excited about what is being built around the Internet Computer ecosystem, this will even help investors find new opportunities in our ecosystem. The ICP Hubs doing events is great, but simply isn't enough, and we should be encouraging the community to take initiative. We have been long awaiting a conference hosted by the DFINITY Foundation, I recall part of the benefit of winning/placing high in Supernova, was getting tickets to an ICP conference, it was marketed that way at least. I would love to see that  conference come to life, but we can't wait forever for that to happen. I would be very happy to support and attend that conference if it happens! The ICP ecosystem is worthy of having an annual conference(s), it keeps the energy high for the community and grassroot builders who are often less thought about, or even supported.

I can agree that an off-chain DAO could be a scary thing for the network, if organized by a malicious person or project. Let's not forget that we have SNS projects who just drain their treasury and act like everything is okay with that. The SNS isn't perfect, we need more participation around the projects launching instead of a few whales/entities who can collude to pass or reject proposals. 

I love the thought of the community voting on the council, and having a constitution around the ICP CC, it's set to hold everyone accountable. To me, seems like a SNS worthy of experimenting with doing an off-chain DAO, it already has a lot of structure in place to validate that the ICP CC is in fact a serious SNS candidate. I welcome everyone's opinion, and would love to hear both sides to see a healthy discussion take place here.

Overall my thoughts are that 160,000 ICP at max raise is a tiny fraction of what should really be raised for the Internet Computer to start having annual conferences. I believe we should have more conference events that form to help give our ecosystem a healthy boost in it's public image. Which could inspire many new investors to enter the ecosystem.

justmythoughts | 2024-04-25 06:30:36 UTC | #21

@bjoernek 

I'm a little frustrated with the communications here from DFINITY, so I'll try to lay out my reasoning as to why.

First off, I'm not saying I disagree with you about the off-chain piece. I've been very critical about all SNSes in the past on these forums, and the risks posed by the tight coupling between the the SNS and NNS.

That being said, there's the case of [EstateDAO](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-estatedao-sns-decentralization-sale/28285), a vacation home & real estate venture that ["came out of stealth mode"](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/overview-of-estatedao-revolutionizing-vacation-home-investment/26812?u=justmythoughts) in January and just SNSed with full DFINITY support.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128910

![Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 22.01.15|690x205](upload://6YOoAZxbD0ssA61Bt3N91zetoKT.png)

As of April 25th, 8:30am Zurich time (the time of this post), this is the full list of properties currently available on [EstateDAO's website](https://wbdy5-yyaaa-aaaap-abysq-cai.icp0.io).

![Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 23.01.21|591x499](upload://zQbyGUsqrNvJcovCv27t62Cc36m.png)

Again, this application was in "stealth mode" for 2 years, and has a single property listed. The [EstateDAO SNS thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-estatedao-sns-decentralization-sale/28285/21) has zero feedback from DFINITY as of the time of this post.

DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) is a new and experimental place for crypto and blockchain right now. I would put both EstateDAO and ICPCC in this category. In fact, in a way [ORIGYN's gold backed NFTs](https://twitter.com/ORIGYNTech/status/1736771572105347333), which have a significant off-chain component also fall into this category.

EstateDAO Minimum Commitment:    75k ICP
EstateDAO Maximum Commitment:   500k ICP
ICPCC DAO Minimum Commitment:  25k ICP
ICPCC DAO Maximum Commitment: 160k ICP

Many of us in the ICP community were originally excited when DFINITY promised the community a conference after the [Supernova Hackathon](https://dfinity.org/supernova/) in June 2022, with up to 6 "Free Tickets" to the first ICP conference as the prize for the winning team of each track (there were 6 tracks total) . 

![Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 22.06.54|690x330](upload://pmp8NA9dO34mg8REEegF2Dr4F00.png)

A DFINITY backed ICP conference never materialized over the following 12 months, and in 2023 the ICP community organized the very first ICP Community Conference (ICPCC) in Miami Florida.

**Note: The first ICP Community Conference did not receive a single promotional tweet or mention from DFINITY, nor did a single currently employed full-time employee from DFINITY (not contractor) attend.** No attendees were there on behalf of, or representing DFINITY.

Despite the lack of support from DFINITY, the conference was full of ICP projects and leaders throughout the ecosystem, from ORIGYN to NFID, @skilesare, @lastmjs, @bob11, and more.

The 2023 ICPCC was completely funded by private investors in the ICP ecosystem. In-person conferences are expensive to facilitate, albeit putting on a community conference in the middle of the 2023 bear market has a huge positive impact in fostering connections, introducing new builders and investors to ICP, and just getting people excited again about the ecosystem.

As for connecting the blockchain with in-person events, at 2023's ICPCC the physical [Ntagled](the https://twitter.com/ntagled) wallet project put together badges for that conference that airdropped all sorts of tokens to participants. It was actually really neat. 

![image|666x500](upload://jMEyTmVtiUYgBvRpPgWb1PztvvI.jpeg)

I know that other projects like AstroX have also been working on physical wallet infrastructure, and in fact DFINITY came to Bitcoin Miami the following week handing out ckBTC (DFINITY did not attend ICPCC).
https://x.com/dfinity/status/1660918566076440580

Regardless of who puts on the conference, I hope we can all agree that ICP needs a conference for the **entire community** that includes DFINITY, builders, users, investors, and everyone in-between who's curious about what's possible on web3. These conferences will celebrate the ICP community and provide a way for newcomers to learn about the ecosystem.

The funds for these conferences need to come from somewhere, and in the absence of DFINITY a DAO is an novel way to manage how conference funds are managed. And by responsible, I mean definitely **NOT** like this:
https://cointelegraph.com/news/dogwifhat-price-hits-record-high-las-vegas-sphere-crowdfund

<br/>
<br/>

As NNS voters I think we're all trying to figure out what should and shouldn't be an SNS, but @bjoernek as the current sole respondent from DFINITY I hope you can appreciate these frustrations in reading your post:

1. DFINITY hinted at an Internet Computer Developer Conference, awarded tickets, did not put on a conference and still hasn't (3 years since genesis).
2. DFINITY did not support or send guest speakers on behalf of DFINITY to the first ICPCC.
3. DFINITY just supported an DePin DAO project several weeks ago, voting "Yes" on [Estate DAO's](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128910) SNS without providing a single critical piece of feedback.

<br/>
<br/>

@bjoernek regardless of if DFINITY thinks ICPCC is a good SNS project, it would really mean a lot to those attending to see both technical and roadmap/vision talks from DFINITY engineering and cryptography leaders such as yourself, @Manu, @ais, and others at ICPCC.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-04-25 07:17:13 UTC | #22

Thank you @justmythoughts for your detailed feedback!

Regarding your points on ICP Community Conference: I fully agree with you that this is a great initiative and seems very useful for the whole ICP ecosystem (as I also mentioned in my initial reply). I do not have context on past conferences and DFINITY's involvement and thus I cannot comment on that.  Personally, I would happy to contribute to an upcoming ICPCC, if schedules allow it.

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-04-25 10:48:33 UTC | #23

Hey guys, I'm a fan of ICPCC and I think this is really interesting but I have some concerns that you can hopefully address.

Blockchains coupled with DAO's, give users and the community a chance to own a piece of their favourite dApp. The cool thing with the SNS, is that if the community wanted they could fork the repo -> write code for a feature they want to see added -> and create a proposal to add it. This to me is one of the most important use-cases of DAOs and huge selling point for participating in an SNS. The whole point of DAO's (to me) is removing centralised corporate networks that make changes to their apps without  "governance proposals" or consulting their users (which historically has meant entrepreneurs, users and creators have lost out).

I can be sure that if the founding team disappear I can create proposals and maintain a dApp (if it's sufficiently decentralised). The power is in the users hands and that's what Web3 is all about.

With an off-chain DAO ICPCC are trying to over-haul this whole paradigm and I can't see how it will work and what the point is? If there is no dApp or code (I'm not sure airdrop canisters constitute a dApp) - what does the community and the user own by owning this token? What changes can they actually make apart from proposals to move funds around and "motion proposals"?

I think it's interesting but I can't see how it will work and what the point is - wouldn't this be better as just a normal non-profit organisation with a fun ICRC-1 token for events?

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-25 13:18:00 UTC | #24

Hey @dfxjesse, great questions!

First, "off-chain DAO" is a bit of a misnomer, since all these aspects are still on chain:

* Treasury Management
* Governance Decisions
* Governance Mechanisms (VP Proxy Canister)
* Tools and resources (Airdrop canisters, etc)
* Governance Operations & Definitions (Constitution)
* Legal Agreements (hired council members, vendor agreements, etc)
* Corporate Personhood (legal registration documents)

The cool thing with the SNS, is that if the community wanted they could fork the repo → write code for a feature they want to see added → and create a proposal to add it.
[/quote]

In the case of the ICPCC, the exact same thing could be done with the ICPCC Constitution. It's a binding document empowered by the Corporate Personhood given to the DAO by the Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This type of legal entity REQUIRES the existence of an on-chain DAO, and it recognizes the on chain aspects of that DAO as legally binding. You can find out more [here](https://constitution.icp-cc.com/#3a0392c7870f410bbe1ce507cf0807d2) and [here](https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#fb13507edd984fe6af70c587400917bc).

The whole point of DAO’s (to me) is removing centralised corporate networks that make changes to their apps without “governance proposals” or consulting their users
[/quote]

Exactly! The ICPCC DAO doesn't delegate any power to the ICPCC Council to make decisions for it, they are just vendors hired to shape proposals for the DAO to vote on. All authority and decision-making power stays with the DAO members, and again those on-chain decisions are legally binding.

For example, the DAO is the only owner of the ICPCC brand and Intellectual Property, and if someone uses these without an explicit proposal from the DAO granting them that right, the DAO can hire a lawyer to sue them. The ICPCC DAO is a fully decentralized independent actor with no agents making decisions on its behalf.

I can be sure that if the founding team disappear I can create proposals and maintain a dApp (if it’s sufficiently decentralised). The power is in the users hands and that’s what Web3 is all about.
[/quote]

There is no traditional "core team" with ICPCC, again the ICPCC Council is a completely different structure. The entire council is replaceable and everything can run without them. You can see my [recent tweet about the council here](https://x.com/isaac_icp/status/1782855048227090801), and [read about it here](https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#1834c229c50c46e1b56b071f7978a8ef).

[quote="dfxjesse, post:23, topic:29878"]
what does the community and the user own by owning this token?
[/quote]

They own:

1. Utility for the physical in person events, as [defined in the constitution](https://constitution.icp-cc.com/#2e40fa3710f34c25bf439626a0857122).
2. Influence over all the decisions the DAO makes, since all those decisions must be made through SNS proposals for them to be legally binding.
3. Influence over how the DAO treasury can be used, since that can only be accessed on chain.
4. Influence over how the ICPCC brand and intellectual property are used, since those are also assets owned by the DAO and therefore exclusively controllable via on-chain proposals.

[quote="dfxjesse, post:23, topic:29878"]
What changes can they actually make apart from proposals to move funds around and “motion proposals”?
[/quote]

They can hire and fire members of the ICPCC Council. I'd also argue that they would have just as much, if not more, power than the board of any major company (which is basically all the power).

In additions, there's even a framework for adding power to motion proposals. For example, ignoring them would be grounds for a council member to be fired. This is called "Request Motions," and it's [outlined in the constitution here](https://constitution.icp-cc.com/#a368f197979e4251a428494a8541b527).

[quote="dfxjesse, post:23, topic:29878"]
wouldn’t this be better as just a normal non-profit organisation with a fun ICRC-1 token for events
[/quote]

No, for the reasons explained in the [litepaper here](https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#86cfbc5e23c64797978d5869f02bab81).

Not only would that mean the community would lack true ownership and control, it would mean a single centralized party would:

* Exclusively receive all of the gains from successful and profitable events, even though it's the community who would be making that success possible.
* Censor ecosystem brands they don't like from sponsoring the event, without anyone else knowing they did it.
* Gatekeep what gets highlighted most.
* Be accountable to no one, and lack transparency and accountability to the community they are meant to support.

**Why "Off-Chain" Matters**
Ultimately, most "real world" value is exactly that: It happens in the real world.

Web3 is wonderful, but only so far as it makes an impact to the physical users it creates value for. In that sense, all DAOs need to be "off-chain" to an extent, since a dapp that results in no ultimate real world impact is useless.

Some types of value can be more exclusively created on chain, like economic value. However, there are other types, like "ownership" or "legal authority" rely on real world legal structures like the Marshall Islands DAO LLC to be created.

However, this type of value can still only be controlled on chain, which makes it no different than economic value. What is "economic value" if not a representation of trust that someone else will be willing to trade this asset for another? Unless "value" is something physical like food, clothing, or shelter, it's just an idea.

If Web3 doesn't master off-chain DAOs, it's going to have an extremely limited impact on the future. The innovation around "off-chain DAOs" is an area that can have real power, real decentralization, and real impact. To dismiss it because it doesn't look like the defi dapps we're used to would be shortsighted.

Hey @dfxjesse, thanks for joining the conversation! 

*You're a Motoko Bootcamp graduate. Where did you go when I was raving about DAOs for hours?*  😁

Let's browse over your points:

* It's interesting that you see the main advantage of the SNS framework as letting users contribute to the source code of their favorite dApp. Yet, it's been a year, and we haven't seen anyone, to my current knowledge, actually do this. Right now, the real benefit we're getting from SNSs is **transparency**.

* Let's be real, current teams can easily pass technical proposals in their SNS DAOs whenever they want. I'm not saying that's bad; it makes sense considering how early we are in the process.

* I believe that limiting the use-cases of DAOs and by extent tools such as the SNS framework to control the source code of dApps is a limited vision of the true potential of DAOs. DAOs are more than just technical tools; they represent a new way of organizing human interactions—how we work, collaborate, and live together. This has deep societal implications. We should be exploring full time and not limiting use cases.

**Why use the SNS Framework?**

* **Transparency**: All decisions related to fund usage, roadmap, and strategic decisions are completely transparent.

* **Complete On-chain History**: There's a full record of all decisions, votes, previous constitutions, and documents.

* **Control Over Treasury**: We know this system is secure since it has been securing millions of $ for over a year. That's a strong selling point.

* **Software Control**: Even if this DAO isn’t currently focused on software development, let's just pause and imagine what an ICP event will look like in 5 years. Think about having an ICP conference—live-streamed on an ICP-native platform, tickets as NFTs that grant access to exclusive groups on OpenChat, DSCVR portals, Catalyze groups, events in the Yuku metaverse, and much more. We are moving into the metaverse and this DAO is highly likely to extend the number of software it controls and communicates with.

* **Access to SNS Tools**: Numerous #ICP dApps (OpenChat, ICDex...) are building tools and integration with the SNS framework. Having an SNS DAO enables a native connection with those apps.

The SNS framework is currently the best way to launch a DAO on ICP (and actually in the entire crypto-space) due to its reputation, security, and integration in the #ICP ecosystem. I hope in the next few years we will be able to design and explore other frameworks but currently all of us are limited by time, expertise, and funds.

----


ICPCC or not, one day someone is going to use the Internet Computer and the SNS framework to set up a DAO that is about a **shared mission**. And it won't be about making software. The ICP ecosystem hasn't broken out yet because there's a mix-up between on-chain dApps and what building a DAO means. Software is just a tool. The ICPCC DAO, by its nature of being a collective event with a strong community involvement, has a unique position and an actual chance of evolving as a DAO.

I think many aspects of a conference could be run from an open source repo, for example let's say they want to budget 500 ICP for live entertainment, this could be in a repo titled "Entertainment Budget". If you disagree, you could fork the Entertainment Budget repo, and update to 400 ICP, submit a PR, then submit a proposal with your reasoning why you think it should be lower. This could be true for agendas, speakers, accommodations, merch, etc..

At this point, treasury proposals could be created to pay the listed parties in the repo and you'd have public accountability that the intended parties were paid the proposed amounts.

It seems the intent from the constitution is to use dfinity forums for comms, but Imo nothing clashes with the SNS model here, they are just not utilizing some aspects, which I think is fine too.

-------------------------

Mitch | 2024-04-25 15:26:37 UTC | #27

The constitution is very well thought out, other SNSs should take notes, very cool. Best of luck to the team!

A first of it's kind SNS DAO. Will be a trailblazer for a new bread and potentially larger class of DAOs.

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-25 18:14:28 UTC | #29

Using a github repo is actually a brilliant idea!

I also think Catalyze might be building some custom tools for events, probably with parameters that could be given over the DAO's control.

Hey everyone!

# UPDATE #1: No NF Participation
I had a great call with @bjoernek & [Lomesh](https://twitter.com/lomeshdutta) earlier today.

They graciously provided clarity regarding DFINITY's position regarding the launch of "Off-Chain" DAOs on the SNS. In short, they view these a bit similar to how they view other community-based projects such as meme tokens.

Specifically, **DFINITY has agreed to abstain from voting on the ICPCC SNS Launch proposal that'll be submitted on May 4th, so long as the SNS will not be participating in the neuron fund**.

We understand their reasoning and are very happy DFINITY will be leaving this vote up to the community's decision! They truly have the good of the ICP community at heart, and for this type of SNS DAO direct commitment SNS participation really is the best fit, so this SNS will not be participating in the Neuron Fund.

# UPDATE #2: Min ICP Raised = 1 ICP!
To further give this DAO over to the will of the ICP community, the minimum direct contribution amount to this SNS launch is being reduced to 1 ICP.

This solidifies the fact that the primary purpose of this SNS launch is to decentralize the established ICPCC IP and brand under the complete control of an SNS DAO, rather than to raise funds. Whatever amount is raised during the SNS launch, the DAO can always collect sponsorships to fund events just like all other conference brands (this was already part of the design of the DAO).

Conference brands are usually profitable starting on their 3rd year, and the new SNS DAO will be hosting the 3rd ICPCC event in 2025, so the intention was always for the DAO to start hosting profitable events from day #1.

What matters most is that the community is 100% in control. The ICP community decides what is contributed to help kick-start the next few ICP conferences. Once the DAO is launched, the community is in control of deciding how big these events will be!

## Reminder: 80,000 ICP Early Bird Incentive
The reduced minimum direct commit still doesn't change the early-bird incentive. 4% of the CONF token supply will still be airdropped to SNS principals that contribute any of the first 80,000 ICP during this SNS launch! You can [read more about this here](https://litepaper.icp-cc.com/#a2746da7322c4712ac04ae3f366304ed).

This is an awesome development!  Glad to see things moving forward.  This will be a really interesting experiment and I'm hopeful to be where ever the conference ends up being to share a conversation, a drink, a meal, a laugh, and whatever group therapy we need :joy:.

Maybe a bug, also maybe not the thread for this but i just spotted a discrepancy in the SNS sale.

So it says the SNS has succeeded even though the minimum amount of participants hasn't been reached. I am missing something?
