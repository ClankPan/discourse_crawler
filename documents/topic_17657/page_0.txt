Speaking to Andrew and he suggested I raise this 

**Preface**
I don't want to be involved, argue back and forth or debate -  I wanted to raise this for the people here to do so
 
I'm raising this as I believe its the core issue that lead to the fracture of the community and addressing this will add a much needed layer of stability and remove need for trust 

I don't have the ability to put this into code but I am in sincere belief this is in major benefit for Dfinity as an organisation to lead and address this problem

**Problem**
Tokenomic changes have dire and extensive consequences across ICP including: 
- Project treasury management 
- Personal investments 
- Potential investor perception 
- Public perception

Investors and builders value a stable environment to build in - this is recognised by Dom clearly since I read his tokenomic change proposal early on in the year so feel we're on the same page there 

However, it is concerning that something with such dire consequences, that does not NEED changing on the regular, can be changed with such ease 

While I don't think we need to work exactly like ETH does, Tokenomics is a great example of where ETH shows us how it could be done - A Super Majority (Tried to find doc to explain this - might be able to provide later on how its done) 

**Potential Solution**
1. create a new proposal type called tokenomics which will be separate from governance proposals and is only for changes to tokenomics
2. make the voting period on these proposals 30 days (this assumes manual overrides are in place for followed neurons)
3. in order to pass it requires 2/3rds of available voting power be executed

**Personal and final thoughts**
The above can be modified however we wish, aim is not to solutionize the problem but to give a framework to get to the final solution via discussion 

If this leads down the road of - "Is this even a problem?" I don't know what to tell you. From where I stand its the most OBVIOUS and IMPORTANT problem for ICP and Dfinity to address to encourage adoption 

What I would like to see is this being driven to a conclusion with a solution that doesn't leave the future of Tokenomics fully in the hands of Named Neurons - to return confidence current and potential stakeholders 

Nice Taggr post @mechaquan created a while back: https://taggr.top/#/post/11098

Thank you for taking this to the forum, very well written post!

I'm generally in favor of a version of this. Haven't yet heard arguments why this wouldn't be a good idea, so I'd love to see discussion around the topic. The only danger I see is if the % of voting power who votes on proposals doesn't increase, that would mean no tokenomics changes will ever be implemented, which is also not what we want.

Currently only 50% available voting power votes. I suggest coming up with thresholds that still allows for occasional tokenomics changes if the majority agrees. Let's say at least 50% of voting power particpates of which at least 66% adopts the change.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-26 15:02:06 UTC | #3

Thank you for raising this idea in a diplomatic way @theguy.  Well done.

I would support this idea, especially points 1 and 2 as written.  

However, I think point 3 would cause this type of proposal to fail as written since we don't have 2/3 of available voting power voting on Governance topics yet.  If you change the content to a practical requirement then it will strengthen the proposal.  I have copied the definition of Simple Majority from the dashboard and modified it to reflect a potential definition of Super Majority that hopefully meets the intent of your proposal.

* **Super Majority**: When the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted if a super majority (more than 2/3 of the votes cast) has voted Yes and those votes constitute at least 6% of the total voting power. Otherwise, the proposal is rejected. Before a proposal is decided by Super Majority, the voting period can be extended in order to ‚Äú**wait for quiet**‚Äù. Such voting period extensions occur when a proposal‚Äôs voting results turn from either a Yes majority to a No majority or vice versa.



What do you think?

For comparison, below are the definitions of Absolute Majority and Simple Majority that exist today...

There are two ways a proposal can be decided:
1. **Absolute Majority**: Before the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted or rejected if an absolute majority (more than half of the total voting power) has voted Yes or No on the proposal, respectively.
2. **Simple Majority**: When the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted if a simple majority (more than half of the votes cast) has voted Yes and those votes constitute at least 3% of the total voting power. Otherwise, the proposal is rejected. Before a proposal is decided by Simple Majority, the voting period can be extended in order to ‚Äú**wait for quiet**‚Äù. Such voting period extensions occur when a proposal‚Äôs voting results turn from either a Yes majority to a No majority or vice versa.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-26 14:36:24 UTC | #4

I think this is a good idea because I believe tokenomics changes should be hard, but we also know from experience that deliberating them on the forum is not enough to adequately spread the word about a proposal that is in deliberation.  Don't get me wrong, I do think that a sizable majority of the voting body is paying attention to the forum, but a sizable majority of the community is not interested in the forum.  We have many examples of ideas being discussed as short as a week and as long as several months on the forum, but when the proposal is submitted to the NNS there are many people in the community who are caught unaware.  The release of a proposal through the NNS creates a heightened sense of awareness within the community and people simply need time to digest the meaning and implications of passing a proposal that results in tokenomics changes. Hence, making it a separate proposal topic and giving more time seems like a good way to ensure everyone knows what is going on and can make informed decisions.  I see no need to rush decisions on tokenomics changes.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-26 15:55:14 UTC | #5

My understanding is that this is not possible for technical reasons. Seems strange that something so simple isn‚Äôt possible but hey it‚Äôs what a very senior Dfinity dev that worked on the NNS told me. 

Before diving into pros and cons I think we need to have a technical person explain what we can and can‚Äôt do and why.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-26 16:00:53 UTC | #6

I hat being the downer in the room, but until we get our ducks in a row about how this damn thing actually works, we are going to keep talking in circles.

1. Tokenomics changes are code changes at the replica or system canister management level.
2. we have topics for those.
3. They take 50% to charge.
4. The system cannot decipher between a tokenomics change and the change in the font color in NNS.ic0.app
5. If you change these to 2/3 you are changing all code changes to 2/3 and increasing stall points for everything.

Enabling what you are proposing likely requires a fundamental reorganization of what the NNS is. It isn't impossible, but we need to cast it at the right level of magnitude. The dfinity devs have a much clearer view of how all this works, so I'm happy to be corrected, but I would classify changing voting thresholds to 2/3 in order of magnitude of "blowing it all up and starting from scratch" level of effort. (Or raise the bar on all proposals to 2/3 which would be easy but likely a different kind of discussion).

create a new proposal type
[/quote]

I think this is a great idea on it's own so we're not having the same type of proposals popping up all the time to counter previous proposals.  For example a front-end design can be proposed and passed, but then there should be a period of time where it's not revisited again, unless there is a breaking change perhaps, because it is in a certain category.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-12-26 16:31:15 UTC | #8

Could add key parts of tokenomics into mutable variables right? Then make proposal type that hits that method that changes that variable.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-26 16:32:42 UTC | #9

Yes...that would work well.  Most of the tokenomics proposals have been more substantial than that though. Moving stuff to on chain governance is a good pathway, but not immune to fools like me that come and rearrange the deck chairs.üòÇ

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-12-26 16:34:13 UTC | #10

Lol also the fact that we can bypass the super
Majority by just doing a code change proposal.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-12-26 16:42:49 UTC | #11

Anyways I also would love it if tokenomic changes where super majority.

Maybe all tokenomics can be derived from a separate canister and then changes to that canister need to be super majority.

Assuming there isn‚Äôt some other architectural obstacle. @skilesare

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-26 18:16:55 UTC | #12

I think it's a chicken or an egg kind of thing. If you put all the tokenomics on to a canister that can only be changed by 2/3 majority, then the system, the queries that canister could be changed to point to a different canister by 50% vote.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is the same pattern that caused the spam issue . Anytime you make something worth more or harder than something else you drastically complicate how your system works.

A better solution might be some kind of bicameral system; or maybe an emergency veto that only requires 1/3 to invoke. That way the happy path is always still 50%, but if something does jump up and have significant changes in it 1/3 of the vote can block implementation. 

This would give one third of the NNS power to block any advancement, but we kind of already have that ratio built into our node providers.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-26 21:03:26 UTC | #13

There is a precedent for changing the definition of majority voting on the NNS.  From genesis until sometime around the end of Oct 21 all proposals were decided by Absolute Majority.  Some time in Nov 2021 DFINITY implemented the Simple Majority criteria (proposal ?) and shortly afterward increased the wait for quiet mechanism [(proposal 33658)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/33658) from 1 day to 4 days minimum voting period.  All of these changes were needed and I don't think it required starting from scratch.

There is also precedent for the idea of creating new proposal categories.  Replica Version Management and SNS & Community Fund were both created within the last several months.  In both cases, the neuron Followee assignments were configured to match the Governance topic configuration by default so people would not be caught off guard without having a Followee configured.  

I don't see why a new proposal topic can't be created for tokenomics proposals (and possibly other parameters that should be hard to change) that uses an Absolute Majority / Super Majority mechanism while all other proposal topics continue to use the Absolute Majority / Simple Majority mechanism.  I would love to hear someone from the DFINITY NNS team comment on the viability of this concept.  

It is clear that DFINITY is the only organization that can implement this type of proposal, so it would be best if they are involved in the discussion early anyway.  There is no point in the community spending a lot of time and energy on this deliberation unless DFINITY is willing to engage and signal their willingness to put it on their roadmap if it passes.  In other words, before submitting this proposal, it would be best to know that there is a path to code implementation (even if the timeline cannot be detailed at this stage).

I like it. When you say 2/3 of available voting power, do you mean of the voting power actually used to vote, or do you mean of total available that could possibly vote? Only concern is that Dfinity gets an even larger role in this issue, since 2/3 will almost certainly require their approval.

Regardless, I support the proposal. Tokenomics changes should be deliberate and debated.

I don't mean to imply that there wouldn't be things we could still use, but the founding assumptions would need to be different. As I mentioned...there is no issue if you want to impose 2/3 across the board. The dilemma is when you want to impose 2/3 on one category but code change is still 50%.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 11:02:10 UTC | #17

Should be 2/3rds of available voting power‚Ä¶so for example you‚Äôd need 33.4% of total available voting power to vote adopt in order to pass.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 11:14:15 UTC | #18

I get point #5 which was why I was initially suggesting limiting to just tokenomics proposals but you raise a good point wrt to code changes requiring a simple 50% majority.

Could we just make it 2/3rds across the board with some sort of emergency contingency?

I mean let‚Äôs be honest, a vast majority of people follow Dfinity for all things not governance so in theory and practice they have an emergency contingency already‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen Dfinity raise a code change proposal vote on it which then gets all the follower vote triggered and the proposal is executed within an hour‚Ä¶ below is an example‚Ä¶which took a little over two hours from being raised to being executed‚Ä¶best part is‚Ä¶ it received 99.4% !

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/97896

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 12:29:52 UTC | #19

The NNS always reports voting statistics in terms of total voting power, so it adds confusion if you try to redefine terminology.  The available voting power is total voting power, not the voting power that is cast on Governance proposal topics.  The amount of voting power that is cast on Governance topics changes with every vote.  It seems you may be trying to impose an impossibly high standard, which is a non-starter for me.  Please bring this back to a more sensible concept.  For example, DFINITY should be able to abstain from a proposal on tokenomics and it should still be possible for it to pass.  This would happen when DFINITY wants the community to decide a proposal, which has happened often.  There should not be a minimum threshold that can only be met when DFINITY casts their vote.  Setting a minimum threshold based on prior voting participation rates does not make sense to me.  I recommend you take the existing definition of Simple Majority and modify parameters (without changing definitions) it to match your intent.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 14:13:53 UTC | #20

You seem to not understand what I‚Äôm saying so instead of asking to clarify you assume it‚Äôs the worst possible interpretation and then start arguing against that üòÇ

This is the same concept previously discussed.

- total available voting power is on the dashboard
- I just added the term available because that‚Äôs the available VP at a point in time which does not consider ICP not staked etc‚Ä¶as neurons age or ICP is locked/unlocked that number changes
- need 2/3rds of this dashboard number executed not in support of
- since Dfinity/ICA is 22.6% of the available you‚Äôd need 66.7% of the remaining 77.4% which is possible even if it would be difficult but that‚Äôs kinda the point, right?  However I would hope that Dfinity would support if +50% of the community did.

Also, I added the 33.4% adopted because it might make more sense to do it that way rather than 2/3rds because imagine a minority of people abstaining to prevent it reaching 2/3rds when it‚Äôs received +50% of total available voting power.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-27 15:28:44 UTC | #21

This is why we might want to think about the 1/3 veto as an alternative to supermajority.

1: it adds a cost to a veto, so you will need to really want to imitate it.
2. The code changes would be minimal.
3. It leaves a happy path for non-controversial proposals.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 16:16:00 UTC | #22

So does this basically mean that if 1/3 reject the the proposal is rejected?

If so what happens if there is 84% of total available voting power executed with 50.6% for and 33.4% against?!

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-27 16:24:56 UTC | #23

No...this means that someone can initiate a veto proposal that will temporarily block the vetoed proposal(only one allowed per proposal). If it gets 1/3 voting power to endorse it then the target proposal is permanently blocked.  If it expires with less than 1/3 and the target passed with >50% then the target executes.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 16:31:43 UTC | #24

Ok that‚Äôs kinda the same thing‚Ä¶I know it‚Äôs a big what if‚Ä¶but that proposal could get 50% of total VP for it‚Ä¶so how would that make sense?

You could potentially end up with a small group (equal to 1/3 VP) just aggressively vetoing everything, right?

And how would that proposal being permanently blocked actually be enforceable?  What would stop people from raising other proposals and voting to accept?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 16:55:14 UTC | #25

I understood your first clarification, but you second clarification just made it even more complicated.  I‚Äôll stand by my main points:

Super majority shouldn‚Äôt:
* be an impossibly high threshold
* require DFINITY to vote
* be based on the voting power cast on the last governance proposal
* redefine existing terminology

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 16:59:45 UTC | #26

This is an interesting idea.  Will you please expand on the details.  Have you posted this elsewhere in the past?

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 17:17:41 UTC | #27

- it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶it‚Äôs 2/3rds of the total available voting power on the dashboard which is needed to executed
- it doesn‚Äôt
- I‚Äôve never mentioned anything to do with previous VP executed on gov proposals‚Ä¶strawman?!
- lol‚Ä¶whatever‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just trying to clarify that total voting power is a fluid number so it would need to be better defined

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-27 18:37:47 UTC | #28

No...it just kind of came to me last night.  I think people just want recourse if something cray-cray comes out of left field.  98% of the time we want the happy path.

Since code changes are the only way to actually do anything until it is codified into its own on-chain executable topic we have to work on that basis.  We don't want a super-majority for font changes on the NNS, but we do want to be able to block big changes when necessary.

Thus a veto buy a super-minority instead of a super majority.

Example:

Alice proposes to mint 5,000,000 ICP to be distributed to Synapse members in proposal 989898 by adding a line of rust code that mints the code in the nns ledger canister with wasm 383838838383.

Bob invokes a veto of proposal 989898. It needs 1/3 voting power(total VP) to pass.

Synapse is able to get 51% VP, but the veto gets 40% to veto. (How does this happen...maybe crazy following relationships....strange timing...etc).

There isn't an actual difference between needing two-thirds to pass and having a 1/3 veto if everyone is online and paying attention, but in a real messy world...and one with difficult narratives, it could be much more flexible and less contentious.

Yes...a cabal of 1/3 could block everything under this scenario.  But 1/3 of malicious nodes can stop the blockchain too.  Maybe this isn't a great idea, but we may have to pick if having a possible 1/3 blocker is worth the spirit of making sure some things are hard.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 18:42:45 UTC | #29

Voting participation displayed on the dashboard is is total voting power cast on the last *governance* proposal divided by the total voting power that exists in the NNS.  The current voting participation value for *governance* is 50.82% including the vote by DFINITY (because they voted).  

Simple math‚Ä¶
50.82% * 2/3 = 33.88%

If you want to define super majority as exceeding this 33.8% threshold of Yes votes, then I believe it is an impractically high threshold.  It requires DFINITY to vote.  In fact, it requires all neurons who voted on the last governance proposal to vote on an tokenomics change even if they prefer to abstain.  Any large neuron that believes there should be zero changes to tokenomics can choose to follow on the Governance topic and unfollow on this new Tokenomics topic, which immediately biases the threshold to a value more stringent than 2/3.

As an example, Arthur‚Äôs neuron currently triggers 5.8% VP and follows Synapse.  Synapse triggers 10.9% including Arthur‚Äôs neuron because he follows Synapse.  Yet he has gone on record saying that he believes there should be no tokenomics changes.  He can assert his will on the NNS by making it 5.8% more difficult to pass a tokenomics change by ensuring he never votes on the Tokenomics topics.  Now imaging many genesis whale neuron adopt the same practice.  They don‚Äôt have to vote No‚Ä¶all they have to do is Abstain because the definition of success for a Tokenomics proposal is based on the scorecard of Governance voting participation.

Hence, I see this as an impossibly high threshold for the definition of super majority.  This is starting to feel more like an underhanded attempt to gatekeep NNS changes, which would be terribly disappointing.  I would appreciate if you will be more explicit on your definition and where you are getting your numbers.  The dashboard does not define a specific term called total available voting power.  It defines Total Voting Power and Voting Participation on Governance topics.

An example of how impractical the definition so far‚Ä¶
33% Yes - 0 % No and the Tokenomics proposal Fails because it doesn‚Äôt exceed the 33.88% threshold that is set based on the last result of a Governance proposal.

Show me where I‚Äôm wrong and I will edit this post accordingly.  I want this proposal to be practical and I want it to pass, but not if this is your definition of super majority.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 18:49:03 UTC | #30

This seems like an idea worth exploring further.  I guess a Tokenomics proposal would need to not be implemented immediately so there is time for a veto proposal to surface.  I see nothing wrong with this because I do believe tokenomics changes should be carefully considered, transparent, and take time.  I‚Äôm all for practical solutions that lead to the happy path.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 19:04:12 UTC | #32

That‚Äôs what I thought you meant originally when we discussed this on Taggr.  So 2/3 of Total Voting Power (dashboard definition) voting Yes on a Tokenomics proposal would be a 66.6% threshold that has never been achieved on any Governance proposal since it was removed from All Topics.  It gets me back to my concern that this is an impossibly high threshold.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 19:37:04 UTC | #33

If that was your original point then why did you go on some tangent about governance voting that I never mentioned?!

Yes, it‚Äôs harder to pass than the current ~50% which only needs Dfinity + 3%.  That‚Äôs kinda the point‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt need to rush changes.

This is why I also said 30 day voting period (with manual override throughout).  This pushes more decentralization than the Dfinity +3 and requires more community engagement.

Are you against more decentralization and community engagement in order to get changes (specifically ones that impact tokenomics) passed?!

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-27 19:58:15 UTC | #34

Your numbers don‚Äôt add up and they are impractical either way.  My point is that you should propose something reasonable if your goal is meaningful change.  Otherwise it seems you are wasting everyone‚Äôs time.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-27 20:28:57 UTC | #35

What numbers don‚Äôt add up?  Dfinity/ICA have 22.6% of the voting power so they only need 3% to vote with them to pass something at current rate of ~50% for governance proposals.

I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôd be nice if they needed a little more than 3% and it would be great if proposals required more community engagement to pass.

So what % of Total (available) Voting Power do you think is reasonable? 60%?  55%?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-28 02:28:52 UTC | #36

I gave my suggestion for a Super Majority definition in a previous comment, which is a modification based on our current definition of Simple Majority.  It evaluates super majority relative to total voting power cast.

[quote="wpb, post:3, topic:17657"]
**Super Majority**: When the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted if a super majority (more than 2/3 of the votes cast) has voted Yes and those votes constitute at least 6% of the total voting power. Otherwise, the proposal is rejected. Before a proposal is decided by Super Majority, the voting period can be extended in order to ‚Äú**wait for quiet**‚Äù. Such voting period extensions occur when a proposal‚Äôs voting results turn from either a Yes majority to a No majority or vice versa.
[/quote]

I don't believe the threshold for approval of a Tokenomics proposal should be relative to Total Voting Power except to maintain the Absolute Majority definition that currently applies.  It should be relative to voting power cast like it is today with the Simple Majority definition.  I would be completely fine with changing from 50% to 2/3 majority if it is a comparison relative to voting power cast, but not if it applies relative to Total Voting Power.  This distinction is really important because of the fact that we do not have full participation in governance.

It seems like a useful exercise to look at how these definitions would have applied to a few examples of past Tokenomics related proposals:

[Proposal 34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485): Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights
* 11.7 % YES - 0.1 % NO (DFINITY abstained)
* exceeds the 2/3 majority relative to total votes cast
* does not exceed 2/3 majority relative to Total Voting Power
* If this proposal was not implemented, default following would still include the Governance topic and DFINITY would trigger 99+% of total voting power in the NNS on all Governance proposals.  There would be no decentralization at all.  While this proposal enabled partial decentralization of the Governance topic, it also incentivized spam.

[Proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651): Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees
* 30.0 % YES - 3.3 % NO (DFINITY voted)
* exceeds the 2/3 majority relative to total votes cast
* does not exceed 2/3 majority relative to Total Voting Power
* If this proposal were not able to pass, we would have a "set and forget" condition where named neurons could hold permanent voting power from some of it's followers

[Proposal 70015](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70015): Tactical fix for spam
* 16.3% YES - 11.4% NO  (DFINITY abstained) 
* does not exceed 2/3 majority relative to total votes cast
* does not exceed 2/3 majority relative to Total Voting Power
* This proposal stopped spam.  If this proposal were not able to pass, we would still have 4 spam proposals every day.

[Proposal 80970](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970): Spam Prevention - Convert from system-based rewards to voter based rewards
* 49.4% YES - 0.4% NO  (DFINITY voted) 
* exceeds 2/3 majority relative to total votes cast
* does not exceed 2/3 majority relative to Total Voting Power
* This proposal exceeds your 33.4% threshold that you mentioned above, so your definition of super majority would not have caused it to fail. It is a major change to voting rewards distribution and will be implemented when DFINITY finishes developing and testing the code.
[quote="mechaquan, post:17, topic:17657, full:true"]
Should be 2/3rds of available voting power‚Ä¶so for example you‚Äôd need 33.4% of total available voting power to vote adopt in order to pass.

* This proposal exceeds your 33.4% threshold mentioned above, so your definition of super majority would not have caused it to fail.  It was a temperature check that included no actual tokenomic change proposal, but it triggered a lot of community debate and is not being pursued.

Good summary‚Ä¶I agree none of those would‚Äôve achieved 2/3rds of total voting power‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs kinda the point!

But we aren‚Äôt talking about retroactively changing anything but whether going forward we should protect against unnecessary changes by requiring more voting engagement.

The penultimate point here is that it would give people more confidence in staking if they knew it would be difficult to change tokenomics in the future‚Ä¶

Finally, I do hope Dfinity reconsider/deprioritize the spam prevention proposal since as you mentioned we already don‚Äôt have spam!

Do more research , show more numbers or you are just blabbering with wpb all the time . Wpb think way ahead of you . While you are just blindly throwing stuff that makes little sense. Hope this can stop. 

66.6% did any proposal passed that threshold before without dfinity voting ? If dfinity were to vote people will start to complain again.

I agree regarding [Proposal 80970 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970).  I would prefer that we re-evaluate the need for implementation of that proposal.

I don't agree regarding gatekeeping NNS Tokenomics changes with these impossibly high thresholds.  Tokenomics exist to incentivize participation in governance and is fundamental to decentralization for the IC.  Tokenomics changes should be hard and well considered, but they shouldn't be impossible and it should always be a decentralized decision.

I don‚Äôt see how this is gatekeeping at all‚Ä¶it‚Äôs ensuring the community is sufficiently engaged in order to get changes done and ensuring further decentralization from the current structure of Dfinity +3.

Also, I haven‚Äôt suggested a time frame for implementation so maybe it‚Äôs a future target as we strive to make these changes more challenging over time.

Start with 55% then 60% then 2/3rds over the next year or something‚Ä¶

I seriously don‚Äôt like the idea of only needing 2/3rds of 6% of the VP‚Ä¶I think this puts too much control with Dfinity.  

Think about how hard it would be to get to 2/3rds if Dfinity voted against?  You would need +45% of the voting power it would give them pretty much unlimited veto power on everything.

I fully trust Dfinity at this time but I think these checks and balances need to be in place to ensure they 1) need more than 3% to get things passed and 2) don‚Äôt have complete veto authority.

Again, as I mentioned to Austin‚Ä¶all this is considering that Dfinity can raise a code proposal vote on it and get 99% voting power!  So this would be a paper tiger check and balance until people stop following Dfinity on code changes but this is probably years away‚Ä¶

Maybe you need to do some research because Dfinity HAS voted on most of the recent governance proposals‚Ä¶as is their right‚Ä¶

No I don't. I'm a nobody . I don't have to impress anyone.
