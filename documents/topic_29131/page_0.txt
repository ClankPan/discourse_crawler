I have a rust backend canister adapted from https://github.com/dfinity/icp-eth-starter/tree/main

It simply calls an ethereum contract and returns some info. I have this working when calling from the candid UI, and also if calling from a frontend canister.

I switched to calling this canister from an http incall GET request (e.g. directly from postman), and am now receiving the error: `"ic0_call_cycles_add128" cannot be executed in non replicated query mode, error code Some("IC0504")`

What's confusing me is that my http_request method is defined as a composite query, so I'd expect this to be running in non replicated query mode already. indeed, if I run it as a vanilla query without defining as composite, I receive a different error that makes sense: `"ic0_call_new" cannot be executed in non replicated query mode, error code Some("IC0504")`

It seems to be triggered by this method from the ic-cdk `api/management_canister/http_request`:

```
pub async fn http_request(
    arg: CanisterHttpRequestArgument,
    cycles: u128,
) -> CallResult<(HttpResponse,)> {
    call_with_payment128(
        Principal::management_canister(),
        "http_request",
        (arg,),
        cycles,
    )
    .await
}
```

If you study the interface spec you can probably confirm this, but the error describes the problem.

You can't call that functionality from a query call, which http_request is. You'll need to do this from http_request_update assuming you're trying to create an HTTP canister
