Following the first workshop, I hope some ideas are sprouting for apps to build... I think there’s room for all kinds, both practical and fun, games, productivity etc.

To start, I think I’ll take a look at a simple app that does a little exploration of LinkedUp’s network graph (whether that’s fun or practical, I’ll let you decide!) It’ll make use of the idea that canisters can connect to and extend each other’s services.
