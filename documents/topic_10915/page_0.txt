Just noticed for the first time, Github now recognizes Motoko as a language in its per-repository language stats:

![motoko|327x298](upload://dB0W126MdRT5PdoE3FjuEk2lNxl.png)

Kudos for this goes to @quint who created [the PR against the linguist library used by Github](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/5611) last November. Which, incidentially, [broke the recognizion of Modelica code](https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/5692) and now the Modelica people have to [manually override](https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/pull/8346) the recognition.

It can no longer be denied that Motoko is disruptive technology!
