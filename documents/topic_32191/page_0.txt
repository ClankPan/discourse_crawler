I'm looking for the demo implementation for the new Verifiable Credential feature. I only found a Rust implementation and I'd like to ask if there is a Motoko implementation as well?

@rbole: Currently, only a rust implementation is available unfortunately. We're now consolidating all the tooling in [this repository](https://github.com/dfinity/verifiable-credentials-sdk).

Feel free to contribute a Motoko one though, we would be very happy about that. :-)

Thanks for the information. I attempted to start today, but honestly, it's quite challenging to follow the Rust example for me. Thatâ€™s why I was looking for a guideline to get started.
