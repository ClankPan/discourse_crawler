I am a refined gentleman. And like most gentlemen, I prefer to use Angular as the front-end for **my** decentralized applications. I know you say that you're using the Internet Computer, but are you really using the Internet Computer? 
https://github.com/JupiterM/angularmotoko.git

So Yeah- I am using Angular for my projects, and am sharing code so we don't reinvent stuff, ya know? This is a play-and-play solution for anyone wanting to try out Angular with Motoko. After 'npm install', run 'npm run deploy:local' and it at least comes up for me.  Easy to deploy on IC, just fill in 'canister_ids.json' with- you know. The 'greet' function returns in the console as a zone-aware promise. It is a 0.0.1 after all. I am adding state management for II. It is either going to be NGRX or Signals. Signals is in beta, so leaning more towards NGRX. 

Appreciation goes out to https://github.com/shawndotey -- https://samlinux.medium.com/angular-meets-internet-computer-d00abec0a95b -- https://github.com/samlinux/angularMeetsIc

From you I not only learned, but copy and pasted. Don't worry, I had to actually do some of my own work besides right-clicking.

Sir, I am also a gentleman respecting the league of angular and motoko. Allow me to add my 5 pence. Feel free to use standalone components and signals. This works great. [RxAngular](https://www.rx-angular.io/) is also a godsend for performance and has a good state manager. Don't forget to add `.dfx` to `.gitignore`

I say good sir, you caught me with my .dfx hanging out! Don't worry, it has been .gitignore'd, before further embarssement is to be caused; especially with a file as large as my .dfx!

Thanks for the RxAngular mention! I am rifling through its documentation section even as we speak!

Hi, have you tried your setup for Angular 17 and dfx 15.x ?

-------------------------

Jupes_M | 2023-12-01 04:38:41 UTC | #5

Yes: I am going to be updating this to reflect the latest versions. I will have something out soon. 

With Angular not receiving much love in Web3, my plan is to keep up two repos to make it easy for anyone wanting to try it for their dapps. The goal is to make it as plug-and-play as possible. 

1) Angular 'X' and Motoko. Base Angular and Motoko. Basic Front Page with Internet Identity integrated as a service. 

2) Easy Am I (Enterprise Angular Motoko Ionic). A more heavy-duty repo. With Landing Page, II login, Accounts and a Dashboard.

-------------------------

Very cool, 

Currently I work on my next course with Angular 17 as frontend and Motoko as backend canister to help developers in their transition from Web2 to a Web 3 developer.

Good sirs, I shall partake this league of refined gentlemen appreciating the wonders of Angular 17.

I dare say these custom webpack configurations are not so refined. I would be honored to share with you an Angular CLI plugin that can banish this ugliness to the node_modules black hole.

No promise is complete without anticipation, I would share this treasure later today, once I arrange my rabbits appropriately and would invite your honorable feedback.

-------------------------

rbole | 2023-12-05 06:19:16 UTC | #8

Hi, @NathanosDev do you have an update on your Angular CLI plugin as you have mentioned?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-12-05 10:35:00 UTC | #9

In progress... Extracting it from my private repo was more work than I predicted. I'll have it ready in the next days :)

-------------------------

rbole | 2024-02-07 16:40:24 UTC | #10

Hi @NathanosDev I wanted to ask quietly whether there has been any progress with Angular?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2024-02-07 18:56:45 UTC | #11

Yes! I've had some bugs I'm trying to sort out, specifically with the authentication side. So in general I would say it works, but is not production-ready yet. On the authentication side, you can log in and log out but you may encounter some weird things related to idling and expiration.

The repo is here: https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular
API docs are in a good state, but I haven't written any user guides yet: https://hadronous.github.io/ic-angular/
There is also an example project: https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular/tree/main/example

If you are fine to hack around with something that's still a WIP it would be awesome to have your feedback.

The files to focus on in the example are:
- [`angular.json`](https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular/blob/main/angular.json#L50)
- [`dfx.json`](https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular/blob/main/dfx.json#L21)
- [`package.json`](https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular/blob/main/example/frontend/package.json#L5-L6)
- [`environment.ts`](https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular/blob/main/example/frontend/src/environments/environment.ts)
- and then of course all of the [`src`](https://github.com/hadronous/ic-angular/tree/main/example/frontend/src) fles

Hi thanks for posting your great progress. It looks like your setup is not working on Mac OS, should I try this in an Ubuntu Docker Container ?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2024-02-08 11:04:36 UTC | #13

Sorry I didn't mention it, the packages are published to NPM:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hadronous/ic-angular
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hadronous/ic-build-angular

The instructions in the readme are for contributing to the project. I should add MacOS support for the system setup scripts, but you can also just follow those steps manually and translate them to the MacOS equivalent if you want to contribute to the repo, but basically you just need to install `fnm` (or a specific version of NodeJS), `pnpm`, commitizen and `dfx`.

-------------------------

rbole | 2024-02-09 08:59:33 UTC | #14

Thank you, your work is an inspiration.

To stay in line with the other starter kits out there I have published my approach to use Angular 17 on the Internet Computer.

Short update on this project.

I have published two branches:

- the main branch is **without** a custom-webpack-configuration and uses **esbuild**. It uses an prebuild script to rewrite the environment/environment.ts file for three different deployment methods (local, playground, ic)
- the second branch, called angular-ic-custom-webpack, **uses** a custom-webpack-configuration to read the **.env** file and a proxy config for all **/api** calls.

Both examples use **their own createActor function** implemented in an Angular service to not use the index.js file in src/declarations/backend/. Because this file is rewritten every time you generate new declarations (dfx generate backend).
