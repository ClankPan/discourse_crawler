What are the steps required to be performed before raising `registerDappCanisters` proposal for new canister which have not been registered with SNS previously?


I am uncertain about how the SNS can assume control over a new canister without having prior controller access. Do we nedd to add the SNS root canister or any other canister as the controller of the new canister before executing the proposal?

Hi @gravity_vi ,

You can find some infromation about this [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/7bad2fdce8af188fe84c6934df32cb87847c51e4/rs/sns/governance/proto/ic_sns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L391) in the definition where it says:
> The canisters must be already controlled by the SNS root canister before making this proposal. Any controllers besides the root canister will be removed when the proposal is executed. 

So I this means that if you want to add a canister to the SNS:
1. Add SNS root to its controllers.
2. Submit this proposal. You can find documentation on this step [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals#registerdappcanisters).

As always, it is of course advisable to test this first. 

I hope this helps!
