How to name neurons, I hope that IC supports naming their own neurons, at least when I follow an ordinary neuron, after I enter a string of numbers, it can display its name, which can reduce some mistakes. 

This is also the basis for community organizations to authenticate the possession of a certain neuron and other more advanced functions.
This function is not complicated, and the 28th neuron of ICA already supports this function.
