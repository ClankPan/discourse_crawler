ICP has around 2.5 million Internet Identifiers (IIs) created. Most of them were initially created for testing purposes and then abandoned. Some accounts are owned by the same person. Some claim the monthly active users are around 100,000, but I suspect the actual number of real users is much lower, perhaps only a few thousand. DecideAI might be able to reveal the real number. 

Let's be honest. The ICP ecosystem has a few hundred developers and a few thousand real users.

To use a metaphor, imagine technology on one side and users on the other, with 100 miles between them. ICP's technology is impressive, but unless DFINITY covers 99 miles, they'll only attract a few tech enthusiasts.

We can't expect the tech team to cover those 99 miles—it's up to the product team. So, how far has the product team actually gone? Given the current user base, I'd say only about 10 miles. How do I estimate that? Show every product to your grandma—can you teach her to use it within a minute? If not, improve it. Nowadays, web3 users are extremely busy with countless projects, blockchains, airdrops, and more demanding their attention. To succeed, focus on making things easier for these busy users. If they give you a minute, strive to keep them with simple, user-friendly products.

You can't blame the users, the product team, or the tech team. The C-level executives at DFINITY need to change their mindset. Simply believing "my tech is the best, so users will come" is too naive.

Another misconception is that ICP isn't just limited to crypto, FUD, or meme coins. ICP aims to serve large enterprises, governments, and revolutionize the entire IT stack. It's a grand vision. However, the initial focus should be on acquiring users. No government or enterprise will adopt your blockchain if it has only a few users. They'll look at platforms like Solana, TON, or Ethereum with millions of daily active users.

pls do not take the above as criticisms. it is only to initiate some discussions. feel free to dump your thoughts on how to acquire millions of real users on ICP.

There is no spark when all you are is a internet computer to provide others to build on for user interest or spark active users. When was the last time you heard the phrase I am excited to use Google.

Those will choose UTOPIA as no governments or enterprises will build on any public blockchain anytime soon.

The outcome of crypto is still unclear to me. All I know is that I'd rather place my hopes on a project that isn't a mere token database. And I say that while currently developing my own app on ICP.

I agree with you that the team behind ICP seemed to think that having the best tech would automatically attract users.  In some cases that can happen, but a project should definitely do more to get users than just relying on the quality of tech.  I think Dfinity is improving that by partnering with all of these accelerator programs like [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io/base-camp/#:~:text=Outlier%20Ventures%20is%20a%20venture,every%20stage%20of%20their%20development.) (who is also partnered with Near Protocol).

When people make a fuss about the amount of users, I think what they are really after here is probably price action.  Would we really care about the number of users when ICP's price is $700 or more per token?  I'm willing to bet we wouldn't.  And that leads to my next points.

I honestly think the number of active users is overrated.  One, I think most or all of the points you mentioned about people having multiple accounts, fakes, etc can apply just as easily to other blockchain projects, as well.  I'll believe otherwise once everyone goes though ICP's proof of humanity feature.  Secondly, and most importantly, I think the quality of users can also matter to a project.  If we get one or two big players, then that can bring on just as much adoption and price action compared to a lot of users who only spend and contribute little.  Bitcoin did not shoot up until the big players got involved.  Even with that, there is really no significant adoption of any crypto project, other than Bitcoin (it's being used by 2 or 3 countries, at the moment).  So having lots of users by itself is not enough, and I'd argue there are alternatives to getting adoption or at least getting the big players involved.  Hopefully, we can get some ideas in this discussion.

I think random people should stop posting what Dfinity should or should not do.

I also think Dfinity is having the best approach possible focusing on the tech and letting organic growth reward naturally early adopters instead of artificial heavy marketing solely focused on users growth.

Dev using the ICP network ARE the one that should be focused on marketing.

I think you should stop telling random ppl what to do and what not. 

Dfinity has the best approach so it already has so many users right? 

Devs should focus on marketing so dfinity should dismiss its marketing team and focus on tech, right? smart ass

from the words you use, i suspect you are one of the c level executives. 
random ppl: ppl who hold and stake ICP are random ppl. only dfinity ppl are not random?
best approach possible: wow!
dev should focus on marketing: I think random ppl should stop posting what devs should do?

**Web3Gal**,

Be nice!

I think Dfinity is starting to focus more on marketing although their focus started late in the game. But they are ramping it up now.

I think it will take a combination of good tech (stuff that's in-demand) and marketing to onboard many more users.  Dominic has talked about using Ai proof of humanity program to verify people's identity and that could allow their Decentralized exchanges (like ICPswap) to offer securities, like Tesla stocks, etc.  That could bring in a lot of people.  Also, having a Decentralized YouTube would also bring in a lot of users.



What do you think Solana or other projects have done to get users that ICP is not doing?  Spending more on marketing?  Better defi?  I've read Polygon spent a lot on marketing and they didn't get the results that they were wanting.  So this has to be good marketing as well and not just throwing money towards anything to get your name out there. 

On Polygon's marketing:

> In early 2022, Polygon Labs [announced](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-welcomes-nasdaq-listed-draftkings-as-network-validator) an “important adoption milestone” for its tech infrastructure: DraftKings would begin running one of its network validators, “marking the first time a major publicly-traded firm has taken an active role in blockchain governance.”
>
>
>
> What Polygon neglected to disclose at the time: It would allow the sports-betting company to do this job on unusually lucrative and favorable terms.
>
>
>
> **Twenty months later, Polygon has foregone millions subsidizing a validator that’s gone kaput.**
>
>
>
> It’s not unheard of for Web3 companies to pay mainstream brands to take part in their crypto ecosystems, be it through marketing partnerships or tech setups. But they balk at publicly discussing the treasure they spend to build this image of mainstream adoption. The on-chain data showing Polygon’s special treatment of DraftKings provides a rare window into such an arrangement.

Here is a list of ways that I think Dfinity is improving on getting their name (or ICP) out there:

1. Getting more exposure and integration on CoinMarketCap.  For instance, [Dominic interview w/ Gabriel Zani](https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1795085676037525535), an operations manager for CoinMarketCap.  We are also showing up more on their data, like [ICP being #1 in Depin](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/depin/) category on CMC.

2. Having one or two accelerator programs, like the [partnership with Outlier Ventures](https://x.com/dfinity/status/1795455394648600994)

3. Having more articles published in some of the leading crypto media, like CoinTelegraph, TheBlock, etc.  Just news about UTOPIA was reported on multiple outlets, [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/667d554770bb0e1ab4db899d/), [CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dfinity-icp-powered-cybersecurity-platform-launch), [MorningStar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20240627ln50278/utopia-reinvents-enterprise-compute-to-solve-cybersecurity-challenges-and-address-the-10-trillion-dollar-cybercrime-problem), [PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/utopia-reinvents-enterprise-compute-to-solve-cybersecurity-challenges-and-address-the-10-trillion-dollar-cybercrime-problem-302184502.html), etc.

4. Integration with [DappRadar](https://x.com/dfinity/status/1806447426624200722).

Also, noticed Dfinity being more active on Twitter always posting about events and updates, Dominic attending multiple crypto-related events, etc.  I can go on and on.

I think one issue is that people automatically assume that ICP is lacking in marketing based on the relatively low amount of users (compared to Solana?).  Or perhaps the issue is that because the lack of marketing was true at one point, people still think that is the case.  But if you stay up-to-date by continuing to look up ICP's presence over the internet, keep track of their social media posts, then you should notice that Dfinity/ICP is doing a better job at getting their name out there.
