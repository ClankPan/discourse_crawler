BitBasel Marketplace Project Presentation

Project Highlights

BitBasel's Marketplace is a groundbreaking platform designed to revolutionize the digital art world. Specifically targeting artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts, the marketplace addresses the need for a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for buying, selling, and trading digital art. By leveraging blockchain technology, BitBasel ensures authenticity and ownership, providing a unique value proposition to the art community.

Web3 Advantages

Unlike traditional Web2 art marketplaces, BitBasel utilizes the decentralized nature of blockchain to offer enhanced security and transparency. This approach eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and provides artists with greater control over their work. The decentralized nature of BitBasel contrasts sharply with centralized Web2 platforms, offering a more democratic and equitable ecosystem for digital art transactions.

How is it Built

The BitBasel Marketplace is constructed using a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including leveraging the the ICP canisters built by the team at Bioniq. Artwork is minted on the Bitcoin Ordinal protocol, wrapped using ICPs BTC Canister, and able to be bought & sold through listing or auction leveraging ckBTC.  The project utilizes a modular architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility. The use of these technologies not only ensures robust performance but also aligns with the decentralized ethos of the platform.

Internet Computer Superpowers

The use of the Internet Computer's unique features has significantly enhanced the BitBasel Marketplace. It's integration with BTC allow our artists to leverage the Ordinal Protocol for creating a secure provenance for their work, while maintaing the speed and low transaction costs of the IC.

Go-To-Market Strategy

Our strategy to attract users involves partnerships with renowned artists and art institutions, social media campaigns, and engagement with art communities. Collaborations with art influencers and participation in art fairs and exhibitions are also key components of our user acquisition strategy.

Monetization

BitBasel Marketplace is designed as a profit-oriented platform, with revenue generated through transaction fees, premium listings, and promotional features for artists. 

Status of the Project

Currently, the BitBasel Marketplace is in its advanced development stage, with core functionalities implemented and undergoing testing. We have already established partnerships with several artists and art collectives and are in the process of building our user base.

This GitHub link does not appear to work. Is the repo still closed source maybe?

The BitBasel team did decide to close source the application. They are continuing to work on the UX and will have plans to open source once they develop a monetization strategy.

I know that the BitBasel team is utilizing Boniq APIs. @bob11 do you have any plans to create SDK? 

If not in the near future, I also think that an API guide and documentation would be really helpful to developers.

Open source SDK is the way to go. The BitBasel team has done a lot of work in this direction and they already have a good start here.
