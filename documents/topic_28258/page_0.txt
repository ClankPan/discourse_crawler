I've been searching for ICDex swap transactions but have been unable to locate all the swap entries. Take, for instance, the ITest/DTest pair. On [this page](https://ic.house/swap/xjazg-fiaaa-aaaar-qacrq-cai), it indicates a total swap count of 39,671. However, only 1000 swap entries are displayed, with no apparent option to view older entries.

I've attempted to retrieve older swap entries by checking the `drc205_events` endpoint from their canister, but it seems to be ineffective. Could you provide insight into where ICDex stores its old data and how to query it, either through the canister or the UI?
