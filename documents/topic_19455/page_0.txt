This is a Rust issue. Most likely your toolchain version is too old for the default `dfx deploy`. You could either bump your Rust version, or use a custom canister where you set up your own build script

Hey i got it working , actually the rust docs in https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/rust-quickstart , was miss leading , because in Before you begin section ,point 2  it said ```The Rust tool chain must be at version 1.46.0, or later.``` , i think you guys should change or update that . because the latest stable toolchain worked fine . while i was beating my head to make it work with a 1.46.0 version of it.
