Since the Zed editor is gaining attention among developers, we should consider adding an extension for Zed to the Motoko roadmap.

Thank you for letting us know! What do you like about Zed more than VSCode?

I also am a fan of Zed!

It's very lightweight, written in Rust. So, if I'm coding on my old personal laptop, it's nice to not dedicate so many resources to my editor while I'm running other processes. 

Most importantly, the fact that it's [open-source](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) and community driven makes it a nice alternative to VSCode, which is owned by Microsoft and is becoming more and more coupled with the rest of their suite of products over time

Nice to learn more! I am wondering if a Zed extension is something a grantee could pick up if theyâ€™d like to.

Yeah Zed is great!. I love how they incorporated the AI features too. I now switch between doing UI work in Zed and Motoko work in VSCode, but Zed seems like a great tool to support.
