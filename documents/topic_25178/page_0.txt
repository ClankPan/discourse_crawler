I enabled automatic stake new maturity on NNS, I can see the staked maturity increased, but the total ICP of neuron have never changed, so where those maturity go? and how to unstake them?

Your maturity is staked based on your description.  It will not be minted until you fully dissolve and disperse the full stake of ICP in your neuron.  However, staked maturity adds voting power to your neuron, which means your voting rewards are going up because you are compounding your rewards.  When you are ready to harvest rewards from your governance participation, then you can stop staking maturity automatically and allow it to accumulate.  Any time you have more than 1.05 maturity,  you can spawn a neuron to liquidate that maturity as ICP.
