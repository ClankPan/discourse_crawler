What type of topic is this?  
Discussion

I Am using Python ic-py module library to fetch/source neuron's data using get_neuron method(sns) 
`governance = Canister(agent=agent, canister_id=id, candid=governance_did)
governance.get_neuron(
    {
        'neuron_id': id
    }
)`

how do i pass the neuron id ?? is there some link or doc's that i can refer to ?

I would suggest that you double-check the [Governance canister Candid file](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/governance/canister/governance.did) to get the list of available functions. 

Could you confirm which function you are trying to use? `get_neuron` is not an exposed function. 

Though I am not as familiar with ic-py as @ccyanxyz, they do provide an example in the [`ic-py` README](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py?tab=readme-ov-file#6-canister) for the `list_proposals` function:

```
from ic.canister import Canister
from ic.client import Client
from ic.identity import Identity
from ic.agent import Agent
from ic.candid import Types

iden = Identity()
client = Client()
agent = Agent(iden, client)
# read governance candid from file
governance_did = open("governance.did").read()
# create a governance canister instance
governance = Canister(agent=agent, canister_id="rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai", candid=governance_did)
# call canister method with instance
res = governance.list_proposals(
    {
        'include_reward_status': [],
        'before_proposal': [],
        'limit': 100,
        'exclude_topic': [],
        'include_status': [1]
    }
)
```
which corresponds to the type provided by the Governance Candid file:


```
list_proposals : (ListProposalInfo) -> (ListProposalInfoResponse) query;

type ListProposalInfo = record {
  include_reward_status : vec int32;
  omit_large_fields : opt bool;
  before_proposal : opt NeuronId;
  limit : nat32;
  exclude_topic : vec int32;
  include_all_manage_neuron_proposals : opt bool;
  include_status : vec int32;
};
```
Based on the example that you provided, I am assuming that you probably are going something with the NeuronID which should be a record with an id of a nat64. `type NeuronId = record { id : nat64 };` However, it would be great if you could double check the function that you are trying to use.

Hope this helps! Please let us know if any more questions.
