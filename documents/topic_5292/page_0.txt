Hey folks, anyone with frontend skills looking for a way to contribute to the community? I just got a proof of concept RRS feed for the NNS bootstrapped. It uses a Gatsby site with an RSS feed plugin, and the current strategy to refresh and publish the content would be to trigger a Netlify redeploy using a webhook called from Zapier or something. 

This demonstrates how any app can use an existing open API from a canister like the NNS and provide alternatives to Dfinity Foundation applications like the NNS App. 

Code lives here: https://github.com/krpeacock/nns-feed

and you can view the current frontend at https://60cb9ef6014df611fc7fba14--serene-minsky-dca73c.netlify.app/
