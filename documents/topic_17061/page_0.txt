think useful way to adjust tokenomics schedule. it release neary 40,000,000 tokens every year. so terrible, I never see a token like this. they are all search deflation.

This number will continue to go down every year until it reaches 5%. Polkadot and avalanche are much higher.

Unfortunately the high number of ICP token issuance seems to be put in place to subsidize the DFINITY team members. We are paying for their R&D, etc... if you are investing in ICP and expecting a substantial return on investment,  I don't think the payoff will happen if you paid over $6, not with up to 400 million tokens issued in the full run.

Dot has limited numbers 1 billon, Eth has already in deflation road. Even 5% inflation every year is 25,000,000. Have u calculated how much cycles burned per second can eliminate that huge inflation? It needs Nearly 350x times than now even at the price 4$. Dfinity fund already has huge returns. They can’t make money at the expense of huge inflation. One way to solve this is to set per unit cycles from 1000 billions to 3 billions. Increase the cost of cycle burns.

Polk dot and avalanches has constant total number ! Dfinity has no limit of total number according to huge inflation. It will reach 1 billion in ten years. Have u ever seen any token can reach 100$ if it’s total number is 1 billion?

[quote="Jarred-Sauce, post:6, topic:17061"]
This decreases the circulating supply substantially. ICP is also being burned and that amount will increase as dapps and users increase and consume more cycles.

Relying on staking for deflation is dangerous and could become a ticking bomb. The number of tokens burned increases with usage but also decrease as price appreciates. If you are interested you can read more about it here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/can-the-ic-become-deflationary/16125

It’ll go down overtime. The solution is for more developers to build on the internet computer and for more users to participate, driving up the burn rate.

-------------------------

Inch_Deen | 2022-12-05 17:31:30 UTC | #11

No hope for that. It needs 400x times cycles burn than now, how it can be possible? Only way to solve this problem is to decrease XDR from 1000 billions cycles to 2.5-3 billions!

Problem is how much burn rate has to increase to create deflation is related to icp price. That is cause dApps pay for computation in XDR and as token price goes up less tokens must be burned for the same XDR amount but inflation is determined by % of total supply.

Infinite growth is impossible so there is a price range after which the IC can't be deflationary with current tokenomics, what that price is nobody knows yet.

-------------------------

Inch_Deen | 2022-12-05 17:51:48 UTC | #13

Yes. It needs to adjust according to the price to eliminate inflation. From the situation since start, I cannot any hope in the future for ICP is inflation still continued.

Most likely cause they rely on staking to act as a deflationary mechanism, but I don't agree with that conclusion.

Sure there is. It’s built to handle a lot more than it does now. We could see cycle consumption increase substantially, and even without that we know that plenty of inflationary coins see large price increases despite inflation.

@Inch_Deen Can you please rephrase your thread title to NOT have the "infinite huge inflation" phrasing which is technically wrong, but most importantly it is misleading? 

People are actively engaging with your thoughts and beliefs as good actors. So renaming would go a long way towards a civil discussion without hyperbole.

*After all, effective minting rate is currently 3.7%... does this sound like a big problem in great scheme of things?*

To be honest, I do not understand your comments in this thread and others. I am willing to concede there may be some typing or language issues, so just take it as honest feedback:

* I honestly believe whatever point you are trying to make is NOT coming through
* i honestly believe staking + node provider minting rate is a secondary issue considering the effective numbers. You may have a point in what the *perception of the minting rate* is, which people think is high (but is not), and a false narrative which ironically your post further espouses.

Again, I am asking you to please change the title on this thread to something less inflammatory or I will lock the thread. It is my role to have non-reactionary, non-inflammatory dialogues.

1. To reiterate, I did not say anything about banning, only locking the thread so you can iterate and try creating a fresh one with the feedback. 

2. This new post by you (with new user account) actually does not signal much intent to have a constructive dialogue. This is the first time I considered banning the previous account. And while the totality of comments you have made is not really helpful or constructive… it was not until this moment right now that I wondered if you have have troll-ish intent. Please prove my suspicions wrong by acting in good faith (repeating same accusations and not listening to people and using hyperbolic language is not acting in good faith).
