Hello there,

I was wondering if `dfx` supports some verbose options that allow to stream/output all the function calls internally (incl. procedure calls)?

This would be used during the development process. Helpful to generate call graphs and demonstrate multi-canisters architectures.

My goal is to be able to generate a sequence diagram of a canister call, which would include internal functions and external canister calls. 

An example: https://github.com/naddison36/tx2uml#ethereum-transaction-to-uml-sequence-diagram-generator

---

With a stream, I could pipe the data so that a webpage will display in real-time some functions calls via d3.js:  node groups would represent canisters, each node will represent the public/private functions. ( generated from candid + need to export private functions)

Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have much in that direction yet. The emulator environment (`dfx start --emulator`) is what we hope will help with such things, at least when you run things locally. But it will take a while.
