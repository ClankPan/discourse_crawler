Hi, I'm unable to get the motoko code completion to work in my configuration.
I am using VSCode on Windows with the Motoko plugin and through WSL.
The autocomplete works fine for my frontend in javascript, but refuses to behave properly in my motoko backend.
There doesn't seem to be any relevant errors in my Motoko Language Server logs.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
