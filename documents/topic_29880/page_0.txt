What you're looking is the `AddNeuronPermission` command. Permissions work differently on the SNS, permissions are more fine grained. The one you need is likely `NEURON_PERMISSION_TYPE_VOTE`  from the [protobuf file](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/bc70bfd1954df31400cada1444f4a448970b4f59/rs/sns/governance/proto/ic_sns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L12).

I found that nns-dapp has `RemoveHotKey` and `AddHotKey` in `Operation` field from this [Github links](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/d873d45738dd8033e0b2948228274f7da334ef56/declarations/nns_governance/nns_governance.did#L458). So there is any different from the candid in dashboard page?

You are referring the the NNS governance canister, that one has `AddHotKey` and `RemoveHotKey`. The SNS governance canister has `AddNeuronPermission`.
