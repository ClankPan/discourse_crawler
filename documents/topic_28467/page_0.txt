Hi, what would it take to add a section for non-SNS tokens to the NNS wallet?

Since the NNS is pretty much the main wallet everyone uses to safe keep their ICP and SNS tokens, I think it would be a good idea to add another section to it that allows users to import any ICRC-2 token.

This could enable a plethora of new use cases, such as airdropping tokens to 8 years neuron holders, etc.

I've also always wanted to hold my OGY directly in the NNS, but right now it's not possible.

Let me know your thoughts!
