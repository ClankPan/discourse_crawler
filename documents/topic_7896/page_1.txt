Hi @xiaobing , 

Here's the memo that summarized what happened. Apologize for the long wait and appreciate your patience.

**Executive Summary**

This memo follows up to the original post titled “[My NNS has been stolen, Please help me](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/my-nns-has-been-stolen-please-help-me/7896)” , that first appeared on Oct 14, 2021 at [DFINITY’s official forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/) by user @xiaobing  (hereafter referred to as “**OP**”) . It’s gathered 99 replies with 1.6K views involving 17 forum users as of Dec 14, 2021, and has caused a lot of anxiety and question marks from the IC community regarding the security measures of the NNS. OP is now planning to submit an NNS proposal to regain access to the neuron he used to own, which has staked 32,000 ICPs for 8 years. This planned proposal, if successfully submitted by OP and adopted by the community, will be the first of its kind for the IC ecosystem, setting up a precedent where the owner of a stolen account tries to recover through decentralized governance. It is drawing a lot of interest and attention from the community. This memo shares the efforts by the DFINITY team to help OP gather facts and the investigation findings from the DFINITY engineering team. It aims to shed some light on the possible causes of this incident. In short, the result from DFINITY’s investigation suggested that:

1. This was not caused by any bug in the Internet Computer/ Network Nervous System
2. OP’s computer was most likely hacked and the hacker very likely had physical access to his laptop and Yubi-key

**1/ The Stake**

OP lost access to his Internet Identity (“II”) account **171674**, which has staked **32,000** ICPs in one single neuron for 8 years on the [NNS](https://nns.ic0.app/) (as of Oct 2021 this was valued at roughly $1.5M). Based on third party explorer [ic.rocks](https://ic.rocks/) and the principle ID OP still keeps, the ICPs are still intact in this neuron - so regardless who now takes control of this neuron, the ICPs locked up in the neuron have not and will not move in the next 7+ years. OP has currently no access to the neuron and it’s not clear who is the current owner.

**2/ The History**

OP registered this II account in July. He bought 2 Yubikeys, directly from [yubico.com](https://www.yubico.com/). Yubikey is not available in China, so OP had the Yubikeys shipped to Hong Kong and asked a friend to bring them into China. Both Yubikeys are of the same model (likely to be 5C Nano) that can be directly plugged into a laptop.

OP used 3 methods to access this II account including 2 Yubikeys and 1 seed phrase. He used a digital camera (not a cell phone) to take a photo of the seed phrase and hand-wrote it down on a piece of paper. This piece of paper was locked up in a safe.

OP accessed this II account on 4 machines (2 Windows and 2 Macs). There were two known users who had access to this II account, OP and the manager he worked for (hereafter referred to as “**BOSS**”). BOSS is the owner of the company, which has a portfolio of crypto tokens and employs a small team of engineers. It’s beyond the capability of DFINITY to differentiate which specific action was carried out by OP vs BOSS. This memo would assume by default OP was the one that executed all activities mentioned, though in reality OP and BOSS might be the owner of different actions.

On a Friday in August (hereafter referred to as “Incident Day”), all of a sudden OP’s Yubikey no longer worked. OP tried the other Yubikey and the seed phrase. None of them worked. His last successful login was about 2-3 days prior to the Incident Day, on one of the Macs. OP went to DFINITY’s official forum and created the original post on Oct 14.

Initially the NNS could still recognize the II account 171674 and prompted him to use the Yubikey/seed phrase. At some point later, OP found that the error message on NNS had changed. NNS could no longer recognize this II account and would just say “Unknown Identity Anchor” without even prompting him for inserting Yubikey. It seems that whoever is now controlling this neuron has removed all the 4 devices that OP used and also changed the seed phrase.

**3/ The Investigation**

@Fulco , Support Specialist from DFINITY, tried to help out OP on the forum and maintained a continuous dialogue to help him find recovery solutions. Fulco even created a custom-made script to help him verify the account details. Many other engineers and leaders in DFINITY’s R&D team have been involved behind the scene that led to the eventual conclusion of the investigation.

@zire (Herbert) , Director of China Operations for DFINITY, reached out to OP to help. A first phone call between Herbert and OP took place on Oct 20, 2021 where basic facts were gathered and a meeting was arranged in Shanghai for Oct 28, 2021 in DFINITY’s local office. OP and BOSS traveled to Shanghai and attended the meeting with Herbert in person. @PaulLiu , Staff Engineer from DFINITY’s R&D team, dialed in via Zoom from the US.

In this first Zoom call (that involved both OP and BOSS), many scattered details mentioned above were confirmed. Additional details worth noting are: 1) OP and BOSS took comprehensive security measures around their office. They appeared pretty tech savvy in terms of handling crypto assets. 2) There was another incident of losing crypto tokens at the end of 2020 in the same office, for a different coin. Based on the description of OP and BOSS, it appeared that the account was not secure in the first place before being given to them. They were using a hardware wallet, but the wallet short-cuited. On the next day the tokens got moved to a Binance account and they couldn’t get it back. Paul pointed out that it might not be caused by a hardware malfunction but sounded like hacking by an insider.

Herbert/Paul let OP/BOSS know that DFINITY would escalate this issue internally and try to deploy engineering resources to see if we could recover the II account’s operation histories from block backups. There could be 3 possible outcomes from this analysis:

* Case A. It shows that their recovery key never matched anything;
* Case B. It shows that their recovery key matched something in the history but later there wasn’t any operation to remove it and somehow it just ended up like this with no more access for OP;
* Case C. It shows that their recovery key matched some record in the history, but later it was replaced.

Case A would call OP/BOSS’ credibility into question out right; Case B would suggest a potential bug in the NNS; and Case C would suggest that, somebody hacked the account, either knowingly or unknowingly, and this person could be just anyone, as far as DFINITY can tell.

During the following few weeks, DFINITY engineers analyzed the history of transactions on the blockchain to understand all changes related to OP's identity anchor. The conclusion is:

* On Jul 12, an initial recovery phrase was added, as was a second web authentication device “Tiger-backup”.
* Both the initial device and “Tiger-backup” were used frequently until Jul 26.
* On Jul 26, “Tiger-backup” was used to delete the existing recovery phrase and replace it by a new one.
* Both the initial device and “Tiger-backup” were used frequently until Aug 14.
* On Aug 14, the new recovery phrase was used to remove both the initial device and “Tiger-backup”. A new recovery key was also added.
* Since then, there were three sequences of transactions: 1) the recovery phrase was used to add a new device; 2) the new device was used to log into the NNS frontend dapp; 3) the new device was removed right after. The last transaction occurred on Oct 27.

It could be established that:

* Someone is still controlling the II account. There is no data that can pinpoint who that person is.
* The current owner uses the new recovery phrase.
* The new recovery phrase was added from the device “Tiger-backup”
* **Case C** (from the above) is what happened

On Nov 11, a second Zoom call was arranged among Herbert, Paul, OP and BOSS. All joined the call remotely from their respective offices.

Paul shared the investigation result from the engineering team and let them know that both Case A and B were categorically eliminated. Paul also pointed out that it was highly probable that the person would have physical access to both the laptop AND the Yubikey. Paul/Herbert also highlighted to OP/BOSS that beyond this point, there was nothing more DFINITY, as a technology contributor to the IC ecosystem, could further do to verify who is the rightful owner. Though OP/BOSS would very much want to provide all the paperwork to prove their identities, legitimacy and even transaction history, playing the role of courtroom judge is beyond the scope and responsibility of DFINITY. The NNS is not a court of law and more importantly, DFINITY is not a judge.

OP/BOSS agreed with the result and suggested that this account might be stolen by an insider who used to work for the company. OP/BOSS said they would go back to check the video surveillance. In the meanwhile, OP/BOSS still want to submit an NNS proposal to recover their account. If OP/BOSS can gather enough votes in favor of this proposal, technically speaking this is not entirely impossible. Herbert/Paul also pointed out that, while DFINITY would be happy to provide general technical guidance to OP/BOSS, if the same assistance will be provided to all other IC users fair and square, it cannot be involved in drafting this proposal per se. The proposal would have to be written and submitted by the ICP holder him/herself, not the DFINITY Foundation.

Thank you for reading this long memo. Appreciate your attention to this matter and all the suggestions so far.

Wow, this is some serious work.

 I want to say thank you to @PaulLiu, @zire and to the dfinity team for the gathering of these facts. It shows a great care that the dfinity team has taken on this matter. 

@zire Thanks for the write-up and for the specifics. I have one question so far, you mentioned that: 
[quote="zire, post:105, topic:7896"]

How is it possible that the II account 171674 was not able to be recognized by the II-service ? Is it possible to change or delete an identity-anchor?

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 01:44:30 UTC | #107

Thanks again to @zire, @PaulLiu  and the folks at Dfinity for working so hard to help me out.

I'm going to publish my evidence here, and sometime in the next few days, I'm going to propose a proposal that says, "Reset the mnemonic of the Internet identity anchor number 171674, neuron ID 9957861823581357722 back to the beginning

No problem @levi . We owe this to @xiaobing and the community to help him find out what happened. 

The anchor 171674 can still be recognized by the II-service/NNS. It's still there, along with the neuron and the ICPs in it. It's just that the devices owned by @xiaobing can no longer be recognized because the current owner has apparently removed them.

First of all, I feel empathy for the OP

This sounds like an issue that should be addressed by the local authorities, e.g., police, instead of the IC community. Is there any evidence of who the thief is? Did the video surveillance catch the face? Did the ICPs belong to OP or OP's company? Was there any related content in the suspect's employment contract? There are many legal nuances here and I don't think IC community is appropriate to make the decision.

If OP's proposal is passed, what will the community do if more similar cases pop up in the future?

Again, I feel empathy for the OP, but I will vote no. I encourage OP to gather as much as evidence and go to police or find a lawyer

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 06:35:54 UTC | #117

Thanks for your suggestion. I'll send it as soon as I've sorted it out

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 06:37:42 UTC | #118

The proposal is our best hope at this point, but unfortunately there's no valuable information from the surveillance video, so we can't identify the suspect

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-15 06:54:06 UTC | #119

Just collecting some facts.

July 26 seems to be a pivotal date. On July 26 , someone(say PARTYA) , using "tiger back up", changed the recovery phrase. That someone, I presume , was NOT OP.  (OP to confirm) 

The loss of access was not effective on July 26; but on or around August 14. Is that correct?

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 06:57:53 UTC | #120

7.26 Modified the mnemonic, 8.14 deleted the previous login device

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2021-12-15 07:04:46 UTC | #121

Now I fully understand the reason why you lost your account. And I am sorry to see what happened.

Truth be told, I would suggest you and your company must try your best to find the thief first, with the help of the company or maybe the police rather than ask the community. You must know that in this crypto world, seed phrase means everything, if you lost it, you don't have a chance to get it back, if so, many ppl may lost faith on this token and may cause many issues. As per many ICP holders' opinions (Almost everyone I talked with), this kind of things should not be made decision by the IC community.

Spend more time on catch the thief maybe a better choice.

These evidences can also be produced by Binance Exchange. If they are allowed to be retrieved in this way, the entire secondary market will be in danger.  Imagine what would happen if the exchange cooperated with the local government to commit evil

Dfinity is saying that it is technically possible; if enough votes go through. Therefore we must rationally explore that possibility,  in my opinion.

tcpim | 2021-12-15 07:31:47 UTC | #130

Hi @xiaobing, no intent to hurt your feelings but I feel I have the obligation as an ICP staker to express my thoughts below for the best interest of IC...

1. IC community should NOT act as a court...

This is a civil case or a criminal case if it's corp's property (I am not a lawyer). IC community should NOT and can NOT make the decision based on any form of evidence. 

Could it be the case that OP and the "suspect" agreed on transferring the neuron, but later OP and Boss regret and ask Dfinity to get it back without letting the "suspect" know? You think this is ridiculous? I do too! But the point here is that we the community don't have the knowledge or the right to make any call on this. Just call out some legal nuances here...do we know the relation between OP and the "suspect" outside of work? What could be the motivation of the suspect? Was there any conflict that happened before between OP and suspect? Was there any unfair or fair content in suspect's employment contract? This could be very complicated in the legal space and IC community should always stay out of this

2. This will be a bad start if the proposal passes...

Let's say OP's proposal passes. Next month, there is another case with much stronger evidence and we found there was a loophole in OP's evidence. Do we revoke this? Or, let's say OP's proposal is rejected and there is a new case with weaker evidence but gets passed. Do we bring OP's case back and approve it? 

With more stakers coming in, this might happen every once a month. Does the Difinity allocate resource for every case and we vote on every case? I can imagine lots of bad actors laughing behind the scenes if lots of proposals like this pass...

3. I DO want to help OP

Here are some resources I find online which seem promising...
https://www.scxsls.com/tlfvideo/337
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/361874817

I highly encourage you find a lawyer ASAP to at least know the possibility to go the legal path

@xiaobing I apologize if I hurt your feeling by saying things above, but I need to let the community hear my thoughts to avoid any potential trouble for the community.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-15 07:45:10 UTC | #131

So the very fact that this has to be played out all by itself is kind of sad. An alternate design of internet identity implementation might have been able to prevent this. But that is water under the bridge.

That said, I think that @xiaobing is going to go through the proposal route. Also Dfinity has stated it is not technically impossible to do what @xiaobing is asking to be done.

You're right in the sense that next month someone might come back with stronger evidence,  weaker evidence whatever. The ability to make proposals is ever present. So we should figure out now as to how to consider these types of cases as a community; not just to disregard carte-blanche, imo.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 07:49:53 UTC | #132

It doesn't matter, everyone can have their own opinion. Let me answer your first question: it is well known that the decentralization of virtual currency in today's society makes it very difficult to collect stolen assets, which is why we see news of stolen coins every few days, and I'm sure you also see it frequently. We didn't see anything of value on the surveillance video, so the proposal was our only hope;

Second question: I can add locking the account for three months or half a year in the proposal, so as to better distinguish whether what I have stated is true or not. If there is any objection, for example, we have sold the account, then the buyer can submit evidence of buying our account.

Third: the police can't help us find the thief, and the community has rejected our proposal, so what other way can I get my property back? At least at this point, the evidence is that I own the account, so I hope you can back me up.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 07:54:28 UTC | #133

This is an account with 32000ICP pledged. If there is a buyer, I believe he must have evidence.

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 08:00:53 UTC | #135

Binance customer service can log in my account, but they can't know my original mnemonic. My appeal is to restore the mnemonic when I created it

-------------------------

ysyms | 2021-12-15 08:18:21 UTC | #137

If I have to change my help, it should be that it has been leaked or in danger. If the person who gets my historical joy word can restore the account through the screenshot of the exchange, it is very dangerous. Even if you can prove that the currency account is you, you can't prove that the controller of the Internet identity is you, I don't want to help you find it, but this process has a lot of security issues.
如果我要改我的助记词那么应该是它已经泄漏了或处在危险之中。如果那个得到我的历史助记词的人可以通过交易所的截图来恢复账户，这是非常危险的。即便是你可以证明币安账户属于你，也不能证明那个互联网身份的控制者是你，我并不是不想帮你找回，而是这个流程有很大的安全问题。

The evidence I have now:

1: Screenshot of Binance's transfer; (We can also provide mobile phone screen recording if necessary)

2: Neuron ID can be seen in the screenshot of neuron page;

3:171674 initial mnemonic, approved by Dfinity (the tool they provided I used the public key generated by the mnemonic in my hand to match 171674);

4: Two yubikeys "Tiger" and "tiger-backup", Tiger is my boss's name

其实报警这个如果有用的话，早就报警了 我们的监控视频没有找到有用的信息，这个事情找警察也没有用  因为去中心化的东西如果没有监控你根本就没有办法找到小偷的

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-12-15 11:44:06 UTC | #144

Besides the dilemma of the NNS acting as a court here I would like to point out two problems that arise from this case. If the entire story is true a thief now has more voting power than most of us will ever have. 

Secondly you can't track spawned neurons, which come from minting transaction. So this thief could very easily cash out the rewards from this stolen neuron.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-15 12:16:29 UTC | #145

I have to agree with people above that a real world theft would have to be dealt with in the real world legal system. If the theft would have been through some exploit within the NNS it would be a different story.

While feeling sympathy for the OP, I don't think having the NNS vote on this is a good idea. If I lose my II through negligence (not implying this was the case), who is the judge? The NNS? Sorry for OP, but I think this is a very slippery road we would get ourselves on here...

-------------------------

kmanxhuka | 2021-12-15 12:35:21 UTC | #146

I'm very curious to see if this neuron will vote in thr proposal. If votes we would know that the user has been reading the forum and this thread.

Thank you for working so extensively with Dfinity on this issue and making your case.  You do have compelling evidence and this is an issue that any one of us can face.  Certainly this proposal will set a precedent and there will be a divided community on how it should be handled.  Personally, I don’t know how I would vote yet, but I do have empathy for your situation and I would like to offer some suggestions that I think might give you the best chance of success.  It’s totally your decision how to proceed and you are free to ignore these suggestions.

A) There might be risk if you ask for the seed phrase to be reset to the original seed phrase.  It doesn’t sound like you can rule out the possibility that someone else knows the original seed phrase.  You might be better off creating a new internet identity and asking the NNS to assign neuron ownership to that new principal ID.

B) There is evidence that someone controls the internet identity that owns the neuron.  Hence, there is a person on the other side of this story that will be affected if your proposal is successful.  A lot of arguments against this proposal will come from the perspective of “how do we know that you didn’t transfer, sell, etc this neuron / internet identity?”  These are fair questions, so your proposal should account for how justice can be served if someone else really is the rightful owner of the neuron.  This discussion has been going on in the forum and on social media for a while now and nobody has come forward as the other side of the story.  Maybe your proposal should involve actions that will force them to come forward if they are the rightful owner.  

Your proposal could include the following: 
1) Change the dissolve state to not dissolving, 
2) Change the dissolve delay to 8 years, 
3) Remove all followees from the voting configuration of this neuron; 
4) Remove the recovery and devices from the internet identity, 
5) Wait 1 year to give the current owner time to come forward with a claim to the ownership of the frozen neuron, 
6) If someone comes forward with proof of ownership within 1 year, then add the current devices back to the internet identity, otherwise, transfer the neuron to your new internet identity.  

There could be other mechanics for how to accomplish the goal, but the point is to suspend the account in a way that forces the current owner to contact Dfinity for support.  If they are the rightful owner, then they will have the same anxiety that you felt when you first lost access and will come forward with evidence of ownership.  You have clearly demonstrated original ownership of the neuron.  You need to give the current owner an opportunity to defend themselves if they can make a claim of current ownership.  Once they have been identified, then you can invite your local legal system to get involved in arbitration of the dispute as well.

I don’t know if this suggestion is technically feasible, but I’m just trying to think creatively about ways that you and others can potentially recover from stolen identities in a way that gives the NNS governing body higher confidence that this recovery process is fair to both sides.  I would like to see improvements to the recovery process for internet identity as suggested in other forum topics, but we have to deal with our current system.  That system assumes that we carefully protect and restrict access to our devices and recovery mechanisms.  Since you are claiming that someone other than yourself gained access to your internet identity without your permission, it seems reasonable that recovery of your account should be hard and time consuming.  My hope is that you set a precedent for how we can all regain access to stolen identities.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-15 13:23:37 UTC | #148

Sorry to say but 4 laptops with 2 yubikeys and two people with access, doesn't sound like the safest way to deal with this amount of money. I'm actually quite surprised people would even consider this to be a safe approach.
I'm all for discussing saftey mechanisms that could be implemented to deal with issues like this, identity theft is a real problem and everything that can be done, should be done. Things like delay time when deleting devices/seedphrases, or ranking of recovery mechanisms sound like a good approach.(edit: even having to enter the seedphrase to be able to change it, could be an approach worth thinking about)

What's about having additional layers of security woven in, something like PrivIC from the hackathon?
Whoever wants that additional layer of security can opt-in. https://youtu.be/NuxFeF3wUx0

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 13:43:07 UTC | #149

This account generates more than 20 ICPs per day, so we should freeze this account before confirming the ownership. Do not allow anyone to control this account. When the person who controls the account now finds out that he can't log in, I'm sure if it's him, he will be as anxious as I am to go around and ask for help, contact Dfinity so that he can know that this proposal exists, so that he can submit his evidence. The rest is up to the community to decide who to trust. So can I make a proposal for a long time, say three months or six months?

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 13:47:22 UTC | #150

Theft in the real world should be dealt with in the real legal system, but what about virtual money? Virtual currency has its particularity, which makes it easier for criminals to commit crimes, but it is difficult to find out the evidence of their crimes. We live in this crypto world, and almost every few days we hear about the theft of funds from a certain project, which is only well-known, and there are countless unknown virtual currency crimes that we don't know about. If the real world legal system worked, I'm sure there wouldn't be so much crime.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 13:49:32 UTC | #151

After the proposal is launched, we can know whether this account has participated in the vote. The account I set is to vote with the foundation, but the foundation will not vote for this proposal, so once there is the voting record of this account, it must be operated by thieves

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 13:59:44 UTC | #152

Based on the analysis of the historical block information, the staff can determine that the mnemonic word is not leaked. Of course, the possibility of leakage is not ruled out. Your proposal is good, and I agree that it is fair to give the person currently in possession of the account the opportunity to submit his evidence. Therefore, I wonder if we can extend the voting time of this proposal, or freeze the login of this account first.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-15 14:00:20 UTC | #153

"Virtual money" wasn't stolen though, your Identity was. It was a yubikey that was physically stolen(borrowed?), it seems. And someone had access to your laptop aswell, right? This doesn't sound like a cyber-crime like the things you mentioned, where people get robbed online. You got robbed from someone physically close to you.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 14:11:20 UTC | #154

Under the current evidence, the biggest possibility comes from the people around me. I used one of the two Yubikeys to update the mnemonic without noticing, and then deleted the login device, and I lost control. If you have offended please forgive me, I don't think you in bit jue word, I am stolen 32000 icp and generate revenue, if I yuan had been stolen, so our country's police can easily help me find by the thief, but theft is a virtual currency, now you tell me how to check, the police should monitor with no useful information we have ever seen. All we know is that Dfinity people analyze historical blocks. That's all. I don't know why you're obsessed with whether this is a cybercrime, but isn't our first job to stop it?

Sorry but now I'm confused.

Anyway, I really feel sorry for your loss, I just don't think this is something the NNS should touch however long the pole. If this Pandora's box is opened, and every action/transaction can be reverted by the NNS by popular vote, we are in for a world of pain, imho.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 14:43:57 UTC | #156

I'm sorry. This is my only chance right now. NNS because of its pledge property no one can take away the ICP pledge, just let us have the opportunity to discuss the stolen account recovery problem here. I think the Dfinity community should be happy to seek justice if the people they help are actually victims. So let's talk about how we can make sure we help the real victims. I'm sure you want to help the victim, too, don't you? @wpb  His plan is good. It gives both sides a chance to present evidence.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-15 14:50:50 UTC | #157

The login device was removed on August 14, and I contacted the official support on August 18, for which I have been anxious for four months. I'm about to see the light. Please support me, ok? It's okay if you vote no, and thank you for working on my behalf. I will hold out until I regain control.

As much as I want you to get your money back, for me it is a question of what implications it could have.

I want you to know that I really want you to regain access to your neuron. But this should be achieved through other means. There has to be due-process, and there doesn't seem to be a way for this right now on the IC.

Dfinity did a good job looking into this issue and investigating to see if there is any flaw in the system.
But, as tough as it sounds, the system is fine and the mishap happened on the human-layer. 

Just as a little thought-experiment:
If I put a suitcase full of cash in a vault, and somebody with access to the vault knows the pin, opens the vault and changes the pin. Do I go to the vault manufacturer and ask them to change back my pin to the original one? If I don't try to get to know who is the bad actor, how do I know I'm not getting robbed again, since assumingly the original pin was compromised in the first place?

I don't think the NNS is ready to play court for real-word crimes, it arguably should never be.

And again, nothing personal, I understand there might be reasons you feel like going through the legal system wouldn't serve your case.

-------------------------

zire | 2021-12-15 18:33:50 UTC | #159

Two very, very good points that need more attention on this thread.

-------------------------

zire | 2021-12-15 18:48:47 UTC | #160

No wonder you want to go ahead with the NNS proposal. You want to smoke him out.

IF
you can gather enough support in the IC community prior to the vote AND
DFINITY will sit out of the vote

THEN
THIEF has to detach his vote from DFINITY and cast a No vote to block your proposal

His vote will be visible under the sun as per @Dylan 's post above.

What happens next could be interpreted in a few different ways, but it's getting a bit too Kobayashi.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-15 20:43:57 UTC | #161

I've been thinking about these two points as well.  "Not your keys, not your crypto" is a common crypto principle, but when it is applied to BTC and ETH is doesn't affect anyone other than the victim and the thief.  With ICP, the theft of certain neurons could affect everyone if the neuron is large enough or if it has significant followers.  The thief is only going to be interested in maximizing economic value instead of voting in the long term best interest of the internet computer.  It is impossible to trace reward liquidity back to the stolen neuron, so its a continuous flow of ICP value for the thief while at the same time they could offer the voting power to the highest bidder on a black market.  There could be some serious attack vectors around theft of key internet identities.  In my opinion, these are arguments in favor of seriously considering recovery mechanisms in these cases.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-15 20:41:56 UTC | #162

Agreed. There are a lot of implications beyond the loss of funds. I suspect this will only get worse with time. Luckily Dfinity has identified recovery methods as a future R&D effort.

-------------------------

@wpb suggested proposal makes the most sense and most fair to both you and the current owner . We should hear both sides of the story if there are any . 

The staked neurons should stop giving out rewards and remove the rights to vote . And then , if no one speaks out in a year , the staked neurons will be returned back to you. 

I feel for you .. but to be fair.. I voted no

The root of the problem can be found without exploring...He should get us Support because he is the one who helps us find the problem...this is a problem that needs to be solved

-------------------------

RatherIcy | 2021-12-16 03:47:47 UTC | #171

There is not enough information in the proposal and the other side doesn’t get to tell their side of the story. What if you sold or transferred this internet identity to someone else? 

Voted No.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-16 08:16:11 UTC | #172

Exactly he needs to go use the proper legal channels and get court orders etc. if the farmed icp is being sold some place he should track it and have the police deal with it. For all we know the guy got drunk one night and gambled it all away and now can’t remember and thinks it was stolen. 

Go get a lawyer and do what is proper! Don’t ask us to do the job of police and court system that’s not what this NNS is about…

Honestly your boss should fire you and sue you for your negligence. And frankly if those keys belong to your boss how do we know you aren’t stealing from him? If anything those coins don’t belong to you as an employee.

Really go be professional and do things properly and don’t waste our time. Show some respect for the rule of law and people’s time!

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-16 08:22:12 UTC | #173

Yes sure tell him to file a police report and get court orders and show the evidence in a court of law where he will be liable if he is lying. In this case he has even stated the keys belonged to an employer. It’s not the responsibility of the NNS to adjudicate this matter we are not a government court that’s where these things get handled not by some random mob of people who have 0 clue (myself included) with evidence that can be photoshopped.

-------------------------

vinci | 2021-12-16 08:22:40 UTC | #174


I am willing to believe what @xiaobing said, the stolen account may really belong to Xiaobing. I am a lawyer, I have considered more things, and these things cannot be solved by Dfinity or the voting mechanism. First, how do we judge whether the evidence provided by Xiaobing is real and not fake? Second, how do we rule out other situations that may exist (for example, @xiaobing may have sold the account)? Third, if the thief has sold the account to a third party, Does ICP need to protect third parties?These problems are too difficult to solve. Although I have some solutions in my mind, they are not perfect.

Your words hurt me, people who know this matter know how much effort I have made for this matter, after the account was created, the account has been operated by my boss, I moved out of the company. @zire   investigation report clearly states that the thief changed the mnemonic by using Tig-backup Yubikey on July 26. And I can't get in touch with Yubikey, because I moved out after creating the account, and yubikey has been in the hands of my boss. If you don't believe me, don't you believe Dfinity's research report? We not only had a video conference, but also went to Shanghai in person. Your words are full of prejudice and I don't like you very much.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-16 09:37:15 UTC | #177

You are wasting my time. How about you stealing my time on this because of your lack of respect for the rule of law and my time? 

Do you even have a stolen property police report? 

Go get a court order in an American court and then I will believe any of this. I could care less about what one entity or another opines if they are not an actual court of law.

Humans have developed court systems for 1000s of years now to deal with theft! Show some respect for that process and use it.

Frankly I think the proposal fee needs to be increased a bit so people take things more seriously and show respect for the time of the many people who can vote.

In what way?

I’m genuinely curious because they just recently implemented a simple majority threshold a few weeks ago.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-16 13:01:14 UTC | #181

I don't think 3% should be enough to make decisions about neuron or canister control.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-16 13:18:07 UTC | #182

I just saw your other post in a different thread and I fully agree it should be at least an absolute majority if not 2/3.

Edit: Just checked and I was wrong about how the 3% works. Even more reason to agree with you :slight_smile:

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-16 13:41:30 UTC | #183

This whole case revolves about the difference between possession and rightful ownership. Simply put it's a motion to dispossess someone. This should take more than a few wealthy friends and some luck to slip a motion through somehow. That shouldn't even be possible, in my view.

I'm obviously generally speaking, has nothing to do with if I sympathize with OP or not.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-16 15:13:48 UTC | #184

3% to make a ledger change is nuts. My money would be safer hidden under my mattress… it shouldn’t be possible at all except maybe maybe in very exceptional circumstances requiring practically unanimous agreement (or at least 80%+) of all coins not just 3% that vote where there is literally court orders from every civilized country (never gonna happen).

I’m thinking of a scenario like the holocaust where the nazi steal money and it needs to be taken and given back to victims and nearly every country in the UN signs on.

No wonder our price keeps going down the shitter with stupidity like this it will be sub $10 in a few months

-------------------------

levi | 2021-12-16 15:37:03 UTC | #185

A couple of things seem off to me at this point,
1. At the beginning it seemed like you were a solo person who had an internet identity and all of a sudden couldn’t login one day, now we know you were working for a company that manages crypto funds and used this identity on 4 computers with multiple people having access to it. If there was only two other people working there who could have possibly stolen it, i think this is something you should take up with your local police. We also know now that you were working with a boss and it is still not clear whos icp it is? 

2. We know now thanks to dfinity that it is not a bug or a hack in the internet identity code. Which means that if it was stolen it is your negligence alone that caused it to be stolen.

3. Your evidence (if it not photoshopped) shows that you were there when the neuron was being made. It doesn’t prove your ownership now. Since we now know that you were working as part of a company that manages crypto portfolio, it seems like a possibility to me that your company was managing someone else’s funds and maybe you got into a disagreement with them and now you want to use the nns to take the funds away from them. 

4. The fact that as soon as I asked my question 
[quote="levi, post:163, topic:7896, full:true"]
[quote="zire, post:105, topic:7896"]

@zire i don’t understand, how can this sentence be true then?
[/quote]

You rushed to make the proposal. 



I want to put the neuron into the hands of the rightful owner, but with the these facts, I don’t know who the rightful owner is. Since I don’t know, I rather the worst possibility that you lose your icp due to your own negligence, than the worst possibility that we take away someone else’s rightful icp. 

I vote no.

I agree with the above, we are not a court of law and don't have the ability to fully judge the evidence. Theres is just no way we can know. I always get worried when people get personally offended when other's try to consider the evidence presented.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-16 18:42:43 UTC | #189

So I don’t disagree with your points at all. I also believe it should be **nearly** impossible to make a change like this.

I don’t agree with this sentiment. Anyone can propose anything, at any time. I understand you think it’s stupid but that’s why we have these forums and discussions. No one forces you to review all these comments and take the time to respond. You can always just vote and move along with your day.

talkingant | 2021-12-16 19:43:22 UTC | #190

This situation makes a case for building in an on-chain court system. For example it could have permissions to reverse identity anchor changes for 90 days post. The Kleros project is set up to economically incentive anonymous individuals to reach consensus on truth. Pure token voting like the NNS is a way to establish token holder preferences, but not reach truth. For that reason, the NNS cannot set a precedent of using it as a source of truth (IE who is the legitimate owner of an account). The NNS must reject proposals asking it to do this. 

The silver lining of this situation is the neuron is locked for 8 years. By then, there is a chance we have an on chain court to handle issues like this. Or hopefully the alleged hacker is caught by law enforcement by then.

Hi @xiaobing 

I am very sorry you are having to go through such process. 
Were you KYC verified on exchange you purchased your total sum of ICP?

-------------------------

Swoop | 2021-12-16 22:42:15 UTC | #192

It seems like the proposal **may** pass, technically speaking it's just reverting his internet anchor to his original state and mnemonic, why is there not more support for this? 

@xiaobing has proven the entire chain of custody on this. I will be glad to see him get control of this neuron again, I agree he is the rightful owner given the evidence. I understand dfinity is not a court of law, but it seems that what happened here is obvious. 

My concern is that it does set a precedence of intervention, it seems the long-term fix really needs to be no change of mnemonics allowed after creation.

-------------------------

RatherIcy | 2021-12-16 23:36:39 UTC | #193

>why is there not more support for this? 

We are not a court of law, simple as that. If this really is stolen, OP should go to the police and the exchanges and file reports to solve this in a court of law. It was due to OP’s own negligence as he himself said. 

Blockchains should NEVER be the arbiters of whose coins belong to who. It’s not our job. Secure your funds and this doesn’t happen.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-17 00:29:44 UTC | #194

@xiaobing convinced me that he/his boss was the owner of the account through the evidence that he presented. Once I reached that decision and given the fact that what he was asking  was not technically infeasible (i.e. Dfinity, through @zire confirmed that this was not impossible), I felt that there was no choice but to vote my conscience.  Therefore I voted yes.

I have read through the decision making process of the no votes.  This are my three buckets of the no votes so far. 
 1. No because you don't believe the evidence that has been presented
 2. No because you think the exploration of evidence and counter arguments need more time
 3. No because you think this proposal should not have been brought into NNS proposal in the first place

I have found out some facts through this topic AFTER I voted. So I do think that in the future I would definitely demand more time on such issues. I have struggled with 3 quite a lot. **The very existence of a mechanism to revert back a change (revert to the original mnemonic) is deeply concerning to me**. As I have mentioned in the first paragraph, I submit that is not the issue before us in the current proposal.

I will present a detailed economic case separately of how the existence of such a mechanism could be exploited in the future ( I am NOT alleging that this was done in this case) for the benefit of a determined adversary playing by the exact same rules set up here. In a nutshell here, a variation of ability to transfer existing neurons (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-ecdsa-signatures/6152/111) temporarily could sway the vote-count in favor of a determined adversary for a specific proposal. While I am not aware about any current such buy-the-vote schemes, it is entirely possible in the future with appropriate systems in place as I will show.

Swoop | 2021-12-17 01:40:17 UTC | #195

> Blockchains should NEVER be the arbiters of whose coins belong to who.

I agree, I said that I thought it sets a dangerous precedence. I was only curious as it is a proposal it should have plenty of documentation. I do feel sorry for @xiaobing , though. As others have said it is deeply concerning if it passes, it is also deeply concerning the mnemonic may be altered.

-------------------------

tgalal | 2021-12-17 01:58:55 UTC | #196

Just curious about people voting No because they believe OP should have instead gone to court. Say OP does go to court, and say it rules for him even without identifying the thief. OP comes back with proof and makes a new proposal. Would you still vote against?

Just in. The bill failed to pass. I expected the bill to fail, but what I didn't expect was such a lopsided margin of approval.

1. Some people doubt the authenticity of the evidence.

2. Others believe that the person who currently controls the account should be given the opportunity to rebut it;

3. Some people think that this should not be handled by NNS and should be handled by the police.

My answer:

1. We can provide the KYC of binance account. If necessary, we can also provide the video (because some people suspect that the photo has been photoshopped). When we went to Shanghai, we also showed the transaction records of binance account on our mobile phone to @zire  So I think this is enough to prove that the binance account transferring ICP to 171674 is ours;

2. I think this needs more discussion to work out a mutually acceptable and fair way (such as @wpb 's plan);

The police have been investigating, it is difficult to confirm who the thief is with the current evidence. ICP generate neurons we temporarily can't track to the returns, and ICP pledge for eight years, 32000 in the eight years of the time it will not transfer, if the transfer or not transfer eight years later, or never that we would be much to find the thief (according to the current earnings to calculate the yield of 8 years to produce enough the thief to live a good life, The thief could have increased the chance of exposing himself without moving 32,000 ICPs.) I would like to ask those people who think that this proposal I sponsored opens Pandora's box, shouldn't we help the victims? Another way to think about it is that if the proposal is used properly it will benefit everyone in the community, right?

We can talk about how to make it sound, how to make sure it helps victims and not thieves?

My boss's take on the failed proposal:
I didn't expect that the NNS proposal I initiated would have such a result, with the negative vote outnumbering the yes vote by a wide margin! Although this is the blockchain world, it feels like people can ignore the true ownership of assets, and instead agree that anyone who steals other people's assets or mnemonics can legally own them. If the blockchain field can be divorced from the normal world view and values, then what is the meaning of participation and ownership? Because anyone has the chance of being robbed, and this is indeed an individual case, who can guarantee that the same thing will not happen to him? 1. If you question the screenshot of evidence I provided, there are hashes of each transaction in it, why not verify it and then make a decision? 2. If you think that I will take possession of the assets of the account after selling the account to others, why do you steal or dare not directly provide the transaction agreement or transaction record of transfer purchase? I'm not stupid enough to give away digital assets of this size for free! The problems and causes of this incident are not purely personal factors, not properly kept, or the computer was hacked, or it may be stolen by internal personnel. However, we should not ignore an important reason, that is, the key generated by the official can be repeated and modified many times, that is, as long as someone obtains other people's mnemonic or Yubikey, he can steal other people's assets, but the assets are frozen and locked accounts in the project side, is this mechanism set 100% reasonable? Of course, I will not give up on the result of one proposal, I will continue to launch it, and seek help from the police system and social resources. The person who steals his or her assets will not get or enjoy the wealth brought by this asset. On the contrary, he or she will be sentenced to prison...

My take on this ..

First, you must know that you are in crypto . Simple thing such as missing a number on your wallet address when you are transferring and your funds are gone forever. Same goes for fund getting stolen.. 

If your funds are stolen by hacker in crypto what can the exchanges and authorities do ? Exchange at most can freeze the funds but there's no way it can be returned back to the owner if the hacker doesn't want to . 

And for your case , you didn't protect such a huge amount of funds carefully and loss it as a result. If the funds are not locked up for 8 years , I'm pretty sure it has already has been liquidated by the hacker . 

I truly think freezing up the neuron and stop rewarding the hacker daily is what you can propose next and most likely will pass in the proposal.

it probably will change the mind of a few that suggested that. But we are a huge community and now it feels impossible to recover anything that is lost (due to so many factors to consider) . And honestly, the majority of the community rather not care or vote .

There are only a few employees in your company that has access to the key right ? So is easy to narrow down? But because due to the lack of evidence , police is hard to do anything ? 

In this case , I can suggest that you can negotiate the terms with the staffs of your company . Release a notice , ask the thief to join a chat anonymously discuss the terms for a return instead of getting nothing for both of you (if the neuron gets freezed)

Good enough, pass the vote. This is shameful.

I’m not sure what part OP is failing to understand about why his ‘boss’’ proposal failed. Go find the employee that stole it from one of the FOUR devices you had attached to it. 

You lost control of your assets due to personal negligence. YOU failed to secure your assets. What about the thousands of people this has already happened to? Are we supposed to rewind time and give their money back? 

Blockchains are not courts of law. We don’t have any responsibility to say who owns that neuron. If this terrible proposal passes, it sets a precedent that ANYONE’s coins can be frozen or moved at any time. 

The proposal won’t pass, in any form.
