It has been two months since I lost control of my NNS account, and I have communicated with Dfinity staff for two months to deal with this matter. Now the latest situation is that the public key in my hand is inconsistent with the public key in the system by comparing the public key. Dfinity's conclusion is as follows: - You have the wrong identity anchor number. (But 00000 is the one which was included in the seed phrase correct?)

- You have been hacked and somebody has generated a new seed phrase.

- There is a bug that has caused this, but nobody so far has contacted with the same problem.

Dfinity doesn't have time to deal with this anytime soon. I don't know what to do, please help me

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-10-14 05:52:37 UTC | #2

00000 is likely NOT the correct anchor number.

If you have the seed phrase but have lost the anchor number, you could certain try to automate the recovery by trying all different likely anchor numbers along with the seed phrase and see which one sticks. 
(This, btw, is a problem with cold wallets that can store the 24 word seed phrase; but nowhere to store the anchor number in addition).

If your identity has been hacked and seed phrase changed, there is not much that can be done.

If it is a bug, then it should likely manifest itself with someone else as well. It doesn't seem to have. Therefore the likelihood of it being a bug is small

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-14 06:08:25 UTC | #3

The identity anchor number and the mnemonic are correct.  I can provide the binance KYC of the transaction address of this account to prove that the account is mine

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-10-14 08:48:54 UTC | #4

Hey there,

As the person who helped you with your ticket 000000 is not the Identity anchor you used in the our correspondence correct? Are you using it as an example here to not expose your real Identity Anchor or was there a miscommunication?

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-14 09:00:36 UTC | #5

* I hid my identity anchor number

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-10-14 13:50:51 UTC | #6

It will be necessary to have a recovery system.  The lack of such a system is very scary for investors.  Why not implementing a 4 mandatory way:   SMS + Email + 3 personal questions + face recognition or fingerprint to recover the identity number. Then SMS + Email + 3 different question + face recognition or fingerprint to get in the II manager to add or change devices.
Seed phrase is something I don't want to have (and I do not have) and should not be available.  This is such a weak recovery system.
Don't wait some people loose access to their account and take this to the media to act.  once trust is destroy, it is very difficult to earn it back.
May be some have much better idea but one thing for sure, we need it somehow.

Can you provide more details such as, did you also recorded the right identity anchor, did you use the same computer to operate, the entire operation process? so as to help analyze?

Hey xiaobing,

I'm am very sorry that you still don't have access to your funds and hope you will regain it somehow, but this seems like a mischaracterisation of the help I tried to provide. 

First we made very sure that you went to the process of recovering with your seed phrase correctly and you were using the correct Identity Anchor.

I even wrote a hacky custom program to get the public key from your private key locally to see if the seedphrase was incorrect somehow:

https://github.com/ocluf/seedToPublic

This public key did not match to the one tied to the identity anchor. If there was a bug in the canister somehow that would mean:

- only your memory was corrupted somehow
- this perfectly removed other public keys
- this corruption perfectly altered your seed phrase public key to another valid public key.

Therefore the chance seems pretty much zero that this is the result of a bug. At this point there isn't really anything anymore we can do for you.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 09:02:34 UTC | #20

First of all, thank you for your help. Dfinity is responsible for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of coin holders. I believe there will be other users who lose control of their accounts for various reasons. I can provide materials to prove that the account belongs to me, and Dfinity should have a mechanism to help us restore control. As John Wiegley said, launch a proposal, let the community vote, vote yes and I will regain control of the account.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 09:05:27 UTC | #21

I have carefully protected my account. I prepared two Yubikeys and mnemonic words, and then TESTED them to restore my account before I pledged ICP. I did not expect such a problem would happen, and I still do not know the reason. This is all my money, pledged for eight years

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2021-10-15 09:08:16 UTC | #22

Can you know if the 24 words of the account was changed or not?

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-10-15 09:15:20 UTC | #23

No I can't see that. The only thing I know for sure is that the seedphrase he currently has is *a* correct seedphrase but not the *the* correct seedphrase. 

when querying the II identity canister there are also no backup security keys tied to the account

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-15 09:23:08 UTC | #24

@Fulco Do you know where the total-funds are? What bout if we track the funds from the date that he bought the icp and see which principals moved it. The ledger stores the transactions.

Hey Levi, 

xiaobing can share the information about what the specific transactions/funds we are talking about himself If he wants to. It doesn't seem right for me to do that for him.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 09:46:00 UTC | #27

I do. I just withdraw the proceeds from the pledge every few days, and within two months I lost control of the account

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 09:47:19 UTC | #28

32,000 ICPs were pledged for 8 years

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-15 09:50:07 UTC | #29

It is possible. They are saying they don’t have the time. Right now the ledger only gives the historic blocks in protobuff for some reason (btw if anyone on dfinity has a reason why they couldn’t make the historic blocks into a candid interface at the beginning? I am curious.) also I think only one block at a time is queryable at this time which makes it take more time to track transactions. They are saying in 2-3 weeks they will have a better api for the historic blocks on the ledger, that will make it simple enough to track your funds. Once you track your funds from the original purchase, you’ll see where they are. Then maybe you can make a nns-proposal to get them back. This is the whole point of a ledger. Here , can you post here the original date of your purchase and the full amount of the original purchase(s) and the principal that made the original purchase(s) and any other transfer of the funds that you made and that you know about since that time.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 09:54:07 UTC | #30

The ICP I pledged has been transferred from my binance account, and the income generated by the pledge has also been withdrawn to my binance account. I can provide the KYC of my binance account, which I think is enough to prove that the account is mine.

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-15 09:59:53 UTC | #31

Doesn’t seem right for you to share the transactions data? Or to track the funds for him?

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 09:55:39 UTC | #32

As for the proof materials, I think it is more appropriate to submit them to Dfinity, what do you think?

Hey Levi,

I'm actually just someone from support who knows how to program. However I believe this is something which is on the teams mind.

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-15 10:12:51 UTC | #36

Ok, the KYC data you can save for when you make an nns-proposal after you find where the funds are. Let’s start with the
 - date (& time if you have it) that you transferred the funds out of your binance account into the internet-identity/nns
 - full amount transferred, (if it was in more that one transaction then say each transaction and the amount of it. 
 - the principals of the transaction: for and by 

You can get this data from your binance account should have a history.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 10:09:53 UTC | #37

Do you just post it here? Would it be unsafe? I met a lot of scammers when I went into Discord for help

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-15 10:12:19 UTC | #38

It is safe , those three pieces of data are safe to publicize. Keep your passwords and private-keys with your self though.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 10:19:57 UTC | #39

Ok, thank you for your help. I will prepare all transaction records of this account in these two days. Does that mean I can take all the trade records and make a proposal

[/quote]

Yes. When there is a trace of the money from when it left your binance to where it is now then you can make a proposal to put it back into your controll. Of course the community and the nns-vote will vote on whether they think that you are telling the truth or not with a base on the trade-records and the other evidence that you show.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-15 10:37:07 UTC | #41

We can follow the money on the ic.rocks. It could be simple.

We may be looking at a collision of some thing. 

Two more things that will help: 
  - the last date & time (best you know) you were able to use the ii with the success 
 - the first date and time that the ii didnt work for your keys anymore

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-10-15 13:05:14 UTC | #43

I just want to say I'm eager to get this resolved as well, imagining if it happened to me.

Just to clarify, you had two yubikeys and a seed phrase, and none of them work anymore for your anchor?

And it sounds like the seed phrase is a correct seed phrase, but the public key of the seed phrase does not match the public key of the identity anchor stored in the canister.

Also the yubikeys are no longer associated with that anchor in the canister.

Things seem to be pointing toward a hack, especially since every form of authentication seems to have been removed from the anchor. Or if not a hack, let's say there were a collision on the seed phrase, the other key holder might have removed all yubikeys and changed the seed phrase? But I don't understand how the seed phrase is for a different public key now, I might have to study II more.

No solutions, just talking. Tracking the funds is probably the next best step.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-10-15 14:01:11 UTC | #44

@Fulco 

This thing about it "**being a** correct seed phrase but **not the correct** seed phrase" is causing a lot of concern. 

Can you please clarify as to what it means to be "a correct seed phrase"?

(A) Are you saying that the seed phrase merely conforms to BIP39 standard?

OR

(B) Are you saying that the seed phrase actually belongs to some other anchor?

@lastmjs 
Maybe I missed it; but not sure about where you got the impression that the seed phrase is linked to another anchor? 

The likelihood of it being a hack seems to be larger than a seed phrase collision. HOWEVER if it is a seed phrase collision, we might have much bigger problems.

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-10-15 14:09:27 UTC | #45

No need for panic! Seed phrases don't work with internet identity like they do in something like bitcoin or ethereum.

You internet Identity simply consists of your Identity Anchor and public keys that are registered with your identity anchor. 

When you use a device like a phone or yubikey the private key is stored on your device and to authenticate you sign some data. The seed phrase works the same way but is stored in plain text. 

Just like you can remove devices from your Internet Identity (which removes the associated public key) you can also remove your seed phrase and generate new ones.

What I mean with correct seed phrase is indeed that that it confirms to the BIP39 standard.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-10-15 14:41:10 UTC | #47

The seed phrase is apparently for a public key that is not associated with the anchor of the OP. Seems like it once was associated with the anchor of the OP, but is not anymore...I wonder if there are any public keys associated with his anchor now

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-10-15 14:55:05 UTC | #48

There is likely at least one key associated with this anchor.

It is possible to delete all keys associated with an anchor...in which case the anchor is lost FOREVER. iC will then "forget" this anchor...except that future anchors cannot reuse this anchor...is my understanding.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-16 02:14:10 UTC | #49

Yes, the two Yubikeys and the mnemonic words are invalid. I tested the seed phrase when I first registered to restore the account, otherwise I dare not pledge so many ICP

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-10-16 15:33:23 UTC | #50

Hey, do you know where the proposal entry is？

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-17 20:27:04 UTC | #51

Hi, I think you are the first person to ask this question on the forum. It is on the governance-canister on the manage_neuron method. A neuron can make a proposal. The proposal type can be to ExecuteNnsFunction. You can see this public-method here: https://ic.rocks/principal/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai : ![Screenshot_2021-10-17_14-21-47|690x387](upload://fE9Qa4agm9ZTgHJruJxhrW1dNAV.png)
There are multiple nns-functions that a proposal can do, you can see the list of them and their int32-codes here: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/bd3b73e075aea1cc81b23b38ccfb138ca4ab17ab/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L322 . At this time there is no specific proposal type that can transfer icp funds between accounts. The nns-function-code: [4](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/bd3b73e075aea1cc81b23b38ccfb138ca4ab17ab/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L346-L350) is the one to upgrade a canister on the nns-subnetwork. We can use that to change the ii canister if there is a bug and to change the ledger & governance canisters for a new nns-function that can transfer icp funds between some accounts if there is a successfull-vote. The payload for the nns-function: 4 is with the candid-bytes of this record: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/bd3b73e075aea1cc81b23b38ccfb138ca4ab17ab/rs/nns/handlers/root/src/common.rs#L72-L113 . 
I will get to work writing the code on the ledger and governance canisters for the specific nns-proposal-function to transfer icp-funds and writing the scripts to set-up a proposal for the canister-upgrades. Once that is successfull, you can send a simple proposal from your own neuron to get your funds back, or someone else can do the proposal for you, maybe contact internetcomputer.org they are supposed to be helping people make proposals. There is no UI that i know of to submit new proposals, but I can write a script for you that calls the public_methods. The nns-ui doesnt give you access to your own keys of the neurons so you cant make your own custom calls on those neurons. So if you want to run a script and submit a proposal yourself then I can give you a script that will create some new keys, print your new principal's-icp-id, then youd fund your new icp-id with some ICP, then run the script to create a new neuron, save and keep track of those ids and keys, and then call the neuron to create a proposal. (or someone might create a ui for people to create neurons and proposals). The first proposals will be to upgrade the ledger and the governance canisters for a new nns-proposal-function that can transfer icp between some accounts. Me or someone else who works on this, will put up these proposals. Also pending on what we see when we track your funds, we might have to upgrade the internet-identity-canister. Then when you have your evidence ready, you (or someone else) can put up a proposal to transfer the funds into your controll.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-12 01:18:02 UTC | #59

Just in, my account has been stolen, the mnemonic has been changed, and the original device has been deleted. My last hope is to launch a motion to regain control of him. Do you think it has a good chance of passing?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-11-12 09:16:41 UTC | #60

I would definitely support this motion; provided a solid process is defined by the community and followed. I feel that you have quite sincere and diligent in your efforts.

Whether it would pass or not would be upto the total vote of the community. Since this is the first time such a motion would be considered, I am not sure about the time frame.

As @levi mentioned, this would likely be two different proposals. 

@levi : regatding the first proposal, since all of @xiaobing ICP is staked, I am not sure about what type of nns function would need to be created. I.e. THE ICP is locked. I don't know whether you would be able to transfer the locked ICP.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-12 10:05:10 UTC | #61

First of all, thank you for your support. What I'm confused about is that there is no such process at present, and I don't know how to launch this proposal. I hope this will be known to more people, and I hope that in the future, when someone has a similar situation, they will know clearly what to do.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-11-12 13:31:03 UTC | #62

I hope you can get back your account.  At the same time, it is very scary if Dfinity can technically do this.
I have posted few times about this possibility where your mnemonic can be hacked and then the hacker can easily remove all your devices.  Dfinity can and should provide more safety and create barriers to remove devices.  A lot can be done, including a log of login in and out of your account (ip, date, time, device name, etc) so the real owner would know someone else have access to his account.  Security secret questions, sms, email, so many things can be added.  Kraken has a great security system with Global Settings Lock that could be implemented in the decentralized NNS.
Hope Dfinity will prioritize much stronger security for account holders.
I, personally, do not use mnemonics (no keyboard typing) as I believe this is the weakest (bad) way.  I only use hardware device like Nano, Yubikey and finger print.
Will be interesting to see how it turn out.
Keep us posted please

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2021-11-12 14:00:15 UTC | #63

Totally agree with you. Hope @xiaobing could get back his account finally. Also hope @xiaobing could share the latest info with us here.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-11-12 14:43:10 UTC | #64

How did you come to this conclusion?

This is very concerning, how did this happen?

-------------------------

levi | 2021-11-12 16:33:21 UTC | #65

I think the IC is not ready to have people outside dfinity call for a proposal that changes the code, first thing for that to happen is for the complete codebase and build to be public. I think people can start proposing motion proposals but dfinity can say no to a motion proposal even if it passes because motion proposals don’t change the code they just make a vote. With that said, a motion proposal may be a good way to get dfinity to start working on switching the internet identity mnemonic phrase for @xiaobing if the community votes on it and if dfinity sees that the community wants it (maybe they will do it, but maybe not). I think if you are going to make a motion proposal, then for people to see what’s going on, to put the evidence and the account trail somewhere public so people can see and ask questions before you make the proposal. One last thing I can say is maybe try to contact this place https://support.internetcomputer.org/

-------------------------

janosroden | 2021-11-12 19:19:34 UTC | #66

I think a fairly easy to implement and safe solution would be to add an account level setting "new recovery device activation delay" and a per recovery device setting during add like "dissolve delay" - explicit remove required after that.

The first does not allow to the hacker to register his device immediately, the second doesnt let him to kick other devices.

In this particular case xiaobing checked the account every 2 days and plannad for long term so he could have set the first delay to six months.
His recovery yubikey also could have some long dissolve delay.

Note that I'm talking about recovery device management only.

Some warning would be nice about recovery device changes.

Basically the idea is if there is no way to immediately give the account to somebody then nobody can steal it.

Several time, I have posted that we should have better security (2FA, etc) for our neurons.  Just found out about how easy it would be to hack fingerprint login.  I will remove all mine from II. I hope Dfinty will work on this as priority.  Protecting investors has no value.

kpeacock | 2021-11-19 23:49:10 UTC | #70

The safest authentication method has been and still is a security key. Ideally, you can use one with a PIN, such as the a Ledger Nano with Fido u2f enabled. The vast majority of hacking is done by social engineering and stolen passwords, and physical attacks like this are statistically a low risk

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-29 11:01:01 UTC | #71

I did to. @zire, we really need to prevent this king of issues by making necessary to enter the seedphrase before being able to supress it ! At least, it would allow to not lose forever out neurons and our staked ICP. I just started a new post about this, more and more people scare about this ! This can’t be delayed anymore. Otherwise, the world will spread quickly and people won’t stake anymore.

DFINITY team has worked with @xiaobing on this case pretty extensively in the last few weeks and devoted substantial engineering resources in the investigation. It was a high priority item for us, given the potential implications. I've met with OP @xiaobing in person once and had 2 zoom-calls with @PaulLiu connecting from the West Coast. I'll write up a post to explain what happened. In short, the data trail revealed by the investigation suggested that:

- This was not caused by any bug in the Internet Computer
- OP's computer was most likely hacked and the hacker very likely had physical access to his laptop.

Stay tuned for the post that will explain in details what DFINITY did to help the OP, the full story behind OP's case, and what we can learn from the investigation.

I don’t deny your availability, I don’t doubt about it one sec. But whatever the singularities of this case, every one suffer of the possibility of having his seedphrase suppressed easily, cause the seedphrase is not asked for this, so everyone risks to lose forever Identity, neurons, and staked ICP

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-29 11:14:36 UTC | #75

Exactly, physical access to the laptop. But he would not have suffered this loss of control if the seedphrase had not been changeable without having to enter the seedphrase in the first place.

-------------------------

I think that even if this is not the alpha and the omega, set this would be a very important security layer. Afterwhat, the rest could be improve. But firstly, we can’t be able to supress as easily the seedphrase anymore. Just set the necessity of log the seedphrase before being able to change it or supress it. We will avoid a lot of issues.

@Roman You can carry on with your usual activities on NNS and Internet Computer with staking and etc. There is no need to be scared. Good old Internet Computer works fine, as far as we know. 

There is a reason why no other similar case to @xiaobing has been reported anywhere in the community. So far it seems to be a singular, one-of-a-kind case, that does not apply to other users.

It's highly probable that the OP got hacked by an insider. It's not pleasant to present this scenario, but after eliminating all other possibilities, this is the one scenario that could not be categorically ruled out.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-29 11:35:34 UTC | #78

But @zire, is it in coding term heavy to set the necessity of enter the seedphrase being able to suppress it ? Because not doing it is a very risky gamble. Don't you think this is a god idea ?
you have to know that I almost not use ICP, because I am too scared to install iPhone and Touch ID on my Mac, because anyone hacking or stealing my phone/Mac, could suppress my seedphrase easily. Consequence, I don't use any app. I have to connect my ledger FIDOU2F before any use of ICP, so I do it once a day, to merge my maturity, but don't have patience to to it each time I can't to use ICP. So I don't. I won't be alone.

Except if we use yubikey or ledger FIDO(U2F), anybody stealing a Mac or a iPhone could suppress the seedphrase in one moment. By not setting the necessity of entering the seedphrase before suppressing it, the defenses of ICP against steal/hack are those of Apple, etc. So, the only solution for now is not connected the internet Identity to any devices, except Yubikey and ledger, so we can't use ICP on the phone. Consequence, I never go district and will never use dapp optimized for phone use.

Believe me, @zire, i am not alone.

First of all, THANKS to @zire  and @PaulLiu , WITH their help I know for sure that my account was stolen. Most likely, someone around me had access to one of my two Yubikeys, and then modified the mnemonic and deleted my two Yubikeys.At present, I think the biggest reason for this is of course our improper custody. Secondly, I think it is also questionable that the mnemonic can be changed, because almost no mnemonic can be changed in other cryptocurrencies.The good thing is that the ICP in my account has been pledged for 8 years.That gave me time to retrieve my account.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-29 12:49:16 UTC | #80

At present, no one has met the same situation as me, so I don't know how to retrieve the stolen account. Now my only hope is to initiate the proposal. Now I am preparing to initiate the proposal, and I would like to ask you to vote for me no matter for or against.I also hope that my experience can serve as a reference for future generations, and of course I hope that no one will ever lose their account.It was a very unfortunate experience.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-11-29 14:22:49 UTC | #81

Based on publicly disclosed information that you have shared,  there are a couple of additional hypothesis that I have.

A. If you took a picture of your seed phrase on your phone, that picture might be somehow compromised.

B. The second hypothesis is MERELY A CONJECTURE AT THIS POINT. This thread(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/frontend-security/8949) discusses how agentjs is storing information in local storage and how xss extension hacks are able to access this information to call canister methods. I HAVE NOT VERIFIED THAT THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS ACTUALLY MANIFEST IN THE INTERNET IDENTITY APP.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-29 14:26:46 UTC | #82

The mnemonic was taken with a professional camera not a cell phone, the mnemonic was not stolen, the mnemonic was replaced with a Yubikey, and then the new mnemonic was used to delete the two Yubikeys

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-11-29 14:32:20 UTC | #83

Thanks for clarifying on how the picture was taken. 

On your second point, currently you can have two recovery mechanisms; mnemonic AND a yubi key. Perhaps the attacker got a hold of the account and then added additional yubikey as recovery.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-29 14:43:09 UTC | #84

I have two Yubikeys. The attacker took one yubikey, changed the mnemonic, and after some time deleted both Yubikeys.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-29 14:44:33 UTC | #85

This is what the technical team came up with after analyzing the historical block information.Thanks again for their help. They were great.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2021-11-30 00:15:46 UTC | #86

Thanks for sharing, if you could provide enough evidence for the proposal in the future, I will support. I believe from community point of view, the ICP controlled by you is much better than by the robber.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-11-30 01:21:59 UTC | #87

Thank you. I'll get all the evidence out before I make a motion.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-30 03:18:05 UTC | #88

I would definitely support your proposal given everything I’ve learned. To be most effective I recommend you follow the standard set by @wpb in his proposal. Gather your evidence, prepare an article to plead your case and I’m sure the community will step up to assist 🙂

xiaobing | 2021-11-30 03:24:33 UTC | #89

Thank you. I saw this proposal from @wpb  about an hour ago, and I think it would be the best way to launch my proposal

Shabbibi1 | 2021-11-30 23:54:55 UTC | #90

My friend! I have the same problem  did you find a solution? I could use some help🙏

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-01 00:20:39 UTC | #91

Please explain the problem as xiaobing has done. It might be a different problem. Have you reached out to dfinity?

-------------------------

Shabbibi1 | 2021-12-01 00:26:32 UTC | #92

When I wanted to log in a message in Swedish appeared saying" use security key with Identity.Ic0.app" when I pushed the ok button it said choose how you want to use the key, by USB  by nfc or by Bluetooth🤦‍♂️ I haven't activated anything like that😞

-------------------------

Shabbibi1 | 2021-12-01 00:29:29 UTC | #93

I reached out to dfinity, and the guy told me to use my seedphrase to restore my account. Tried and it didn't work. I have the anchor id and the 24 seedphrase written on a paper.

-------------------------

Shabbibi1 | 2021-12-01 00:32:24 UTC | #94

When I was searching to solve this I came across a few people with the same problem, but didn't see if the solved their issues.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-01 01:59:03 UTC | #95

Dfinity's technical staff analyzed the historical block information and knew that my account was stolen. I wonder if this is an external function that allows all people to query their history records. So you can see what's going on to cause the mnemonic failure.

-------------------------

jonit | 2021-12-01 10:05:07 UTC | #97

Is there the possibility of user defined security options such as "send me an email when account is accessed", or "limit the location of the access device"? They could go some way to make it harder for other people to steal an account

-------------------------

[quote="jonit, post:97, topic:7896"]

Also some time delay when you want to change mnemonic would be nice

I am not an expert at all.

All I know about the case is from this thread.
I am so sorry for you, and I really hope you get back your fund.

I am just still curious about one thing and I really hope you clear it up. A skeptical view about the case would be the possibility that the staked ICPs were sold, and removal of the seller access was the buyer guarantee. I hope that this hypothesis helps you with preparing the proposal as voters would not be experts.

I will be grateful if you or any expert here help to refute this skeptical view.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-03 06:48:09 UTC | #102

Thank you, your point is very good, someone put forward a similar point, so I will publish the evidence I have when I launch the proposal, assuming the ICP pledge is sold, then the buyer can post his evidence. The rest is up to the voters of the community to decide whom they should trust. And assuming the buyer doesn't know I made the proposal, the buyer can make his proposal in the same way.

-------------------------

xiaobing | 2021-12-03 06:50:17 UTC | #103

Another option is to lock the account down for three or six months, during which no one can access the account, giving the community enough time to determine whether the account has been stolen or sold

-------------------------

ali20ali70 | 2021-12-03 06:58:09 UTC | #104

Thank you.  This really make sense.  Good luck
