I agree. The docs are ok but it is really hard to grasp alot of the material since what the ICP is doing is very different. 

I spent a long time looking at the motoko language and see there is a huge learning curve to new developers. Especially when they say that same line comments are used with this:
//
But in their example code and programs, it looks like they add comments without // which can be very misleading for a new language.
