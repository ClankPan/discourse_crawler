**A new training course called Cryptocurrency World with AROF that will be put into operation in the next 3 months**:

this training system works in such a way that the total income of this plan is bought by BABY AROF tokens and distributed to the people who bought our training course. can be

The purpose of implementing this plan is to grow trained and active users so that we can form a powerful community, this can cause the growth of token transactions and the growth of token liquidity!

**Attracting large capitals:**

Until the beginning of October, we are trying to be able to use the BABY AROF token as a safe way to keep large capitals of Iranian businessmen. If the BABY AROF token is listed in centralized exchanges, the probability of using the BABY AROF token will increase.

**Creating a liquidity pool with COE token:**

This is the investment of the development team, who intend to create team shares with the COE project in the form of a decentralized liquidity pool. This issue can give hope to the COE community and also reduce the liquidity of BABY AROF.

***We wish the best for the whole society, we will build together and for each other and bring freedom to the whole society.***
