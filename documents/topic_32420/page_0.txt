Is there is a way to fetch canister logs using `ic-cdk` or using `agent-rs`. Also is it possible right now for a canister to fetch its own logs?

hi @gravity_vi.

> Is there is a way to fetch canister logs using `ic-cdk` or using `agent-rs` .

currently one can fetch logs using DFX, see examples for [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/rust/canister_logs/Makefile) and [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/canister_logs/Makefile).

`agent-rs` should work fine, because DFX is using it to fetch logs, see [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/dfx/src/lib/operations/canister/mod.rs#L149).

`agent-js` might not yet be up-to-date in regards to reading/writing `log_visibility` but it is going to be fixed soon.

> Also is it possible right now for a canister to fetch its own logs?

no, canisters can not fetch logs as per [specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-fetch_canister_logs):

```
IC method fetch_canister_logs

This method can only be called by external users via non-replicated calls, i.e., it cannot be called by canisters, as replicated calls, and from composite query calls.
```

Thank you @maksym. I have few more questions:

1. How do we upgrade the current canisters log_visibility as `ic_cdk` latest version canister settings does not contain any option for the log_visibility?

2. Our canisters have been structured such that in a subnet all the individual canisters are controlled by one canister (user_index). So that user_index is the controller of the all the existing canisters and responsible for spawning new individual canisters. Assuming there is no way for user_index to fetch logs from all the individual canisters, how can I ensure that exising canisters and as well as new canisters are maked with log_visibility as public?

For the first question: You can pin the `ic_cdk` version to the git rev of [this PR](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/497)

After Severin's PR is merged and released it will be possible to update canister settings and change log_visibility.

Additionally (in a more distant future) we are considering adding allowed list to log_visibility so that it's not fully public and not strictly controllers.

Something what we should also add to our IC4J Java Agent.
