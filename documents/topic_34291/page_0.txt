It all started with AI & Big Data. As most of us are aware ICP used to be under that particular category on Coin Market Cap. However, that’s not the case anymore and it hasn’t been for almost a year now. Yesterday, ICP was removed from the following categories; DePin, Gaming, Privacy, Bitcoin ecosystem, DeFi, etc. This seemed very strange to me because it happened after the head of strategy at Solana Foundation (Austin) commented on one of my tweets regarding Messari’s post (crypto research firm) about DePin projects which also included a graphic showing a list of AI projects but did not include ICP. @dominicwilliams also made a post about this. The post was talking about DePin projects precisely but also had a list of AI projects so I left a comment because I found it misleading since they didn’t include ICP.

I might be reading way too deeply into this so perhaps Coin Market Cap is now charging for categories? If that’s the case I believe the community wouldn’t mind raising capital to put ICP back under those categories. I posted about the issue yesterday on X where Austin left multiple comments still claiming ICP is not a DePin so it makes me wonder if he has any connections with CMC. 

We’ve tried reaching out to Coin Market Cap and some people got responses like “ICP is not an AI project” so I don’t know.. Also, not just anyone can submit a request on CMC about this matter.

Are we able to get this situated and get ICP re-listed under those categories? This helps with exposure since a lot of people search projects based on categories. The only categories ICP is under right now are L1, SEC securities and all the different investors.

As we know, most crypto media like CMC are controlled by the owners of blockchain projects that compete with ICP, and to be honest, ICP threatens their existence. 

So, don't be surprised that media blackout campaigns like this are happening against ICP. 

ICP should start developing its own crypto media for marketing and product awareness. Stop relying on the existing crypto media for promotion.

I know people think ICP is being removed for nefarious purposes, and that might be true, but I still think lots of people don't understand it, including CMC
