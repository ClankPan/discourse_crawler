I am currently doing some development on transfer ICP.
I'd like to know what's is the testnet address and port.
I need to know what's the ledger caninster's principal id too.

Thank you for the great work!

Hi @muchenshou, you can use [this walkthrough](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html) to deploy to Sodium. There isn't public documentation on integrating with the ICP ledger canister just yet, but that should be available very soon. Hope this is a good start for now!
