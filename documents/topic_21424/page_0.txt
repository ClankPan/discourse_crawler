Is `MyActor.MyActor` a shared function or no? The below looks like a contradiction or even a compiler bug:

- `MyActor.MyActor` is called like a shared function using `await`.

- At the same source file, it is assigned to a non-shared function variable (if I uncomment `shared`, it becomes a compile error).

```
// MyActor.mo
shared actor class MyActor() {
};
```

```
// Main.mo
import MyActor "MyActor";

actor Test {
  func test(): async MyActor.MyActor {
    await MyActor.MyActor()
  };

  let c: /*shared*/ () -> async MyActor.MyActor = MyActor.MyActor;
}
```
