Hey, 

I'm trying to get in touch with the dfx CLI. 
There are a few things I'd like to do/ get resolved. 

- Is there a way to set a pw/encrypt my .pem file via the dfx CLI? 

- Furthermore I've asked myself how it would be possible to convert an existing key obtained via nns.ic0.app to a .pem file. I found via this forum that it would be possible via the keysmith tool. 
Is there a similar solution for Ledger HW integration /Yubikey integration via CLI. 
Yubico also offers a CLI. Is there a way to couple it? 

I know it's a gimmick, but I'd really like to login with a Yubikey via the CLI. 

Thx for your answers in advance.
