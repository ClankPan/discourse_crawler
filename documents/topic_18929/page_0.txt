I used to access the motoko base libs at <https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/motoko-ref/iter/> or <https://internetcomputer.org/docs/base-libraries/iter>, but thatâ€™s now a 404.

It seems that they are now at <https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/iter>.

Not sure when that changed, but may I kindly suggest to not break URLs so easily? They are in bookmarks, browser history and (worst) linked from documentation, possibly even in blackholed canisters.

If you _have_ to change URLs, please leave redirects in place.

Also, it it kept up to day? https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Array misses `subArray`, included sinceversion 0.8.4. Maybe the page should include a version annotation.

Right now, we try to have the Motoko documentation in sync with the latest version bundled with dfx. I'll see what I can do to make it more clear

I added version.md IIRC but it would be great if every page had some version indicator.
