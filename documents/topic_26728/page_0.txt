I am building  a simple ICRC 1 Token deployer so that new ICP users can deploy their tokens easily without bothering themselves with tools like dfx.

but i am facing certain problems :

Dynamic deployment of canisters require cycles. These cycles come from the canister that is triggering the deployment.

**Is there any way to accept ICP from users convert them to cycles, top up the canister triggering the deployment and then deploy the canister in motoko?**

Hi @noobie_doobie_doo,

That's a cool and much-needed dapp!

You can use the Cycles Minting Canister (CMC) to burn ICP for cycles. The CMC also allows the creation of a new canister from ICP directly.

To convert ICP to cycles, you need to send ICP with a specific memo to the CMC and notify the CMC about the payment. You can refer to the code in the `dfx ledger top-up` command: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/dfx/src/commands/ledger/top_up.rs

In addition, here's the Candid Interface of the CMC: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/cmc/cmc.did

It may be helpful to take a look at https://github.com/icdevsorg/axon.  Each axon that is deployed gets its own ICRC1 token.  Hopefully, in the coming weeks, I'll have some time to update it to add ICRC2 and 3 as well.  We take pull requests and adding a way to fund cycles would be amazing. :slight_smile:
