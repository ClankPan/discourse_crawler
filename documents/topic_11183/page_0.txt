**Background**
A newly created neuron is given a random neuron id that can be up to 17-digits long (up to 10 quadrillion).  Currently, there is no list of neuron ids that have been created.  The result of this is that anyone who wants to get a list of all neuron ids must perform a query on all possible numbers up to 10 quadrillion to see if the neuron id exists.  This process could take years or decades to complete.

**Proposed Change**
I propose to submit a motion goverance proposal to the NNS to request that dfinity create and maintain a list of all neuron ids in existence (also known as indexing neuron ids).  This list should be accessible through the candid interface for the governance canister.

**Value Prosposition**
Indexing of neuron ids will allow any person with sufficient programming skills to return a list of all existing neuron ids, which will facilitate the ability to query the governance canister for all available data (creation date, ICP staked, Age Date, Dissolve Delay, etc.) for all neurons in existence.  This will allow for complete analysis of the NNS, including understanding breakdowns between dissolve delays, locked/dissolving, etc.  Without this change, a complete understanding of all neuron status of the NNS is not possible.

This solution will also allow ic.rocks and ICA's dashboard to more accurately display NNS-related data (resolving the known/unknown neuron issue).

**Argument Against**
My understanding is this change is not a heavy lift, although it would divert dfinity resources from other projects, most likely other projects associated with the NNS.  This change will also require the creation of paging within the governance canister.

**Next Steps**
I plan to solicit feedback via this forum post for a minimum of 7 days prior to deciding on whether to open the motion proposal within the NNS.

Further arguments against;

* Privacy.
* Front running.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-02-28 14:32:34 UTC | #3

Could you elaborate on how privacy and front running would be affected?  I don't want to make any assumptions.  Thanks!

-------------------------

Comfortable_Reply_56 | 2022-02-28 19:02:28 UTC | #4

I'm strongly in favor of this. I view it as a basic level of transparency that should be available on any blockchain. Not providing it makes the IC stand out in a negative way for newcomers. 

The privacy concern I don't understand. Could any one identifiable person's behavior on the blockchain be revealed? I don't see it.

Regarding front running: the limited information already available to the public gives some opportunity to front run, it's just limited and it's not clear to me that every single individual lacks the kind of insight indexing would contribute. More complete info to everyone on equal terms gives anyone a fair chance in the short term. Long term holders wouldn't be affected, as far as I can see.

I don't want to get too far off topic, but it seems to me like canister ownership should follow a similar pattern. There should be a ledger that can be consulted and 'replayed'.  This is relevant to neurons once we have ecdsa functionality and people can start trading neurons by having canisters hold them and trading the canisters.

-------------------------

Berto | 2022-02-28 20:36:26 UTC | #6

It is a good proposal, but it is not a priority right now.
Also, when the merge neuron(s) function becomes available, I think there will be far fewer IDs.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-02-28 23:32:05 UTC | #7

I think this should definitely be prioritized. 

Increased transparency on neuron voting power distribution brings additional trust to the voting system and new investors who want to understand the economics of their investment - just look at the argument and lack of trust in some of the commenters in the Compounding Maturity proposal arguments right now.

-------------------------

rossberg | 2022-03-01 07:17:33 UTC | #8

That would be the antithesis to a modern, [capability-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) access and security model (which I hope the IC will eventually be upgraded to) and hence a bad idea on the long run (and creating the wrong expectations) for a general-purpose system, underlying blockchain notwithstanding.

-------------------------

coin_master | 2022-03-01 07:36:37 UTC | #9

AFAIK you can now get the neurons ids but it's just a difficult task to do, and that leads to asymmetric information between people who know how to get this information and others who don't.
It should be either impossible to acquire this information for everyone or available to all.

-------------------------

Comfortable_Reply_56 | 2022-03-01 09:57:11 UTC | #10

Could you elaborate on the problem? I don't follow.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-01 12:49:54 UTC | #11

Thanks for your reply Berto.

The merge maturity function unfortunately won't resolve this issue.  It might make it marginally better, but we still won't be able to query all neurons.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-01 12:52:25 UTC | #12

I think coin_master did a good job explaining it.  As it is designed, it is very difficult to know that a neuron exists and therefore it is very difficult to have full transparency of the number of ICP on the NNS and how long it is staked for.  Without that transparency, investors can't make fully informed decisions and the NNS participants can not make fully informed tokenomic decisions.  The difficulty of knowing all neurons is so difficult that I do not think anyone has accomplished it (Norton Wang for ic.rocks has gotten the closest, but still lacks about 20% of voting power visibility).

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2022-03-01 21:09:53 UTC | #13

This can only lead to more transparency and trust within the community, therefore I'm in support.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-01 21:13:42 UTC | #14

I'm all for it, more transparency is needed

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-01 21:20:26 UTC | #15

This proposal enables transparency for measuring the health of the IC ecosystem while still maintaining appropriate level of anonymity of end users.  I am in support.

-------------------------

rossberg | 2022-03-03 10:38:32 UTC | #16

@Comfortable_Reply_56, in a capability-based (or object capability) system, accessing some entity, like a canister, is only possible if you are explicitly _given_ a reference to it. Under that approach, access is controlled by limiting where references are passed instead of trying to check "callers" after the fact. This is a less brittle and more composable way to achieve security and privacy, among other things (see Wikipedia). Of course, the essential prerequisite is that references cannot be forged or "discovered" unless explicitly published.

For example, not every auxiliary canister spawned by a dapp is meant to be accessible to the general public. Instead of necessitating defensive programming to work around leaking them globally and protect their invariants, it should be possible to keep canisters private. It's just the well-known concept of encapsulation.

Transparency is a relevant value, I agree, but so are security, privacy, encapsulation, and other such properties. The IC is much more general-purpose than a run-of-the-mill blockchain 2.0 and its vision requires a less naive approach to system design. Privacy is an important part of that vision (with the plan to employ SEV in the future). When there are competing properties, you want to think very carefully which ones you want to throw out the window. Even if they do not matter right now, you might never get them back.

Generally speaking, public visibility and accessibility simply is the wrong default in a complex system with no trust.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2022-03-03 18:42:54 UTC | #17

Thanks for this explanation - inclined to agree that in general, public visibility and accessibility is the wrong default.

That said, neurons are a very special case, I'd contend, as they're responsible for the governance of the IC itself. And just as we need to ensure the technical security of the IC, we also need to ensure the "governance security" of the IC, which I think requires neuron transparency.

Perhaps foremost, we need to ensure that the IC is safe from the risk of governance capture. This requires understanding not only where ICP is concentrated, but also where liquid voting power is concentrated. Since NNS votes can pass with as little as 3% absolute support, and even very small neurons can garner a lot of liquid voting power through followers, I think we need to be vigilant to make sure governance is secure on the IC.

Indexing neurons seems like a baseline requirement to monitor key governance metrics relating to decentralization and safety against the risk of governance capture. Unless there's a capability-based way of monitoring these metrics, I think it's worth making an exception to the capability-based model when it comes to neurons.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-07 15:35:28 UTC | #18

This forum topic has been open for a week and, per the original post, I plan to move it forward as a motion proposal.  I appreciate all the feedback and discussion!  Below is the intended language of the motion proposal.

----TITLE-------
Motion Proposal for NNS Neuron ID Indexing



---- SUMMARY ---------
## Objective

This motion proposal is to request Dfinity to prioritize creating an index or list of all neuron ID values, accessible through the Candid Interface.

## Background

A newly created neuron is given a random neuron id that can be up to 17-digits long (up to 10 quadrillion). Currently, there is no list of neuron IDs that have been created. The result of this is that it is impractical for any person or entity to know of all neurons created on the NNS, significantly hampering transparency into the NNS.

# Why this is important

Transparency into the NNS is vital for understanding governance and investor behavior.  It is important to know: how many ICP are staked in the NNS and what the staking behavior is in order for governance participants and investors to make informed decisions.  A failure to provide transparency could lead to mistrust of the NNS and dissuade potential investments into the Internet Computer.

## Community conversation

This topic was discussed in the forum at: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-request-for-neuron-indexing/11183

The conversation focused on the perceived benefits of:
- Increased transparency into the NNS, including full awareness of how many ICP are staked, dissolve delay and age bonuses, recent voting behavior of all neurons.
- Increased trust in the NNS through transparency of voting power.
- Reduction in asymmetric information of the NNS.

The perceived risks of this change, per the forum dissccion are:
- Reduction in privacy for neuron holders
- Does not follow capability-based access

This proposal is live…[48491](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491).  Please go vote.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-03-08 01:29:53 UTC | #20

I'm pretty torn on this one.  When @rossberg has an opinion on this stuff it is usually really well thought through. I've disagreed on a couple of things like call_raw, but here I understand what he is getting at here.  It is totally legitimate to have a neuron and not actively vote. Actively voting pretty much reveals your neuron.  Does passive voting?

Would this be a better thing to incentivize?  Maybe a higher reward for self-revealing your neuron?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-08 02:28:23 UTC | #21

Maybe I’m missing something.  Why does active voting reveal a neuron?  Voting just reveals that a neuron ID voted and cast a certain number of votes, which may or may not be a summation of voting power via liquid democracy of the followers you may or may not have. Either way, I don’t understand how voting reveals identity.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-03-08 02:54:36 UTC | #22

You would know better than me. I was referring to existence more than identity. Does a follow vote register the neuron id in a public place. Kyle has some data from somewhere but I wasn’t sure if it had follow votes or just the active vote. Pardon my ignorance if I’m mistaken.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-08 11:46:41 UTC | #23

Oh ok.  I’m not aware that voting reveals identity of a neuron owner unless they are a registered known neuron.  The dashboard does reveal the vote of all known neurons because the last 100 votes of all neurons are exposed by the governance canister.  It is also possible to monitor voting progress on a proposal and you could even correlate a change in vote status with a change in votes cast.  However, there is no exposure of how many votes come from any specific neuron or what other neurons are following that neuron.  It would be highly inaccurate and/or misleading to assume a specific neuron has a specific voting power simply by seeing the total voting power change when that neuron cast a vote.  This is especially true for public neurons where there are a lot of people following multiple neurons.  The votes cast depend on order that the Followees cast their votes.  

I don’t think Kyle’s proposal poses any risk to revealing neuron owner identity from this perspective, but I’m still interested in learning more from other who might see something that I’m missing.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-08 04:27:23 UTC | #24

I support this proposal. I think it would be good for transparency. 

@Kyle_Langham if this proposal passes do you have an expectation for when you’d like to see the change implemented, or is this more like a general request to add to the roadmap?

This is the first time I’ve seen a feature request submitted through the NNS. I hope this proposal passes and I look forward to seeing how everything unfolds. Exciting stuff.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-03-08 10:42:27 UTC | #25

Since The Dfinity Foundation and the Internet Computer Association voted on the last governance proposals (belonging to the campaign of [Proposals to Increase Voting Participation on Governance Topics](/t/proposals-to-increase-voting-participation-on-governance-topics/10706)), will they vote on this governance proposal ? In case they won't, why did they vote on these last governance proposals ?

Regards

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-03-08 11:26:43 UTC | #26

@Roman 
They(dfinity foundation &ica) might not respond as to why.

 This is because if an interested party knows which proposals they will not vote on, it is fair game (as per rules set up) to only create such governance  proposals on which  foundation & ica will not vote on.

This will then cause the APY to increase for the rest of those who do vote on such governance proposals.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-03-08 12:28:22 UTC | #27

Totally. This is why they should vote on every governance proposals, or on none of them. Because if they don't vote on this last proposal, I will be able to explain the previous votings exclusively through a prosaic motivation : their own APY interests or maybe the ones of some third parties which did not accurately update their followees. I don't see such an interest as a thing necessarily bad, but again, if such considerations exist, they should vote on every proposals, because the lack of systematicity is problematic here.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-08 12:02:40 UTC | #28

Actively voting does not reveal your neuron id or make your neuron more easily found.  If it did this topic would be moot as a typical non-governance proposal gets greater than 99% voting participation.

The corollary of that is it is practically impossible to get a voter roll of any proposal.   It's currently unlikely that anyone could verify the vote totals of any proposal since so many neurons are unfound.  That fact should be reason enough, imo, for the community to support this motion.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-08 12:16:29 UTC | #29

I purposely didnt write an expectation into the proposal, but I hope this proposal passing would lead dfinity to prioritize it.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-08 12:24:49 UTC | #30

I acknowledge that. I guess I should probably be more direct. I think this is a very important proposal and I recommend being explicit in the expectation.

Coming from someone who works in an engineering organization; we get requests from our customers every day to integrate all sorts of capabilities and develop new features. Everything is a priority. If you tell me something is a priority but don’t stress how important and you leave it up to me then I’m probably going to just put it at the end of my list.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-08 14:53:54 UTC | #31

@diegop I didn't see anyone from Dfinity (that I recognize) comment prior to this proposal being submitted. Does Dfinity have a process for handling these types of proposals if they pass? Is it just simply added to the to-do list?

I only ask because I suspect we will see more of these proposals pop up; all of them with varying degrees of importance. Personally, I consider this one to be extremely import and would hope to see it implemented within the next year (if the proposal passes). However, I'm also aware that Dfinity has their hands full with a comprehensive roadmap for 2022 and early 2023.

Is there any additional information we could/should add to future proposals that would help Dfinity understand the community's need? Is it better to save that for follow-on discussions? Would it help to identify impacts before submitting a proposal?

These are just some thoughts that went through my head when I saw the proposal. If i'm overcomplicating it then I apologize.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-08 15:04:52 UTC | #32

I think we're moving a bit too quickly on this one without a deep exploration of @rossberg's major objection. Considering his objection is based on system-wide properties that must hold, I think it's unwise to move so fast on a single component without an understanding of the larger system we might be breaking.

Perhaps in the proposal we can include a deeper system analysis of the object capability model and what neuron indexing would do to our ability to implement that model.

I don't think we should decide to do this or not right now without this deeper dive into the object capability model.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-08 15:10:43 UTC | #33

I’m interested in an answer to this question too.  Nothing the community proposes is actionable by the community if it is related to code changes.  Hence, it would be helpful for feedback from Dfinity on the work process for getting them implemented.

There have been other community driven proposals in the past.  For example, proposal [38985](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) included discussion with @lara during deliberation and she responded with a tentative timeline of 2Q2022 at the earliest after the proposal was passed.  

I suspect most community driven proposals will work in a similar way.  Some will be harder to implement than others and Dfinity will likely need time to think about how long it will take to implement before they can respond.  I think it’s best to try to engage Dfinity in the discussion during deliberation.  There could be ways of making the proposal that enable easier implementation, so it would be good to get that feedback in advance.

This is another reason why I think Dfinity should be free to vote on governance proposals.  Some may be unrealistic to implement.  I also think if a proposal doesn’t pass the first time, that doesn’t mean it’s not worthy of multiple attempts.  I think it’s all about getting the details right so it can pass and sometimes that may require an iterative approach.  Of course, it helps when people provide feedback about what is objectionable about a given proposal so those issues can be addressed by the author of the proposal. 

I see this as a collaboration.  There will be push and pull from all sides on what the work process should be.  I suspect it will be difficult to settle on a known and documented work process for everything, but I definitely would appreciate feedback from Dfinity on this question.

I agree; but, I also think we could iron this out on the forums before the proposal is submitted. Otherwise, if a proposal passes on the NNS and Dfinity has not agreed to do that work, it might put people in awkward positions.

Sure. An iterative approach is great. I just think a lot of that work should be done on the forums beforehand. This way when the proposal is submitted all of the stakeholders have a better understanding of the impact.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-08 17:27:19 UTC | #35

Could someone explain the concern in layman's terms?  I'm struggling to comprehend how revealing the existence of an id would violate capability-based model.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-03-08 17:42:48 UTC | #36

One concern: Some neurons exist for the sole purpose of using the manage_neuorn topic to control a big chunky neuron.  So they maybe have one ICP in them and they mostly vote on manage neuron proposals.  Half the configured neurons need to vote and they are more of a record-keeping operation than an investment seeing to influence governance and/or trying to yield farm ICP maturity.

This is only relevant to the extent that there is not just one reason to create a neuron.  People may not want their management neurons indexed.  Is there a good reason for this? I'm not sure.  Your post clarified for me a couple of things about revealing neurons, so let me say a couple of things and you can tell me if they are true or not:

1. A neuron has an ID.
2. There is no way to tie a neuron ID to a Principal.
3. A neuron has an account(I send my top-ups to it) but there is no way to derive the account from the Neuron ID.
4. There is no way to see how a neuron voted(although I don't think this is true because I'm pretty sure I know which neurons voted against the ICDevs proposal and someone gave me that info.)  Where did they get it?  Did they have to query all known ids to see what their votes were? So having this index would let you query all votes for a proposal?

its not a witch hunt

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-03-08 20:23:58 UTC | #38

It came unrequested! I was surprised it was queryable. I think it was only because some of the votes were the sequential seed neurons.  It is actually maybe a great example of why one wouldn't want them indexed.

-------------------------

Jan | 2022-03-08 21:30:54 UTC | #39

The foundation is going to vote in favour of this proposal because this adds transparency on the NNS and addresses the current unsatisfactory situation where a lot of information about a neuron can be retrieved given the ID of a neuron. In particular, the foundation acknowledges the need for privacy and will make a follow-up motion proposal regarding which properties of a neuron should be private, which one should be public, and also about giving a neuron holder a choice on that. For instance, the voting history of a neuron should probably be private by default (which it is currently not), but visible for neurons that are listed as a followee option.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-08 23:10:04 UTC | #40

I think this is a fantastic idea.  It seems reasonable that vote history should be private by default and that public and/or registered known neurons are the most likely neurons to want/need to make their voting history public.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2022-03-09 01:12:29 UTC | #41

can you elaborate a bit around the internal discusssion of @rossberg points made earlier?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-09 02:36:08 UTC | #42

1. I believe it to be true that every neuron has a unique id, although I would need Dfinity to veridy this.
2. I know of no way to tie a neuron id to its owners' Principle ID for neurons created after Genesis.  For Genesis neurons, I believe it is possible because I remember seeing them tied together on ic.rocks.
3. This is correct as far as I know.  However a createdOn datetime is recorded when a neuron is created.  I wonder if it's possible to use that datetime and the ICP transaction history to figure out the account number feeding the ICP to the new neuron... seems like that might be possible.
4.  Currently the governance canister contains the voting history for recent proposals for each neuron.  You can see this on the governance tab of the ICA dashboard (also accessible via the API for the dashboard).  Of course, this is only true for known neuron ids (which is mostly genesis neurons)

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-03-09 02:52:40 UTC | #43

Probably a conversation for another day, but i think theres a good argument that recent voting history should be mandatory public.  It would allow anyone to conduct a "recount" of any recent proposal and provide a second verification beyond the nns code audit.   The real life example would be the equivalent of allowing hand recounts in democratic elections where the vote tally is close or there is reasonable doubt regarding the operation of a voting machine.  

I think there are steps we could take to both protect privacy of neuron holders and increase transparency of neurons themselves.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-09 03:42:08 UTC | #44

Yeah, that’s a good point.  I do hope there is further discussion on these ideas.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-09 14:50:54 UTC | #45

I thought DFINITY was going to abstain from voting on governance proposals. DFINITY and the ICA have been voting on multiple governance proposals recently. What has changed? Did DFINITY/ICA announce this change?

-------------------------

Jan | 2022-03-09 17:03:10 UTC | #46

The foundation considers a motion proposal by the community a mandate to work on a topic and feed that topic into the roadmap process. As part of that process, a topic is first scoped, meaning it is investigated what the topic actually entails and how it can be realised. Part of that scoping is a conversion on this forum and then eventually another motion proposal to agree on the scope. We are  preparing a blog post on how the foundation aims to manage the roadmap and how to work with the community on the roadmap and individual features such as working groups etc. So please bear with us for a bit for a better answer. Thanks!

@diegop @Kyle_Langham 

The work you've done producing visibility into DFINITY neurons and voting power is amazing, and I want to thank you for this.

Any update on how or when this Neuron Indexing Proposal work (which passed last month on the NNS) might fit into the DFINITY roadmap for the next few quarters?

Hi all, (for context, I am a researcher in the NNS team) 

Please know that this feature is on the NNS team todo list. 
As we are at the last mile of the SNS feature, which is the big feature scheduled for the Carbon milestone, the NNS team is focused on shipping the SNS. We might thus only get to the neuron list afterwards. 
I hope that makes sense. Please let us know if you have more questions!

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-05-13 12:09:47 UTC | #53

No worries on my part... I believe the SNS is a more important priority.

The new neuron charts on the dashboard (and the governance canister capturing that data) provides a lot of value in the meantime.

Thanks for the update!

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-02-25 08:55:19 UTC | #54

I want to bring up the importance of this feature, as I believe that both:

1) The release of all investor, seed and team neuron addresses (without doxxing individuals)
2) Adding neuron indexing

would dispel much of the concerns around decentralization and what happened at genesis.

To be fair, we are now at 9 months since the “SNS last mile” described above.

I understand this is a hard feature to prioritize, but recent events such as the Twitter space and public critiques have highlighted the lack of transparency around historical neuron data that is publicly accessible.

If the DFINITY team is too busy/priorities are elsewhere, maybe someone close to the code can outline a rough set features required to implement neuron indexing.

Also, I’d happily chip in some ICP or time to make this happen.

Thanks for raising and pointing out the importance of this again @justmythoughts.
We will consider this in the next roadmap planning!

Hi @lara, I wanted to check in on this feature and if there's any appetite/bandwidth to implement it in 2024.

I've started a poll as an informal check-in to see where people are now at almost 2 years after the passing of the initial governance proposal.

Hi @justmythoughts and thanks for tagging!

We don't have a complete plan for the whole year yet so I can't make concrete promise, but indeed we currently think that this is something that we would like to tackle this year as it has come up in different contexts.

Just one list will not suffice. It's necessary to preserve all neuron votes in a manner similar to the transactions of ICRC1 SNS tokens with archive canisters. It would also be beneficial to record the time when a neuron cast its vote. Additionally, for a comprehensive understanding of the vote distribution, a list of followings would be helpful. In any event, this information will be indirectly accessible, provided there's a list of neurons and their voting times.

@alexander Since you're super passionate about this subject I thought you'd be a good person to ask about this. I've been doing some reading about things like MACI(https://maci.pse.dev/) that attempt to combat collusion in the opposite way of transparency by making it impossible to even prove your own vote.

Can you give the pros and cons of the two approaches and how the IC setup may change some of the assumptions of the MACI maxis?  I'm for transparency in a liquid democracy set up because I think it helps keep the power brokers in check and accountable, but does the transparency make them bribeable? In some ways? (Maybe not the problem we have now, but does correcting for one open up the possibility of the other?)  These are all open questions and I only have limited understanding of all the dynamics at work.
