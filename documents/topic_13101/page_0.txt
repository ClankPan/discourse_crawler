Hi All,

I had planned on merging a certain % of my liquid ICP into an 8 year neuron and a certain % of my liquid ICP into a 6 month neuron. After attempting to merge the % into the 8 year neuron, I got an error message (see below) so tried again twice more. I then noticed that despite the error message the merge actually did go through, so in fact I staked 3x as much as I intended into an 8 year neuron. This is a pretty bad form. Please fix it.

Yes, that is bad.  Looking into it.  We hope to get rid of a great deal of tech debt with the svelte rewrite, which is very close to being ready, but if there is a quick fix we can make for the above we will release it.
