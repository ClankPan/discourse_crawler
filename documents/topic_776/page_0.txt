What does this message mean?
`IC0502: Canister ic:F5ECD58694FEA0AFD3 trapped: unreachable`

Maybe it has something to do with [this](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/basic-concepts.html#_document_unreachable_code_paths)?

Hmm... that's strange.
The code which causes this error message is Enzo's `motoko-qr`, so I believe it should work fine.

what did you execute it with, would be interested to try to recreate this

There is a function called `encode` on the `QR` actor.
```
        val resp = actor.encode(
            Version_3.Version(BigInteger.ONE),
            ErrorCorrection_3.H,
            Mode_3.Alphanumeric,
            "Hello, world!"
        )
```

It now makes sense. There are some cases when Enzo throws `unreachable` in this code. 

Thank you, @cryptoschindler
