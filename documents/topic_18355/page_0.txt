Hi @ZenVoich 

I got errors after installing the "[motoko-hash-map](https://github.com/ZhenyaUsenko/motoko-hash-map)" using Mops.

Hi @rncrmn, thanks for reporting the problem!

This seems to be due to the fact that we installed a package with one name and then renamed it.

If you run `mops install` it should start working.

I will also update that post of mine...

Thank you, unfortunately it doesn't work :frowning_face:

I do revert it to its original name "motoko-hash-map" and run the command "mops install" and I also do the "Motoko: restart language server" and still got the same issue.

Hi @ZenVoich 

I tried the base and I get the same error :frowning_face:

Hello everyone,

I just released a patch to the Motoko VS Code extension (0.8.4) which might fix some of these issues (or at least make it easier to debug what's happening). 

You can find detailed logs in the "Output" tab after selecting "Motoko Language Server" from the dropdown, which will contain additional error details that could narrow down the underlying issue. 

![Screenshot 2023-02-02 at 11.49.49 AM|690x151](upload://9N6MMnlFZwtWlYybKh3iqsgyEY.png)

Also, in case this helps someone, make sure to double-check that you ran `npm i -g ic-mops` (rather than `npm i -g mops`, which is a different npm package). 

I'll keep an eye on this forum topic in case it's possible to fix this on the VS Code side of things. 

Cheers!
