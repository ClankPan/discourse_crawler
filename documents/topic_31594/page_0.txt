### Benefits of Using DCA:

1. **Lower Average Cost:** The average cost per Bitcoin is $36,339.91, which is significantly lower than the peak prices during the investment period.
2. **Mitigated Risk:** By spreading the investment over 15 months, the investor reduces the risk of investing a large amount just before a market downturn.
3. **Profit in Recovery:** As the market recovers, the value of the accumulated Bitcoin increases. In this case, the portfolio value is $8,485.74 after a total investment of $4,500, resulting in a profit of $3,985.74.
4. **Reduced Emotional Impact:** DCA helps the investor avoid emotional decisions and market timing, which can often lead to poor investment choices.
5. **Consistent Investment:** Encourages disciplined and consistent investing habits, making it easier for investors to stay committed to their long-term goals.
