The NNS community did move the cheese quite a bit ( including the head spinning staked icp/ staked maturity/maturity bit). 

But this is like saying someone missed all the amendments from 1776 , woke up in 2022 and thought that certain unsavory aspects (i.e. what the 13 amendment specifically prohibits) of our (US) history were still valid.

Havent we provided them with enough time to see that the times have changed? What are the specific guard-rails that we must adhere to ensure that they ARE cut , if they dont vote , after the network has stabilized. What is the measure of network stability would be acceptable?

its actually good no? to incentivize new active neuron, increase network adoption further decentralization?
[/quote]

Of course it is.  And it is still incentivized.  We can argue whether 20% + less inflation = 40% + more inflation if we want, but it is incredibly disingenuous to say that I'm trying to attack small retail #8yeargang (of which I am one). I am more interested in my ICP being worth 4x more dollars each than having an extra 20% of them this year.  You are completely failing to acknowledge second-order effects of less inflation.  We can argue and analyze those effects with real data only if we acknowledge that they exist.

I would not have put this forward if I didn't think there was a large set of potential future universes where paying #8yeargang (relatively)less rewards (but inactive whales much much less rewards) resulted in a higher token price because most of the reduced inflation comes at the expense of inactive voters.  @Kyle_Langham could probably speak more to the magnitudes of this, but I would think that if we have 233M Circulating, and we cut the total issued rewards by 40M over the next year that it *might* have a positive impact on price and could have a **significant** impact on price.

This is a worthwhile consideration, imo. But also imo ,defending someone because they are ignorant about the current rules is not. 

Secondly as i alluded to earlier, some of the reduced inflation will come because of this staked maturity/staked icp/maturity.

I am in favor of action 1 because i think it will generally aid the inflation issue even more.

The initial ecosystem of investors in Dfinity. Many worked at DFINITY, many used to work at dfinity and are still friendly with the ecosystem, many are seed/angel investors with long-term positive views of the project as long as they feel they are being given a fair shake.  Have you been paying attention to turnover at the foundation at all? Most folks who have left have gone to continue working on the tech elsewhere and build up the ecosystem(this is good for ICP!).  But that is a fragile thing and implying that people that who were relying on the liquid democracy to work as advertised are somehow not entitled to the then advertised rewards seems like a bad externality to have in the ecosystem.  I don't thing this proposal builds up or protects those inactive voters at all, but I've seen other sentiments that seem to imply that that support in the past is now worthless and I feel that it still has significant value.  We're fine to disagree on that point, but we do disagree.

I think that it was a mistake as well. Fwiw this was pointed out BEFORE the proposal passed in several different venues including reddit.

That said, essentially what we are trying to do here is reduce the 40% inflated return down to 20% for the active voter; while still handicapping the passive participant. This will be an improvement on inflation.

After 48623 is implemented, compounding automatically will be increased staked maturity NOT newly minted ICP. BEFORE 48623, yes, it's newly minted ICP.


IF this proposal does NOT pass:

we will have 40% for active voters , after 48623 , there will be increased staked maturity(but not increased ICP); assuming that most 8years will opt for auto-compounding.

It would be nice to see more discussion about how to advance decentralization.  The only thing that has worked so far is proposal weights and separating a proposal topic from All Topics.  At this time I cannot see anything else being effective and that is because every neuron was configured with a default followee and because of the existence of the All Topics “catch all”.  No other idea has surfaced yet to stimulate decentralization.  

I want to get past these discussions about how to prevent spam and move toward discussions of how and when decentralization will continue to occur.  I think adequate solutions to spam have surfaced and need to be implemented and we need to focus on what decentralization means and how it will be achieved.

I’m not at all advocating for quick decentralization.  We are not ready.  However, the transition toward decentralization needs to be more central to the community discussion about tokenomics incentives in my opinion.

The idea I have is to calculate the "following score" of each neuron and detect the ultimate exposure to the NNS. If you don't vote manually than your bonus is affected by this score(magnitudes to be discussed).  So If I follow dfinity only and that means I have like 99% overlap on a category with the rest the NNS then I'm going to have my bonus negatively affected.  If I follow 5 neurons who each are independent then I have much less overlap and will get a higher bonus.  Some categories aren't ready for it (exchange rate), but at some point we'll really need and want it for even that category as many people keeping an eye on the exchange rate is better than just dfinity.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-05-18 13:01:37 UTC | #137

Since 01APR we know that 57.8% of the governance rewards have remained as accumulated maturity and 42.3% has been either merged maturity or spawned neurons.

Let's assume all governance rewards are currently going to voting members and 50% of the vp is voting.  If this proposal were to go through, the rewards to voting participants would decrease by half.  Let's also assume that the ratio of accumulating maturity stays the same if this proposal is enacted.  That would mean we go from 48k in daily ICP that is either merged maturity or spawned neurons to 24k.

We can't know for sure how much of the dispersed governance rewards is spawned neurons vs. merged maturity until neuron indexing is implemented, however back in March I estimated that 70% of the rewards were being spawned as neurons based on known neurons (it was a rough estimate that required many assumptions).  If we use that 70% number, then I would guess that this proposal (should it be enacted) would decrease amount of ICP being added to the circulating supply by ~17k a day (500k a month).  That's a rather large decrease and I would guess would have a positive effect on the price of ICP.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-18 14:07:18 UTC | #138

If 48623 is implemented prior to this proposal, all of ICP calculations will change. 

For some time, there will be little, IF ANY, increase to newly minted ICP. Depending on exactly how circulating supply is calculated, i am also nearly sure that there will be little, IF ANY, increase of the circulating supply.

Here's the reasoning: when 48623 is implemented:

(A) Any disbursement of maturity will first occur from the staked ICP ALREADY in the neuron. Clearly no new ICP will be minted until the staked ICP in the neuron is exhausted. 

(B) Any auto-componding of maturity will cause staked maturity to increase; but NOT circulating supply of ICP.

I have reason to believe that 48623 has higher priority within dfinity than any other improvements to tokenomics; because it has the most drastic impact on the circulating supply.

So, if the goal is to ONLY reduce the increase of circulating supply due to maturity earnings in neurons, then 48623 does a good job in the short term. 

However, in addition to that, Action 1 reduces the amount of staked maturity / maturity for active voters as opposed to what staked maturity/maturity that they are getting now (20% as opposed to 40%).

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-05-19 08:41:45 UTC | #139

From my perspective it would make sense to separate the topic of preventing spam vs the size of the overall reward pool (and whether we should adjust/reduce it). 

As you rightly describe, after implementing the proposal of this thread, one could use spam proposals to effectively half the size of the daily reward pool. Thus implementing a spam prevention change would lead to a set-up in which spam proposals will have a big impact on the overall tokenomics of the IC, which should not be the case.

Sheesh. Hats of to you. You have some extreme patience. Makes me appreciate your community presence all the more.

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-05-19 09:04:15 UTC | #141

spam prevention and the rewards mechanism are two completely different things. Although they directly influence one another its best to solve each one with closed loop systems that don't expand infinitely in some form (e.g infinite catch errors or rewards per click).

Once the reward mechanism is fleshed out and bullet proof it will stop 90 percent of all spam. However the remaining 10 percent of spam must still be solved for. A human in the loop must exist for the remaining spam, we cannot solve for it programmatically without affecting valid proposals in some way. 

Please check out this summary for a quick review of current events and a breakdown of NNS challenges.

I keep coming back to spam prevention either requiring 100% participation or equal weighting across the board.  This problem is a head scratcher.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-05-19 20:52:48 UTC | #143

This could be easily gamed, I also dont see why stakers should be penalized if they want to support named neurons known to always vote in the best interest of the network.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-05-20 06:05:50 UTC | #144

Also, about action 1, we have to consider that, given the discussion on the internet identity vulnerability, a lot of people have set up their neurons to follow one neuron (even of theirs sometimes) just to avoid to authenticate too much and then avoid the 30 minutes window of attackability that Timo talked about : 

[quote="timo, post:96, topic:9144"]
Now, in some further detail, II actually tries to improve over wallets like MetaMask. Where those wallets store key material permanently on disk (at least encrypted), II doesn’t. II only creates session keys that are valid for 30 min. The permanent keys are inside the biometric sensor or Yubikey. That is an improvement because it shortens the attack window for certain attacks.
[/quote]

So we can’t force these people to authenticate to manually vote and earn maximum voting rewards. Because even an omniscient person could use the possibility of following a neuron just to secure his/her ICP.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-05-20 12:18:12 UTC | #145

Yes I think this is a fair point, i.e. we should consider whether we can separate more firmly the spam prevention from the actual voting & their rewards. 

Btw: Apart from the (unfortunately big) side-effect I found your proposal quite elegant.

skilesare | 2022-05-20 12:05:40 UTC | #147

As an addendum to Action 1, I'd propose the following for discussion:

Instead of having the 'forfeited' inflation not be minted, have it minted to some kind of quadratic funding mechanism like bitcoin uses that can deploy that ICP to projects in dao-based grant cycles.  To offset the incentive to spam to fund the fund, DFINITY can daily propose a governance proposal to award the 'non-active' voting pool to the funding DAO.  One proposal a day offsets most of the skew. I don't think it can be completely eliminated while we have weighting.  We'd need to figure out the exact process for submitting to this fund, but with what gitcoin has done I think there is probably a good bit of prior art.  It also doesn't have to be a developer fund, but I think that building out infrastructure for the network is something that would find broad alignment.  Open to other suggestions.

I've tried to engage in good faith here, but I'm about at the end my rope with you.  Your arguments are in bad faith and you're making affirmative statements rooted in some false narrative you have in your head.

In trying to align the IC for maximum utility because I think that will drive value.  I'm absolutely considering all participants and considering what keeps them engaged and working for the network. If you are not then you are acting in bad faith and have some delusion that excluding participants makes the network stronger.

The community fund(of which we know very little at this point) is absolutely a valid discussion point for this topic, but layering on socialism and totalitarianism is, again, in bad faith.  The community fund, once we know the full extent, is likely the best target here.  I'm a big fan of the quadratic funding mechanism put forth by gitcoin and I think it increases optionality, exposure to positive black swans, and gives those with fewer resources but better ideas a leveler playing field to succeed. If the community fund is going to implement something like that then I'm all for it.  If it is going to distribute purely on monetary strength I'm less bullish, but it would still be better than nothing. 

My personal opinion is that I have far more to gain from incentives going into development for the next couple of years than I do from an increased percentage of rewards. You're welcome to argue with that point if you can do so from a position of good faith.

It is 100% within the mission of ICDevs.org to promote developers and to work toward providing resources to advance the tools and technologies they have to work with.  I'll not apologize at all for doing so.  I am in no way advocating that the ICP should be allocated to the ICDevs organization, although I would assume that we would be helping developers apply and execute against grants from the funds and that would be a successful execution of the mission.

My only interest in whales and their engagement in the network is short-term until the network reaches adequate enough decentralization to not need the financial stability that their passive stake currently provides the network.  The actual execution of the IC is not yet equal to the ideal of the IC, and ignoring this point is asking for the experiment to be attacked and destroyed by those seeking solely self-serving profit.

ICDevs.org has almost 100% of our assets in an 8-year staked neuron and demands from our board that 66% of every inflow must go into an 8-year staked neuron. We are 100% aligned with the long-term well-being of the network and to state otherwise is to do so in bad faith.

I'm not a fan of putting words in people's mouths, but I don't think I'm crossing a line by saying that almost without exception any #dfinitycore or #activewhale would at worst agree that this issue is worth discussing in good faith to determine why it is/isn't a good solution and using that data as an input to a new and better solution....and I think you'd be shocked at how many might think it should actually be executed in some form.  If you feel you have data or a good faith argument as to why it should be set aside and a different direction taken then please offer it..again in good faith. Your current approach is doing nothing but running valid contributors off who may have the perfect solution for spam vs incentivization with your bad faith and hostile attitude.

To put it another way, your current approach is a net negative to the value of ICP and the IC network and unless you can change the way you engage with others, we'd all be better off if you didn't contribute. I appreciate your passion and share some of the underlying themes of what you are saying. I'd love to have a good-faith discussion with you.

Lol! If you really pour over @skilesare 's history, you would actually see how embedded he is into the whole economics front.

How he finds time to sleep in between communicating the common good, leading a challenging project at Origyn and actively contributing to open source is a puzzle for me.

I have had my share of disagreements publicly with some of his thoughts. But good faith of @skilesare is something that i dont even pause to question.
