Dear all,

We recently discovered a memory leak in the BTreeMap implementation of [@dfinity/stable-structures](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures), which could lead to consuming an excessive amount of memory. This is a moderate severity security issue and we recommend updating to version 0.6.4. Please see the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/security/advisories/GHSA-3rcq-39xp-7xjp) for more details.

We encourage the ICP community to report any new issues or bugs found responsibly. Please refer to the [Bug Bounty](https://dfinity.org/bug-bounty/) program for more information.

Please reach out to us in this thread or privately if you have any questions.
