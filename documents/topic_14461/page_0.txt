Proposal co-sponsors: @justmythoughts, @wpb, @Zane

## Proposal

We propose that DFINITY implement proposals [55651 - Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) and [38985 - Enable Manual Voting throughout the Entire Voting Period](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) before implementing proposal [48623 - Compounding Maturity Proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623).

<br/>


## Prioritizing Decentralization of the IC over Tax Optimization

A very important driver for wanting to prioritize proposals 55651 and 38985 over 48623 is that they will have a bigger impact on the decentralization of the IC. Proposal 55651 seeks to ensure that voting rewards are distributed to neurons whose owners meet a minimum standard of active participation, which is simply to confirm their Followee selections every 6 months, instead of neurons that were configured by default to follow DFINITY at genesis. Proposal 38985 seeks to allow all neurons owners to vote manually at any time during the Voting Period even if their Followee(s) has already voted. Both of these proposals are directly aligned with the ethos of active and decentralized NNS governance and the purpose of the tokenomics incentives. Proposal 48623 seeks to help neuron owners avoid incurring a tax burden. In the process of addressing this issue, the changes will also add a lot of new voting power to the NNS from ICP that is currently sitting in large genesis neurons as maturity and it will influence ICP price with the modulation function. These are not the primary objectives of NNS governance and tokenomics incentives. Hence, prioritization of proposals 55651 and 38985 over proposal 48623 seems to be more closely aligned with governance objectives at this time.

<br/>

## Background

Over the past year, the NNS voting community has passed many proposals related to the NNS, including:

**Dashboard NNS Proposal Links** - (Note the % are out of those who voted, not total staked voting power)

* [38985] [Enable Manual Voting throughout the Entire Voting Period](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) (Passed 2022-01-11 with 91% approval)

* [55651] [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) (Passed 2022-04-24 with 90% approval)

* [48491] [Motion Proposal for NNS Neuron ID Indexing](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491) (Passed 2022-03-12 with 74% approval)

* [48623] [Compounding Maturity Proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) (Passed 2022-03-14 with 51% approval)

<br/>

Even though Compounding Maturity Proposal was, and still is one of the most controversial and close governance proposal votes to pass the NNS (51% approval vs. 49% reject), the DFINITY foundation has chosen to [prioritize and deliver this proposal first](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387).

Adding on, the @jwiegley, the original DFINITY engineer who was put in charge of the [original Compounding Maturity Proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011), has since left DFINITY and publicly come out against the implementation of this proposal on the developer forums.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387/30

<br/>

## Why should I pass this as a voter, isn't this micromanagement?

First off, no organization, team, or employee works well being micro-managed, and most NNS voters believe in the vision and capability of DFINITY to deliver on their roadmap, as they have proven the ability to do so (good job DFINITY! :tada: ).

However, when a proposal driven and passed by the voters passes the NNS, there is some expectation that this proposal is eventually worked on, but there is currently no mechanism or guarantee that DFINITY will actually implement that proposal.

What voters see right now is that the Compounding Maturity proposal, which was the top priority of the head of DFINITY, is being prioritized in front of other proposals that passed earlier and with much higher approval. In fact, those other proposals have not even been given places on the roadmap.

In fact, 7 out of all 8 of @dominicwilliams replies on these forums until now have been with respect to the Compounding Maturity Proposal https://forum.dfinity.org/u/dominicwilliams/activity

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/110

<br/>

If the implementation of proposals passed by the NNS is truly just dependent on "top down C-suite level management", and decision making that puts their own priorities first over those of the voters, it actually shows that the NNS is not decentralized. In fact, **all this shows that we are all operating under the facade of a decentralized vote**.

This has even larger implications in the value of your ICP as a governance token - is it just worth the compute cycles from burning, or does your voting power actually matter? Can your vote actually drive DFINITY to implement and deliver any proposal, especially one that passed the NNS 6 months ago by a wide approval margin?

<br/>

## What we're asking the governing body

This will not be something that we in the community expect the voters to do often. We don't want to push DFINITY to context switch on a whim, or to micro-manage them as stated before -> that would kill innovation and their vision.

In this case, we're asking voters in the community to push back on the internal prioritization of a highly controversial proposal, criticized by its original implementer, that barely passed the NNS, and has been dictated and driven by a single person from the very start.

We're asking voters to publicly say that they want DFINITY to take proposals that the IC governing body has passed convincingly, and to prioritize that work in the DFINITY roadmap.

We're asking voters to publicly push DFINITY to take the following into account when they prioritize proposals:

* The chronological order in which they were passed

* The approval percentage associated with the NNS vote

* The backwards-compatibility of the change, and the friction/pushback that it would cause within the community.

<br/>

## Timeline

* (1 week) Community reviews comments, asks questions, provides actionable feedback
* Community votes to accept or reject the proposal

John just added some context to proposal 48623:

*1. Since my disagreement was not moral, but merely technical, I had no issue with implementing it against my objections. As a principal engineer working in that area of the product, it was my responsibility to execute the designs of my CTO and CEO.*
*2. The opinion I formed is that the community is very divided on this matter, and so DFINITY should proceed with caution.*
*3. No, I did not have that authority. I was able to give feedback on the design at all levels, but the executive decision was not in my hands.*

Dfinity have voted NO to a proposal to downgrade the governance weight back to 1.  The proposal did not pass as they wanted.  Then, they change idea and decided to make a proposal to bring the weight down back to 1, the exact same as the one they put down before.  
If they can do this, I think the proposal 48623 should be suspended and, after the implementation of those 2 proposals 55651 and 38985, we should have a new vote for proposal 48623. 
It is really sad thing that someone have the job task to make a proposal that he himself qualify as a **very bad idea**, especially when he is an important engineer at Dfinity at the time.
Now knowing what we know now,  there are huge chances proposal 48623 would have not pass, and by much.
John is someone we all trust and have a huge credibilty.  He is also a gentleman and a very loyal person, thus could share his personal view at the time.  I am convinced many voters have voted YES because it was proposed by John.

Just asking here if some other also think the proposal 48623 should be suspended and have a new vote later on?

[/quote]

Indefinite suspension of 48623, a proposal that was already passed by the community, is **not** in the context of this proposal or discussion. 

Yes, the co-sponsors of this proposal are aware that work on 48623 has been ongoing, as mentioned here https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387. This proposal simply aims to ensure that 55651 & 38985 are prioritized, implemented, and delivered **before** continued work on 48623.

While your points are 100% valid discussion points, they should be brought up in a separate post/thread, as this proposal is more focused towards ensuring that broadly supported community passed proposals receive the same urgency and priority as those driven by the top-level executives at DFINITY.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-22 03:18:39 UTC | #6

I agree with the response provided by @justmythoughts.  This proposal is not about revisiting the merits of proposal 48623.  In my mind, that proposal was properly deliberated and adopted.  I am not opposed to that proposal being implemented in due time.  My objective in co-sponsoring this proposal is simply to emphasize that the priority of 55651 and 38985 should be higher than 48623.  Hence, I want to ensure that the scope of this proposal is not going to expand beyond our original intent.

Thanks for clarifying.  I did not realized the "before 48623" which I highly support.
I am 100% in agreement with all your proposal.

I do not have problem either with proposal 48623 with the technical.  My problems with 48623 are these:
1- Was proposed by someone who taught it was a very bad idea, then misleading the community
2- Make people believing the proposal is relieving the burden of taxes
3- As everyone can see now, it makes the NNS reward system much more complicated and not attractive for new investors, then working against the initial goal of 90% of ICP being locked.

I truly understand this is another topic that should be addressed in another thread.  Will see how this proposal end up first.

Thanks for everything you do, being so important, for this ecosystem.

I think this underscores how important it is to open up the IC github repo to external contributions. That way, community members can implement the proposal themselves. I believe Internet Identity has already been opened.

Actually, can't community members technically fork the repo, make their local changes, build the replica, and create the necessary "Update Subnet Replica Version" proposals themselves, even before the github is open to PRs?

@diegop Do you happen to know the latest on that effort?

alejandrade | 2022-07-22 12:44:05 UTC | #9

I’m going to vote no for this because I think we should revert anything that forces people to need to pay attention.

This is borderline stealing

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-22 13:07:30 UTC | #10

I agree with the sentiment, the reasons why I personally decided to go ahead with this proposal are 2:

1) As much as I dislike 48623 it has been approved by the NNS, deliberating it again might end up with a different outcome but I believe it'd put us on a slippery slope, if a passed proposal can be questioned then nothing is really "approved"

2) Even if 48623 had passed with 100% VP, it still doesn't make sense in my opinion to prioritize it over the other NNS related pending proposals, we just had to vote on a temp fix for spam cause the NNS team didn't have time to work on anything due to SNS taking up resouces, but for some reason 48623, which was proposed by Dom coincidentally, can be worked on despite not providing any significant benefits to the governance system. Furthermore I believe Dfinity has provided conflicting infos on the matter as you can read in my post:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387/14?u=zane

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-22 13:08:55 UTC | #11

So asking stakers to press a button every couple months is stealing, but taking away a % of my maturity due to circumastances outside my control and which already impact me negatively is fine?

This is exactly what Dfinity just did with the governance weight.  The first proposal did  not pass (they voted No) and they submitted a new one last week to reverse the rejected proposal.  So they have proven that a pass proposal is never really approved.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-22 16:03:01 UTC | #13

Why would you not want people to pay attention?  The whole point of the tokenomics is to incentivize people to pay attention and participate in governance.  Anyone who DYOR on NNS governance and ICP tokenomics before they create a neuron will know this expectation.  

Community leaders really should be careful about characterizing tokenomics changes as stealing.  It can leave false impressions to new participants in our governance system.  The NNS is intentionally designed to be mutable and people who create neurons need to know and understand this fact.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-26 03:37:11 UTC | #14

@diegop @bjoernek 

I think DFINITY has always done a great job of explaining why the organization votes for or against governance proposals.  In this particular case, no matter which way the foundation votes, will you please clarify in your response how community led proposals that are Adopted will be prioritized and resourced for implementation by DFINITY?  

If case DFINITY is evolving to believe that they should not be responsible for implementation of community led proposals, which I think can be a reasonable outcome, then will you please provide guidance that helps the community understand how to submit proposals that include code that will be implemented if they are Adopted?  This would be similar to how instructions were provided for how to submit a governance proposal late last year.  I hope there is a step in that process in which DFINITY will perform a code review to validate that community generated code changes are safe for release.  I think this would be a big step to helping the community understand expectations.  We are all learning together and your clarification on this matter would be greatly appreciated.  

Also, we were very intentional about trying to comply with the [Voting Guidelines](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-58907/12868) that have been communicated to the community in the past about what will elicit a YES vote from the Foundation.  Hopefully you will agree that this proposal has an on-chain focus and is tangible, achievable, and about the IC and in the interest of the IC.  Hence, if there are other reasons to vote against this proposal then I think we would all like to learn more so we can take it into consideration in the future.

Thank you so much for your help!

@alejandrade I think the main difference here is when people buy shares of stock in a company they know what they’re buying into - centralized control and direction. If they don’t like the direction, they can vote with their shares and/or sell.

The IC community sells decentralization, but is not decentralized in any way - from the node providers, to the boundary nodes, to updates to the replica - the decentralized protocol is just controlled by a single authority and not the voters. I believe we can get there eventually, but that might be at least 2-3 years out.

DFINITY employees do an amazing job of listening to the back and forth of many different viewpoints on the forums and take our concerns into account, I have nothing but positive things to say about all of the patient hardworking folks at DFINITY, especially with all the crap we say on the forums (@diegop you are a saint) - but for any significant new feature, the community has not been able to convince DFINITY (or at least the C-suite) that a passed proposal is worth being put on the roadmap.

It’s a hard pill to swallow, realizing that I locked up my ICP in a neuron thinking my voting power would actually matter. It doesn’t matter though - governance votes are simply a show for the community with no actual forcing function. 

All that really matters are the votes on updates to the replica - many of which pass with 99%+ approval ratings as everyone’s neurons are default following DFINITY.

This proposal has been submitted to the NNS ([proposal 72189](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/72189)) since the deliberation has gone quiet.  It also has the benefit of being submitted while the proposal weight for Governance is still 20.  DFINITY [indicated earlier today](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275/156) that the proposal weight will reduce to 1 tomorrow when they implement the tactical fix for spam ([proposal 70015](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70015)).  Since this proposal is aligned with the original intent of proposal weights, which is to encourage active participation in governance, it seemed fitting to submit this proposal before the proposal weights are reverted.

jsull9 | 2022-07-26 02:50:32 UTC | #19

I'm all for prioritizing decentralization over taxes... Even if it means my taxes become more confusing, and complicated, or it creates a separate income event. I'm happy to "do my part" in either direction. However, if someone could take the time to work with me to understand which way their vote is being cast and why... I would truly appreciate it, and my voting power could potentially be used more adequately/ abstain from this vote if I feel necessary. Not that my voting power would really sway a vote but like I said I'm just willing to do my part.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-26 03:01:11 UTC | #20

Absolutely nothing prove that proposal 48623 will give you a tax relief.  It was only a Dfinity assumption, without any tax firm advice.  Although it was asked to contact 1 or 2 reputable tax firm, they ignored the demand.  Don't ask me why.  Probably afraid of the answer.  In fact, if you stand on their side and the tax man decide clearly otherwise, you mey get in some tax trouble.  Seeking a tax advisor is the best thing to do, beforere relying on proposal 48623.  Only my humble opinion.  I have been involved with the tax of many countries before but I am not a tax advisor.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-07-26 03:01:38 UTC | #21

So, I'm not concerned about it creating a substantial tax burden personally. If my rewards act as income, at my current position I won't move out of my current tax bracket unless it boosts my salary by 50k a year which I don't see happening anytime soon.

I just want to understand the process for my own understanding. I am going to be seeking a tax expert this season 100%. I'm not standing on their side or anyone's for that matter... I am just trying to cast my vote more accurately.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-26 04:02:36 UTC | #22

Thank you for all this work.  Sad to see that Dfinity didn't even acknowledge the concern of your previous post and have ignored it completely.  To me,  they seems to follow order from up above, like seen with the initiator of proposal 48623 was doing. Concerns are growing more and more among the community, from previous heavy IC promoter, and with good reasons.
I have deleted the rest of this post.  Useless.

EDIT: I think Internet Computer is 99% a huge and impressive success.  I also think the IC decentralize governance is a huge fail.  DAO is quiet a new concept and maybe DAO will just not work.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-26 04:17:21 UTC | #23

To be honest, I’m not pessimistic about IC governance.  I just think we are all learning as we go and I hope this proposal will add new clarity.  As the saying goes, Rome wasn’t built in a day.  Decentralization will take time.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-26 04:48:27 UTC | #24

Good to hear.  You are an example of resilience and patience.  I need to learn this part from you. 
I do not mind that decentralization takes time.  But until then, saying people vote count or saying IC is decentralized  is only a show, as stated by @justmythoughts  and I totally agree
Transparency should not take time though.  Transparency is the least we deserve.

bjoernek | 2022-07-26 09:10:36 UTC | #25

Hi all, apologies that I did not provide any feedback from the side of DFINITY yet. 

The feedback requires further syndication (and some people are out currently out). I hope that we can provide feedback by end of today.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-26 14:39:51 UTC | #26

Hi all, as promised, here is the feedback from DFINITY on this motion proposal 

## We understand the background of the proposal

We appreciate the constructive inputs by the community. We all share the same vision on bringing the IC forward and acknowledge that different participants have different priorities. We are grateful for having such an active community and a lively discussion about roadmap priorities.

## Why we are voting no

As outlined in this earlier [blog post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-58907/12868), the NNS controls the IC but not community members working on the IC. Hence we believe that the NNS should not be used, for example, to propose other community entities perform off-chain actions.

As a side comment, we remark that proposal 55651 (Periodic confirmation) requires further design enhancements, because in its current form it does not allow to execute quickly urgent updates as outlined [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801).

## How we suggest to proceed

We are fully committed to working with the community on a holistic spam prevention and voting enhancements after the major release of the SNS and suggest doing this in a new [technical working group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-technical-working-groups/11781) on governance.

Given the intense discussions on governance topics in the forum, we may have missed to emphasize all the non-governance work the R&D team is working on. For transparency, we note that only a small fraction of our R&D works on governance.

We intend to share further details on the DFINITY roadmap and a detailed breakdown of our R&D capacity in the next Global R&D meeting on July 27th. In addition, we will share further information about joint initiatives like technical working groups and community-led engagements. This meeting will be made public and participants can register [here](https://internetcomputer.org/live-sessions/#Global-RandD-July-2022).

Whats the difference between "the community wants this feature" and "the community wants this feature to be prioritized"? We can add features, but have no voice in how soon we think they should be implemented?

[quote="bjoernek, post:26, topic:14461"]

[/quote]

How will these enhancements be decided upon? Another proposal? Why haven't concerns been raised sooner by Dfinity? Dfinity even voted yes on it.

If that's how things will have to go in the future then just get rid of governance entirely, have proposals be submitted as code changes, so we know exactly whats going to be implemented and vote on it, if it passes its immediately implemented, otherwise back to the drawing board. Adding features to a wishlist unaware on how and when they'll be implemented seems a bit redundant.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-07-27 04:48:10 UTC | #28

The last couple of days there’s been some action in [this thread with respect to 55651](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801/56) - it’s just a bit disappointing it took as long as it did to have a discussion about DFINITY’s concerns and to have those concerns voiced at least a month after the proposal originally passed the NNS.

I think there’s definitely a solution in there that isn’t outrageously difficult or over-complicated. What would help is to understand all of the different ideas that DFINITY has brainstormed for implementation as well as the various attack vectors they have considered. Also understanding their current process for how the DFINITY neuron is controlled in order to push out hotfixes would help in designing such a feature. But until recently that more detailed context hasn’t been surfaced.

I’d be happy to collaborate in a forum type back-and-forth environment with DFINITY to help coalesce around a solution, as I’m sure the rest of the community would be happy to participate in the technical implementation design and details - I’d just want to know that DFINITY is actively thinking about actually how a proposal would be implemented, and putting a **good faith effort** to think through solutions for how such a feature could be implemented in a secure fashion, and to communicate those brainstormed ideas with the community so that we can help iterate on and maybe even take on implementation tasks if we have the bandwidth and technical-depth. But without communication, from the outside (not DFINITY internal) sometimes it just feels like we’re all standing around waiting for an update.

@bjoernek as for proposal 38985, which also passed with >90% of the vote back in January - have there been any concerns with or plans/ideas for implementing that proposal?

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-07-27 04:58:40 UTC | #29

where is the decentralization of having a proposal approved but not executed and only executes those they prefer?

LefterisJP | 2022-07-27 09:49:56 UTC | #30

I am just posting here to have it in writing that as a seed investor I am very disappointed with the direction things are going and will vote FOR this proposal and ask for a way for us to be able to prioritize things that matter.

Focus on the tech, and not on things like that "tax improvement" proposal that has made taxes horrible for all of us (I work with an accounting firm and deal with multiple jurisdictions). At this point I am baffled by how the foundation self-sabotages the project by spending resources on things that are engineered to make things more complicated and have absolutely zero benefit and do the opposite of what their stated intention is. Not to mention the discord, and fighting it sows between investors and users.

On-chain governance for everything means nothing, if there is no way to enforce it and if the foundation and its friends hold the majority of votes.

Please for the love of all that is holy. Stop self-sabotaging your project.

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-07-27 11:49:06 UTC | #31

It's time to expand the ICP network.  I think tax optimizations are a waste of time.  If someone has to pay taxes, that's their business, not DFINITY's business.

Edit: And also it is not fair to evaluate "manual voting" and "voting by following" the same.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-27 11:44:47 UTC | #32

I read their voting guideline again.  One item read:  
 ***About the IC and In the interest of the IC** - The proposal should be about the IC and of interest to the IC.*
Programming to tweaking maturity to try avoiding taxes in some jusrisdiction is certainly **NOT of the interest to the IC**

So they don't even follow their own guideline.

-------------------------

Sal_Paradise | 2022-07-27 12:12:37 UTC | #33

I wholeheartedly agree. Dfinity does so much right, and I really hate to criticize them but when they go shooting themselves in the foot with such stunts like this, I just find it highly disappointing, and it's not the first time. IMO it's going to be similar decisions like this that are going to make or break this project.  Reputation is everything imo, and its hard to recover once flawed, as were already experiencing from the broader market.

This is an industry that is built upon trust and decentralization. if we can't trust the foundation, which is building the entire project, to make the correct decisions for the protocol and community, and not just purely directed for whales and large token holders in mind - why should we even bother to participate?

To be fair, we have exactly this today, but not many people vote on it, they instead follow the foundation. But an example is https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/72143, this proposal proposes to changes the governance canister, and you can look up the git commit and inspect the code, and the change only happens if this proposal is accepted. 

I think the purpose of motion proposals is figuring out what the community wants before people spending a lot of effort actually building it.

@Manu exactly!

At the same time, it’s quite evident that the community
* heavily supported 55651 and 38985
* had then and still today has significant resistance to 48623

Maybe I can share my personal thoughts in a bit more detail.

First of all, I completely understand why this proposal is submitted. I think there are some explanations for how this happened, and how we can improve going forward. 

1. @justmythoughts points out that it's disappointing that DFINITY is late in voicing concerns wrt 55651 and 38985. I think this is mostly fair criticism. In the case of 38985, there have been comments from @lara and myself showing that we think this idea is not fully baked yet. But what should we then do in such a case? If we consider the proposal as a high level intent, it makes sense to vote it in, but it's not a super concrete proposal that we can implement right away (as the comments show), so I'm not even sure what the "right" vote would be. For 55651, I did voice this concern to the proposal authors, but should've done so on the public forum instead. I agree that it is inconsistent that DFINITY voted in favor of this proposal while having reservations, and we have definitely learned from this and will improve. 

2. Wrt the "tax optimization". I think it's a bit more fundamental than that, what maturity is and how it can be taxed is quite important to many neuron holders and I believe in particular also to the foundation, which explains why this was done with high priority. 

3. A more broad challenge is that currently our motion proposals are of the form "lets do X". People vote in favor if they like X. But inevitably our wishlist of things we would like to have grows faster than we can implement, which will inevitably lead to adopted motion proposals that are not realized yet. I personally think this is okay, the alternative would be that we start voting no on proposals that we actually think are a good idea, only for the reason that we think we won't have time.

Overall, I think this just shows that we as the ICP community are still figuring out how to best deal with governance and priorities. On the positive side, i think what we have in the ICP community with motion and real proposals is already really great: with motion proposals we have a measurable way whether the community wants something, and with all other proposals the community must approve real changes before they can happen. At the same time it's not perfect yet, and I think this discussion is therefore very valuable and i really appreciate all the active participants discussing governance here on the forum, and in particular @justmythoughts, @wpb, and @Zane for starting this discussion. I hope that everybody also sees that the foundation is trying very hard to improve, as demonstrated for example by the changes to our public roadmap that were announce yesterday in the GR&D, and the intent to start a working group on governance as @bjoernek mentioned.

@manu thank you for sharing your thoughts.  Overall I agree with your assessment.  I think motion proposals should be conceptual ideas that don't need to be fully developed.  If I were the developer trying to implement a proposal, I would want to have some degrees of freedom on designing a solution that satisfies the proposal intent.  Inevitably there will be issues that are recognized during detailed design that hadn't been considered at the front end.  Developers need freedom to address those issues properly.  I hope motion proposals don't move to the opposite extreme of needing to be fully baked before they are submitted to the NNS.

This proposal we submitted resonates for me because it's just not clear how community driven proposals get prioritized.  I wasn't opposed to Compounding Maturity (48623), in fact I voted to Approve (even though the ICPMN neuron voted to Reject).  However, I definitely wasn't aware that DFINITY was working on it with haste.  I assumed all NNS related resources were working on SNS.  I don't recall any communications that 48623 was in progress as well.  So when the details of the modulation function came out directly on the heels of reverting proposal weights (70015), it definitely had me second guessing the purpose of active participation in governance and community driven proposals.  Maybe the right answer is that the community should be prepared to implement the solution if we are going to lead a proposal submission.  That would be a paradigm shift for me and I'm not sure it can be done without forming some sort of secondary foundation or association that has resources behind it to accomplish those kinds of goals.  

I have a lot of respect and appreciation for everyone at the foundation.  The work you all are doing is hard and the community can definitely be demanding at times.  I agree we are all just trying to figure out governance and priorities.  Thank you for engaging in this conversation.

I also want to recognize that @bjoernek has done an amazing job since he started at DFINITY.  He has provided much needed transparency on governance related topics and he is very diplomatic about it.  I have great appreciation for his engagement with the community.

Just can second this. 
It's a really bad look if all the community neurons people follow vote For something and then Dfinity itself just blocks it. Per definition this will upset a lot of people in the community, who put in a lot of thought and effort into these proposals. Don't even want to start with decentralization. Why all this governance theater in the first place if people can just follow the foundation, get the same rewards and can't decide something on their own if Dfinity itself doesn't like it?
If it's a resource problem might as well slow other things if this is something majority of the community wants.
Community matters and is the main driver for adoption and the success of projects in this space. ICP had a really horrible start community wise due to the PA and there is finally a possibility to turn this around and we see a more and more positive community developing. Don't trash this right away and think more about the implications these overruling votes have.
PS: Is there a community discord or similar where it's easier to get alerted about these things?

One place for community discussions on various IC related topics is the [ICP Maximalist Network on Telegram](https://t.me/icpmaximalistnetwork).

A [NNS Proposals Bot](https://t.me/NNSProposalsBot) also exists on Telegram that will alert you with push notifications when new governance proposals are submitted to the NNS.

The [Taggr app](https://taggr.top) also has a proposals bot you can follow, but I don’t know if it has push notifications yet. 

The best place for deliberation on specific governance topics is right here in the forum in the Governance category.

It might look similar, but it's not the same 
- Canister upgrades usually contain many changes, they are more similar to a software upgrade than an IC equivalent of BIPs. 
- As you said barely anyone votes on those proposals that is because we assume all the changes are either tech improvements or implementation of previously accepted proposals.

I agree and that is one of the reasons I decided to go ahead with this proposal, if motion proposals are meant to figure out **what** the community wants,it should be fine to also use them to figure **how much** the community wants something, Dfinity's arguments for voting against the proposal seem to be contradicting:

[quote="bjoernek, post:26, topic:14461"]
the NNS controls the IC but not community members working on the IC. Hence we believe that the NNS should not be used, for example, to propose other community entities perform off-chain actions
[/quote]

Why doesn't this apply for motion proposals? They literally are meant to ask community members (Dfinity for the time being) to work on a task, which is an off-chain action.

Furthermore this proposal followed all Dfinity's guidelines, it's tangible, achievable and about the IC and In the interest of the IC.
