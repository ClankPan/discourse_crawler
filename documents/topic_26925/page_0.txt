After upgrading dfx getting this error while upgrading the canister.

Error: The lookup path ([726571756573745F737461747573, 7CDAD047D335AB883510B3A8172196E212EA172786D4291E9079768F0D4D9570, 737461747573]) is absent in the certificate.

Any thoughts ?

Are you running a local network? In that case I'd suggest you restart a clean replica. `dfx stop && dfx start --clean`.

No this is live deployment @Severin

Which dfx version did you use before and after the upgrade?

I just found another bug report with the same issue. Can you add any extra info? like is it only redeployments, only in certain repos, or all the time?

Related, we were just trying to look into this more yesterday as it's affecting our tests again and we're really trying to embrace http_request and http_request_update: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/lookuppathabsent/23461

Actually, Canister was deployed with dfx 0.8.0 and now i have the latest dfx 0.15.0

Now, I am facing the issue.

That's an awfully large version jump... I still can't reproduce the issue myself. Can you maybe try to narrow down the version in which the issue started to appear?

-------------------------

Yeah I tried 0.9.3, 0.13 , 0.14.0 as well @Severin. If you share your principal i will add you as a controller to the problematic canister. And you can deploy the same what we have i will share that as well.

Does it still happen with the latest version of dfx? I have a suspicion what happened, but the code path has changed so that I don't think this would still happen
