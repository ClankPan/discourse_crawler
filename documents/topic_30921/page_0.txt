the error I am getting is:
"ERROR in ./src/declarations/dbank/index.js 4:0-44"
when I open index.js in the path mentioned above 
I see this:
"import { idlFactory } from './dbank.did.js';
export { idlFactory } from './dbank.did.js';"
but There is only "service.did.js " in "./" folder.
I tried to change the './dbank.did.js' to "service.did.js " the issue did vanish 
but every time I use "npm start" the "service.did.js " gets replaced by " './dbank.did.js';" 
how do I solve this?

Can you please share your `dfx.json`? 

1. Is there a canister named `dbank`?
2. How are you creating your declaration files? When you run command `dfx generate`, does it create src -> declarations folder?
