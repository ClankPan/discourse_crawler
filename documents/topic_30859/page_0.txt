# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/5ba1412f9175d987661ae3c0d8dbd1ac3e092b7d/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 5ba1412f9175d987661ae3c0d8dbd1ac3e092b7d
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Thanks Dfinity. Can I ask if the subnet rollout schedule for this IC-OS release has already been planned already (at least in terms of which subnets will receive it, and in what order)? Given the ECDSA and Schnorr related changes and refactoring, it would be nice to see the changes rolled out to at least the fuqsr and 2fq7c application subnets before the uzr34 and pzp6e system and fiduciary subnets.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **129746**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/85) 

Proposal ID: **129747**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/86) 

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @ilbert, @hpeebles, and @Lorimer.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @jwiegley, @tiago89, and @Gekctek.  I recommend folks take a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here or in the thread of each respective proposal in our community on OpenChat if you have any questions or suggestions about these reviews.
