Hi everyone! I am an Australian grown engineer living in the Isle of man :isle_of_man:. (bonus points if you know where this is) I have just discovered Dfinity and I am enthralled by it. I thought have to get involved, so here I am :smiley: . I'm going to be sponging up as much as I can. I love creating things that solve simple to complex problems. I am working projects in embedded hardware to make interacting with computers better (I won't discuss until I have a p.o.c... VC welcome!).

I believe you are in Scotland, not that far away from me :) I'm also new, so hey and let's roll! :)
