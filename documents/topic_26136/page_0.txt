I staked my icp more than a year ago for 8 years, i did not start dissolving,  if i do now, will i wait for 8 years or 7 years to unlock my icp. And also, i have not been voting in any proposals but i saw a proposal history in my nns dashboards.  Is it my votes or the outcome of the vote for those proposal

If you start dissolving a neuron with an 8-year dissolve delay today, then it will take 8 years to dissolve.

*Voting History* shows how the neuron voted on recent proposals. You say that you have not been voting, which I assume means that you have not been voting manually. Most neurons vote automatically by following other neurons on certain proposal topics. You can use the NNS front-end dapp to see how following is set up for your neuron.
