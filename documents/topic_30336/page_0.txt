Hi, I'm getting the following error after updating dfx to v0.19.0:

```
Failed during wasm installation call: Candid returned an error: input: 4449444c036d016c01cedfa0a804026d7b010003_202bd005334f52501857575138e1408030ba73e1418fcf689c7abcba51a1b93f40208f875f5fc064d8c0921924a67dd08f4e19b32768f88d6f6dddb1b687c7c9cecb20c8d4529efb522d4a82bb236e8ad73ef952ecb954813a831809712b01e6ba217a

type table1 = record { 1_158_164_430 : table2 }
type table2 = vec nat8
wire_type: record { 1_158_164_430 : table2 }, expect_type: unknown
make: *** [reinstall] Error 255
```

I'm trying to do a canister reinstall with:
```
rm -rf .dfx
cargo clean
dfx build --ic
dfx canister --ic install --mode=reinstall ...
```

How can I solve this error? Thanks!

This seems like a known error that was discussed in [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/embedding-wasm-dfx-0-17-0-crashing-where-previous-version-works/27916).

Here is [the current workaround](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/embedding-wasm-dfx-0-17-0-crashing-where-previous-version-works/27916/28) until `dfx 0.20.0` is fully released.

Hi Jennifer, gm!

I tried the workaround, thank you.

Is there a way to prevent a canister from being able to reinstall?

I just updated ic-stable-structures to its latest version (0.6.4), but BoundedStorable is not supported anymore. Where can I get it from?
