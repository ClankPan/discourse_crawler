# Update:

**TLDR: As of ~~March 20, 2023~~ April 20, 2023, new canisters will only be accessible through the icp0.io domain. Existing canisters will be accessible both through `ic0.app` and `icp0.io`.**

## 1. Summary

In February 2023, Spamhaus temporarily added `ic0.app` to a blocklist. As a result, an extensive mitigation plan was put in place and [communicated to the IC community](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/important-community-update-on-ic0-app-domain-being-flagged-by-an-anti-spam-blocklist/18537). While the need for a new default domain is less pressing now that `ic0.app` is no longer on a blocklist, good reasons remain to introduce a new default domain. In particular, by no longer making new canisters accessible through `ic0.app`, the `ic0.app` domain is less likely to end up on a new blocklist. Existing dapps, such as Internet Identity under `identity.ic0.app`, are thus shielded from the impact of user-generated content.

## 2. Next Step: On Monday, March 20 , the following will happen:

* New canisters deployed to the IC will be accessible through the `icp0.io` domain and not through `ic0.app`. Developers may additionally configure a [custom domain](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/) for the dapp.
* This change will happen via an update to the boundary nodes

## 3. This will be communicated to developer and wider ICP community in the following places:

* Developer documentation will reflect this change: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/home
* Announcements via social media
* Update dfx to use `icp0.io` instead of `ic0.app` going forward. This will be part of the 0.13.2 release.

## 4. What this means for existing smart contracts:

* This will not affect existing canister smart contracts using the `ic0.app` domain.
* New existing canisters can also be accessed via the `icp0.io` domain

Gekctek | 2023-03-10 20:21:41 UTC | #2

I haven't been following the follow up chats after the incident. What makes the .io superior to the .app? Or are we just protecting the .app domains during this transition period

-------------------------

diegop | 2023-03-10 23:12:22 UTC | #3

It is not necessarily superior. Since there will be many more new canisters than currently exist, the main intent is to limit the reputational impact on `.app` domain by having new canisters exist in the new domain.

Does that make more sense?

-------------------------

Gekctek | 2023-03-10 23:14:08 UTC | #4

Yep. Thanks for the clarification. Keep up the good work. Can't wait for the boundary node changes

raw.icp0.io throws security errors on Chrome browsers..
So all new canisters created by our clients that need raw will not be viewable to them without 
explicitly closing out a browser 'red screen of death..'

Don't fix what is not broken ðŸ˜œ But really, what is the proposed solution for this??
Wait until raw.icp0.io is removed from the blocklists and have users just deal with it?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-03-15 06:28:13 UTC | #7

Check out the post here for more details.. It seems like it is on a blocklist.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/important-community-update-on-ic0-app-domain-being-flagged-by-an-anti-spam-blocklist/18537/105

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-03-15 06:38:56 UTC | #8

Also what about the host in agent.js files? https://ic0.app will this still work for calling new canisters?

-------------------------

jwendling | 2023-03-15 12:29:44 UTC | #9

**Regarding blocklisting:**
I can confirm that `raw.icp0.io` was listed on Google Safe Browsing, but was removed ~2 weeks ago.

See https://forum.dfinity.org/t/important-community-update-on-ic0-app-domain-being-flagged-by-an-anti-spam-blocklist/18537/103?u=jwendling

But I can also confirm that Google Safe Browsing lists some canisters  that are already served via `icp0.io`. If you check the Safe Browsing entry it states `Some pages on this site are unsafe`, which means that it shows the warning only for those sites that are listed and not all.

I don't see any warning, when I browse a canister using `raw.icp0.io` or `icp0.io`.

**Regarding `raw` in general:**
To my understanding `raw` works for `icp0.io` as it works for `ic0.app`. Maybe @raymondk can comment on that as well.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-03-15 12:44:36 UTC | #10

In that thread 'Google Safebrowsing' was the only one left. It has been removed from that list since then?

Last time it was users who mentioned it to us. Our team also, did not see any issues until users reported it. I guess we can retry this and see what they say Monday.

If it is confirmed off all lists, hopefully there will no be issues :slight_smile:

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-03-15 13:37:50 UTC | #11

If you are using the latest version of agent-js, it has been changed to send `/api` calls to `icp-api.io`.
see: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/commit/6b640309104740290218aa73235f7a34c0e4214b

Also starting v1.5.2 the Service Worker will translate all `/api` requests to go to `icp-api.io`
see: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/0aee610b996eed442bcbd7a72b5b74dc8fd87344

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-03-15 21:44:40 UTC | #12

Cool. But the old one still works right?

For example, say we have 500 client apps that are in use sometimes but were never intended to be updated.

Hey @diegop 

1. Can you ask the team to postpone this until we are off lists?
Last time I changed it, a few hours later I got bombarded with messages that sites were blocked or no longer working..I can un-revert those changes.. but I really do not want to un-un-revert again.

2. The question above about the /api endpoint. The old endpoint ic0.app will always work right? I do not need to go back and notify 500~ people to update to a new endpoint @raymondk ? New sites can use icp-api.io endpoint, while old sites can keep the old endpoint?

**Yes, postponing is very much possible if people need more time. It is good to do it as early as possible, but definitely looking for developer feedback.** I think it would be helpful if you share how much more time you think is needed. "once we are off lists" is a bit vague, as I think the domain will be added and removed from lists for a while...

Does that make sense?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-03-16 22:30:04 UTC | #17

I had 10 people test and 3 said they saw the blocked list error on Chrome.. Someone above also mentioned Cisco blocklist. New domain should === old domain in usability. 

I have never saw or was reported to about a browser level error about phishing schemes with the raw.ic0.app domain.. If 1/3 users checking out IC sites see this error, it is not good for anyone.

Test, test, test, remove from lists. Do what cryptographers do and make the probability 1/F where F is some very large field ðŸ˜Š 

@jwendling mentioned not seeing any error. My entire team saw no errors last time, but when we pushed to prod a lot of people globally noticed within an hour. This needs to be tested in many locations to make sure that it is very unlikely for users to get blocked.

-------------------------

I have escalated your concerns to folks @apotheosis  (though I am sure they are reading this thread actively)

* /api calls will continue to work for all canisters on all the domains (ic0.app, icp0.io and icp-api.io)
* If you are using the default service worker or more recent version of the agents your api calls are already going to icp-api.io

[quote="apotheosis, post:15, topic:18889"]

[/quote]

We can postpone for sure but @diegop is right that it is likely that icp0.io will continue going on and off spam lists. I would recommend using the [custom domains] feature (https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/) and making api calls to icp-api.io

The reason for this was an active entry in the Google Safe Browsing list, which is not present anymore.

In general I fully agree on what @raymondk wrote. The problem is that we can't guarantee that the domain will never end up on another list. We are actively approaching any Vendor that we are aware of and in the last days, we have seen additional entries for Sophos, Heimdal and CyRadar.

ic0.app is not affected by the entries at the moment because the people behind the malicious canisters are already actively using the new domain icp0.io and no longer use ic0.app. Lucky for us! If we don't migrate to the new domain and leave ic0.app open, there is a persistent threat to ic0.app, which is a bigger risk because it still impacts system services like Internet Identity.

As @raymondk already mentioned, we strongly recommend to use **Custom Domains** as a shared domain is affected by the usage all canisters and this unfortunately includes those who use it for a malicious purpose.

---

@BHare1985 Thank you for the notification. We will contact Cisco and hopefully solve the case very soon!

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-03-17 09:29:50 UTC | #21

@jwendling and @raymondk I understand your points. Please understand mine: it just needs to be as good as the last domain. If I change it and within an hour a dozen people DM about seeing a site error while trying to access it.. that is truly bad. This is exactly what happened last time I changed the domain over to icp0.io. 

The ic0.app domain never had a user report to us.. (1+ years of use).

Scams sites are basically, almost always blocked by Dfinity at this point. I know this because we index all of the sites on the IC and have worked with your team on this in the past.

icme.io: deploys apps for users. We do not control their domains, they can set them up if they want to, but by default they are the standard domain provided by the IC.

kinic.io: indexes FE on the IC.. It does not gather or map custom domain names.

"Just use a custom domain for your dApp.. " is not a good answer in our case. Thank you!

-------------------------

BHare1985 | 2023-03-17 14:52:40 UTC | #22

It's OpenDNS not cisco.  Here is the page it redirects me to https://phish.opendns.com/main?url=raw.icp0.io&server=chi3&prefs=&tagging=&nref

Update:

Based on all feedback from the community, **this change is being postponed for a month (target: end of April, most likely April 20,2023)**, with the intent to give folks more time to:

* Make whatever changes they need for their dapps
* Make more noise about the change so more people see it
* Engage & iterate with the community more about the situation surrounding domains

-------------------------

jwendling | 2023-03-20 08:17:50 UTC | #24

@apotheosis 
I completely understand your point of view and it is also important to us that icp0.io has a good reputation and we actively address every blocklist entry. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee any reputation.

The fact that we had the Google Safe Browsling listing on the day of your conversion was really unfortunate and it is understandable that this causes uncertainty.

> "Just use a custom domain for your dAppâ€¦ " is not a good answer in our case. Thank you!

Sorry, this was not meant to be directed at you directly, but a general recommendation. I understand that in your case it is not simply done with a custom domain.

Could it be an option for `icme.io` dApps to register a custom domain under a domain that you control instead of using the default domain? E.g. `dapp-name.sites.icme.io`

---
@BHare1985 AFAIK Cisco acquired OpenDNS a few years ago. But no matter who maintains or manages it now, we will file a request to have icp0.io removed.

Hello!

The Boundary Node team deployed this change today. Any new canisters created will not be available on ic0.app anymore. As usual, they will be available on icp0.io.

The following should illustrate the behavior change:

*internetcomputer.org (old canister) => oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai*

Works on ic0.app => `curl -sLv https://oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai.ic0.app`
Works on icp0.io => `curl -sLv https://oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai.icp0.io`

*5perb-kiaaa-aaaag-abkaq-cai (new canister)*

Blocked on ic0.app => `curl -sLv https://5perb-kiaaa-aaaag-abkaq-cai.ic0.app`
Works   on icp0.io => `curl -sLv https://5perb-kiaaa-aaaag-abkaq-cai.icp0.io`

Hi @LowFreeKey, can you give us more detail please?

This looks like a certificate error - are you behind a university firewall or VPN?

- what is an example of a URL are you using?
- what is the output of the following commands:

```
curl -sLvv https://5perb-kiaaa-aaaag-abkaq-cai.icp0.io
curl -sLvv https://5perb-kiaaa-aaaag-abkaq-cai.ic0.app
```

MrWoo034 | 2023-04-25 16:08:02 UTC | #37

If we're managing multiple canisters from the same project, is there a recommended approach to how we should handle setting our provider(s) in our dfx.json after this change?

Do I list multiple providers in my `dfx.json` as follows:

```
{ 
  ...
  "networks": {
    "ic": {
      "providers": [
        "https://ic0.app",
        "https://icp0.io"
      ],
      "controllers": {},
      "type": "persistent"
    }
}
```

If I do the above, is `dfx` smart enough to determine which canisters are managed behind which provider? 

Are there any drawbacks to managing existing canisters through the old domain, or is that preferred?

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-04-25 16:21:08 UTC | #38

I would recommend you use only `icp0.io` as the only provider in `dfx.json`. The provider handling code is 'not as nice as I'd like it to be' and only picks the first one in the list :frowning_face:

-------------------------

MrWoo034 | 2023-04-25 16:56:06 UTC | #39

Thanks for the update :slight_smile: will follow that pattern.  Any known pitfalls of managing older canisters on the newer domain?

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-04-25 16:58:58 UTC | #40

The only two pitfalls that I'm aware of are:
* asset canister CSP: Your asset canister(s) may have a content security policy set for it to only accept assets from the old domain. Check in your `.ic-assets.json` files (if present)
* Internet Identity login produces different IDs when logging in through a different domain. This is a limitation/feature of how WebAuth works

-------------------------

LowFreeKey | 2023-04-25 19:11:52 UTC | #41

Thanks for getting back ^^

Well it's bizarre really. I've connected to both eduroam and my local Uni wifi and the error persists. However my local wifi clearly has some sort of firewall in place whereas I am able to access any content on eduroam.

rbirkner | 2023-04-26 09:57:42 UTC | #42

Yes indeed, it looks like there is some filtering in place. When you look at the certificate name in your second curl, you can see that there was something injected:
```
CN=landing.soc.ja.net
```
Looks like your university is using the ["Janet Network resolver" service](https://beta.jisc.ac.uk/janet-network-resolver), which blocks the request:
> Janet Network Resolver helps to protect your organisation by preventing your devices and network from accessing known malicious or compromised websites. Itâ€™s free to all Jisc member colleges, universities and research institutions and Janet connected customer organisations who have actively registered for the service.

On their landing page, they specify an email where you can report wrong restrictions. You can do that if you want to: 
> If you think a request to a website is wrongfully restricted, write an email to [irt@jisc.ac.uk](mailto:irt@jisc.ac.uk)

In any case, it would be interesting, if you could also check the following canisters to understand whether specific canisters are blocked or all and under which domains (`ic0.app` and `icp0.io`).
```
