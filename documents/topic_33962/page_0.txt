*Note: We start a [topic](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/attention-dao-ideas-for-discussion/33883) in the Developers category, but our customers have a problem replying, so we move it here.

**Purpose**: **An event-driven system for connecting Internet Computer Ecosystem projects.**

While working on the [ICRC72 standard](https://github.com/icdevs/ICEventsWG/blob/main/README.md), the Event Working Group came up with the idea of creating a DAO to manage message canisters within the Internet Computer ecosystem. We propose to test a new type of DAO, membership in which can be obtained by directing your attention to it.

![Attention_m|690x448](upload://9sg6ISaJ4i1KXC86cpz6SC2IilB.jpeg)

**Attention** is the new currency in our information-saturated world. It shapes our worldview, drives our decisions, and ultimately affects the quality of our lives.
In an era of information overload, it’s critical to have the ability to independently manage where and how we direct the precious focus of our attention.

![logo|29x25, 75%](upload://8bnlkpDdyHgy5LQ2TMzN1MAPghz.jpeg) **Attention DAO** provides a solution to this challenge. It’s a platform where your attention becomes a valuable asset and publishers and subscribers interact freely, choosing what content to create and consume.

An **Attention DAO** lets information consumers organize their attention to gain bargaining power that is currently given away for free on platforms like Facebook, X, and other similar services. Through organization and collaboration users can make sure that if they are the product, they are compensated accordingly. **Attention DAO** invites both consumers and producers to be owners of the platform and will let us experiment with how to balance that economy.

![Voting_Rewards|690x448](upload://9CGlcXLqpiDo0CUcCFpiIZhxWSJ.jpeg)

The key principle of the **Attention DAO** is that users are in full control of their attention. They choose where to direct it and receive a direct benefit from their choice.

This benefit is expressed in **$FOCUS** tokens, which can be used within the ecosystem or exchanged for ICP.

**Key Features of Attention DAO:**

* Targeted communications: *Event Hub* for precise audience reach while maintaining privacy.
* Attention Economy: **$FOCUS** token, rewards for platform activity.
* Decentralized governance: Participation of **$FOCUS** holders in governance, rewards for voting.
* Tokenomics: 10 million **$FOCUS**, up to 50% cashback, revenue only through the ecosystem, transparent revenue distribution.
* Integration with Internet Computer: Exchange **$FOCUS** for **ICP**, plans to implement **SNS** (Service Nervous System).
* Ecosystem of Mutual Growth

**Join Attention DAO today and start monetizing your attention!**

Next step: We’ll have a WG meeting every other Wednesday to discuss more,

***Note:*** **Attention DAO** is one of many potential *Application DAOs* that we believe will utilize the underlying ICRC-72-based *Event Utility DAO* emerging from the Events Utility working group. It is important for the working group to have one, or many consumers of the utility service to gain important insight into what technical and economic requirements will be necessary to enable the *Utility DAO* to become a self-sufficient and autonomous piece of infrastructure for Internet Computer application development.

**Attention DAO** and the eventual *Event Utility DAO* will be the first organic, community-emergent DAOs to emerge in the Internet Computer ecosystem, and we encourage your involvement. Please bring feedback and ideas!

**Attention DAO** will be a solution that allows receiving and sending information from a single point both within the Internet Computer (ICP) ecosystem and beyond. It’s a kind of information management center that provides integration and data exchange between canisters and blockchains.

Let’s consider some key use cases for **Attention DAO**:

1. **“Ethereum Event Trap”:**

Imagine being able to instantly respond to events on the Ethereum network directly from the ICP ecosystem. Our hub can monitor Ethereum transactions and send their logs to an ICP canister. This opens up many possibilities, such as automatically issuing ICRC-7 NFTs on the ICP mainnet when a certain event occurs on Ethereum.

**Case Study: "NFT Certificates with Reputation for Online Courses"**

Hey everybody. Check out this cool use case for **Attention DAO:**
1. A student completes an online course.
2. The school sends a certificate of completion via Attention DAO.
3. Our aVa reputation system checks the certificate and asks the student for feedback.
4. aVa then creates an NFT certificate with reputation scores for both the school and the student.
5. The feedback is sent back via Attention DAO.

![MacBook Air - 1 (7)|690x448](upload://iObUAhof8XI35Ip9HLbfQsEis7A.png)

**What's in it for everyone?**
- Schools get reputation points and FOCUS tokens.
- Students receive an NFT certificate, reputation points and FOCUS tokens.

It's a win-win! Schools are motivated to offer great courses, and students are rewarded for their hard work. Plus, the NFT certificates are a cool way to show off your skills!

What do you think? Could this make online learning more fun and rewarding?

**Case “Product Market-Fit for a New Project”**

The startup "A-tech" is developing a dApp on the Internet Computer. To attract the early adopters, the team is using the **Attention DAO:**

1. "A-Tech" creates an event in the Attention DAO, announcing the launch of a new application.
2. The startup defines the desired reactions: feedback, registration, beta testing, and reposts on social media outside the ICP ecosystem.
3. For each reaction, the "A-tech" startup assigns a reward in Focus tokens.
4. Attention DAO distributes the information among its subscribers. Participants interact with the application and receive Focus tokens.

![MacBook Air - 5 (5)|690x448](upload://6n6sD29Sb0Y91B2bwfC2NDyjJwH.png)


**Result:** The "A-tech" startup receives Attention, feedback, first users, and finding product-market fit. The community gets introduced to the new project and earns tokens. **Attention DAO demonstrates its effectiveness in attracting attention to significant events in the ICP ecosystem.**

This example shows how Attention DAO creates a win-win situation for developers and users, contributing to the growth of the Internet Computer ecosystem.

Wow, this looks like a really cool way to get people excited about new projects on ICP! I love how it seems to work out for everyone involved. I'm kind of curious about the nuts and bolts though - any idea how much it typically costs to bring in one active early user through Attention DAO? And I'm wondering, where do most of these users come from? It'd be interesting to know more about how this all plays out in practice!

-------------------------

Ollaogogo | 2024-08-08 16:11:30 UTC | #6

**We appreciate your interest!** 

**The cost of participation** depends on how interesting your project is presented, as well as the rewards you offer. 

**Users** will come from the Attention DAO community, the Internet Computer ecosystem, and eventually from outside the ICP. This is an effective way to attract active early users.

What do you think of this approach? We'd love to hear your opinions or experiences with similar programs!
