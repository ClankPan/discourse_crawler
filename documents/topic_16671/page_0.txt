Hi, 

Just to piggyback on this https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/2357

I want to use gzip for our canisters because the massive size. 

From my tests I was able to successfully gzip my test canister through dfx build and the installed wasm is around 2.5x-2.8x  smaller in size. 

This is how: https://github.com/gabrielnic/motoko-test/blob/main/dfx.json and https://github.com/gabrielnic/motoko-test/blob/main/compress.sh

Now my question is: is this the best way to do it? 

The issue with this is I still have to "manually" create the wasm and the did files. I don't have a problem with that but I'm wondering if there's a better way. For reference I use motoko.

Until we make dfx auto-gzip wasms this is probably the way to go. Here's how some other people are doing it, which may be a bit simpler, but doesn't work with `dfx deploy`: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/bug-since-upgrading-to-dfx-v0-12-running-into-failed-to-install-wasm-the-replica-returned-an-http-error-http-error-status-413-payload-too-large/16459/18

Ah yes, I'm aware of that, but the biggest issue is we have a lot of factories so we'll still have to run the manual gzip for a lot of canisters and we'll end up having a bash script. 

 Thank you for your input, we can use this for now until auto-gzip is enabled.
