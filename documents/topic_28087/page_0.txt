Pretty much the title. Does unspawned maturity affect the circulating supply? Subsequently, say many people are waiting for a specific price of ICP @ $500 (or really any price tbh) would a mass spawning of neurons at a certain price significantly inflate the supply taking down the price? Thanks.

Maturity does not count towards total supply, so yes, when neurons are disbursed, the total ICP supply increases.
Of course, this doesn't have a direct impact on the price by itself but the sell pressure indeed increases if there are more people who wish to sell unless there is a similar increase in demand.
