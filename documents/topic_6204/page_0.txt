I am almost totally lost folks.  Is there anyone in the Los Angeles area, or anyone who could get together with me via Skype or something? I am very new to back and to Mac.  I bought a Mac book pro, upgraded the OS to 10.13.6 it has an intel i7 chip. The journey continues.

Before deploying locally with `dfx deploy` you should start first a local simulated IC with `dfx start` (either in another tab or in the background `dfx start --background`).
