I am currently using WSL as my development environment on windows. 
The deployment was successful for the backend but stated a warning: `Cannot fetch Candid interface for icr1_transfer, sending arguments with inferred types.`

The error proceeded to: `Error: Failed update call.
Caused by: Failed update call.
  The replica returned a rejection error: reject code CanisterError, reject message Canister ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai has no update method 'icr1_transfer', error code None`. Then, the deplyement started all over and it tried creating canisters but resulted in: `Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed to build all canisters.
    Failed while trying to build all canisters.`

Do you use a script to deploy? This looks like multiple unrelated errors. Can you share more about what's going on?

Yea, thanks.
I even already figured it out, just some bugs with the code.
