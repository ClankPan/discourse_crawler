You can use Firefox's Containers [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) to test your apps with multiple users in a single browser window.

The sdk currently maintains a single user id in the browser's local storage, and you would normally need to use private browsing mode or switch to a different browser to test more than one user, so you may find this useful.
