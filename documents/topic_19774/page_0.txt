Is there a `dfx` command to list the controllers of a canister I created on the fly (not listed in my `dfx.json`) on my local replica?

I know its canister ID.

Yes, if you're one of the controllers you can do this:

A local canister:
```
dfx canister status <canister-id>
```

In production:

```
dfx canister --network=ic status <canister-id>
```

Exactly what I was looking for and, found a bug in my PR thanks to it 😉.
Thanks Islam!

Worked out like a glove. That command helped me debug the new feature I developed in Juno, which now provides controllers with two levels of permissions: Admin (stop/start/upgrade) and Read-Write (data only) 🥳.
