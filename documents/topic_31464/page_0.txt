**WaterNeuron SNS-DAO: Let Liquid Staking begin.**

**100% of the ICP raised during the SNS will be staked in an 8-year neuron**

Hey everyone, two weeks ago we [introduced WaterNeuron](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-waterneuron/30897). Thanks to all the feedback we've got, we improved the original design's governance and go-to-market.
 - Governance: All the NNS proposals will be mirrored into the WaterNeuron DAO. WTN stakers will be able to vote on the SNS proposal. One hour before the end of the NNS proposal whatever the outcome of the votes on the SNS proposal is, will be voted on the NNS.
- Go-to-market strategy: The DAO will progress through three distinct eras: Kiwi, Papaya, and WaterMelon. An SNS will mark each era. This SNS represents the first era, the Kiwi one. 
Changes to the airdrop have also been made. Users will incur tokens based on the table [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8JXo8xOB786usk8BaWPPcBJB7oFR0HWvA5y8kcfRqU/edit#gid=744103025). The tokens will be airdropped once the three eras are completed.

## WaterNeuron (WTN) and nICP FAQ

Below is a summary of the WaterNeuron telegram channel. Some questions asked might help everyone in the forum. 

## Best message
Jack Johnson provided an excellent summary of WaterNeuron:
![image|648x500, 75%](upload://3gtscJ73FQ89UKCQFpgQkuEHvsk.jpeg)


## Basics 
Some users did not understand the basics, so let's go over them one more time:
- *What is WaterNeuron (WTN)?*
WaterNeuron ($WTN) is the governance token for the WaterNeuron protocol. It allows holders to manage the DAO-controlled protocol, vote on NNS proposals, and receive a staking bonus.

- *What is $nICP?*
$nICP represents liquid staked $ICP. It is designed to offer competitive yields to attract users to the protocol.

## How does the yield work?

* **6-Month Neuron**: All ICP deposited in the 6-month neuron.
* **8-Year Neuron**: All ICP from the SNS (Service Nervous System).
* 90% of the maturity from the 6-month and 8-year neurons will go to nICP holders.

## SNS
- *Why is the SNS needed?*
The SNS is essential for early yield, incentivizing, and kickstarting a liquid staking wave. Without the SNS, the yield of $nICP would be just the yield of a 6-month neuron minus 10%.
- *What are the benefits of participating in the SNS?*
  - **Governance**: SNS participants receive WTN, which gives them voting power and control over the protocol.
  - **NNS Voting**: with locked $WTN, you can vote on mirrored NNS proposals and thus vote on the NNS.
  - **Yield**: 10% of the 6-month giga neuron yield goes to $WTN holders
- *What is the inflation rate, and why?*
  - The protocol aims to incentivize locking $WTN into neurons with a 5% inflation rate in the first year, dropping to 0.25% in subsequent years.
- *What is the difference between buying in on the SNS and using WaterNeuron to swap to nICP?
  -  **SNS Participation**: you get $WTN
  -  **Using the dApp**: You get $nICP

## Airdrop
Many users were interested in the airdrop

- *How does the airdrop work?*
  - If you mint 5 nICP, you get 40 WTN if you're in the first 80k nICP minted. This carries on per the table below!

![image|402x422, 75%](upload://4AVRd4y1PwE0AhLIXhO92yMAM2N.png)

- *Can I farm the airdrop by depositing $ICP and reselling it on DEX?*
Yes, you can. However When you sell nICP, you do so at the exchange rate set by the DEX (Decentralized Exchange), not the protocol.

- *When will the tokens be airdropped?*
  The airdrop will be claimable once the protocol's TVL (Total Value Locked) reaches 5% of the ICP supply.

- *How do I know how much tokens am I eligible to?*
You do not need to farm points, or anything. Rather the amount of $WTN is shown on the Dapp:

@bjoernek parameters look good?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-06-07 09:00:57 UTC | #8

I just had a quick look and found some inconsistencies
- minimum_direct_participation_icp: The forum posts (and the comments in the init file) mention a min target of 200k ICP, while the actual value in the init file is 250k ICP. 
- maximum_direct_participation_icp: the max value the forum posts mentions 420k ICP (and also the comment in the init file) but the actual value in the init file is 350k ICP. 
- minimum_participant_icp: The forum post states 1 ICP while the init file states 10 ICP. 
- For the team allocation you mention 22M WTN in the comments of the init file, but the init file specifies 22.4M WTN

I halted my review at this point :-)  I recommend conducting a thorough review on your end and updating the community with the finalized suggested values.

-------------------------

WaterNeuron | 2024-06-08 06:30:42 UTC | #9

Thanks for the feedback! We updated all the parameters accordingly.

Just FYI, we need to keep track of two .yaml because the one used for the SNS is not exactly the same as the file for https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing.

minimum_icp in one, minimum_direct_participation_icp in the other
neurons_fund_participation is a bool in one, neurons_fund_investment_icp is a number.

I think this is because in sns-testing, they're still using an old version of the SNS.

See update from evening of June 9: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/waterneuron-sns-dao-launch/31464/21?u=skilesare

Update on June 14: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/waterneuron-sns-dao-launch/31464/44?u=skilesare

(As of morning June 9)

I'd recommend ~~rejecting the Water Neuron proposal unless~~ changes similar to the following are made to both the yaml and the stated goals/operation of the project:

1. The team allocation should be much less. Potentially 0. The proposed system is a 'turn it on and leave it' type utility. I have no issue with the team making a good bit of value here, and if Water Neuron ends up bringing significant value to the IC then Enzo and Leo(and any other team members) should earn the right to never have to work on anything they don't want to.  But the current 20% level is much higher than almost all SNSs before them and gives an unbounded stake of something that could become a significant portion of IC itself.  This team allocation can be moved to the treasury where they will have significant access to fund almost any work for the DAO that they want to do and that has existing restrictions on it via the NNS(in withdraw limits).

~~2. If the team does take a team share, the vesting period should be staggered over 5 years, not 1. One year is over in the blink of an eye and if they want an unbounded upside it should require significant dedication. I'm not a fan of the SNS setup for team stakes because there is no way to recover them if the person disappears from the project. It makes much more sense to actively manage any vestings from the DAO itself with the ability to recall for abandonment or other misaligned behavior.~~

*The web team has extended lock up to over three years. I still think there is a better way to do this with snss, but they are using the tools they have*

3. The DAO should be capped at a maximum number of nICP.  I'm not sure we want to encourage the unbounded collection of voting power by any one DAO. It seems like a bad practice.  This number can be high so that the DAO has significant returns and budget.  A number like 1% of ICP would give something like $24,000,000 in return to the WTN members from nICP holders at a 5% return on 6 month neurons at $10 ICP. If ICP goes to $100 the numbers start to get crazy.  The treasury will have 10% of that return to spend on development and rewarding contributors(up to 30% of that if the team allocation is reduced).

~~4. The DAO needs to be much more explicit about the long-term value that it will provide to the general IC community. This is a ton of power to give a DAO. Enzo and Leo have a ton to give the DAO as long-time contributors to the IC.  I'd really like to see a specific plan of how they'll contribute to replica safety and how they will expand that vision with the returns the DAO receives.~~

*The team has already built some replica verification tools and has indicated that they plan to build more. As significant constrictors to the IC I think it is rational to extend them the benefit of the doubt on this and look forward to seeing more plan. I would still love to see concrete plans for what the returns on the treasury WTN will be used for or if it will be be committed to stay in the treasury for a certain amount of time*

5. Remove the Neuron Fund request unless the team allocation is moved to a very low number.  The Neuron Fund is just handing a bunch of value to the founders in this current set up with only a 1 year vesting and code that will run on its own once deployed.  I know of two other groups looking at launching the same concept with a near-zero team allocation and it doesn't make sense for the NF to give away that much value for this particular algorithmic concept. 

6. We still need to really understand what effect liquid staking(riskless staking) is going to have on the IC. I've created a thread(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dark-matter-or-do-you-know-where-your-icp-bags-value-is-going/31685) for that issue(along with transferable neurons and bribes).  If someone comes along and offers WTN a significant return for buying it's votes, does a faceless, anon DAO have the moral willpower to turn that down? I'm not sure we know the answer to that and if we are going to experiment, we should probably have some caps on things.

---------

Water Neuron could be an amazing utility for the IC if it is set up correctly. I want Enzo and Leo to be crazy-successful AND for it to benefit from the IC.  I do not think it would be difficult to come into alignment with these things and launch a seriously interesting experiment on the IC.

If the WTN team disagrees with any of these I'll be happy to be convinced otherwise and I think a public debate about them would actually be really constructive for teams that come after them.

Edit: fixed name.
Edit 2: added link to update post.
Edit 3: strike through on 2,4

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-06-09 14:38:53 UTC | #11

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on my previous comments. I'd like to address your points systematically and factually:

### 1. Team Allocation

Comparing team allocation percentages with other projects:

* ICPSwap: 26% Team allocation / 26% Swap
* OpenChat: 23% Team allocation / 25.1% Swap
* HotOrNot: 25.75% Team Allocation / 33% Swap
* Neutrinite: 20% Team Allocation / 30% Swap
* Sonic: 20.5% Team Allocation / 21% Swap

**WaterNeuron: 19.3% Team Allocation / 24.7% Swap**
With the large amount of ICP deposited in those swap teams control a much larger portion of ICP. Contrary to what you pointed out, WaterNeuron's team allocation of 19.3% is slightly lower compared to other projects. This aligns with industry norms and is on the conservative side. This fact could support the argument that the allocation is reasonable and perhaps even modest.

### 2. Locking Period

While a 5-year vesting period may seem extensive, some industry examples show a range of vesting periods. If DFINITY seeds vest over 4 years, a 3-year vesting period for WaterNeuron could be a reasonable compromise. Lengthier vesting periods often aim to ensure long-term commitment and alignment with the project's success.

### 3. Rewards Distribution

Regarding the reward distribution and the calculations, the example given:

> "At 1% of the supply, with 1 swap there will be 47,863 ICP distributed every year."

If there is any misunderstanding in calculations, the provided spreadsheet should clarify it. Ensuring clarity in reward mechanisms is crucial for stakeholder confidence.

### 4. Identifying Key Stakeholders

The mention of "Max" seems to be a misunderstanding. If it was meant to reference someone not relevant, correcting such details is important for accuracy.

### 5. Inclusion in Neuron Fund

Decisions regarding the Neuron Fund should indeed follow the set rules, and discussions about fund contributions need to adhere to these guidelines:

> DFINITY's voting on upcoming SNS launch proposals [https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543].

Understanding the contribution limits and the rationale behind previous funding decisions can provide context for current proposals. Comparing WaterNeuron's hard cap of 70k ICP with other funded projects shows a relatively conservative approach.

### 6. Understanding Liquid Staking

Liquid staking is a complex yet crucial concept. Continuous learning and understanding these mechanisms will enhance discussions and decisions. If further clarification is needed, there are numerous resources available for detailed study.

### Conclusion

While the feedback was direct, it's important to ensure the conversation remains constructive and fact-based. Addressing potential misunderstandings and providing clear, logical responses can help in maintaining a healthy discourse around the project's development and its potential impact.

Your engagement and critique, even if perceived as critical, can drive improvements and clarity. Ensuring accuracy and mutual understanding should be the goal of such discussions. If there are further specific points or clarifications needed, a detailed and objective analysis would be beneficial for all stakeholders involved.

Hey @0rions, 
Hope you're doing great!

I agree with @skilesare's recommendation to reject the proposal, unless more long-term clearly-communicated value is introduced or unless the team's share is cut significantly.

What is the roadmap of this project? In any vesting scenario (1 year, 4 years, 15 years - whatever) what will the team do during these years? What happens after that?

Thanks for the data. My understanding came from some discussions after there was significant blow back from the early SNS allocation and I had understood that the allocations had come dow to around 15 as a standard. Looks like some of the more recent ones have started climbing back up. 

The point remains that it is a large allocation for a perpetual motion machine(even an incredibly valuable one). Many of those have significant commitments for future developments. Some(the dexes) I'd argue are in the same boat as this where they are ultimately "turn on and let run" utilities. I'm just one small vote so the general community may feel differently, and like I said, I'm happy for folks to get externally rich for delivering value, but uncapped on something that could attract a massive amount(and even replace the nns dash as the primary place to stake) seems to create a long term imbalance in the future universes where you are successful.

Seems reasonable. Just speaking from my own experiences where I've been in the negative end of five year vestings, and even still I can see the benefit of long term holdbacks for incentive alignment.  I still think the treasury and dao should handle these, perhaps with some kind of smart contract that protects both dao and founders.

This was a strange typo since I had Enzo mentioned later. Fixed and sorry about that.

[/quote]

Those are the base rules. The NNS still gets to make a judgement call. Because of the base mechanism that you guys are employing thru seems like gifting 20% of the fund input to founders. If you guys can convince the NNS that that gift is worth it, go for it. I think it's high. Maybe every contribution has been higher.( I wouldn't give the neuron find great scores for quality investments at this point).

Regarding the misunderstanding in payouts, I may have miscommunicated or misunderstood . I'll try to work off your sheet and demonstrate what I mean and revert. The moral of the story was that even with 1% of the IC total supply ending up in nICP you guys do super well and that considering a cap could make the whole thing a bit more aligned.  Maybe it's 2 or 3z at some point it becomes the WTN network if unbounded and I think that is a situation to plan for and avoid.

Let me try to get to a computer tonight and work on the payouts for that.  Basically the view would be here:here is what the team will make per ICP staked an nICP going from 0 to 51% of ICP supply.

I'm not sure what is going on with Taler, but if anyone is going to build some of these DeFi experiments it is likely these guys who've been building the IC for a number of years. I think we need to voice concerns and then let them answer. Every question I've asked has at least had a well thought out answer(even if I ultimately disagree...and we'll have plenty of disagreements in a decentralized error..that is good, expected, and how we innovate).

I agree.  I had a similar experience as you when I first responded to the WaterNeuron announcement on the forum, joined the WaterNeuron community on Telegram, and participated in their first 4 hours Twitter live session.  They certainly have the skills to pull off this project and have given deep consideration to all concerns that I raised.  They were even willing to listen to the community on several design decision for WaterNeuron (e.g. following the SNS vote instead of automatic no votes on all NNS proposals).  Their ability to review a technical proposal under pressure of an audience was impressive and I appreciate their intention of development of tools that can help automate some of the technical code reviews for the community.  I don't think they are going to use the NNS neurons as a way to simply drain voting rewards from the NNS...instead I think they will likely make beneficial contributions to NNS governance on technical topics.  However, those contributions are not as concrete as I'd prefer to see at this point.  Hence, your point number 4 resonates with me.  I'd like to see more explicit definition of the long-term value that WaterNeuron can provide to the ICP ecosystem, especially since WaterNeuron has the potential to harness a ton of voting power if they are successful, which I think is a realistic probability.

[quote="skilesare, post:10, topic:31464"]
4. The DAO needs to be much more explicit about the long-term value that it will provide to the general IC community. This is a ton of power to give a DAO.

I also think that the team allocation should be less, focusing on the long-term value of this project. This project will be as successful as stETH. It is very difficult to directly participate in eth pos, but through stETH, participation becomes very easy. WaterNeuron should attract more people to participate in sns and produce more benefits for icp defi.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-06-10 03:59:38 UTC | #21


A couple of notes while I have a second.  Had some great back and forth with Leo from the WTN team.

There is a tough dichotomy in this SNS stuff where you have a project that is trying to launch a platform that they have poured a good bit of time, energy, and money into. Every one puts their best foot forward and wants to appear like an invincible force with guaranteed success. But often you are just trying to will something into the world. Then you make one of these proposals and everyone starts judging your project as if you are possibly one of the most morally corrupt people in the world and/or about to achieve success beyond your wildest imagination.  Such is the place you put yourself in with one of these things and there is a lot unfair about it and yet it is the "job" of the NNS to vet the thing appropriately and consider all the edge cases. That is a really tough equation and it puts the people we most want to incentivize (devs) on the opposite side of the table as the vetting group(the community.) As a participant on both sides of the table, this dynamic really sucks.  I'm not quite sure what to do about it, but async communication and winner take all twitter slap fights don't help the situation. I often feel I have to constantly apologize for just saying words. How do we get everyone on the same side of the table? Hopefully SNS soft launch and migratory pathways that are on the roadmap will help.

In case it isn't clear, I'm rooting for this to be a successful project and think that with a couple tweeks it can be very well positioned to give us some interesting info on how this coin governance thing is going to pan out. My arguments are from an assumption that WTN will be wildly successful to the extent that they become the dominant staking platform on the IC and most of my concerns stem from that extreme.

To be fair to WTN, we are a long way from that and the NNS will enable them to make adjustments along the way if a major issue arises. 

Leo has convinced me that it may not be paramount to solve all the issues now and that the upside from building a strong governance DAO is a critical need now.

If the protocol needs to be capped later, it can be. On the other hand, if a cap exists than it can be removed later. My current thought is that the second is a safer approach and not much of a cost to the project at this time.

If the amount of possible VP the water neuron can control were say capped at 2% in the smart contract and it would take an NNS vote to change it, I think a healthy team allocation and NF involvement is much more justifiable.(we already have a motion proposal to reevaluate everything if canister control gets to more than 10% of vp, so this leaves room for a few other experiments and creates a nice sand box for observation.) I need to run the numbers, but I'm pretty sure that at 2% VP the founders, the dao and most everyone will be pretty damn happy about how things turned out.

Another advantage of this is that if WTN is able to get to 2% we will have a ton more data about how it is being used and what the effects on decentralization are and to get a lens on the existential problems that may exist with risk-less staking.

I'm not sure what or if the team will do anything along those lines, but it was a good conversation and the team really knows its stuff and product.

In summary, a cap would help alleviate  my concerns 1,3 and 5 and give us time and space to explore 6.

With issue 3 they've suggested maybe 3 years which is better than 1.

That leave 2 which is the value question and the team certainly has the chops to handle that  and will have a three year incentive alignment set up. More detail on how that will work and what the exact contribution would be welcome and also if the returns from the treasury WTN will be used for those purposes(Could the DAO fund code audits of other projects or replica validation software or canister penetration testing frameworks, etc)

I really appreciate the time taken to talk to me about it.

0rions | 2024-06-10 09:57:36 UTC | #22

Hey @skilesare, thanks for updating everyone on our discussions. 

Increasing the vesting schedule makes sense, that's why it's now configured for up to 3 years to make sure we're aligned.

Now regarding the cap, this protocol has an implied cap. As the protocol grows the yield you get will tend to be slightly below what the NNS offers.
![Screenshot from 2024-06-10 11-47-02|490x373](upload://deDCrKGlpwuIHLrnOEEpjniYdIX.png)

You can find the spreadsheet here and play with it by yourself: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8JXo8xOB786usk8BaWPPcBJB7oFR0HWvA5y8kcfRqU/edit#gid=746571094

Regarding future work, we already have a replica build tool verifier ready to be deployed. This is the first time such a tool has been built by community members. We also have a lot of ideas to develop and test, but first, we need to make this work.

[/quote]

I'd be 100% on board with an algorithmic cap that tapered out the returns. That would be a natural way for the platform to self reg via the market.

The issue with this chart is that the bottom is 7.42 and the current rate for a 6m is 7.5.

There are a large number of universes where .08 percent + instant liquidity if a free option and no rational actor would choose traditional staking. If we find our selves in one of those, nICP could grow unbounded.

There are also a large number of universes where retail piles into Mother and 7.42 and 7.5 are irrelevant.

Cannot go to 0? Or at a tipping point could it accelerate to 0?  This would cause a natural mint/burn cycle even in those universes where the free option is worth it at a 5% discount. And it takes the decisions out of human hands which could be good for keeping the meddlesome token architects out of future discussions. 😬

I understand your critiques and I think public debate is healthy, but don't understand why you would vote to reject the proposal to launch the SNS. If you don't like the tokenomics or the structure, don't participate in the SNS sale. Voting to reject the proposal seems like an unnecessary attack on the project.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-06-10 15:16:00 UTC | #25

There are a number of reasons, existential and practical. Let's set aside the existential for as we've discussed how those can be mitigated.

The project is asking for 70k ICP (> $700,000) from the neuron fund to seed the attractiveness of nICP. This increases scrutiny on a practical level as NF holders need to ask if the investment of that money in this project is 'worth it'.  The NF participation ramps up pretty quickly and can end up being a huge part of the investment(see https://nns.ic0.app/project/?project=gyito-zyaaa-aaaaq-aacpq-cai).

Perhaps the NNS shouldn't be voting on the NF participation, but for now, it is and so anyone asking for these funds should expect scrutiny from the community.

Many SNS projects specifically refused NF funds for this specific reason.  The NF is probably why there was a rush of not-ready-for-prime-time SNSs and now here it is causing more scrutiny than you would like for a project you are a fan of.

If water neuron were launching without NF participation I likely would not have recommended outright rejection(which I'm pretty close to no longer recommending) and would have focused on the existential issues that we need to monitor and why we need to monitor them.

I do think the bar for rejecting an SNS that doesn't request NF funds is much lower/almost non-existent (perhaps porn/outright legal activities should still be reject) than one that does.

In Water Neuron's case I think the large team allocation coupled with the short team lock-up was a red flag for the NF.  Extending the lock-up reduces that significantly, which sounds like it is being considered.  The NF can't just hand massive chunks of ICP to Founders and let them run off with the ICP and stay in existence for long. I'm in no way implying that I think WTN team would do that, but they have ways to ensure that they don't which I've recommended.

I'd highly recommend separating the NF vote from the actual SNS vote for everyone, but that is an NNS governance matter. (Even better to let an SNS launch in a disconnected state and then 'upgrade' into the SNS. once they've demonstrated competence and value. As a bonus this would make the swaps self-run and would alleviate the issues that my lawyers have advised me about where US citizens who vote to launch a token swap could be held liable for any litigation and/or regulatory violations...currently ICDevs has to reject ALL SNSs and I do so as well with my private neurons for (my stupid country's)regulatory protection).  I've discussed a good bit of this before(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icdevs-votes-on-sns-and-nns-proposals/17073). It is a contested topic, but I've chosen to be safe until the US further defines it's rules and regulations.

Upgrading a set of canisters to move from one subnet to another or to be included in a list would have no rational legal consequences, especially if the token had been previously launched and demonstrated utility.

I believe it’s imperative to deeply analyze projects with a healthy amount of disagreement and scrutiny should there be any. 

However I do empathize with the feeling of being villainized while you (a dev) just want to bring your idea to life.
That can be incredibly frustrating as well as disheartening. 

I will say though that something that frequently crosses my mind is the general crypto sentiment of “Don’t Trust, Verify.” Not sure if that is relevant to ICP but it is a common idiom among hardcore bitcoiners. Although I would say this sentiment permeates much of blockchain & smart contract technology itself which seeks to create trustless systems that are enacted without fault. So I believe our need to verify that our precious blockchain is not tampered with is paramount.

I sometimes struggle to fully adopt other aspects of blockchain like allowing people to create freely without censorship and in a sovereign way. There are some projects on the IC that I’m not a fan of whether it be because it’s a meme I don’t care for or because a project does not seem it is or will be particularly successful but regardless I’ve learned to be excited for the unique way in which creation of the DAOs and dApps on ICP is. So in some sense it’s all for the better.

I wasn’t going anywhere particular with these notes but figured I’d share my thoughts. I’ll end by saying that helping people to understand the security features and protective measures available to the Internet Computer to ensure that malintent does not gain a foothold can reduce these instances of hostility towards new projects. As well as providing more visibility for projects in development because sometimes I feel like SNS proposals come out of nowhere and I’m not sure where to see how much developement and work has gone into a dApp. These are some of my thoughts.

This will not happen as everything will be staked in an 8-year neuron, and at launch, SNS-swap participant + NF will have the majority. 

> In Water Neuron’s case I think the large team allocation coupled with the short team lock-up was a red flag for the NF.

We raised lock-up up to 3 years. On a side note, as long as your project is not widely successful no one can sell. There is a natural "lock-up" until you get somewhat successful because as long as there is no interest in your project you can't sell anyway.

Awesome. And great point.

Any thoughts on accelerating the nICP rate to 0 after like 1 or 2% of ICP supply? I think that would form a natural barrier to give you guys wild success and make sure the platform doesn't gin too much dominance. With that kind of set up I think the team allocation is much better balanced with the health of the ecosystem.(it also incentivizes WTN unless you find another use for the gap.)

In general I'd be super interested in the effect of what a 1% of ICP as liquid stake does for general liquidity. Like is that plenty or far from enough. I'm not even sure where to start looking for that kind of info.

[/quote]
I agree, we haven't seen the effect so far. If you look on [DefiLlama's dashboard for $ICP](https://defillama.com/chain/ICP), or any other tracking tool. You quickly come to the realisation that the top DEX on chain with a FDV of ~$6 billions should have a TVL way higher than what they have currently. With unlocked liquidity of let's say 1% of the total supply (~ 5'190'185 $ICP, or ~50'000'000 $USD), each DEX should have increased TVL and depth of order book/size of liquidity pool. This would benefit the whole ecosystem. 

A project that is unrelated to DEFI most likely has a token, for their token to be interesting you should be able to offload your position or increase your current one rather rapidly. Without increased liquidity that is currently unmanageable.  **The newfound liquidity should be an extra incentive for new developers to build on ICP, growing the ecosystem and kick starting DEFI!**

Hey there, @DEF 
It is nice to see IC-focused auditors emerge in the ecosystem.

Is there any way to see your portfolio? What other projects have you audited before?
I tried googling myself, but only thing I found is a twitter account with two posts from 2020.

Have great day!

@senior.joinu, the DEF didn't conduct the audit. The audit was "conducted by a qualified researcher with expertise in the Internet Computer ecosystem" who wishes to remain anonymous "to maintain impartiality and objectivity". The DEF's role was in verifying the researcher's identity and confirming their qualifications.

Aaah, I see. Thanks a lot for the clarification!

But... since the audit is already performed, isn't it safe to reveal the auditor's identity? 
Even if somebody would try to affect their judgement, they already did their job and can't update the verdict right?

@senior.joinu, I’m not part of the team and I have no inside information: I just know what was written on the attestation and the audit report. That said, Foundation employees are probably the most qualified persons to conduct an audit of a staking protocol built on the IC, and I don’t think I’d want my identity to be known if I worked for the Foundation and conducted an audit.

Sure.

A good auditor, IMO, has 3 following traits:
1. They are experienced in reviewing similar projects, so they can quickly spot common bugs.
2. They are not affiliated with my team, so the audit is more objective.
3. (most important) They have reputation, so when they vouch for the quality of our code and something goes wrong, they will also suffer from the damage. 

Anonymity is not a problem - I appreciate anonymity and I believe we should all be able to do stuff anonymously, when we need it.

And I can clearly see the reasoning behind the audit being conducted by a former colleague from the Foundation - you may get a better quality code review for a lower price this way (or even for a cup of coffee and pizza). This is absolutely appropriate for a bug-seeking peer review, but not for an official pre-launch audit with a report and everything.

The problem is reputation. If they risk nothing, their words worth nothing. The audit is a vouching event.

Seems like @DEF is in the role of reputation source in this case. But they don't have any. 
This is their first post at the forum. [Their socials](https://x.com/defoundation_) are empty. [Their website](https://de-foundation.org/) is empty. I tried finding out more info about it, and it seems like they are the guys [behind Gold DAO](https://daolink.org/about) and [Bochsler Finance](https://bochslerfinance.com/). But you have to dig to find that info, which means that they don't want these brands to associate with each other - otherwise they would cross-reference each right on their landing pages.

I'm sorry for being like that, but it just makes no sense. 
Running a public sale, your first priority is to reveal as many details about the project as possible in the most transparent way you can think of. 
So, the most fool-proof step here would be to get super-ordinary code audit from a super-common auditor, like Trail of Bits. This would certainly raise zero questions from the community, because ToB are well-known and people trust their judgements when it comes to the IC. (because they vouched for the IC and the IC vouched for them in return)
Instead you find an anonymous, with zero official conducted audits and zero reputation. And then you find an entity, who has reputation but hides it, to vouch for that anonymous auditor. Makes no sense to me.

**The IC has a liquidity issue.** In other blockchain networks, staked tokens are often tradable, allowing for greater liquidity and participation in DeFi activities. However, on $ICP, staked tokens are not tradable.

 This design choice is intended to prevent malicious flash  actions that could compromise the NNS, which seats as the core  governance mechanism of the network. While this approach enhances  security and stability, it also locks away significant capital.

Currently, approximately $2.5 billion is locked away and unable  to participate in DeFi activities. This restriction limits the  potential for these funds to be utilized in various DeFi protocols,  reducing overall liquidity and economic activity within the ICP  ecosystem.

![image|617x500, 100%](upload://vuizqYlKEgv4GJAWi9kUggK93Rg.jpeg)

The effects are evident on-chain. If you look at DefiLlama’s dashboard for $ICP, you quickly realize that the top DEX on chain with a FDV of $6 billion should have a TVL way higher than what they have currently. This is through no fault of their own, it's because of liquidity!

![image|690x212](upload://tNBuCUXMJN91dgfFNyAMpdOanqd.jpeg)

As the liquidity is simply not there, there needs to be a plan to bring it to DEFI. The goal of [@waterneuron](https://x.com/waterneuron) is to unlock that liquidity! By having a token that delivers early higher yield than the NNS. Fully on-chain. Fully decentralized project from day 1.

To achieve this, WaterNeuron needs to be interesting in a couple of ways: 

- **yield-wise** -  WaterNeuron offers a yield that is initially much higher than the NNS. The yield for $nICP, the token representing staked ICP in WaterNeuron, is designed to be attractive to early users. The yield will eventually settle around 7.2% to 7.3%, which is competitive with the NNS. The yield of $nICP only drops below the NNS when the TVL reaches approximately $100 million. ![image|645x500](upload://6jMRMIkRLF7dTUiGY2yFMphV0GT.jpeg)

- **airdrop** - To incentivize early adoption, WaterNeuron will conduct an airdrop of $WTN tokens. This airdrop will continue until around 10 million $nICP tokens are minted. This strategy aims to attract users and increase the initial liquidity of the protocol. 
![image|466x482](upload://9eLkuE14ZyNQgXbGswMHoZMPQYk.png)

- **liquidity** -  Unlike NNS neurons, which are not tradable as they represent voting power, $nICP does not represent voting power and is only associated with yield. This design choice allows $nICP to be traded freely, thereby enhancing liquidity within the ICP ecosystem. ![image|690x302](upload://1Q255OxDtpuwaCgp4P18CInjESp.jpeg)

## Why does this benefit the IC ecosystem? 
 If 1% of all ICP tokens (approximately 5,190,185 ICP or around $50 million USD) are swapped for $nICP, it would significantly increase the TVL and depth of order books/liquidity pools on each DEX within the ICP ecosystem. This increase in liquidity would have a trickle-down effect, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Projects unrelated to DeFi, which often have their own tokens, would also benefit as increased liquidity would make it easier to offload or increase positions rapidly. This newfound liquidity would serve as an extra incentive for new developers to build on ICP, thereby growing the ecosystem and kick-starting DeFi activities.

**Without increased liquidity, that is currently unmanageable.  The newfound liquidity should be an extra incentive for new developers  to build on ICP, growing the ecosystem and kick-starting DEFI!**

WaterNeuron | 2024-06-13 12:55:05 UTC | #41

All of the points you mentioned make absolute sense. To launch, we needed an audit from an external auditor who was as qualified as possible. But we want to do an audit with Trail of Bits for sure for the exact reasons you mentioned in your post, now the question is when. We are already talking to them the only issue is that these audits take a lot of time and they tend to be pretty busy as they are probably the most popular auditors in a lot of areas.

Now regarding the foundation, it is a publicly registered foundation in Switzerland: https://stiftungen.stiftungschweiz.ch/organisation/fondation-pour-les-entites-decentralisees-decentralized-entities-foundation. It's goal is to develop Decentralize Autonomous Organizations such as WaterNeuron. Sorry if this wasn't clear in the original post.

> The problem is reputation. If they risk nothing, their words worth nothing. The audit is a vouching event.

This is unfortunately not true, in reality, the only thing that matters is the quality of the auditor. For the broad public, the name is worth something but as you can find numerous examples on https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/, code that has been audited by these firms is regularly hacked and the auditing firms are not closing down after these unfortunate events.

At this point I'm no longer recommending rejection, if for no other reason than gates are generally bad and that if something is a long term safety issue then it should be addressed head-on rather than asking people to block access.  In that vein, I do still recommend one of the following actions be taken for network safety(I've listed them in my current preferences, but I think the debate and research is far from over). @WaterNeuron is right to question if this is a realistic issue or not and we will certainly see as the platform launches:

1. Change the contract such that the return on nICP accelerates to 0 after total ICP locked in the contract reaches 1% of ICP. This builds a market driven cap on likely ICP out into a single platform. You could even launch WTN2 when you get close to this. Why? Having different DAOs with diverging priorities and different voting blocks helps maintain decentralization. We are in a strange place right now where something like WaterNeuron can help decentralization by gaining voting power while also reducing centralization by concentrating VP in the hands of WTN holders. Once more than -1% of VP is held by WTN holders I'd suggest that the script starts to flip and that further concentration of VP in WTN holders becomes "bad" for the network, but that a second, third, nth, etc similar structures may continue to good to diversify away from the current DFINITY concentration. Unfortunately, once we have whole DAOs controlling 1% blocks it may be very hard to roll back. These chunky voting blocks can give a parliamentary feel where fringe small groups get an elevated say in governance(see ch. 13, Choices http://amzn.to/2jt3xrT).  The ability for DAOs to hold VP may be indirectly leading to a multi-party governance that we can't unwind, thus capping it at a small amount now gives optionally down the road.

2. Hard cap. Same as 1, possibly easier to code.

3. NNS motion to cap any one DAO at 1% VP and future forced installation of an upgraded WTN contract with a cap in it. We already have a passed proposal to reevaluate the entire canisters holding neurons issue when we reach 10% VP. The waterneuron contract is controlled by the NNS and thus the NNS can vote to upgrade it to any contract it sees fit. I'd prefer self regulation and best practices standardization as mentioned in 1 or 2 as this third option may be very hard, if not impossible to pull off due to ideological reasons even if the network is at serious risk.

What is the risk if no action is taken? The viral and value loop in WTN is very well designed. The minimum return on a 6 month neuron staked via waterneuron, even when something like 2% of ICP is in the system is only a few fractions of a percent less than the standard six month rate in the NNS. Liquidity is likely with far more than those few small points. A rational person with full information would likely have to be very confused to stake in the NNS once water neuron exists. This, coupled with the fact that 8 year neurons get only a straight line bonus,  could lead to a runaway loop where WaterNeuron(and/or copycat platforms) becomes the defacto staking platform for the IC and no more ICP is individually staked on the NNS. The WTN is less aggressive about the take up of the platform than I am and it is possible that I've missed a particular variable that makes nICP less attractive at high ICP locked value, but according to the provided xls the rate it very close to par with a 6M neuron.

(These restrictions may need/should exist for the @GeekFactory riskless staking platform as well, but I have been in vacation this week and have not even had a chance to read the announcement, much less the code.)

I haven't had a chance to look at the contract code in any depth at this point and my rust is a bit rusty, but I'd expect an insertion point for 1 where the amount of maturity distributed to WTN from the 6M neuron could increase from 10  to 100 after a certain point.

For 2, the contract could just stop processing deposits after a certain point and refund ICP instead.

This analysis has unfortunately intersected with some time on vacation I've had very limited time to do any deep review or audit, but my concern for a runaway scenario seemed to warrant staring some discussion.  Thanks to the WTN team for the interaction.

Doesn't liquid staking undo the point of staking? ICP is staked for voting in order to tie voters to the outcome of their vote. This liquidity *problem* is by design isn't it? If it's a real problem, wouldn't the solution be to remove the need to stake tokens in the first place, rather than to design a system to subvert the way that staking was intended?

I have the same question.  It’s really a question for DFINITY I think.  They created our current time bound staking system, but now they seem to be willing to make canister controlled neuron easy.  Instead of making it easier to transfer neurons, why not just get rid of the need for liquid neurons altogether.   It seems cleaner to make staked ICP liquid by getting rid of the neuron dissolve delay.  I’m not sure why this hasn’t been part of the discussion.

[/quote]

Hello there, @Lorimer and @wpb. I agree it might be counterintuitive. However, ICP is in a unique position thanks to the NNS framework!

 **The NNS is all-powerful, from the nodes it controls to the subnets they are part of, the canisters that run, the ledgers, and even managing itself!** People decide every proposal in the NNS, the people, the network is a [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy)!

How do you ensure people vote in a referendum, especially when so much is at stake? I think pride of the network and how much you care about the issue play significant roles. In the NNS, there is an extra incentive with tokens. Some of us like to vote and happily take time every day, while others follow trusted neurons and their ways of doing things (codegov, etc.).

**Others who are only here for the yield**—this kind of people do not exist in the real world. These people here for yield only weigh in on the everyday governance of the system; they would gladly take the yield and go home, but instead, they have to vote. **I believe they represent a threat to the network.**

**WaterNeurons' design neutralizes them. They can still have a high yield, but they hand their voting power to the WaterNeuron DAO, who will, in turn, make an informed decision.**

![image|690x342](upload://mcLCG3VPNEm9MqljUIzgNNRE7co.jpeg)

In this context, liquid staking does not undermine the purpose of staking but enhances it by offering flexibility and liquidity while ensuring the network remains secure and effectively governed.

![eits(24)|690x272](upload://gfuMKNt0hNmrIrAUmmX5WnluWlG.jpeg)

 It allows participants to engage in other financial activities without sacrificing their staking rewards, broadening the appeal and utility of staking within the ecosystem.

edit: @Lorimer pointed out I was overly simple in the description of the NNS!

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-15 11:56:44 UTC | #48

Couldn't you reframe this whole narrative as 'WaterNeuron buys votes, and votes the way it wants with the voting power that it's purchased"?

I do believe this to be true.  WaterNeuron seems to be well positioned to make a big improvement to NNS governance, which I think is very exciting.  You and @0rions have the perfect skills and network to develop the tools and app to make the project a success.  I greatly appreciate that you plan to use the NNS voting power that will come from the WTN neurons in a way that will advance decentralization of NNS governance in a healthy way.  I’m very impressed and I plan to participate.

I’m just not sure that NNS governance still needs to be based on neurons with dissolve delays if we are going to break the time locked commitment.  You could still have governance that is based on staked ICP and liquid democracy (using the Followee system) without the dissolve delay parameter for neurons.  Long term staking could be rewarded using an amplified age bonus instead of a dissolve delay bonus (e.g. max 2x age bonus at an 8 year cap).  The older the neuron, the more painful it would be to liquidate, but neuron owners would be free to liquidate a portion of their staked ICP instead of needing to liquidate the neuron itself.

Don’t get me wrong, I still prefer the original design intent of long term commitment using dissolve delays.  I thought that was a reasonable fundamental design feature of ICP tokenomics.  However, if DFINITY is going to acquiesce to community demand for commercial option for neuron transfer (such as idgeek, stakegeek, WaterNeuron), then I think it’s reasonable to consider if neuron transfer should be necessary when all we need to do is remove the dissolve delay.

Couldn’t you reframe this whole narrative as 'WaterNeuron buys votes, and votes the way it wants with the voting power that it’s purchased"?
[/quote]

Users mint $nICP with $ICP, and that $ICP gets locked. Locked $WTN holders vote for all the $ICP staked on the protocol. I'm not sure where you see the buying of the votes happening.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-15 12:10:30 UTC | #51

Users are offered financial reward to lend their voting power to WaterNeuron (this can be described as buying votes in my opinion). Please help me see the difference :slightly_smiling_face:

Another interesting point is that locked $WTN holders control the WaterNeuron vote, and are offered a staking bonus. Isn't this essentially the model you say you're trying to move away from (staked ICP for which voters receive a staking bonus)?

However, if DFINITY is going to acquiesce to community demand for commercial option for neuron transfer (such as idgeek, stakegeek, WaterNeuron), then I think it’s reasonable to consider if neuron transfer should be necessary when all we need to do is remove the dissolve delay.

If you remove the dissolve delay, someone could come and stake everything, vote on the outcome they prefer, and then leave the system again immediately! Which I personally think is detrimental to the system.

Not in my eyes. In the current model, some people come to vote **just** to earn voting rewards. Hence they're not preoccupied by the voting outcome, which is an issue when the NNS controls the entire network. You can't have people who vote just to vote without much concern with the issue at hand in a direct democracy system. 

In the WaterNeuron DAO system, they still earn the yield they were after without engaging in governance. $WTN stakers handle the governance aspect for them instead, so they don't have to vote whatever just to get yield.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-15 12:32:14 UTC | #54

**But IC isn't a direct democracy... it's a liquid democracy**. Anyone interested in yield over voting will set up neurons to follow, and they're incentivised to follow the most active neurons that have the networks best interests (and therefore their stake) at heart.

It sounds like **the whole premise for WaterNeuron is based on a strawman argument**. Can you agree that it's very misleading to keep describing IC as a direct democracy (regardless of what the default state of a new neuron is)?

~~Completely separately from the above concern, another is that the holders of $WTN can fall foul of the very problem you're trying to solve (unless I'm mistaken on this part - please correct me if so). Essentially, **how do you make sure $WTN holders vote responsibly, instead of just seeking their yield?**~~ I've reread your answer, and see that I missed your point - 'they still earn the yield they were after without engaging in governance'. But of course, the current status quo is such that ICP stakers still earn their yield, even if they don't manually vote...

Thanks, exactly! I think this status-quo is an issue for people who are only here for the yield. I personally think offering them an alternative where they can still earn yield and not vote is a better outcome!

How is this different than liquid neurons?  Other than the fact that liquid neurons are typically sold at a discount relative to the time locked ICP in the neuron.  Doesn’t discounted ICP actually make the liquid neurons more detrimental to the system?

I recognize that there are two mechanisms for liquidity for WaterNeuron…dissolve your liquidated 6 month neuron and wait or sell it immediately at a discount.  My concern is that we have the ability to sell immediately with all of the commercial options.  That’s where the time locked restriction is broken and why I think the time locked restriction could be removed in a cleaner way.

As a separate concern, I currently have a neuron that I use for voting, and obviously have staked a bunch of ICP to acquire this neuron (just so happens to be staked for 8 years - I'm in it for the long run). Does WTN offer me a convenient way to divorce myself from this long term commitment? Essentially, does it work just as well for ICP that's already been staked, or is it just intended for new ICP that needs staking in a particular way?

Yes, you can already do that in the NNS! However, when you do so your $ICP is locked, only your voting rewards is not. $nICP helps you mitigate that, you do not vote, you earn yield, and you are liquid with the $nICP token.

Lorimer | 2024-06-15 13:29:37 UTC | #59

Thanks for taking the time to go through it with me @EnzoPlayer0ne. My understanding is that WTN's value proposition is that it decouples governance from yield. I can see why this is appealing to individuals driven by short-termism/self-interest. I'm still not clear on why this is a good thing for the long-term health of the network (given that these individuals are already *neutralised* by liquid democracy). Are you able to clarify this particular aspect?

Are you also able to offer any thoughts on why you think IC might have been designed this way - offering yield to voters? Ultimately, this is what WTN attempts to change if I understand correctly.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-06-15 13:32:21 UTC | #60

(I'm moving this conversation to this most recent/active thread).

Is there a reason that liquid staking needs to have voting power at all?
This is intended to be a financial instrument not a “community DAO” correct?

(Just a thought) Let’s say dfinity were able to add a function that liquid staking DAOs/neurons were able to declare itself as such, it could void it’s own voting power in return for receiving the full voting rewards as if it were an active voting neuron staked for the same period e.g 8 years. The maturity would be the same, which is the purpose of liquid staking, but the voting is void. 
As this proposal in its current form poses a substantial threat to the de-centralisation of the ICP and voting. 

Also to clarify, are you planning on receiving ICP from the neurons fund? As I don't see how some of these yield numbers can be met if you are not. 

What you are proposing, is literally the opposite of decentralisation. It is centralising a large amount of voting power. But the purpose is the ROI yes? So voting power should be irrelevant to a liquid staking platform. Do we agree?

It’s also been said that this is to take voting majority away from dfinity, but now instead of voting no to all, you’ll follow the majority votes on the ICP proposals on the NNS an hour or so before expiry.

But you’ve also stated that most neurons follow DFINITY. So in effect you’ll be following the majority which you’ve stated already follow dfinity, which essentially means you’ll be following dfinity for voting.

The difference is, people who follow dfinity can revoke that at any time in their neuron. From what I understand of this, this is irreversible. You get the voting majority of hundreds of thousands of ICP after the SNS launch and people cannot choose to revoke who you are voting on. Is this correct?
It's been stated quite categorically that, first you would be voting no, then this was changed to following the majority of voting on the NNS. This implies that your team, not the community will have the majority of voting power as to how the ICP neuron is voting. Is this correct?

Would you be opposed to revoking voting power if your earned maturity stayed the same as though you were voting on all proposals? (If you are, why?). I also believe a hard cap is necessary on this type of project as the extreme centralisation of voting power this would achieve is worrying to say the least. 

This would still meet the criteria of your goal, which is to achieve a better ROI on liquid staking, but it would not centralise so much voting power. What are your thoughts on that?

Is this possible from dfinity side of things? As in revoking voting power (not the maturity, but voting power) from projects intended to be liquid staking platforms. People are liquid staking for the ROI, not to centralise voting into the hands of a few. 

In terms of the SNS swap what is the breakdown?
Ie how are you able to say “we will vote no on all topics” (I understand that has now changed to "we will vote with the majority on the NNS proposals"), but regardless, how can you say "this is how we will vote", isn’t that up to the community with staked WTN?

Saying this implies that you know factually that you'll have the majority of voting power on the DAO and in turn which way it votes. Is this true?

What is the breakdown of voting power of WTN tokens available to be staked for the community following the launch?
Ie how decentralized is WTN if you’re able to specify in advance what the vote will be?

If the neurons fund does not commit to any of the launches, will you be able to meet the ROI that you've stated?

I'd like to attempt to answer my own question.

> Are you also able to offer any thoughts on why you think IC might have been designed this way - offering yield to voters? Ultimately, this is what WTN attempts to change if I understand correctly.

I expect the answer to this is -  optimism that users would avoid making decisions that are in their short-term interest to the detriment of their long-term interest.

After taking a long bath and some paracetamol (I have a splitting headache - unrelated), I think I've come to terms with Water Neuron (there's some unintended symmetry in this sentence 😂).

My current understanding is that WTN attempts to eliminate short-term/irresponsible thinkers from the pool of individuals that can affect the outcome of an NNS proposal. I believe it attempts to do this, ironically, but enticing them with short-term rewards that tail off over time to the point where they would eventually actually have been financially better off staking their ICP directly in the NNS (unless they were lucky enough to have traded out of their positions at the right times). 

Is this correct @EnzoPlayer0ne?

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-15 20:12:58 UTC | #65

In case the irony is lost on anyone, unless I misunderstand (entirely possible - if so please correct me), I believe the irony is that if WaterNeuron is successful in its mission, it will make it such that nothing else like WaterNeuron will be able to get off the ground as an SNS (because it would require short-termist thinkers to support it, all of whom should have been eliminated as NNS voters).

I do still worry that it seems a little self-defeating in its mission, by using the Neurons Fund to facilitate the enticement of short-termist voters, while constructring strawman arguments to skew perspectives - but that's just my take. I'm interested to see how this all unfolds.

-------------------------

ckMood | 2024-06-15 20:15:15 UTC | #66

I may be reacting sharply here but I believe that if we vote to have dissolve delay removed that could be detrimental to ICP’s entire structure.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-06-16 03:19:22 UTC | #67

Yeah I do not see how these yields would be possible without using the Neurons Fund to achieve such.
 
Well all of our neurons would give better returns if the Neurons Fund just gave us free ICP to stake. 

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong someone from the team, but there is a maximum cap on the SNS participation, yet the ICP numbers used in the calculations for yield etc are more than the cap, this only indicates one thing. The expectation of NF commitment is built into the design of this in order to provide these yields.

There is a word for this, it has just slipped my mind 🤔... You know, when you use other people's (or in this case the community's) money to pay higher returns to early investors. 

I'd like to see a document to show the yields on the off change the NF does not participate.

Very interesting project, I have a few questions
1. What is the link between WTN and nICP?
2. Besides being part of the DAO and being able to vote in the SNS governance, what are the benefits of participating in the SNS? 
3. How exactly are nICP linked to the 6 month neuron? If I buy the nICP on a DEX, how does the system know the amount of rewards I’m eligible for when holding nICP?

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-20 23:04:57 UTC | #71

Having had some time to think through what WaterNeuron is providing, I'm now in favour of this project. Thanks to @EnzoPlayer0ne for being patient with my questioning.

My understanding is that WTN is for voting and earning yield that is initally small in relative terms, but grows over time as more people buy up nICP (thereyby increasing the voting power of WTN holders). WTN seems like a sensible long-term investment (this isn't intended as advice), attracting the sorts of long-term thinkers you'd want for participating in governance.

nICP on the other hand is for allowing staked ICP to change hands, rather than stagnating and not contributing to the economy. nICP holders relinquish the voting power of that ICP to WTN holders. I believe nICP holders will be capable of earning an abnormally high yield in the short and medium term (due to the rewards from the staked ICP put forward by WTN holders during the SNS sale), while approaching levels that are closer to the standard NNS yield in the long term. I think anyone with idle ICP will be highly incentivesed to trade in for nICP, receving 90% of the total yield while WTN holders receive only 10%.

**But**, I think a key detail here is that WTN has a max supply, so that 10% yield should just keep growing (in absolute terms) if I understand correctly. The potential popularity of nICP could stand to make this 10% yield (shared between a fixed number of WTN tokens) pretty sweet in the medium to long term.

Regarding the SNS sale, the benefit of particpating early appears to be the favourable exchange rate for WTN tokens per ICP (divide the amount distributed by the min or max ICP to raise).

**Full disclosure:** I've participated in the WTN sale and may now be wearing rose-tinted glasses. Please don't take any of this as financial advise. I'm more interested in discussing and understanding the potential long term implications for the ecosystem and state of IC governance.

It's also entirely possible that I've misunderstood certain details, so this post is as much an attempt at seeking confirmation from others as it is about answering questions. :slightly_smiling_face:

CCFC | 2024-06-21 13:11:00 UTC | #72

Thanks @Lorimer for that input. I think I understood the reply to my questions and will attempt to reply them explicitly here. Would be nice if @EnzoPlayer0ne or @WaterNeuron could confirm

> 1. What is the link between WTN and nICP?

There is not direct link. nICP holders are the ones providing the funds for the 6 month neuron, WTN SNS investors are the ones providing the funds for the 8 year neuron. 
WTN holders can lock their tokens in the Waterneuron DAO and receive 10% of rewards from the 8 year neuron and 10 % of the rewards from the 6 month neuron. So if the 6 month neuron grows substantially in the future, which is the goal of this project, this inflow can become quite interesting.

> 2. Besides being part of the DAO and being able to vote in the SNS governance, what are the benefits of participating in the SNS?

Basically the same answer as question 1.

> 3. How exactly are nICP linked to the 6 month neuron? If I buy the nICP on a DEX, how does the system know the amount of rewards I’m eligible for when holding nICP?

This one I still don’t understand. Any input from the team?

> 3. How exactly are nICP linked to the 6 month neuron? If I buy the nICP on a DEX, how does the system know the amount of rewards I’m eligible for when holding nICP?

You can think of nICP as the right to some portion of the 6-month neuron. When you unstake nICP at the protocol level, the protocol uses an exchange rate to determine how much ICP you will get in return (in 6 months). The exchange rate is the amount of nICP in existence divided by the total amount of ICP in the 6-month neuron.

-------------------------

CCFC | 2024-06-22 18:24:01 UTC | #74

Thank you. So I understand that nICP are only really staked when they are locked in some canister provided by Waterneuron.

Another question: is there any way that the 8 year neuron can grow in the future? Cause I understand that it’s mainly funded by the SNS fundraising but I don’t see another way how funds can flow into it.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-22 19:07:42 UTC | #76

I believe it grows via the Kiwi, Papaya and Watermelon SNS rounds that are spread out at key intervals based on total value locked. Note that the 6 month neuron also contributes to WTN rewards, and this can keep growing based on users converting to nICP.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2024-06-22 21:48:23 UTC | #77

I'm genuinely impressed by the level of thought and planning that's gone into the Waterneuron project. While it's clear they've drawn inspiration from successful models in other blockchain ecosystems, the team has done an excellent job adapting these concepts to the unique environment of the IC.

I've spent considerable time analyzing WTN's potential impact, and I believe it could be a game-changer for our ecosystem. The way it approaches governance and liquidity issues is particularly intriguing to me. I'm convinced that both the broader IC community and the DFINITY Foundation should take WTN seriously - it has the potential to address some longstanding challenges we've faced.

After weighing the pros and cons, I've made the decision to support this initiative. I'm excited to see how it develops and potentially reshapes our approach to governance and staked ICP liquidity. Of course, I encourage everyone to do their own research, but from my perspective, WTN is a project that deserves our attention and support.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-23 19:55:56 UTC | #80

Only liquid ICP as it needs staking through WaterNeuron in order to mint nICP (if its already staked then it can't be restaked). This is the answer I got when I asked the same question :wink:

Good point. I agree, it would be another game changer if this could be done. @EnzoPlayer0ne, any plans for something like this in the future? This could help gain support from individuals who already have the vast majority of their ICP staked.

-------------------------

Andy_K | 2024-06-24 07:48:48 UTC | #83

Yes if the 8 year gang could participate in the ecosystem it would be a huge boost to adoption.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-24 11:56:38 UTC | #84

I suppose the difficulty would be ensuring that those who have staked their ICP are not relinquished from the long-term commitment they've already made. They'd need to aquire **staked** WTN tokens that are equivalent in terms of long-term commitment. Without this, transerability of neurons would be dangerous and I wouldn't be in favour of it. I suspect this is why WaterNeuron doesn't support this use case (assuming it would even be technically feasible).

-------------------------

ckMood | 2024-06-24 18:47:15 UTC | #85

I’ve been thinking about WaterNeuron and its potential. @Lorimer has certainly got me thinking of the positives that liquid staking could bring to the IC is implemented properly. I still need to do more research but I wonder what increased liquidity would’ve done for ICP had we had this type of infrastructure in place when we hit $20 earlier this year. I’m sure what a lot of people would’ve liked to see is what WaterNeuron is attempting to provide.

-------------------------

WaterNeuron | 2024-06-27 06:19:52 UTC | #89

Exactly, first of all, it's not technically possible. WaterNeuron has been designed to align with the NNS design of non-transferable neurons as transferable neurons could cause harm to the IC.

Allowing people to convert their 8-year neuron to WTN, would be like making neurons transferable which could be dangerous. On the other hand, we would be in favor of allowing 6-month neurons to be converted to nICP.
