I followed article below to install the SDK on my Macbook (OSX Monterey v12.4).
- https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins

```
> dfx --version
dfx 0.12.1
```

But cannot run successfully the `dfx` CLI without prefixing it with `sudo`. 

```
> yarn start
Password:
yarn run v1.22.18
warning package.json: No license field
$ npm run generate

> hello_frontend@0.1.0 generate
> dfx generate hello_backend

Error: Failed to create AgentEnvironment.

```

And I found discussions below.

I solved this problem with `chown` .config/dfx.

```console
> ls -l ~/.config
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  4 root    128 Jan 27 17:47 dfx

> sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.config/dfx
```

FYI `dfx` needs permission to generate identity.
```
> dfx identity new USER_NAME
Please enter a passphrase for your identity: [hidden]
Encryption complete.
