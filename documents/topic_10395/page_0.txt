Here's the tweet: https://twitter.com/lastmjs/status/1484257526845689863

Basically I would like to create the most open, fair, transparent, and community-owned podcast ecosystem ever, and build it on the Internet Computer.

I already have a lot the code done from a previous project (Podcrypt). The code is currently closed-source, but I would like to find an interested person or group of people who want to take this on. I'm willing to help advise and get things going. I think there's a lot of potential here.

Please reach out if you're interested in this.

PodDAO.  I'd imagine this would extrapolate to a broad set of content.

I've now launched the first step to achieving this vision: https://podcrypt.app

This is a podcast player hosted on the IC.
