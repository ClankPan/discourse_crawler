Given IC's full-stack decentralization thesis (over other chains), & recent tornado happenings, I think someone should build a decentralization profiler that analyzes any site for level of decentralization, attack vectors, and stack used.

E.g. a typical Eth site, probably uses AWS EC2, MetaMask client API, centralized DB, smart contracts, some set of centralized APIs etc.

This is both very useful for end user for security reasons (verifying dev's claims), and for developers to understand any site.  For IC, This would also be so much more effective product marketing, than denouncing other chains by tweets ...
