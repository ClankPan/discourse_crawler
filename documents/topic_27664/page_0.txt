The [ic-interface-spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#http-interface) says: "This document does not yet explain how to find the location and port of the Internet Computer."

Is there another document that explains it?

Background of my question is that I want to access the icp:public data that was stored in the wasm of the deployed canister.

The URL of the Internet Computer is omitted in the spec, but arguably well-known (`https://icp0.io`).

Coming back to your specific question of accessing public custom sections in the wasm of a deployed canister: you can use the `dfx canister metadata` command for that, e.g.,
```
dfx canister --network ic metadata qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai 'candid:service'
```
would display the candid interface of the NNS frontend dapp canister.
