It was discussed on the tooling call that it was possible to deploy a zipped wasm and the replica would take care of decompressing it. I was trying to do this with dfx 10 by zipping my wasm and creating a different dfx project that referenced the compressed file.  When I try to install I get 

Error: The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Wasm module of canister a4lpi-tiaaa-aaaaa-aadka-cai is not valid: Wasmtime failed to validate wasm module wasmtime::Module::validate() failed with Bad magic number (at offset 0)"

Is it possible to do this with the local replica? Or is it just a mainnet feature?

Hi @skilesare !

What program do you use to compress the module? The replica currently supports only GZip-compressed modules: 

> * If the `wasm_module` starts with byte sequence `[0x1f, 0x8b, 0x08]` , the system decompresses the contents of `wasm_module` as a gzip stream according to [RFC-1952](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952.html) and then parses the output as a WebAssembly binary.
-- https://smartcontracts.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-install_code

You can use either `gzip` or `pigz` to compress the module.

Ok. I was right clicking compress on Mac and I’m guessing that won’t work. I’ll try gzip which will work better from the command line anyway.

This still isn't working for me.  I get

Error: The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Wasm module of canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai is not valid: Wasmtime failed to validate wasm module wasmtime::Module::validate() failed with Bad magic number (at offset 0)"

config is:
"ledger": {
      "wasm": "./ledger-canister.wasmr-min20220527ledgerfix.wasm",
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "../../modules/ogy_ledger_canister/ledger_dfx_v2.did"
    },

This file was gzipped and I took the .gz off the end(because it didnt' work with that.
