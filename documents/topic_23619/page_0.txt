I would like to begin by saying thank you to everyone that gave us feedback on our earlier post.  We have taken it all on board and it has made us reconsider our original plan.  

We have decided the following:

1.	Change name to DKP
While this is something that we very much would like to do, it is not possible until the Dfinity Foundation adds that functionality. In the meantime, the Dragginz token will be known as SNS-1.

2.	Numeric adaption of token supply 
We have decided to move the decimal place for DKP so that there are a total of 1,000,000,000.000 tokens.  Moving the decimal point does not alter anyoneâ€™s holdings, it just really changes the way the total is displayed.   This should give us enough runway so that when you buy items in game, you will not be dealing with tiny fractions. We plan to do this on 23rd October 2023.  All exchanges SNS-1 can be traded on will be notified ahead of time and trading will temporarily be suspended while this update occurs.


3.	No Inflation
Contrary to our initial thoughts, we have decided not to have inflation at all.  This means that there will be no additional SNS-1 tokens minted as rewards.  The 1 billion tokens (minus the small amount that has already been burnt) are it.

It is now up to us to ensure that the in-game items you can purchase for DKP are interesting enough for us to be able to support development.  Unless people spend DKP in-game, there is no other way for Dragginz to make income.  This could change in the future with merchandising etc, but nobody will want to buy anything if we donâ€™t make a good game!  Even if we do start merchandising, all proceeds from that would be put back into the game.  

4.	No Deflation
As there is no inflation, we have no plans to burn DKP.  Instead the Dragginz Foundation will sell the DKP used to purchase items from the Foundation, and the proceeds will be used to pay for cycles, other running costs and development.

There will however be a slight unavoidable deflationary mechanic.  We will set the transaction fee as low as we can (0.001 DKP).  This transaction fee will be burnt every time a transaction takes place.  We have to do this, it is really an anti-spam fee.

5.	Governance and Voting Incentives
There will be incentives to participate in the governance. These incentives will be some form of rewards embedded in the game mechanism of Dragginz , i.e., not be in form of any direct financial rewards.  The exact form depends on what we can do in the game and may even be subject to a vote itself.  

Some ideas are:
* social status â€“ exclusive titles, hairstyles, clothing, crowns, pets etc.
* access to special ranks which allow you to do things that regular players and non-DKP holders cannot do. (Not game breaking, no pay to win mechanics though)
* we also wish to have a way to recognize how long a person has locked their DKP for in game (opt in of course).  

The governance decisions regarding which we intend to invite the community to provide their opinions on shall include:

* which features are released next
* names and personalities of NPCs
* which Dragginz are designed and released
* which storylines are developed
* ui/ux changes
* etcâ€¦

We know that this will not please everybody but hope that this seems fair and makes sense given what we want to achieve with Dragginz.

What will happen with those DKPs locked for 100+ years. Will this kept locked for 100+ years?

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-09 16:10:41 UTC | #4

We aren't altering the lock ups for people who voluntarily locked up.

If you are referring to the bug some people have with SNS-1 airdrop that occured before it became Dragginz, I believe that is a bug.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-09 16:11:52 UTC | #5

Or we are dealing with a game which could potentially have millions of players who don't want to buy things with 0.00028 DKP...

The goal is to bring mass adoption.

Can we move up the anti spam txn burn to atleast a 1000 dkp. 0.001 won't act as much of an anti spam. Plus it'd be really nice to have some minor burn.

I sincerely hope you will decide otherwise and-or will support any community-proposal that will end this lock-up. People have locked this token with the expectation of rewards. Yes, mine (some part) has 100 years too.

Besides that, you do want Dragginz to become decentralized? So you do want people to lock-up their token? And you donâ€™t want the majority of voting power for yourself?

Then I see no other option then to:

* End the lock-up for everyone;
* Burn or airdrop the tokens you donâ€™t want voting power over;
* Keep the remaining tokens as a fixed % of voting power;
* Have some form of reward in $DKP, but never more then 10K^X.

Personally I would be very grateful for it.

This was part of the reason behind creating this topic  - https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changing-future-max-lock-up-for-sns-1-dkp/23576

Mainly for the UI/UX of not accidentally moving a pixel in the wrong direction and locking your tokens for something other than you intended. 

I do not know if reducing the max lock would retroactively affect everybody who has locked.  We need clarification there @lara @domwoe .

Noticed that 5324.91 $DKP is locked-up longer then 10 years. 

- If I'm right, the team has an allocation of at least 5192.62 $DKP. So, if all tokens would be staked, that's ~ 52% voting power? Does the team want to keep majority of voting power?
- The community holds 132 $DKP in a 10+ - *up to 888* - year neuron.

Isn't it possible to move, lets say 3124.91 $DKP, from the teams 'allocation' into the voting reward treasury?
The team would keep 20% voting power (2000 $DKP). Team and future development could be payed out of their rewards (if they want to).

Stakers from community can get rewarded. No inflation.

(Btw, apprecriate your efforts @Thyassa to do something about these 100-888 years neuron! :) )

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-09 18:55:09 UTC | #24

We want to keep the 52% staked so that we have creative control and can never suffer the fate of our earlier experiences with games.  Through a variety of means commercialism crept in and destroyed the essence of what we were trying to create.  We want to ensure that Dragginz as a company can never be sold, bought out, smothered with real world advertising etc.  

The votes about what gets developed next and added etc we do not wish to take part in.  The only reason we were considering voting before was that we wanted to not be diluted to the point we had under 51%.

Apologies if that doesn't make financial sense, but this really is a passion project here.  We want to make a game that is simply great fun to play and the community helps to shape.  Not min/max financial rewards.

Just make sure rises in price donâ€™t wreck your game, most people were priced out of Axie Infinity because they couldnâ€™t afford to buy the initial characters. The $ cost was over $300 when I looked in the last bull run.

Sawyer | 2023-10-10 06:12:33 UTC | #29

That's the thing, you don't need to pay to play the game. All the paid items are non-game breaking. Rather people might earn stuff if they play or contribute.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-10 07:46:25 UTC | #30

There is no drop or alteration of lock/unlock status.  

This will just change how the amount of SNS-1 is displayed.  It will still be called SNS-1 until we have the ability to rename it.

All we are doing is moving the decimal place.  You will still own the same % of SNS-1, just the number will have more zeros after it. 

Separately I have asked a question to the Dfinity team about reducing the max lock time.  I am awaiting an answer to hear if that will affect all locked neurons, or just people locking going forward.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-10 07:48:30 UTC | #31

@borovan has changed the fee amount back to what it was originally.  Hopefully this will provide a temporary fix until we work out why the error happened.

-------------------------

Apollon | 2023-10-10 14:43:06 UTC | #32

DFINITY banned @Artemi5 so I'm here to answer this



Overall Dragginz seems very bullish even though like every other app on IC, DFINITY's dependencies create obstacles to its development.


Dragginz should consider in game currency - which cannot be traded except for exchanging to DKP(selling accounts/farming/botting/blackmarket will be hectic to handle)

**For example:** Eve Online has a very interesting economy with around 300,000 or more players participating directly. They have 2 currencies. One could be earned in game (comparable to mining) other via purchasing from real money.

Notable for its complex and player-driven economy, it's often cited as one of the most intricate digital economies in the gaming world. The economic system in "Eve Online" shares some similarities with real-world economies, and itâ€™s often influenced by the activities and interactions of its player base.

### Key Aspects of the "Eve Online" Economy and Currencies:

#### 1. **ISK (Interstellar Kredits):**

* **Primary Currency**: ISK is the principal currency used for a variety of transactions within the game.
* **Acquisition**: Players can acquire ISK through various activities, such as asteroid mining, trading, and bounty hunting.
* **Use**: Itâ€™s used for purchasing in-game items from game store, building ships(manufacturing costs), and other services.

#### 2. **PLEX (Pilotâ€™s License Extension):**

* **Premium Currency**: PLEX can be purchased with real-world money and is often used to buy premium items and services.
* **ISK Conversion**: PLEX can be traded for ISK in the in-game market, ***providing a link between the in-game economy and real-world currency.***
* **Subscription Payments**: Players can also use PLEX to pay for their game subscription, linking in-game activities with access to the game itself.





***This is a very new realm and I do hope you know the implications of economy in Open World MMO RPG***


Good decisions with increasing token supply, at least you are moving ahead.

10,000 tokens creates FOMO and excessive Speculation by "altcoin gem enthusiasts"

Team should create appropriate infra(guilds + treasuries) for DAO voting and discussions in game -  I guess you are.


DKP Foundation as middleman for overseeing sustenance is a bit of "trustmebro"

IMO inflation and deflation are equally important for open world economies. 

We are just waiting for the game to release so that we can try it out and play it. We just hope dragginz won't sacrifice gameplay and decentralization for cash grabs like few of the IC projects with centralized infrastructure. There's a good reason for smart contracts being immutable on other chains.

This does not mean we support 51% on any SNS DAO. But something is better than nothing.

We also expect Dragginz to tons of value in real world once it takes off. ICP is rocket fuel for web3 gaming so its potential must be utilized with positive sum games.


And Dragginz team is creating value on IC with assets and codes, so it will receive the support of users and contributors who believe in it :+1:

-------------------------

Sawyer | 2023-10-10 16:22:45 UTC | #33

Team, does the dragginz team have a way to manage the dkp economy?

Say people buy stuff with dkp and the team acquires a lot of dkp. How is the team planning to switch it to icp.

Would it be done by selling dkp on the open market.

I would suggest if possible team could setup an internal exchange that helps people swap usd/icp for dkp. Then sell that ICP for cycles.

-------------------------

Zep | 2023-10-10 16:34:16 UTC | #34

I strongly believe the voluntarily locked tokens should be released. My intention, like many others, was to have a significant voice in the SNS-1 DAO, showcasing our long-term commitment and willingness to contribute. However, with the DAO's direction changing post the 51% takeover, it's only just to reconsider the locked positions, especially for those who locked before this event, as we demonstrated pure intentions.

Perhaps, as a gesture of goodwill, the project can offer the opportunity to re-lock tokens. Technically, the newly minted tokens are distinct from the original ones, and they shouldn't automatically inherit the same restrictions.

In short: Many of us committed to the original cypherpunk DAO vision, but it's evolved into a game now. Allowing us the choice to unlock and relock seems only fair. Though we represent a small percentage, our commitment speaks to the heart of the DAO's original decentralization ideals.

Thyassa | 2023-10-11 12:41:09 UTC | #37

New maximum dissolve delay is 8 years. 

This means that anyone who has locked for under 8 years, has the option of locking up to a maximum of eight years. It does not change any neurons locked for a greater period than that.

If you locked for longer than 8 years and no longer wish to be locked for that long, the only option available to you is to start dissolving and try to live a long healthy life.

As for the 600 or so neuron holders happily locked for 100 years or more, I guess we will have to figure some way to display that tremendous faith in the game somehow!

Apologies for the changes, but this is really new territory for everyone here.

@borovan have you given a thought on the payment flow for users that want to buy in game items with dkp. Would they have to go the way of cex > icp > dkp?

Feel like that might be a little too much for web2 guys. Could there be a direct payment gateway that let's users add usd to dkp in game?

Urgent Update:  Decimal Day is cancelled!

Unfortunately it is a query call and not an update, we can only query the decimals not change them.  This is our fault, we thought it was possible. 

This means 23rd October will pass by as normal, with no change to SNS-1.

We cannot do anything to change the number of SNS-1 tokens without the help of the SNS team.  @lara @domwoe 

Until we come up with a solution together, SNS-1 will remain exactly as it is currently.

I saw a discussion on Twitter. It is said that the IC-X DAO treasury (150,000ICP) created under the SNS DAO was emptied through a proposal put to the vote. Is the SNS dao representative aware of this issue? Is there such a thing. Also, can any DAO treasury be emptied by voting? I'm curious about the explanations on this subject

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-10-16 21:59:13 UTC | #48

Yeah the dragginz team showed that if you control 51% then you have control of the community fund. But instead of selling it they locked it for 888 years so they are guaranteed control of the DAO. ICX saw this same opportunity but did it to rug. I wonder how much they had to invest to get that $500k

For an sns to be able to set the ledger parameters: transfer_fee, token_symbol, token_decimals, etc, the sns-governance canister needs a new proposal action type that can upgrade the ledger with the new parameters. The ledger already supports upgrading most parameters through the post_upgrade arg on the ledger, so the sns-governance can use that to set the parameters. Here is the code: https://github.com/levifeldman/ic/pull/1/files.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-10-19 13:55:42 UTC | #51

I hope increasing decimals is a one-off thing we can do for DKP, but then it shouldn't be done ever again. The amount of patching(upgrades) it will require only makes sense now when there aren't that many things using these tokens. At some point, it will be impossible. 
- SNS patch like what @levi has made
- each dex:
    - patch canister memory to increase balances or order amounts
    - patch its trade history and chart data
- ledger:
   - patch user balances, cancel approvals
   - patch transaction history changing transaction values
- patch all stats sites, browsers & data analytics, and whatever memory they have collected
- patch other unknown DeFi contracts & offline trading scripts (arbitrage bots)

-------------------------

blush | 2023-10-19 15:26:59 UTC | #52

I donâ€™t quite agree with this improvement. This is DKP applying for privileges. If this precedent is set, it will have a bad impact. Please refer to other methods to remedy it. @plsak

[/quote]

Thinking if already has been tested what are (all) possible consequences for holders of such token (liquid/staked/in LP/...) which went though the `post_upgrade` update process, eventually if such testing can be conducted (real-life scenario rather than dry-run) before it will be applied to SNS1 - considering the SNS1 release troubles and current growth I believe that the community is very sensitive in this matter.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-10-19 17:49:11 UTC | #55

Oh it would only be something we do once. I am not even sure that changing the decimals would update on exchanges unless each exchange manually did something either.  

It turns out this is a bigger headache than we originally thought.  There are a couple of options we can do to get the same outcome.  We are just waiting to hear from SNS team if we can take snapshots of all holders at a certain time or not to decide which way option to go ahead with.  

We aim to be as transparent as possible and aren't trying to screw anybody over here.

As soon as we know either way, we will let everyone know.  

Sorry...

Yeah, I meant that 'ManageLedgerParameters' can't be something that stays in the SNS long-term available for all SNSes. It's like a self-destruct button. I doubt anyone will mind patching a few things for Dragginz, since it's pretty much 80+% of IC DeFI volume (post SNS launch) so far.

There is no need for most of that. 
The ledger stores token amounts as token-quantums. There is no notion of decimals in the ledger canisters' bookkeeping. The dexs' frontends need updating and if the dexs have implementations of calculations that depend on the `decimals` number then those need updating too.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-10-20 14:45:51 UTC | #60

Yes, some of that won't be needed. I got confused because the previous post mentioned an increase in tokens, not just decimal movement. But still, some of that will be needed.
ICPSwap getPool function result:
![image|404x500, 75%](upload://rPaIP9OGC1slcZzJopIGFkj8PYy.png)

Notice all of these floats. Makes you wonder if all of them are being calculated on the fly or if some of them are being stored. When these get calculated, do contracts fetch fresh 'decimals' from the ledger, or is it cached? 
Unless everyone stores prices/rates as two Nats and not one Float, things will need fixing.
A quick search of 'Float' in ICDex shows few hits
![image|690x203](upload://ku6eiZt8pKMHh9xcgb0Ot8vY0ve.png)
![image|690x78](upload://1nJDeRJ3L8gbqF8oQEUIBfjwFa8.png)

Actually, there is a better rule of thumb. If a contract uses `decimals` to calculate something and stores it in memory, or uses another canister that provides such value, that will be something that will cause problems.

We have decided to move the decimal place for DKP so that there are a total of 1,000,000,000.000 tokens. Moving the decimal point does not alter anyoneâ€™s holdings, it just really changes the way the total is displayed. This should give us enough runway so that when you buy items in game, you will not be dealing with tiny fractions.

**Many facts indicate** that not increasing the supply of SNS1 can maintain the value,price, scarcity and rareness of SNS1, which is quite important for token economics. **After increase the Total Supply(or even Total Supply * N), will have a negative impact on coin price, project, community, and more.The is not FUD!**
 **We need to solve the problem without increasing the total supply of SNS1(to maintain the valueï¼Œprice, scarcity and rareness of SNS1),Although the frontend and backend requires some update and annotation!**,

Jabberwocky | 2023-10-20 14:37:07 UTC | #62

You ever heard of a stock split? That's exactly what's going to happen. Nothing will change, you will own the same exact percentage of DKP compared to the total supply and the market cap will be the same. This needs to happen for the in-game functionality of the token. Nobody would be gettinf screwed here it would all be a visual change and the transaction fees will be lower in order to trade these smaller quantities

This isn't an increase in supply this is a decimal change. I suggest you do more research next time before posting your opinion

To avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities and so on, I think the proposal fromm @levi is **a better way and explanation to solve one of the problems in SNS1**

**We should treat this proposal positively, this kind of code contribution from the community is very important(and in the future when facing with increasingly complex situations,collaborations and more, it will become more and more important),** we need to learn, try to reduce the dependence on DFINITY( This is what DFINITY should expect to some extent)ï¼Œ**so I expect that this proposal will be one of the good start or demonstration of the community contributing code and more**


 **which is not only good for decentralization, but also good for long-term sustainable application, development, innovation, and more!**

There may be some difficulties in adopting this proposal, and **I hope to pass the proposal after a series of collaborations, preparations, improvements, and more!**

Thanks for the explanation @levi @infinite
I'm mentioning below comment which summarizes my worries - for example I can image FE (DEX, Wallet,...) which doesn't get the parameters dynamically, has separated variables (or hardcoded value) for `icrc1_decimals` per operation, updates it for reads/displaying and leaves old values for writes/sending - causing discrepancy in SNS1 token-quantums which would be processed.

I mean I'm supportive for any solution which will be chosen, just would like to express need for throughout (ecosystem-wide) testing in case of change to current SNS1 parameters/tokenomics :pray:

@infu My above comment made an assumption about the dexs' implementations. My mistake. I have no knowledge of the dexs' implementations or how they calculate their values. Thanks for double checking my comment. I updated my comment above removing assumptions about the dexs' implementations. 

[quote="levi, post:59, topic:23619"]
The ledger stores token amounts as token-quantums. There is no notion of decimals in the ledger canistersâ€™ bookkeeping. The dexsâ€™ frontends need updating and if the dexs have implementations of calculations that depend on the `decimals` number then those need updating too.

Update on the `ManageLedgerParameters` proposal: 

[quote="levi, post:12, topic:23886"]
I am now updating this proposal to only contain the settings `transfer_fee` and `set_fee_collector`, We will leave the other parameters for a different day.

[quote="levi, post:19, topic:23886"]
We are taking one step at a time and making sure we move with caution and care. This proposal now creates the ability for an sns to only change one ledger parameter (relevant for this conversation): `transfer_fee`.

Lets focus now on making sure that a change in a snsâ€™s **ledger-transfer-fee** works smooth with every platform.
