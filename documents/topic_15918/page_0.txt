Hey i am completly new to setting up http request, opening gateways and such. i have been reading docs . ive come far but im stuck. 
i am currently trying to install a service worker. but theres a requirement for node and npm. im programing in wsl2 and for some reason nvm could not recognise node directory. now the problem is npm i cant seem to be to upgrade it to 8.5. I tried multiple things i googled but i cant pass 8.11.0. ihavent found source that v8.5.0 is out yet
does any one know how i can upgrade npm. 
even better would be a stupidly simple guide for setting up a custom domain.
these are my refrenses til now the all similar and im stuck on all of em at the same place;

if it helps the dapp is done and already running live

there are two different dapps that work together, one is a wallet and token contract the other is the main website
