Hey guys, I created a type

```
   public type User={
         name:Text;
         age:Nat;
         hobbies:[Text];
   };
```

Then I want to return User into a json format data in the Response of **http_request**.

```
         return {
             body = Text.encodeUtf8(USERJSON);
             headers = [("Content-Type","application/json;charset=utf-8")];
             status_code = 200;
         };
```

If I pass in the data directly, it is successful
`body=Text.encodeUtf8("{name:'tom',age:11}");`

So I need to construct this Text type data, the stupid way is to use Text.concat to splice into a paragraph of text.

I want to ask
1. Is there any way to convert type data into Text or Blob?
2. Is there any better way to splice a long text with parameters?

You can use `debug_show` to get a `Text` rendering of most values. But there is no JSON library for Motoko, let alone a _generic_ conversion library. So you need to put your JSON together manually.
