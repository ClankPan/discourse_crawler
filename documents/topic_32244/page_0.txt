Forget about getting meme coins and other sh*t coins listed on decentralized exchanges (DEX).  What we need are dexes being able to list securities.  Imagine being able to buy Tesla stocks or maybe even Nvidia on ICPswap or Helix!   This has been talked about several times by Dominic, and I noticed that it's now mentioned on ICP's website, here ( [Secure, seamless and, privacy-preserving digital identity | Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity):

> Proof of Humanity credentials are going live on the Internet Computer and will enable new use cases **such as security tokens subject to financial regulations**.

 When this happens, I think it will drive demand and bring in a lot of people to ICP.  


**The obvious question is when will this happen?**

I'm waiting on that second example for KYC/security tokens!
