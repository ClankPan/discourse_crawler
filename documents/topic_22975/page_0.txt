Could we add a file system liked abstract to the stable-structure crate's memory trait?

I want to write and read serveral files in bytes in canister. I want to use stable-structure' memory manager to manage my canister stable memory. However, implementing such a file system algorithm above the `Memory` trait seems hard to me and error prone. I want to know what is better way to do this.
