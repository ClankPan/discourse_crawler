I checked my first voter rewards today and something seems very off, has to be a glitch or something...

According to this [article](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8) on DFINITY's Medium:

![image|690x465](upload://sxk5LBZaKuDxPwADczmus6KxUHs.png)

Checking against my voting power:

**The max dissolve-delay bonus should be 100%**
- **check**, my vote power for an 8-year dissolve delay neuron with 1 staked ICP is right at **2** (plus some dust)

**The max-age bonus should be ~25% when maxed out at 4 years** 
- **check**, the dust...

Here's where it gets wonky:

![185291484_581910239418738_5141328031491609992_n|465x500](upload://zGBFJoSZxREQsZykbKyTtfvD8Jx.jpeg)

Checking this vote on the NNS canister upgrade that I participated in, what appears to be the tally [by voting power] seems very off as there appear to be ~32 **Quadrillion** weighted votes. I thought to myself, '*ehh must be a glitch or I'm misunderstanding something...*'

*Then I went to the page for that Neuron to see what the maturity was for the first day of voting:*

![185426977_599435224782742_8888643014575536209_n|320x500](upload://jQkUtGJAfqlBkTJjixhgk1KihbU.jpeg)

**... 0.0008017%.**

For those that are unfamiliar, that percentage equates (roughly) to how much of your staked amount you can spawn in a new neuron that comes preset with a 1-day dissolve timer.

*as explained on [medium](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8) (see screenshot below):* 
![Screenshot 2021-05-16 9.27.28 PM|690x422](upload://uvoZjpPEqiIGr9iBevex3pig5YH.png)

... 0.0008017% is the equivalent of dust for rewards; **$0.00** when rounded, **$0.00240510000000** to be exact [assuming a $300 ICP] for the first day of rewards on my 1-ICP staked neuron with a dissolve delay of 8 years.

This leads me to question further if what appears to be **~32 quadrillion** total voter-power is actually the case.

If this number is in fact the total voting power:
- that would put the average ratio of vote-power-to-ICP at around 92 Million to 1 with mine and other retail investors after genesis being around 2 to 1, plus dust, (for a neuron staked with 1 ICP after genesis with a maxed-out dissolve delay bonus and negligible age bonus)
- retail investors after genesis would receive **millions** to 1  less of the ~10% of total coin supply voter reward pool this year than those who received pre-aged neurons at genesis.
- assuming a $300 ICP and not accounting for further changes in the percentage of ICP that is staked, by my calculations that would be around 88 cents for the 1st year staking reward.

According to that medium article from last week, the age reward is **supposed** to be capped at 25% and achieved at 4 years, which would be reasonable.

**Spreadsheet where I worked some out rough estimates (assuming a $300-priced ICP):**

Hopefully, I am misunderstanding something in how things are being displayed or this is some kind of glitch... I couldn't imagine this being intended.

Could you point me to a link where I can see this page for my neurons?

Chris | 2021-05-17 14:43:47 UTC | #4

nns.ic0.app → neuron tab → click on the neuron you would like to view.

Displays better on a full size device, not as responsive to mobile screens as it should be.

Thanks. My problem is, I have my key for my neurons on an air-gapped device. On this site (nns.ic0.app) I can only login with a new identity. How can I see my neurons in a view-only mode? No private keys should be necessary for this.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 14:51:43 UTC | #7

Only thing I am aware of that may be of help is this [link](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html).

I only skimmed it.

-------------------------

ICPNorway | 2021-05-17 14:52:23 UTC | #8

Very strange indeed! Did you vote for all proposals that particicular day or just the one?

-------------------------

criptoslav | 2021-05-17 15:02:46 UTC | #9

Fun fact I have 2,665 ICP stacked with 5,33384041 voting power, but I also got "Maturity 0,00080161%", ...

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 15:05:29 UTC | #10

I have follow [Internet Computer Association] set on all topics but 1 from the day I created the Neuron.

and [Internet Computer Foundation] on 1.

Going to set everything to follow both just to be sure because if I understand correctly, if they don't vote together, the NNS should cast a vote against on my behalf.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 15:14:52 UTC | #11

Makes sense because the maturity is [roughly] equivalent to how much of your particular stake you should be able to spawn in a neuron... so you've earned .00080161% thus far. 

**$0.00 rounded at current price.**

You must have set your dissolve delay on that neuron set to 8 years too looking at your numbers.

I'm wondering how much of a boost in neuron maturity seed / early investors are currently getting per day...

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 15:15:28 UTC | #12

Who do you have your neuron set to follow?

-------------------------

criptoslav | 2021-05-17 15:21:47 UTC | #13

8 years dissolve delay and I didn't started "unlock", I set that neuron to follow both Dfinity and Internet Computer Foundation on all topics

-------------------------

criptoslav | 2021-05-17 15:19:28 UTC | #14

I see that I can "Spawn Neuron" but not sure what that do? :)

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 15:45:46 UTC | #15

If this isn't some kind of implementation bug, your current voting rewards come out to [roughly] .0021 ICP. If you were to press that spawn button that should be [roughly] what would be in the spawned neuron with a 1 day dissolve-delay. The article mentioned there was a bit of randomness to it and that the maturity rate as a percentage of your stake is what you should 'expect' to receive because how the maturity rate can change based off when it's calculated or something.

Distribution of voting rewards is supposed to be distributed daily, at a rate of ~10% of Genesis supply (annually) for the first year and taper off to 5% following this parabola that is a quadratic function of time, meaning it's a smooth curve just as displayed when calculated daily:

![image|480x500](upload://wPOAkxWW7LczSLJY37l0YnVttnB.jpeg)

-------------------------

CJentzsch | 2021-05-17 15:51:48 UTC | #16

I have pre-aged neurons, and my voting power as derived by this method: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/seed-donations.html#_get_you_neuron_identifiers

is a factor of 100M higher than the ICP hold in the neuron. I wonder if this is just a matter of the unit.
What is the smallest subunit of one ICP?

If you, @Chris , could get the voting_power of your 1 ICP Neuron the same way, we could compare. Because I don't know whether your UX is changing the units.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 16:15:17 UTC | #17

Hoping that's the case, maybe % was added to the multiplier that is achieve the percent so the maturity should be slid 2 decimal points over? 

![image|690x152](upload://htEE0wUh56oFQdGr2nPE869L7z1.png)

(I deleted the percent symbol in the selected cell of the spreadsheet for this calculation)

This makes a lot more sense in terms of a [very roughly estimated] yearly API than what is currently displayed:

.0008 **Percent** ... I'm thinking the percent symbol shouldn't be there on the UI.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 16:31:39 UTC | #18

So maybe this? ...

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 16:49:11 UTC | #19

I think you're right on the way the votes are displayed, they probably did the calculation based off of how ICP is stored on the ledger (see section 2 of this screenshot) from the [medium article](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8):

![image|671x500](upload://kDgwGiAOXxWG9cNLQfJ3a8tAoH3.png)

**(one hundredth of a millionth of an ICP)**

I would suggest changing that ASAP on the front end [using javascript] to display in the same unit that users voting power is displayed in.

Also, if that percent symbol isn't supposed to be there on the maturity screen it needs to be removed until the calculation displayed is correct with it.

-------------------------

ICPNorway | 2021-05-17 17:19:33 UTC | #20

So what you are saying is that 32 mill of voting power voted in favor of the example provided, where your voting power was 2?

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-17 18:39:10 UTC | #21

2 things, the voting power looks to be displayed in the same unit that it is stored on the ledger **(one hundredth of a millionth of an ICP)** which comes out to a total of ~32 quadrillion.

I believe the total voting power of the proposal I screenshot comes out to ~320 Million in whole-ICP units, **which looks good if so!**

Also, I believe there may be an error in how maturity is displayed on the UI... I don't believe the % symbol belongs as it makes **a lot more sense** without it (if the decimal is slid over 2 places)

*This screenshot highlights what I would assume to be correct in green:*
![image|690x159](upload://8kzcRk93eRPRHC7eXjJBvvbE0v1.png)

...but the suspected UI error has yet to be verified.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-18 20:31:14 UTC | #22

Update: 

![image|358x500](upload://l4piftqIhzGrMn8xETfX1wADl9D.png)

The daily voter reward for today has hit my neuron as maturity, and as expected, the maturity has doubled... should around .0008 every day added on my 8 year dissolve delay neuron (until a significant amount of people either fall below the 6-month dissolve timer required to vote, stake more ICP into neurons, or turn the dissolve timer on resetting their neuron age-rewards back to zero)

Still uncertain if it is .0008% or .0008 of 1 that is added (with 1 of 1 representing 100% maturity), I am assuming that whats displayed on the UI is **wrong**, but this has yet to be confirmed.

0.0016% is **way different** than 0.0016 of 1.

... one is pretty good and reasonably equitable no matter what point someone begins staking, the other would be a joke (literal $0.00 daily return [when rounded] and less than a dollar for the year at the current price for an 8-year dissolve delay neuron created post-genesis with a 1 ICP stake.

I'm pretty certain the percentage symbol displayed makes it wrong by 2 decimal places, I just want confirmation before staking any more... In the meantime I have asked my friends and followers to be careful staking until it is known for sure which is which while doing my best to avoid unnecessary FUD.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-18 07:51:11 UTC | #23

I’ve been panicking over this very same topic.  My maturity for the last 2 days are nearly identical to yours.  I staked with 8 year dissolve delay without starting the dissolve.  At first I was super excited about potential for 29% annualized staking/voting rewards, but then I realized that the NNS app shows that the maturity is reported with percent units.  If this is true, then the staking returns would be a dismal at 0.29% annualized staking/voting rewards (0.0008% * 365).  This would definitely not be worth participating in staking.  I submitted a support ticket earlier tonight in hopes of getting clarification from dfinity.  If this really is the issue, then they either need to convert the reported maturity value into percent and leave the percent units on the display or they need to leave the number in a unitless ratio and remove the percent unit.  I don’t care how it is displayed as long as it is correct.  It does not seem likely to be correct at this time.  BTW, thank you for spending so much time and effort to research and document this issue.

criptoslav | 2021-05-18 12:57:18 UTC | #24

I tried to "Spawn Neuron" few times, but everytime nnc web app crashed, I am using Safari/iPhone 12, most of the time when I am on single neuron page, app freezes, as soon as voting history is loaded. I simple can not understand that this simple frontend app is faulty in so many ways.

I understand that ic/network needs more polishing but simple app with 4 tabs and few functions to be this  faulty that is something that I can not understand.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-18 14:25:09 UTC | #25

I just tried to spawn one as well.

*From the debug console:*
![image|690x28](upload://2RCLJa0a0Z8Iy1Q4yGivsDBTUK6.png)

"... **There isn't enough maturity to spawn a new neuron**..."
 
The spawn-neuron button shouldn't be enabled on the front end yet.

(Full stack developer here willing to help, pretty sure I can fix the front end issues)

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-18 16:20:06 UTC | #26

I tried to spawn as well and it hung up as you describe.  I suspect I haven’t reached the threshold maturity to spawn yet, but I also don’t know what threshold maturity to expect.  There definitely seems to be a surprisingly high number of faulty features with the NNS app, but dfinity does seem to be working through them.  I agree with Chris’ comment that the spawn neuron button probably shouldn’t be active until the threshold maturity has been reached.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-18 16:41:10 UTC | #27

Yes, most definitely a front end bug on allowing the spawn button to be pressed because the back end is responding with a sane response; it wouldn't make much sense to allow a neuron to be spawned with the parent having only 2 days of maturity.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-19 02:03:40 UTC | #28

I think it's about time for some kind of reply here, ...

I'm 99.9% sure that the percent symbol displayed by Neuron 'maturity' on the nns.ic0.app UI doesn't belong or the decimal point needs to be slid over two places to the left.

Please confirm if this is correct or let me know if my assumption is wrong.

*Highlighted the easy to follow parts with examples that cannot be misunderstood:*

------

The reward distribution amongst voters is supposed to be calculated daily based on a rate that would be right at 10% for the first year, yet the maturity shows gains closer to 0.10% for the first year...

I can report that my neuron maturity now reads as expected.  Last night it read 0.0024052% and this morning it reads 0.2405166%.  It appears they have updated the NNS app to show this maturity at a level that makes more sense by moving the decimal place 2 positions to the right and keeping the maturity in percent units.  The “spawn neuron” button is also greyed out now, so I cannot initiation that action.  That makes sense since my neuron hasn’t reached the maturity threshold (I still don’t know the threshold value).

So it appears that the current annualized returns on ICP staked for 8 years is approx 29% (my neuron has shown maturity growth for 3 days at this time).  This is fantastic.

-------------------------

Gabriel | 2021-05-19 12:49:43 UTC | #30

@Ori posted this in telegram

> The threshold to spawn is simply the amount of ICP you’d need to create a neuron normally (which is currently around 1 ICP but the NNS can change this). If you have enough maturity to generate this many ICP, then you can spawn.

A bit high imo as most people will stake a few ICP but maybe this will change in time.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-19 13:02:53 UTC | #31

That makes sense.  Thanks for the insight.

-------------------------

kearmijo | 2021-05-24 03:46:32 UTC | #32

I might be a little confused about the staking rewards. Is the return at 10% of staked icp over the course of a year? If you stake for the maximum 8 year period does that double to 20% return per year? I understand that it decreases percentage wise over the 8 year period to 5% but I’m trying to figure out how daily rewards are calculated. Say I stake 100 icp for 8 years. That then counts towards 200 voting points. Is my first year gains expected to be 20 new icp?
Thanks for any feedback 
Kenny

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-24 04:19:29 UTC | #33

You seem to have the voting power correct based on the 8 year example.  There's also a neuron age component that adds to voting power as well.  The actual returns are a bit difficult to explain.  There is a planned allocation of rewards that will be divided among people with staked ICP who participate in voting.  The amount of the reward depends on several factors, but there is a known amount that is awarded and it is divided among everyone with voting power.  Dfinity has published a good description of the rewards calculation at the end of the linked article in Medium.  It's probably best to read that to learn more since it is published by dfinity.

Thank you I appreciate the response. I will read through it and hopefully get a better understanding of the allocation.

Chris | 2021-05-24 06:09:08 UTC | #35

See my last comment and pay particular attention to the real-world examples at the end of each section... be sure and actually do the math for those examples in your head to check behind them and you'll get it.

To answer your question about the 10%, it splits up a reward pool that is around 10 percent (for an entire year) on a daily basis to voters depending on how many proposals they participated in for the day. 

It's important to note that it's not a steady 10% forever or even any more to be exact as it tapers off to 5% gradually, and the method for its calculation on a daily basis makes a smooth curve, you can see the representation of that curve in the graph I posted. You don't have to understand the complicated looking formula of how it creates that curve, just that the total reward pool gradually decreases every day until it gets to the equivalent of what would be 5% per year at which point it goes flat... also this may be changed by governance proposals if it isn't enough to get to the target percent of ICP being staked where they want it.

and again, the other parts to the equation to determine the voting power of your neuron is posted just above, which also directly determines the ratio of the rewards to be added to your neuron as 'maturity'

-------------------------

kearmijo | 2021-05-24 22:57:33 UTC | #36

Thank you for the reply, I think I am starting to understand how the rewards work.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-25 03:59:17 UTC | #37

No prob, let me know if anything is still fuzzy.

-------------------------

kearmijo | 2021-05-25 15:01:10 UTC | #38

I hope I’m not getting too far off topic, I’m pretty new to the crypto space. I am curious about the circulating supply. It appears to be about 26% currently and from reading the articles you guys posted the goal is 10%. They are going to incentivize people to lock up more icp by increasing rewards in order to achieve the 10%? If I’m understanding this correctly the rewards should increase until this is achieved. This also should boost the price as a result of lower circulating supply.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-25 20:50:11 UTC | #39

Key point is that's how they came to and justified the numbers for the reward pool and as far as I know the variables in addition to nearly everything else about the protocol is adjustable through governance proposals.

It would make sense that going forward decisions will be made that are conducive to the projects long term success. 

To guess what will happen is a bit speculative for this forum but I'm pretty certain most people who are staked and voting would like the value of their holdings to go up, especially being that if they're currently voting the earliest they can cash out is 6 months in the future... so in my mind the best way for voters to do that is to make decisions that are good for the long term health of the project.

-------------------------

kearmijo | 2021-05-28 03:39:53 UTC | #40

I am also having trouble removing icp tokens out of the dfinity nns. I had no problem sending them from coinbase to nns but there does not appear to be a send or execute button when transferring tokens back out. Has anyone else had this issue?
