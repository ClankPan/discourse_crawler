Hi, Dfinity Forum.

Having lost my faucet cycles, I am now trying to follow https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-wallet and stumbling over the very basic steps - with dfx 0.17.0.
Just look at these 2 commands issued after **dfx start --clean --background** one immediately after the other:
```
[andre@blackview bmos-ic.react]$ dfx wallet controllers
Creating a wallet canister on the local network.
The wallet canister on the "local" network for user "devops" is "by6od-j4aaa-aaaaa-qaadq-cai"
hu7kx-vlkfq-bet4b-mazsd-ctysh-btwfs-2fmtg-fey44-s3neu-hbn5s-5qe
[andre@blackview bmos-ic.react]$ dfx wallet controllers
Error: Failed to call query function 'get_controllers' on wallet.
Caused by: Failed to call query function 'get_controllers' on wallet.
  Failed to construct wallet canister caller: Certificate verification failed.
```

So why does **dfx wallet controllers** not "List the wallet's controllers" as it is supposed to do?

Looks like nobody ever tried to use the command twice in a row... I'll file a bug (note to self: [ticket](https://dfinity.atlassian.net/browse/SDKTG-317)). 

Side note: you're working on the local network. There you probably never really want to work with wallets manually since they get created automatically in the background. What exactly are you trying to accomplish?

Hi, Severin. 
And thanks a lot for your quick reply.

Trying to follow the instructions of [mainnet deployment](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/mainnet) and holding some ICPs in the NNS dApp, I read that I will need a cycles wallet on the mainnet with some cycles in it. So I go to **Creating a cycles wallet on the mainnet** under [using a cycles wallet](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-wallet) and recognize that it won't work because I cannot imagine that *dfx ledger --network ic* will allow me any transfers, for my local dev env knows nothing of my Internet Identity I use for the NNS dApp.

So I just try to understand how dfx wallet is supposed to work. And see that while I can do dfx wallet ballance, dfx wallet addresses fails.
``` 
$ dfx wallet balance
100.000 TC (trillion cycles).
[andre@blackview bmos-ic.react]$ dfx wallet addresses
Error: Failed to call query function 'list_addresses' on wallet.
Caused by: Failed to call query function 'list_addresses' on wallet.
  Failed to construct wallet canister caller: Certificate verification failed.
```
dfx wallet name fails, too.
So tired of things that just won't work as advertised.
Even dfx ledger transfer --help still gives the wrong usage *Usage: dfx ledger transfer [OPTIONS] --memo <MEMO> <TO>*. Did anyone actually TRIED to put the \<TO\> at the end?!

@Jessie I think it would be better to drop the section on local cycles wallets. It doesn't really make sense to have that.

@AndreLeifert I suggest you skip the local part since on local cycles wallets are handled transparently and focus on the mainnet parts

Thanks for your suggestion, Severin.

Could you perhaps point me to a resource describing the process of deploying a canister / a dApp to mainnet? I have already pointed out why respective articles on internetcomputer.org don't work for me. Only for those few lucky ones who are able to transfer ICPs by using an identity stored on their computer.
