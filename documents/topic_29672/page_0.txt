i tried to shrink the region page to 0 but it's still the same as before.

or this is impossible for now? if so, then i should overwrite the region starting from position 0, yes?

Can you remove all references to the Region so that it gets garbage collected?

See: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motoko-stable-regions/19182/12

No, you cannot shrink a region, just as you cannot shrink raw stable memory.

Unfortunately, garbage collection of regions, though planned for, is not yet implemented.

### What is a "region"?[â€‹](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/2023/09/13/news-and-updates/update#what-is-a-region)

A `Region` is a new Motoko abstract data type that uses an API which exposes low-level canister stable memory. `Region`s are unique since they use distinct portions of stable memory that never interfere with one another. New `Region`s can be created dynamically, *and any old regions that are marked for garbage collection will be removed and reused for new `Region`s afterwards*.



The bit in italics is inaccurate. I'm not sure how that got out but it is a misunderstanding.
