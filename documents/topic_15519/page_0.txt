Hello everyone, 

I have a serious issue with my account, having registered an account last year, my anchor ID and seed phrase securely saved.

I had an issue with the mobile which I had to format my phone to factory settings, upon trying to recover my ICP account, the Anchor was recognized but my seed phrase was not.

Get this error message
"Failed to authenticate using this seed phrase. Did you enter it correctly?"

I have laboured and tried many attempt to recover my account and funds but hitherto to no avail.

I had to source for help till I get here. Please I need a way out as my funds and assets are locked out from reach.

OP's duplicated the question -> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/failed-to-authenticate-using-this-seed-phrase/15521

So this thread can be closed.
