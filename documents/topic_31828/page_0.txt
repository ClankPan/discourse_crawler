Can you make an NFT such that only the owner has the permissions to view it?

Depends on where you store it. What I've found so far:

- On IPFS or BitTorrent, no.
- On ICP natively, kind-of, but it's hard and not good for truly private data until vetkeys.
- (my preference), ArWeave via the Irys SDK, you can use their encrypted uploader, and give the NFT owner the key: https://docs.irys.xyz/developer-docs/provenance-toolkit/encrypted-uploader

I'm sure there are other ways but I just moved to ArWeave for some nft work.
