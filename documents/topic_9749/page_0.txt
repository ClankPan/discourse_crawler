getting this error when i try to deploy to ic

```
An error happened during communication with the replica: error sending request for url (https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/wsxna-waaaa-aaaam-qaa2a-cai/read_state): http2 error: protocol error: not a result of an error
```

cmd used:

```
dfx deploy --network ic --no-wallet
```

this appears towards the end of the deployment.. if that helps
but i am not sure what or why this is happening

Any help here is much appreciated

My team got the same error, but not after retrying the deployment. The message states that it's an http2 error, so a retry like with any failed http request seems to do the trick.
