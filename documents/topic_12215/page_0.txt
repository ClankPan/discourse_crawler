Hello, everyone. I'm a unit from Hong Kong，We participated in the Pre-sale round of DFINITY in 2018. Our account has not received any ICP tokens for the past three months since February 2022.

We did a KYC verification through the email link sent by the project party in June 2021, and binded the wallet address used for the pre-sale round. Our KYC-certified wallet address is: e0b0(e0b07d90f2a350996427c300cc9917f74320fd21f7f5d5bd33e3d10c2d6f7110). Every month, we would receive ICP tokens sent by account e97e(e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926). However we did not receive it in February, March and April of 2022. Thus, we checked the transaction records of account e97e and found some problems:

1. The Pre-sale tokens are not credited directly to our KYC account, but to account e97e first, and subsequently to our account e0b0;

2. Account e97e did not transfer ICP to our KYC account e0b0 in February, March and April 2022. However, account e97e transferred 23702 ICPs to an account 9916 on 2022/3/17 06:52:44 UTC and 2022/4/12 17:09 respectively. But account 9916 is not ours.

Our question is: Why are the monthly pre-sale ICP neuron-unlocked tokens not directly sent to our KYC account e0b0 every month, but transferred to our KYC account via an intermediate account e97e that is susceptible to human intervention?

On February 26, 2022, we reported the situation to support@dfinity.org through Mr. Herbert, our person-in-charge in China. After support replied us via email on March 15, they went silent. As of today, the 16th of April, our doubts still have not been resolved.

This is my proposal：https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55168

Request DFINITY OFFICIAL and DFINITY Foundation for assistance in investigating the following:

1. Is the account e97e officially controlled by the DFINITY OFFICIAL?

2. If the account e97e is not officially controlled by the DFINITY OFFICIAL could the foundation provide evidence? Who controls this account and how it is created？ This is of utmost importance to us. We need this evidence to continue to trace the ICP that has not arrived，For example, recovery through national legal institutions, but evidence needs to be collected,If you need the information provided KYC by me, you can cooperate at any time，Thank you!

大家好，我是来自香港的一家单位，我们参与了2018年Dfinity的Pre-sale round,我们的账号从2022年2月份开始已经有三期没有收到ICP。

我们在2021年6月份通过项目方发的邮件链接做的KYC，同时绑定了发放预售轮的钱包地址，我们kyc认证的钱包地址是：e0b0(e0b07d90f2a350996427c300cc9917f74320fd21f7f5d5bd33e3d10c2d6f7110），每个月我都会收到来自账号e97e（e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926）发的icp，但是2022年的2月份、3月份、4月份我们都没有收到；我们去查了账号e97e的交易记录，发现了一些问题：

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926

1、Pre-sale token没有直接发放到我们的kyc账号，而是先发放到账号e97e，再发到我的kyc账号e0b0；

2、账号e97e在2022年2月份、3月份、4月份没有将icp转我的kyc账号e0b0，并且账号e97e分别在2022/3/17 06:52:44 UTC和2022/4/12 17:09:21 UTC转了23702icp到账号9916，但是账号9916不是我们的；

我们的疑问是：为什么每个月pre-sale的ICP神经元解锁不是直接发到我们的kyc账号e0b0，而是通过一个中间的可以被人为控制的账号e97e转到我们的kyc账号？

2022年2月26号我们通过中国区负责人herbert先生将情况反馈给support@dfinity.org,3月15号support给我们回了邮件之后，就再也没有给我们回信息，截止到今天4月16号我们的疑问也没有得到解决？

这是我发起提案：https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55168

请求Dfinity官方和Dfinity Foundation协助调查以下内容：

账号e97e是否是你们官方控制的？

如果账号e97e不是官方控制的，能否提供证据证明，这个账号是谁在控制，通过什么方式创建的，这个对我们很重要，我们需要有这些证据来继续追查没有到账的icp，比如通过法律手段追回，但是需要收集证据，如果需要我这边提供kyc的资料随时可以配合，谢谢！

This is terrible. I hope the official can help me to check it carefully.

Why would you submit this as an NNS proposal?

-------------------------

theeautumnwalker | 2022-05-15 02:10:21 UTC | #5

hi, I am one token holder of icp as well, i am just wondering if your problem has been solved or still unsolved?

At present, the foundation is already investigating, and I would like to thank Mr. Herbert, Asia GM, for his help.

says it right there in the post that official dfinity support stopped responding and went silent months ago, so this probably forces them to revisit the issue. i would have done the same

1. I don't think it's true dfinity went silent, see this twitter thread for more info https://twitter.com/herbertyang/status/1515569553652166656:
> After establishing the social graph of 5 persons and 6 email addresses (they really need to go Web3), it appears that an ex-employee of the proposer may have run away with the wallet 9926. The proposer was led by this ex-employee into believing that her wallet 7110 has been updated as she expected, while in fact it never happened. From DFINITY's end, the wallet has always been 9926 under the name of this investor from the beginning based on its KYC record. This ex-employee is believed to be the one who controls 9926. He left the proposer's company in late 2021 and has since then cut off contact with everyone.


2. The [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55168) was spectacularly rejected. Does that mean dfinity should've just ignored it? 

The NNS is just the wrong place for things like this.
