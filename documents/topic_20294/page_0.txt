Since I want to calculate how filled is my canister's heap memory, I need to know if I should compare `rts_heap_size()` divide by `4000000000` or `some other variable` that my canister can provide. If I have to use `some other variable`, what variable or function i can use to get the fixed allocated/maximum heap memory for my Motoko canister? 

Thank you.

You probably want to divide by rts_memory_size() which is the number of Wasm memory bytes currently used by the canister (i.e. Wasm `MemorySize` instruction (Wasm page count) x 65536 (Wasm page size, in bytes)), currently limited by 4GiB since we are using 32-bit wasm.

Some more explanation is here:

Hi claudio

As for the `rts` values: `memory_size` is the current size of the Wasm memory array (mostly the same as the canister memory size). This can only grow, never shrink in Wa

Thank you, claudio, for the reply. If i understand correctly, the value of `rts_memory_size` keeps on increasing based on how much a canister use. I did test this on Motoko Playground and keep inserting 1 million Nats, and everytime the `heap_size` about to reach the `memory_size`, the `memory_size` increased, which is behaving as what you guys described. 

So does this mean if i want to get how filled my canister is, i should `rts_heap_size` divide with `4294967296`. If so, then this heap size limit is fixed forever yes? Also thanks for correcting me that it's 4 GiB, not 4GB.

oh nevermind!
i found this

Currently, the wasm heap is capped at 4GiB so we cannot expand it further.

So i can actually used the fixed number to check if my canister is almost filled like so:
```
public func isFilled() : Bool {
  return rts_heap_size() / 4294967296 * 100 > 99;
}
```
thanks for your time, claudio
