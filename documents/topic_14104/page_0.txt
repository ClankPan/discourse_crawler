Which iPhone version are you using?

Can you provide a screenshot (pm are fine) of what you mean with "but if i click all buttons dont work"?

thanks for the feedback. if you click some buttons on the voting, accounts or canisters pages, does it works out?

I want to know if ALL buttons does not work or "just" the buttons on the neurons page

Did you plan to upgrade your device? I've got iOS 15.5 and it works for me so asking myself if that can be related.

Yes, happy to hear that!

Not sure but I have the feeling that the css `inset` property we use for the modal, despite of being officially supported by Safari as of version 14.5 (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=inset)) is actually buggy on iOS older version.

For the record, it looks like the issue was indeed the css property `inset` which despite being listed as supported according [spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/inset) seems to be buggy on some not up-to-date devices. Therefore we pollyfied and replaced `inset` with boring css `top, right, bottom, left` ([PR #1073](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/10739)) props to support such devices too.

Workaround has been proposed on mainnet today.

Seems Apple is trying their best to make Safari the new Internet Explorer for web devs with their alternative and non standard compliant way of doing things.

Hiring [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons) improved the communication around Safari and they began to ship interesting features to reduce the gap - e.g. subgrid or web push notifications recently (Safari beta 16 [release notes](https://webkit.org/blog/12824/news-from-wwdc-webkit-features-in-safari-16-beta/#web-inspector-extensions)). So it seems at least that they try to improve a bit, in addition to recent EU law about their monopolistic position on iOS, things hopefully will move on a bit to avoid the a full internet explorer scenario ðŸ¤ž.
