Hi everyone

We have just [proposed to upgrade Internet Identity](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/76936) to a [new release](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/tag/release-2022-08-23).

You can test this build on here: https://fgte5-ciaaa-aaaad-aaatq-cai.ic0.app/
Use this demo application to test the login flow: https://ec6lp-3iaaa-aaaad-aaavq-cai.ic0.app
**Note:** You cannot use your regular anchor on this deployment and will have to register a new one.

We are happy to answer questions or get feedback about this new II release.

Have a nice day!

How often does II get released? On a regular cadence or at specific stopping points?

Also, what are all of the canisters that fall under the “NNS Canister Upgrade” proposal type for System Canister Management proposals?

How about upgrading the contracts to have the option of automatically sending the matured $icp to the original wallet used to transfer? It would provide more reassurance for stakers who may lose their device or remove browser history.

Hi @justmythoughts

> How often does II get released? On a regular cadence or at specific stopping points?

We don't have a regular release cycle but release whenever there is something new. Releases usually happen at least once a month.

> Also, what are all of the canisters that fall under the “NNS Canister Upgrade” proposal type for System Canister Management proposals?

All canisters hosted on the NNS subnet fall under that proposal type. Currently, there are the following canisters hosted in the NNS subnet:
* registry
* governance
* ledger
* ledger archive
* root
* cycles-minting
* lifeline
* genesis-token
* identity
* nns-dapp

Hi @icpfan
Thanks for this suggestion. I think this is a feature request for the NNS dapp. Please raise this issue in a separate thread.
