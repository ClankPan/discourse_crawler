I am trying to test out Bitcoin integration using PocketIC. I've installed ckBTC minter, KYT, and ledger canisters. I am able to retrieve btc address with `get_btc_address` call to ckBTC canister, but when I call the `update_balance` method, I get this error:
```
Err(TemporarilyUnavailable("management call 'bitcoin_get_utxos' failed: the canister queue is full"))
```
I wonder what this error means and if there's a way to make ckBTC minter work in PocketIC?

My ckBTC minter configuration is:
```
    MinterArg::Init(crate::utils::btc::InitArgs {
        btc_network: BtcNetwork::Regtest,
        ecdsa_key_name: "master_ecdsa_public_key_fscpm-uiaaa-aaaaa-aaaap-yai".to_string(),
        retrieve_btc_min_amount: 100_000,
        ledger_id: ledger,
        max_time_in_queue_nanos: 100,
        min_confirmations: Some(12),
        mode: Mode::GeneralAvailability,
        kyt_fee: Some(2000),
        kyt_principal: Some(kyt),
    })
```

And naturally, I have Bitcoin regtest chain running on the port 18444

Unfortunately, PocketIC does not yet support testing Bitcoin integration. There might be a way to make ckBTC minter work in PocketIC though if the minter (for the sake of testing) could be manually initialized with some BTC funds.
