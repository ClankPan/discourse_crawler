I recently updated to dfx 0.8.4 and the latest Motoko library and noticed that Array.append is deprecated. Before, I was using an array which would work for appending/sorting/filtering. I was transferring arrays to buffers, but buffers do not have similar sorting and filtering functionality. Is there something I'm missing? Or do I just need to implement these things (which seems a bit counterintuitive?) Also can't directly convert a Buffer to an array for these functionalities it seems
