Hello :slight_smile: 

I have some interrogations on the basics dfx commands : dfx canister create / dfx build / dfx install /dfx deploy.

If I understood well : 

- *dfx canister create* => Registers an id for your futur canisters and stores the ID in the canisters_id.jsons file.
- *dfx build* => Compile your source code into a WebAssembly module ; create javascripts representation of the canister interface and put all the created files into a directory .dfx/local/canister (when you are deploying locally).
- *dfx install* => Deploy the previous created folder with the WASM module and javascript files on the IC.

But what about the command *dfx deploy* ? Does it do the 3 previous steps in one ? 

Thank you; have a good day :slightly_smiling_face: .

`dfx deploy` does all these steps yes, note that it runs `dfx canister install --mode upgrade`, which allows you to maintain canister state. 

You can run `dfx deploy` for all canisters, or choose a canister with `dfx deploy <canister-name>` .
