1. i have pledge chat, sonic, kinic in sns... There are also some that are not involved in the pledge, as the number of tokens in sns is increasing, can I customize it when selecting tokens on the voting page so that I can only see a list of the ones that I am involved in the pledge?
2. In the https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/. sns section of the site for the sns pledge earnings, average voting rights, average earnings, etc. to show whether to improve a little, the data can be viewed is very limited.
