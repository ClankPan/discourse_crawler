Did anyone try to implement an actor to serve as proxy re-encryption? Motoko/Rust either is good. Appreciate if you can share the code. 


Notes: I guess PRE agent is a very good use case for IC. PRE requires semi-trust and some computation power, where IC perfect fits. Just verify the hash of WSAM of PRE and leads the actor can be fully trustless(no more semi). The application can be very wide including email redirection, subscription management, E-voting and data sharing control.
