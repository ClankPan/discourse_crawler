Not correct, that would be true for copyleft licenses like GPL, the MIT license allows the use in closed proprietary software.

I think this whole saga demonstrates that a few whales unfortunately have too much power on the IC today. 

Without having a strong opinion on the matter at hand, it does appear that a minority of folks have squashed the will of the majority. Oligarchy at play. 

Let’s see if people parties help to fix. I do find it ironic indeed that the whales behind the no vote were worried that IC_Devs would have too much power haha.

Disclaimer: Personal Opinion

ICDevs requested the "reject" voters come forward and voice their opinion. They came forward and let their concerns known.

If they own the governance tokens (ICP) and they decided to vote to "reject", that's their right. If ICDevs goes on to contribute further and the token owners change their mind, they'll vote "accept" if ICDevs puts up a proposal again

But attacking the token owners for their reasons will just DISCOURAGE future "reject" voters to come forward and participate in discourse.

They own the governance tokens to decide and they have the most at stake if "not enough decentralization" leads to a failure of the network.

My 2 cents

This is *probably** true, but isn't that how the NNS was designed to work? The NNS provides greater voting power to individuals and groups that make larger commitments to the network. At the same time, it allows anyone (even those with small amounts of money) to acquire voting power through liquid democracy. So it's not intended to be a 1 neuron = 1 vote system.

It seems to me like we're only upset with these whales because they voted against the "majority" opinion. Would we still be upset if these same whales voted in favor of the proposal? Would we be able to get any votes passed without the participation of seed investors?

I agree with @saikatdas0790. Instead of focusing on the voting power held by these stakeholders we should be focused on finding common ground. But we can't do that if we discourage "reject" voters from coming forward.

'*' - I only say "probably" because we really don't know how many individuals are represented by a single neuron.

This is exactly how it is supposed to work. Some people will have more voting powers than others. They will have differing opinions. It is important to know the real reason (which was elucidated after more discussion) so that either we agree or agree to disagree or somewhere in between. We can also have different philosophical mindsets (i.e. GPL vs MIT licenses vs not respecting licenses at all).

Personally, I'm upset about the  centralized distribution of voting power not because of this particular vote, but be because it undermines the entire project. Take censorship. A core selling point put forward by Dom and Dfinity to developers, users and investors is censorship resistance.

Speaking strictly about resistance in relation to AWS (think Parler) , banks (OnlyFans) etc the IC is censorship resistant, sure. But a handful of whales could censor from within. It would arguably be bad business for them, but the point is trust in a few hundred individuals is required. 

I write "a few hundred" because I don't know the smallest number of individuals that together reach majority voting power. Which I see as a problem in and of itself. Let me know if that number or an estimate is available. I know indexing of neurons according to type (seed, etc) has been suggested elsewhere.

Hopefully People's parties will be used to balance out voting power. In my view it's in the whales interests as well.

You can find information about voting power at: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance

At the time of this post, there is ~404M voting power across the NNS stakeholders. When you talk about "majority voting power" it's important to note that there is both an absolute majority and a simple majority rule.

Achieving an absolute majority (>202M VP) would means the outcome is set in stone.
Achieving a simple majority means you've received at least 3% of the total voting power (~12M VP) and the voting period has ended.

As demonstrated with this proposal, achieving 3% does not necessarily mean you will win. A controversial proposal will likely see the voting period extended by the wait-for-quiet algorithm until the maximum voting period is reached. This would give plenty of time for additional votes to come in.

For a very serious topic (like censorship) I highly doubt a simple 3% majority would be all it takes.

-------------------------

Comfortable_Reply_56 | 2022-01-17 15:53:07 UTC | #125

Thanks for the reply, but I don't see how one could use the dashboard to answer the question. The smallest number of individuals that together have 50% voting power. Am I missing something?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-01-17 15:59:23 UTC | #126

We also need to keep in mind that only 13.5% of total voting power actually cast their votes on the ICDevs proposal.  At most, Dfinity Foundation holds 24% of all ICP tokens and Internet Computer Association holds 4% of all ICP tokens based on the Messari report at genesis.  I don't currently know how much voting power these two organization hold, but they intentionally abstained from voting (rightly so IMHO) and there was a significant amount of voting power that were following them that did not vote.  Today this is not painful for those neuron holders because missing one vote is negligible, but the push toward decentralization must also include incentives for as many neurons to vote as possible even if DF and ICA feel they need to abstain.  If these incentives are significant, then I think people will follow other neurons and the voting power distribution would change accordingly.  I think this is an evolution and we need to give it time.  We need to keep pushing toward policies that we can agree will move us in the direction of decentralization and high voter participation.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-17 15:59:28 UTC | #127

No, you're right. This won't tell you the number of individuals (referring to humans). You can do some digging to figure out the minimum number of neurons required to achieve a majority.

But like I said in my other post; we have no way of knowing if 1 neuron represents the interests of 1 human, or 10 humans. Just like we don't know if 10 neurons are controlled by 10 humans or just 1.

We know that seed investors have one of the largest allocations so its fair to assume that the VP is not as decentralized as we like. But I don't see how we change that in the short term. People parties will likely help but I don't think it will be the great equalizer everyone is expecting it to be. Personally, I expect the voting power to further decentralize with time and inflation.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-17 16:20:39 UTC | #128

How grave do you think it is relative to other networks? 

@Comfortable_Reply_56 seems to imply that  “a few hundred” is insufficient. I wonder how many independent node operators would have to collude to censor BTC or ETH. Just doing a quick Google I found this tweet by Vitalik from 2020 that stated ETH had a nakamoto coefficient of 34. That’s a lot less than a few hundred.

https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1333738057162362880?s=21

Fwiw I agree that we should strive for greater decentralization but I’m having a hard time believing that the NNS is that much worse than the majority of other networks.

From what I can tell I'd need to manually click expand on 70 000 neurons, note the voting power in a spreadsheet, and then I'd have the answer in terms of neurons - a useful proxy. 

I realize this forum is filled with people who would know how to program this procedure, probably quite easily, but I can't. 

Ic.Rocks allows you to sort the neurons by ICP amount but that list is incomplete as far as I know.

[quote="tsetse, post:116, topic:9363, full:true"]
I doubt if cultural issues were at the heart of the ‘no’ votes by villa-straylight’s group of whales, but since the American focus of IC Devs was mentioned at one point, I am placing on record my own feeling of uneasiness with regard to IC Devs as opposed to CycleDAO. When I look at the CycleDAO website, I see a group fairly diverse in nationality, who have boosted the ICP ecosystem as individuals and have come together to help it as a collective. When I do the same for IC Devs, I see a website filled with requests for donations, donations, donations, and a meagre list of bounties handed out. It doesn’t convey the feeling of an organisation that has done much for the ecosystem. This kind of website for a non-profit might be something that Americans are used to and consider appropriate, but it did put me off considerably. If the response is that IC Devs hasn’t done much yet but has great plans for the future, I think it is appropriate to wait till a few of those plans fructify before giving it such substantial voting power.
[/quote]

The US-based thing has come up a good bit so I thought I'd formally comment on it. The 501c3 status is a hack that voters have put into the United States tax code that lets private citizens divert some of their tax obligations to non-profits that focus on initiatives that are personal to them or where they think the private sector can do a better job than the government.  It is, in effect, an anti-government law.  It helps some with tax collection as one is encouraged to report their donations for a deduction, but the spirit is to let the people have some of the value back for their own means.

ICDevs choose a 501c3 structure for the acceleration that can occur for this. If you are a US based whale organization that has made $10,000,000 in maturity in a year you can donate up to $3,000,000 to ICDevs and reduce your tax burden. We get to use that to accelerate the IC through education and scientific discovery without being taxed, hopefully in the process, improving the value of the ICP that you still have tucked away in dissolving neurons.  This was the idea and one that we had validated via a number of tax experts.  In reality, probably due to the bear market in ICP that started about the time we launched, this didn't resonate with many people.  The lack of clarity on what you actually owe taxes on is an issue as well.

We're basically trying to hack the tax code to the advantage of the IC. This puts some restrictions on us like our board needs to be US citizens and we have to follow our non-profit charter, but we have broad agency beyond that.  I think our developer advisory board is majority non-US citizens...and that group will be directing most of the decisions.

As far as asking for donations, we've been pretty clear how the organization operates and the details of how we roll out funds is transparent.  We're hoping to build a long-term endowment for funding education and scientific discovery on the IC, so 2/3 of our donations that come in go into that 8-year neuron.  The remaining 1/3 is split into 2/3 to the community fund that funds bounties and 1/3 administration fund that, at this point, just pays for lawyers and accountants but will hopefully pay for some full-time community-building staff down the road.  The maturity that comes off our neuron is fed back into that same formula.

It is just a sausage machine that needs the crank turned. If you want to see more bounties, donate more money to turn the crank.  We've been trying to put out at least one a week with some slow down for the holidays.  Four of the bounties are closed or about to be closed and have produced two motoko libraries for creating unique IDs, a community integration project(DAB + stoic), and an essential dev plugin that decodes CBOR values.  We're a completely part-time volunteer org at this point and will be until the budget allows for it.  I think the output stands up to pretty much any other organization in the community that has been funded with less than $30k so far.

* Disclosure I am on the developer board for ICDevs

I've been deeply pondering what has gone on here, and I believe this situation highlights a concern for all IC participants who seek the success of the IC (and thus possibly the value of their ICP).

I'm not that concerned with this specific proposal that hasn't passed. But I am concerned that a few whales are able to sway the vote away from the will of many other participants with less voting power. This is an assumption of course, I do not know the actual numbers of humans involved in the votes.

Let me try to lay out some fundamental reasoning for why we do not want the amount of ICP staked to be the only determinant of voting power:

We're trying to create a system of government that leads to true or correct outcomes. We all seem to agree that very centralized decision making will not always lead to the best outcomes, and thus we're against that form of government.

We also all seem to agree that a decentralized form of government in the form of a democracy will lead to better outcomes than a centralized form of government. But our democracy is far different than the traditional/modern democracies implemented by nations around the world. Our democracy only cares about how much ICP is owned by a voting agent.

Why is that? The fundamental reasoning seems to be that because the value/price of ICP is inextricably linked to the success of the system that is being governed (the Internet Computer), then the more ICP that a voting agent owns, the more motivation they will have to make true or correct votes.

Democracy is a decentralized truth-seeking process, and we've quantified each agent's truth-seeking capabilities into one metric: ICP staked.

I think this is fundamentally flawed. I do believe that each person who owns and stakes ICP is generally motivated to make correct decisions regarding the IC so as to maximize the future value of their ICP. But I also believe there is a limit to the effect that a person's ICP balance has on their ability to benefit the network through correct decision-making.

What is the difference in decision-making motivation between someone who owns 100 ICP vs 1000 ICP? 1000 ICP vs 10,000 ICP? 10,000 ICP vs 100,000 ICP?

I don't know the answers, but I think we can agree that at some point there is a diminishing return on decision-making motivation/capability and ICP owned.

I think we should attempt to approximate this extra decision-making capability based on ICP owned. Here's my suggestion: let's explore some combination of 1-person-1-vote (because each human being inherently has some ability to make correct decisions, and the combination of many varied opinions is very valuable) and a voting power cap, possibly logarithmic (similar to quadratic voting).

1-person-1-vote with some form of voting power cap may maximize the correct decision-making power of the entire network. And that's really what all rational ICP holders should want, a network that is maximized for making correct decisions regarding the Internet Computer and its native asset ICP.

There is nothing wrong with Voting how they like, but since they have such huge stake - they should also be held responsible for these **anti-trust-like practices**. What they did was also delay the ecosystem's growth in the crossfire. 

Seedbros it is your neuron and your money, but the voting power on the network governance ***must not solely depend on the number of tokens one owns.*** 

Does not seem so decentralized. Few people discussing the future of the project sitting inside a room..(you know like board meetings of Web2 companies..) This is a snowball and will continue growing until it crashes into something. I just hope the collateral damage isn't too much.

dfisher | 2022-01-17 18:57:29 UTC | #143

It seems there is consensus that having staked ICP be the main driver of voting power might not be the best governance design. On the one hand we don't want an oligarchy. On the other hand, I don't think folks want 1 person 1 vote either. Firstly, it is impossible in an annoymous context. Secondly, there are benefits to giving folks who have more at stake a greater say. What we want is something in between that is closer to 1 person 1 vote than the oligarchy we have today. 

Yes, people parties will help. Give the average staker a lot more voting power and hence rewards power. This will help balance out the whales. 

But what if we figured out a way to disaggregate voting power from staking rewards power? I am not sure why we have it as a given assumption that voting power must equal staking rewards power. Our modern society of 1 person 1 vote has nothing to do with our individual wealth. They are two separate things. 

One idea I had was to reduce the voting power (but not staking rewards power) that can come from any one PrincipleID. Even though seed investors hold an enormous number of ICP my understanding is that the 48 neurons given to each investor at launch are mostly linked to 1 PrincipleID per person. So long as PrincipleIDs cannot be transferred we could if we wanted to limit folks voting power per PrincipleID. To do this fairly we would have to limit their voting power but not limit their staking rewards power. 

Hopefully that was clear. And hopefully a Dfinity engineer on this thread can opine on whether what I am suggesting is even technically possible.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-17 18:59:52 UTC | #144

I’d also point out that any significant change like that would likely require support (a vote) from Dfinity. I doubt these whales would be willing to give up their power willingly.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-17 19:32:41 UTC | #145

I'm not sure what you're referring to, a bot to do what? Proof of personhood is essential to any kind of cap on voting power, so the aim is to stop individuals from duplicating themselves through bots.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-17 19:31:43 UTC | #146

We absolutely need proof of personhood or we cannot implement any limits on voting power, since a user could create unlimited numbers of accounts with any amount of ICP.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-01-17 20:17:52 UTC | #147

Yes that is true. My suggestion of putting a cap on the voting power (not staking rewards power) per PrincipleID without proof of personhood may still help with voting centralization for the following reasons:

1. **Existing neurons.**  The whales today have a ton of ICP spread across many neurons but that are linked to a single PrincipleID per person. Many of that voting power is locked for 8 years and may never dissolve. Folks wouldn't dissolve just to get extra votes in 8 years time if there was not an economic incentive to do so. 

2. **New Neurons.** For new neurons that are created, it would be administratively burdensome for one individual to create a ton of new neurons linked to different PrincipleIDs in order to get that extra voting power. That extra hurdle may dissuade people if the economic result was the same.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-17 20:21:30 UTC | #148

Interesting...but with scripts that administrative burden might be low enough that it would still be worth it, not sure.

I do think that keeping voting rewards equivalent to what they are today is enticing.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-01-18 04:02:08 UTC | #149

I'd like to offer an alternate perspective.  

Decision making authority in NNS governance is not based on staked ICP alone.  It is intentionally about voting power, which is derived from staked ICP, neuron dissolve delay, neuron age, and liquid democracy.  Voting rewards are also intentionally weighted higher for participants with the highest dissolve delay and age, not the highest staked ICP.  It is a very reasonable assumption that people with the longest dissolve delay will vote with the long term best interest of the IC because they want to make sure the decisions that are made will be in their best financial interest.  

While I would prefer for ICDevs to be a named Followee at this time, I think @villa-straylight provided arguments why a group of long term investors with significant voting power believes it is not in the long term best interest of the IC at this time.  They cast their votes accordingly and the NNS governance system worked exactly how it is supposed to work even though I wish the result were different.

Neuron 28 is owned by ICA and holds just over 20 total votes, yet it is by far the most influential neuron in the entire IC governance system.  When ICA casts the vote for neuron 28, about 405M votes are cast automatically through liquid democracy because it has been the default Followee for All Topics since genesis.  NNS decisions are not made by whales.  Decisions are made by organizations that are capable of gathering sufficient voting power through liquid democracy.  Or in the case of the ICDevs proposal, it was decided by a group of neurons that were sufficiently well organized and aligned on intentions to reject the proposal.  

Yet only 13.5% of total voting power voted on this proposal.  That is 86.5% of total voting power in the NNS that abstained.  For the sake of this discussion point, I think it would be overly generous to assume that DF and ICA combined holds 33% of total voting power.  If true, then that leaves at least 53.5% of total voting power that did not vote because their Followee intentionally abstained from the vote.  The voting dynamics would be very different if those votes had been cast.  

In my opinion, if we want to further advance NNS governance, it should come from properly incentivizing full participation in governance and from attracting new participants to NNS governance.  Dfinity has already recognized this need and put forth proposals to affect this change.  One of the proposals has already passed and another has been in deliberation for months.  I believe the IC community needs to rally behind these ideas and recognize the governance implications they would carry.  

Proposal [34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485) has already passed the motion proposal phase, but the code hasn't gone into effect yet.  It has a lot of governance implications including incentivizing people to select Followees other than DF and ICA for Governance proposals.  It will also enable DF and ICA to cast votes on certain Governance proposals without automatically executing liquid democracy for every NNS participant.  It is the proposal that inspired cycle_dao, ICDevs, and ICPMN to make proposals to become named Followees in the NNS dApp.  Once proposal 34485 goes into effect, it may only take a few additional proposals before people realize that they are not getting their full voting rewards and they will be looking for new Followees for Governance proposals.  Liquid democracy voting patterns will change.

People parties is intended to attract new NNS governance participants.  The most interesting part of that concept is the integration with tokenomics because it could offer very favorable incentives to a lot of new people.  My perception is that the IC community so far has under estimated to potential impact that people parties could have on decentralization of the IC.  We have focused too much on the mechanics of proof of humanity, whether or not a 3rd party could be developing proof of humanity, and/or complaining about the name of people parties.  The reason the people parties concept is important is the tokenomics integration and the effects it could have on decentralization.

These are both really important concepts that will have big impact on the governance and tokenomics.

tsetse | 2022-01-18 04:51:55 UTC | #150

Let me make my perspective on the issue clearer. I will never vote to give huge power to an organisation basically restricted to one country. The 'world computer' has to mean something. Further, if that one country is the United States, that makes the situation worse from my perspective. The US has too much power as it is, since Google, Facebook, Twitter and Netflix dominate the world. With regulatory frameworks so fluid, a situation could well arise where IC Devs, beholden to US law, makes choices that aren't in the interests of non-US ICP holders. 
Poker players will know what happened on Black Friday in 2011, when the US DoJ locked down a bunch of sites, took away domain names and froze accounts, affecting every player on those sites across the globe. I can completely understand why IC Devs has proceeded in the way it has, I just want to make clear why it wasn't only a few whales that cast votes in favour of CycleDAO but against ICDevs: it was also people like myself, though of course the big holders' votes were the decisive ones. I do feel a sense of entitlement in some of the pro-ICDevs comments (not yours, Skilesare) on this thread, when what might be called for is more introspection.

[/quote]

Each reason listed here besides liquid democracy is derived principally from the initial ICP stake. The voting power bonus from neuron dissolve delay and neuron age are calculated from the initial ICP stake. The ICP stake is the basis for voting power, besides followers.

I do not suggest we remove liquid democracy, we want people to follow those they trust and have the ability to gain outsized voting power based on those human relationships.

I'm suggesting we cap the voting power after applying the bonuses, maybe logarithmically, and then allow the regular liquid democracy to play out.

The fundamental reason/assumption is that at some point your initial ICP stake will not motivate you to be a better voter. The current system is designed without that assumption, and I believe that will lead to a suboptimal decision-making body.

Let me make my perspective on the issue clearer. I will never vote to give huge power to an organisation basically restricted to one country. The ‘world computer’ has to mean something. Further, if that one country is the United States, that makes the situation worse from my perspective. The US has too much power as it is, since Google, Facebook, Twitter and Netflix dominate the world. With regulatory frameworks so fluid, a situation could well arise where IC Devs, beholden to US law, makes choices that aren’t in the interests of non-US ICP holders.
[/quote]

It is certainly anyone's right to hold these opinions, but I'll point out that there is absolutely no evidence that the US government has in the past or will in the future put any significant restriction on non-profits around the causes that they support...especially when it comes to technology and industry.  Most of the restrictions are around limiting profits flowing to individuals in inappropriate ways.  You can put as high a bar on things as you'd like, but I'll point out that organizations like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance are also US 501c3 organizations and supported organizations like MakerDAO and the Ethererum Foundation.

If any location inside the US is too high a hurdle, I'd encourage you to support an organization like ICDevs in a jurisdiction that you approve of. We'll be happy to work with and pool our resources with them to move the IC forward.

> I do believe that each person who owns and stakes ICP is generally motivated to make correct decisions regarding the IC so as to maximize the future value of their ICP. But I also believe there is a limit to the effect that a person’s ICP balance has on their ability to benefit the network through correct decision-making.

> What is the difference in decision-making motivation between someone who owns 100 ICP vs 1000 ICP? 1000 ICP vs 10,000 ICP? 10,000 ICP vs 100,000 ICP?

You can read through multiple opinions on this in this thread, but basically the assumption is that wealth has diminishing effects on human beings at a certain point.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-18 16:39:48 UTC | #156

Most people I have discussed this with have agreed with me on this.

Is there a material difference in your choices when you have 1,000,000 ICP at stake versus 1,000,000,000? I think so, but as wealth grows I do not think decision-making capability grows at equal rates. Eventually it is a diminishing return, perhaps always growing but again not by much (relatively speaking).

What is your argument against this?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-18 16:45:40 UTC | #158

I'm just proposing that the best way to protect ourselves from bad actors (bad decisions) is to combine the innate decision-making power of each person interested in the IC (1-person-1-vote) with the added decision-making power that their personal ICP wealth will give them (I propose some logarithmic cap).

If there is no cap, then I fear that bad actors with a lot of ICP may have outsized influence that they do not deserve, and by deserve I mean strictly in a technical sense - their voting power does not match their ability to make decisions that benefit the IC.

We want the governing body of the IC to come to correct conclusions when voting. To do this, I'm saying we should maximize the decision-making capabilities of each voter and aggregate those decisions to come to a final conclusion. Uncapped voting power per individual based on ICP stake may undermine the whole system.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-18 16:48:43 UTC | #159

And in case the cap I'm proposing is confusing, I'm still proposing that people with more ICP have more voting power. I'm also not proposing we get rid of liquid democracy and follow relationships, nor lockup nor age bonuses.

I'm just proposing a non-linear voting power equation based on initial ICP stake. So the more ICP you have, the higher your voting power, but also the rate at which your voting power increases would decrease as your ICP stake increases.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-18 16:57:56 UTC | #161

I definitely agree it isn't time yet. I just want to start getting the idea out there and gaining consensus if possible.

For the next year I imagine the community will be experimenting with various proof of personhood mechanisms. We may even see one integrated into the IC's governance (people parties).

These developments will be very interesting and completely necessary to do any kind of vote cap.

Once we have a good proof of personhood working, I'm hoping multiple DAOs on the IC or elsewhere will experiment with various token voting models. I really think proof of personhood opens the doors to more than simple coin-based voting.

After many experiments elsewhere, perhaps it may then be time to bring what has been learned about various coin-voting methods into the IC.

-------------------------

jorgenbuilder | 2022-01-18 17:16:21 UTC | #162

I just want to chime in as a recent recipient of an IC Devs bounty. It seems that there is a notion out there that IC Devs has an agenda to push this experimental license on people. They've clearly communicated in this thread that this is simply not the case. It would be a shame to lose progress on the common goal of greater voting power distribution and more voting power for developers because of what is clearly (to me) a miscommunication.

I'm very bad about adding licenses to my work. [Here's the PR](https://github.com/jorgenbuilder/chrome-dfinity-decoder/pull/20) where IC devs requested to add a license to the repo they helped fund. It's MIT.

I see that there are other topics being discussed here, but I wanted to offer a data point on this licensing issue. It seems that the ARAKME experiment is being extrapolated into "the agenda of IC Devs" by some. In my experience, no such agenda exists.

-------------------------

jorgenbuilder | 2022-01-18 18:43:38 UTC | #165

...for the good of the IC, obviously. 😆I do not read any compelling evidence that IC Devs is a "bad actor," in this thread or elsewhere. What I see is that:

A) one project in their suit experimented with a license that you don't like. They have made no effort to promote this license, beyond flatly declaring it a failure. Extrapolating this to say they have nefarious rent-seeking intentions is very off-base.

B) they're too US-centric. Here, the same "this is the _world_ computer" argument should apply just as much to IC Devs and its (perhaps) US audience as it does to any other organization.

To me it seemed to be a reactionary measure because they’d got caught.

That was just one of many red flags. They can explain all they want but I just don’t believe them.
[/quote]

If you have other red flags or reasons that you don't believe me, please reach out.  I sort of get your argument that we don't have enough traction or funding yet to be "trusted" in the community yet, but I really don't understand what I/We have done to gain your opinion that we are unbelievable.

My original post at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/financing-software-built-for-the-internet-computer/7909 was clearly in a spirit of discussion, conversation, and experimentation.  It received no feedback

The two libraries that we sponsored at https://github.com/aviate-labs/ulid.mo and https://github.com/aviate-labs/uuid.mo/blob/main/LICENSE were both published with the Apache 2.0 license and I'm sure the author would be more than happy to confirm that I in no way tried to get him to use the @aramakme license.

When I re-raised the issue in https://forum.dfinity.org/t/candy-library-try-2-financing-software-on-the-ic/9861 I did so specifically to make sure that any profits benefited the community, in the hope that I could bring more attention to the desired topic at hand, and to expose findings of the experiment for others to learn from.  It would have been much easier to rug pull the people that invested time and effort into the original experiment and just to let it die on the vine. I did not do that.

The only outreach I had from anyone before the neuron proposal was from @borovan on the dev discord just after Christmas where I again expressed a desire to have a discussion and not to push "rent-seeking code". https://discord.com/channels/748416164832608337/748420568268800060/924765133396381716

A couple of days later I asked borovan if he wanted to engage in a public discussion about it and seek the best way to handle cycle sharing type code and he declined for his own valid reasons, but I also didn't know that there was a broader set of folks with the same concerns. He can confirm with you that I expressed a commitment to installing a generic license in the base code on 1/3 before the neuron proposal went live in a private chat. 

Since you've spoken up in this post I've addressed this topic with nothing but a consistent approach and clarified any issues that you've had concerns about.

It has become clear that some people are proactively reaching out to others in the community to imply that ICDevs.org can't be trusted.  Since we don't know who these folks are it is hard to counteract this narrative at the scale you've seemed to have managed to spread this meme.  I'm more than happy to discuss this with you and the others that have developed this opinion.

How about another proposal in a week - A proposal to include ICDevs as default follow-target neurons to the NNS. It just costs 1 ICP so should be fine I guess. 

Maybe ICDevs will provide more clarity to any concerns you expressed. Then let's discuss about proof of human and voting power distribution :D 

Sorry about the meme tho 😛

Anyone can put forward a proposal that could remove the Neuron from the front-end if there is any threat to the Network.

How about one to ensure that the Dfinity Foundation and ICA are kept as the only default follow neurons for the next year
[/quote]

I share the sentiment with you, but this will only drag everyone down. Many participants have put a lot of time and effort into this proposal, so it would be a shame to see it get wasted. I appreciate your responses, but It seems to me that you would rather create a lose-lose situation than let the ICDevs Neuron get to the front-end of NNS.

I hope you do respond to this ^ @villa-straylight, I'm curious what you think about this.

**Alliances are inevitable, but there is room for everyone on the Internet Computer**. As I said before, the growth and adoption will get delayed in the crossfire. 

How do we define impure motives? The voting threshold for governance proposal is **3%**, You ***have more than 8% of the total NNS Votes*** and voted against the proposal. For me, as a network participant, this is concerning regardless of which Neuron you rejected. What worries me is How it unfolded. What if the seed club decides to delete a Canister?

It did seem somewhat hypocritical to me.

[Hypercatallaxy — Democratic Hypercatallaxy ](http://catallax.info/hypercatallaxy) - he literally wrote a book about economic rent seeking.
[/quote]

I don’t know if there is a language barrier here or what, but it seems that every time you put words in my mouth you are expressing the exact opposite of my opinion or intent.

I’m happy to let my contributions here and elsewhere for the IC ecosystem stand on their own.

As far as my book goes, it is literally about **neutralizing** economic rent and making sure that workers gain access to the full output of their labor.  The entire point is to eliminate financial middlemen. If you are on the side of eliminating the ill effects of the collection of undue economic rent then I guarantee you that we are on the same side of that issue and have common goals. The spirit of the license was to create a system where developers could take middlemen out of the software creation processes. Does that turn software devs into the new middlemen?  Possibly.  The license was expressly open and forkable to neutralize that, but there are certainly even better solutions. We should discuss those and find a better solution. 

Our board was selected for their experience outside the world of the IC in order to help us level set, prioritize, and serve a broad set of developer needs that devs aren’t always focused on. Four members have worked directly on or recruited developers for decentralized and IC targeted projects and one is an international lawyer, which we felt might be handy to have around.  One built the initial smart contracts for Gitcoin Grants. Our executive advisor ran X-Prize and is currently spending most of his time working with Wyoming and other jurisdictions on their DAO infrastructure and enabling decentralized governance on a massive scale. The board knows their lack of expertise in specific IC-related things and has empowered our dev advisory board with most of the operational power in the organization.  Organizations are welcome to set themselves up however they see fit, and we've chosen to seek oversight from those that need developers, recruit developers, represent developers, and can provide an external lens on the effectiveness of the organization to change things outside of our IC bubble.

ICDevs is certainly trying to recruit voting power on the IC.  We believe that strong institutions are necessary for advancement and that an organization that represents developers and their interests is an important part of that ecosystem.   We are committed to limiting that voting power to issues that have some impact on developers and the developer experience inside the ecosystem.  Others we will leave to DFINITY and the ICA for now and elected neurons in the future. 

We are very committed to making sure that developers are not taken advantage of in these new ecosystems and that the proper amount of value accrues to those that are going to build the IC systems of tomorrow.  There are multiple pathways to that vision and we are not afraid to talk about any of them. Some structure has to be in place if you want developers to build for your platform. Maybe it is tokenization of platforms, maybe it is licenses, maybe it is quadratic funding of known public goods.  If we can't talk about these without being accusatory, derogatory, or straight up slanderous we don't have much hope of finding an answer.  Or I should rather say that the community here is going to do those things and have those conversations and if you continue to hide behind a veil and drum up clearly false narratives your opinion will likely be severely discounted.

If you have a solution as to how developers can be incentivized to write code that they release without any license or IP protections we are 100% all ears and will promote it from the mountain tops.  If the community decides that cycle-based payment for software services is an anti-pattern we'll gladly write it up and dissuade people from using those services.  As of now all we can derive from your statements is that someone with a lot of power on the IC thinks that developers should contribute code without a license and without any means of collecting value for their contribution. I don't think the devs that are going to build these platforms have any interest in being your serfs and we will certainly push back against that if that is your intent.

I personally think the whole point of this default-follow-neuron issue is anyway just cosmetic at this point. A gesture to be perceived as more decentralized. Actually this was the first vote with this much individual engagement, that I'm aware of. So that's the big win here, more and more individual engagement.
Not being displayed as default in the nns dapp, shouldn't stop ICDevs from following their goal and keeping up the work they are doing. While I understand this might be a bummer, it shouldn't make much of a difference, really.

I do think the name could be an issue for some, there are people working on this project for some years now that are all ICdevs but not part of this Texas non-profit.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-01-19 17:27:14 UTC | #182

There's a difference between the Developer Advisory Board and the actual board of the non-profit. I am on the Developer Advisory Board, as is @quint. See here: https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html

We are the ones who will be voting on the direction of ICDevs' resources according to the rules of ICDevs. The point is to give us power, collectively, to determine the direction of ICDevs.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-19 17:43:12 UTC | #183

I believe the intent behind updating the default followees was to provide stakeholders with a list of neurons that could be trusted to vote on all governance proposals. Mainly because Dfinity has decided to abstain from voting on them going forward.

I agree that not being on this list shouldn’t be perceived as being a major loss.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-19 17:50:28 UTC | #185

I understand that. But I don’t see how that proves intent to your potential followers. You’ve already been given extra VP for your commitment. Are you now suggesting that others should empower you even more for the same reason?

I think there are a lot of factors that could be at play. For example, how do I know you and your fellow seed investors don’t have large holdings in other major networks that you see as competing with the IC? Maybe you work somewhere like Ark Investment or Amun and you’re willing to vote against things that could hold the IC back long enough to profit off your other investments.

These are all hypotheticals but I don’t think that simply being a seed investor proves your intent.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-19 18:34:04 UTC | #188

You made this statement a little while earlier:

This was followed up with your response about being a "seed bro" and then that's why I addressed your response in the way I did. 

I honestly don't care about you being a seed investor. I just want to know why we should believe you have the IC's best intent in mind after making a statement about having shadowy figures in the background.

The other groups have disclosed who their members are. They've also posted articles explaining their position and were willing to answer questions on this forum about their intent. I believe It's this transparency that allowed you to make an informed decision about ICDevs. I just hope that your organization would offer a similar level of transparency.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2022-01-19 18:40:45 UTC | #189

This is also false.

Kevin specifically spent significant time with Dfinity engineers doing product discovery. While IC technicals were sparse at that point we were in very close contact with Dom and the dfinity team working to form enterprise strategies and collecting requirements.

I’m not salty that you have a bunch of ICP, I just wish I did so that I didn’t have to worry so much about how to provide for my family. Financial independence is wonderful! And 8 year staked neurons are even better.  Until I’m able to procure my own I aim to think deeply about how to recruit thousands of devs to the platform that also don’t have financial independence but want it.

The reality of the math is that in the next 2 days one of the 32 300,000 ICP neurons that voted against the proposal will make enough in maturity to donate to ICDevs to procure 6 seats(a majority) on the Developer Advisory Board that has the directive to drive our agenda and could recommend that we delete the offending license from the internet.

Something about this bothered me when I first read it, and now, reading a Twitter thread that had the same quote, I understand what. Please correct me if I am wrong, but the quote implies that Developer Advisory Board seats are on sale. Is it true that a relatively small donation could 'procure' a majority on the advisory board of ICDevs, which in turn would determine its agenda? Again, apologies if I misunderstood.

Icdev2dev | 2022-01-20 04:48:54 UTC | #201


To me, at an higher level, ability to buy ICP at seed level prices(0.03c) is also the ability to influence governance at a much broader level. So IC governance is also at sale, now. No, before someone jumps in, I am NOT  salty. Just saying.

Talk about rent-seeking. What are these ICPs staked in governance doing if not rent seeking? What "work" are they materially doing?  Nothing. At least there's some work being put in into developing Motoko code before asking for rent. 

 I am not involved in the rent-seeking portion of software work currently. I do see it as a neat and innovative way for content producers of generating revenue WITHOUT having to work for someone else.

 And NO, both of these are not rent-seeking.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-01-20 12:20:42 UTC | #203

We have what we think is a low bar for commitment. We are a nonprofit so all hurdles are suggested donations with other ways to meet the expected commitment.  The default ways are a liquid icp donation or a dedicated neuron where you keep the ICP and the maturity is donated to the organization. Folks that don’t have that level of ICP are welcome to make other arrangements.

In the same way you have to stake ICP to vote on the NNS we like to see some skin in the game for participation.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-01-20 13:54:13 UTC | #205

Fair enough, but if the bar is low enough, the person making the commitment might have more skin in a different game. I mean, there are people with literally billions of dollars at stake in competitor blockchains. Maybe something worth considering.

@villa-straylight I just wanna say, you're coming off as having an entitled and unwelcoming attitude. This is not the way our community should treat people trying to work on the IC. If you disagree with ICdev's proposal, you can do so in a cordial manner. If other dev organizations see how this community's whales treat newcomers, they are going to leave for other chains like Solana that have a very welcoming community.

I agree. We are a bit discerning about it and not going to just sign anyone up that shows up with Ico. We don't have to let everyone in at the board level and we will increasingly raise the commitment level as the org matures. The example.of “buying” seats.on that board was to draw a contrast. The level.of commitment will likely increase exponentially as the group grows and we reach an optimal size.

Kyle_Langham | 2022-01-26 18:54:35 UTC | #209

If I understand correctly, you are looking for the least number of entities needed to get 50% of voting power... if that's the case then it looks like the top 169 neurons get you to just over 50% of total NNS voting power.  That's assuming the 31DEC staking whale is one entity, but it could very well be multiple.

This is a really interesting idea and I think your argument about decision making capabilities not being linear to wealth is valid.  I would also guess there to be a diminishing return on commitment and interest in governance as a person's ICP staked amount increases.

This is something to keep in mind as we move forward with the NNS.  The inclusion of governance following and default options for Cycle DAO and ICPMN should help resolve this issue, but some of the data from the NNS suggests that the community should be thinking about decentralization.  For example, of the 400M voting power, here's how it's broken down:

* 146M for seed round investors (side note - seed round investors have been impressive in their 8-year staking)
* 92M for unknown genesis accounts (strategic partnerships/investors, advisors, presale, dfinity employees, etc.)
* ~62M for the unknown "31DEC Staking Whale(s)"
* 52M for early round investors (a number that is decreasing since most are dissolving)
* 5M for the ICA
That leaves around 135M left for other entities, including community staking.

I think I would feel much more comfortable if/when the community staking portion of the NNS hits the 50% mark.

One final note - kudos to (a) the community for being welcoming of different perspectives, (b) @skilesare for willingness to debate, defend his position and learn from other positions and (c) @villa-straylight for coming to this forum to acknowledge and explain the Reject votes.  I hope future controversial votes are as productive as this one since it has led to a valuable community discussion.

What would be good to visualise is the direction each group's voting power is trending in relation to each other.  I think most of the seed round are dissolving right?  That voting power should be trending downwards.

I mean, to clarify - I don't consider the seed round / genesis accounts to be that different from "the community", as they were part of the Ethereum community who just happened to back a winning horse.

Exactly what I was looking for, thanks!

So one neuron can be represented by several humans (one firm, one neuron, several board members). I guess it's also correct to assume that one human can hold several of these top 169 neurons (in order to have different dissolve delays etc). Is that right? 

How did you about to find this data, if I may ask?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-01-27 14:16:13 UTC | #213

Yup, those are correct assumptions regarding the possibility of a many:many relationship between neurons and humans.

I used the API for ic.rocks to pull down the data for "known" neurons from ic.rocks.  For the 31DEC whale info, see these posts: https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/dec-31-an-analysis ;   https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/nns-post-31dec

Please go vote!  Two new NNS Governance proposals of Register Known Neuron type are live and accepting votes.  Please use your voting power to Approve the ICP Maximalist Network and cycle_dao as named Followees in the NNS dApp.

These proposals were passed as Motion proposals 2 weeks ago prior to the existence of the Known Neuron feature. These new proposals are the next logical progression toward registration of the neurons for the NNS dApp.

New Known Neuron Proposals
ICPMN: [Proposal 42010](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/42010)
cycle_dao: [Proposal 42015](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/42015)

Previous Motion Proposals
ICPMN: [Proposal 38982](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38982)
cycle_dao: [Proposal 38983](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38983)

Postmortem on [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/45842](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/45842)

A few days ago I submitted ICDevs.org in a "Known Neuron" proposal.  I stayed pretty quiet about it as I was super busy at ETHDenver and generally just happy to be helping increase the voting participation. @wpb can probably do a much better breakdown of the voting, but it looks like we had one of the most voted on proposals to date. 71M voting power!

Unfortunately, 39M of that voted to reject the proposal.  I'm not sure what the controversy is for recognizing that that neuron belongs to ICDevs, but apparently, there are still 7 neurons making up 37 million voting power that don't want the NNS to recognize the ICDevs.org neuron.

I'm trying to not be too disheartened that the procedure didn't pass as it looks like the increase in voting participation will eventually neutralize whatever this spirit of censorship is from a few individuals.  It is a bit scary to think about what could be proposed and passed at this point by just a few individuals and it should encourage everyone to keep pushing NNS participation.

I do appreciate the 32 million votes that did attempt to approve the proposal. Thanks for your participation. I know a good number of you went to extra lengths to get your votes passed.

As far as ICDevs goes, we will keep plugging away.  We have $40k-$80k of bounties about to come out and we're looking forward to collaborating with the Motoko Bootcamp in training up some new motoko devs.

You are getting closer @skilesare.  Keep doing great work for the IC community and I'm sure it will happen eventually.  You are correct that the voter turnout was very high, which is definitely heading in the right direction.  You proposal attracted a lot of participation.

Will foundation & / ICA ever vote on governance proposals such as these?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-02-28 05:07:52 UTC | #218

Good question. This may change in the future, but as far as i know the Dfinity foundation won’t vote on adding followee proposals so that the community can surface or promote its own leaders.
