# Summary
cycle_dao proposes that [cycle_dao](https://cycledao.xyz)'s neuron 5967494994762486275 and [ICDevs](https://icdevs.org)' neuron 14231996777861930328 be added to the list of optional follow targets in the NNS app.

[Edit: changed word "default" to "optional" based on request from @wpb ]

@skilesare @wang @Hazel @harrison @MattS @cryptoschindler @awrelll @evanmcfarland    

# Motivation

This proposal is raised in response to the [Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights (Proposal)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172) which will result in the disabling of default following for the "Governance" NNS proposal topic. This is a positive step toward decentralising IC governance away from DFINITY. However, it is unreasonable to expect NNS voters to find and enter the neuron IDs of credible independent followees. 
This proposal will simplify this process.

# Background
The proposal is identical to @diegop's [ NNS Motion proposal 28713](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/retrospective-on-nns-motion-proposal-28713/8490) with the addition of ICDevs' neuron.


Information on cycle_dao and it's governance philosophy can be found here:
[cycle_dao Governance & Ecosystem Perspective](https://cycledao.xyz/posts/cycle_dao-governance-and-ecosystem-perspective)

# What We Are Asking the Community & DFINITY Foundation
1. Please read, share and comment 
2. Consider adding the contents of this proposal to the "Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights" proposal
3. Coordinate submission of the "Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights" proposal to simplify voting on these complementary proposals to a single instance of work.

Thank you for providing this write-up Arthur. I’m a big supporter of Cycle_DAO and I hope to see this proposal approved.

I’m also a big fan of ICDevs and their mission. @skilesare will you be updating this post with a write-up on your organization’s governance philosophy?

Thanks all

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-06 12:08:13 UTC | #3

@skilesare @Arthur would it be possible to list who your current members are and if they all have equal voting rights at this time? 

Sorry for multiple posts just trying to think of meaningful questions.

-------------------------

Manu | 2021-12-06 12:57:20 UTC | #4

Great initiative Arthur!

Perhaps it would be better to make two separate proposals instead? I think it would make sense if the proposal to add a certain neuron to the follow-targets in the NNS dapp would actually come from that neuron. I think any additional information on how you're planning to vote and whether or not you'll vote on every proposal (such that followers don't miss out on rewards) would be very helpful information.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-06 13:37:33 UTC | #5

This makes sense to me. We could easily divide this into two proposals.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-06 15:40:17 UTC | #6

Appreciate the questions.

Current voters in cycle_dao are @wang @Hazel @harrison @MattS @cryptoschindler @awrelll @evanmcfarland  @Arthur (me)

All votes are equal. 

cycle_dao requires one vote to put a proposal forward and a second vote to adopt it.

# Governance

ICDevs is a 501c3 charity that is governed by a set of by laws.  We have [board](https://icdevs.org/board.html) that oversees the organization and I have been elected by the board to be the executive director.  I oversee all the day to day operations.

The board has also authorized me to establish a Developer Advisory Committee.  That board has two levels.  There is a Developer Advisory Board level who's job it is to set the policy for 1) The use of our community fund and 2) to make proposals on how we should vote on NNS proposals. Once a recommendation has been made, the idea is to submit the propsal to a broader group of developers that have signed up to be a Developer Advisor. You can read more about this group and see the list of publicly available members at https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html .  

The original goal was to use Axon for these votes, and we did that a couple of times, but apparently that ends up actually creating an NNS proposal and we ended up being penalized a couple of ICP for the privilege of learning how the tech works.  As a result we have an open bounty where we are seeking to fork axon and add some general purpose dao functionality.  [See the Bounty](https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html). Once we have this up and running we hope that all of our manual votes in the NNS will be driven by our committee and that our fund prioritization will be a collaborative effort.  To be honest, for now it has been a lot of me saying "I'm going to do X unless someone objects in the 24 hours.  We've got to get that tighter, but until we have the governance platform that we can promote it is kind of hard to collect the community in one place.

Finally, because ICDevs is a 501c3 Charity and subject to [bylaws](https://icdevs.org/bylaws.html) we can't have a pure DAO and I have to maintain some kind of veto authority in case the Developer Committee wants to do something outside the bylaws.  In that case, I'm supposed to refer it to our governing board for approval, so there is still a pathway to get it done.

# Philosophy

As far as what decisions we make and what we take into consideration, we are generally a pro-developer group. So for an NNS proposal that pitted the Node operators against the Developers, you'd probably see us taking the developer's side.  Fortunately most issues aren't that divisive and you'll see us coming to a broad set of agreements with the community on advancing the feature set of the IC in a responsible and secure way.

In the longer term, and with proper funding, we hope to take on some of the oversight of important software infrastructure in the community in much the same way that the Linux foundation does today.

If you'd like a deeper dive on what we want to do I'd sugges listening to the podcast that we did with @Arthur https://soundcloud.com/arthurfalls/icdevs-the-drive-toward-community-developed-infrastructure

I'm happy to answer any questions, so fire away.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-06 15:28:51 UTC | #8

I'm no longer involved directly with cycle_dao, if you could remove me from the list of cycle_dao voters, I've also been removed from the website: https://cycledao.xyz/

I am however on the Developer Advisory Board for ICDevs.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-06 15:41:39 UTC | #9

Oh yea I forgot you left. Oh well. All the more reason to add ICDevs to the default neurons

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-06 15:47:12 UTC | #10

I've listened to your interview with @Arthur and it was very informative. My general take-away is that ICDevs wants to make IC developer life easier. This will be achieved by focusing on the development of critical system components, software libraries, and educational resources. Is that correct?

Would you say that ICDevs has a 5 year vision for the IC?

For example: Dfinity often requests developer feedback on prioritization of development efforts. Some might argue that Dfinity should focus on improving the IC's web hosting capabilities (to include DNS, CA, identity solutions, etc.) . Others might suggest that the integration of other blockchain protocols should take priority. Does ICDevs have a general idea for how the IC should look in 5 years?

-------------------------

cnr | 2021-12-06 21:15:52 UTC | #11

Nice post, Arthur. 

Added cycle_dao to my followees (why aren't they just called follows?). Great work on that blog post. The two things that most convinced me to follow were your "no" votes on:
1. [NNS Proposal: People Parties](https://cycledao.xyz/posts/nns-proposal-people-parties)
2. [NNS Proposal: Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters](https://cycledao.xyz/posts/nns-proposal-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters)

(By the way, might be nice if your posts included the position you took in the headline) 

---

Defaults are powerful things. 

For now, I believe the DFINITY Foundation has wielded their influence well. For example, their frequent strategy of following the community essentially means that uninformed voters just support the people that are informing themselves. For that reason I still follow them, and think they're a good default follow. 

I want to support adding additional defaults, but two things concern me: 
1. UX
2. Power superlinearity 

### 1. UX 
The UX concern is simple: getting up and running with NNS is already a very involved, ambiguous, and worry-inducing process for new users. Ambiguity kills user confidence. 

The UX we want to offer is this: 
1. User learns about ICP, buys some. 
2. User learns they should be staking their ICP for voting control and for rewards, invests time into learning how the internet identity and the nns works
3. In the NNS, user learns how to navigate and stakes their ICP to starts earning rewards
4. User learns that they're following Internet Computer Association (ICA) or DFINITY Foundation (DF) by default and so they go hunting to see who they would prefer to follow and thereby invest in the community and governance conversations. 

This creates the incremental trust-building user flow that we've all experienced, it's what got us here. The learning curve for the internet computer is steep, this Learn -> Invest -> Learn loop makes it a bit easier. Each step in the above is a completion of the Learn -> Invest loop. 

I don't see much benefit at the moment to moving the selection of followees from the fourth learn -> invest loop back to the third. 

I can see a UX cost, which is that as more neurons are available by default to choose from, users could feel like it's too much work to finish up the staking step. 

---

### 2. Power superlinearity
Even solving for UX, changing the default away from Internet Computer Association still leaves us with a problem: power superlinearity. Let's tell a story, but now I'm adding a malicious neuron into this proposal named "DFINITY Team", which is run by me and just trying to accrue power: 
1. User goes to NNS to stake ICP, they see they need to select a neuron to follow
2. User is presented with cycle_dao, icdevs, DFINITY Team (my malicious neuron), ICA, and DF. They might select semi randomly, but they'll likely favoring DF, DFINITY Team, or ICA due to name recognition. Otherwise, they'll delay selecting a neuron due to their concern about choosing poorly. 
3. My malicious neuron, DFINITY Team, steadily gets more voting power from non-vigilant users which I can do whatever I want with, because the users aren't paying attention. For example, given sufficient time perhaps I could introduce a motion to kick DF, ICA, cycle_dao, or icdevs out of the defaults. 

This is a concerningly plausible story that just comes from the power of defaults and name recognition. Obviously, this isn't what you're doing. But it's possible for *someone* to do if we stick with the current flow of needing to propose neurons as default follow-target neurons. 

---

I think the existing user flow is pretty good as it is. It makes sense that neurons that haven't *intentionally* selected a followee should just follow the community's vote. However, there's still an opportunity here:

**What we could do is make it easier for a user to discover the neurons they would prefer to follow.** This would make completing that 4th learn -> invest loop easier. 

I just found out about cycle_dao through this post, excited to have found it! What other methods might there be to set up a [credibly neutral](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) mechanism for exposing new ICP stakers to neurons they might like to follow? 

We have a big opportunity here to design the context within which neuron followership is evaluated and earned, including the process by which neurons are selected as defaults.

Inside that context, it might be much easier for people like me to find cycle_dao in the future

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-06 22:53:49 UTC | #12

@Arthur @skilesare 
There is an important distinction between default followees and being named as a followee option in the NNS app.  I would not have a problem with either of your neurons named in the list of followee options (analogous to proposal 28713), but I do not think either organization should be default followees.  I think @diegop and @johan were intentional in their proposal to disable default followees for governance proposals and they did not recommend that ICA be replaced with any other neuron (now or in the future).  Their proposal specifically requires neuron holders to manually configure their neuron if they want to follow other neurons on governance proposals.

I would like to see you remove the word "default" from this proposal and clarify that you are only suggesting that you be named in the list of optional followees in the NNS app.  You would have the power to wield Absolute Majority with every vote you cast if you are the default followee.  I don't think that is what you are suggesting with this proposal, which is why it is important to clarify.

Also, will you please add information about when you plan to submit this proposal to the NNS so we will know when it is time to go vote.

-------------------------

cnr | 2021-12-06 23:00:07 UTC | #13

I think "default follow-target neurons" does a pretty good job. But "default follow-option neurons" might be clearer.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-07 08:43:13 UTC | #14

In the future, we will include the decision in the title. The reason it is in the conclusion now is that when people read the title alone they can miss the nuance of the discussion. You aren't the first to ask, however.

**I have been slightly unclear in the description. This was intended to add new options to the followee list because default following will be turned off for the "governance" topic if the currently discussed governance/voting reward proposal is accepted.**

Your discussion of the Learn → Invest → Learn loop is well considered. However, that is not relevant to this proposal per-se as this aims to present options to the user. The proposal that will disable follow by default is this one [Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights (Proposal) ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172)

The malicious follow target neuron story is plausible but to me appears unrealistic. It would have to pass a community selection process to be included. The name "DFINITY Team" would not be accepted as part of a proposal to add a new neuron because it is misleading. So lets rename it "Governance Analytics" then, in our imaginary future context, users will have to select it from a range that might include ICA, DFINITY Foundation, cycle_dao, ICDevs, Governance Analytics.

We can say it will get say, 1/5th of random choice but it would be very hard to hijack voting based on credibility. The sheer amount of sustained work that has gone into establishing cycle_dao has been huge, and that is in the presence of a lot of social capital from reputable individuals. 

Not to mention, sheep clothing is always ill-fitting on a wolf. cycle_dao & others would see a long con a mile off. Finally, someone needs to be motivated to do this ie. the threat has to actually exist. Personally, I don't believe it does, but given the multiple layers of protection we have it wont be an issue if I'm wrong.

I think the process of discovering "credibly neutral" neurons is exactly what we are going through here :slight_smile:

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-07 16:29:15 UTC | #15

I'm in favor of being an option, but don't need to be a default.  I think the NNS UI does some randomization... the interesting thing about the IC is that anyone can make a UI for the NNS. I've thought about building one for ICDevs that lets people stake dedicated neurons and default follows us.  I don't have enough funding for that, but it is on the agenda.

There may be some merit it selecting 1 of X in the long run, but I think Arthur hits most of the points that are needed to talk about.

Totally agree that it is. 

I guess the point I'm making is that if we're going to add additional options to the nns dropdown, they should also come with context, like a link to a web page where the user can read about the neuron's voting goals and governance structures

Yes!

> Would you say that ICDevs has a 5 year vision for the IC?

We think that in 5 years the IC can be enterprise-ready and can onboard 10,000 developers into building web3 apps and smart contracts.  That can increase another 10x in the 5 years after that.  Doing that takes amazing tools and a broad set of IC tuned libraries.  We hope to support the building of those libraries and tools.  

On the blockchain side, we expect that in 5 years the IC will be integrated with ETH and BTC and that somewhere around 50% of the non-staked eth will be held inside of IC canisters/on-chain wallets that are running scaling infrastructure for Ethereum that moves far beyond what ETH2 will achieve.  This may extend to some of the newer chains if they manage to stick around, but the IC is going to give BTC and ETH a new lease on life and they have the network effects.

How will the IC have 50% of the non-staked ETH? That's as much or more than Ethereum itself? 
Kinda curious as to how you arrived at that estimation?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-08 01:35:43 UTC | #19

Pure speculation based on the scaling principles of the IC, the needs of ETH, and an understanding of chain key crypto.

Keep in mind that eth held by canisters will still be on the eth mainnet. These canisters will just be able to hold it and pass through the scalability of IC smart contracts. 1,000,000x cheaper gas and storage.  

Someone else could get there first, but I bet they do it with similar chain key crypto principles.

-------------------------

Maxfinity | 2021-12-08 02:42:36 UTC | #20

Ah but when you make a function call to a contract with web3, all the native integrations are based on a request and response model on the ETH network.

I'm not sure the ETH foundation would sanction changing web3 and all that infrastructure to accommodate two networks, with a response coming from Dfinity. 

Certainly a use-case perhaps for heavy-computations, with results being transmitted back on to Ethereum through events ...

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-08 19:24:30 UTC | #21

Your canister will be able to make request/response transactions on the ETH network.  You can mask it behind IC based transactions...or you can program your canister to take in signed ETH transactions and relay them to the network.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-08 20:22:59 UTC | #22

it uses normal smart contracts on Ethereum

-------------------------

Maxfinity | 2021-12-09 00:23:11 UTC | #23

Ahh I see, yeah huge in that it absolutely reduces the cost of swaps on ETH by a huge factor. Maybe the web3 integrations  not that big a deal.

-------------------------

Maxfinity | 2021-12-09 00:37:44 UTC | #24

If a Uniswap swap costs about 150,000 gas and we say an ERC20 transfer costs about (40,000 *2) then this would make the cost of transacting about half on the main chain. A significant cost-saving advantage.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 20:44:56 UTC | #25

Question for both @skilesare @Arthur and any of your fellow members if they want to chime in.

I wanted to ask if there are any types of proposals that your organization might abstain from voting on? 

Edit: Thought of a less controversial way to ask my question

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-12-09 20:42:16 UTC | #26

(Not representing Dfinity here)

I just want to add that I intend to vote accept on this proposal with my personal neurons. More leaders the better.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-09 20:58:38 UTC | #27

Copyright. :rofl:

Seriously though...I'm sure we'll find some good neurons to follow on topics that aren't relevant for us.  Throw out some examples and I'll try to clarify.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-13 03:16:33 UTC | #28

Hey @Arthur and @skilesare this is a really good suggestion made by @cnr.  I think it should be easy for users to find your respective websites, know who is voting in your organization, know your voting mechanism, know how you determine when your neuron will vote to Approve or Reject, and know your general principles that tend to influence your decisions.  Also, as pointed out by @Manu, you should make it clear to the users how you plan to make sure your neuron is a reliable followee neuron for governance proposals.  Otherwise folks could miss out on voting rewards if they are trusting liquid democracy by following your neurons.  It would be good to set this up before you make your respective proposals to add your neurons as named options in the NNS app.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-13 08:48:40 UTC | #29

Is there a way to do this with the current interface? I know they are working on a new one

-------------------------

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-15 00:33:02 UTC | #31

@Arthur and @skilesare 

Now that DF and ICA are going to be removed as default followees for governance topics (as per proposal 34485 linked below), people will start looking for neurons to follow.  I suspect cycle_dao and ICDevs are going to become more common followees for many neurons, but both of your organizations will represent special interests.  I expect people will choose to follow you because they trust you to vote reliably and in a way that is generally consistent with their beliefs.  However, there will be some proposals where people will want to have an opportunity to vote manually with their own brains.  

DF and ICA enabled this manual voting by intentionally waiting until the end of a voting period before casting their vote with the majority on roadmap proposals (before Simple Majority was enabled).  I don’t expect you to have the ability to allow this voting delay in a reliable way since you lead small organizations and will likely have trouble getting your members to cast votes at a certain time.  

Therefore, I would like to develop a proposal in which execution of liquid democracy is delayed until the end of the voting period for all governance proposals.  Hopefully it is as simple as inserting a timer in the code.  The idea is to enable your neuron to vote as soon as you want, but the automatic part for follower voting to be delayed until 90% of the minimum voting period has elapsed.  Would you support this type of proposal?  

@diegop will folks from Dfinity please offer input on this concept? I would like to know if there is any specific wording that should be used to ensure that the proposal is easily actionable based on the mechanics of liquid democracy execution.  I don’t know the nuances of how it works and don’t want to propose something that makes implementation overly complicated. I feel like this should be applied uniformly to all liquid democracy for governance proposals only.

I am open to ideas on this topic and if there is  support then I will start a new forum topic in the governance category.

(https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485)

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-15 15:59:09 UTC | #32

Yeah...I think it should work this way to give followers the maximum amount of time to vote their own mind.  I don't see any reason to have it not happen at the time of closing the vote.  This might 'swing' the vote at the very end and that might be bad for 'image' and stability purposes, Maybe 90% is fine.  How will that interact with wait for quiet?

I am not sure, I will ping NNS team (maybe @lara @dralves @jwiegley @johan have an opinion)

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-15 18:28:36 UTC | #34

I like the optionality this introduces. It does give a somewhat false read on what's going to happen once that 90% mark is reached. The majority of following neurons will continue to vote automatically, so it could easily look like a vote might fail or succeed, only to have a stampede of votes near the end of the original period. Sort of like a rubber-band that is stretched and waiting to snap. With the current scheme, the tally is more realistic as votes come in, since any following is taken into account immediately.

-------------------------

johan | 2021-12-15 18:39:31 UTC | #35

Delaying the application of following for governance proposals wouldn't be that difficult to implement and I would be happy to see a motion about this and have the neuron holders decide if the benefits outweigh the added complexity.

If you want feedback on a draft, just post it here and tag us.

In the meantime, a poor man's version of this would be to advertise a neuron or neurons that will not vote until the very end of the voting period and neuron holds that want this behaviour can follow this neuron or these neurons. Note that following is applied synchronously, i.e., when a neuron votes all followers that pass the threshold vote in the same transaction.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-15 19:53:13 UTC | #36

For the origyn governance system there is a query function that tabulates based on the current follows so one can always see how things will go as of “now.” It just runs the same logic as the finalize proposal but doesn’t execute and returns the result. It may end up being too expensive, but maybe with caching it isn’t. Perhaps this would be easy to add to the NNS?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-15 20:32:16 UTC | #37

We could easily predict what the outcome would be if all flowers follow.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-16 08:59:54 UTC | #38

I really like this idea

-------------------------

lara | 2021-12-16 09:36:22 UTC | #39

I also think that the general idea is interesting and this is especially relevant if we ever choose to give different voting rewards to those who actively vote compared to those who vote by following.

However, I think a few things would have to be considered more carefully and I see one main risk with this change.
*Let me start with what I think is the biggest risk:*
*  I think the **biggest risk** is this: currently, as soon as a majority of the voting power is in favour of a proposal, a proposal is executed. I think this is very important for **proposals that are urgent**, for example introducing fixes to bugs. Following ensures that it is often the case that this majority is reached quite quickly for important decisions. However, if we didn't apply following immediately it would be extremely hard to mobilise so many voters that we reach a majority. Thus, most of the time we would need to wait at least 90% of the initial voting period, which is 4 days, to be able to execute critical proposals. 

Due to this I think we should be extremely careful with such a change. 
I agree with @johan that a simple solution to this problem could be to promote neurons that delay their voting a bit for proposals that are not urgent.
In addition, as a neuron holder I could:
* set following for those topics where I acknowledge that decisions might need to be done quickly (e.g., for upgrading replica and NNS canister), but not set following for other proposal topics e.g., motion proposals and other decisions. 
* plan to look at the NNS frontend dapp every few days and then vote on all proposals to get my rewards. (Note that if a proposal is decided before the voting deadline because of a majority of yes/no votes, one can still vote to get rewards until the voting period is up). 
* in busy weeks / during holidays etc, activate following for all proposal topics not to miss out on rewards

In my opinion, being able to distinguish following for urgent and less urgent topics and applying this behaviour is actually one of the main advantages of having the possibility to set following based on proposal topics.

*Other things that I think should be considered:*

* The change would not be quite as simple as "inserting a timer in the code". We would need to change the voting algorithm, since as @johan mentioned, currently whenever a vote is cast for a neuron, the following is immediately triggered for all followers of that neuron. 
Any code change comes with some efforts and risk so this must be weighted against the benefits.

* It would have to be defined carefully how this impacts wait-for-quiet (I just saw @skilesare already mentioned this above and I agree). Wait-for-quiet considers how the voting result develops to make decisions on whether the voting deadline should be increased. Would this now consider the "real" result (i.e., withouth following) or would this consider the result taking into account the following that has not happened yet? Also, how should these rules be applied to the following in the end? Would we evaluate whether the result turned/the voting period should be increased for each vote that is cast or only after "the full block of all following votes" have been added?

* Smaller detail with this: how is "90% of the voting time" defined if the voting period is dynamic?

Thanks for your comments @lara.  I’d like to know a little more about your concerns, as well as actionable solutions, after providing a few clarifications below.

I’m envisioning this manual voting period to apply to Governance proposals only.  All other proposal types do not need to be delayed.  Does this address your biggest concern?

The delay timer I proposed is relative to the minimum voting period, which will now be 4 days.  This value is not intended to be changed by W4Q.  I may be using terminology that has specific meaning in the W4Q algorithm, but my intention is for the manual voting period to be fixed for every proposal.  

If the minimum voting period (previously 24 hrs; now 4 days) changes again in the future, then this delay timer should adjust proportionally.  I picked 90% somewhat arbitrarily, but it could be 80% or 60%.  I just want to give people time for manual voting before their followee(s) casts an irreversible vote for them.

I would much prefer this manual voting period to be implemented by code instead of depending on people to configure their neuron to accomplish this goal.  The former guarantees success.  The later is likely to fail to meet the objective of this idea IMHO.

I agree that waiting until the end of the minimum voting period to execute liquid democracy will impact W4Q on many proposals.  That seems like a good thing for Governance proposals.  If a lot of votes are suddenly cast, especially if they swing the outcome, isn’t that a signal that the vote really should be extended by W4Q?

Do you envision the Governance proposal type being executed by Absolute Majority in the future?  Does proposal 34485 (part a) make it unlikely for Absolute Majority to happen on Governance proposals?  I thought the purpose was to remove default following for proposals on the governance topic and that this would have an immediate impact on the ability of any neuron, including DF and ICA, to quickly and automatically executing liquid democracy to decide a vote when they cast their vote.  It seems like a logical next step toward decentralization of the IC, but it also means people will start looking for other neurons to follow automatically.  All followee choices represent special interests, which is fine, but it definitely seems like the system should be configured so people can have the opportunity to vote with their own brains first.

I’m really hoping to get suggestions on how to word this proposal in a way that makes it easy to implement programmatically.  If you, @johan, @jwiegley, or @dralves have any suggestions then that would be appreciated.  My preference is for the proposal to include specific, actionable deliverables, yet still enable creative and robust solutions that are relatively easy to implement.

Thanks for the clarifications and apologies for having misunderstood the proposal: re-reading your question I now see that it was clearly saying "governance proposals". I think I was reading this as "proposals in the governance canister" rather than "proposals of *topic* governance", this was totally my fault.

> Does this address your biggest concern?

**You are absolutely right, this eliminates my main concern!**

> If the minimum voting period (previously 24 hrs; now 4 days) changes again in the future, then this delay timer should adjust proportionally

It makes sense to me to apply this relative ot the minimum voting period. This minimum voting period is actually just a constant in the code, so it should be easy to express this relative to it and ensure that it would automatically be "adjusted" if we ever change the minimum voting period again.

One note on implementation: currently the process how votes are processed is independent of the proposal's topic, i.e., when a vote is cast following is also triggered. If we now changed this behaviour for proposals of topic governance only, this would mean that vots are processed differently depending on proposal topics. I think this can be implemented by an extra check. I just want to point out that this makes the logic of how proposals are processed a bit more involved, which for example might make it harder to argue about and prove security properties. (Just another thing to consider in weighting the pros and cons).

> If a lot of votes are suddenly cast, especially if they swing the outcome, isn’t that a signal that the vote really should be extended by W4Q?
Right, I think this could be a valid argument.

I guess I was wondering about the following scenario: Say there are many, close to 3%, yes votes and only one no-vote. However, the no-vote is coming from a neuron that has extremely many followers, so many that all the follower's votes would add up to 50% of voting power. Now, should we view the actual result 3% yes + 1 vote no as the "trend" or the 3% yes + 50% no (that we know will take effect before the voting period ends) as the "trend"? 
One could argue that everyone who knows the algorithm would know that the expected outcome is a *no* already. This could for example mean that if I want to vote no and follow this one neuron, I might abstain because I know my opinion will be reflected correctly. Therefore, when all the no-votes are then cast by the following that kicks in, we could consider that this is not really a "change in trend" as this was predictable. For this reason, one might argue that the voting time need not be increased in this moment. 
What I mean is that we mainly want to increase the voting time to give people chances to react to new trends that might be surprising, but in that case the change in trend was predictable. 
Therefore, I think it is a valid option to consider the trend with or without taking the following (even though not applied yet) into account.
Do you know what I mean? Do you think in this scenario only the effective current result should be considered as the "trend"? 


> Do you envision the Governance proposal type being executed by Absolute Majority in the future?

You are right. I don't think proposals of topic governance are emergency proposals and rely on the fact taht they can be executed quickly with an absolute majority.
Of course it can still be that some of the future proposals will achieve the majority threshold, but I agree that this will be less likely and we don't rely on this.

[/quote]
It seems that Governance proposals should be processed differently.  Providing an opportunity for manual voting is one reason, but there seems to be other reasons that are being identified in other threads on the forum.  For example, a lot of folks are talking about voting thresholds.  I suppose if you start processing Governance proposals differently that other proposal types, then you can plan in advance for other types of changes that may come up for the Governance topic.

[/quote]
You provided a good example for why it is important to define the "trend".  I don't think I have a strong opinion one way or the other at this time.  I would probably prefer the side that is more conservative...meaning whatever enables people the best chance of casting votes in the long term best interest of the IC.  I think you and your colleagues at Dfinity have been thinking about these voting mechanisms longer than anyone, so I would look for your guidance on the best definition of "trend".  

I really like the idea of displaying Current Results and Projected Results in the NNS app and on the dashboard.  Current Results cannot be changed because votes have already been cast.  Projected Results will change as more people and organizations cast votes.  Hence, people can see the direction the vote is heading in real time...it will help them decide if they need to cast their manual vote to increase the probability of achieving their desired outcome.  This seems like very important data that should be readily available.

With the feedback provided so far, I will develop a proposal and post it tomorrow as a new governance topic in the forum to begin deliberation.  Some time next week I will submit the proposal to the NNS for voting.  Thank you @arthur @skilesare @lara @johan @jwiegley @dralves @diegop for offering input.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-17 02:42:05 UTC | #43

I only see one tricky thing about implementing your feature idea as stated: we don't have "timers" in Governance, so there's no way to say that something should happen once we reach a specific time threshold. What we do have is a canister method, invoked by a cron job, that acts as a heartbeat for the progression of proposals and the allocation of rewards.

If we attach your idea as another feature of the heartbeat, then we could aim for 75%-ish by invoking it on the 3rd day after the proposal begins.

This then happens in a governance function called `run_periodic_tasks`. The implementation would involve adding a call to a function here that loops through the open proposals, loops through the ballots of each proposal, and checks whether there are neurons that haven't voted but whose followees have voted. This would necessitate building a followee graph -- something we don't currently have. Building that would be best done with a graph library (`petgraph`?) which could quickly identify all the "edges" representing votes that need to be auto-cast.

Not difficult, but not trivial either. Might involve a new library dependency to build the graph, so we'd have to monitor the increase in canister code, or hand-roll just the graph handling functions we need if we want to keep it really small.

@lara @johan @jwiegley @dralves @diegop @Arthur @skilesare 
As I was trying to write out a proposal to pitch as a new topic in the governance category, I realized that I want to go through one more round of feedback from you here first.  It's a proposal shaped from the ideas that you all have presented in this thread.  What do you think?  Do you see any technical difficulties?  Does it still meet the design intent of the voting mechanisms with minimal changes?  A proposal framed in this way would redefine Current Voting Result and would introduce a new calculation of Projected Voting Result.  

Proposal

1) Do not execute Follower votes immediately...only include votes that are cast manually in the calculation of Current Voting Result.
2) Create a new Projected Voting Result calculation that accounts for all manually cast votes and all Follower votes that result from liquid democracy.
3) In the Wait for Quiet algorithm, define the "trend" and make algorithmic decisions based on the Projected Voting Result.
4) At the conclusion of the voting period, execute Follower votes.  Afterward, the Current Voting Result will match the Projected Voting Result.
5) In the NNS app and on dashboard.dfinity.org, display both Current Voting Result and Projected Voting Result

Explanation

This proposal has several implications that I think are desirable, but I'm interested in your feedback.  

Current Voting Result will be based on votes that have been cast manually and are not reversible.  Projected Voting Result will be a calculation of the result if all Follower votes were cast based on their Followee assignments.  By definition, Projected Voting Result will change every time a vote is cast manually.  This voting mechanism would force all proposals to be finalized within the 4 to 8 day window of the Wait for Quiet algorithm even if the Projected Voting Result is an Absolute Majority.

When I use the term voting period, I am referring to the total time it takes to execute a proposal vote (inclusive of the Wait for Quiet algorithm) according to the current methodology for how the voting duration is determined.  This means the voting period will be anywhere from 4 days to 8 days.

Voters can see the trend of the Projected Voting Results and decide for themselves if they want to cast their vote manually.  They will be able to cast their vote manually at any time throughout the entire proposal including after the Wait for Quiet algorithm extends the voting period.

Voters who are not following any other neurons who have voted can still vote at any time throughout the entire voting period.

Neurons that are configured as Followees for other neurons can cast their vote at any time throughout the entire voting period and it will not prevent individual voters from casting their votes manually.

Simple Majority and Absolute Majority will still execute automatically according to Current Voting Results, but Wait for Quiet is based on Projected Voting Result.  This ensures that Absolute Majority is only decided prior to the end of the voting period by manual voting instead of liquid democracy.  This also enables voters who disagree with a Projected Voting Result to cast their vote manually even if the Projected Voting Result is an Absolute Majority.  When they cast their vote manually, it will change the Projected Voting Result and may or may not change the "trend" as per the Wait for Quiet algorithm.

No new timers would be introduced and this proposal maximizes the time for which every voter can vote with their own brain on each proposal, while still ensuring that they can configure Followees when they prefer to allow others to cast their vote for them.

I'm interested in applying this change to Governance proposals, but it could be applied to other proposals as well if you want proposals to be executed consistently across all proposal types.  You could use different min/max voting periods for different types of proposals.  It works if the min / max is 1 day / 2 days or if it is 4 days / 8 days.

What do you think?  Is this feasible?  Does it cause you any concerns?

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-17 15:31:54 UTC | #45

This looks ideal. I don't know about the technical challenge of implementation but it facilitates individual voting and avoids the invisible time limit followee vote. I love it actually as I usually vote personally because I have a ton of small neurons and one large one that follows cycle_dao. cycle_dao is my fallback voter

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-17 22:12:29 UTC | #46

I don't see any technical hurdles that would prevent implementing such a proposal.

Yes, that link you referenced is where I more formally started a deliberation on this topic as a separate topic from cycle_dao and IC devs wanting to be named Followees in the NNS app.  It would be good to offer your responses in that new thread.  Thank you so much for all your consideration of this proposal.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-21 14:38:20 UTC | #51

I think the other proposal will be addressed and then we'll come back to this one.  I still think for the community it would be great to have a process for adding Neurons to the interface and ICDevs would love to be one of those.

-------------------------

Right. Thanks for this clarification. I didn't mean the other thread subsumes the full discussion but just the discussion about the proposal for waiting with following to kick in (I thought for this sub-question it makes more sense that I give my input on whatever is the latest discussion).
Sorry for being imprecise and thanks for clarifying this!

We just published the first version of a policy document for a community neuron we will be creating for the ICP Maximalist Network.  It is intended to be a neuron that people can select as a Followee.  The neuron has not been created yet, but soon it will be announced and promoted.  We will also be submitting a proposal to the NNS to get it listed as a named Followee in the NNS app similar to what cycle_dao and ICDevs will be doing soon.

Please read the policy document and let us know if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.  Our community is active in the telegram link… https://t.me/icpmaximalistnetwork

Below is the text we currently plan to submit for the ICPMN neuron proposal...

Title: Motion to Add the ICPMN Neuron to the Named Followee List in the NNS dApp
Summary: The ICP Maximalist Network (ICPMN) proposes that Dfinity Foundation shall add the ICPMN **Neuron ID 4966884161088437903** to the list of named Followee options in the NNS dApp.  The neuron shall be labeled as **ICP Maximalist Network** in the list.

The ICPMN neuron will be representative of the enthusiasts, end users, investors, developers, project leaders, Dfinity and ICA members, and other IC ecosystem contributors who participate in our community.  A primary objective will be to ensure that our neuron can be trusted to always vote on all proposals.  The neuron will be configured to follow our elected voting members on all Governance proposals and to follow Dfinity Foundation (DF) and/or Internet Computer Association (ICA) on non-Governance proposals.

Ownership and configuration of this community neuron as well as voting member expectations are described in the policy document published at https://www.ic.community/followee-neuron-for-icp-maximalist-network/

You can join the active ICP Maximalist Network community on Telegram at https://t.me/icpmaximalistnetwork

Motivation for this proposal - At ICP genesis, the NNS was configured to set ICA as the default Followee for the Governance topic for all neurons.  DF and ICA are currently the only named neurons in the list of available neurons in the NNS dApp and people configuring their neuron can easily select these neurons to follow for voting.  In an effort to accelerate decentralization of the internet computer, DF and ICA are going to be removed as default Followees for Governance topics and voting rewards will be weighted by proposal type. Hence, there will be a new need for people in the IC community to find other neurons to follow in order to continue getting paid their voting rewards.  It is desirable to have a diverse and reliable selection of Followees listed in the NNS app to make it easy for people to find Followee options.  Several organizations are responding to this challenge including cycle_dao, ICDevs, and ICP Maximalist Network, each of which represent special interests within the IC community.  It should be noted that all neuron owners are encouraged to vote manually on Governance topics that you consider to be important even if you select Followees for the Governance topic.  Manual voting is the only way to guarantee that your neuron votes according to what you believe is in the long term best interest of the internet computer.

Below is the text we currently plan to submit for ICDevs...

Title: Motion to Add the ICDevs.org Neuron to the Named Followee List in the NNS dApp
Summary: The ICP Maximalist Network (ICPMN) proposes that Dfinity Foundation shall add the ICDevs.org **Neuron ID 14231996777861930328** to the list of named Followee options in the NNS dApp.  The neuron shall be labeled as **ICDevs.org** in the list.

The ICDevs.org neuron will be representative of the application, service, and protocol developers building on the Internet Computer.  A primary objective will be to ensure that our neurons can be trusted to always vote on all proposals.  The neuron will be configured to the guidance of the ICDevs.org Developer Advisory Council on Governance proposals, with backup followings for governance issues not relative to developers. The backup following will be decided by the Developer Advisory https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html Committee. The neuron will follow Dfinity Foundation (DF) and/or Internet Computer Association (ICA) on non-Governance proposals but will reserve the right to vote on non-governance proposals that affect developers.  Voting by the Committee is subject to US 501c3 laws and restricted by the bylaws of ICDevs.org that can be found at https://icdevs.org/bylaws.html and thus the Executive Director has been granted the right and responsibility to refer issues to the ICDevs.org board if they may violate US law or the bylaws of ICDevs.org. In these rare cases, the board of ICDevs.org may choose to abstain from the vote on that issue or to ratify the vote of the Committee.

Configuration of this neuron, as well as voting member expectations, are described in the policy document published at https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html

Below is the text we currently plan to submit for cycle_dao…

Title: Motion to Add the cycle_dao Neuron to the Named Followee List in the NNS dApp
Summary: cycle_dao proposes that Dfinity Foundation shall add the cycle_dao **Neuron ID 5967494994762486275** to the list of named Followee options in the NNS dApp.  The neuron shall be labeled as **cycle_dao** in the list.

cycle_dao aims to advance the needs of the internet computer ecosystem. To understand what these needs are, cycle_dao monitors social media & the DFINITY developer forum, engages with the DFINITY Foundation, canvases different segments of the community, and conducts focus group interviews. The cycle_dao neuron follows other neurons to ensure its participation in every vote, but itself votes on all governance topics. Explanation of voting decisions can be found at https://cycledao.xyz/blog.

The cycle_dao neuron is currently controlled by 11 council members representing different interests in the Internet Computer community through Axon.ooo. A quorum of 3 members is required to execute a vote. Council membership changes periodically depending on the availability of members. Some or all members may elect to withhold their identities in the future in favor of anonymous participation.

cycle is a type of mainnet token, cycle_dao is as strange as icp's dao.  If they don't know that cycle_dao is cycledao.xyz then it will affect the choice of the follower of the rate type proposal, or like dfinityNode_dao will affect the follower of the Node admin type proposal

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-10 13:42:34 UTC | #63

Never thought of it that way, but I can see what you're saying. I would hope that anyone looking to participate in governance would do their own research about each organization before choosing to follow them.

I don't think IC_Devs is misleading. It's an organization of IC developers that focus on improving the IC developer experience.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-01-10 15:20:26 UTC | #64

I feel like the best solution at the moment is to add the neuron owner website to the target neuron to indicate the neuron's identity.  Following by name is misleading, especially for new users, and the People's Party will increase the voting weight of 1 billion virtual ICPs, which will involve a large number of web2 users in governance.  Although there are few target neurons now, there may be hundreds or thousands in the future.

-------------------------

My hope is that once the organizations are approved that it will be easy (e.g. not an NNS proposal) to get the name changed according to the wishes of the organization.  I agree with your suggestion of including a website link, so it would be nice to be able to do that by making a simple request to the NNS dApp team.

If none of the "no" voters regarding ICDevs post here to defend their view then I'm tempted to say it was an accident or UI bug that caused the no votes, and therefore resubmitting the motion at a later date would be warranted.

Hey Villa...thanks for the concern.

First of all, this library was created before the creation of ICDevs and was an experiment(and a fairly spectacular failure of an experiment at that) at using cycle sharing as a means to finance software development.

Secondly, the library and IP has been donated to ICDevs for stewardship and we are in the process of pulling it apart, especially the base library part, into a standard open source license.

Thirdly, we believe that these kinds of licenses are inevitable on the IC and we are profoundly interested in making sure that when they emerge, they have the maximum level of openness, forkability, collaboration, and useability by independent and enterprise customers(who regularly require annoying things like complying with OFAC regulations).  Further, the reality of any license enforcement is going most likely come under the jurisdiction of the NNS as we've already seen and started debating with the Mario issue.

Fourthly, the license, as proposed(and it is a version 0.1 on purpose) specifically tries to limit any control by a centralized custodian allowing unlimited forking with attribution and a configurable minority share committed to original creators(an attempt to mirror much of the NFT work going on to provide creators a share of the secondary or derivative market).  Better ideas that protect ingenuity while encouraging openness are encouraged.

I'd suggest that working against organizations like ICDevs that are seeking to establish standards that benefit and protect developers and creators above private interests will only contribute to predatory versions emerging first and establishing a beachhead that we may not be able to push back against.

I've updated the text of the license noting that the library actually has the MIT License and that this is just an example.  If someone wants to create a copy called example_lib.mo and actually do the work to pull out the license checks, integration, and license text from lib.mo I'm happy to accept a pull request.

Why not let devs experiment with various funding mechanisms and let the free market decide which ones get popular? Why should the NNS dictate what software funding mechanisms are acceptable? Isn't freedom core to crypto?

The way I see it, ICDevs is an active group that is passionate about the IC and willing to put in work to help it succeed. This is exactly what we want NNS neuron delegates to be. 

We should also want diversity of ideas among the delegates presented to NNS users, rather than only offering a narrow range of ideology.

I'm still confused why you chose to vote against this proposal. This is just a motion proposal to add ICDevs as a follow option in the NNS app. Why not share your concerns prior to the vote so we could discuss sooner?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-01-12 18:42:57 UTC | #86

Ok; no problem. Unfortunately I think all this does is just make it less convenient for people to follow them. They can still be followed by entering their Neuron ID manually. But I understand you wanted to bring attention to an issue you care about.

talkingant | 2022-01-12 19:35:04 UTC | #93

It sounds like you disagree with default follow choices to begin with. Just to be clear, the word "default" is a bit misleading. New neurons arent going to automatically follow ICDevs. Rather, they will be presented in the NNS app as an option.

The situation we are currently in is that most neurons follow Dfinity. If we want to change that, presenting different follow options in the UI seems most effective.

If you think that no follow choices should be in the UI, then people will just remain following Dfinity, IMO.

If you expect ICP holders to not be lazy and evaluate and vote on every proposal, you should go study voter participation in other DAOs. TLDR: the vast majority of holders want to delegate their vote rather than vote on everything. IMO, delegated votes are better than low voter participation.

The fact that you have a discord where you are dictating how people should vote suggests you are in favor of people delegating their votes/following.

> In our opinion nobody should have to deal with arbitrary terms and conditions when trying to better the world through open source development.

Developers who use the MIT license (like ICDevs) aren't doing it because they like terms and conditions. They are doing it to protect their code from being used in closed-source software. If you like open source, then you should be in favor of licenses that legally require open source use. If you publish code without any license, there is nothing to encourage people to keep derivative works open source.

[quote="villa-straylight, post:81, topic:9363, full:true"]
The issue is with the way the base libraries are disseminated and integrated into projects. Credit to the IC, it’s possible to open source code that can send micropayments via low level functions such as converting one type to another.

If misused however, this is rent-seeking behaviour and, well, it’s not gonna happen.
[/quote]

Villa is 100% correct here.  The inclusion of such base features in this library is a bit silly and not conducive to a base library that would be broadly useful.  

To explain how it got there and my motivations, we need to take a bit of a trip through time.  Let's go back to August.  There are basically 3 app on the IC(DSCVR, OpenChat, and the NNS).  There is almost no reference motoko.   I'm trying to figure out how I could leverage what I've learned from a DFINITY grant into working full-time on the IC.  I don't have any 700,000 ICP Neurons paying out $5.2 million dollars a year so I'm stuck thinking about things like paying actual rent and figuring out how to do that as an IC developer.  

I was also attending a good bit of conversations around the legality of NFTs and how to reconcile those with US securities laws.  Some of the advice that I'd run across pointed toward the idea of blockchain-based services being accessed via distribution licenses as opposed to tokens.  Staked Tokens == Distribution Licences which have a plethora of case law in the US. It seemed that NFTs might benefit from that treatment a well.  

I started thinking that with cycles you could abstract away the company part of SaaS companies and just give the power to developers to directly get paid for their work without having to raise money and give away a bunch of ownership.  So the ideas for the license came together but I needed a library to actually try to implement it with.  I started just pulling a bunch of things that I'd built in motoko together and slapped a name on it.  In retrospect I should have picked a much more robust "application", but I didn't have any of those lying around and I wanted to get something out there to start the discussion.

If you want to know more about my personal feelings about rent seeking behavior I've published way more on the subject than any person probably wants to read in my now 5 year old book(that needs to be updated in the most desperate way with ZK info that solves the privacy concerns inherent in the scheme I was proposing at that time):  https://skilesare.github.io/immortality/the_pattern_language/ecr_neutralization_of_economic_rent.html

I'll just add that ICDevs has no intention of publishing any code that we fund under anything other than a standard Apache, GPL, or MIT license.  If we end up offering bounties on applications that are funded by cycle share-based applications we will submit those proposals to the Developer Advisory Committee before we do so.

Thank you for bringing up your concerns with ICDevs.  You have sparked a valid and necessary discussion and I definitely respect your right to lobby for your position.  As mentioned by @LightningLad91, I am curious how you would respond to the feedback that @skilesare has provided about ICDevs.  Their path forward seems fair from my perspective, but you understand what’s at stake better than myself and I would be interested in hearing your thoughts.  I think @talkingant also makes some valid points in this discussion about the licenses, so I’m also interested in further response to those ideas. 

One part that caught me by surprise on this proposal for ICDevs is that it was announced in mid December and there were no concerns expressed by anyone prior to seeing so many large neurons vote against it.  I’m glad it has brought forth this discussion, but I’m curious why you and others waited to voice concern?  Did you simply not know about the proposal until it was live?  Or did you feel like an effective conversation could not be held until the proposal was live?

My hope is that the differences can be worked out on this topic.  I do see ICDevs actively engaging the IC community on a variety of topics that resonate with the community in a positive way.  I’m curious if you are engaged with the community in a similar way or would like to become engaged.  It’s possible I’m not familiar with your group, but if you don’t mind I would like to learn more.

[quote="villa-straylight, post:94, topic:9363, full:true"]
Yeah. Licenses are minefields for the developers. In our opinion nobody should have to deal with arbitrary terms and conditions when trying to better the world through open source development.

Whoever tries to rugpull people who are developing on the IC because of some open source code license… we will make an example of them and it will never happen again.

There are plenty of examples of freely distributable licenses, what we have seen from ICDevs is the opposite.
[/quote]

A couple of points on this:

1. Again, the ARAMAKME stuff is not an "ICDevs license".  It isn't in a state where anyone should use it without significant community discussion and at least one lawyer weighing in.

2.  I'm confused about your stance toward open-source licenses in this statement.  Are they a hindrance or are they widely available?  My experience is that you generally want to have SOME license.  Just putting NO LICENSE will dissuade anyone who has to answer to shareholders, investors, etc from using your code because of a lack of predictability.  The MIT is super permissive and short, the GNU is opinionated but they both put restrictions on code and its uses even if to just disown liability.

And this begs a couple of questions that I think are relevant:

1. Do you feel that all the licenses that should exist already exist?
2. Do you feel that the existing licenses cover new possibilities enabled by the IC that didn't exist before?

If the answer to either is "NO" then shouldn't we be having a conversation about it?  That is all ICDevs currently wants to do is to figure out what the hell to do with this pattern even if it is to declare it an anti-pattern. Further:

1. Does the existence of code that the ICDevs Executive Director wrote before ICDevs launched disqualify the entire organization from doing good in the IC ecosystem and being able to be measured in governing the IC?
2. We've changed the license and proclaimed that you are correct about base libraries. Is there some other penance we need to go through here, or can we move on and make sure that the best decisions are made about new licenses that take into account IC functionality?  I don't want Meta or Google driving this conversation.

Full disclosure here: I am a member of ICDevs. @villa-straylight your points are noted. Here's a bigger picture in my eyes.

I was floored with seeing the capabilities to send micropayment on content through IC(ok, converting one type to another). Also I am really impressed with the depth of research done by @skilesare on how to make NFTs pass the hewey test. This is true innovation. 

I do think we should be having conversations about this innovation so that it can benefit the IC community at large.

Then why are you voting against ICDevs for one member's past work on licensing, rather than on how they would govern the code of the IC?

Do you understand how open source licenses like MIT or Apache (which IC uses) protect developers from legal trolls?

> What you’re doing with the ICDevs neuron is akin to getting in early to lobby the government about a whole new industry.

Isn't this exactly what you are doing with your own neuron/discord group?

Do you understand that the IC is new, and there aren't that many companies hiring yet? Furthermore, if every new IC dev has to go work for someone else, we will attract less devs and have less innovation, compared to other blockchain ecosystems that don't have authoritarian governors like you.

 I don't think this helps. I understand the frustration but Villa has a right to vote and clearly has the trust of some number of stakeholders in his/her Discord group.

This is all part of governance.

My focus is simply on the code of the IC, I couldn’t give a damn about licensing. I don’t think it’s going to be relevant in the future, or worst case if we’re still bound by legal language, it won’t remotely resemble anything like how it works today.

Why so much emphasis on licensing and ownership of code right now in the IC’s infancy? Who cares - the code’s either going to be freely shareable or compiled into an anonymous canister.
[/quote]

I'm 100% with you "in the long run".  I've been spending the last 4 years talking to fortune 500 companies trying to explain DFINITY and the IC(while painfully waiting for release) and I've learned a lot about what CTOs will and won't endure inside their organizations.  If we ever want them to take the IC seriously it has to come with legal protections, clear guidelines, and limited volatility.  They have to know who owns what or it won't come in the corporate doors.  Now I'd imagine that you and I probably agree that in the long run we need very different kinds of organizations than corporations, but if we want them to take the poison pill that leads to their transformation we have to work within the reality of those contexts.  So if you want to build an NFT wonderland on the IC where everything is digital and de novo you can get away without licenses and not care about them.  If we want to use the IC for building roads, planning new medicines, reducing operational costs of service providers, building factories, and discovering new science we are absolutely going to need to care about licenses.

[quote="villa-straylight, post:100, topic:9363"]
If your code is good somebody’s just going to copy and paste it and change a few variable names. If it’s trash, nobody’s going to use it and trying to force it upon people by distributing base libraries is just… strange.
[/quote]

Yes! A super interesting question for the IC to grapple with.  The Mario thing bore this out and we should talk about it.  There will be a software licensing complaint against someone on the IC in the future. How will we handle it!  I don't know but the NNS has the power to take that canister off line.  Should we do that?  We have a massive post elsewhere on the forum to talk about that so I don't think we need to rehash it here, but I think you place more emphasis on the now irrelevant claim that I was trying to distribute base libraries with ransom code than on the fact that it is important that we have institutions talking about this and planning for the future.

[quote="villa-straylight, post:100, topic:9363"]
Also on the subject of economic rent, it just goes away. The IC is about removing middlemen, lowering barriers to entry. Any sort of rent-seeking just gets quickly out-competed.
[/quote]

Do you consider developers to be middlemen?  They are building the code that runs the digital widgets. Shouldn't the value of their code accrue to the authors of the code? Do we expect them to build for us and fade into the west?  My feeble first attempt at this new kind of license was to find a way to eliminate the VC and corporate infrastructure that I view as the middlemen of building software today.  Current OpenSource culture is an amazing countercultural movement against the Microsoft/Oracle/SAP IP hoarding of the 80s and 90s.  OpenSource had to be radical because it was fighting against a behemoth and it required that strategy. Does the culture change when value runs through the code?  When we have new inventions that empower developers?  It is a discussion to have.

Let them eat cake.  I think we live in different worlds then.  I'm happy to take this off-line.  The evidence points to a single anonymous individual or a couple of anonymous connected individuals working together to vote against the proposal to the tune of ~20M votes.

The reality of the math is that in the next 2 days one of the 32 300,000 ICP neurons that voted against the proposal will make enough in maturity to donate to ICDevs to procure 6 seats(a majority) on the Developer Advisory Board that has the directive to drive our agenda and could recommend that we delete the offending license from the internet.  

Further, if the individuals are that concerned about rent-seeking we'll be happy to accept the dedication of just one of those neurons so we can take the rent paid to it and distribute it to developers building on the IC and require them to only use the most open and pervasive licenses.

talkingant | 2022-01-13 16:45:15 UTC | #106

Your stated goal with voting against ICDevs was to restrict the ways developers could fund themselves (such as the license a member of ICDevs previously wrote). ICDevs have clarified they are not intending to vote in any way with regard to that license, but you still hold it against them. Thus, you are trying to using your wealth and power to restrict how developers fundraise on the IC. That is antithetical to the libertarian ethos of crypto.

-------------------------

Your first reply that explained your vote said:

> We believe that this is contrary to the whole point of the IC and will vote against ICDevs until the middleware ransom code is removed and an alternative funding mechanism (perhaps none at all) is found.

Nowhere did you mention trust. Now you are moving the goalpost. 

If it is trust that is the issue, can you explain why you don't trust them and offer them a path to gain your trust?

Also once again I have no affiliation with ICDevs or it's members. I do not know them in real life. I am judging them solely based on their activity in the community.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-01-13 18:06:41 UTC | #110

This, I think, is a fair critique. 

The trust factor that you alluded to in one of the previous posts is, then, directly attributable to the fact that you feel that ICDevs is getting too much recognition for too less of innovation.

This statement is a significant misrepresentation of our work so far. We have not repackaged any rust code. We have not even released a rust library. None of the bounties that have been completed contain any rent-seeking code. Our bounty sizes are restricted by the donations we receive. Many of our devs who have applied see these as significant incentives for the work and an amazing opportunity to learn while getting paid. Finally, we have no licensing plan for code produced from our bounties except the most permissive open source licenses(likely MIT). In instances where we have a funded bounty or community requested bounty that requires work in software with a more restrictive license we will ask for the blessing of the Developer Advisory Board before doing so.

As far as trustworthiness and transparency goes, we’ve done everything up to and including submitting ourselves to the inspection of the US government as a 501c3 charity with public bylaws, clear formation documents, and a commitment to public discourse(our developer board discussion channel is public readable).  We will keep working to advance the mission in our by laws and you will have no issue with our Dedication to the cause. Our efficacy is only limited by the donations we receive.

'@quint has written probably >50% of the useful user generated motoko code in existence and @lastmjs’s contributions with porting databases to the IC and building a JavaScript cdk are by far some of the most significant innovations I’ve seen to date.'

Have no reason to take issue with that, but perhaps that is part of the 'issue'. My feels are that the 'powers that be' want  community members to develop a larger ecosystem to support beginning and intermediate developers b4 they deem same to have made a contribution that evokes trust? 

If it is just a small tribe that wants a big say based on the fact that they currently have the technical 'knowledge' ...I do understand why that might not be trusted. Nothing personal. Seems fairly pratical. 

Why aren't there numerous educational resources to learn Motoko/Candid? If there had been an early investment towards that the coin would probably be several times more valued. If a group dedicated themselves to developing this and it brought a general audience into the ecosystem my feels are that this group would probably receive the 'political' support of the 'powers that be'.

I own a domain, theinternetcomputer.org. Would be happy to contribute that to the community to build an ethereum.org -like platform and maybe the folks that make the most worthwhile contributions could use that as a platform to gain trust.  

Just sayin'. 

I have no axe to grind nor dragon to slay and no ego to serve, but I do believe in the promise of the Internet Computer to empower individuals.

For folks that have never started their own company or made the money they want to in this world I understand that pro bono work for the greater good might generate skepticism. Am sure there will be plenty of fame and fortune to go around eventually. I just want to bring a 1000 ...10,000 fresh faces through the door from all walks of life by making this more accessible.

Would also think that this would serve your desire to be recognized and rewarded with support from the 'powers that be'.

This is an interesting question! Work on motoko continued at a good club behind a bit of a curtain right up until May when the IC launched. I know I had a bit of an expectation of more robust base libraries being available. It is still really hard to do some basic things in motoko. It was part of the drive to create an org like ICDevs.

It seems a bit of a chicken or egg problem. In a young community who gets the trust and how do you build it? On the IC, today it seems that is right place right time + disposable income. You have to start somewhere, but to claim that the “trust” up and down the line on the NNS is based on something but financial ability + luck would be a hard case to make. That is the trustless nature of the system. The community can trust that these folks behind the curtain have the systems best interests at heart because they are locked up for 8 years.  It doesn’t mean they are right or will make the right choice and the liquid democracy component is there to diffuse some of that responsibility responsibly by delegating votes to experts. I’d argue that one of the axis of expertise that people would want available to them is technical expertise.

Seems like this "discord" group is a more centralized component of ICP that has massive voting power. Let me ask you How ICMPN and CycleDAO are more decentralized entities than IC Devs? Not seeking rent? that's the only parameter?

I doubt if cultural issues were at the heart of the 'no' votes by villa-straylight's group of whales, but since the American focus of IC Devs was mentioned at one point, I am placing on record my own feeling of uneasiness with regard to IC Devs as opposed to CycleDAO. When I look at the CycleDAO website, I see a group fairly diverse in nationality, who have boosted the ICP ecosystem as individuals and have come together to help it as a collective. When I do the same for IC Devs, I see a website filled with requests for donations, donations, donations, and a meagre list of bounties handed out. It doesn't convey the feeling of an organisation that has done much for the ecosystem. This kind of website for a non-profit might be something that Americans are used to and consider appropriate, but it did put me off considerably. If the response is that IC Devs hasn't done much yet but has great plans for the future, I think it is appropriate to wait till a few of those plans fructify before giving it such substantial voting power.
