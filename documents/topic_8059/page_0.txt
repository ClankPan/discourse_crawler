Hello.

I recently read a (now outdated) medium article published Mar 21, 2017 titled: "*Future Governance? Integrating Traditional AI Technology Into the Blockchain Nervous System*".

Points I wanted to highlight:
-"This is an *omnipotent* hybrid AI system that rejects or approves and then executes proposals"
-"In the earlier article I covered the basic mechanisms of the system but did not explore how we might extend the system by incorporating traditional AI techniques."

This article was written 4 years ago, so I definitely understand much has changed since then. 

The purpose of this post, is to understand what kind of AI is involved with the NNS governance today (if any)? Thanks

Good question!

I can confirm there is no AI involved in the NNS, and none slated for the foreseeable future. The priority is decentralization, transparency, clarity over more automated decision-making.
