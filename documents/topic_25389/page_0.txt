**CoinMarketCap requires payment for all non-EVM integrations.**

I also wonder if we can propose this as an NNS proposal. It's quite embarrassing that this hasn't been addressed already, especially since it places all projects on the ICP at a disadvantage.

Mass adoption will remain elusive if $ICP projects aren't featured on crypto analytics sites; this urgently needs to be addressed. It's also disheartening to see the low number of views on Dfinity's YouTube channel, where numerous high-quality educational videos are posted. This lack of interest is likely due to $ICP's limited presence.

This situation somewhat reminds me of when Cardano was hesitant to spend 3 million for native USDC integration, a step that @Dfinity should consider as well.

Totally agree with you. Technology is good, but please don't "only technology".

The unranked ones can become the best buys once they get ranked, so it's something to look forward to.

I have been shouting this for a very long term but many are not taking it serious. How about ICRC-1 token standard getting visible on dextools and Dexscreener
