Going out on a limb here, has anyone created an excel and/or google sheet function to convert a principal to the default account id?

Example code is here if there are any spreadsheet wizards out there.

In the meantime thereâ€™s a tool to bulk convert principals to account ids here: [https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/docs/](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/docs/)

I use this all the time :) 

I also need to add 'Get Airdrop Account IDs' to the Members tool on DSCVR
