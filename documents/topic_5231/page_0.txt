pretty sure that i along with others have contributed to this account in error working thru the quick-start .
i have been practicing  'click-bait' titles.  not here of course. :wink:

so after painstakingly scratching my way thru the hello quickstart i have a couple thoughts..

i mistakenly ran the code example sample at least twice...   oops!
dfx ledger --network ic create-canister tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe --amount .25

or i could be completely wrong 
most likely

i saw a tx there that was for 100_000_000 ICP. :) :star_struck:
