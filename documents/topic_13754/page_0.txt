I need to do this via management canister install_code function. 
I am able to upload a backend wasm on a canister by calling management canister. 

I am not sure how the frontend can be installed ?
I see frontend creates two wasm files one with name <project>storage.wasm and the other is <project>.wasm
Also there exists asset forlder. 

What dfx does when installing frontend code to canister, how this can be achieved via management canister interface ?

I recommend you look at the file setup created by `dfx new`. It should answer quite a few questions already.

Dfx uses the [asset canister](https://github.com/dfinity/certified-assets) to provide the frontend. It first uploads the _generic_ asset canister using the management function [install_code](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-install_code), which has been pre-compiled. Then, it uploads the frontend assets to the asset canister. This step happens through normal update calls and cannot happen via management canister calls. Otherwise the assets would have to be hard-coded and compiled into the asset canister.

@Severin Where can I find the dfinity hosted wasm of asset canister ?

I don't think there is a proper hosted wasm. AFAIK we always build it manually (build script [here](https://github.com/dfinity/certified-assets/blob/main/build.sh)) when we update it in dfx. If you want an ugly hack version of a hosted asset canister (please don't), you can download the latest version that's bundled with dfx from the dfx repo here: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/distributed/assetstorage.wasm

What's wrong with it. I started to use that `assetstorage.wasm`. What do you do wrong?

It's pointing to a place where the wasm just happens to be. It's possible that the file gets moved, renamed (e.g. to `assetstorage.wasm.gz`) or that it's interface changes without any warning. And it's more likely to contain bugs than offical release versions.

If you're fine with that risk, then go ahead, but I can't in good conscience recommend it with a blanket statement
