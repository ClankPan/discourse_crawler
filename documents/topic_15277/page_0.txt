### Introducing Civol

Civol is the world's first asynchronous video forum, a decentralized town hall running on the Internet Computer offering discourse, debate, consensus, and collective decision making for communties of all shapes and sizes. 

As a generalized, infinitely scalable governance service, Civol's mission is to enable any community to virtually assemble, discuss the issues they face collectively, and decide what they want to do about them.

### Architecture

Civol is a mobile first dapp with a Flutter frontend and a Motoko backend. Funded by 75k in grants from the DFINITY Foundation, we're now wrapping up our MVP/Alpha. Here's Civol's current architecture. 
![Civol Architecture - Alpha + Network|463x500](upload://r8LQUbsupyhu5dL2pWgMFJLNjC2.png)
The Civol experience, which we refer to as *discourse*, is based on a new unit of media called the *xchange* (a group of video posts by a group of speakers). Xchanges take place on threads, which are themselves the operative elements of every discourse. Below we see the Player on the left and the Recorder on the right. THE INTERNET COMPUTER is the discourse, and NNS : Participation and Decentralization is the thread. So a Civol instance is a set of discourses the community is currently focusing on, plus those they have focused on in the past.

![Civol XPR|545x500, 75%](upload://k0FIQIjfYgyvMVV5DRdQSBBjxoS.jpeg)

The Civol MVP will allow panelists to record video discourse asynchronously, and community members to play those videos and vote their level of resonance with the speakers. We call this *ambient voting* because it's built into the media consumption flow. Almost effortless yet meaningfully engaging, it requires just a few seconds and will soon be rewarded with CVL tokens. 

### Community Nervous System

For the Internet Computer Community it's possible that a slightly customized version of Civol could serve as a new layer of governance on top of the Network Nervous System, a Community Nervous System that decentralizes decision making, fuels participation, educates token holders, and unites the Community behind solution proposals. 

![NNS + IC.Civol CNS|690x486](upload://2CMJMYN4HD1Wfy9VTtJ03alKHT.png)

Once a consensus has been reached on the Civol CNS the proposal can then move to the NNS for what effectively becomes ratification, a final check and approval before implementation. Surprisingly, what emerges from this process is the tried and true *bicameral* pattern of governance wherein two separate legislative houses, upper and lower, represent different stakeholders.

### Context

Expert contributors and avid readers of this forum understand the governance predicament all too well. Blockchains and the dapps that run on them have had a governance problem from the outset. One of their chief superpowers being decentralization, it implies that their user and developer communities should be involved in the governance of the chain, but this has been difficult to achieve. Variations on proof of stake coupled with text-based proposal/voting systems have tended to produce centralized plutocracies of ruling whales combined with apathetic token holders who feel their participation in governance simply isn't worth the effort. 

That said, most web3 blockchain developers are valiantly seeking the holy grail of true decentralization. They sincerely want token holders to be meaningfully involved, but it seems nothing will motivate them to vote at the levels needed for true decentralization. The futility is disheartening, and it's tempting to conclude that token holders will *never* make the effort to get educated and vote. They're only interested in windfalls, which means we'll just have to accept the fact that decentralization is fundamentally limited and can only be maximized within those limits by clever incentivization mechanisms. 

I think we can do better, and the first step is to redine the problem. **It may sound odd, but I believe the root of all of this is text.** Forums, messages, articles, docs, text-based proposal/voting systems... For the average token holder it feels like doing your taxes. It feels like work, and so the user's stake has to be pretty high to justify the necessary effort and time. 

Token holders do want to be educated though. Most are willing to read and research, at least a bit, but what they really need is something they can passively absorb. That doesn't mean more YouTube analysts broadcasting opinions on competing tokens and projects based on the same basic information. *Token holders need something more like a TV news talk show, but interactive. They need to be able to **watch the stars of the show in action, the expert devs and execs and investors** talking to each other, sometimes debating passionately, on their screens.* 

It's going to take living faces engaged in spirited deliberation and debate to make people **care** about the relatively esoteric subject matter of most IC proposals. And it would be even better if they had the ability to feed back on the words they're hearing from the experts on screen, especially in a way that can be aggregated into a meaningful metric on what the entire community thinks. Civol can do all these things.

### Conflict Resolution

Every community experiences conflict surrounding the issues of its day, but because conflict is dangerous to group cohesion, especially when it doesn't get resolved, such contentious subjects typically become submerged and willfully ignored. It's the narrative control problem, and it often leads to the marginalization of dissenting voices. *The problem is not the people or the issues they're dealing with, the problem is the lack of a conflict resolution mechanism.* 

The compromises we all make instinctively to sustain community harmony and morale are so deeply rooted that the emergence of a true conflict resolution mechanism has the ability to completely reverse polarity on the narrative control problem. Suddenly, conflict can be seen as a good thing, and for more than one reason. It is precisely this community conflict that will produce not just the healing consensus so desperately needed, but also the inherent drama that will draw community members into the discourse. 

Again, small token holders do want to learn, they believe in the Internet Computer vision, but they are averse to the tedium of technical reading. This means they are going to learn much more, much better, much faster if they're simultaneously *entertained* while they learn. And this is precisely what Civol delivers — *story, drama, debate, faces, emotion, reason, meaning, engagement*. 

**A good example is the Psychedelic Town Hall.** Major respect to Harrison and the other speakers for having the courage to give voice publicly to a number of issues IC Community devs have with the Foundation. This is exactly the kind of conflict I'm talking about, and exactly the kind of drama — totally authentic, totally real, totally relevant. To thrive and fulfill its destiny the IC must become stronger, its Community demonstrating more collective intelligence, unified in principle and action. Civol can help make this a reality. There is a consensus trapped in every issue raised at the second PTH, and as they emerge through Civol discourse the Community will indeed grow visibly stronger. 

### Proposals

All this leads to my initial proposal, a *governance experiment* we're calling **The Internet Computer Town Hall**. It will bring top Community devs together with key members of the DFINITY team and the wider Community to discourse and come to consensus on proposed solutions to two or three of the PTH02 issues. 

We'll also be gauging Civol's product market fit during this time. If the fit proves good I would then further propose that Civol be developed and deployed more formally as a new governance layer for the IC, a Community Nervous System designed to work with NNS, all SNSs, and all DAOs alike. 

In sum, I'm proposing that we *experiment with Civol to build consensus for Civol as a CNS for the IC*. If and when this consensus exceeds a certain threshold (which we will decide upon collectively, using Civol) we'll submit the formal proposal that embodies our consensus to the NNS for ratification and implementation. 

In the next few days I will update this post with a link where you can install the Civol MVP from your app store of choice and thereby access The Internet Computer Town Hall experiment. You'll also find some additional writing about Civol there and be able to preview the Civol web dapp. 

Until then, I'm really looking forward to answering any questions you might have here on the DFINITY Forum, thanks so much for reading and considering!

Like I have goosebumps. I feel everyone has read my mind before I even had these thoughts. This has happened so many times since entering space. I'll read something, and I'll start going on rants like we could do this, this, or that, to solve these issues, then poof community members hit me with, "we are actively working on it", like dang guess we are on more of the same page than I keep thinking.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform is dialing up the pressure on federal agencies and crypto exchanges to protect Americans from fraudsters.

While this is aimed at Crypto Exchanges, do we also have a responsibility?

I feel we have already baked this in for future spammers and made it easier for them.

Once the spammers had to get funding to add spam proposals on the NNS to pay for a rejected proposal but now they can add their name to the “following” list on the NNS and this guarantees they will be successful as you have only one option and that’s to follow which guarantees no cost or rejection and rewards.

Total agree with @civolian:

> Web3 blockchain developers are valiantly seeking the holy grail of true decentralization.
> 
> They sincerely want token holders to be meaningfully involved, but it seems nothing will motivate them to vote at the levels needed for true decentralization. The futility is disheartening, and it’s tempting to conclude that token holders will never make the effort to get educated and vote. They’re only interested in windfalls, which means we’ll just have to accept the fact that decentralization is fundamentally limited and can only be maximized within those limits by clever incentivization mechanisms.

If the followers list was decentralized then you would be able to follow by two choices, for or against.

Now instead of going on to some outside tech to get the date and time for spam proposals to vote for rewards, which was interesting in itself as these proposals were never rejected which says a lot about the integrity of token holders.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform could view this like an organized crime event and I did not participate in it and only voted to reject it when I saw these proposals on the NNS but the numbers showed me that those spammers have celebrity status by our own neuron holders and were accepted on voting thereby the spammers also rewarded with funded coins.

Low proposal periods, I believe we could see an increase in spam activity and now it is much easier for them to stick up the NNS for extra rewards behind their neuron facemasks.

But could spammers cause an attack event oneday when they put up a proposal that causes damage to the NNS and all those following them will achieve their goals and rewards as they voted yes for the spam proposal of the past when they could have voted no and still receive rewards!

There should be a list of followers that you should only be able to follow but not spammers.

@civolian is right I have much to learn and yet you show the same power grab as many others. I go onto the NNS and see this proposal and don’t know you so I rejected you on the principle you pointed out and then I come to the forum to find the knowledge and understanding.

I believe there are many here who want a better understanding and invested in the belief there is something good here but unable to comment due to the lack of knowledge and feeling stupid by those of self interests and willing to speak against you.

Too soon and too many trust issues coupled with supporting a future mistake. How about you take your own advice and educate us first, we have seen too many commentators spruik for their benefit and seen the results and they are called pumpers and dumpers.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-05 20:54:54 UTC | #10

Thanks for your reply, @kvic, you bring up an important point that turns out to be a significant value add for Civol. That is, Civol will effectively remove the burden of proposal vetting from the NNS and shift it to the CNS. 

Once the Civol CNS is in place, the only motion/roadmap proposals that will make it to the NNS will be those generating sufficient consensus from the Community. Plus, the necessity of putting your face on your proposals (video) will deter spam from appearing even on the CNS, as will the realization that posting spurious distractions will result in a serious hit on your reputation. Spammers will be quickly voted down and out of the discourse, so their junk proposals will never make it to the NNS.

I have no opinion if Civol is potentially good or bad for Dfinity.

Will just leave this here if anyone wants to dig deeper (I haven't): https://medium.com/@wayviator/introducing-talkchain-5741024ececd

In Q118 EOS emerged as a powerful champion of Community Self Governance. There was nothing like it and hopes were soaring. They launched their mainnet a few months later having raised $4B. What could go wrong?

We launched EOS Talkchain, a Web2 version of Civol complete with on chain authentication and our ambient voting system, in Q119, despite rapidly waning support for CSG or an EOS Constitution. By Q319 all vestiges of CSG were being eliminated, including referendum. 

I wrote a final article to tell that story, [The Evolution of EOS Governance](https://medium.com/@wayviator/the-evolution-of-eos-governance-c231e8a39714), which covers everything and pleads the case for leaving the door open a crack for the return of referendum. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. 

It was a heart breaking experience to be sure, but in retrospect I'm glad. The Internet Computer allows Civol to achieve its full potential — fully on chain, infinitely scalable, tamperproof, unstoppable. I see now the IC was always the true destination for this groundbreaking governance technology, and it's turned out to be the perfect complement to the NNS.

Civol is a complete ground up rewrite of the Talkchain dapp, but I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have on its short lived EOS incarnation.

I dug a little and all I found was what @civolian explained below. That sounds like a cool idea.

matthewhammer | 2022-09-06 21:52:50 UTC | #15

I'm so glad to see this project developing @civolian.  I wish you and your team the best of luck going forward.  Also, I am looking forward to touring the code someday.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-06 22:10:20 UTC | #16

Thanks so much, @matthewhammer, you were a great inspiration! I would love to show you how the code turned out... At some point prior to beta we'll need to go through a complete audit. Not sure how that is done, would it be possible for you to be part of that or perhaps advise?

-------------------------

evanmcfarland | 2022-09-07 20:51:15 UTC | #17

This here deserves a deep read. I've been waiting for it for nearly two years, since I first heard of the concept.

If this really evolves to consensus, it will thrive on model fundamentally different to every social media we've seen.

I'll be among the first users in the hopes that this can take away the tribalism this, and really every community, is getting hung up via the otherwise toxic echo chambers we resort too. I can't thank you enough Civolian for bringing this work to its completion.

[/quote]

I hope that means lots of functional `Trie` data structures behind the scenes (and no imperative hashmaps :) ).

I'm also not sure about how your audit would best be done, but I agree it's important.

Perhaps before that "official audit", where you'd likely be paying some consultants, the Motoko/Languages team can have an informal look at the code to help spot obvious red flags, or make other suggestions.

Unfortunately, it's probably stepping out of our roles as Language Team engineers too far to do any audit with an official stamp of approval, or with any liability attached.  Though, I'd love to offer that somehow, I'm also unsure how we'd ever scale it, and balance it with other tasks, as others may also want that service too.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-07 22:41:58 UTC | #19

You were the first person I approached in the IC Community, Evan, and what an inspiration you've been the whole journey! You have such a way of capturing the essence of things...

[quote="evanmcfarland, post:17, topic:15277"]

[/quote]

Yes, but it's kind of hard to tell the truth about Civol without sounding delusional or at the very least slightly touched :sweat_smile:... 

Ok, how's this for unhinged... Soon people are going to start realizing that ubiquitous, mindblowingly accurate, massively decentralized, trustless (can you believe it?) GOVERNANCE is what comes after social, and that Web3, the Internet Computer :heart_on_fire:, is what makes it real!!

So we start with the IC itself, which is what this experiment is all about... MVP possibly tomorrow, probably Friday... Can't thank you enough, my friend!

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-07 23:53:04 UTC | #20

It absolutely does mean lots of `Trie`s! I knew our Motoko dev, Hitesh, was going to rock when I saw he had done a 20 minute YouTube on them. :smile: 

He's been truly great, but we have much to learn and so would be beyond grateful for *the Motoko/Languages team to have an informal look at the code to help spot obvious red flags and make other suggestions*. 

Totally understand about stamp of approval or liability. We've written a ton of Motoko and actually solved the storage and scalability problems for our video files, so lots of potentially good stuff to review, and we will of course be open sourcing at some point. 

Hope we can work it out, please let me know, and thanks so much for offering!

This is really fun. But I feel like you should have put in a link to a video where you delivered this message!

This cuts to the heart of why people engage in politics. Sure, they care about their wallets and about their fellow citizens. Ok. 

But they also engage because politics is the best form of entertainment around! Very excited to see where this leads.

Totally agree @dfisher, a comprehensive Loom overview is coming soon. Once the MVP is solid I'll be able to record it, hopefully this weekend :sweat_smile:!

Love that you agree on the entertainment factor, I do think it will drive Community growth, hopefully a lot, thanks!

### Civol Update

The project is facing three major obstacles at the moment:

1. **TestFlight** — Apple is experiencing an issue with the app when authenticating with Internet Identity. We cannot reproduce it and have informed them of this. We're waiting on their reply... Once they accept the app we'll get a link that will allow iOS users to install it and we can start the Experiment. :muscle:

2. **Civol Web** — We really wanted to deliver the web version with the MVP but the Civol frontend is Flutter, which means it's written in Dart and has to have its own agent to facilitate communication with the backend. There is only one such agent and it has a bug preventing us from delivering the Flutter Web version of the app. We've been informed that the developer will not be able to fix this bug, so we're going to have to do it ourselves, which means the MVP and Experiment will be mobile only until we can do that. The good news is, our frontend dev, Awaz, is beyond awesome :ninja:, so it won't be long till we can offer you a preview. 

3. **Civol Web Video** — Flutter offers mobile and web apps from a single codebase, which is one reason why we chose it. However, we're having an issue on web with the *chunking* infrastructure that works perfectly on mobile. So after we fix the bug in the agent we'll return to this issue. This is why we'll only be offering a preview of Civol Web at first, the video will take a bit longer to work out.

Bottom line, we can get started with the Experiment as soon as we resolve the issue with Apple, which we expected to happen last week. Thank you for your patience, I think you'll agree it was worth the wait. :slightly_smiling_face:

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-11 18:54:08 UTC | #30

Thanks @seb, can't wait to see you on Civol!

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-11 19:16:25 UTC | #31

Just out of curiosity what's the time line on the CNS being deployed. If this achieves the goal I feel alot of the spam proposals going around might muddy the waters a bit. I know this is only an experiment, however, I am growing personally concerned that the community is going to continue running around with temporary fixes, that make some community members disgruntled, just to then be sent to the CNS which *might* give them a fatigue feeling, or whip lash in a sense, from being thrown all over. 

Is this something we can discuss further?

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-13 17:02:03 UTC | #32

I would give the Experiment a few weeks once we get started. If successful we'll start to expand into the full CNS role.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-16 20:39:45 UTC | #33

### Civol Update

Apple has accepted Civol into the Open Beta program (there was a bug, not in Civol, but we were able to help fix it :sweat_smile:), so **we can at last proceed!** 

**Our first step** will be to bring on the *founding panelists* so they can record the first xchanges that everyone else will see when they onboard. The initial threads will be as follows, so **please dm me if you'd like to contribute** to any of them:

- NNS: Participation And Decentralization
- Does The IC Need A Constitution?
- Embracing Experimentation
- The Role Of The Foundation
- The Role Of The Community
- The Role Of The NNS
- Everything SNS
- All About DAOs
- Roadmap Governance
- Architectural Decisions
- Democracy Models

**Thanks to everyone for your patience!**

An optional new layer right?  So you'd always have the ability to submit proposals directly?

I know that doesn't deal with any potential spam issues, but some people just don't like taking videos.

There is a civic engagement website called [A Starting Point](https://homeroom.astartingpoint.com/debates), where US politicians debate and discuss political issues via short form videos. It was founded by Chris Evans and his colleagues, who did the initial interviews of the politician contributors. It's a simple platform, but it does make it easier to understand and summarize political articles that one probably would've just glanced over.

I can only imagine how much better and more powerful Civol discourses will be. :+1:

civolian | 2022-09-19 17:25:35 UTC | #39

Hi @borovan, yes optional, you'd always have the capability of submitting proposals directly to NNS. 

It's definitely true though that some people don't like recording videos, I'm one of them! :blush: However, I do find that the more I do the more comfortable I get with them, and we've got some new features coming that should help!

domwoe | 2022-09-21 09:01:46 UTC | #40

Hey @civolian,

Could you provide a bit more details on the Cache canister? Why do you need it and what is it doing?

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-21 17:52:29 UTC | #41

Hi @domwoe, the Cache canister is basically for performance. The idea is to maintain a static representation of what we call Discourse State, so that our Data canister doesn't have to process the deluge of queries we'll be getting as we scale up.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2022-09-23 13:30:32 UTC | #42

Hey @civolian,

thanks and sorry for the late reply. 

The pre-computation of static views that can be fetched with queries is a good idea. However, I wonder if it makes sense to have designated cache canisters for this. Queries are in general executed in a separate thread on the replica, so they shouldn't limit the progress of your data canister. 

Is your concern about the rate limits of Boundary Nodes? 

I wonder what @dsarlis or @free think about cache canisters.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-26 06:24:58 UTC | #43

Hi @domwoe, after going through [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/high-user-traffic-incident-retrospective-thursday-september-2-2021/6928) for a bit, yes, I'm wondering what @dsarlis and @free think about cache canisters too. In fact, I wouldn't want to implement a solution without their input, thanks for putting me onto the current state of things! We will definitely be reaching out for help here on the Forum as we move into the cache canister feature in coming weeks.

-------------------------

dsarlis | 2022-09-26 07:24:18 UTC | #44

I am not sure I can say something very specific without understanding more about your thinking here.

Caching some expensive computation so you can serve queries faster is definitely a good idea but whether you need to push that out to separate canisters or you can do it in your main data canister is another story. Dominic asked a good question. Are you worried about getting rate limited by boundary nodes if only the data canister can serve queries? Or in other words, how much load would you expect to handle in terms of queries?

It was founded by Chris Evans and his colleagues, who did the initial interviews of the politician contributors. It’s a simple platform, but it does make it easier to understand and summarize political articles that one probably would’ve just glanced over.

[A Starting Point ](https://homeroom.astartingpoint.com/debates) is a very meaningful reference, which is a very visual expression for voters, I like it.

I hope Civol can provide a similar experience. Looking forward to see your progress❤️

Thanks, @MillionMiles, yes, Civol does have a similar experience in the form of our Debate feature, which allows panelists to challenge other panelists to debate on a specific question. Key differences are that Civol Debate is spontaneous and allows the community to vote on everything the debaters say, point by point. We'll be rolling it out for the beta, so stay tuned! :slightly_smiling_face:

Thank you, @dsarlis, I so appreciate your time and perspective! Yes, worried about rate limitation in the context of maximizing performance for the user. 

The thing about Civol is, it does appear capable of scaling massively, as in millions of active users for the largest instances. For example, there might be an instance for a nation of say 100m, and they could be discoursing on multiple subjects (10-20?) of importance to them all, simultaneously... So possibly 10m+ users engaging the dapp during peak moments. Let's assume 10% of those users could be querying in those moments. That would mean 1m queries hitting the Data canister simultaneously. To reliably service a flow like that I imagine multiple Cache canisters being needed, scaling up and down in number with demand.

It's obviously going to be many months before Civol actually faces this problem (assuming people really like the experience), but possibly not that many, and it illustrates the need for a maximally scalable solution. So to me this means we need to spec out that solution and build a solid foundation v1 for it here at the outset, to the extent possible. Does that sound reasonable, and what do you think would be the best way to go about it? :thinking:

-------------------------

dsarlis | 2022-09-27 09:10:45 UTC | #48

Yeah, it sounds reasonable and I think it's very good you're already thinking through this. I agree that if you expect somewhere in the order of millions of queries concurrently, you can't hope to serve this kind of traffic from a single canister alone (even if you do caching/precomputing of results).

Having an extra layer of Cache canisters is the right direction to be looking at. I would also suggest to go about this in steps as you alluded to. E.g. you can think about the implications of such a design and possible solutions and you don't need to go all out initially but start with the right foundation. I would imagine that you can even start with a single Cache canister just to get things in place to ensure the architecture works and then scale out to more when you need. This can also give you early feedback on what works well or not.

Some things to consider when you go to a multi-canister architecture (not necessarily for your case only):
1. How would Cache canisters retrieve the data from the data canister? Could that also be a bottleneck (if all cache canisters hit the data canister)?
2. How will you manage the canisters lifecycle? What about the upgrade story? Can they be upgraded independently or will there be dependencies? (Likely you want to avoid dependencies as much as possible or in other words be able to upgrade the data canister without having to necessarily touch the cache canisters)

And probably more questions if someone starts an actual design doc and think through alternatives :)

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-28 05:48:28 UTC | #49

hi @dsarlis, thanks for confirming we're on the right track! 

Yes, how does Cache canister pull from Data? After executing all the queries and filling the Cache, we would then only re-run the queries where the underlying data had changed. And I was thinking possibly only one Cache canister would actually update periodically from Data, and then we might be able to clone it as needed? And yes, lifecycle and update (no dependencies), good points... 

I would love to have you take a look at our solution and advise if you're available. Please dm me if that might be possible sometime in the next few weeks. Thanks again!

-------------------------

dsarlis | 2022-09-28 15:23:46 UTC | #50

Sounds like it's a good idea to talk :) At least to give you some pointers on what's even possible or not. E.g. cloning the data is not something you just get for free somehow. Let me know, I'm happy to help any way I can (either reviews or simply explaining what's possible and figuring out feasibility of solutions).

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-09-28 17:17:33 UTC | #51

Thanks so much, @dsarlis, I will be in touch. We've already created a Backup canister for Data so we'll probably start there. Will undoubtedly have many questions! :slightly_smiling_face:

## Civol Update

10 people have installed the MVP but only 3 (other than Evan and me) have posted. Most of these folks are top IC devs with very little time, so I think everyone's waiting to see a few of their peers post first. So to incentivize taking this first step we've built two new features, described below. If we can get at least 10 panelists to post (hopefully 20), with a few of those being new hostposts, it should be enough content to open things up to the Community. :rocket:

### 2 New Features

**vCVL Rewards** :zap:
Voting and posting will now be rewarded with vCVL, a virtual token that will be exchanged for real CVL during our allocation event. 

* Voting — 10 vCVL per vote

* Posting
  * Hostposts — 100 vCVL
  * Consensus — 1000 vCVL
  * Founding Panelist — 1000 vCVL (5 posts minimum, 2 must be hostpost)
  * Replies — 20 vCVL

**Share (social)** :zap:
Now panelists will be able to share Xchange Link Cards on most social platforms. Just tap the Share icon button on the Player's bottom bar and you'll then be able to choose where to share and make that happen. No better way to grow an audience, I think you're going to like it. 

### 2 Remaining Obstacles

**Civol Web** — Awaz decided to explore Agent-js instead of updating Agent_Dart for Flutter Web, and it looks like it's going to work.:ninja: We should have a preview of the web version soon if all continues to go well. 

**Civol Web Video** — We have an issue on web with the *chunking* infrastructure (FFMPEG) that works perfectly well on mobile. So after we fix the remaining bugs in the agent we’ll focus on this, and it's why we’ll only be offering a preview of Civol Web at first, the video part may take a bit longer.

### Bottom line
We're looking forward to seeing some new active panelists this week as people try out our new features, and we may have a sneak preview of Civol Web by the end of the week. :muscle:

*Please DM me if you'd like to be a panelist on the issues of Constitution, Experimentation, Roadmap Governance, or some other topic!*

jsull9 | 2022-10-04 16:58:44 UTC | #53

How do we log in and post? I have been waiting to see accessible/ detailed instructions on how to access it so I can "do my part" at the very least. Would you mind sharing how/ where your application is? I can share these details on my Distrikt feed and attempt to have a few of my IC friends join the conversation to get more "peer" feedback going.

Edit: Please note* I will not "shill" your project, but as I think this *could* be a solution to spam prevention and other issues with NNS, I will share info. on how to access and use it, as I would for this forum. Only as a way to let end-users decide for themselves with little influence on their decision making.

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-10-05 01:55:57 UTC | #54

Sorry it's taking so long, @jsull9, we're still focused on recruiting our founding panelists and recording sufficient initial content. When that's done we'll open it up to the Community. Hopefully soon, we're doing everything we can, thanks for your support!

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2022-10-06 08:18:18 UTC | #55

Where can i install the MVP App? has it opened for testing?

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-10-06 20:12:03 UTC | #56

Thanks for your interest, @millionmiles! We're onboarding our founding panelists right now. After they record enough initial content we'll publish the app store links and open it up to the Community. Can't wait! :grinning:

-------------------------

civolian | 2022-10-13 16:38:38 UTC | #57

### Civol Mini Update

Hi Everyone, I was able to do a [new demo video for Civol](https://www.loom.com/share/46f13e5d2ee74a88a104139289eaa514) last week that I would really love your feedback on. 

We're also putting final touches on a couple of features that will allow us to open up the MVP to the entire Community. 

Won't be long now, thanks again for your patience!

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2022-10-17 06:04:47 UTC | #58

Amazing App! fantastic job! 

I'm very looking forward to see it public for testing.

I  believe Civol can great help NNS governance in future. 👍👍👍

Hi again everyone! I wanted to let you know that Civol is now available as a technology preview. With just a little more polish and testing we'll be able to launch it as an alpha, but right now everything seems to be working. :sweat_smile:

I also wanted to explain why I stopped posting back in October. There were two main reasons.

First, we were deciding at that particular moment to pivot to a PWA architecture to avoid app store platform risk, and this meant we wouldn't have the resources to support our mobile apps going forward, which in turn meant that, suddenly, we were no longer ready for users.

The issue was Civol's content moderation solution, which is both novel and decentralized. Given what we were seeing at the time, we realized the app stores would almost certainly reject us, and we couldn't risk that. So we had to go with a solution that couldn't be blocked. This meant the web version of Civol was going to be critical, and we were just getting started on it. 

We had chosen Flutter for the Civol frontend because the NNS dapp had recently been done in Flutter and it came highly recommended (there was a brief window where this was true and we were in it). Best thing though was Flutter's promise of a single code base. So we were just hitting MVP with the mobile version and were expecting a relatively smooth transition to Flutter Web, with maybe 10% rework. As it turned out, almost everything had to be reworked, much of it from scratch. 

The team has done a fantastic job in overcoming a literal odyssey of obstacles to get here, so now, at long last, we are beyond thrilled to reveal our technology preview, :fireworks: and we thank you so much for your patience! Again, it's a minimum viable product, minimally tested, and at the moment only recommended for laptops or desktops running Chrome or Brave. You will be its very first users!

The other main reason I stopped posting was that, as it turned out, very few people were truly interested in Civol as a Community Nervous System, despite the game changing promise. People would say they were going to post but almost no one did. Why? No one said, but the obvious truth is, [no one ever wants to be first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74AxCqOTvg) :smile:. So this was not too surprising, especially when there was no real demand for a video based governance solution in the first place. I love the IC and am beyond grateful for it, and for the help Dfinity has given Civol, so I wanted our pilot to be something that would really help the IC directly. I think we'll probably circle back to the CNS proposal once everyone has had a chance to experience what Civol can actually do for a community. Until then, we can consider this thread archived.

But about the new pilot... It's called Civol Earth, and it focuses on a new community who have been [actively searching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=903tHM4RA9k) for a decentralized globally scalable coordination solution (i.e., collective sensemaking and decisionmaking) for a couple of years now. I had no idea they were there, as what I had been calling governance for so long they refer to as *coordination*. Much better word! Their focus presently is on what is being called the [Metacrisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEP0zAK-xQ), which is what happens when all the existential issues humanity is facing (AI, BIO, NUCLEAR, etc) start to go exponential. So global issues are the focus of Civol Earth, and I'm in the process of introducing it to the Metacrisis community right now. 

Importantly, an area of strong overlap between the two communities (IC and Metacrisis) is **Crypto Regulation**, as some of the Metacrisis leaders are web3 Ethereum developers! Regulation is critical right now as disparate national approaches threaten to fragment and thereby marginalize crypto as a viable competitor to the CBDCs being rolled out by national governments. The incumbents wield massively powerful coordination solutions directly coupled to mainstream media, while the global crypto community currently has no coordination solution at all with which to make its case. Civol can serve as that solution, offering the possibility of ***decentralized global regulation*** for the first time ever, up and running on the Internet Computer. 

So please [give Civol Earth a try](https://civol.earth) IC community! To simplify onboarding here at the start we recommend what we know for sure works for our PWA, and that is Chrome or Brave on a laptop or desktop. What you'll see once you auth in via II is our grid, with 4 hostposts from me to get things started. One of those is on Decentralized Regulation for Crypto, so please jump in and reply or create your own hostpost! 

I will create a new thread here on this forum devoted to the Civol Earth pilot. We can move the discussion there. Thanks for your interest in Civol!
