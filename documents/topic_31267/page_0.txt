Hello everyone,

I am using the @nfid/embed library for authentication in my application. I now have a requirement to secure my data through signing and verifying it on the backend. I found that the method I need (ICRC-32 Sign Challenge) is available in the @nfid/identity-kit library. However, I noticed that this library is not available on npm.

I would like to use these two packages together. Can anyone provide guidance on how to achieve this? Alternatively, I am open to considering other solutions for secure data signing and verification.

Thank you in advance for your response.

Since we've begun speaking on Discord, I'll paste what you wrote me and we can continue here:
``` I need to check the validity of the delegation on the backend of the TS Node. I receive a delegation when logging into NFID or Internet Identity. But I can’t figure out how to do it correctly.

I need to check the delegation (signatures and keys) so that the Node backend can accurately understand the user ID.

I have an object after II authorization as below in the example and it should certainly be possible to verify the keys and signature.
{
… delegations: [
… … { delegation: {expiration, pubkey}, signature }
… ],
… publicKey
}
```

Am I correctly understanding you receive a delegation and want to check its principal?

I'm trying to check on the backend that the delegation is valid, at least. If we can get a payload then that would be useful

I can extract the principal from publicKey

I’m thinking of a scenario where a malicious client uses auth_client to use its pre-arranged delegation, which includes the other user’s principal, and passes it to my backend (without checking the delegation), thus gaining access to the other user’s account. How can I implement this?
