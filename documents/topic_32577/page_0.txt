Just had a quick glance at the code shared in the repo. There isn't much there yet :confused: 

Basically as far as I read the code:

- Backend: image upload canister (100 lines and no guards, user management etc)
- Frontend: uploaded image file list and a page that embeds Excalidraw

The product as presented on the marketing site seems to be far off from what's actually build right now.

You're right, I didn't linked all the repos. Main thread updated.

Find here Galaxy repos for [desktop app](https://github.com/galaxydo/galaxy-desktop-app) and [ICP app](https://github.com/galaxydo/galaxy-icp), and currently [in canisters ](https://github.com/galaxydo/june-tenth-app).

Thanks for pointing that out

hi @sea-snake creator of galaxy and contributor of excalidraw here; i am curious what kind of features would you like to integrate? what would be your use case to utilize some kind of user management mechanism, specifically?

currently, you can upload images into your personal collections within a shared canister, and you can think of any image as a resource accessible by its unique identifier in the following format:

://$canister_id/$principal_id/$collection_name/$file_name

then, you can authorize as the same principal on another device, import your collections and the images will be synchronized from the canister into your browser IndexedDB

now, think of collection not simply as a gallery of images, but also there is always a layout attached to the collection which describes how the gallery is rendered on the canvas

in this way, for example, you can upload a pdf file into a new collection, lets say a book of 400 pages, and when you switch to canvas mode, you will see a zoomed-out grid of 20x20 images extracted from the pages, giving you a complete overview of the book

back to your question, regarding user management, the canister only allows user to fetch the images uploaded by himself, and the reason behind it, as mentioned in README, that our first-milestone-app only implements Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and you can think of it as a new Obsidian;

in contrast, our second milestone (KMS) is all about multi-player collaboration, cross-linked layers transclusion, and onboardings organizations, - you can think of second-milestone-app as a new Notion;

and our third-milestone-app, as shown in the "Our Vision" diagram on the website, is called "Marketplace/Social", - and you can think of it as a new  Reddit, just with whiteboards instead of posts and galaxy-realms instead of subreddits, and if you're interested to learn more about those lmk

By the way, the map we've done about the recent news of ICP & UNDP collaboration looks cool! 

Explore it here, zoom out and move into the canvas:
[ðŸ‘‰ Galaxy example: ICP & UNDP](https://galaxy-browser.vercel.app/cali-gian/icp-undp)

This can be stored 100% on-chain. The use case here is that users and organizations can collaborate on maintaining public whiteboard maps as the most complete and verifiable truthful source of news, earning tokens from all subscribers.

Is it really worth raising so much money for this?

-------------------------

cali-gian | 2024-07-10 13:25:19 UTC | #7

Hey @hehe, thanks for asking. Our target range of $730k to $1.46M (at current ICP price) is crucial for Galaxy's success. Here's why:

1. Development: Continuous improvement, new features, security audits.
2. Marketing: Partnerships, user acquisition, community engagement.
3. User experience: Feedback loops, testing, iterations.
4. Operations: Hosting, services, tools for smooth functioning.
5. Legal: Compliance and IP protection.
6. Token management: Maintaining a healthy token economy.

This funding isn't just for launch - it's building a foundation for long-term success in the Web3 knowledge management space. We're looking at a multi-year project here, and this investment will help us stay competitive and grow sustainably.

Bottom line: This funding is key to achieving our goals and establishing Galaxy as a leader in the field. It's a strategic move that'll pay off in the long run.

Let me know if you want me to expand on anything!

hi @hehe where's that your doubts coming from? perhaps you're thinking in terms of market value, either in terms of development roadmap, in both cases if you analyze the proposal you'll come to a positive conclusion; it's been two years of progress, yet there are still years of work ahead and things to be done, before we actually reach the point where users be switching to Galaxy as a primary internet browsing tool;

it might be difficult to visualize the journey towards that point, as in current shape Galaxy Browser can be seen simply as a spatial photos manager, but let me try to build a ladder towards the explanation:

1. spatial environment is the missing component of a *visually* inter-connected inter-net

2. Excalidraw double-canvas implementation allows to render hundreds of images at the same visible viewport while keeping the performance up to 120fps

3. IC canister allows to upload images into the storage with guaranteed persistence

4. all types of digital documents(pdf,etc) and even dynamically generated content(weather widget, social network feed, etc) can be represented just as images (and then you can have more fun with them while moving around the canvas, instead of strictly scrolling down using pdf reader, you can actually manipulate the pages in any way it makes sense to you!)

5. linking between the images across all the collections naturally creates a decentralized web of knowledge (important: in contrast to one-way web-links, in case of galaxy linking its always two-directional and multi-targeted)

6. given publicly observable nature of the canister and built-in content monetization through viewers micropayments, the opportunity arises to build discovery agents who do the job of linking, in order to propagate the content from publisher towards interested consumers, and given the mechanism of layers transclusion, these agents doing the linking will be rewarded along with the actual authors (simply put, you subscribe to their content by embedding their canvas into yours)

7. images become interactive by executing macros functions attached to their metadata fields (as excel macros compute the value of cells in spreadsheet when the value of related cells changes, in similar way, galaxy macros are executed whenever observable fields changed, and then triggers the image element to transition into showing same or another linked image)

now once we have this ladder, in the context of galaxy milestone IV, let me guide you through the following imaginary scenario,

> where let's say you're into cooking and its time you want to share the knowledge of your secret pizza sauce to the world, these are your thoughts:
> 
> 1. You can wrap it up, the recipe into an article, - and post into your cooking blog or social networks, - but the problem it will be eventually inevitably lost in the ruthless stream of cat memes and unrelated news.
> 
> 2. Then, you can try to send the recipe link directly to each of your friends in a personal message, but the message is still missing very important context, - how does your recipe compare to all others, does it have any similarity to the recipes your friend already had experience with, and most importantly, - how does one verify correctness whether all the numbers like price and nutritional value of ingredients are not made up.
> 
> 3. Now you push the recipe into the canister, then what happens hopefully, its being automatically discovered by the agent who enriches your recipe with metadata proving correctness of all numbers, and embeds your recipe into a proper position within his gallery of sauces, and viewers subscribed to the agent can see your contribution added to the agent canvas which is already embedded into the viewer canvas (thanks transclusion!)

hopefully, above scenario demonstrates the place of Galaxy in the evolution of the internet,

(1) [independent] blogs & personal pages =>
(2) [still fragmented] forums & social networks =>
(3) [interconnected] spatial internet

and however exciting this scenario sounds, on the last note, it can't be launched independently (just milestone IV), and we should follow all the important steps accordingly to our milestones: 

(1) PKM => (2) KMS => (3) Social => (4) Web
