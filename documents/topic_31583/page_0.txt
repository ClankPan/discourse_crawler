## **Project highlights**

SCINET is building a suite of dapps to address a myriad of problems in the realm of life-sciences.  Our target users are life sciences research institutions, researchers, tech scouts, and research platforms.

The first problem we are solving is licensing complexity.

## **Web3 advantages**

SCINET is different than similar web2 projects like experiment.com in that users can very easily license IP using cryptocurrency, which transfers more quickly than fiat currency. The usage of internet identity also adds added security to our application.

## **How is it built**

SCINET's back end is composed of primarily motoko smart contracts, and utilizes google cloud storage and cloud functions for storing large files related to intellectual property. Our canisters utilize CanDB for enhanced scalability and our front ends utilize NFID for identity management. We also use [delastic-search](https://github.com/SCINET-INC/delastic-search) for enhanced search functionality.

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

Using NFID and internet identity under the hood simplified identity management and added extra security to the application.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

We are going to attract users through traditional sales pipelines and by tapping into the greater #desci community on twitter, linkedin, and discord.

## **Monetization**

We are in fact building for a profit. Our immediate monetization plan is to take a fee for each successful licensing deal that occurs on SCINET. In future dapps, we will charge monthly subscription fees and employ a traditional SaaS model. We have contemplated launching a SNS but are not sure that we want to go the governance route. 

## **Status of the project**

Our MVP is done and we are onboarding our first customer in the coming days. We have created an open-source library for [elastic search](https://github.com/SCINET-INC/delastic-search) on the IC and have built three different web apps to facilitate the MVP.

## **Future Plans**

Our next steps are to add automated NDA handling to the licensing process, add the ability for users to send crypto when buying a license, and starting to work on our next app, Helix, which is a decentralized research and development application. We are also raising a seed funding round so we can build these new features.
