Forgive me if this has been answered elsewhere. Also, any charts/metrics from previous testing showing how and if the transfer speed varies depending on upload size 1KB -> 4GB for each of these scenarios would be great.

Questions for the following 3 scenarios:

Note: when I say "client external to the IC", I mean something like a browser running a frontend application, or an AWS lambda

1. How long does it take to **upload** a GB of data from a client external to the IC **to** a canister on the IC?
2. How long does it take to **download** a GB of data **from** a canister to a client external to the IC?
3. How long does it take to **transfer** a GB of data **between** two canisters on the IC (inter-canister)?

<br/>

**Follow up question out of curiosity:** For scenarios (1) and (3), is it be possible to increase the speed of the upload or inter-canister transferring of data using a fire-and-forget type of update?
