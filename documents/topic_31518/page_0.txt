i just noticed that there's a `#BadBurn` error in TransferFrom candid spec, which implies that if a spender transfers on behalf of someone to the minter account, it is considered as burning. I'm confused to which blocktype should i use? `1burn` or `2xfer`? I'm asking because `to` is not specified in `1burn` but both `from` and `to` are musts in `2xfer`... and if it's `2xfer` it feels weird to me because i dont specify the minter account in `1burn` but now in `2xfer` i have to?

Use `2xfer` for `icrc2_transfer_from` blocks. Use for `1xfer` for `icrc1_transfer` blocks. 

Does that help?

Hmmm....this is a good question. 2xfer is going To capture the most info but won't be tagged as a burn by everyone unless they recognize the minting account,  maybe we need a 2burn? What happens on the cycle ledger in the case of a burn with transferFrom? @Severin 

In the motoko libraries i think the burn will occur because it passes the item trough to icrc1....I think...not at my computer.

We don't allow that, and we don't even have a minting account. We do have, however, have e.g. `create_canister_from`, which creates a `burn` block with a `from` field

I'm not into the standards, so maybe I'm missing something obvious...

donâ€™t allow burn from transfer_from

yea this was my implementation before noticing the #BadBurn error.
I think it made more sense to allow everyone but the minter to be involved in TransferFrom operation due to the 2xfer blocktype properties. 

Anyway, I'm gonna revert to my old implementation. Thank you.
