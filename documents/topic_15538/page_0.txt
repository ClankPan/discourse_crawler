Hello,

I want to serialise and then deserialise the `Identity`:`DelegationIdentity` that we get from `authClient.getIdentity()`. The goal is to generate authClient from the identity saved in browser's local storage.

Using `identity.toJson()` and then parsing the output does not work.

Also, `AuthClient.create` required identity of type `SignIdentity`.

How do I store the identity or better yet, the whole AuthClient in browser's localstorage?

The identity should already be stored in the browser. The default used to be local storage but now itâ€™s IndexedDB.

```js
import { LocalStorage, AuthClient } from '@dfinity/auth-client';
const storage = new LocalStorage();
const authClient = AuthClient.create({ storage });
```

Should do what you're looking for!
