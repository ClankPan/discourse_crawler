Hello community!

Our friends over at the UC Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator are [accepting applications](https://medium.com/berkeley-blockchain-xcelerator/uc-berkeley-blockchain-xcelerator-call-for-batch-4-application-1e3e1385f580) for their next cohort. They are interested in supporting early-stage projects on the Internet Computer, so if you are actively building, you should check this out! Feel free to DM me with questions.

Cheers,
Alexa
