Current status:
- on a Mac, you can build/deploy/upload the LLM, and then call an endpoint to have it generate tokens.
- it only works for a small model, because no use is made yet of the recent advancements of the IC (SIMD, float handling, etc.). 
- the README of the GitHub repo contains a list of TODOs
