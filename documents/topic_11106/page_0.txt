Hello!

I want to upgrade to a new version of an asset canister (website) to main IC network,  but failing to do so, since DFX says everything is already installed. I, however, have changed CSS styles and the code is not the same (but it seems dfx does not know how to figure out that there was a change in code of the main.css file and it's not the same as it was earlier.
Command I've ran is:
`dfx canister --network ic install deck_website_assets  --mode upgrade`

And the output is:

```

Can someone explain to me if I am doing something wrong and how we could update assset canister ?

Have you tried the deploy command?
I think you need to build first which is done by the deploy command

-------------------------

AnonymousCoder | 2022-02-24 17:33:44 UTC | #3

Instructions in the docs don't mention anything about deploying though. I will check it out now, thank you

-------------------------

AnonymousCoder | 2022-02-24 17:56:59 UTC | #4

Unfortunatelly, that is not possible since canister already exists (it has already been created the first time deploy was ran)

I've tried doing:
`dfx canister --network ic install deck_website_assets --mode reinstall`

To drop all code and state (which I don't have, since it's a website, no SC code) and everything went through this time, but no changes were made still. I hear ICP uses gzip for assets, is there a time period I would have to wait until the old gzipped assets are purged to see my changes or?


```
dfx canister --network ic install deck_website_assets --mode reinstall
Warning!
You are about to reinstall the deck_website_assets canister.
This will OVERWRITE all the data and code in the canister.

YOU WILL LOSE ALL DATA IN THE CANISTER.

Thereâ€™s a build step that coin_master mentioned which you may be missing? Try:

`dfx build deck_website_assets`

then

`dfx canister --network ic install deck_website_assets`

dfx deploy actually combines these two into a single command.

Thanks for trying to help! :)

I have tried deploy as well before trying to upgrade already deployed canister (command you posted would just deploy a completely new canister with a new canister ID on the network, which I don't currently want to do, since I already have deployed first version of it and would like to keep the canister ID the same, only upgrade it's code to the latest one). Whenever I want to use the 

`dfx canister -network ic install deck_website_assets --mode upgrade` 
I get "already installed" for each of the assets in the canister, which means it's not actually changing any assets of it (even though for example main.css file has been changed and code in it is not the same as it is currently in the deployed canister).

When I try doing a reinstall (that would also keep the canister ID the same and remove all the previous code and assets from it) with command
`dfx canister --network ic install deck_website_assets --mode reinstall`

everything seems to go through properly, you can see output of the command above in one of my comments on this post, but the changes are not actually made since the website looks exactly the same as before and has no updated main.css code in it.

Is there any way of accomplishing what I want to accomplish (upgrade or reinstall already deployed frontend assets canister without actually deploying a brand new canister with a new canister ID), or will I have to just abandon the current canister altogether, destroy it and deploy a new canister with the current code on the new address?

-------------------------

Are you able to build and update changes to the canister on a local replica (without the --network ic flag)?

-------------------------

AnonymousCoder | 2022-02-25 12:42:19 UTC | #9

``` 
novica@novica-desktop:/var/icp/deck_website$ dfx build deck_website_assets

Building canisters...

Building frontend...
```

That's the output I get when using build localy

After that I try to do 

`dfx canister -network ic install deck_website_assets --mode upgrade`
or
`dfx canister --network ic install deck_website_assets --mode reinstall`

and the above mentioned occurs for each

-------------------------

AnonymousCoder | 2022-02-25 20:33:46 UTC | #10

Seems that the solution is just using regular deploy command on the IC. It probably picks up canister id from `canister_ids.json` file in the folder root and then actually upgrades the same canister that was already deployed, instead of just deploying a brand new one on a new address. So,running:

`dfx deploy deck_webiste_assets --network ic`

is the way to upgrade the canister at the same IC address.

I am facing the same issue and I fail to understand what should we be doing beside what the official doc says. As of my understanding reinstall is for clearing state, upgrading is for upgrading code version and/or clearing state. I want to upgrade the code so I naturally do `dfx canister install --all --mode upgrade` with network flag  but it seems it has some cache and it is not deploying anything. Is running the deploy command consuming more cycles than a reinstall/upgrade?

[/quote]

It shouldn't but `deploy` is basically `canister create` plus `build` plus `install`. Did you re-build your wasm before trying to install?
