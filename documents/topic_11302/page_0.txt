Both proposals for the version [with](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48427) and [without](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48440) sandboxing are out.

The rollout is running smoothly although we had to place [a new proposal for the version without sandboxing](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/49011) due to an issue with the reproducibility of the artifact.  
[The release notes for next week's release are out](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/release-notes-for-new-replica-version-d004a/11445).

The rollout was completed [today by updating the NNS subnet](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/49451).
