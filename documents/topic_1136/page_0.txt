Hey all,

I'm Steve - a backend engineer by day, full stack maker by night. I found Dfinity by chance while checking google news. I was skeptical at first, but now after seeing what you actually have done I couldn't be more excited!

I've generally been following crypto since the mtgox days, and I have to admit as time has passed I've become fairly nihilist. Sure, new tokens, exchanges, and the like are exciting. But, as time has passed none of them are really shaping up to looking like they would ever become practical for real end users to use. I've been waiting for a platform that from the get-go is focused on letting you build real applications, for real people. From what I've seen so far, I believe that is the intention of this project. Now, I'm not sure what the economy update will bring, but I'm hoping it will make dfinity the best platform to build on!
