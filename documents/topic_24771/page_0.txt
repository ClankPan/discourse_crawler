I was following this https://daviddalbusco.com/blog/automatic-candid-generation-in-rust-exploring-the-ic-cdk-v0-10-0-update/ 

So,
I ran `cargo install candid-extractor` in my main terminal ? then I cd to my canister then I ran cargo build then `sh script/did.sh`
But I got this error 
```
Error: failed to find function export `get_candid_pointer`

```
Any help please?
My sh file
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash


function generate_did() {
  local canister=$1
  canister_root="src/$canister"

  cargo build --manifest-path="$canister_root/Cargo.toml" \
      --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
      --release --package "$canister"

  candid-extractor "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/$canister.wasm" > "$canister_root/$canister.did"
}

CANISTERS=user_canister

for canister in $(echo $CANISTERS | sed "s/,/ /g")
do
    generate_did "$canister"
done
```

Also, it is intersting that `echo $canister_root/$canister` shows `user_canister/user_canister`
I also added 
```rs
ic_cdk_macros::export_candid!();
``` 
at the end of the file `user_canister/lib.rs`

solved by adding all the struct to lib.rs and make them public also somthing like

```
use user::*;
use files::*;
use files_content::*;
use contracts::*;
use friends::*;
use share_files::*;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use queries::*;
use updates::*;
use ic_websocket_cdk::*;
use websocket::*;
```

```
[bizkit@archlinux cosmicrafts_icp]$ npm run generate

> cosmicrafts_icp_frontend@0.2.0 generate
> scripts/did.sh && dfx generate && npm run format

    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.05s

```

yeah same issue here, I also tried to add allthe s truct to lib.rs and make it public, but for me it didn't work


```
use candid::*;

use std::cell::*;

use serde::*;

use ic_cdk_macros::*;

use ic_websocket_cdk::*;

use canister::*;
```

Did you also do the
ic_cdk_macros::export_candid!();

on your other rust scripts or just on the lib.rs?
also, I've read on David's blog something about the candid methods that must be removed, how did you manage to do that?
