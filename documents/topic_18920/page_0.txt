Hello everyone,

Where i can find the motoko idl file for the deployed ICRC1 standard file.

How we can call the below methods from another canister ? Thanks 
icrc1_balance_of
icrc1_transfer

Not sure what's "motoko idl" but we got candid types and related JS files in `@dfinity/ledger` if it can help
