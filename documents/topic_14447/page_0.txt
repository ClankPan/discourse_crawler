TL;DR: https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#optimization

The Effective Rust Canisters article (first featured in https://forum.dfinity.org/t/best-practices-for-canisters-in-rust-now-available-as-text/8169) just got a [new section on canister optimization](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#optimization).
Thank @dsarlis and @berestovskyy for implementing the performance_counter API (I was waiting for this API to write the new section!) and for their feedback on the article's first draft.
Enjoy!
