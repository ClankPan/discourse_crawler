Hello,
if you're not working on Verifiable Credentials issuer for IC, you can stop reading now.

The newest release candidate for Internet Identity ([proposal 128351](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=128351)) requires presence of `derivation_origin`-endpoint on compliant issuers (cf. [spec](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#2-derivation-origin), and [this PR](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/pull/2357) for the rationale). Once the proposal is accepted and the candidate deployed (probably on Monday, March 18, in the afternoon CET), the VC flow will fail for issuers without the endpoint.

Apologies in advance for the problems it may cause.  We've planned to make it mandatory eventually, and it seems that it is better to do it now, while we (probably) don't have real issuers on the IC yet. Adding a default endpoint is just a few lines of code (cf. the [spec](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#2-derivation-origin) and an [example](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/demos/vc_issuer/src/main.rs#L301)).

Cheers,
- Bartosz.
