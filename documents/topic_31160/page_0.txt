ckUSDC which is a digital twin of USDC is now available on ICP. More info [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cketh-a-canister-issued-ether-twin-token-on-the-ic/22819/169).

Thanks for the reply, did that just happen or awhile ago?  sorry Iâ€™m new!

It launched on ICP mainnet last week!

By digital twin you mean its a wrapped erc20 token?

With the way that chain key technology works I wouldnâ€™t quite call it a wrap of the other token. Hence the term twin.

Exactly, thank you @ckMood.

We donâ€™t call them wrapped, because there is no centralized middleman when converting between one token and another. Converting from USDC and ckUSDC is completely on-chain and permissionless.

Afaik ckUSDC is not real USDC, just a copy of it issued by custodial subnet, which in turn is governed by NNS - A single point of failure. Its a wrapped token.


The term digital twin implies there's a physical coin of USDC, like how Origyn used to describe their AI fingerprint NFTs of physical luxury goods, example: a Watch.


In the simplest terms, ckUSDC is an ICRC token, which is a wrapped version of ERC20 USDC token custodied by ICP subnet with chain key?


just semantics maybe

On the roadmap there's also a box that talks about native USDC coming to ICP:

At first I thought that was just referring to ckUSDC but that's already live while the box in the picture is listed under "*future* features" section. :rocket: :rocket:

I think itâ€™s worth noting the difference between typical bridges vs. chain key technology. While ckUSDC is hosted on the IC using its own token standard which is a sort of jacketed version an ERC20 token standard, it is a fundamental difference from typical bridges and custodial means of wrapping tokens.

Iâ€™ve learned a lot, thanks for all the replies, looking forward to native usdc on IC ðŸ¤˜
