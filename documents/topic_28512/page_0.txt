Hello,

We are building a game and we want to offer our players a possibility to stake their nft's to earn some rewards and to be able to set the nft as `profile picture`. Is it possible to safely lock the nft in a canister so no one else except the owner will be able to unlock it and/or is it possible to offer them some rewards for it?
I could not find any good example in motoko to achieve this

Thanks.
