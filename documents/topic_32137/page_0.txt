Hello @AssanSav 

Sorry to hear that you have issues loading the NNS dapp. To look into what is going wrong, it would help us a lot if you could provide us with the following information (you can also send it to me via DM):

* Where are you based?
* Is it only the NNS dapp or also other dapps (e.g., internetcomputer.org, dfinity.org, identity.ic0.app)?
* For how long can't you use the nns dapp (minutes, hours, days)?
* Do you experience that only on your phone or also on your computer?

hi @AssanSav ! can you advise whether you use a mobile provider or home wifi when you try to access nns or internet identity sites? What internet providers are you using?

I was using WiFi, but now it works with my mobile provider.

Unrelated issue: I was trying to access the NNS dapp to dissolve my staked neurons from November 23, 2023. However, I noticed that the dissolve date has auto-increased till January 25th 2025. What's the issue? Am I missing something? I am fairly new to ICP staking

hi @AssanSav ! unfortunately, I cannot advise on the neuron stakes. Can you please share what internet service provider you use at home - we'll check the connectivity from that provider to the ic0.app. :pray:

Wave broadband is the provider.

Also which service can I contact for the staking issue?

Thanks for the info @AssanSav ! We'll investigate and get back to you!
For the staking issue you can [contact DFINITY support](https://support.dfinity.org/).

Hi again @AssanSav ! 
We can see that Wave Broadband doesn't block IC fully, just partially. This could be an individual configuration of your home router. We suggest to contact Wave Broadband support and ask them why nns.ic0.app doesn't open. Please get back to us with a reply, if you can!
