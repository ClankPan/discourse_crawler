How much time did you spend integrating wallets to your dapp?

Did you build your own internal wallet to fix the problem of users having different principals when they sign in?

Do you want one package that handles wallet sign in, global wallet addresses for on-chain wallets like NFID Wallet, and transaction approvals without caring which wallet the user is connected with?

Then you should `npm install` [NFID IdentityKit](https://identitykit.xyz).
- Conforms to all the new ICRC wallet standards
- Currently supports NFID Wallet (with Plug, Internet Identity, and Stoic coming next week... Oisy next month)
- One "Connect wallet" button for your users
- Support for global addresses/principals from on-chain wallets
