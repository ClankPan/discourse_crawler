If I follow this guide: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/frontend/svelte-frontend

to setup a fresh svelte project, I face the following error with the : @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte package.

npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
npm ERR! ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm ERR!
npm ERR! While resolving: learn@0.0.0
npm ERR! Found: svelte@3.59.2

It seems there version @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte package version is wrong? 

How can I fix this ?

After a long try and error session, I found the following working configuration for package.json. with is settings there are no errors. But some packages are outdated, like dfinity/agent. Id you change this to the current version 0.20 then you receive some dependencies errors, because @connect2ic/core uses this old version.

{
  "name": "svelte",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@connect2ic/core": "^0.1.1",
    "@connect2ic/svelte": "^0.1.1",
    "@dfinity/agent": "^0.11.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte": "1.0.0-next.49",
    "@types/node": "^18.0.0",
    "buffer": "^6.0.3",
    "svelte": "^3.59.2",
    "svelte-preprocess": "^4.10.7",
    "typescript": "^4.7.4",
    "vite": "^2.9.13"
  }
}

So my question is, how can I get an actual setup for svelte. Most packages are outdated even the svelte one.

So this is an official example: Shouldn't these versions be current?

For svelte/ icp stuff you can't get much better than David and his Juno build https://github.com/junobuild/juno 

I've taken a lot of learning from that repo.

@peterparker tagging because you're a giga-brain with this kind of stuff :smiley:

You're right, he's definitely a rock star. But this repo ist too much for beginners.

By the why also other official svelte examples are still not working: e.g.

https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/svelte/sveltekit-starter

Oisy Wallet, proposals.network, etc. I always follow the same setup, if those repo sound less 'too big'.

Regarding the issue, it's pretty clear: the package.json is outdated and contains incompatibilities. It tries to install Svelte v3, but Vite requires v4.

Those repo are not maintained, probably why.

Haha, no I'm thinking that I've got literally a large over head, I should check in a mirror :rofl:

I just have a single working setup that I replicate across projects, and I make iterative adjustments whenever I encounter an issue. Not big brain at all, just maintainance and constant development.

After updating the npm packages from the sveltekit-starter example and some smaller changes, I was able to run the svelte starterkit example for svelte 4.2.3.

The following changes were made:

> .prettierrc => remove "pluginSearchDirs": ["."],
> dfx.json => change local port to 4943
> vit.config.ts => change also the local port to 4943

> changes to the package.json file
