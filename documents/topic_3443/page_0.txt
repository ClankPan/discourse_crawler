Hello, 
  I created a Neuron and started dissolving in NNS. I then configured every topic by following DFINITY Foundation. Somehow, I got additional unknown following with unspecified topics. See the attached picture, ID 28 is the unknown following. 

   I tried to unfollow for every topic, and see if it can reset the following. But the unknown following still remains. 

  Anyone has any suggestions?  Thanks!
