I get this error message when trying to build `replica` (well, `drun` to be precise, but should be the same):
```

Is the open source dumping missing the new(?) crate `ic_registry_subnet_features`? @basvandijk maybe?

May I bump this? It's not good when the published code is incomplete (and it hinders the Motoko team as well).

@claudio can you maybe ping Bas or who else is currently working on the open source code extraction script?

Thanks for the ping. Claudio bumped this up internally.

Apparently, the missing crate has been re-added and will be out with the next RC.

It seems that <https://github.com/dfinity/ic> still doesnâ€™t have that fix, and also none of the other code changes since September 16. Did something slip through the cracks?

Hello guys,

I'm still facing the same issue,
is there any fix?

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-10-21 04:39:28 UTC | #7

I will ping the team. Sorry for the delay, @ayazgv

We're really close to open-sourcing the entire IC repo, so this problem will be a history pretty soon.
In the meantime, I'll update the existing repo https://github.com/dfinity/ic with the latest version deployed to the NNS subnet, as soon as the new revision is pushed to it.

-------------------------

I see new commits in dfinity/ic! Whoohoo!
I wasn't able to check if they build now, yet, though.
