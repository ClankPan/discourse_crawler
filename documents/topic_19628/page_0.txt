Hello everyone!

We have launched a new project called IDgeek. 

https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.ic0.app/

IDgeek is a secure and automated marketplace for buying or selling Internet Identity (II) Anchors with their linked assets. 

The concept of selling II Anchors (and their linked neurons) has been a topic of discussion in various forums and communities, with differing opinions on its advantages and disadvantages.

**Our vision is to address the lack of security surrounding the transfer or sale of II Anchors by providing a solution through IDgeek.**

How it works.

To sell your II Anchor, the first step is to transfer it to the IDgeek smart contract, which will take control of the Anchor and allow the owner to receive it back if needed. Once the Anchor is transferred, you can list it on the IDgeek Marketplace. Upon successful sale, the money will be transferred to your account.

Important to note that on the IC, there is a way to keep access to the NNS even without having access to the actual Anchor. This can be done by granting permissions for up to 30 days using custom NNS interface. It is impossible to see or remove granted permissions. Therefore when you transfer your Anchor to IDgeek, there is a 30-day protection period. During this time, if your Anchor is sold, the Anchor and the funds will be held in an escrow account until the protection period is over. This is done to protect the buyer from fraudulent activities. After 30 days, IDgeek's smart contract will check if the state of the accounts and neurons has been changed. If everything is okay, the transaction will be completed as normal. But if the seller tries to cheat, the transaction will be cancelled, and the buyer will get their money back.

**We would greatly appreciate your feedback! Please share your thoughts with us.**

Dfinity has told us that neuron marketplaces are a threat to ICP’s security. 

So it would be good to get a discussion going with the foundation. Many in the community are worried and so I think we should discuss considerations. 

@bjoernek

That said, it is nice to be able to buy cool anchors so well done on creating a great user experience.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-04-26 22:10:17 UTC | #3

I agree.  I would like to hear from Dfinity on this marketplace, especially since it enables quick neuron transfer at discounted rates.

-------------------------

Manu | 2023-04-27 09:02:37 UTC | #4

In my personal view, I don't think this poses a big threat. This only allows sale of neurons tied to II in the NNS FE dapp, which I think is a tiny fraction of the voting power. Neurons created with dfx / quill / ledger nano cannot be transferred with this method.

Thank god you are here Manu <3

benji | 2023-04-27 13:51:28 UTC | #6

Is the code open source? Can the community check it?

What is the mechanism for the canister to hold the II? Does that mean that the canister is storing a secret?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-04-27 20:45:29 UTC | #7

Manu,

How are you able to determine this fact? Is there a way to see a breakdown of neurons that are II-generated vs. dfx / quill / ledger generated? 

Perhaps this is also a question for @Kyle_Langham

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-04-28 12:22:07 UTC | #8

* Just to confirm from the side of DFINITY: We still have concerns on neuron markets for security reasons. In particular, we believe that it should be difficult to transfer neurons in order to ensure that neurons have skin in the game and thus vote in the long-term interest of the IC.
* As mentioned by Manu above, this particular project focusing on transferring Internet Identity anchors is currently not a major concern, because neurons with substantial voting power are typically managed by alternative measures (DFX, Hardware wallet, Quill).
* The team is still exploring ideas on how to make it more difficult to transfer neurons (or provide additional incentives to neurons which are not transferable). This could also affect neurons controlled by Internet Identity.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-04-28 13:02:48 UTC | #9

Hi Bjoern!

I'm really struggling to see how this is a network security issue... in fact, if Dfinity is concerned about having 'skin in the game' I think we should remove all Named Neurons and require people to vote manually.  Below are three scenarios:

1) I buy 100 ICP off the market and stake and vote = 100 ICP skin in the game
2) I buy a neuron with 100 ICP locked for 80 ICP and vote = 80 ICP skin in the game
3) I create a named neuron with 1 ICP (or actually just share by neuron number) for people to follow and get 100 ICP worth of followers = 1 ICP skin in the game

All 3 scenarios give me the same Voting Power however only one scenario has a security risk because of no skin in the game.  Selling neurons is not a security risk especially when compared to Named Neurons.

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-04-28 14:03:19 UTC | #10

The problem is more that the closer you get to selling/buying neurons, the closer we are to flash-loans and all the related attack vectors. In other words, it's the _duration_ of skin in the game, not (only) the amount that is important

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-04-28 14:20:38 UTC | #11

You're missing the point about potentially following a Named Neuron with NO skin in the game!  Duration is irrelevant.

Also, missing the fact that it would still be incredibly costly to buy enough ICP (which you will need to buy neurons) or neurons to make such an attack... and then what?  You still have the financial risk.

Whereas a Named Neuron doesn't have that financial risk and can still vote with all the followed VP.

Some quick math... I want 100m VP roughly 50m ICP... I want to buy existing neurons and let's say I can get a 40% discount so that is 30m ICP I need or 180m USD (this example completely ignores that this purchase volume will make the price of ICP and neurons rocket)... then I pass a bad proposal and my 180m USD is worthless?!

Meanwhile I can collude with a few Named Neurons and get 100m VP for much cheaper and less risk.

[/quote]

I'd like to further add that flashloans are **impossible** on the IC, due to the lack of atomicity. The action of "acquiring VP -> vote -> sell VP" is neither risk-free nor zero-cost, thus the IC is very resistant to such attacks compared to other implementations on other chains.

-------------------------

alexeychirkov | 2023-04-28 14:46:00 UTC | #13

We are planning to open source the whole project and blackhole the module which controls the Anchors. I cannot provide an exact ETA at this moment though.

To gain control over an Anchor, the canister first obtains the public key through the threshold ECDSA protocol. Then, the process of adding this key to the list of devices for the transferred Anchor takes place. Once the public key from the canister is added, the canister removes all other devices associated with the Anchor, thereby gaining exclusive control over it in the InternetIdentity app. 
It is important to note that after taking control, there is a maximum period of 30 days during which previously issued delegates for accessing various applications (excluding InternetIdentity) can still exist for the Anchor. Until these delegates expire, the owner has the ability to perform operations on the respective applications. This is why we impose a 30-day protection period for selling. No secret keys are stored, and threshold ECDSA protocol is used for signatures. 
The owner who initiated this process is associated with the Anchor. The owner can make sale offers, and in the event of a purchase, ownership is transferred to the buyer. Additionally, the owner can initiate the return of the Anchor's control to their own device. During the return process, the canister registers the user's device, and after access confirmation, removes its public key from the list of devices.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-04-28 17:17:03 UTC | #14

I think the following summarizes my thoughts on this subject.  And I'll note that I don't want this to take away from the very cool technical accomplishment of IDGeek.  This tech(and tecdsa and/or subnet signed based neurons coming soon) was inevitable and these conversations are just part of the healthy evolution of the IC. Also, there are very likely ways to sell IIs that keeps the neurons from being part of that equation.

Copied from my tweet here:  https://twitter.com/afat/status/1651993585280073728

I had to sleep on this to come up with a better example. I think there are a couple that I’ll try to lay out now.

In the US, you have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the right to a trial by jury. This creates an imbalance where, generally, you can't keep someone in jail while the state builds its case.

The system in place to deal with this is the "bail bond" system, which aims to ensure that citizens maintain their rights while the state upholds the rule of law.

This bail bond is a "demand contract." It requires that a specific person appear on a designated date to stand trial if they want their cash back. When SBF posts a $250,000,000 bond to guarantee his court appearance, the state holds those funds in escrow. If Gary Gensler shows up on the trial date and says "sorry, I paid my buddy SBF $125M, and I'm here to stand in his place, please return his bond to me," the state will refuse, explaining that he fundamentally misunderstands the justice system and then confiscate the $250M bond. Allowing someone else to face judgment breaks the system of rule of law and promotes lawlessness, resulting in a worse society than would exist if justice were upheld. Laws aren't a sufficient deterrent to lawlessness if you can pay someone to take the heat for you.

Furthermore, this bail money isn't meant to compensate for the lack of justice if SBF doesn't show up. Although it may help mitigate the consequences, it's ultimately a different currency, and the result is a less just system than if the offender were held accountable or exonerated. This situation creates a tragedy of the commons, and the proverbial cup is not as full as it could have been. There is less justice because the subject has bypassed the system.

A NNS neuron is a form of demand contract, similar to a bail bond. The difference is that your actions (or hopefully productive governance) won't be judged until the end of your staking contract. The contract exists to provide security to those using, investing in, and building on the platform. You indebt yourself to the platform, and it agrees to pay you maturity for your votes as long as you stand trial at the end and face the consequences of your performance. The market conducts this trial, rewarding you if the value of your bond increased and punishing you if it decreased.

If someone else appears for the trial, it breaks the social contract in place. Specifically, the NNS is willing to pay you for coordinating with the network under the assumption of the bond contract.

This security is a commons owned by the network as a public good. An individual trying to privatize personal gain from the commons at the expense of the commons is generally considered to be committing a crime.

You can't dump toxic waste in the sewer, claim personal sovereignty, profit, and expect a functioning ecosystem in the future.

If you believe it's acceptable for Alice to pay Bob to dump her toxic waste in the sewer and that it's just "two individuals trading toxic waste," then we have fundamentally different philosophical viewpoints on the commons and public goods. A few people doing this can disrupt the entire ecosystem…they don’t have to singlehandedly have the ability to induce a terminal velocity toward complete environmental destruction for it to be bad for everyone.

On the Internet Computer, the NNS has been granted a monopoly on computational and financial authority over the platform participants. This arrangement has its drawbacks, especially as Andrea points out, the distribution of voting power isn't exactly egalitarian at this point. Additionally, we don't have a judicial system in place to protect a set of "rights" against potential mob overreach. It's evident that we have a long way to go in terms of governance mechanisms. While these are separate debates, they are worth having (or revisiting) at some point. However, the lack of a comprehensive system shouldn't cause us to compromise on network security or stand by while individuals try to privatize the very thing that makes the whole system work for personal gain. This approach is a recipe for a toxic ecosystem.

Possible solutions (the right solution may exist at some intersection of these, but they are gradients, not absolutes) include:

1. Use proof of personhood to constantly sign the bond and/or quarantine voting power if the person doesn’t provide zero-knowledge proof that they are the original staker upon each vote or follower designation.

2. Force everyone to auto-stake maturity so that they can't benefit financially until the trial date (a non-starter if we want to attract stakers until the system has enough utility for governance to have its own intrinsic value).

3. Attempt to track and quarantine neurons (the worst solution, as Andrea has pointed out, this unfairly benefits elites who can hide their activity).

4. Voluntary quarantine for an agreed-upon period and then allow a sale (suggested by coolpineapple).

5. Explore other potential solutions collaboratively.

I’m not looking for anyone to provide a cure-all today…as [@accumulatingicp](https://twitter.com/accumulatingicp) has mentioned, we have “some” time before we might be in a place where brutal damage could be inflicted from this. But I do think we should get to a place where we can agree that there are dangers here, including death by 1000 cuts, that we should be proactive about discussing and planning for.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-04-29 08:13:19 UTC | #15

I find it hilarious and to be honest completely hypocritical to refer to staking as a contract with the NNS…considering that you led the charge to change the terms of that “contract” (ie staking/governance rewards) several times!

Super cool app and interesting thread of discussion!

One observation is that buying neurons is different than buying voting power. If the concern is the latter, I would argue that purchasing VP can already be done easily, and even manually! As long as it is possible to verify if a neuron has voted on a given topic, VP can be purchased. Worrying that an II market would lead to purchase of VP is perhaps absurd.

The full impact of liquid neurons is yet to be understood. For example, should an 8-year locked neuron of 1 ICP sell for greater than 1 ICP, or less? It seems arguments can be swayed both ways. Can't wait to see more development of this market! Good job guys! I think it is a great experiment, will be rooting for you!

skilesare | 2023-04-29 11:32:04 UTC | #18

The NNS provides mutability for the protocol. Only self restraint and social norms can keep abuse from being a reality. 

**IF** the NNS chose to make some change(which I think is essential for the n long term health of the protocol) here it is probably very wise to grandfather in existing neurons under current rules.

Also, dude

![image|300x168](upload://thWfnwwNUQE3txOtFfjGp8KbBhQ.jpeg)

You lobbied excessively to change the replica to get a taggr's canister back.

Your sanctimonious stance on immutability has 0 weight anymore. You sold your soul to devil. (Turns out the mutable canister devil is actually a really cool dude tho...helpful to have around in a pinch).

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-04-29 11:44:49 UTC | #19

The consistency of your arguments are completely hilarious!  

YOU are the one arguing about the immutability of neuron ownership!

I’m the one saying it should be mutable like everything else on this chain.

Please try to keep up!

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-04-29 12:08:30 UTC | #20

Let me be more clear then. We should judiciously Shepard the platform to maximize the value of the network in the long term.

This may include mechanisms that create incentivizes, punishments, and structures that do this. We should prioritize incentives over punishments, but punishments may be necessary for the health of the network.

Immutability isn't a cure all for everything all the time. In this instance, finding a mechanism that secures the "skin in the game" mechanism is maximal for the network. Canister architecture is a different issue. As is governance. As is rewards. As is *x*.

Maximize the long term value of the network. Period.

Does tradable neurons do that? No. It subverts the fundamental skin in the game mechanism and offers no mitigating for the loss of security in that mechanism.

-------------------------

FGhostwriting | 2023-04-29 12:46:28 UTC | #21

I rarely comment here, but I'm probably reaching the wrong audience on Twitter, so I'll give it a go. 

Tradable neurons mean we own our neurons. 

Web 3.0 = Own 

So either we own the asset or the ICP blockchain is not a Web 3.0 protocol. 

We keep trying to overcomplicate the neuron marketplace when, in fact, it actually helps defend the network as being Web 3.0.

Hey IDGeeks great job developing this marketplace. Very cool concept. 

Any plans of developing a bribery marketplace which would allow neuron holders to rent out their voting power for individual proposals? I think that would be a interesting idea. In this marketplace neuron holders would retain ownership of their neurons but would instead rent them out temporarily for a price. Similar to the convex liquidity bribery for curve pools. 

Voting power has a nonzero value. In the future, it will be more economically efficient for someone seeking to amass voting power to simply bribe other neurons rather then buying their neuron outright. 

If we want to prevent large amount of voting power from being controlled by individual entities the best thing we can do for now would be Removing  neuron following from NNS in order to force people to vote for themselves and prevent a few neurons from amassing large percentage of voting power. @alexeychirkov

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2023-04-29 16:47:12 UTC | #23

1) saying there’s no skin in the game just isn’t true and I’ve explained this above… if you buy a neuron you are still paying liquid ICP for locked ICP and therefore have skin in the game!  So either you don’t understand how the market will work or you’re being disingenuous…

2) saying that tradable neurons is bad is an opinion unless you can demonstrate with evidence…and you can’t!  And in my opinion trying to steal people’s staking/voting rewards IS bad for this chain.

3) why are you still talking about immutability?!  Your views on immutability are irrelevant and apparently mutable!  Immutable neuron ownership seems be the only thing you believe it…even though you’re completely fine with changing the “contract” terms under which people stake.

Also, this whole debate is already settled because guess what…we currently have tradable neurons!

Finally, two last points… 1) if you think that some retail investor selling their 100 ICP neuron is going subvert the democracy you’re not being serious, and 2) if you think a large institutional investor is going to be stopped and/or use an app to do this you also aren’t being serious

The biggest risk to this chain is named neurons who actually don’t have any skin in the game and the politics associated with them.

@mechaquan you would be much more persuasive if you would stop trying to belittle or trivialize the arguments made by others.  Your ad hominem attacks and straw man arguments are turning you into background noise, but you are capable of so much more.  Personally, I have grown tired of trying to engage you in a discussion specifically because of this behavior.  This forum thread is replete with examples.

[/quote]

From my view (not DFINTY), the main security risks are:

* In the short term
  * Step A: Employees/investors being able to sell before they have fully vested, resulting in a large increase in liquidity ("circulating supply") and a proportional decline in token price.
  * Step B: It is now easier to purchase ICP & gain voting power, potentially enough to pass a malicious & irreversible proposal

* Constant threats (long/short term):
  * A large company (Facebook) or government can quickly and silently accumulate enough ICP to "buy the network", and pass a majority malicious replica change.
  * If neuron marketplaces exist, neuron loaning marketplaces may develop, allowing people to temporarily transfer their neuron for a holding fee + short term premium to "sell their vote/voting power" for a specific proposal, and then to return the neuron to its original owner after the vote. This has the same security implications as the previous point.

Why make it so complicated? In blockchain, there is information about which neuron voted when and for what. You can buy votes without this marketplace. The neuron voted as needed, and the principal received the payment. And there is no need for any complicated schemes with transferring neurons. Or you can simply follow specific neuron and receive a reward.

Hey Wenzel!  Great job taking my non ad hominem attacks out of context!  Sorry sarcasm doesn’t come across great via text…

Btw, every time you’ve engaged with me recently it’s not been via debate but rather commenting on my discussions with someone else…so…

Do you have any arguments to add to this debate or are you going to merely be some spectator who snipes from the sidelines?!  If not, it seems you are more interested in attacking my character… good luck with that.

Finally, I’m not trying to persuade anyone… I genuinely don’t care… I have no intention of selling my neurons but I do plan on continuously calling out ridiculous arguments that are false.

Have a great day/night!

Couldn’t a large company just buy ICP and stake to perform a hostile takeover?!

They wouldn’t need to necessarily buy neurons… the problem you explain exists regardless of neurons being tradable, right?!

Also, for the amount of ICP/VP needed to significantly sway a vote it would be time/cost consuming to find enough neuron sellers to affect a particular vote IMO.

I haven't ever said that the new owner doesn't have skin in the game(Although if the second owner also has an out then they have less skin in the game than an owner who has no out).  I've argued that the previous owner has a pathway to less skin in the game than would have otherwise been there and that requiring maximum skin in the game by everyone leads to better long-term collective wisdom of the crowd decisions making.

> 2. saying that tradable neurons is bad is an opinion unless you can demonstrate with evidence…and you can’t! And in my opinion trying to steal people’s staking/voting rewards IS bad for this chain.

Damn it mechquan...you're going to make me write an agent-based model that demonstrates that I'm right. I think you're being obtuse as I don't think that this a hard concept to grasp if the idea of governance has any merit whatsoever(and if it doesn't, fine...lets manage the network differently...but a different debate).

In the meantime, here are some psychological papers that demonstrate how longer-term time horizons lead to better decision-making:

I particularly love this one "Tying Odysseus to the Mast".... which demonstrates an 81% performance improvement for commiters: https://ashrafnava.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/tyingodysseus_qje.pdf

There is an entire field of study on this called "Commitment Devices."

If these aren't enough evidence for you I'll try to argue from the absurd side by saying that if we don't think that long-term time commitments to outcomes are effective, then what the hell are we even doing here? If we do think they are effective, then there is some asymptote that is approached as the time commitment increases. If you offer an out, you are picking a place further away from the potential maximum.

Do we want to be on the left side of this graph?

I've ceded that we should make any changes on a go-forward basis(unless there is an imminent short-term threat).  If I could go back to the recalc of rewards I'd propose that it only affect future neurons and/or offer all neurons an unlock.  Norms are important and I did not expect the blowback that a vocal corner of the community had. You guys make some good points and I think going forward we should be more thoughtful on how changes are rolled out.

If we add something like a zk signature of consistent personhood in the future, I'd propose that it only apply to future neurons and/or future staked maturity.

The majority of ICP and voting power is locked up, with age bonus multipliers. There isn’t enough liquid ICP to perform a hostile takeover at this moment. 

Allowing neurons to be tradable through a marketplace makes a hostile takeover a potential reality that the foundation and community need to take seriously.

Zane | 2023-04-30 00:27:26 UTC | #32

Thing is you need a way to reliably verify a certain principal actually owns a specific neuron and that isn't quite possible right now afaik. 
The only way would be to ask the neuron owner to top up the stake with an tiny random amount, but it is a bit cumbersome and has to be done with every neuron, which is why nobody has done 8 year only airdrops yet, trustless neuron transfer automates this process and generally makes selling VP to different entities way easier for users.

I second this ✅ 

Also I would like to add to this discussion by taking a glance at Plato’s analogy of the cave. To be more specific I would like to focus on the shadow in the cave. 

The shadows, be it by light coming from the candle or the light from outside the cave, still, is a shadow in the cave. To my understanding, Plato’s vision was to divert the vision of people from focusing on the candle and get their vision outside the cave to maximize their exploratory naturalistic human instincts. However once people have been in a cave for ages they might not want to leave the cave for better shadow figures that might exist out of the cave. 

My focus being shadows; I want to clarify on some of the ideas raised above by @skilesare. Though someone can argue that both shadows be it from the candle or the sun are the same they actually are not. It is the same concept as trying to explain what makes the grass green is it chlorophyll or the wavelength of light that reaches human eyes. 
The candle and the sun emit light at different wavelengths; but are the shadows the same? Is the shadow the absence of the emitted light or the collusion of the light once it hits the object? 

Bringing these analogies to the topic in discussion, are tradable neurons the same before and after they are sold? Or should they be striped of their voting power once they get to the marketplace? What is the purpose of creating a neuron market place? 

I would like to argue that the neurons after being traded are not the same anymore! Just like the shadow from a candle is not the same as the shadow from the sun. They should be of a secondary class…and not hold as much weight as the primary staked neurons.

Neurons that are traded should have a punishable mechanism! ; which is that they do not have voting power! 

This is to safeguard the longevity of the network 💫💯

I think you’re being obtuse

Careful… Wenzel might write a post about your ad hominem attacks!  Just kidding we know his observations are one sided.

Unfortunately, I think you’re being naive because nothing is going to stop large ICP holders from being able to sell large neurons and they won’t use an app to do it.

Good luck trying to punish people who do…

It would take 100s of millions of dollars to buy enough neurons or ICP to perform a hostile takeover without even considering the price action that would ensue.

Huge sales or transfer of ownership don’t happen on a marketplace.  They happen in boardrooms.

So I don’t think a marketplace for trading sub 1k ICP neurons would/could be a bad thing.

mechaquan | 2023-04-30 12:10:03 UTC | #37

Pretty much buying all or enough voting power to control the network.

The theory is this will become increasingly expensive as we hit supply shock.  The price of ICP and therefore neurons would become exponentially expensive.

This is why most of the time there’s an offer made to the board (for example Elon with Twitter)…for a decentralized network someone could make a proposal with an offer.

I think it would be very difficult…my concern is it would be far easier and less expensive for a few large named neurons to collude as they have much less risk… or skin in the game compared to their VP.

I agree that there is very little incentive for named neurons to behave rationally. This should be a way for voters to provoke themselves, even if their name neuron has already voted as long as the voting window is still open, just in case one of them go rogue.

Also wanting to know

Would be cool if Dfinity just enabled people to unlock instantly for a slash/fee which is determined by staking length, and then burnt thereby reducing the supply

You have totally my support.

Its not new that [skilesare](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/skilesare) and [wpb](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/wpb) are in favor for redirecting peoples rewards to their own interest or " pay devs", not a surprise they want to prevent people from gtfo from the narrative they try to implement.

Following screenshot already illustrate peoples positions ( feel free to find more obvious one )

So yeah, could they POSSIBLY BE BIASED ? They didn't even answer your argument properly because they know you are right. Even Manu personally think that this Market isnt an security issue. So yeah its about $$

I am opposed to similar sales and purchases. This is actually a loophole. The value of voting rights is underestimated in disguise. Some people with ulterior motives can buy or even borrow voting rights at a low price to happen something we don’t want to see

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 15:05:07 UTC | #48

No, I don't work for anyone, I bought ICP, I will only be responsible for myself! I will object to any behavior that harms ICP

Totally against buying and selling neurons. It has to be something outside of dfinity.. :x: :x: :x:

I will be pleased to tell you that Dfinity is not behind the selling of neuron and are not wasting ressources on it ( unless they want to prevent it, which I think is bad )

Web 3.0 = Own

So either we own the asset or the ICP blockchain is not a Web 3.0 protocol.

We keep trying to overcomplicate the neuron marketplace when, in fact, it actually helps defend the network as being Web 3.0.
[/quote]

You still own the neuron if purchased but there should be a measure in place to properly address how this poses a security risk to someone gathering large amounts of voting power and using this power in aggregate to harm future governance.Why else would someone by a neuron other than for voting power? It can't be for the ICP or assets listed because you can just buy those on your own. While it may be costly to try and take over the network it's not completely impossible. What would stop a large player, say a competitor, from slowly gathering neurons over time to centralize votes, if not to otherwise use them maliciously? I think it's significant enough to need to be addressed.

[/quote]

I think a way to perhaps implement this penalty is that purchased neurons through a marketplace should be delayed the use of voting power in one of a 3 ways. 

1. equal to the total dissolve delay that was intially set which as we know is at least 6 months

2. a static delay of use that is determined through a proposal

3. an equation that takes into account amount of ICP in the neuron, dissolve delay, and age bonus at the time of sale.

This way this marketplace is not completely eliminated, as I believe people should be able to trade their neurons if the wish, but is also handled in a way that preserves the security of the IC.

🚀 **Introducing a new feature! Buy and sell individual SNS Neurons on [IDgeek](https://idgeek.app)!** 🚀

Sell SNS Neurons in 3 simple steps:

1. Transfer Internet Identity with linked SNS Neurons to IDgeek Smart Contract.
2. Unlink SNS Neurons to make them separate assets.
3. Transfer Internet Identity back to your device if necessary.

After unlinking, SNS Neurons appear on "My Assets" page and can be either
sold on IDgeek or transferred to another NNS/ICDEX account.

P.S. SNS Neuron also can be transferred directly from ICDEX.

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2023-12-21 11:01:52 UTC | #55

In the IC network, the voting rights of NNS are private property of individuals. In classical economics, private property and liberalism (the freedom of conservatism) based on the premise of not infringing on the private property of others are the innate rights of civilized people, and only in this way can the economy prosper and develop. The igeek market is very great and innovative, and it makes up for the stagnation of Dfinity's work in this area.

Selling neurons at a discount is already a punishment for individuals' property and freedom by the market. Why does the entire network governance still have the right to override the market and continue to punish these unsuccessful investors with fines (taxes)? The economics of IC should not violate the private property and trading freedom of individuals.

I am glad to see that the Dfinity developers are encouraging this igeek market. I have been in the IC network for almost two years. Although I have never sold or will not sell NNS neurons in the future, I have always hoped to see this neuron trading market earlier. Thank you to the great developer @alexeychirkov

The real wep3 is that the user can do whatever he wants. idgeek is a very successful project, I would like to see you again soon with much better features. I hope the next feature will be to sell our nns' special locked neurons separately.
