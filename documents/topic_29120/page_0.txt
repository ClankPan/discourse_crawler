Forum user "Newtolearn" was the first to point out that the $motoko SNS proposal was AI generated:

Please just tell me why can not using AI? AI is for helping us, No? Why are you so angry to a project that want to be a DAO? They rug you? You can vote no by yourself, I can vote YES since I believe it and I use real $ICP to buy real $motoko.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-03-30 09:04:38 UTC | #5

Using AI is much better than some guys that did bad thing such as making a coin on icpswap or sonic and attract ppl to trade and then run away. That really hurts the community.

-------------------------

Jamo4real | 2024-03-31 01:42:19 UTC | #7

That is a great new lfgüî•üî•

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-03-31 03:03:37 UTC | #8

I mean, maybe an AI could have written it but I could also see a human writing it.

I can vouch for it being legitimate though. I have DMs with the people behind the original $MOTOKO launch and they made this proposal.

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-03-31 03:08:02 UTC | #9

Also, there may be some misunderstanding.

The SNS parameters basically mean there is no fundraise, it's just being done to give the existing $MOTOKO tokens the ability to take over the management of their own canisters, and that's basically it.

It hurts no one and does almost nothing, so I'm not sure what reason anyone would have for opposing it.

I have ample evidence to the contrary which I can provide if the moderators allow it. You can find some of my points in the official Motoko Discord. Start here and read the posts from ‚ÄúICP Investor‚Äù.

Who are the people behind the original $Motoko launch that you are vouching for?

-------------------------

Henry_Suso | 2024-03-31 12:35:30 UTC | #11

My entire account as banned and all of my documentation gone because I disagree with Twitter influencers Accumulatingicp and Bobby o creating their own motoko token and sending it to the sns for no purpose. It was the follow up to the stack token project which was a direct rip off of sneed dao.

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-03-31 13:01:20 UTC | #12

Which account was banned? 

Why are you in opposition to the $Motoko SNS? 

What documentation/evidence do you have to support your position?

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-01 15:31:53 UTC | #13

**Exhibit A - @Accumulating.icp Front Running the $motoko Token Announcement:**

accumulating.icp is the owner of the wallet - *‚Äòstacking.icp‚Äô*:

https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/holder/3e95f5562382fb9a0c2f5eb41f4107d46ffa76256813b803f4168d9008fc4e06/summary

For 1.5 years the wallet had minimal trading volume. Then 2 weeks before the $motoko announcement, the wallet suddenly woke up:

**What was accumulatingICP buying *hours* before the token announcement?**

*Huge amounts of motoko NFT‚Äôs, 28 in total.*  

After a largely dormant wallet for 1.5 years, how did accumulatingICP time the token announcement to perfection?

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-04-02 18:01:54 UTC | #14

Let me get this straight.
You are attempting to dox an unknown wallet and just claim it is his.

You wont even dox your wallet to prove you hold a stake in motoko.

You're issue is personal with accumulating and has nothing to do with the sns sale.

Which by the way the sns sale cost the community 0 icp.

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-02 18:35:11 UTC | #15

The wallet ‚Äòstacking.icp‚Äô belongs to @Accumulating.icp. This is his PFP, isn‚Äôt it?
![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 19.18.20|690x388](upload://uRLbSLvUUiLyjKyVuVEW5KtBhIt.png)

@Accumulating.icp has yet to respond to any of my evidence. I will post exhibit B if he does not wish to rebut exhibit A.

-------------------------

bigbay | 2024-04-04 08:35:57 UTC | #17

How can someone reply when they‚Äôre already caught red-handed lol?
No one should be disillusioned into thinking that this is an altruistic project meant for the good of the IC community.
Apart from taking over the Motoko name, the big price in my opinion is the Motoko Royalties wallet which contains almost 9k ICP (currently worth just under $160k) at the moment, and counting.
The usual suspects even proposed a Motoko NFT marketplace all in a bid to take over this royalty wallet.
This all stinks in my opinion.
Wallet address is df45aa9740ce7998a13da95d5fa67335882393562f2cd8f67e8fdeb9cac86db2

Dfinity did not handle the whole $MOTOKO token situation well and Jon is just being pushed along into all of this because they know that he means well for the ICP community. The token should have been a simple drop to all Motoko NFT holder wallets, rather than the mess which we witnessed.

-------------------------

bigbay | 2024-04-04 08:58:03 UTC | #18

There was even an announcement on X stating that Memecake NFT marketplace was rebranding to Motoko Market. I mean, why so much desperation?

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-04 09:24:16 UTC | #19

@aiv has vouched for the parties involved. I‚Äôm giving him/them a fair chance to rebut before moving forward with the evidence.

-------------------------

charm | 2024-04-04 11:44:53 UTC | #20

accumulating.icp should give an explanation if he intentionally siphoned off the user's money this would be fraudulent

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-04 13:18:07 UTC | #21

@Accumulating.icp is refusing to respond. I opened this thread because he censored 6 of my comments in the OP. @aiv said he vouches for them. I‚Äôm waiting to hear more before I proceed.

This is the issue at hand. 

There is a small cabal trying take control of motoko. They don‚Äôt even code lol.

-------------------------

hehe | 2024-04-04 15:18:21 UTC | #23

Reject $Motoko SNS,please

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-05 17:50:17 UTC | #24

I'm sorry for being slow to respond!

For context, I'm not directly involved in any of this and only have limited knowledge in the situation. I've been having like ~50 meetings a week preparing ICPCC for the past few months, and it's very hard to keep track of all the activity within the ecosystem while you're heads-down building.

My understanding was that $MOTOKO was started by Accumulating.icp, with permission and support from DFINITY, as a community project to add some energy back into ICP NFTs. The Motoko collection was launched by DFINITY just as something fun, but they otherwise didn't have anything else planned for it.

I'm not sure why it's a problem for accumulating to buy Motoko ghost at any point, whether or not he was about to announce that he was creating a token for the NFT holders. This is Web3 and it's an open market, if he wasn't buying any Motoko that would have been a red flag that he didn't even believe in the project he was building.

There was no fundraise, no one added liquidity for $MOTOKO other than community members, and the deal between DFINITY and Jon was in place long before anyone started talking about a token for the collection or the price shot up. I was there when the Motoko collection launched and got one in the airdrop, I'd assume DFINITY would be the one with the wallet collecting royalties. I think Jon should be getting royalties, but that's between him and DFINITY so it doesn't involve me. I think he's friends with Dom anyways, so I'm sure he'll be fine.

I also bet DFINITY wouldn't have launched a token for the collection over legal reasons, so it's not like this would have happened unless someone from within the community stepped up to do it.

I've had casual friendly DMs with Accumulating for maybe over a year now. I think he first reached out after a Motoko Bootcamp event (I started those). We've also had one phone call.

He generally seems like a nice kid to me. Him and I actually respectfully disagree with each other on various topics like how SNS launches should be approached. For example, I think it's ok (at least pragmatic for now) for them to be used as fundraises, while he thinks they should pretty much only be used to decentralized an existing project.

He's so far on the "people shouldn't profiteer from SNS launches" spectrum, and him and I have argued about it enough times, that I personally find it hard to believe there is anything nefarious about his 0.01 ICP SNS launch for $MOTOKO.

Could I be wrong? Sure, anyone can be wrong!

Does this project involve me enough to care? Not really, I think I hold like 0.4 $MOTOKO.

If you look for reasons to be suspicious within Web3, you'll always find something and have lots of ways to waste energy about it. At the end of the day though, Web3 is about autonomy. Part of autonomy is just learning how to give less shits when stuff that doesn't involve you is happening.

Think something is a scam? Then just don't hold that asset, problem solved.

If you've been around here long enough, you eventually end up being wrong enough times to chill out a bit. There are Web3 projects I was 100% certain that were scams which ended up being massive opportunities, and vice versa. I find more value in building and focusing on my own decisions than pointing fingers and worrying what other people might or might not be doing wrong.

Hi, thanks for that. Didn‚Äôt want to proceed before hearing back. Can you let us know please if you still vouch for the parties involved before I present further data?

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-06 17:34:06 UTC | #26

I've said everything I wanted say and already spent too much time on this, knock yourself out!

Thank you. 

Can you please ask on of them to answer questions that are in the OP. Everyone is being ignored.
