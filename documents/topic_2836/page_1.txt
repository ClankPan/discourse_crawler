You can use the following code which has been altered to work for internet identity. Follow the commands in README under **Building**

Yes, click "Register with Internet Identity" below, but we are discussing how you need a biometric device, or biometric functions in your laptop.  How much does a "ubikey" cost, and what platforms does it work on?

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-06-11 05:15:40 UTC | #108

Can a yubikey or a phone be registered to multiple identities or just one?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-11 08:37:19 UTC | #109

You can register them to multiple identities. The user number is used to distinct between them.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-06-11 14:52:16 UTC | #110

Thanks for the update.

rdubs | 2021-06-12 18:46:50 UTC | #111

I'm getting an error when I try to register a new laptop. When I land on the new device page and enter my user number, nothing happens after I press continue. When I try to press continue again, I get an error that says "A request is already pending.". Is there a solution to this?

-------------------------

wyz | 2021-06-13 03:19:31 UTC | #112

why when I register the Internet Identity, there only option for usb key? there are windows hello of fingerprint on my laptop.
and from docs of Internet Identity, it says that you can use screen lock to rigister new device to login the Internet Identity, but still only option for usb key when I register,
why?why?why?
there is someone deal with it? it's problem about my device?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-13 14:59:52 UTC | #113

did you try different browsers? chrome is supposed to work best

-------------------------

bjoern | 2021-06-14 09:41:11 UTC | #114

Windows Hello is not supported at this point. This is a known problem and we are working to resolve it. The underlying reason is that Windows Hello does not support modern cryptographic algorithms.

i am having the same question as you, i am currently logging into my account with my mobile phone, but when i log in on my computer it only asks for a key connection, so it will be unstable if my phone is damaged, It's been stolen, or I upgrade to a new phone, what should I do?

-------------------------

shakespeare1212 | 2021-06-16 18:54:55 UTC | #117

Yes.  Is there a verified product / device list somewhere? If not I suggest that you create one soon.  If I am understanding the tutorials properly, I really cannot deploy or even use anything until I can get a bio-metric ID.  I run Windows 10, and I own a LG Stylio 4 cell phone. I'm stuck. I don't want to waste money on a new device unless I am sure that it will work with Dfinity and The Internet Computer.

-------------------------

shakespeare1212 | 2021-06-16 19:00:51 UTC | #118

"a security key" Like what?  What are some exact brands and models for Windows 10, in my case.

-------------------------

shakespeare1212 | 2021-06-16 19:04:32 UTC | #119

Thanks.  Please hurry. I may get a 25K developer grant tomorrow, but I would hate to have to say to them:  "We are going to sit back and wait 6 months for the ID situation to improve before we start our work."

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-16 19:24:58 UTC | #120

To get you unblocked asap, there are good odds that you can get your initial canister created and funded using your phone for the NNS. Additionally, any Ledger hardware wallet can install a [Fido app](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005198545-FIDO-U2F), in case you own one already.

Otherwise, Yubikey has many options for USB A or C ports, depending on what is more convenient. https://www.yubico.com/products/.

-------------------------

Cris83 | 2021-06-23 15:57:10 UTC | #121

Funny thing: I try to log in with my hardware wallet from 2 devices. 
Device A all good (WIN 10 Chrome).
Go to the device B, it recognize me BUT I am asked to add a new device using a new hardware wallet (Linux firefox)

Why the same hardware wallet is not working on 2 different machines?
Is the identity tied to the hardware wallet AND the browser of a specific device?

-------------------------

RMCS | 2021-07-02 23:37:04 UTC | #122

Is there any update on this issue? I really looking forward to this feature. For normal day users it’s not possible to login on pc / laptop because they don’t own yubikey.

-------------------------

TonyNguyen338 | 2021-08-08 02:06:49 UTC | #123

Same issue. Waiting new update. I'm stuck in my non-biometrics pc

[quote="Olaf, post:8, topic:2836"]

I think maybe I'm missing something? I've tried to register with Internet Identity on a number of browsers/platforms, with little success:

1. Android v9 / Chrome 92 --- successful
2. MacOS Catalina (10.15.7) / Safari 14.1.2 -- blank screen after "installing internet computer..."
3. MacOS Catalina (10.15.7) /  Firefox 72.0.2 -- blank screen. Debug page shows 400 Bad Request, "Specified ingress_expiry not within expected range"
4. iOS 14.6 / Firefox Daylight 35.0 -- "Your browser is not supported" message after "installing internet computer..."
5. iOS 14.6 / Chrome 92 -- "Your browser is not supported" message after "installing internet computer..."

..what am I missing here? I've used both [https://identity.ic0.app/ ](https://identity.ic0.app/) and https://nns.ic0.app/#/accounts (just in case).

-------------------------

wole | 2021-08-09 10:50:40 UTC | #125

*UPDATE*
For iOS: So I observed that FaceID on my iPhoneX was problematic/not working so naturally it seemed the problem was linked to that (i.e. Apple's FIDO/WebAuthn would need biometric reader on the device). I borrowed a friend's iPhone 8 with a working touch reader and I was able to get to the setup page (I didn't proceed further).

MacOS. My Mac is an older model without any biometric capabilities. I assume this is why it doesn't work, and I would need a yubikey or something like that.

-------------------------

adk51 | 2021-08-16 19:20:09 UTC | #126

I appear to be having the same issues as everyone else and it's incredibly frustrating. I went as far as to buy a security token on Amazon, hoping it would work. I got the Thetis FIDO2 security key. I added it as a recovery key using my computer, it allowed me to do that. It says it was registered successfully. So then i try to login, but the website tells me "the security key is not registered with this website". So I go back and try and add it again as a security key for account recovery, but then it tells me "you already registered this security key, you don't have to register it again" 

At this point, i'm just going to pray i don't lose my cellphone and get my money back for this security key that is apparently useless.

-------------------------

TonyNguyen338 | 2021-08-17 07:37:21 UTC | #127

Now you can use your phone to add new devices. It works on Hello Windows. I did it. I now use my phone and 01 laprtop + 01 PC. I'm waiting for when it can work out on Ubuntu 20.4 which I need to learn to build Dapp/website by tutorial.

I entered the ICP forum for the first time, and it feels great ！！！

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-08-17 14:28:38 UTC | #129

Try removing it as a recovery device and then adding it as a security key.

-------------------------

wole | 2021-08-18 10:17:40 UTC | #131

UPDATE 2: Also run into problems when local system time and IC time differ significantly. Worth checking if you run into this.

-------------------------

adk51 | 2021-08-18 13:47:14 UTC | #132

same result... a message that says "Try a different security key. You're using a security key that's not registered with this website." So then i select "i already have an anchor but am using a different device", go to that screen and attempt to login and when prompted for the security key, it gives me the message "you already registered this security key. you don't have to register it again"... I just keep going in circles unless there is something i'm missing.

dfx sdk can only work on linux and mac. but internet identity doesn't support linux..what????? this is not right.

-------------------------

Seed0 | 2021-12-08 09:39:25 UTC | #136

Coming back after 6 months to try to log into identity and use the app for staking. Still not resolved? Jeez...

BROWSER
Tried all browsers, always demands a security KEY...don't have one, which key do you recommend? No other ways? How is this planned to be resolved, not gonna be any adoption if things stay like this...

MOBILE
Managed to progress on my mobile (chrome browser) but was stuck on the anchor management page.

I can only add device or add recovery, or delete one of them, or log out, but then when I log back in, I come back to this page and I am stuck. Cannot get into the app.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks

Seed0 | 2021-12-16 11:48:18 UTC | #137

I now bought the Yubikey 5 NFC and I was able to come to this step. When I open in another window it says that the security key is not recognizable. Please help, how the hell does this work?

Hi there, @Seed0 .

I just saw this. I have escalated this to the team to see how they can help (there may be some operating system nuances).

-------------------------

Ang | 2021-12-17 01:18:10 UTC | #139

Have you been able to register an anchor id? Have you reviewed the instructions here?: https://smartcontracts.org/docs/ic-identity-guide/auth-how-to.html#_create_an_identity_anchor

Seed0 | 2021-12-17 08:42:37 UTC | #140

Thanks for your intervention Diego!

-------------------------

Seed0 | 2021-12-17 08:49:43 UTC | #141

Yes, absolutely. I have gone through all the documentation and guides. Bought the yubikey and did all the steps but it keeps bringing me back to the same place. Either to the managing devices screen on mobile, or "new device" screen posted above. The URL does not take me anywhere further. 

I use windows 10 and android 11 on mobile.

Ubuntu 20.04, I have no biometrics and no security key. How can I add my device? I created an anchor already from my ios with face id.

-------------------------

Siri | 2023-04-27 09:08:14 UTC | #145

I registered anchor 10024. Backed up seed phrase at September 2022.  But I can't login at present

I need same anchor. I don't want to miss..  I entered seed phrase correctly. Dfinty is responsible for this techniqual issue.. 


I had all screenshots records.. 
Please solve this..

-------------------------

Ang | 2023-04-27 14:01:54 UTC | #146

We are sorry to hear that you are having issues authenticating with your Internet Identity.

In order to best help troubleshoot your issue please double check that you are using the correct recovery phrase. 

The phrase consists of english words (english: in the past we’ve had issues where browsers automatically translated the seed phrase). Can you confirm all the words are english?

Are you sure that you're using the correct recovery phrase and correct anchor id? 

The first word of the recovery phrase always corresponds to your anchor ID. ie, the recovery phrase should begin with the anchor id. If your recovery phrase doesn't start with a number, then you copied it down incorrectly. 

If you are entering your recovery phrase and it says "incorrect", then you may have entered wrong, or saved it incorrectly. It is also possible the recovery phrase was removed by mistake, or someone else got access to your account and reset it for you effectively locking you out. 

As a best practice we recommend users lock their recovery phrase as a safety mechanism so that it cannot be accidentally removed without authenticating it, additionally adding a second back mechanism hardware key, and additional backup devices are suggested steps to avoid being locked out in case your primary device fails. 

If you are still having issues you can send an email to support@dfinity.org


Best,

-------------------------

Siri | 2023-04-27 14:25:21 UTC | #147

All words are in English only. If you want I can share phrase. After log in working, I can reset phrase. Please help me with this regard

Dear ICP family. I have  problem to access to the page to create account.
I tried to create ICP identity with my new computer. After entering the page to create, it pop up the text as I copied below.

ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT?

THANKS

This error happens typically when the user's system device clock time is not synced - i.e. too much in the future or in the past in comparison to the IC time. Generally users solve this by syncing their local time on their device so the device clock is accurately set to the current local time.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Thanks for your reply to help me to create internet computer identity.

After I sync the time, now it works fine for me. I can create new identity or recover my identity as well. This will not happen if we don't have ICP forum to discuss. Once again, thank you for your help.
