Been hacking away for a few weeks, and still hungry after those Taco NFTs? 

Take a break from hacking and come enjoy some tacos ðŸŒ®  and a beverage with the DFINITY team and members of the SF Bay Area IC Developer Community!

Looking forward to meeting you all in person and connecting during this casual happy hour occasion.
