Hello everyone,

We are now voting for the ICPanda DAO on the SNS, please vote for US:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128355

ICPanda is a decentralized Panda meme brand built on the Internet Computer.

Dapp on IC: https://panda.fans
Project: https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-panda
Whitepaper: https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-panda/blob/main/whitepaper/en.md
SNS initial parameters: https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-panda/blob/main/sns_init.yaml
Twitter: https://twitter.com/ICPandaDAO

## Main Offerings

### Lucky Pool System

Users can obtain PANDA tokens through airdrops for free, which allows them to participate in panda culture NFT creation and other Web3 activities without any barriers; users can also acquire PANDA tokens through lucky draws, ensuring a more equitable distribution of PANDA tokens.

### Panda Badges System

The panda badge is an image SFT (Semi-Fungible Token) officially produced by the ICPanda DAO. Users can purchase panda badges with PANDA tokens, allowing them to display their virtual panda identity on social networks, media streaming, and other Web3 platforms.

### Panda Culture NFT Creation And Trading Platform

Users can create and trade panda culture NFTs on this platform, which can be in various forms such as images, videos, 3D+AI virtual objects, etc. Users need to spend PANDA tokens to list their NFT works, which are priced in ICP tokens. Users can stake PANDA tokens to boost the exposure of other users' NFT works, and earn a share of the profits when those NFT works are sold.

### Decentralized and Open Panda Meme Brand Platform

This platform is built on the RWA (Real World Asset) concept, aiming to introduce panda culture and related brands from Web2 and offline entities into Web3, or bring original panda culture from Web3 to Web2 and offline entities. This includes but is not limited to the digital avatars of real pandas, panda culture merchandise, derivative movies, and games. The platform will promote the globalization of panda culture through online and offline open cooperation and traffic interchange.

## Token utility

PANDA is the only token issued by ICPanda DAO. By holding PANDA tokens, users can participate in:

1. Governance decisions of ICPanda DAO and receive rewards;
2. Purchasing panda badges;
3. Creation and trading of panda culture NFTs;
4. Activities on the ICPanda meme brand platform.

Another meme coin, I’ve never heard of.

-------------------------

zensh | 2024-02-28 15:42:39 UTC | #3

ICPanda is not just a meme token, it will be a genuine brand in the Web3 world.
We want to imbue it with real value and meaning, which will involve a lot of innovative R&D works.

A story:
A couple, where the man was very conservative.
The woman said, "If you don't sleep with me, I will sleep with someone else."
The man had a realization, slept with the woman, and later they got married.

------
Other layer 1 blockchains have a lot of meme tokens, and ICP will have them too.
Rather than letting others issue meme tokens, we might as well do it ourselves.

Our team has the best developers and product designers, and we are all in on Web3.
I am a Rustacean and ICPeans, and I really like ICP, all in ICP.

This is our first potentially viable Web3 project, and we hope to gain your support. :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

wikizhao52 | 2024-02-29 13:55:20 UTC | #8

We strongly believe in the potential of the Internet Computer. This year, our team is committed to building a truly decentralized application on IC for global users. Users will be able to use PANDA tokens on our platform to turn their valuable assets into NFTs, making them increasingly valuable. Pandas are not just a symbol of cuteness and beauty, but also a symbol of rarity and preciousness. Precious assets that are easily deleted or overlooked in the Web 2.0 world will be permanently preserved on our platform and passed down for generations.
We have the most professional team and the utmost passion to dedicate ourselves to building this venture on the Internet Computer.

-------------------------

slq016 | 2024-03-02 03:03:24 UTC | #9

 To be honest, I like your way of chatting, going straight to the subject and hitting the point of the problem. It's better than many ambitious dapp projects. Many of them are hypocrites.

-------------------------

zensh | 2024-03-02 03:15:27 UTC | #10

Thank you for the support.
We aim to create a panda meme coin that everyone in the real world will love, not for speculating on its price, but to integrate panda culture into everyone's life, bringing beauty to the world. We believe that with the empowerment of IC, all of this can be achieved.

tomimas1990 | 2024-03-02 23:07:19 UTC | #11

i might missing something here...but arent DAO coins generally always with no use case - except you pay for voting - and until you own really a lot, without value?

why are people buying into dao launches, i do not understand.

No, according to SNS, Governance decisions rewards SNS tokens, which are PANDA.

ICP is the transaction currency of ICPanda NFTs.

Antony | 2024-03-16 10:20:54 UTC | #18

I have a couple of points

1. Firstly, you mentioned that ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) doesn't have meme tokens, which is inaccurate
2. It appears that the community fund (CF) participation is indeed true. This represents a new approach compared to previous meme launches such as IC GHOST and SNEED. However, I'm concerned that this approach might convey the wrong message to the community and attract numerous MEME SNS campaigns, ultimately draining the community fund.
3. I haven't come across any information about this project previously. It seems like an airdrop out of nowhere.
4.  here seems to be a lack of a sensible roadmap and action plan.
5. The funding requirement seems too low for effective marketing, making it challenging to compete with other meme tokens in the market.

-------------------------

zensh | 2024-03-16 12:50:18 UTC | #19

Thank you for your message. The ICPanda project was launched on February 14, 2024. However, we have developed many other projects prior to this, and you can see a portion of our open-source work on our GitHub page. https://github.com/ldclabs

Our goal is not to create merely a meme coin, but rather a brand operation platform with a meme-like nature. We aim to integrate Web2 and offline brand operations into the Web3 space. In other words, it's about bringing Web3 to Web2 and offline brands.

The Internet Computer is an exceptional platform for Web3 entrepreneurship. If we succeed, I hope our success story can be replicated, attracting more Web3 entrepreneurs to the Internet Computer and ushering in a new model of entrepreneurship. Therefore, all the code for our ICPanda project is open source.

[/quote]

The whitepaper includes a simple development roadmap.
This design is based on my previous experience with Web2 project development and management.
I plan not to use the DAO treasury's ICP for marketing purposes but instead nearly 80% of the PANDA tokens towards achieving this.

Dear @Antony ,

It seems that you are an expert in security auditing. I have a question to ask:
Why can't I compute a module hash value locally that matches the one online?

Here are screenshots of my local calculation:
![image|690x81](upload://mivvqiaTsxGOOXasLKTjc9ghrSH.png)

And here is the screenshot of the online calculation:

I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
`shasum -a 256 .dfx/ic/canisters/ic_panda_luckypool/ic_panda_luckypool.wasm` is just right.

I mentioned the ICP Panda as a meme token in response to your earlier assertion about meme tokens on the ICP platform.

Without sufficient marketing, how can we expect to succeed and compete with meme tokens on other chains? I'm concerned that without a marketing budget, our project may become just another token on the IC platform, although it's acceptable for us since our focus is on building more products and launching tokens.

But again This will lead to launching a series of shit tokens via SNS.

-------------------------

wikizhao52 | 2024-03-17 13:07:00 UTC | #24

Hi, @Antony 
We fully understand your concerns regarding market operations.
I’d like to explain that we have designed a lucky draw pool feature in our product, where users need to pay ICP to get random PANDA tokens. Our project offers a lower barrier to participation, then focus on enhancing user engagement at the product level to earn ICP. The earned ICP will be considered for operational funding. This feature has the potential to raise up to approximately 200,000 ICP at its maximum limit.

-------------------------

Bevis | 2024-03-18 02:44:17 UTC | #25

The design of your token lucky pool is very interesting, but the valuation of SNS sales is too high. If the upper limit of sales is lowered to 12,000 ICP or 200 million ICP, it will become popular. The upper limit valuation of 60,000 has reached a market value of nearly 7 million U

-------------------------

zensh | 2024-03-18 03:01:25 UTC | #26

Your spelling might be incorrect; the fundraising cap is 60,000 ICP, which, at the current rate of 12.6U/ICP, equals 756,000 U.

-------------------------

Bevis | 2024-03-18 03:06:29 UTC | #27

Yes, I calculated it wrong, but it still feels a bit high. I don’t know if funds from the community fund will be used.

-------------------------

Bevis | 2024-03-18 03:16:05 UTC | #28


At what stage has the project development progressed? We still haven’t seen the implementation of the corresponding functions?

-------------------------

zensh | 2024-03-18 03:17:22 UTC | #29

Over half of the DAO fund's ICP will be used to provide liquidity for the DEX.
All ICP from the lucky pool will be used to provide liquidity for the DEX.

-------------------------

Bevis | 2024-03-18 04:56:41 UTC | #30

I'm talking about the total market value reaching 7 million U

Lucky pool canister is implemented
https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-panda/blob/main/src/ic_panda_luckypool/src/api_update.rs

The frontend will be online by proposal after SNS DAO finished.

The development of the Panda Badges System and NFT Platform will commence one by one after the SFT canister implemented.

[quote="Bevis, post:30, topic:27967, full:true"]

[/quote]

Yes, because 50% of the tokens will go into the lucky pool for lucky draws and free airdrops:
1. We can distribute tokens more fairly to more people;
2. The ICP revenue from lucky draws will also support the total market value.

-------------------------

Bevis | 2024-03-18 06:35:01 UTC | #33

If no one participates in the lucky pool, the team’s 4%+4% share accounts for 40% of the circulation, which is 4 million coins, and the remaining 6 million coins are invested by investors in real money.

-------------------------

[quote="Bevis, post:33, topic:27967"]

If the token price increases, there will definitely be participants in the lucky draw, as you can win a minimum of 1000 tokens and up to 100,000 tokens for 1 ICP.

-------------------------

Antony | 2024-03-18 09:17:35 UTC | #35

Where are you planning to create liquidity?. Will you create liquidity in both dexes (ICP Swap and Sonic)?

-------------------------

[quote="Antony, post:35, topic:27967"]

Yes, there's also ICLighthouse. However, our initial ICP is limited, so we will gradually create liquidity pools for this DEXs.

domwoe | 2024-03-18 11:52:59 UTC | #37

Hey @zensh,

I haven't looked at the project in detail but from what I understand the lucky pool will custody user funds. Do you have an external security audit of the contract code?

See DFINITY's voting guidelines for reference:

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:19543"]
Security aspects

* In general, it is considered to be best practice to conduct a security review including the fixing of risky findings. Guidance on security best practices is [here ](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/security/).
* Hence, a project should explain to which extent security reviews are relevant for the dapp and what kind of security reviews have been conducted for the dapp if applicable.
* Core functionality of the DAO should be open source.
[/quote]

-------------------------

zensh | 2024-03-18 12:07:00 UTC | #38

Hi @domwoe ,

The Lucky Pool does not custody users' funds but stores the funds of the ICPanda DAO, including:
1. 50% of the SNS tokens, which will be distributed to users through free airdrops and lucky draws;
2. The ICPs obtained through lucky draws, which will be regularly transferred to the DAO treasury. The source code can be found here:

https://github.com/ldclabs/ic-panda/blob/main/src/ic_panda_luckypool/src/api_admin.rs

I am interested in security audits and will engage with this knowledge. Future functionalities may involve security auditing.

-------------------------

wikizhao52 | 2024-03-25 13:46:58 UTC | #39

**Feature Update:**
Can’t wait to introduce the upcoming new feature - the Lucky Pool! We're currently in the testing phase, and we've successfully implemented all processes.

Here's what the Lucky Pool offers:
1. Airdrop: Every user who logs in can claim 100 FREE PANDA tokens - a welcoming gift from us to you! Moreover, you'll receive a unique lucky code. Share your link, and when others claim their airdrop, you earn extra rewards. People who fill in the lucky code for the free airdrop can receive 150 FREE PANDA tokens.

2. Lucky Draw: By spending a minimum of 1 ICP, you can enter a draw to win between 1,000 and 100,000 PANDA tokens - all at random.

All airdrop and draw transactions are meticulously recorded for full transparency.
