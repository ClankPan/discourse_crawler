Will Bots spamming huge transactions bring the whole ICP network down?

I brought this question up is because SOL network is down due to bots spamming 4m transaction per second. I'm wondering how ICP network will react if this attack was targeted at ICP ? I have seen in the past the subnet going down because of large transactions ? Can we totally prevent this kind of attacks?

Are you talking about this?

I think it really depends on how the developer architects their application.

During some of the NFT drops last year there was high traffic one the subnets was brought to a crawl, but it wasn’t close to 4mil/sec and I don’t believe it affected the network as a whole. Upgrades have been made since then, but 4mil/sec is still quite a lot.

I wonder if any usage of `inspect_message` would help in preventing such an attack?

I would love hear from the team working on boundary nodes with respect to this as well.

We should probably have a red team try this from time to time. It will depend on if they are query requests or update calls. I think there is currently a one second cache on query calls, so that should help some, unless the parameters are randomized.I assume the boundary nodes will just start dropping transaction at some point.
