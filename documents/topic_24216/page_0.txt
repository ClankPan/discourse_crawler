Hi,

Could someone give me a link to the documentation which defines how an SNS proposal is adopted?

I've noticed some proposals on DAO's pass immediately, which makes me think (hope) proposals will automatically pass if a certain voting power is reached.

If you could point me in the right direction that would be great.

The FAQ section at the support website covers this: https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/4489411106324-What-is-required-for-a-vote-to-pass-.

Alternatively, the ICP dashboard shows the same info right below the voting results of any NNS/SNS proposals - note the small info icons next to Absolute Majority and Simple Majority, e.g. https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/3e3x2-xyaaa-aaaaq-aaalq-cai/proposal/458.

Note that voting works in a similar way in NNS and SNS. SNS allows for a bit more configuration, e.g. voting period duration. We're currently working on increasing some acceptance thresholds in SNS which might be another difference - details [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-sns-ability-to-mint-sns-tokens-revised-thresholds-for-voting/23382).

Thanks Georgi, 

Exactly what I was after.
