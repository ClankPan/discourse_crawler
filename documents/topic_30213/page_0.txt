I have an update call on my backend canister but I want to make sure that only my frontend can call it or identify that the front end is calling it and reject any other case. Is this possible? I've seen there are other posts related to this but they were a little old so I thought I'd ask again to see if there are any potential new ways.

Thanks,

Freddie

You require the authentication of a principal (including your canister's principal) to access backend methods. 

However, you cannot confirm which principal AND a specific frontend a call is coming from. 

You can reference:
