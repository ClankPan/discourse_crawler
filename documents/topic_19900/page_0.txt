I read that only users and NNS canisters can hold ICP, and for this reason Wrapped ICP (WICP, caninster ID `o5d6i-5aaaa-aaaah-qbz2q-cai` was invented.

It is still true that only users and NNS canisters can hold ICP?

If ICP is now freely movable between canisters, what is the ICP canister ID?

No, all canisters on any subnet can hold ICP.
