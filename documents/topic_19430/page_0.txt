Happy Friday Everyone,

I have finished the architecture, and first draft for a Developer Grant Proposal we would like to send to Dfinity early next week.

It's a user facing app ideal for the IC, and it will use the new Bitcoin capabilities.

Before sending the application, I would appreciate any advice from Dfinity or from other Grantees who are here in the Forum. 

Diego @diegop could you please help us? I would really like to send the best possible Grant Application and build this DAPP on the IC. 

Thanks everyone.

@josephgranata I do not work in grants so my feedback would be generic. @domwoe above works in grants so his feedback would be the most helpful i think!

Thanks Diego, I will follow-up with @domwoe then.

Dominic, I am following the standard Startup Pitch desk that is usually recommended, so I have a deck with topics like:
- Our Mission
- The Problem
- Our Solution
- The IC's Advantage
- The Competition
- The Product 
- The Roadmap and Milestones

And the team and request for funding.

Does this make sense to what you expect, should a topic be included that is not there, or one be removed?

In the product I include architecture, major epics, and a roadmap for development.

Anyway, advice would be most appreciated since I am currently writing this from a draft I finished last week.

Joseph

This looks great. The only thing to add would be the team.

Looking forward to your application!
