Hi I'm Tom, and I'm really excited about the ICP network. I'm not a developer, but I'd love to do my part in any way I can..

I studied Film in Brussels and now work professionally in video (post) production. (Camera, Lighting, Editing, Collorgrading, VFX etc).

If anytime Dfinity needs anyone to film or edit a video, I'd be happy to help.
