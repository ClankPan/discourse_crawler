I am facing this error very often as it shows in this example, https://github.com/aliscie/odoc/blob/f5f14854a12ddfa661c61d78ba06909a4b8a7b39/src/frontend/pages/file_content_page.tsx#L87 

However, I previously faced a similar issue with another project and I solved it using `serde_json::from_str:` like this example, https://github.com/aliscie/autodox-old/blob/02bac8b2376bfdf6ee67d8c461d2a19ef2432151/canisters/backend/src/files/update.rs#L28C28-L28C48  despite it is not a very good solution. 

Any recommendation in order to solve this, please?
