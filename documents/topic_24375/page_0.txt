Hello,

I would like to develop a simple 3d space in Unity. In this space I would like to pull in NFT's with 3d assets hosted on ICP.

What is the easiest way to do this? Is there some sort of script I can copy and paste pointing to the NFT assets?

I plan on deploying these NFT's throught Toniq.io's self mint program.

Any information would be appreciated
