Hello,
I have a general knowledge question, likely easy to answer for veterans of this forum :) 

When I used `dfx new` to generate my project, it created the following architecture:

```
myapp/
├─ node_modules/
├─ src/
│  ├─ declarations/
│  ├─ myapp_backend/
│  ├─ myapp_frontend/
│  │  ├─ node_modules/
│  │  ├─ src/
│  │  ├─ package.json
├─ .env
├─ package.json

```

When I run `npm install` within the `myapp_frontend` folder, it appears to install the packages in the root `node_modules` folder (right under myapp).

I don't understand that and more generally, why do I need `node_modules` outside of my 2 canisters' folders (`myapp_backend` and `myapp_frontend`) ? Will any code outside of those 2 folders get deployed when I run `dfx deploy` ? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the IC works: if my app has 2 canisters, when I deploy them, are they grouped within some sort of single container or nah they're just 2 independant containers that happen to work closely together ?

Thanks a lot and sorry if this is trivial.

The location of `node_modules` is a decision of NPM (or whatever other package manager you might be using) and not related to any IC-specific tech.

When you run `dfx deploy`, the flow that happens is different for asset canisters than it is for other "backend" canisters.

- The first few steps are a normal process for frontend development and not related to the IC:
  - First the frontend is built and output to a `dist` folder
  - The dependencies in `node_modules` are used to build the UI
  - Once the UI is built, anything necessary from `node_modules` is already included in the `dist` folder
- Now we get to the IC-specific steps:
  - The asset canister is deployed (this is like a special backend canister that is included with DFX)
  - The static assets from your `dist` folder are uploaded to the asset canister after it is deployed

The two canisters are deployed independently from one another.

Thanks a lot for your answer. I think this was the missing part for me: I didn't know that the frontend could be built with files outside of its folder. I know, sounds dumb, but now I know :P
