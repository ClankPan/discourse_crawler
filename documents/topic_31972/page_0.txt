The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals this Friday, 2024-06-14. DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## Additional Notes

The Cycles Minting canister upgrade contains an upgrade argument, which lets it interact with the [Cycles Ledger canister](https://github.com/dfinity/cycles-ledger), so that the Cycles Minting canister can mint cycles and transfer them to Cycles Ledger.

## Proposals to be Submitted

Curious, what's the mechanism/use case by which the Cycles Ledger canister can ask the CMC for cycles?

@jasonzhu you should probably make it clear to everyone that the following 2 duplicated CMC proposal should be rejected. Thanks

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2024-06-16 16:39:49 UTC | #4

The CodeGov project completed reviews for the proposals and voted to adopt them. We voted to reject proposals [130397](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130397) and [130398](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130398) since they got submitted as duplicated given the issues at that time. You can find details on https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/168083459961697538699863191526193241390/81
At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.

The cycles ledger can't ask the CMC for cycles. We want people to be able to get by without a cycles wallet. For this, there needs to be a mechanism to turn ICP to cycles on the cycles ledger without using a proxy canister. For this, the CMC has a new function `notify_mint_cycles` basically does the same as `notify_top_up`, but instead of depositing the cycles to the target canister, it calls `deposit` on the cycles ledger to top up the user's account

This proposal 'only' configures the cycles ledger canister ID so that the CMC knows on which canister it should call `deposit`

With this configured, `dfx cycles convert` will start working

It looks like the memo may work in a bit different way than notify_top_up. It wants you to specify a memo i the notify_mint_cycles call.  What are the rules/spec here?  Do you just need to know the memo and make sure it matches?  Or does it need to be the owner of the account converter to a memo as is used other places?

-------------------------

Severin | 2024-06-24 11:45:19 UTC | #7

The rule is the memo needs to be the expected value. See also [the code](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/ed5ac23c31f0b3f4f8f817e75fff3323b02bb057/rs/nns/cmc/src/main.rs#L1307). This works the same as in `notify_top_up`, which does the [same thing](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/ed5ac23c31f0b3f4f8f817e75fff3323b02bb057/rs/nns/cmc/src/main.rs#L1225) with the memo.
