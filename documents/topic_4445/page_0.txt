error: dfx: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by dfx)

what I did

1) sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

which default to 0.6.26

[then realized motoko school recommend 0.7.0](https://motoko-school.medium.com/set-up-your-development-environment-on-windows-5a5590fab726)

2) DFX_VERSION=0.7.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

now I can't dfx

Iâ€™ve seen other Debian setups with the same issue, the best Linux flavour to use for the latest dfx version is Ubuntu 20.04 or higher.
