Here is the error I am getting. I simply created a boiler plate Motoko, React, II app, deployed it to mainnet, and want to delete and refund my cycles. Not sure what to do about the error below.


```
Installing temporary wallet in canister test_1_frontend to enable transfer of cycles.
Attempting to transfer 2980877079427 cycles to canister 3a2fd-paaaa-aaaap-abnna-cai.

Assuming that you are using `dfx canister delete canister_name --network ic` within the project root (where `dfx.json`) to delete the canister on `mainnet`:

1. What is the version that you are using?

2. Can you please run `dfx wallet balance --network ic` and advise how many cycles you have?

I just want to know to confirm if you do not have enough cycles or if you need to update your dfx (there was a known bug and a release is coming soon).
