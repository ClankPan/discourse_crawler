dfx 0.14.1

`dfx canister id main --network ic` - working
`DFX_NETWORK=ic dfx canister id main` - no effect

Probably there are other dfx commands where `DFX_NETWORK` is not supported

Turns out `DFX_NETWORK` is never supported - it's only set by dfx during builds. But we probably should support it
