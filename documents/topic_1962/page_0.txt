Hello everyone, 2 Part question.

What is the best way to import javascript I'm trying to port over a simple app 

https://github.com/ScaleDrone/javascript-chat-room-tutorial

First would something like that work on Dfinity 

second I have the HTML part working but would the script tags work  like the image
