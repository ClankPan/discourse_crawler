Firstly, apologies as I’m sure this question has been asked many times, but I can’t find an answer to my exact situation. 

I created an NNS Dapp account in December 2022, I staked a few ICP coins. 

The passkey was created on an older iphone, but saved on iCloud, I don’t remember storing the seed phrase (if I did, I can’t find it)

I now have a new iphone and was trying to log in for the first time since Dec 2022, and the “passkey” on my apple keychain does not seem to work. 

Given that I do not have the seed phrase, what are my options? 

I know the address to which I sent the ICP, as it’s on my Ledger Live record. 

I can see a “passkey” for The Internet Identity (ic0.app) under “passkeys” within settings.

Did you attempt to connect to both identity.ic0.app and also https://identity.internetcomputer.org/ you may have registered the passkey on a different URL. Did you try multiple browsers? Are you sure that you're using the correct identity number? You can send a support ticket to support@dfinity.org for assistance.

Hello,

I’m developing a Dapp on ICP, but the Internet Identity feature is giving me many problems. Is there a source of truth for creating an Internet Identity including the internet browser settings for success? Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari seem to have their own issue.. For example, I removed my pass codes for my 2 listed devices on the Internet Identity sign in screen. Now, I can’t access anything. I didn’t know what was g going to happen, but I didn’t expect the complete loss of use of my Internet Identity. Shouldn’t there be some kind of warning, or maybe like a way to prevent this seemingly simple error? I’m developing a Dapp with access provided to users via their Internet Identity, but if I’m having problems, my users will 100%. There has to be some hidden knowledge for this sort of thing that I can find a solution to all my issues I’m having. Please send help, thank you.

Best regards,
Jesse Hahka
