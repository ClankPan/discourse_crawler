Hey guys, trying to understand some aspects of internet computer here...

- Is it possible to obtain wasm binary code knowing just canister id or is it hidden information?
- Is it possible to obtain candid definition having just canister wasm code?

I'm interested in calling existing canister methods(query, update) from rust or go, but I don't have a candid file... And not sure about exact arguments and data types ..
What is the best approach?

Thanks!

Currently - I don't think so, but there were plans to make some of them public

Yes (most of the time). The interface definition is inside the canister metadata. Look for a canister at dashboard.internetcomputer.org and you will see its interface. 
There is also this library that helps with IF discovery - icblast <https://github.com/infu/icblast>
