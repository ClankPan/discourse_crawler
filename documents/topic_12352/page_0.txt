I just published a blog post that display how to call canisters in NodeJS.

If you notice anything that should be improved let me know. I plan to publish a follow-up that showcase how to install code in "children" canisters.

Btw. blog post itself was edited and is published on the IC with my upcoming blogging platform [Papyrs](https://papy.rs) ðŸ¤—.
