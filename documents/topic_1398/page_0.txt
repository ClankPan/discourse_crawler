Basically, when can I expect to get access to Sodium? I have Tungsten credentials, and I was emailed information about getting setup for Sodium. I submitted my principal ID in the form, but I haven't heard anything back yet. The email said that the first wave of developers would be admitted last Monday. I guess I missed that wave.

Are there going to be continuous waves on an interval? What can we expect?

Please be patient. We have not automated the on-boarding process yet and are still running final tests. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause! I expect many more applications will be processed over the next two weeks.
