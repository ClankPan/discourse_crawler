I hope the plug wallet updated something with new UI and everything.

After the update I'm getting a new errors and facing new challenges everyday as a developer to find the issue and to bring up the solution.

*Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'plug');*
I'm facing this error when checking the connection so I put a "question mark to avoid error",
const connected = await window?.ic?.plug?.isConnected();

I can't even initiate a transfer functionality using agent.icrc1_transfer(transfer_props);
Facing agent.icrc1_transfer() is not a function
I can see the all functions in console, icrc1_transfer is there.

I'm developing so much of apps on various kind of blockchain tech, most of my apps depends on plug only. How could I get rid of this error?
