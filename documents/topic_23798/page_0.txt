All the signs point to them rugging the community and I am not surprised at all. They obviously bought all the tokens themselves using hundreds of different wallets to meet the requirements. The IC community and Dfinity need to reflect on how to improve the SNS and protect the neuron funds from people like Seers. Good lesson learned but an expensive one.

osman | 2023-10-16 20:46:59 UTC | #4

SNS dao should learn from this theft incident and find ways to control it to prevent similar incidents from occurring in other projects. Until a better way is found, SNS DAO projects must be put to a vote by SNS DAO management before ballot proposals can be put to vote. Proposals that pass the SNS DAO vote must be put to the vote as the project's voting proposal.

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-10-17 06:22:22 UTC | #10

Developers of any other SNS DAO can do the same. They are limited only by good intentions. But people only have themselves to blame for trusting developers and following their "dev neurons", thus giving control to one entity. So we have nothing to complain about DFINITY. Each DAO and their members are responsible for themselves and their treasury funds.

Recently we proposed to the community to raise the acceptance thresholds for some proposals, treasury transfers being one of these - see the forum thread [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-sns-ability-to-mint-sns-tokens-revised-thresholds-for-voting/23382). It’s been under development but unfortunately it’s taking longer than expected. My current estimate for creating the upgrade proposals that implement these changes is Nov 2023.

In parallel, we’ve discussed internally some other measures that we can take to make SNS DAOs more rug pull resistant. Some of these are:

* Disabling following for treasury proposals
* Limiting the amounts that can be withdrawn for a period of time

Our plan is to do some more investigation on the topic in the upcoming weeks, come up with more ideas, and then have a community discussion before implementing anything. I’d like to thank [IC_Maximillion](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/IC_Maximillion) for starting the [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-effort-create-proposal-exclude-auto-vote-option-on-sns-treasury-related-proposals/23843) that captures ideas. I’d love to hear more ideas on the subject.

So far I’ve talked about technical solutions which are the building blocks of the SNS DAOs. However, as important as they are, they can’t solve all problems. Ultimately, the SNS DAOs are a type of social construct and as such rely on the interactions of individuals. For an SNS DAO to be healthy and successful, it should have an engaged community that is in constant contact with the DAO contributors (aka the dev team) and which applies social pressure to them.

Great to hear you are already working on it, Nov 2023 is not that late.

The measures you named above will be very helpful to raise trust to investors and the community, and give them a sense of comfort.
*Like CZ Binance did, when he came up with (Proof of Reserves) after the FTX crash*.

With the above mentioned measure alone:
* Disabling following for treasury proposals

E.g. if the majority mainstream users of a SNS game would hardly come through to check for voting, there still could be a orchistrated team (a hand full of voters with large ammounts of voting power) that could have a plan to drain the treasury or something in that direction. 
Lets make sure they can do anything but drain the treasury.

Im sure DFINITY and the community will come up with a **Double Secure Solution**, 
that cant be found on any other platform.

*Having easy access to tokens, worth millions of dollars, laying around in the treasury, can make the most honest devs fantasize.*

This is the correct answer. SNS is and never will be a magic bullet to prevent fraud and scams. It's just a tool developers can use to raise funds and eventually decentralize a project. People are asking more from the protocol then it can ever provide. 

People always need to do their due diligence and take accountability. There were plenty of red flags on BoomDAO and ICX. I will say it was a terrible look though for dfinity employees to endorse BoomDAO publicly however

After a stagnant investigation, identical actions have been repeated by BOOM DAO - an SNS dApp endorsed by multiple DFINITY employees, and the DFINITY Foundation themselves.

Action needs to be taken - the foundation can not repeat their previous fault of indefinite intentional ignorance, as showcased in so many subjects prior. 

This needs to be solved in a timely manner, otherwise you are leaving countless users vulnerable to exploitation of the faulty centralized system that is liquid democracy in isolation.

This passive “we’ll get around to it… eventually…” stance is going to leave us in a TERRA LUNA situation. And while the Foundation says it’s not a problem until we’re there - I’d like to see someone attempt to correct the TERRA LUNA event.

I'm confused what the problem is? I think it's sounds like a bunch of people crying about nothing. 
BoomDAO did exactly what they said they were going to do. I applaud them in removing ICP from the treasury neuron and staking it - I wish every SNS project would do more of the same. They also gave the BoomDAO Foundation 2-years of funds to make other strategic developments and investments in to their product. Again no problem that I can see as it's not the DAO's decision to decide where the funds go, it's the leaders of BoomDAO and that was expressly made very clear well in advance of Boom's SNS. So either people don't read or don't ask the right questions and therefore just gamble money(ICP) around the ecosystem.  

Maybe you have a different set of expectations to what the BoomDAO project is or isn't, but that's not Boom's fault, that person's fault is Accumulating.icp's fault.

You mean other than the fact that they extracted 80% of an SNS DAOs Treasury in a Lump Sum, executed the proposal within 3 minutes, allocated 100x funding for themselves over liquidity pools, and claim that 80k ICP is enough to “build the future of gaming” while they had to take 320k ICP for basic tooling that was already in existence? 

Seems real sustainable, thank God they’ve allocated less than 1/3 of what they took to a Neuron! If you do basic math you’ll quickly realize that the Neuron won’t regain the full 320k ICP even after 8 years staked compounded.

I’m not going to entertain this ignorance further, I’m just going to state that I’m beyond concerned for the future of ICP as a blockchain if your mindset of careless-ness continues to cultivate amongst others.

jwarner | 2023-10-25 19:53:11 UTC | #29

It's in their whitepaper that they were going to use 80% of funds for roughly 24 months of development. I don't agree with how they did it, but it was in the document. Whether they pulled it all out now, or slowly drained it over 24 months doesn't make a difference in my mind.

Also, I haven't seen a lot of people who actually bought into the DAO complaining about what is happening with their funds. There might be some, but they don't seem as vocal as the people complaining who didn't even invest in it. U.S. residents were blocked from participation, so maybe that has something to do with it.

JaMarco | 2023-10-25 20:52:45 UTC | #30

If they were sincere about just wanting a payday for themselves and not RUG, then why would they withdraw a large amount of money at this point in time? What is more, if they are just paying wages, why do they not withdraw the funds once a month or once a quarter, but advance the funds all at once?

There is one BIG disadvantage to letting canisters hold neurons and that is neuron markets that have the ability(note: not a guarantee, but a valid attack vector) to break the fundamental assumption of NNS governance: "skin in the game".  I've written ad nauseam about it elsewhere and won't repeat the arguments here.

But there is no reason that you can't let whitelisted canisters hold them.  Blackholed and/or DAO Horizoned canisters should be able to hold neurons.  This does not seem like a difficult feature to add given that a new proposal type mirroring named neuron could be added that stores whitelisted canisters at an address and at https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/e89564adda6ca8588f29780d9dfd7b8512e19f8c/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L2037 you could update to. 

```
   if !neuron.controller.unwrap().is_self_authenticating() and !canister_whitelist.contains(neruon.controller))  {
```

You could even auto-add SNS-controlled canisters to the whitelist without a proposal by verifying that they were only controlled by the SNS.

@lara @bjoernek 

Have you all considered using existing features built into neurons with the Neuron Management proposal topic?  It is possible to [create a decentralized neuron](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-create-a-decentralized-community-neuron/12564?u=wpb) as taught by @bjoern that doesn't have a known private key and can only be controlled by Followees for the Neuron Management proposal topic.  That topic can control all features of a neuron except dispersing the ICP in the neuron.  Hence, once the ICP goes in as a stake, then it can never come out (unless it is a non-profit neuron).  However, the Neuron Management proposal topic can be used to spawn child neurons from maturity of the parent neuron and assign principal IDs to the child neuron.  If an SNS intends to use maturity to fund ongoing development, then perhaps an 8 year neuron is sufficient to meet the needs.  

Part of the plans to create an SNS could be to either elect or propose a slate of up to 15 Followees for the Neuron Management proposal topic.  Hence, if funding is requested from this neuron, then it would be up to the Followees of the Neuron Management proposal topic to Adopt or Reject the proposal.  An entire SNS community could not vote directly on a proposal to spawn a neuron from maturity of the decentralized neuron, but they could elect representatives (who are doxed and background checked) to perform this task.

Also, from an NNS voting perspective, @christian has provided an example of how to enable automatic voting of a decentralized neuron based on canister control from a hotkey configuration.  The Taggr neuron votes on NNS proposals based on the results of polls conducted in Taggr.  The Taggr canister is a hotkey for the Taggr neuron, which enables the canister to vote on proposals.  [Here](https://taggr.top/#/thread/25520) is the discussion thread from when that idea was developed.  I believe he has already made the canister code for triggering the votes open source.  

In the Taggr case, Christian essentially black holed control of the Taggr neuron by removing all Followees from the Neuron Management proposal topic after it was configured.  That was done because the intent of the Taggr neuron is only voting and there is no desire the change that configuration in the future ever.  In fact, if ICP was ever deposited into the Taggr neuron, then maturity would build forever and could never be extracted since there are no Followees for the Neuron Management proposal topic and there is no known private key to control the neuron.

In the case of an SNS, I think the best configuration that could be achieved for decentralization would be to form the neuron without a known private key, assign up to 15 Followees to the Neuron Management proposal topic who are elected by the SNS community, configure Followees for each NNS proposal topic, add a canister hotkey for controlling voting on NNS proposals, set the neuron to 8 year dissolve delay, and then stake all or a portion of the SNS treasury.  The SNS team could propose a fraction of the token swap that should be allocated to an account for easy access and a fraction that should be allocated to this long term treasury neuron.  The neuron could be set up this way before the SNS token swap and funds could be automatically deposited into the neuron based on the proposed allocation.

This doesn't seem like it would take much development because all the features of the Neuron Management proposal topic, spawning neurons from maturity, and hotkey control of neuron voting already exist with all neurons.  The only development that would be required is integrating it into the SNS design in a trustless way.  This type of approach could also be used with existing SNSs, but there are a few trust requirements in getting the ICP form the current SNS treasury to an ICP account and then to a decentralized neuron.  If an SNS team is transparent of their intent with their community, then perhaps they could convince them of this plan in advance so they don't receive a lot of community backlash during the transition.

Anyway, it's just an idea.  It could be that SNS teams don't believe that their long term development efforts can survive off maturity alone.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-10-28 16:26:24 UTC | #40

An alternative to the configuration described above is to use 2 neurons to accomplish the same goals described above while still retaining full NNS control of the SNS treasury.  One neuron would be the decentralized SNS neuron with up to 15 Followees for the Neuron Management proposal topic and hotkey control of NNS voting by an SNS canister, but this neuron would not contain the treasury as a stake.  The other neuron could be called the SNS endowment neuron and would contain the SNS treasury, but would have a private key controlled by the NNS and would be configured with the decentralized SNS neuron as the Followee for the Neuron Management proposal topic.  In this way, the decentralized SNS neuron can control all aspects of the SNS endowment neuron except having the ability to disperse the ICP.  They can set Followees on all proposal topics (e.g. configured to follow the decentralized SNS neuron) and they can spawn neurons from maturity of the SNS endowment neuron (assigning any principal to the child neuron).  If anything goes wrong with the SNS, then all the NNS needs to do is revoke the Followee setting for the Manage Neuron proposal topic of the SNS endowment neuron, which it can do since the NNS holds the private key.  Since the original stake of the SNS endowment neuron came from funds raised in the SNS token swap, those funds could be easily returned to the neuron fund and the swap participants.

These functional features exist in all neurons today.

First İC-x and then Boom dao withdrew the resources in the treasury with a vote. The reason for both is the purchase of services. that is, software service, marketing and advertising service. Apparently, SNS DAO has not established any procedure for receiving service. If SNS dao is also related with these treasure dumping incidents, this is organized theft. If not, SNS DAO should urgently create a service purchasing procedure for its projects. For example, the institution or person that will provide the service locks up tokens equal to 6% of the service fee and puts their proposal to vote. If it passes the vote, it receives 30% of the service fee in advance and after completing the service, it runs the service delivery procedure and receives the remaining service fee after it is accepted from the dao vote. The service provides the necessary service free of charge when used for 1 year. At the end of 1 year, the %6 guarantee is automatically resolved and returned to the service provider.
A procedure similar to this should be implemented urgently.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-10-28 18:56:50 UTC | #42

If I'm understanding your suggestion correctly, and the SNS intends to support development services on maturity from a treasury neuron alone (which would be sustainable funding), then the decentralized neuron mechanism that I tried to describe could be the procedure you are interested in implementing.  For every withdrawal for services provided, it would require a proposal to spawn a neuron for the amount of that withdrawal and it would require majority voting by the doxed and elected Followees of the Neuron Management proposal topic of the decentralized SNS neuron to approve that proposal.  

If the SNS intends to support development services from the capital in the treasury (which would deplete the treasury over time), then some other method needs to be developed.  That could be developed by DFINITY and integrated into the SNS framework or it could be developed by individual SNS teams if canister controlled neurons were permitted (e.g. see the post by @skilesare).  

I agree that more controls need to be placed on how and when SNS treasury distributions can and should be executed and there needs to be a sense of urgency about it.  I see decentralized neurons and/or endowment neurons as a reasonable quick fix that might make a good permanent fix, especially if they can be integrated into the SNS framework in a trustless way.

oh he wants more control now after his friends drained the treasury


I sympathise with Wenzel, truly a victim here.

-------------------------

osman | 2023-10-28 19:34:36 UTC | #44

As a principle, I wrote that withdrawing money from the treasury should be followed by a solid procedure. If you remember, in the İC-x project, a proposal was put to vote to withdraw 150,000 İCP for software development and marketing issues. In other words, they withdrew 150,000İCP without following any rules. THIS shooting shouldn't be this easy without any obligation.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-10-28 20:35:41 UTC | #46

Is there something I wrote that makes you think I disagree with what you are saying?  The idea behind a decentralized SNS neuron and/or an SNS endowment neuron that holds the treasury is to create a solid procedure for making distributions and to enable that procedure to be executed in smaller chunks after services are provided.  I think that is in alignment with what you are suggesting.

In parallel, we’ve discussed internally some other measures that we can take to make SNS DAOs more rug pull resistant. Some of these are:

* Disabling following for treasury proposals
* Limiting the amounts that can be withdrawn for a period of time

Our plan is to do some more investigation on the topic in the upcoming weeks, come up with more ideas, and then have a community discussion before implementing anything.

I'm really curious how many people who invested in these projects feel like the funds were actually stolen, or that the contract they agreed to was actually breached? Have any of them contacted the local authorities to report the "theft", or consulted with a legal expert regarding the contract?

I think safety measures are great, and there are some good ideas in this thread, but as you can see by looking at the current regulations in the U.S., sometimes you stifle innovation under the guise of "protecting investors." In these two specific instances (ICX and BoomDAO), I'd like to know how many actual investors in those projects feel like they need more protection?

-------------------------

icpp | 2023-10-29 03:50:29 UTC | #49

I kind of feel like that too. These SNS projects are all very early projects, driven by the devs, and I am inclined to follow the devs that I trust. Always a gamble, but trying to hamstring the SNS DAOs with all kinds of rules that prevents spending the investments towards innovations will be counterproductive. 

I also do not like the idea of turning the SNS into a grant or contract style process to spend the money. That will also slow down progress. 

For more mature projects it makes sense, but not for these early stage projects.

The SNS isn’t securities right?

The issue is initial allocation of tokens.

Teams shouldn’t be able to allocate tokens to themselves. 

The SNS is a decentralized autonomous organization tool but we all are so greedy we throw away the decentralized part for profit and created scams.

If you're referring to securities in the U.S., I don't know about ICX, but BoomDAO geoblocked and put in their white paper that U.S. Citizens could not participate. So theoretically, no one in the U.S. should have been harmed.

lara | 2023-10-30 09:05:36 UTC | #57

Thanks for the ideas! I don't think we have explicitly looked at this approach before.
Just some initial thoughts:

As you say, this would mean that 
> once the ICP goes in as a stake, then it can never come out 

I am not sure if this is what SNSs would want for their NNS neurons. For example, if some SNSs would like to stake some ICP just for a year and then later use them for other things.

I would propose that before we decide on any development, it would be best to also compare this to other potential solutions, for example where the SNS controls the NNS neuron a bit more directly (e.g., via SNS proposal).
As you say, maybe the development investment would not be very large in your solution. I wonder whether this can also be true for other solutions. Moreover, I wonder whether using the manage neuron proposals is the easiest for end-users to understand as it is a bit a complex mechanism that requires understanding some details of both neurons and proposals to fully grasp.

I agree this is a challenge.  I assume SNS teams would be up to the task since they are developers.  I also assume a UI could be created to make this more user friendly.

> I assume SNS teams would be up to the task since they are developers.

You might be right. However, I think in the best case we can find a design where all actions (or as many as possible) are understandable also by the end-users as otherwise they need to trust the developers (which is against the idea that no centralised trust is needed in the DAO). 
But I agree that a good UI and some additional explanations can go a long way!

[quote="georgi, post:15, topic:23798"]
Ultimately, the SNS DAOs are a type of social construct and as such rely on the interactions of individuals. For an SNS DAO to be healthy and successful, it should have an engaged community that is in constant contact with the DAO contributors (aka the dev team) and which applies social pressure to them.
[/quote]

Maybe firstly we just update following topic: "All Topics" to "All Except Motion, and Transfer SNS treasury funds"?
I would argue that if our long-term goal is decentralization as community influence on developers, this can only be done through Motion proposals (presenting the will of the people, like referendums) and control over their access to treasury funds (partially payments for completed milestones, as it works in the case of e.g. the EU National Reconstruction Plan after COVID-19).
The long-term development plan should be detailed and included in each subsequent proposal to create an SNS-DAO, and the community should be able to independently assess its implementation and decide on cash flows to developers.

I thought I had tried to test participation through the NNS and it said I was blocked, but it's possible I was mistaken if it was not included in the payload. 

In my mind, using a real world example, it's like posting a no trespassing sign at the edge of your property, but not putting up a fence line. Is the sign alone enough? Some people think so, some don't. :man_shrugging: I think telling people they can't participate is enough, then let them decide whether or not they want to ignore that at their own risk.

Yeenoghu | 2023-11-01 18:18:29 UTC | #65

yeah I agree. I am one of those that thinks the sign is enough in relation to property. however here we are talking about money. So not utilizing parameters specifically included for such blocks is like saying "we dont want you but we are glad to accept your money"

charlesm | 2023-11-02 03:03:25 UTC | #68

-------------------------

charlesm | 2023-11-02 03:14:07 UTC | #69

It looks like old SNS proposals don't display the payload. Probably the change from the 2 proposal flow to the 1 proposal flow. Modclub and Kinic also geoblocked many countries but it's not shown in their payload either cuz they used the old flow. Nuance and Sonic are the only ones who used the new flow

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-11-02 17:17:35 UTC | #70

You are correct the US was blocked from participating in the Modclub SNS. You can view restricted countries by calling the governance canister method `get_sns_initialization_parameters` and reviewing the section `restricted_countries:`.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-11-02 21:35:47 UTC | #71

If that is the case then there is a bug that needs to be addressed as i am from a country that was supposedly banned in the Boom swap yet i have tokens and neurons from that swap.

The error is mine as I often only review the payload and skip a lot of the TL DR. When I didnt see any restriction in the payload of the proposal i purchased during the swap. 

If I was able to so then so were others.

jonit | 2023-11-03 10:45:17 UTC | #72

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-11-03 12:00:45 UTC | #73

I believe that the restriction is based on the participant's IP address geographical location.
Possible cause (other than using VPN or HTTP(S)/SOCKS Proxy) then might be that location of your IP changed - previously was in a non-restricted country - and GeoIP database that is used by NNS was not updated and needs refresh (DFINITY), for example:
https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/updating-databases

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-11-04 00:30:50 UTC | #74

No VPN or Proxy but my IP did change recently since i closed on another house in Sept and moved into it. But it shouldn't have changed my geolocation much as I can look out my window and see the other house.

Yup, it's not so much about your real geographical location - ISP (the one who provides you internet service) usually obtains a 'basket' of IP's (including the one you have) so location of the networks can change - KYC would be more exact for such verification, but also would be much more limiting.
ICP had a plans with `People Party` - that might be best compromise - but no idea about the current status.

Easier explanations of the proposals would be great for end-users like myself. I don't always understand the code trees as I have no coding experience and the summaries can be sparse. I have been using ChatGPT to explain it to me which has been a big help. I saw Dominic post something about an AI on ICP, is there a way to integrate a linguistic AI like ChatGPT to create accurate summaries of code and proposal details?

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-11-27 03:50:16 UTC | #83

Cool idea.  Can you give some examples of how you use ChatGPT for this?  Do you ask it toe explain the entire repo or a diff between two commits, for example, and what do typical chatgpt prompts for this look like?

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-27 04:44:22 UTC | #84

 Here is what I prompt it with:

"This code is from a proposal titled “Assign Node Operator ID (NOID)”:

{
“ipv6”: null,
“node_operator_principal_id”: “xbvdm-vrdwg-wcvpo-dwsdp-akpmo-sresk-53cg5-mwpn3-adhco-rwzym-gqe”,
“node_allowance”: 1,
“rewardable_nodes”: ,
“node_provider_principal_id”: “3oqw6-vmpk2-mlwlx-52z5x-e3p7u-fjlcw-yxc34-lf2zq-6ub2f-v63hk-lae”,
“dc_id”: “li1”
}

What does this code do and what does it mean in the greater context of the IC?"

This is the response: "The provided JSON object is part of a proposal titled “Assign Node Operator ID (NOID)” within the context of the Internet Computer (IC). Let’s break down the key components:

1. **`"ipv6": null`**: This field appears to be the specification for the IPv6 address associated with the node. In this case, it is set to `null`, indicating that there is no specific IPv6 address provided or that IPv6 is not relevant for this proposal.
2. **`"node_operator_principal_id": "xbvdm-vrdwg-wcvpo-dwsdp-akpmo-sresk-53cg5-mwpn3-adhco-rwzym-gqe"`**: This is the unique identifier assigned to the node operator. Each node operator in the IC network is identified by a principal ID, and this ID uniquely identifies the entity responsible for operating the node.
3. **`"node_allowance": 1`**: This field specifies the allowance or the number of nodes that the operator is allowed to run. In this case, the operator is allowed to run one node.
4. **`"rewardable_nodes": []`**: This array is currently empty, indicating that there are no specific nodes listed for rewards in this proposal. It might be relevant in the context of reward distribution based on node performance or other criteria.
5. **`"node_provider_principal_id": "3oqw6-vmpk2-mlwlx-52z5x-e3p7u-fjlcw-yxc34-lf2zq-6ub2f-v63hk-lae"`**: This is the principal ID associated with the node provider. The node provider is the entity that provides the physical or virtual resources for running the node.
6. **`"dc_id": "li1"`**: This field specifies the data center identifier. Each node is associated with a specific data center, and this identifier helps in organizing and managing nodes within the broader network infrastructure.

**Meaning in the Greater Context of the IC:**

1. **Node Operator and Provider Identification:** The proposal is assigning a Node Operator ID (NOID) and Node Provider ID to a particular node. This is crucial for tracking and managing the responsibilities of different entities within the IC network.
2. **Allowance and Resource Allocation:** The “node_allowance” field indicates the number of nodes that the operator is allowed to run. This is part of the broader governance and resource allocation mechanisms within the IC, ensuring fair distribution and utilization of network resources.
3. **Reward Mechanism:** The presence of the “rewardable_nodes” array suggests that the proposal may be related to rewarding node operators based on their performance or other criteria. However, in this specific proposal, the array is empty, indicating that there are no specific nodes listed for rewards.
4. **Data Center Assignment:** The “dc_id” field associates the node with a specific data center. This is important for managing the geographic distribution of nodes and ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance in the network.

In summary, this proposal is about assigning identification, allowances, and provider information to a node operator within the Internet Computer network. It plays a role in the governance, resource allocation, and operational aspects of the decentralized infrastructure."

This is very useful when it comes to making an informed decision. If every proposal had this info or integrated an AI response like this. It would greatly empower individual voters to make more informed decisions and not blindly follow neurons to do voting for them.

I agree that ChatGPT can help explain the mechanics of Node Admin proposals (and other proposal topics/types), but that's only one part of what it means to make an informed decision on this type of proposal.  There is a node provider onboarding work process and an ongoing node optimization effort that was passed via NNS Governance Motion [proposal 125367](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125367) that also needs to be considered.  Making an informed decision on these proposals requires being able to check the details of the proposal against these other criteria to make sure they are consistent and compliant with the overall strategy.  I'm not aware of anyone in the ICP ecosystem other than DFINITY who is currently reviewing and casting informed votes on Node Admin and Participant Management proposals, but if there are people who are interested in this task then I'd like to chat.  I think we could build the capability to perform these kinds of reviews within CodeGov project.  In my opinion, people should get paid bounties for performing this kind of work because it is a non trivial time commitment, requires attention to detail, and requires a technical understanding of the work process.  Review and approval of Node Admin and Participant Management proposals seems like a good way for the community to help share responsibility of advancing decentralization of ICP, but only if voting on these proposals really is intentional and informed.

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2023-11-27 09:02:03 UTC | #86

I believe that Chat GPT can help reduce work, but I have also seen it make plenty of plausible-looking but deeply wrong statements, so real humans doing due diligence is essential.

I definitely agree that being a diligent voter is no small task. There definitely ought to be some compensation. I feel like the Known Neuron status could be a bit more standardized perhaps. By that I mean, completing reviews publicly and maybe even recording videos like you’ve done with CodeGov @wpb. I’ve watched your YT video on the CodeGov website and that was very helpful to understand what CodeGov is all about. Now while everyone may not be comfortable with showing their face in a video and recording, take @Accumulating.icp for example. I haven’t seen anyone do what he does with the SNS proposals, and I’m sure that takes a lot of time. I like the Known Neuron process as it is but I feel like there could be a way to strengthen the visibility of what Known Neurons intentions and thoughts are on different aspects of the IC as there are new proposals coming at such a high pace.if I’m going to follow a vote, I want the best of the best and searching the forums and vpGeek can be a task in itself. Otherwise, I’d like to make the vote myself. But as you said, it requires a deep knowledge of the inter workings of the IC and what has already been done before. While I feel like I have a good understanding of how things work, there are people who have been in the community longer than me with way more VP that I feel it’d be better to leave it to them.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-11-27 17:32:36 UTC | #88

Thank you @ckMood.  I appreciate your kind words and agree with your perspective on how to be diligent with voting and Followee selection.  One feature that I believe is really cool about neuron Followee configuration is that we can all set different Followee(s) for each proposal topic.  Hence, if you trust one Followee(s) for SNS and another Followee(s) for Governance and another Followee(s) for Replica Version Management and another Followee(s) for Node Admin and yet another Followee(s) for everything else, then it's easy to configure your neuron in that way.  In fact, you can follow multiple Followees for the same topic as long as you are confident that they will always vote on that topic.  Governance and SNS do not fall under the All Topics catch all, which means you do have to explicitly set a Followee(s) on those topics if you don't want to vote manually.  However, all other topics are covered under All Topics.  The Followee(s) you set for All Topics will cast your vote on all other topics UNLESS you explicitly set a Followee(s) for a specific topic, in which case that explicit Followee(s) will cast your vote on that proposal topic.  I suspect you know all this, so I may just be writing this out for new members of the ICP community or people who are less familiar with neuron configuration options.  You started such a good discussion in this thread that it felt like a good place to provide this additional information.

[/quote]

It may not be obvious, so I thought I'd explain how CodeGov makes our reviews public.  We have focused our reviews on Replica Version Management proposals since April, but have recently started verifying System Canister Management proposals as well.  Each week, DFINITY starts a forum post before they submit a replica update proposal to the NNS.  This enables them to provide a link to the forum for discussion in the proposal.  The CodeGov team adheres to a 2 day self appointed deadline to complete our reviews and post them in the CodeGov portal on DSCVR, which can be found [here](https://dscvr.one/p/codegov).  Hence, for every proposal, you can find the full review completed by each team member of the CodeGov project.  After all reviews are complete, I will typically summarize our findings and post them on the forum in the thread that DFINITY started.  Unfortunately, there is not a forum category dedicated to these proposals.   However, most of them can be easily found by filtering forum posts with the tags [Replica](https://forum.dfinity.org/tag/replica) OR [Release](https://forum.dfinity.org/tag/release).  If you scan through either list, you will see that CodeGov routinely provides a summary of our decision and a highlight of any questions, concerns, discrepancies that we found.  There has actually been a lot of feedback between the CodeGov team and the change owners at DFINITY on these reviews.  Any time you see comments from me, @ZackDS, @Zane, @cyberowl, @ilbert, @massimoalbarello, @tiago89, @Gekctek, or @Icdev2dev in a forum post that has these tags, then it likely in the context of work they are doing as a reviewer for the CodeGov project.  We have been relatively active and public with our reviews and independent voting on these proposals.

I agree.  @Accumulating.icp does an impressive job with his SNS due diligence.  I may not agree with everything he concludes, but I certainly have a lot of respect for the work he has produced as presented on the forum.  It's amazing how much time and effort he puts into them.  I actually wish there were several people or organizations in the ICP ecosystem who were willing to put in similar levels of effort.  It is a challenge to sift through all the information available for each SNS, so I believe it would be helpful if there were multiple independent and objective reviews of these SNS projects and their decentralization sales.  So far @Accumulating.icp is the only individual who has decided to provide this service to the ICP ecosystem.  I think it is too much work for people to do as a volunteer.  Hence, if we ever want additional people or organizations to perform this work in a professional manner, then it will likely need to be incentivized.  I see this service as another public good for the ICP ecosystem.
