been trying to get exchange rates from the xrc exchange rate canister (at uf6dk-hyaaa-aaaaq-qaaaq-cai) and I keep running into problems.

even running the example command explicitly mentioned in the docs (at https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/exchange-rate/exchange-rate-canister#calling-the-xrc-directly ) gives this error:
![image|690x133](upload://8CKDPLRES6ecZWflzmZCboytwip.png)

Any and all advice on how to call the exchange rate canister properly from either my terminal and/or from my canister code (written in Motoko) will be very appreciated!

You local time is off by ~6 minutes, sync it in OS settings and it should work again.

of course...
I'm using VM to run dfx on windows that's why the local time was off.
Thanks, after many different errors it's finally working as expected :slight_smile:
