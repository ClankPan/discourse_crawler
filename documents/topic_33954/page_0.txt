Hi everyone,

I'm working on a project with Rust as the backend and React as the frontend in the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem. I need some guidance on the following:

1) Are there any packages or wallets that support ICP canisters and can convert:
      a. ETH to ckETH and vice versa
      b. BTC to ckBTC and vice versa

Your insights and recommendations would be incredibly valuable and much appreciated. Looking forward to any tips, tricks, or experiences you can share to help.

Thank you so much!

Hi Shreya, welcome to the community!

For your project involving converting between ckBTC and BTC, as well as ckETH and ETH, you might find the following example useful:

I have created a ckBTC wallet using `ic-reactor/react`. You can check it out here:

The process for ckETH is very similar. For such simple conversions, you don't necessarily need a backend. The frontend can handle interactions with the canisters effectively.

Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!
