GPT was train on Azure supercomputer with 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server
Is possible train GPT on Internet Computer net  ,  with much less than 175e9 parameters?
I see problems: each node is one or several CPU, no GPU
network connectivity is very very slover as the worls inernet
