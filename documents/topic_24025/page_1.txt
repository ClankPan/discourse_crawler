Wenzel, we clearly told you multiple times we have no affiliation with them.


Do people still believe your words? in this forums?


You seem to be focused on us, why don't you create a separate topic for all the questions you have about us?


Instead of continuously derailing this thread and doing damage control, get a life and seek god.

To those unaware. this is how DFINITY operates. We did dedicate significant amount of time debunking narratives in the forums today and yesterday.

Ok fine can you just leave it at that. If anyone from Boom Dao cares to respond to this ok glad to hear them out. I already trashed @Phasma once before for being (how to put this politeley) ignorant to say the least for stirring S*** up since it was clearly answered in the official Boom Dao SNS proposal that @wpb and @icpmaximalist are different persons and have nothing to do with each other for this project. Even though @wpb had a positive post about believing in the al so Hyped gaming vertical project and I was against it at this time as can be clearly seen by our different opinion we agreed to disagree and moved on letting people vote as they see fit. Now back to this timeline they were called out with all the people on their website as partners founding or whatnot and posting that there is only one main contributor  and yet they drained the treasury. So again attacking @wpb just as a personal vendetta  has to stop. Thank you

**In our honest opinion, now is not the time about who is whom, but instead we must focus on WHY THIS PROBLEM EXISTs on ICP**

The simple answer is Echochambers and Narratives crafted by DFINITY leading to self reinforcing availability cascades.

Because BOOM DAO was THE CURRENT THING, as promoted by @Jan - CTO of DFINITY, Wenzel and his friends.


Edit 3: In other words. This is a losing game for DFINITY because they forgot to factor in our Autism

Where can I find my Principal ID to use as a Hotkey for voting on BoomDAOSNS?

No problem - would you mind answering mine?

Why did you tie me into this nonsense?

It’s quite a bold unfounded assumption - so I’m curious how your critical thinking skills led you there to begin with.

Yes, I don’t mind answering your question if you want.  @Apollon is a new identity and refuses to reveal more about himself.  He clearly is familiar with the ICP ecosystem.  So naturally, I am curious who he is and why he is launching such vigorous personal attacks against me.  

The style of communication that @Apollon uses is very similar to you @Accumulating.icp.  The tactics for how he gets his point across is also similar to you…things like cross posting his previous messages, providing links meant to educate on social interactions (e.g. straw man and availability cascade), and twisting a narrative to suit his agenda.  It was also noticeable that you were not engaged in the discussion while @apollon has been engaged.  These are just context clues, but I’m not interested in making assumptions.  Hence, I thought I’d just ask you directly.

I take your word for it.  I asked a simple question and you provided an answer, which I appreciate.  If fine with leaving it there.  If it blows into something more then it will be because @Apollon or you press the issue further.

You have answered zero questions 

You have derailed the topic and have deflected from the purpose of this thread.

You have vested interest with DFINITY directly

You are defending treasury drain and 51% attacks

But somehow @Accumulating.icp is to be blamed for this? Man up and take up the responsibility for your actions.

The claims you’re making are easily disproven, although I can tell your banking on people not looking into this further.

Have I cross-posted topics? Yes. So does @bjoernek (and countless others, at that) - would you say we’re the same person? 

Of course not, because claiming that utilizing a feature within a forum hints at identity is ridiculous.

Your claim that I “provide links meant to educate on social interaction” is also false - I don’t think I’ve literally ever done this. 

And finally, I have to conclude with the irony in the baseless claim that I “twist narratives” - as if that isn’t what you’re attempting to do as we speak.

Again, I strongly encourage anyone reading this to delve into the history of my forum account, as these claims are a repetitive attempt to discredit character.

In regards to this “reasoning” - I honestly think it has to be the weakest yet. Due to the fact that I’m not engaging in a petty argument, that means I have made a new account to do so in disguise…? 

Have you ever considered that people are busy, are building things - and don’t care to waste time on pointless arguments in the forum?

Your Bad Actor conspiracy theories don’t hold water so stop pushing it already - it’s starting to look really silly.

Dude, you are making a mountain out of a molehill.  I asked a simple question based on context clues and you provided all the answer I needed.  Move on.
