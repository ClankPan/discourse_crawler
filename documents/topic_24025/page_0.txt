I am not sure how many people have read the BOOM DAO whitepaper and I have to admit that I had not until quite recently.  There is something that I noticed that caused great alarm for me and I feel I have to draw attention to it.

> ## Staking ICP as 8-year Neurons
> 
> BOOM DAO is planning to create a proposal to stake a significant amount of ICP as a BOOM DAO 8-year neuron. This neuron would participate in NNS voting by following a BOOM DAO beacon neuron, which would seek to influence the IC's governance to align with BOOM DAO's long-term goals of advocating for the ICP gaming ecosystem at large. The neuron would also earn voting rewards for the DAO, which could be used to cover ongoing costs or build up a reserve. However, this plan depends on whether a small but significant change is made to the IC to allow canisters to control neurons.

Unless I am understanding this incorrectly, Boom DAO are saying that they will only stake for 8 years if they have the ability to then sell the neuron?

Dfinity have already said they do not want a neuron marketplace, and I agree with the reasons why.  It kind of defeats the whole purpose of locking up and showing your faith in the community.

If Boom DAO really intended to lock up for 8 years, why are the funds they removed from the treasury only locked for 6 months?  Waiting for that bull by any chance?

I have been wary of this project ever since they made a bogus announcement about working with us, but their recent behaviour is raising red flag after red flag.

I do not benefit in any way from their downfall, I actually hope I am wrong and this isnt a blatant scam. It would be great to bring more games (and therefore more players) into the IC ecosystem.  However, scams and rugpulls bring nothing but bad publicity and make people less likely to invest in real projects going forward.

Once again we are not working with BOOM and never will.  

I strongly advise you to avoid this project and the Boom token.  

Beware!

Thank you for this topic @Thyassa, for me personally I felt confidence in the BOOM DAO project (also) as the main developer/founder (@atomikm) was a long-term and trusted contributor to the ICP ecosystem - and I believe I was not alone.

@atomikm please can you provide a statement regarding the described Red Flags and overall current situation?

Imo the only serious project they currently have is @Gekctek 's library <https://github.com/BoomDAO/ICP.NET>
I think he wrote he is just a contributor and not part of project management.
And then later Boom DAO posted 
![image|690x86](upload://6N1jH3STK3jzQScUsOKZ4qsanWg.png)
which makes me think they mean Tommy or <https://github.com/h1teshtr1path1>
Which only made the game launcher, a list of links to other people's games,
and a weird world engine that doesn't look like it's currently doing anything more than handle tokens.

You could tell it was a scam with the botted replies in the SNS proposal thread and how they used a fiver project for their demo presentation. There were so many red flags about the project and I voiced my concerns in the proposal thread but eventually these concerns were censored or baisclaly anybody questioning anything they proposed was pretty much censored. 
It's funny though how the team doxxed themselves and the majority of the projects that "partnered" with them will now be considered bad actors as well when that could not be the case.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-10-26 14:47:32 UTC | #8

We got slammed for debating that it's not time for SNS yet. So many Founding Partners including Rick and DSCVR and Dfinity backing there really was nothing much the community could do.
https://u52bf-3qaaa-aaaal-qb5wq-cai.icp0.io/ So yeah only one is unique and the rest is history. 
Not the first and for sure not the last.

aiv | 2023-10-26 15:27:06 UTC | #10

The only thing I'll comment on here is just the assumption that canister-controlled neurons means they want to sell the 8 year neuron.

I think there is a misunderstanding here, so let me add some context:

**How allowing canister-controlled neurons could enable neuron sales/transfers**
The idea is that a marketplace could be created where canisters are created that hold neurons, and then the ownership of the canisters themselves would be tradeable. You cannot change the owner of the neuron, but you can change the owner of a canister.

**Why an SNS DAO would require canister-controlled neurons**
Right now, there's no way for an SNS DAO controlled canister to control a NNS neuron directly because the NNS code intentionally prohibits any canisters from owning neurons (there's no technical barrier). This means there must always be a trusted human custodian controlling the principal which owns each NNS neuron. Therefore, BOOM DAO is just stating a fact, they need a canister-controlled neuron feature enabled so that they can have a NNS neuron which is collectively owned by the SNS DAO.

**An SNS DAO Selling a Neuron**
If a canister controlled by an SNS DAO did in fact own a neuron, then it technically might be able to sell it, but not very easily. First off, all the SNS token holders would need to approve the ownership transfer proposal. Secondly, I'm sure there would be some difficult logistics regarding payment escrow, etc. I can't see why anyone would want to go through the trouble of buying a neuron from an SNS DAO, since easier alternatives would likely exist.

**Current status of neuron trading & canister-controlled neurons**
There are technically ways to do both of these things, it's just that the methods for doing them are a bit messy and hacked together. You can trade a neuron by trading an Internet Identity on [IDGeek](https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.ic0.app/). Also, a canister should be able to do an HTTPS outcall to the NNS canister and use Threshold ECDSA to control an NNS neuron, but this is very complex and I'm not certain if a team has pulled it off yet. Even if the code for this was made open source, it's not an ideal situation and probably too hard to maintain for it to be a good option for an SNS DAO canister.

**Possible Solution: Permissioned Canisters allowed to hold NNS neurons**
The NNS code could be updated to allow for either:
1. A permissioned set of canisters voted on and approved by the NNS which are granted the ability to control NNS neurons (similar to how the Known Neurons registration works).
2. A blanket approval that grants any SNS DAO controlled canister the ability to control NNS neurons.

Personally, I think more ICP projects should be creating neurons and participating in governance, particularly SNS DAOs. While I also understand the concern around giving any and all canisters the ability to control an NNS neuron, I don't really see any risk to giving SNS DAO controlled canisters this capability. Personally, I believe it would be ideal to have decentralized Known Neurons for people to follow!

-------------------------

Gekctek | 2023-10-26 15:56:56 UTC | #11

That's correct. I am just a contributor of ICP.NET and potentially projects down the line, but i am not involved in management. In optimistic about Boom DAO but I have no inside knowledge as of yet. It was laid out in the roadmap, so everything seems to be going according to plan

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-10-26 15:59:37 UTC | #12

I don't think there's a misunderstanding.

I think Boom DAO are using the guise of wanting the neuron controlled by the SNS to distract from the fact they just drained the treasury.  All this talk of being committed to the future of the project, but there's absolutely nothing that shows that commitment.

They didn't want the vote that moved all the ICP off to their wallet to be controlled by the SNS, so why would they care about the neurons?  Apparently I voted yes, didn't get the chance to vote though since they waited till > 50% followed their dev neuron.

"We would lock for 8 years, but we want X first, so we'll just lock for 6 months."  

Does that seem like
a) they're looking for a technical solution that benefits the community, and want to earn a tiny amount of APY for the project in the interim?

b) they want to dump in 6 months and are looking for excuses

-------------------------

charlesm | 2023-10-26 16:10:53 UTC | #13

It seems the project doesn't intend to rug. It looks like they intend to use the funds to keep building. Withdrawing 80% of the funds isn't what I or anyone expected (even though it was in their whitepaper). But it is allowed by the SNS framework. And BOOM DAO seems like a team committed to the IC. 

If people don't want this type of proposal to happen, then the SNS framework should have code that enforces the behavior that the community wants. Perhaps beacon neurons shouldn't be able to vote on treasury proposals. But what they did doesn't go against what the SNS allows. And they seem committed to use the funds to keep building. If in the future, we want projects to do smaller withdrawals, then we need to have code in the SNS that enforces this. Code is law.

Archetypal | 2023-10-26 17:31:35 UTC | #14

BOOM DAO has done a remarkable job of responding to the many concerns that keep popping up throughout its history. But that raises the question: How and why are they so good at managing perception of their project, and why do concerns keep popping up over and over? At some point you have to look past their ability to put out fires and ask why do things keep catching on fire? Something is going on here. Whether it's incompetence or malicious activity is irrelevant. I'm staying clear of investing for now.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-10-26 18:18:41 UTC | #16

As I have clarified many times in direct response to your false claims, I am not involved in the BoomDAO project in any way.  It’s not clear to me why you continuously want to make this association.

Supposedly you contributed in censoring comments in the thread for their sns proposal that outlined that the project was a scam. So if this is true then you help contribute to sway people's opinion on the boomdao project. 
Anybody go look at their sns proposals thread and tell me it's not botted responses

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-10-26 20:02:23 UTC | #19

I often stand up for civilized and intellectually honest conversation.  If people get their comments hidden or deleted for violating the forum rules then that’s on them.  It’s happened to me many times.  Even though I often disagree with the assessment, I prefer to use it as a learning experience and move on.  It’s very easy to raise red flags in a diplomatic way without ad hominem attacks, etc.  Comments that remain civilized have always been welcome on the forum and are not typically censored.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-10-26 22:21:13 UTC | #20

That’s true.  One of the main leaders for BoomDAO goes by @icpmaximalist.  He started the ICP Maximalist Network chat group on Telegram just after genesis.  He also was a leader for PlethoraGame, IC Gallery, and the Moonwalker NFT series.  These are all positive achievements.  That’s not saying I agree with the withdrawal of 80% of the BoomDAO SNS treasury, but he has a history of building communities and projects in the ICP ecosystem that I think is mostly positive.  My hope is that he and @atomikm will spend more time addressing concerns that have been raised recently on the forum such as this thread, but I can also understand if he is hesitant at this time due to all the criticism.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-10-26 20:50:45 UTC | #21

Yes there were instances where it wasn't civilized discussion but that happened after they started blatantly censoring/marking everything that questioned them as off topic. 
If you aren't signed into an account you cannot read the hidden responses. Meaning people fell for the bot shilling and decided boomdao was a legitimate project. Then they got away with presenting their project to dfinity with a game they bought off of fiver and just put it in a canister then claimed they built it. Sad how many people here fell for this

-------------------------

aiv | 2023-10-26 21:25:13 UTC | #22

Yeah from the little I've heard about the situation it definitely seems like things should have been handled better by the BOOM DAO team, whatever their intentions.

All I meant was that just because an SNS DAO might request the canister controlled neuron feature, that doesn't as a general rule always mean there's an intention to sell the neuron.

Outside of this situation and just in general, I would like to see more SNS DAOs expressing (and actually acting on) a desire to participate in NNS governance.

I only briefly met the BOOM DAO team once and they seemed nice, hoping they eventually do right by the ecosystem in this situation but I don't have enough context to really comment on it. I've been wrapped up in a family emergency this week and been out of the loop.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but when the ICP is removed from the SNS treasury it goes into a wallet instead of a neuron.  Hence, there is no need to sell a neuron if you never have to put ICP in a neuron.

Staking for 6 months earns half the rewards of staking for 8 years.  At the returns we see today, than means a 6 month neuron is earning 8.8% annualized rewards.

I was just referring to the content of the original post, which was inferring from the Whitepaper that the intention of requesting the canister controlled neuron was to make sure the neuron could be sold.

Yeah since they have the ICP they can do whatever they want with it now and the 8 year neuron thing is pretty much irrelevant unless they load it back into the DAO or something.

Going to share this as it’s more relevant in this thread than the last. I hope this is a realization moment for everyone participating in SNS DAOs. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:28, topic:23798"]
they extracted 80% of an SNS DAOs Treasury in a Lump Sum, executed the proposal within 3 minutes, allocated 100x funding for themselves over liquidity pools, and claim that 80k ICP is enough to “build the future of gaming” while they had to take 320k ICP for basic tooling that was already in existence?

Seems real sustainable, thank God they’ve allocated less than 1/3 of what they took to a Neuron! If you do basic math you’ll quickly realize that the Neuron won’t regain the full 320k ICP even after 8 years staked compounded.

I’m not going to entertain this ignorance further, I’m just going to state that I’m beyond concerned for the future of ICP as a blockchain if your mindset of careless-ness continues to cultivate amongst others.

Just a reminder. SNS DAOs can hold ckBTC. If they are that scared the ICP price won't hold, BTC won't be moving too much, and selling ICP for BTC held by the DAO is a lesser evil than selling it for USD and holding it in another organization that doesn't provide any transparency.

And any token on any chain using ECDSA actually - but a bit harder to do. Including Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Zcash, Tron, Ripple, Dogecoin

We can probably get the public key of a canister and generate addresses on other chains without having anything inside a canister. Maybe. there is such a tool already?
Then you can just have a function that signs messages with TECDSA (it doesn't have to understand or build them) the messages will be built outside and included inside the proposal. Others can verify them.

My concern is how this further works to create a negative perception of the ICP ecosystem. I leant the hard way in my teenage years don't play fully for anything upfront, after you have paid up front there is no obligation to deliver.

Also the economics of this doesnt work out, if you drain the treasury at the start of a tokenised project  then the tokens that were meant to help fund the project long term will just become worthless. Why would I buy Boom Dao a token now?

If you need cash upfront the way to go about that is to sell equity in the project itself and became beholden to share holders through the legal frame work of the country the business resides.

NNS/SNS DAOs are just a laughable guise of decentralization. The community and DFINITY should reflect on how to prevent a repeat of the ICP tragedy.

LOL, the ratio of @catpirate (banned) (aka @Ivan (banned) = @ivan_uncensored (banned) = @Artemi5 (banned) = @Apollon = @boomerfinity) tagging @wpb has been something like 100 : 7 in the last 24 hours and yet @apollon wants to twist the narrative to claim @wpb has been tagging non stop.

Accusations? Boom DAO just drained 320,000 ICP from the treasury. I thought that was the whole point of this thread.


There is proof on chain if you want to see. You just have to navigate to the ICA dashboard and check BOOM DAO SNS

Sormarler | 2023-10-29 19:15:15 UTC | #100

Perhaps he was blown away by the presentations and couldn't have predicted what they would do in the future.

 Also, it is not a foreign conclusion that BoomDAO has stolen the money and they won't fulfill their promises.

 I would add that the SNS framework is a year old. DAOs have been around since Ethereum and no one has figured out how to make them work yet. Cut SNS some slacks. It's fine to be critical but come with some solutions like @accumulatingicp has done, as that's the only way this thing is going to improve.

Yep, I have advocated for BoomDAO since their launch.  I think it is a great project and they have provided good infrastructure that is being used by projects.  Yet I was as surprised as everyone else when they moved 80% of the treasury in one move.  Turns out they claim it was written into their [whitepaper](https://boomdao.notion.site/BOOM-DAO-WHITEPAPER-59bc2aa3380b4f86b01344da42157a24), which was published prior to the token swap.  It also turns out that the SNS framework allows this to happen currently.  So I'm not so sure it is accurate to claim this is a rug or a criminal act.  They have posted explanations for their actions on Twitter ([here](https://x.com/boomdaosns/status/1716881817465213069?s=20) and [here](https://x.com/boomdaosns/status/1717430075065282728?s=20)) and they have continued to [release products](https://x.com/boomdaosns/status/1718080359483486310?s=20) since that treasury move.  Nonetheless, it's understandable for the community, including me, to be uncomfortable with such a big treasury move so early for all the reasons described in the civilized portions of this public discussion.  I would love to see @icpmaximalist and @atomikm provide further public clarification on the forum as I have already called for [earlier in this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/warning-boom-dao-red-flag/24025/20?u=wpb).  That could help boost community confidence or at least provide new clarity.  

In the meantime, I have already offered [significant contribution](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/only-1-icp-in-icxs-sns-icp-treasury-what-is-the-warning-the-reflection-the-action-for-us/23798/39?u=wpb) to ideation on how this issue could be resolved in the future.  You would know this if you had actually read any of these threads ([here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/only-1-icp-in-icxs-sns-icp-treasury-what-is-the-warning-the-reflection-the-action-for-us/23798?u=wpb), [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/warning-boom-dao-red-flag/24025?u=wpb), [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-make-your-own-decisions-on-sns-treasury-proposals/24045?u=wpb) and [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/roadblocks-weve-hit-building-vpgeek-app-the-ultimate-ic-voting-power-dashboard/24002?u=wpb)).  Instead, you feel you are adding to the "information and discourse" by posting old news, making bold premature claims, and trying to put people on the spot who have nothing to do with the actions of BoomDAO or ICX.  Stop the bully tactics and help the community grow.  We can all make improvements.  For example, we should all take a look at how we set up our SNS neurons.  It's not required to follow the SNS beacon neuron on all topics.  DFINITY has already offered [advice on how](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-make-your-own-decisions-on-sns-treasury-proposals/24045?u=wpb) to configure our neurons to ensure they only will vote manually even if we follow the SNS beacon neuron on All Topics.  Get the word out.  That's how you can be more helpful.  I'm sure there will be improvements in the SNS framework to help mitigate these kinds of issues, but the reality is they will take time and the community needs to be patient.  You are not helping IMO; you are only harassing.  Your contributions to this thread sound as if you are only seeking an echo chamber.  People have expressed a variety of opinions and yet you criticize any opinion that does not sound like your own.  Why don't you simply embrace diversity of thought on this subject.  Perhaps then you would actually achieve your claim of being "here only for information and discourse"

Ethereum is

LOL.  One vs an army.

Today we saw about 40 aggressive personal attack spam messages by @ivan_unsensored before he was banned.  That was followed by the creation of a new account called @boomerfinity, which dished out another 50 or so messages with the same type of egregious content shown in the screen capture below.  Then an account was created that they called @cat2 that tried to impersonate a response from @CatPirate.  The screen capture of the Flagged Post that was Removed by Staff was posted by @Apollon Research within 1 minute, which can only happen if Apollon was in control of the @cat2 account.  At that point @Artemi5 showed back up after his ban and reveals that the army has a Discord where they collect information about their targets.  @nolyoi was posting aggressive nonsense and @Tromix claims that I am weaponizing the forum.

This army is slimy.  They hide behind multiple anonymous personalities.  They conspire to bait responses.  They are highly aggressive knowing that posts will be deleted or hidden and then they switch identities and soften their tone so they can make it look like their victim is the aggressor.  They refuse to reveal themselves.  They literally wish their victims will "get cancer" and call them a "piece of shit".  

This is the sad reality of Apollon Research and their army.

I think it's funny the ICP ecosystem is highly critical of other networks using AWS, but it's okay for Web 3 video games to go through Unity or Unreal Engine for licensing... as if it's not contributing the same issues.

Web 3 gaming should use open source game engines that isn't controlled by centralized companies for licensing's. Any Unity or Unreal Engine future update could become a massive issue for game developers.



The treasury is drained, hopefully the core founders continue to contribute to the network, and if they choose to do so, make it more than the bare minimum.

We raised concern prior to their launchpad, **for many reasons.** 

Voting Power 
33% founders & partner allocation (**which clearly wasn't enough at once** 😆)
Basic tooling infrastructure which @borovan also pointed out that it likely took just a few weeks to code.


This ecosystem needs to actually listen to criticism without calling it fud. The SNS has now become a launchpad for projects to come through and drain funds. DFINITY said the SNS is not exit liquidity, and teams are demonstrating that it's quite the opposite. These teams are no longer obligated to update the code. It's literally up to the DAO of investors if these developers run off... Crazy.

If there are proposals or ideas on redesigning SNS DAO, I wholeheartedly support the initiation of a new thread dedicated to that purpose.
