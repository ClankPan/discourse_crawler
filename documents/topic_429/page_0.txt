Hello community!

We are so excited to announce that V0.5.0 of the SDK is available for download! :partying_face:

**What's new?**
* Module imports no longer require  `.mo`  file extensions.
For example,  `import List "mo:stdlib/list.mo";`  now becomes  `import List "mo:stdlib/list";`

* All functionality required for LinkedUp to compile is included in this version.
The LinkedUp repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/dfinity-lab/linkedup).
* What was previously referred to as the Internet Computer  `client`  is being renamed to  `replica` .
Documentation is in the process of being updated to reflect this change.

* New tutorials have been added to provide additional guidance to new developers and include more sample code.
A front-end tutorial is now available [here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/developers-guide/tutorials/custom-frontend.html).

**Issues fixed in this release:**
* Main.js is no longer hardcoded
* Improved error messages when using  `--client`  flag incorrectly
* Improved syntax error messages for Motoko compiler

Also a quick reminder of the breaking change from V0.4.13 which removes definitions like  `debugPrint` ,  `abs`  and  `range`  from the default scope. You now have to import them through the Motoko standard library. For help with importing from the standard library, check out [this section](https://sdk.dfinity.org/language-guide/index.html#intro-stdlib) of the Motoko language reference and also the [phonebook tutorial](https://sdk.dfinity.org/developers-guide/tutorials/phonebook.html).

Cheers!
