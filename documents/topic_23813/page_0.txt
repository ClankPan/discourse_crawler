The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals today, 2023-10-16.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals this coming Thursday.

This release consists of previously released and rolled back changes, and additional refactorings

## Additional Notes / Breaking Changes

This is a partial re-release of [features that went out](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-update-october-6-2023/23544) and were reverted last week due to a bug causing too many cycles to be consumed during NNS Governance heartbeat.  That fix is included as well.

In addition to code refactoring, optimisations and maintenance, the following externally visible changes were implemented:

### Major Changes

* A bug fix that will enforce the minimum exchange rate of ICP to XDR when rewarding node providers. This check was previously enforced when submitting Exchange Rate proposals but was missed when implementing the exchange rate canister. There is no noticeable change in the current behavior.
* Disabling the submission of UpdateAllowedPrincipals proposal in NNS Governance. This disables the first step of the legacy SNS initialization method. All SNSes must now use the 1-proposal method via the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal.
