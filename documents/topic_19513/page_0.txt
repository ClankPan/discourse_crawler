This is the code I'm using to create an argument file. It passes but the wasm isn't in the right format and fails. 

Is there a different encoding icp expects of blobs?

```

echo " \
  (record { owner = principal \"$(dfx identity get-principal)\"}, \
  \"This is a proposal for a WebAssembly module.\", \
  \"My Wasm Proposal\", \
  blob \"$(base64 < "$1")\", \
  null, \
  null,
  opt \"Test App Name\")" >> argFile.txt

```

The IC expects Candid-encoded blobs. I think the easiest way we have right now is to use [ic-repl](https://github.com/chenyan2002/ic-repl#functions) to work with files. Search for `file(path)` in the docs.

Is that a rust cli tool to do it? Is there any alternative that doesn't force me to download and install something? I'm trying to use as little dependencies as possible for a tutorial.

I regularly hit that problem too. Let me ask the team what they use for that

I can write a typescript script to do it if that is possible. This is a typescript tutorial so that would be viable.

It's not base64. Just hex representation of the raw bytes, e.g. `blob "\00\61\73\6d\01\00...."`

ahh well now I have new problems lol 

``` 

Error: Failed update call.
Caused by: Failed update call.
  The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 413 Payload Too Large, content type "", content: Request 0xae6fe6aa2858b80968095cd3a380294540048b62b9b5c689200d581cd152faea is too large. Message byte size 3115507 is larger than the max allowed 2097152.
```


solution to this post is 

```
hex_string=$(xxd -p file.wasm)

# Add slashes between each byte in the hex string
hex_string_with_slashes=$(sed 's/../&\//g; s/.$//' <<< "$hex_string")
```

You can try to compress the Wasm and provide `.wasm.gz` blob.
