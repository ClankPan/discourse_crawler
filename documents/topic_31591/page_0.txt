What size of Wasm is supported by the proposal type [UpgradeSnsControlledCanister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals/#upgradesnscontrolledcanister)?

If the limit is only 2 MB, is there a plan and a concrete timeline to support larger payloads?

Context:

I plan to migrate Juno's console to a single canister architecture, deprecating its current dfx asset canister. I want to design a solution that is compatible with a potential future SNS proposal while also optimizing development efforts.

Unfortunately, since the ingress message size limit is 2mb, it's complicated to support installing larger canisters than that. It's possible (see [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/allow-installation-of-large-wasm-modules/17372/70)), but we don't have a specific timeline for supporting it on the SNS.

Yep, I know it's possible. That's why I was asking about the timeline to support larger payloads in case that had not yet been supported. ðŸ˜‰

It's surprising, though, that among all the NNS canisters and all the SNSes, such a requirement has never popped up before.

Nevertheless, it's good to know that I should hack around a solution that better need to amend this limitation.

Thanks for the feedback!
