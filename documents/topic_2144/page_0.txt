Going forward,..what options do we have for containing/reducing the energy footprint of the internet?

Think of the Megawatts behind your Megabytes...

As data centers use around 50% of power used to deliver the Internet,..
Couldn't/Shouldn't Dfinity actively Promote the use of carbon neutral energy in Internet Computer participating data centers???

All data centers Could/Should be using GREEN energy.

Q; It takes 70Billion kilowatts hours per year to run the Internet,.. how much of that is Carbon Free?????????

Data centers using carbon neutral energy could be given preference over ones that do not. 
A tokenised insentive could be given maybe???
