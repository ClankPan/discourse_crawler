* **Where?** On [this zoom link](https://dfinity.zoom.us/j/99550279424?pwd=SFlDbkRVVTV2bm1XSjFYMWJjanZmdz09).

Hi all,

A quick look at the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns) shows that ten SNS DAOs have launched successfully. The associated dapps are now fully managed by the SNS DAOs!

As these SNSs manage their dapps and as new projects plan to launch SNSs, new questions arise, for example how SNSs can be customized with the given parameters and how automation can be built by combining SNS functionalities with custom dapp canisters.

We think it is great that such questions are discussed on the forum, as we hope this will create and foster a setting where different SNS communities can help each other and find answers to questions in older forum posts.

Nevertheless, we acknowledge that some topics are easier to discuss in a direct conversation. Therefore we would like to complement the forum discussions with office hours to discuss such technical questions related to SNSs.

We propose to start with the following setting and evaluate in the end of November 2023 how this format works:

* **30 min** sessions
* **Bi-weekly**
* Every other **Wednesday**, 5PM CEST / 8AM PST
* First session is on **October 18th**
* At least one DFINITY representative from a team working on the SNS is there.
* We meet [on **Zoom**](https://dfinity.zoom.us/j/99550279424?pwd=SFlDbkRVVTV2bm1XSjFYMWJjanZmdz09) and everyone is invited to join.
* Find **all dates** in [this calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_cgoeq917rpeap7vse3is1hl310@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Zurich).

We hope that this new format is useful for you and are looking forward to seeing many of you in the SNS office hours!
