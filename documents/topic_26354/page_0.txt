hello,

I'm now compounding my ICP maturity. Now, if i want to dissolve my icp, my staked ICP and my staked maturity will be made liquid ICP after my 8 year staking period. I don't wanna get the risk of losing 5% or getting 5% more staked maturity converted to liquid ICP. 

Is this possible to stake maturity directly to staked ICP. Also how would this change my aging boost?

Avoiding maturity modulation is not possible. You might be interested in reading this [code comment].

There used to be a thing called MergeMaturity, but that is now obsolete, superseded by StakeMaturity. If you try to do MergeMaturity now, you will get [an Err response][err]. IIUC, even then, modulation would be applied.

hello, thanks for answering. i'm happy to read that staked maturity will be made liquid maturity after 8 years dissolving. So i can still chose when i mint ICP with maturity.

I have another question now. If i have staked maturity, will this staked maturity also get an age bonus of 25 percent after 4 year?

Yes, the dissolve delay bonus and age bonus are applied to staked ICP plus staked maturity in order to calculate the voting power of the neuron.

I would like to ask in this thread, how long is the approximate time until the release of both these features?
