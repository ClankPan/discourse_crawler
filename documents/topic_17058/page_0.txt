Generally disappear after a refresh, does it? You have the issue on all devices?

II is fine on my side, on all my devices. Will forward your screenshot.

I am using on iPhone and I have tried chrome and Safari browser.  But all show the same as on the picture😌

Chrome = Safari on iOS.

That being said, refreshed my device and same issue. Likewise on desktop with Safari. However, strangly, do not have the issue on Chrome and Firefox desktop.

I cannot help personaly but escalate it.

Team was reactive and cleared some cache which solved the issue I faced - i.e. I can access II on all my devices including phone and Safari desktop again.

Can you try out too @Tony89, does it do the tricks for you too?

If it does, sounds good then. According BN team it's a known caching issue an a fix should be rolled out within next few days.
