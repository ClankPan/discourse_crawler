I believe stackoverflow is a great resource for programmers to use for questions and there doesn't seem to be many Motoko question there yet.
I have already asked a few questions there but was wondering how cross-posting/linking should be handled (if at all) for visibility.
What is the policy for linking stackoverflow questions here for visibility?
Or should i just copy and paste the content in both places

@Ori tried to get something dedicated going at one point but Iâ€™m not sure where it ended up.
