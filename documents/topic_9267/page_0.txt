You can switch identities with `dfx identity use <identity_name>`

`dfx identity list` will show all of your identities, these are all stored in the ~/.config/dfx/identity directory on your local machine. Copying a .pem file generated by keysmith to a named folder in this directory will add it as an identity in this list.

Running `dfx ledger account-id` will then show the ledger address for the currently selected identity.

As per your screenshot, you can then send ICP using `dfx ledger transfer`:

If you need to see the options for any of the dfx commands you can use the --help flag, eg 
`dfx ledger --help`
`dfx ledger transfer --help`

If youâ€™re using an airgapped setup (sign messages on an airgapped machine, send them from a networked machine) then the quill tool is a good option and has similar commands: [https://github.com/dfinity/quill#usage](https://github.com/dfinity/quill#usage)
