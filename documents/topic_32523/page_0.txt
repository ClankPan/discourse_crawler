Are you building a DeAI product on ICP or enhancing an AI product using ICP? 

As part of the recent Growth/Marketing/Adoption joint call with the [DeAI Technical Working Group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-deai/24621/135), we discussed highlighting success stories through DFINITY social media channels and amplifying key major metrics through any websites or publications that track web3 growth metrics by ecosystem.

We invite you to fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/fS58RzMwFZEC7gVL9) to help us promote any success stories of AI on ICP.

If you have any questions or blockers from completing the survey, please DM me.

Thank you to @patnorris for the idea!
