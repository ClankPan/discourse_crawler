The NNS Team will be submitting the following proposals to publish new versions of SNS canisters to the SNS-WASM canister this Friday, 2023-05-26.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## Breaking Change

Note that these changes will only take effect when an SNS decide to upgrade, not immediately after the new SNS version is published to the SNS-WASM canister.

### Who it affects:

1. Users of `CanisterStatusResultV2`, which represents a canister summary
2. SNS Root’s `get_sns_canisters_summary`, which returns the statuses and the canister IDs of all the canisters in an SNS
3. SNS Governance’s `get_root_canister_status`, which returns the root canister status

### The change:

1. Several fields were removed from `CanisterStatusResultV2` ([candid](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/39c2dee156b2913f4ad65391ca4f82d7175daf86?diff=unified#diff-d418b80b399204bee0fc872852276594b422a9a2fdc9ce3a4bcec52ff63bc72dL10-L20), [old struct](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/39c2dee156b2913f4ad65391ca4f82d7175daf86?diff=unified#diff-51ae61d6ccac5208f4d26dcd6794ec0b03d68d7f36c86b90feea6052935d4488L74-L85), [new struct](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/39c2dee156b2913f4ad65391ca4f82d7175daf86?diff=unified#diff-23c0997f3fcf769a3347de9eca677514142a5e9abbca93d4c60158715dd619b1R208-R216)) and `DefiniteCanisterSettingsArgs` ([candid](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/39c2dee156b2913f4ad65391ca4f82d7175daf86?diff=unified#diff-d418b80b399204bee0fc872852276594b422a9a2fdc9ce3a4bcec52ff63bc72dL28-L32), [old struct](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/39c2dee156b2913f4ad65391ca4f82d7175daf86?diff=unified#diff-51ae61d6ccac5208f4d26dcd6794ec0b03d68d7f36c86b90feea6052935d4488L202-L208), [new struct](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/39c2dee156b2913f4ad65391ca4f82d7175daf86?diff=unified#diff-23c0997f3fcf769a3347de9eca677514142a5e9abbca93d4c60158715dd619b1R303-R308), you might have to click to expand the diff).
    1. `CanisterStatusResultV2::freezing_threshold` and `CanisterStatusResultV2::balance` are removed as they are duplicated inside `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings`.
    2. `CanisterStatusResultV2::controller` and `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings::controller` are removed as they have invalid semantics (canisters can have multiple or zero controllers). Instead of these fields, the field `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings::controllers` should be used to get a canister’s controllers
4. SNS governance’s `get_root_canister_status` is being removed, because its is subsumed by `get_sns_canisters_summary` (which also returns the root canister status)

### How to prevent breakage:

1. Instead of using `CanisterStatusResultV2::freezing_threshold` or `CanisterStatusResultV2::balance`, use the fields of the same name inside `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings` instead. These are `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings::freezing_threshold` and `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings::balance`.
2. Do not use `CanisterStatusResultV2::controller` or `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings::controller`. Instead, to get the canister’s controllers, use `CanisterStatusResultV2::settings::controllers`
3. Use SNS Root’s `get_sns_canisters_summary` instead of SNS’s Governance’s `get_root_canister_status`.

**Target date for submitting the proposal to publish these changes to SNS-WASM**: May 26th, 2023.

## Features

1. Profiling has been added to manage_neuron, giving greater visibility into which code paths are most responsible for cycles consumption. This will help developers identify and improve performance issues. The profiling information will be available in /metrics
2. Proposal payloads are now displayed in a more readable format
3. `get_proposal` now omits the proposal payload if it’s too large, which will fix the issue where large payloads would prevent the `get_proposal` response from fitting under the message size limit.
4. Added maturity modulation to the SNS

Update: The NNS team will also be submitting a proposal to upgrade the SNS Swap canister, and will submit slightly newer versions of the other two canisters. Here is the updated information:

The NNS Team will be submitting the following proposals to publish new versions of SNS canisters to SNS-WASM this Friday, 2023-05-26.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

The proposals are here! 
SNS Governance: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122622
SNS Root: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122623
SNS Swap: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122624

Keen-eyed readers may notice that the changelog for Root was edited to remove "Provide an NNS Root API to allow SNS-W to change controllers of a canister that SNS Root controls." This was removed from the proposal text because it pertains to NNS root, not SNS root. (The change did touch SNS root, but didn't change SNS root's observable behavior.) This edit is just a cosmetic change to the proposal text – the canister wasm hash in the proposal matches the one posted here.
