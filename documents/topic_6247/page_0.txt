How close are we to being able to do something like below?  Maybe we can do it now and I just can't figure out the signature?  Seems pretty important to creating a library of composable utiltities.

Utility.mo
```
module{
    public class Utility(){
       var nonce = 0;
       
       //cant do shared here because "a shared function is only allowed as a public field of an actor (This is a limitation of the current version.)"
       public func getNonce() : async Nat{nonce};
    };
}
```

myActor.mo
```
import Utility "Utility";
actor class myActor() = this {
     var __utility = Utility.Utility();

     public shared func getNonce() : () -> async Nonce = __utility.getNonce;
};
```

It would also be great to be able to do this for query functions.
