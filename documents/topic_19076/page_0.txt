## IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires Mac/Linux/WSL2, Git and Podman on your machine.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout 5058a1326d45303de376cd1a1dc5303fa27cdb07
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/5058a1326d45303de376cd1a1dc5303fa27cdb07/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image,
must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Update: @NathanosDev discovered that the script this week created a new folder that has not previously been used to hold the update-img.tar.gz file.  When we built the replica and produced the shasum that includes the guestos folder in the file path, we discovered that the hash does match the proposal payload.  I updated my review in the CodeGov portal showing the result of this new build.  I can now support the adoption of the proposal since I now realize that the build worked.  However, I cannot change my NNS vote since it has already been cast.

Original post:  I was not able to build the replica and two other reviewers who posted in the CodeGov portal had similar experience.  I recommend this proposal is rejected by DFINITY so the issue can be resolved and the community has the ability to properly reproduce the build of the replica from the public version of commit on the ic repository before it gets implemented.

Our reviews can be found in the CodeGov portal on DSCVR using this [link](https://dscvr.one/post/11007591/nns-proposal-114479-elect-new-replica-binary-revision-commit).

One note of interest, the release notes do not contain details of implementation of the financial spam prevention proposal 80970. DFINITY [posted on the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/financial-spam-prevention-nns-implementation-update/18917) two weeks ago that the proposal would be implemented in March 2023, so perhaps we will see it next Friday.

Thanks for the heads up (and actually building the replica!). Let me ping folks.

Hold on @diegop , I have an update... 

Please see my previous comment.  I can now support this proposal.

Note that spam prevention and other NNS-level proposals are NOT covered in IC release proposals. This proposal type is only about lower level code that runs on node machines.

...whereas the financial spam prevention logic would be implemented in an NNS canister (the governance canister, I guess).
