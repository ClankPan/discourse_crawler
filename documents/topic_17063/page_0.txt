Hi Everyone!

This is the Internet Identity roadmap update for December 2022:

Since the last update, we released finished the unified auth box with the multiple anchors picker and we also deployed the [II archive](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/uc7f6-kaaaa-aaaaq-qaaaa-cai) that records all anchor operations.

This month, the focus is on infrastructure improvements:
1. We are going to give anchors more space. This is an important change that will allow us to add more exciting new features to anchors as we continue developing II. It is also a requirement for the II domain migration, which is why we are working on it now.
2. We want to make testing II easier and streamline our CI pipeline. To that end, we are going to decouple II more from the IC repository by using a pre-built testing binary for the integration tests.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
