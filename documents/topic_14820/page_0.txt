A new minor version of agent-js is out!

With this version, the auth-client now stores delegations in indexeddb by default. No code changes are required, unless you want to continue using localstorage. In that case, import the LocalStorage interface from `@dfinity/auth-client` and pass it in as the `storage` implementation in the `create` options.

Cool improvements, it will ease the use of agent-js in web workers üëç

For those looking to upgrade and have already users in production. If you use long lasting session and want to prevent your users to have to sign-in again after the update, I would advise to wait a bit.

agent-js v0.13.0 tries to migrate localstorage session to new idb values to avoid users to have to sign-in again but I think I found an issue in that process. I provided a small PR [#608](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/pull/608).

Awesome! Bumped agent-js in [cycles.watch](https://cycles.watch/), updated the web workers ([PR](https://github.com/papyrs/cycles.watch/pull/5)) and it's already live!

It's so much convenient and resilient to query idb than having to pass the delegation over.

Thanks for that sweet improvement @kpeacock üëç
