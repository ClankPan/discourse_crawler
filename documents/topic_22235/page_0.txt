Hi there

I’ve been receiving the following error all day when trying to log in to the NNS:

“# Page failed to load.

ReferenceError: Can't find variable: DecompressionStream”

Others have told me repeatedly refreshing fixes the issue but no luck for me…

Can anyone provide any insight?

Thanks - have posted a reply there but that thread seemed entirely unhelpful. 

As mentioned I have the most updated versions of both chrome and safari but am still receiving the error. 

I’ll delete this thread if necessary.

:+1: Thanks for the response. Should have read that thread in more detail…

Yes, unfortunately this is a different issue than the one that was fixed by refreshing.

> As mentioned I have the most updated versions of both chrome and safari but am still receiving the error.

Are you on iOS? If that's the case then the latest Safari version that you can get access to is limited by the version of iOS that you're running. So upgrading iOS would likely be the solution for you (Chrome uses Safari under the hood so the same applies there). In any case, the fix will be out tonight.

Thanks for your patience!
