**I. Introduction**

The saga of $MOTOKO finds its genesis with Motoko Ghost NFTs; meticulously crafted artworks by Jon Ball of Poked Studios. These digital marvels, finding sanctuary in the hands of trailblazers of the Internet Computer, have taken on a life of their own, casting an enchanting spell upon the imaginations of adventurers traversing the digital expanse. Thus, a community was forged, bound together by a shared ethos of community and collaboration.

Finding life in Motoko Ghosts, $MOTOKO was manifested from the collaborative synergy of Accumulating.ICP and Sonic. Reflecting the total supply of Motoko Ghost NFTs, which stands at 10,000, there exist exactly 10,000 $MOTOKO tokens. This equivalency paved the way for a momentous 1:1 airdrop of $MOTOKO to Motoko Ghost NFT holders, solidifying the symbiotic relationship between the two entities.

At the heart of this burgeoning movement lies the Motoko DAO‚Äîan autonomous organization fashioned with the mission of stewarding the Motoko brand with unwavering integrity and inclusivity. Through a governance model steeped in decentralization, we aim to collectively chart the course of Motoko, drawing from the wellspring of our communal wisdom to navigate its trajectory with astuteness and foresight.

As the sun rises on the horizon of possibility, the Motoko DAO stands as a testament to the indomitable spirit of collaboration and innovation within the Internet Computer ecosystem. Together, we embark on a grand odyssey‚Äîa journey of discovery, transformation, and empowerment.

Through Motoko, we weave a tapestry of shared dreams and aspirations‚Äîa legacy that shall endure for generations to come.

**II. Vision of $MOTOKO**

In charting the future of $MOTOKO, our goal is to foster the seamless intertwinement of creativity, community, and technology, weaving an ecosystem of innovation and inspiration. Our vision extends beyond the realm of digital assets; it encompasses a holistic environment where every individual is empowered to contribute, collaborate, and flourish.

At the heart of our vision lies a commitment to community empowerment and brand elevation. Through the utilization of an SNS DAO, we establish a space where collaboration thrives, aiming to propel the Motoko and ICP branding to newfound levels of success & recognition. By harnessing the collective wisdom of our community, we aim to cultivate a culture of innovation and excellence that resonates across the digital landscape.

Together, we look towards a better tomorrow, for Motoko.

1. *Handover to NNS:* Upon completed preparations, control of the $MOTOKO canisters will be transferred to the NNS to initiate the SNS Sale.
2. *Token Distribution Management:* The NNS oversees the $MOTOKO token distribution, offering .0001 tokens for public purchase, designating 9994 tokens for the DAO treasury, and allocating 5.9999 tokens to the custodians.
3. *Token Swap:* The SNEED 1:1 Swap Canister has been forked to serve an identical purpose for $MOTOKO. A proposal will be set forth & accepted by custodians to transfer 9994 $MOTOKO from the treasury to the $MOTOKO 1:1 Swap dApp, offering existing holders the ability to convert ICRC $MOTOKO to SNS ICRC $MOTOKO - enabling decentralization of the SNS.

[/quote]

Quite some time ago I was approached by @Kyle_Langham in regards to potential airdrop ideas for the community - at the time, I didn‚Äôt have anything on my mind, however after some thought, I began to think that the Motoko branding could be leveraged into much more than it is now; a multi billion dollar company if done correctly. 

Upon forwarding this concept, interest was shown, however I was informed that DFINITY did not feel comfortable, from a legal perspective, creating & airdropping yet another token - so I asked if I could execute the project since they couldn‚Äôt, and got a greenlight. 

From there, I contacted Jon Ball, requesting permission to use the Motoko branding to perform this token drop. Again, we received a greenlight.

Finally, I got in contact with @memecake & the Sonic development team in regards to executing the airdrop & creating the token in a trustless manner, and again, they were more than happy to help.

That process took less than a day, and I have since been in consistent communication with DFINITY & mentioned parties on achieving SNS, and the direction we take after the fact.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 12:27:31 UTC | #17

My Named Neuron has voted no on every SNS to date (that I‚Äôve been available to vote on) - so that shouldn‚Äôt say much. Does participating in the sale get me brownie points?

& $STACK is currently transitioning to one of the first fully functioning stake based DAOs on ICP outside of the NNS/SNS - give us a minute ü§ù

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 12:35:19 UTC | #19

$STACK is a governance incentivization tool of $ICP.

$SNS1 was a blank slate & is now Dragginz.

$SNEED was a blank slate & is turning into a development hub.

$MOTOKO has the potential to govern a branding.

They genuinely, are not comparable.

Hi, thank you for that response.   

Could you provide a little more clarity on the following:

From this I gather you conceived the idea of the $MOTOKO token? Who is your contact at DFINITY and when did you approach them for approval? Was it months/weeks before the airdrop?

That is correct, and as mentioned, I began my communications with Kyle, however this quickly expanded to include Andrew & Lomesh. 

The planning & announcement happened within 24 hours, the drop itself took about a month to actuate from the development side.

Thank you, it makes sense that Lomesh was able to give the green light. 

Which Andrew are you referring too? 24 hours is a great turnaround, that‚Äôs really good to see. I vaguely remember the token launch. Was it on the same day Kyle posted this, 17th January?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 13:01:56 UTC | #23

I believe the actual airdrop itself commenced on the 30th of January.

I'm going to vote NO, I can't stand using ChatGPT to fool SNS.
Why should you set up MOTOKO DAO? Please write down your plan in detail and show your code.
Please remember that people in the community are not idiots, please do not tarnish SNS.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 13:42:47 UTC | #30

It‚Äôs a community effort - I can have all the plans in the world, however the DAO is going to be the one to determine the direction.

It‚Äôs premature for me to give a roadmap to $MOTOKO that was not voted upon - however I have made it clear that $MOTOKO has the potential to manage the Motoko branding, increasing overall awareness to itself & ICP as a whole. 

Codebase can be found in github link provided.

January 30th: $MOTOKO airdropped.   

Is that all correct?

Junkfarm | 2024-03-29 14:11:24 UTC | #41

It's currently supported by Dfinity and the Motoko NFT founder. The DAO is necessary to to advance the project being awareness to ICP NFTs. There is no hidden agenda here.

-------------------------

runner836 | 2024-03-29 14:12:53 UTC | #42

I think this is an excellent proposal and will advance the vision of the Motoko project and brand.
Thank you to everyone involved for making this happen.
Exciting times are coming!

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 14:14:49 UTC | #44

Initial discussions occured only with Jon Ball, Sonic, & Kyle - I‚Äôd assume there were internal discussions resulting in DFINITYs decision that they could not steward this project, and the acceptance of the community initiative.

-------------------------

Junkfarm | 2024-03-29 14:17:41 UTC | #45

I'll be voting Yes. This token has the potential to make a difference and bring lots of people together for the greater good. I see $Motoko being pivotal for ICP like MakerDAO, to add a reliable brand to the ICP ecosystem.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-03-29 14:20:30 UTC | #46

It is sad to see the amount of frustration from people. This SNS doesn't aim to take any funds from the NF or the community. This is a transition of a token to a dao. Why push back on teams that are willing to not take from the community and still give ownership for just holding a nft?

This can lead the way for more nft projects to create value for holders while becoming a DAO. 
If this did aim to raise funds from the NF and or the community through a sale then it would be a different story. 

Opinions aside look at the proposal. It doesn't affect our funds, it doesn't take from the NF, it doesn't affect anyone's bags. I say give motoko a chance and lets see where it goes.

But now you are saying there were internal discussions about $MOTOKO before this? I was under the impression that the idea and implementation were all done within 24 hours. 

I‚Äôm trying to follow your timeline which is as follows, please clarify:  

January 10th: Conception and discussion with Jon Ball, Sonic, Andrew, Lomesh (and Kyle?). Green light given.
January 11th: $MOTOKO announced through X accounts.
January 30th: $MOTOKO airdropped.

Sneed | 2024-03-29 14:30:08 UTC | #51

We can confirm that MOTOKO DAO/accumulating.icp has contacted us to use a fork of SneedSwap for their project to eventually convert NON-SNS to SNS tokens.

The Sneed DAO Founding Team is happy to support the ICP ecosystem in general and appreciates all community builders and developers.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 14:35:56 UTC | #53

I believe this situation is being misinterpreted - we‚Äôre not asking for development resources from SNEED, however we did ask about their opensource codebase. There is already a developer working on forking it.

There is no need for the proposal you‚Äôve linked.

-------------------------

In this case, the money is not being collected, it is being given away. DAO is being created to breathe life into the collection and the fading ICP ecosystem. It will allow those who are still here to work together to create something useful for the community, and gradually increase the value of all their Motoko assets (at least).

But they revitalized the collection and the community, and gave hope to many that in the future, collectively, we could build something meaningful. You, for example, have not done that. Personally, I don't know you at all and I don't understand why what you write should have any weight to what we are trying to build here. 
If you don't want to help the community, don't. There will be other people who will agree to help. I don't think your lack of help will be a serious blow to us.

Your timeline is correct, it was discussed ad nauseam in the Motoko discord. However, the airdrop is still ongoing. Sonic completely botched it. They double/triple dropped tokens to some accounts and then they set up a claims portal.   

From what I understand NFT holders can still claim the token. The last distribution delivered March 1st:  https://ic.house/address/2tlvc-vqaaa-aaaah-adwxa-cai/114ee5d373d1333288bb6bdd9bc6a417e61617579d629a04f31477c5815c98ea

I'm going to suggest that people go ahead and get over their ChatGPT pre-judgments. 

Given the international makeup of our community, it is a godsend for communicating with each other. 

Also, expecting developers to have the marketing skills of marketers or marketers the technical chops of developers when we are launching small and understaffed projects will lead you to disappointment. These tools provide the opportunity to avoid many mistakes.

Its output is only as good as the operator, and of course, you want to be careful, but with the advancement that GPT 4 and Claude have seen over even the last couple months, you'd be an absolute fool to not run almost anything you've done through it to ask for advice and to clean up your likely horrible prose. (it is probably a fireable offense to not do this at this juncture) Just don't tell it to try to be Charles Dickens. Ask it to be concise, technical, and straightforward in its output.  Proofread the response and correct it when it is stupid or flowery.

We have resolved all the issues and successfully dropped over 6500 tokens to NFT holders. The full process is transparent and anyone can check this.

It seems that only 6000-7000 $MOTOKO tokens airdropped, so what happened to the remaining tokens?
Is it come under treasury or burned ?

The claim page will remain active under control of the SNS. 

Unless otherwise determined by the DAO, in the future, Motoko holders (during snapshot) will be able to access the claim page, claim their pre-SNS $MOTOKO & convert it in the 1:1 Swap to post-SNS $MOTOKO.

Go check their white paper.

Antony | 2024-03-29 17:40:48 UTC | #81

Why don't you guys use this unclaimed token to raise funds and will be used for future development(if any) and marketing?

-------------------------

Antony | 2024-03-29 17:44:48 UTC | #83

Then why this guy (jon) joined in the custodian list? lol

Motoko the token hasn‚Äôt actually produced anything. Accumulating Icp has no code

Someone else deployed a icrc2 standard.

Accumulating needs another team to dev the dapp for your daos nns.

Why don‚Äôt you just put the dao on taggr?

I hold zero motoko tokens. I hold a motoko nft.

The internet computer protocol user ‚Äúaccumulating.icp‚Äù is not responsible for the financial certainty of my nft which was commissioned by Dfinity.

I am taking umbridge with this attempt to have everyone else do the work but somehow a bunch of twitter influencers are now gonna be the beacon of motoko
[/quote]

DAO / the project is in its infancy. Who organized this movement, this initiative? You? No.

The Taggr project has a terrible and inadequate team. Some of its members are open Russophobes who do not accept dissent.

Many people have Motoko NFT, but I was not talking about the fact of possession, but about creative activity within the community. Your activity is zero.


"The internet computer protocol user "accumulating.icp" is not responsible for the financial certainty of my nft which was commissioned by Dfinity."
 
But what he did gave NFT even more meaning/content and value + increased potential. You didn't do anything like that. He is going to develop the community and the project. You will not do this.

What's the point of everything you write? Do you enjoy damaging other people's initiatives?

Your disagreement is based on bias. Obviously, in our world, in projects, not everyone writes code. Some are responsible for promoting and organizing activities, and some code. I will repeat once again - your claims are absurd.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 17:47:11 UTC | #85

The screenshots he‚Äôs provided are old & state he did not participate in the genesis of the token, he simply gave permission. I‚Äôve been in communication with Jon since, and he will be participating as a custodian of the initial voting power for the 1:1 swap to occur.

All custodians will make public verification posts.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-03-29 17:46:57 UTC | #87

The whitepaper was in reference to you asking about the AI use on ICPSwap documentation for sns sale.

-------------------------

Enom | 2024-03-29 17:49:17 UTC | #89

Jon wasn't involved in the token creation itself, but he is in the community and wants to develop it with everyone.

-------------------------

Antony | 2024-03-29 17:50:17 UTC | #91

Thankyou for the clarification, I think a tweet from Dfinity will resolve all these issues. Unfortunately Dfinity twitter management team is very bad, they don't know which subject/project to promote/mention.

-------------------------

Enom | 2024-03-29 17:50:53 UTC | #92

It's the only thing you can do for the community :) Thankfully we have other people who are more creative than you :)

-------------------------

At this point you‚Äôre just spewing off topic misinformation & it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculousüòÇ

$STACK is a governance incentivization tool of ICP.

$SNEED is seemingly a blank slate development hub. 

Do you even know what you‚Äôre saying right now..?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 17:57:57 UTC | #101

Thanks for putting forth a proposal regarding our ability to fork SNEEDs opensource code‚Ä¶ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

-------------------------

Enom | 2024-03-29 18:00:13 UTC | #104

If I were him, I'd sue you for defamation. Is there actual evidence that he stole anyone's money?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-29 18:00:15 UTC | #105

DFINITY reccomended I reach out directly to SNEED - now you‚Äôre upset I did?üòÇ Nobody is asking for SNEEDs development resources, an inquiry was simply made about the codebase. 

This is why we have trouble growing this ecosystem.

-------------------------

Enom | 2024-03-29 18:54:03 UTC | #108

Our ecosystem is in decline. She went into a steep dive long before this initiative. So everything you've done before can be considered useless.

The DAO will do whatever it wants. And I think it will be more effective than you.

-------------------------

3dock | 2024-03-29 20:28:25 UTC | #109

Heck yeah! this will be fantastic. Thanks for all the hard work! Custodians are picked well.

icpswap is deeply engaged in the ecology and benefits the ecology. This is a meaningful project that consumes a lot of money. And what does motoko token do?

-------------------------

ishaaqziyan | 2024-03-30 06:21:10 UTC | #113

daijianlin | 2024-03-30 13:13:44 UTC | #114

It's very simple, this $motoko just want to be a DAO, the ones who have $motoko will support it, I am one of them, I will vote YES since I have both $motoko and $icp. 

I believe $motoko will somehow drive $ICP ecosystem moving forward, I also own $sneed, I believe $motoko will help $icp ecosystem in some way with the help of the DAO community since this is driven by motoko ghost NFT that is very cute.

Different ppl have different opinions, that's good. BUT, the ppl who disagree as well as agree, please just use "I" rather than using "we". If just one person, how can you stand for "we"?

The people who criticize @Accumulating.icp, I want to ask you, if you own one $motoko, did you do something for the community? if you did not even own one $motoko, why are you so angry with a project that want to be a DAO that did not collect 1 $ICP?

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-03-30 08:34:17 UTC | #115

[quote="Junkfarm, post:45, topic:29052, full:true"]
I‚Äôll be voting Yes. This token has the potential to make a difference and bring lots of people together for the greater good. I see $Motoko being pivotal for ICP like MakerDAO, to add a reliable brand to the ICP ecosystem.
[/quote]

Yes, everything is possible, the DAO is just the beginning. Using the motoko ghosts cool guy to attract users in someway.

All I can do now is vote YES. I am guilty that I just can do this.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-03-30 09:41:38 UTC | #116

I will vote YES, Hope $motoko could be the great brand in the near future with the driven of a DAO. Since only after that (as a DAO) we can vote.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-03-30 09:42:51 UTC | #117

The ppl want to reject, please note that, the community just used the motoko ghost nft to drive a coin, the motoko ghost on the market is for more than two years, they were just sitting there for more than two years that truely from #dfinity, they were and are not creating a brand new coin, if you have a motoko ghost nft, you will get one $motoko. 

Motoko NFTs are so cute and from the foundation and for free firstly, they may have value with the help of community's driven of course since every NFTs need the driven from the community. Why you did not get one in very low price? because you don't like it and don't think it will be huge someday? then you are here to angry?

You could vote No, but if you are very angry, seems that $Motoko rugs you?

daijianlin | 2024-03-31 01:49:25 UTC | #122

Truth be told, It is weird that some ppl just come here to complain and be angry, if they really hope ICP ecosystem and Motoko to be great, should they provide some feedback rather than complain and angry, so they maybe just jealous since they don't have any $Motoko and Motoko Ghost. Since if they have any, I believe they would like to provide constructive comments rather than complain even be anger.

For those ppl I would suggest you to buy one(1) Motoko ghost NFT if you have enough $ICP or maybe just 0.01 $motoko then you will not complain as well as be anger again, maybe you will then try your best to provide constructive comments.

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-03-31 11:05:27 UTC | #123

I have 25 Motoko NFT‚Äôs. You can find some of my points in the official Motoko Discord. Start here and read the posts from ‚ÄúICP Investor‚Äù.

I would expand more here however my posts are being censored.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-03-31 12:12:21 UTC | #124

Did you receive the exact number of $motoko if you really own 25 Motoko Ghost NFTs? The ones I know were receiving the exact $motoko. All of my account that have Motoko Ghost NFTs were well receiving the exact $motoko.

Some of the dfinity foundation remembers are keeping an eyes on this, why only you are so angry with this? Are you smart enough on the investment world?

I tried to comment however I‚Äôm being censored. Other accounts had their comments deleted. As a result I‚Äôve opened another thread and will present my case there:

-------------------------

diegop | 2024-04-01 16:28:15 UTC | #137

Just to make sure I follow:

1. No comments have been deleted by moderators, so no you are not being ‚Äúcensored‚Äù by any moderators.

2. The system *hides* comments when they they are sufficient flags from other users, but they are still viewable if a reader clicks on them. If they get enough flags, the comment is only clickable for viewing if a moderator approves it. This is all automated.

3. I cannot restore an account since no account has been removed. But I could be wrong from my looking at the moderator queue. What account are you referring to?

4. It seems you did post your thoughts on a separate thread. So not sure what the problem currently is? It‚Äôs reasonable some users find some posts are invalid or out of topic in a certain thread but valid in their own thread. 

Please correct if I am way off base.

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-01 16:40:06 UTC | #138

Thank you for the clarity.  

‚ÄúCensored‚Äù in the sense that 3 of my comments were flagged as spam and hidden. Which users flagged my comments? Please see my thread for more details.   

There is no problem if I am permitted to present my case. I opened my thread as I could not participate here. Additionally, please mod users who break the ad hominem rule. I am simply going to mute them, however they will spam the feed if left unchecked.

I am slightly confused.

This user account joined 3 days ago, has 11 posts.

I am not aware of any ‚Äú20 comments‚Äù rule by the system. how did you get the message that you have 20 comments? Are you sure it was not ‚Äú20 CHARACTERS‚Äù (all posts require 20 character minimum).
