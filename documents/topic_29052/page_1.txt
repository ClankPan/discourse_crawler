I received a message that said “New accounts within 24 hours can only have 20 posts” or something to that effect. I could no longer post. Who was modding at the time?

That sounds like an automated messsge by the system. Mods don’t manually review number of posts. The system has many default rules and catches for spam protection. Likely hit one of them.

Motoko doesn't necessarily need a DAO. It depends on the specific goals and needs of the project. DAOs should be implemented with clear intentions and respect for original creators' work.

Well, the goal, same as $stack token where accumulating held the majority, is a way for the Twitter influencers is to dump motoko nfts on us as the other users have pointed out.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-04-02 11:43:04 UTC | #150

The $MOTOKO supply was distributed across Motoko Ghost NFT Holders - anyone who owns $MOTOKO, was airdropped or bought it off the open market. If you don’t see Motoko as the bluechips of ICP, that’s okay, but many others do - it’s not about “dumping” or people wouldn’t spend thousands of dollars on a single Motoko.

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-02 12:06:38 UTC | #151

You did pump and dump and I will present the evidence in my proposal to reject $motoko.   

Why did you try and censor me on this thread? I have counted at least 6 of my comments which were hidden as you flagged as spam.

My comment was aimed at the person complaining about the use of AI. I was asking them if they cared this deeply about a token not taking money from the ecosystem then did they care to raise the flag that a project that is aiming to take money didn't bother to write their own papers?

I feel it is a fair question to raise to understand if this person has a personal issue with the original poster on the motoko token or has a genuine concern about the use of ai to post proposals.

Natchohodlr | 2024-04-02 17:58:29 UTC | #155

Ok.  I see your the same TROLL that was in Motoko discord and posted pics of you blocking them until they kicked you out.  You didn't hold any Motoko or $motoko tokens then and highly doubt you do now.  
TROLL ON LITTLE MR. CLOWN.  :clown_face:

Move on or do something productive.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-04-02 18:02:09 UTC | #157

Let me get this straight.
You are attempting to dox an unknown wallet and just claim it is his.

You wont even dox your wallet to prove you hold a stake in motoko.

You’re issue is personal with accumulating and has nothing to do with the sns sale.

Which by the way the sns sale cost the community 0 icp.

-------------------------

Natchohodlr | 2024-04-02 18:03:23 UTC | #158

Well you are shit posting with a different addenda than what is being discussed or trying to be discussed here.  You should be censored.

-------------------------

Natchohodlr | 2024-04-02 18:11:18 UTC | #159

You would never show your wallet while trying to call out other people in chat with their wallet addresses and purchases.  Nobody believes you any more. Your have burned out every one in chat with your neurotic behavior.  That is why you were banned from the community.

-------------------------

Henry_Suso | 2024-04-02 18:26:05 UTC | #160

The sns sale is to empower two random twitter influencers with an sns using a community dfinity logo as their token. 

By this logic I am launching the offical Dfinity dao token called $DFINITY I’m doing an sns

SamDrissi | 2024-04-03 14:31:54 UTC | #169

Hi, great article, i have 3 questions pls:

**1. Technical Implementation:** How does the SNS DAO utilize ICP's features for decentralized governance, specifically in terms of technical integration and execution?

**2. Community Involvement:** Could you detail the mechanisms that ensure community involvement in governance decisions, especially concerning tokenomics adjustments and project direction?

**3. Security Measures:** With the transfer of canister control to the NNS, what security measures are in place to safeguard against unauthorized access or malicious proposals within the DAO structure?

Thank you,

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-04-03 15:40:43 UTC | #170

This is an extremely weird angle to have. 

So by dropping a token to nft holders you have came to the conclusion that this is all about two people on twitter?

I do not think there will be common ground with the people on this forum but I do hope you are able to understand ICP is a permissionless platform that includes the ability to propose sns sales. You are free to launch whatever you want.

-------------------------

Dragonixx | 2024-04-03 22:36:02 UTC | #171

I fully support this!  Building a strong SNS DAO for Motoko is crucial if we want to keep pushing the boundaries with  Motoko Ghosts, Mechs, and the upcoming Sentinels. This DAO empowers the community, fosters long-term growth, and ensures transparency in how we build the future of Motoko together!

Without DAO we are limited to few things we can push as a community. Also I want to say that guy ICPInvestor was spreading fud in the Motoko Ghosts Community Discord and I don't think anyone can him take seriously.

-------------------------

ICPInvestor | 2024-04-04 09:25:59 UTC | #172

These are great questions. 

Can @Accumulating.icp address them please.

-------------------------

Andrew93465 | 2024-04-04 17:18:18 UTC | #173

In my opinion this is not just a good idea, but a necessary thing.  Motoko is a symbol of the Internet computer ecosystem.  Development and control of the brand is necessary and will be useful to the system.  In addition, this is a good business, it seems to me that you need to manage not only the name and colors of the brand, but also the image of the ghost, since many create clones and try to use their projects under motoko. Good luck!

-------------------------

Henry_Suso | 2024-04-04 17:24:02 UTC | #174

I don’t think any developer is gonna listen to rules of a dao run by a couple of twitter influencers on what they can and can’t do with an open source computer language anthropomorphized as a ghost

-------------------------

Andrew93465 | 2024-04-07 15:40:54 UTC | #175

and where is it stated in the description of the dao that they are going to control the programming language?  As I understand it, we are talking about brand marketing.  A programming language is a technical aspect that is beyond the dao.

-------------------------

Henry_Suso | 2024-04-04 18:30:56 UTC | #176

What is a motoko ghost? Certainly it wasn’t conceived as a token? Who holds the majority lp of the current motoko token? Who started the initial lp? What is the wallet address?

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-04-05 17:53:45 UTC | #177

@diegop can you advise please. 

@Accumulating.icp has not responded for 4 - 5 days. They have completely deserted this proposal and are refusing to answer basic questions. 

At this point we will be just spamming the feed if we continue without any response. What is the standard procedure in such instances?

To add my 2 cents, Dfinity created the brand around the Motoko language - the logo and the name etc, so I think they should perhaps advise or share their thoughts on this contraversial situation, if it is actually an issue

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 02:07:35 UTC | #187

Apologies for delays in providing the source code & .yaml - below you will find attached both sources, as well as a rework to the $MOTOKO SNS Plan.

https://github.com/sonicdex/motoko-dao-sns

Token Distribution
      - Total token supply - 10,000
      - Allocated to treasury - 9992
      - Allocated to decentralization sale - 4
      - Allocated to developer neurons - 4
      - The ledger transaction fee is 0.0001 MOTOKO

Decentralization Sale
      - Min participation - 1 ICP
      - Max participation - 2 ICP
      - Min participants - 50
      - Max participants - 100
      - Min to be raised - 100 ICP
      - Max to be raised - 100 ICP
      - Request of the Neuron Fund | 0 ICP
      - Duration - 7 days

The original intended plan has a primary point of failure upon testing; it is not possible to airdrop more SNS tokens to the “developers” than being sold within the sale, meaning it is necessary sell at least an equivalent quantity of tokens. 

Below you will find the wallet responsible for custodying these 8 tokens to ensure they’re not claimed within the SNS (4 $MOTOKO for developer neurons & 4 $MOTOKO to be sold).

https://ic.house/address/2tlvc-vqaaa-aaaah-adwxa-cai/ahxa4-bgf6o-7ffvk-as4bw-flo3d-utmbz-iglj7-qofai-7dz2t-75ohg-oqe

Additionally, it is worth noting that of the selected custodians, those who have submit a $MOTOKO balance for their corresponding neurons are: 

https://x.com/bobbyo_?s=21&t=p9K9YrK2DF2OD_cPX2QYTA

https://x.com/accumulatingicp?s=21&t=p9K9YrK2DF2OD_cPX2QYTA

Below you will find the repository for the 1:1 Swap Code, of which can not be completed until an SNS Ledger ID is provided. This work will be completed by conclusion of the SNS sale, at which point the canister will be added to the SNS. A proposal will then be required to transfer the $MOTOKO balance from the treasury, to the 1:1 Swap canister to begin actuating the exchange. 

https://github.com/sonicdex/motoko-swap

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-02 02:29:13 UTC | #188

You are doing a decentralization sale of 4 tokens when the total supply is 10,000?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 02:45:32 UTC | #189

The total supply was airdropped to Motoko Ghost NFT holders - the 9996 other tokens are not the DAOs to sell. 

The 4 tokens to be sold enable the SNS initialization (as you can’t initiate an SNS when selling less than “developers” are reserved), and were donated out of personal wallets to ensure distribution is correct (as again, 4 tokens have to be sold and they have to come from somewhere).

Following a successful SNS sale, a 1:1 Swap will be enabled allowing existing $MOTOKO holders to convert their holdings to the SNS token.

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-02 02:49:40 UTC | #190

Ok, so say you sell the four tokens. SNS initialized. But then what? Where can I find the whitepaper for the newly established dao? Is there a goal to use the SNS for something other than promoting this token? I see you are going to do a 1:1 swap for current holders but then i'm lost. Thanks

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 03:00:42 UTC | #191

$MOTOKO is a community initiative, with the goal to bring awareness to Motoko as a whole. 

The SNS is necessary to establish a DAO to control treasury’s, canisters & provide a decision making framework. 

Following the 1:1 Swap, governance participants are going to have to elect a user to continue existing discussions with DFINITY in regard to past Motoko Collections, and collectively determine the best path forward in marketing the Motoko brand.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2024-05-02 03:34:21 UTC | #192

I'm really unimpressed by this. The generic flowery language that was obviously written by an LLM is only making it worse. Is there a business plan? Or some long-term plan (vague allusions to a plan don't count) to build something that's actually useful? Otherwise there's zero reason for this to be an SNS.

-------------------------

icnerd | 2024-05-02 03:37:48 UTC | #193

so 1$MOTOKO is nearly 300$ in value ???

What's so special about the token ??

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 03:54:35 UTC | #194

It’s a bit odd because half of the community is upset that I’m a “dictator” in determining distribution details, while the other half is upset that I’m not “planning the future” for them😅

$MOTOKO is a marketing initiative for the Motoko branding, aiming to raise awareness for the coding language, collections, and ICP as a whole, as Motoko is the “mascot” - which it has successfully done to date. 

Achieving an SNS opens avenues that are not available to $MOTOKO as a centralized entity:  

There are active discussions with DFINITY representatives in regards to the Motoko DAO managing previous collections; royalties, canisters, and the IP right associated, but this is something that has to be continued via elected official after the DAO is implemented.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2024-05-02 06:23:52 UTC | #195

Regardless of what the community thinks, it's undeniable that you've positioned yourself as a thought-leader and therefore have more power than the typical individual who might want to invest. Influence is immanently relevant even if it can't be as easily measured as direct voting power.

While I'm not totally opposed to the idea of using Motoko as a means of advertising the merits of ICP to the general public, I am wary at the possibility that this is being done as a cash-grab, leveraging the popularity of the Motoko brand WITHIN the ecosystem. Rather than a genuine, long-term commitment to the growth of the ecosystem. That's why I'm asking if you have a detailed and actionable long-term plan in mind. Because in my eyes there's zero reason for the token and its associated DAO to exist without that. Vague references to discussions with Dfinity representatives are not sufficient.

-------------------------

Junkfarm | 2024-05-02 12:06:59 UTC | #197

Once we have the SNS initiated $motoko will be a true DAO and the holders will be able to enact meaningful decisions and marketing to show other blockchains that ICP users have their shit together and the community stands behind it's projects. We need to show the crypto community we can make a difference here on ICP

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 15:17:28 UTC | #204

Have you even read through what was provided..? 

We were planning to use the Sneed Swap repo provided by @Snassy-icp & the @Sneed team but @RMCS opted to create his own due to what was seen as a simpler way to create the codebase. No hard feelings with them, it more so a personal preference on his end.  

I assume this is Tendys based off the bitterness, so no, we did not even look at your repo.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 15:19:14 UTC | #205

Motoko is much larger than a coding language - represented by 3 DFINITY-released NFT collections; Motoko Ghost, Motoko Mechs, and Motoko Sentinels.

There are many avenues to be explored in regard to marketing & user acquisition for Motoko & ICP.

Didn't knew that the DFINITY Foundation released these NFT collections themselves. I missed all of them🥲

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-02 19:06:57 UTC | #211

I know you’re desperate for some form of recognition, but you should probably do some research before making a fool of yourself😅

Originally, Stephen of Toniq labs volunteered to complete the development work. However upon claiming it'd reached the testing phase, we stopped hearing back from him. DFINITY then requested that we used the SNEED Swap, hence why we reached out to them. This obviously didn’t work exactly as planned, so it was necessary to build it from scratch. 

If you refer to the forum post, you’d notice that development credit was provided to @RMCS & @Sneed . 

In regard to $STACK, I’m not going to go off topic with you, but you clearly have no idea about what’s going on there, as it’s a governance incentivization structure for ICP. It’s odd, because I’ve personally talked to @Sneed about this comparison you constantly make, and even they don’t understand it🤔

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-04 03:06:59 UTC | #222

Nobody is trying to govern the coding language. $MOTOKO offers a marketing initiative for the Motoko brand as a whole, which includes 3 NFT collections & a coding language.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2024-05-04 04:09:54 UTC | #223

All concerns and bickering aside, if/when the DAO gets access to royalties for marketing purposes I'll be submitting a proposal to commission hundreds of e-girls to take photos with Motokos drawn or stickered to themselves. This is a clutch marketing opportunity and not one that should be passed on. Pass this idea on to the relevant parties.

[quote="icnerd, post:221, topic:29052, full:true"]
are you guys the core contributor or the original developer to the motoko language ??
How is it possible for you guys to create a DAO and make decision over the language?

1.  They are not.  Not at all.

2.  Great question!  I wonder the exact same thing!  (To be clear, they do not claim any decisions over the "language"; rather, they are simply stealing the brand of the language and doing a shameful cash grab, all in the name of "mulitiple NFTs".  Pretty F'ing sad.)

Nice work! I’ll be eagerly anticipating it.

1. Huh?

2. Why?

I'm sincerely confused.

$MOTOKO offers a marketing initiative for the Motoko brand as a whole, which includes 3 NFT collections & a coding language.

Huh.

Do you even believe this yourself?

How shall the Motoko team and contributors get involved with this cash grab exactly?  By giving some of their cash, on top of their existing contributions that actually matter (The language itself, and everyone using it and building on it).

I know that, I just wanted them to admit that thing themselves to aware others out there.

Okay, great to have a common understanding of this sad situation.  Sorry to sound like I was "informing" you earlier.  Oops.  I apologize for not understanding earlier.

So now, how will you get lost integrity back?
Sincerely: How?

Once you figure out the real game of life (living with integrity), you'll start to see how someone like myself (or anyone else whose spent time actually building on or with Motoko) would feel about this "project".

Good luck for real.  I wish you the best in your upcoming spiritual journey.

Did you ever build a swap dapp?

@Accumulating.icp: is there a proposals group on OpenChat for Motoko SNS, where we can vote on the proposals from OC?
