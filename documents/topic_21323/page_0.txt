If you deploy a Rust canister (Azle/Kybra included) with an "empty" candid file:

```
service : () -> {
}
```

but your canister accepts `init` or `post_upgrade` params, then deploy will fail because dfx doesn't seem to detect or encode the argument. Why is this?

dfx seems to do a lot of Candid inference in other places such as during `dfx canister call` method calls. Having an empty Candid file like above doesn't break all method calls, so shouldn't `dfx deploy --argument` work similarly?

This is causing issues in Kybra because of some complicated build issues we're having around the Candid situation on the IC for Rust/custom canisters. Just bringing it up.

If you want to bypass the type check, use `dfx canister install --wasm a.wasm --argument '(init args)'`
