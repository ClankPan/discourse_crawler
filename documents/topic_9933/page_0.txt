I was following the thread to create an account Id given a Principal (and sub-account) in order to interface with the ledger canister: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-get-the-account-identifier-from-principal-in-motoko/4080

I was using this repo for account Id: https://github.com/stephenandrews/motoko-accountid.git
It returns a `[Nat8]`, and now I need to convert that to an account Id. The repo mentions to use the "hex library" to get the final Text representation, but I'm not sure what library to use.

I've tried both https://github.com/enzoh/motoko-hex.git and https://github.com/kritzcreek/mo-hex.git, but both seem to be outdated?
