Greetings, ICP community! In this post, we'd like to tell you about the Raters app, and our ambitious but awesome goal to build a Web3 platform for movie lovers around the world! 

![Raters screenshot|690x345](upload://9wbTsGWjbUEcufiDoJwC0MFU1VC.jpeg)

Raters is a SocialFi ICP blockchain-powered platform designed for movie lovers, offering a space to share reviews, ratings, and discover films based on both personal and community preferences. With Raters, you can share your thoughts, rate movies, discuss them and get smart recommendations â€“ on only one platform, no matter if youâ€™re a Web2 or Web3 user! By integrating social elements and personalized recommendations, Raters enhances the movie-watching experience through community-driven insights.

### Raters Web3 advantages

To ensure the influx of Web3 users to the platform and to engage more Web2 users in the world of Web3, Raters is the first among similar platforms to offer authorization through two methods that operate on the ICP blockchain - NFID and Internet Identity! These universal Web3 methods allow users to be assured of their account security and help provide additional anonymity regardless of the device they use.

Additionally, Raters writes every movie review from a user whoâ€™s connected one of the ICP authorization methods into the ICP blockchain! This allows Raters to secure and validate reviews, meaning such movie reviews will never be compromised or tampered with by anyone, rather than just storing them in a database like similar Web2 applications do.

### How is it built

RatersApp is a blockchain-based SocialFi platform designed to enhance the movie-watching experience by integrating social elements and blockchain technology for transparency and security. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of how our project is built:

**Frontend**
The frontend of RatersApp is built using React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript. These technologies were chosen for their robustness, scalability, and ability to provide a seamless user experience. Next.js facilitates server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO. TypeScript ensures type safety and better developer experience.

**Backend**
The backend is primarily developed in PHP using the Laravel framework. To handle blockchain-specific tasks, we use a Node.js service that interacts with the Internet Computer (ICP). NestJS is used for building efficient, scalable server-side applications. This combination allows us to leverage the strengths of both PHP and Node.js, ensuring robust backend services.

**Blockchain Integration with Azle**
For our blockchain interactions, we use the Internet Computer (ICP). We chose Azle for developing our smart contracts in JavaScript, as it aligns with our existing tech stack, allowing for faster implementation and easier integration with our infrastructure.

Azle is specifically used for the "canister" repository where we write smart contracts. The choice of Azle was driven by our familiarity with the JavaScript ecosystem, enabling us to leverage our existing expertise for efficient development. Although Motoko could have been an alternative, using Azle allowed us to avoid the learning curve associated with a new language.

**ICP Blockchain Libraries**
We use several key libraries for integrating with ICP:
* @dfinity/agent: For interacting with ICP canisters.
* @dfinity/identity: For managing decentralized identities.
* @dfinity/candid: For defining and validating data types in ICP.
* @dfinity/ledger: For retrieving wallet addresses using the fromPrincipal method.

**User Authentication**
User authentication is handled via NFID and Internet Identity. The frontend sends authentication requests to the intermediary Node.js service, which verifies the user's signature. This service ensures secure and reliable user authentication by validating signatures provided by NFID and Internet Identity.

**Database**
The backend interacts with MySQL for traditional data storage and ElasticSearch for search functionalities. MySQL is used for storing user data and reviews, while ElasticSearch enables efficient search operations across the platform.

**Security**
Data encryption services are employed to ensure the privacy and security of user data during storage and retrieval. Robust security protocols protect interactions between the frontend, backend, and blockchain.

**Summary of Key Technologies**
* Frontend: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript
* Backend: PHP (Laravel), Node.js, NestJS
* Blockchain: Internet Computer (ICP), Azle
* ICP Libraries: @dfinity/agent, @dfinity/identity, @dfinity/candid, @dfinity/ledger
* Database: MySQL, ElasticSearch
* Authentication: NFID, Internet Identity
* Security: Data encryption services
By leveraging these technologies and design principles, RatersApp provides a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for movie lovers to share and discover reviews.

### Internet Computer superpowers
For sure, we use 3 IC superpowers! We have NFID and Internet Identity as 2 secure methods of authorization to allow Web3 users to connect and be a part of the international cinephile community, and at the same time we help Web2 users to touch the Web3 world with ICP.

The third superpower is the ICP blockchain we use via our canister! As mentioned above, we write movie reviews to be transparent and true so every user can check it directly in the blockchain and be assured their reviews are never going to be compromised.

### Go-To-Market strategy
To attract users, weâ€™re going to user different strategies for Web2 and Web3, as Web3 is a new direction for Raters, and we do already have 250k Web2 users we would like to meet in the new Web3 world. Below you will find complete list of our strategies for Web2, Web3, and for Web2->Web3 converting!

**Web2 strategies**
* Content marketing: blog and SEO Optimization.
* Social media marketing: we have social media channels with over 100,000 followers. Of course weâ€™re going to use it to collaborate with influencers and movie critics.
* Referral program
* Paid advertising: Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and other channels. Retargeting included too!
* Community building: to increase Raters user base, weâ€™re going to participate in movie-related communities, and host online events and/or Q&A sessions.
* Email marketing
* Partnerships with theaters and streaming services (and we already do have some)
* User-generated content to involve more users to be part of the community.
* Events and promotions: host contests related to movie premieres and run campaigns around major releases to catch a piece of hype.

**Web3 strategies**
* Leverage blockchain technology: very soon we will introduce token rewards and promote even more blockchain-based transparency, some of it we already have thanks to ICP. :)
* Community development: create and nurture a Web3 community through social media and Web3-related influencers.
* Conversion/onboarding of existing Users: weâ€™d like to educate current users on Web3 benefits, and simplify Web3 adoption by offering incentives for Web3 transition, including bonus tokens and exclusive content.

**Converting Web2 Raters to Web3 Raters**
* Onboarding process: weâ€™re going to allow users to create or link their existing accounts with Web3 wallets during the sign-up process providing step-by-step guides. And! Provide token rewards for users who complete their Web3 onboarding, encouraging more and more users to meet the Web3 world. Of course, that all should be covered by user-friendly UI/UX, with clear navigation and intuitive design. We also think about incorporation of gamification elements to make the Web3 transition process fun and engaging, such as progress bars, badges, and leaderboards.
* Educational tips and resources: create interactive tutorials explaining blockchain technology, how it works, and its benefits for the Raters platform. Also, weâ€™re going to create short video guides and tooltips, pop-ups
* Incentivizing Web3 Engagement: introduce a token reward system for activities like writing reviews, rating movies, and engaging with the community. Mint NFT statuses for active users, rewarding them for their contributions and engagement on the platform. Provide exclusive features and benefits for users who fully transition to Web3, such as advanced analytics, premium content, and early access to new features.
* Community building and engagement: we will foster a strong community on social media platforms and within the Raters app to share tips, success stories, and help each other.
* To be a Web3 user is cool: weâ€™re going to emphasize how blockchain technology enhances transparency and trust in the review process, making their contributions more valuable, and also highlight the benefits of having ownership and control over their data and assets through blockchain.
