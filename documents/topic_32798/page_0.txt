I'm reading and comparing the [SNS.yaml file example](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/sns/cli/sns_init_template.yaml) provided through the ICP portal with recent Snses and I noticed another difference.

The example file (I double checked it's the file on main) contains following:

```
# The amount of ICP that will be contributed to the decentralization swap by
    # the Neurons' Fund if the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal is adopted.
    # This field is specified as a token. For instance, "1 token".
    neurons_fund_investment_icp: ~
```

However most recent Snses are using:

```
# Whether Neurons' Fund participation is requested.
    neurons_fund_participation: true
```

I guess the latest is correct and the repo of the foundation is not up-to-date, is that a safe assumption?
