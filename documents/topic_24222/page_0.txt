ICP's recent rally has been truly inspiring. Many holders around the world have continued to buy ICP even during the darkest days. At the same time, I have heard some opinions and voices from communities around the world, mainly from the perspective of ICP marketing. I would like to summarize these views here to see if they can help to continue to promote ICP's influence in the next six months.

From the perspective of marketing, there are several key processes that are very cost-effective:

**ckBTC growth → ckETH growth → stablecoins entering the IC → rosetta API completion → CHAT and other excellent SNS projects gradually entering CEX**

This is a positive feedback loop of marketing stimulation. Each link will help ICP to gain more attention and bring more users to the ecosystem. Moreover, it is low-cost and efficient. Dfinity can lead the community in each link to bring more liquidity of ckBTC and ckETH to the IC mainnet. The cryptocurrency market is the most competitive market in the world. If Dfinity can personally lead the community to lay out these marketing plans, I believe that the demand for ICP from cryptocurrency users around the world will grow exponentially.

Hope to hear some better suggestions, thank you for reading.

They could also create a song/video similar to what Microsoft did with the Rolling Stones for the Windows 95 launch.
