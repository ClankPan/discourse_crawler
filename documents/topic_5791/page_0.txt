I created an erc20 token using the Awesome dfinity site. I want to store the token in a wallet like ethereum metamask. How to store an erc20 token in a wallet. For example, I created an erc20 token in ethereum then I put the contract address in metamask add token then I get the token. How to do this in Motoko. Is this possible here? Can anyone help me?
