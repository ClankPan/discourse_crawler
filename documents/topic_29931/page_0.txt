Hi, I wanted to work with the chunking api to install chunked code into my canister but turns out there are multiple versions of the candid interface existing simultaneously.

The [IC Spec Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-candid) and [dfinity/ic](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/hs/spec_compliance/ic.did) github repo seem to have an outdated version compared to the [dfinity/interface-spec](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/blob/master/spec/_attachments/ic.did) repo.

Reference: https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pull/272

The IC Interface [specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec) has been updated at internetcomputer.org.
