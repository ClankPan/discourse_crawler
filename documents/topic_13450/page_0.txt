I feel like a public testnet would be the perfect place for testing multiple canisters that will reside in different subnets.

But in the meantime: is there a way to spin up multiple subnets locally? Specifically I wanted to test and maybe benchmark message throughput distributed among canisters, and I think Iâ€™m hitting the (limit?) ~1000/block for a subnet.

Maybe using multiple docker containers?

Hi Rudy,
