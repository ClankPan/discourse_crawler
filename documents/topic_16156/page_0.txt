Dear ICP Community,

Diego from DFINITY here.

We at DFINITY Foundation have seen a lot of questions regarding two community-authored motion proposals recently. On behalf of DFINITY, I would like to address them as best as I can.

## The Relevant Motion Proposals

The two proposals are:

1. [#80970 Spam Prevention - Convert from system-based rewards to voter-based rewards](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970) by [Skilesare.](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/skilesare)
2. [#86639 Temperature Check: NNS Treasury](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/86639) by [dfisher](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/dfisher)

## #80970 (“Spam proposal”): Why DFINITY Voted YES

As Bjoern A from DFINITY [noted in the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/120?u=diegop), DFINITY voted ACCEPT on #80970 (Spam Prevention) because it would reduce the spam by removing the incentive to create spam.

## #80970 (“Spam proposal”): The Controversial Parts

This proposal on its face is not controversial, but it does have some vague wording that many in the community saw as potentially malicious. So it is worth explaining what the intent was.

To be blunt, There was a section that arose much controversy:

> A result of this proposal will be a reduction in total minted ICP due to the fact that some voters do not vote on all proposals or follow a voter for all proposals. In a follow-on proposal, the NNS can determine what to do with that **“abandoned” ICP.** We suggest an NNS treasury but will leave it to a future proposal to finalize that. The following illustration shows the handing out of rewards in the old vs new system.

This section was vague enough that it allowed the following interpretations to be read by some folks:

1. **“Abandoned ICP” implied that there would be maturity created or ICP minted or rewards that would have gone to non-voters**, but instead go to some sort of slush fund or dark pool of crypto.

2. There was a comment by DFINITY about [tracking “unallocated rewards](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/26?u=diegop).” Some people interpreted it to mean that DFINITY agreed with creating rewards and moving them somewhere else to some other fund.

3. There were follow-up comments by both the proposal’s author and others in the forum about potentially using these undistributed rewards to fund decentralized work activities.

The misunderstanding is obvious in hindsight so we want to clarify our intent and the proposal itself:

1. **The Spam proposal actually decreases rewards** - The spam proposal deliberately is intended to NOT create rewards or maturity. This means that under the actual proposal listed, there would be now much fewer rewards created per day (a drop in rewards or minting). Some users think it could be up to *250,000 less ICP per week* entering circulation than before. We expected lots of folks would see this as a win/win.

2. **“Unallocated ICP” is not created in rewards or minted** - [As Bjoern noted](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/120?u=diegop), the intent of the spam proposal is that the system would keep track of the metric (purely for academic reasons) of how many rewards it did NOT create that day. Why? to see how much spam proposal change made rewards drop. No new ICP. No “slush fund” as some mentioned. It is entirely for metrics (imagine dashboards).

3. Yes, the proposal and proposal’s author kicked around the idea of an “NNS treasury” that could be funded from the ICP not minted, but in the same breath, they noted that this was out of the scope of the spam proposal itself. We, DFINITY, took the proposal at face value and considered it outside the scope of spam proposal and voted accordingly. If the proposal had considered NNS treasury to be a prerequisite or part of the proposal, DFINITY would have voted NO most likely.

##  #86639 (“NNS treasury”): Why DFINITY Voted YES

As Bjoern from DFINITY [noted](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/temperature-check-proposal-introduce-nns-treasury/14994/15), DFINITY voted YES because the motion proposal was merely a temperature check to see if the conversation should continue.

We voted YES because we did not want to discourage people from discussing technical or governance topics. We thought that if we voted NO or ABSTAINED it would be tantamount to snuffing out the fragile flame of discussion within the community. After all, DFINITY members have been largely absent from the conversations around NNS Treasury. We like seeing the community get involved more and more.

## #86639 (“NNS treasury”): The Controversial Parts

As DFINITY has noted in [previous explanations of its votes](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-58907/12868), it tries to follow certain guidelines in its voting. To summarize, the guidelines are:

> In order to elicit a YES vote from the Foundation. We would like to see at the very least proposals match the following criteria:
> 
> 1. **Tangible** - The proposal should be understandable and concrete. A proposal that is “make the world a better place” is not tangible enough.
> 
> 2. **Achievable** - The proposal should be something DFINITY believes is achievable. This means that a proposal to “make the IC consensus protocol be faster than light” would not pass since we do not believe science can make it work.
> a. Furthermore, there should be a “path from proposal to code running on the IC”. This means that an NNS proposal to add a copy on the NNS Frontend Dapp to help new stakers would be valid… but an NNS proposal to “ask entity X to change their website to help new stakers” would not be valid.
> 
> 3. **About the IC and In the interest of the IC** - The proposal should be about the IC and of interest to the IC.

This Proposal was a tricky one even for our subjective tests because it was debated how much it met this criteria. For example:

* **Tangible** - the proposal is very tangible. It is about whether the community should continue the dialogue and exploration? It is not something like “solve world hunger.”
* **Achievable** - It is very achievable to participate or NOT participate in the discussions around the NNS treasury.
* **About the IC and In the interest of the IC** - The proposal is very much about the IC, not say “world hunger.”

One could argue that it was not tangible to “continue a conversation”. That, we think, is a very fair rejoinder and reasonable. We made a subjective call that it was tangible enough but reasonable for folks to disagree.

**Lastly, we do think we made a big mistake in our voting:** unlike other votes, we did not communicate in a timely manner what the “*vote meant and did not mean.*” [In previous votes](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-58907/12868), we communicated what we wished to convey (and not convey) via our votes. We did not do it this time and we think this was a mistake. We will certainly try to do better here.

Regarding
**“Abandoned ICP” implied that there would be maturity created or ICP minted or rewards that would have gone to non-voters**

That is not how i understood it.
No voters no rewards no maturity and thus no extra icp. This reduce the circulation which is the core idea of the proposal.

It was also discussed about the idea to keep the inflation high as if the non voters actively vote and use the extra icp to pump up the treasury fund. In other words using inflation to pump up the treasury fund. This was not part of the temperature proposal, but an idea which should be dicussed / decided in a follow up proposal.

Correct me if im wrong, but this is how I understood it and maybe a lot of other people too.

This is correct. By " **“Abandoned ICP” implied** I meant that some people interpreted that way... but your earlier statement is correct.

> It was also discussed about the idea to keep the inflation high as if the non voters actively vote and use the extra icp to pump up the treasury fund.

This was discussed as an idea, but the spam proposal itself says this is a separate matter to be discussed at another time.

You are right this was discussed in the forums, but the proposal itself considered it separate to be discussed at some other time. That is how we at DFINITY read it.

Several of us tried to clarify this on twitter too... great that you were able to clarify it! 
is excellent news !! everything that reduces inflation and does not change the apy for those who actively participate for many years (like 8), is welcome! :fire: :muscle:

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-25 22:43:42 UTC | #8

Good afternoon Diego! Hope you are well today.

I can understand where the DFINITY Foundation comes from in regards to how they’ve voted on the proposals, however I think the “controversial” part is a bit misdirected @DFINITY. From my perspective, it seems as though there’s a distrust between the proposing party, and opposing party, in regards to this treasury. I’m sure there are a few reasons for this, but I believe a lot of it comes from the NNS Treasury Townhall - “the proposer, is the voter, is the beneficiary”. Just redflags as to what *could* happen, not necessarily what will or is. 

So I just have a few questions regarding DFINITYs opinion on the situation;

1. What is their stance on a proposal manufacturing a circumstance to be “solved” by a secondary proposal down the line.
2. What is their stance on multiple “agendas” being pushed within the same proposal? (ex, Spam proposal, but it doesn’t completely address spam - it reduces inflation & creates abandoned icp)
3. What is their stance on a treasury using funds that were redirected from the reward inflation schedule, to fund a seperate foundation, opensource libraries, nonprofit projects, etc.
4. The periodic followee reset proposal passed 6+ months ago, does DFINITY plan to implement this proposal , or will it be left to the community to write the code for this?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-25 22:56:53 UTC | #9

Good question.

> 1. What is their stance on a proposal manufacturing a circumstance to be “solved” by a secondary proposal down the line.

From DFINITY's POV, the first proposal did not create a problem to be solved by a second. From DFINITY's POV, the spam proposal can stand alone. The default interpretation is that of spam proposal is that there is just less rewards created. If DFINITY thought a second proposal was NECESSARY to implement the first, it would have not have voted on the first.

[/quote]

Well Spam proposal does reduce incentive for spam...and it potentially reduce inflation. To give a ridiculous example, if the spam proposal ALSO helped the IC become more environmentally friendly, that would be nice but it was only judged by DFINITY on its intended goal... and the cost of implementing it. If implementing it, would make the IC slower for example, DFINITY likely would not have accepted. If the author had an agenda to reduce inflation, so they used a proposal that reduced spam to get it... it would not matter as much as one thinks. Some people submit proposals to be famous, some people submit them for improving the IC, some submit them to improve their token holding, etc... That is ok. What matters is the proposal itself IMO.

AFAIK, DFINITY does not have a *philosophical* stand yet. We can say we have not seen anything that will improve the IC.

Good question. No clever answer. Just harsh truth: the NNS team is working on SNS to the wee hours and this has sucked the air out of other NNS-related work. That being said, some DFINITY leaders brought this up recently (last week at a planning session) and we intend to catch up on it. We need to do better here when things get under the gun.

Thanks Diego,

It’s a very late hour here so please excuse me if I’m not very clear or if I’m a bit too blunt.

Things I expected Dfinity to address and raise concerns about…Maybe even offer disclaimers before voting YES:

- the entire concept of “abandoned ICP”. 
- the mention of using “abandoned ICP” for anything else other than it’s intended purpose - rewards. 
- tracking “abandoned ICP” - I get academic curiosity but we could’ve determined the amounts retrospectively and it would have been way less problematic. 
- the treasury proposal in its entirety as it links to a forum post that is providing a lot of details on what the proposers have in mind for it.*
- the obvious correlation between the spam prevention proposal and the treasury proposal

* Are links in a proposal not considered part of the proposal? 
*What is Dfinity’s stance on the links in the treasury proposal? 
*What is Dfinity’s stance on the idea proposed in the forum post linked by the treasury proposal which put forward the notion of using “abandoned ICP” to fund the incorporation and operations of a not for profit foundation?

I was disappointed to see DFINITY voting YES for both proposals without anyone batting a eye at all the points above.

Our stance was only what the "temperature check" proposal asked: 

Yes, we would like to *continue the conversation in the open.* We do not want to be the ones who shut the conversation down. If proposal said "what do you think of this NNS treasury idea?" we would have voted NO.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-25 23:01:17 UTC | #18

Yes, the spam proposal both disincentivizes reward spam, and reduces inflation. However it’s opened a third avenue, by the tracking of unminted rewards, for others to suggest to use the (and i say this out of irony) “abandoned” ICP for the purpose of a treasury, and in fact it was even alluded to in the proposal itself. 

So does this imply the agenda is only relevant if it will affect network capabilities?

Yes, i think its clear that proposal #2 (NNS Treasury) can be built on proposal #1 (Spam)... but I also think NNS treasury does not need spam proposal to exist. 

Nor did we think that Spam proposal would create a "check mate" scenario where we (the IC community) painted ourselves into a corner where we needed to do some half-baked NNS treasury idea.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-25 23:10:00 UTC | #21

Not so much that it was a checkmate scenario, but it was an opportunistic scenario that created a convenient “out” for where the NNS treasury would get its funding from.

**This is a hard one, but perhaps not for the obvious reasons. I will speak for myself (*not DFINITY, since DFINITY only judges the proposals themselves*). I realize I may be in the minority here, but you did ask for my frank opinion:**

1. I know @dfisher personally (the author of the NNS proposal). I also know @skilesare (author of the spam proposal). I believe they want the best for the IC and ecosystem. 

2. I saw some people on socials say (as you have), "*These people really wanted an NNS treasury... so they created an idea to reduce spam to make it palatable to the community.*" 

3. I do not see any foul in someone submitting proposals that are complementary because I believe I have agency, just like community has agency to decide. I can like one and not another. I believe community can equally choose. I also don't find anything wrong with people thinking about idea X and being inspired by it to have idea Y. 

4. I know some people found NNS treasury distasteful, but I take a more objective opinion of "I don't think that works" and move on. I try to treat all the ideas with same intellectual openness and frankness.

5. Do I think authors were trying to fool me (as a voter) into going in a certain direction? No, I do not. They openly discussed their intent and biases. I was able to see and choose. I think that is fair play, even when I disagree. 

Am I a foolish man? Perhaps @Accumulating.icp . I am a man who sold most of his ETH in the lowest of the bear market 2018, so clearly I am no genius, but I will at least be honest.

-------------------------

AndraGeorgescu | 2022-10-26 00:07:11 UTC | #23

The proposal states as follows:

*This proposal is a Temperature Check of the NNS governing body to better understand if there is general support for the NNS Treasury idea that has been in deliberation in several locations including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lastmjs/status/1577491377339871233) and the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/a-call-to-action-using-the-nns-for-growth/15839).*


It says that the treasury proposal wants to see if there is support for the treasury idea that has been deliberated on twitter and in that particular forum post. It is not as vague as you imply. It specifically links to what treasury idea they mean. 

So I would like to reiterate on my original question: Did Dfinity consider the references as part of the proposal when assesing it? Was the information linked in the proposal considered in Dfinity’s decision-making process? After all it was explicitly specified that the links describe the idea.

Yes it was. Our intent is simple: we voted to keep the conversation going. The links were seen as examples of the conversation.

We did NOT vote to approve a half-baked idea (which was not even in the proposal itself). No offense to the proposers, but idea is clearly still in progress.

Is it fair to say “You guys misunderstood the intent of the proposal”?

yes, @AndraGeorgescu  I do think that would be reasonable. We voted how we interpreted it, which we explained.

This claim is asinine and in bad faith. Clear evidence has been presented that the proposal was originally written months before any mention of an NNS treasury entered the public conversation. (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-covert-from-system-based-reward-to-voter-based-reward-to-implement-an-accept-quorum-mechanism-and-to-return-the-reject-cost-to-1-icp/12813) It was reraised at the urging of dfinity to combat a forthcoming problem with exchange rate proposals going away. The inclusion of a mention of a possible use was a last minute addition to placate a feeling that there would be RESISTANCE to lowering inflation. The proposal solves the problem it indicated it was trying to solve and provides broad benefit throughout the ecosystem via reduced inflation and reduced spam incentives.

You must also believe that I implemented the same mechanism in the Origyn governance canister in November of ‘21 to set up a grand plan to hatch an NNS treasury 12 months later.

If you still feel that the proposal was a scheme or underhanded please feel free to reach out to me and I’ll be happy to have a personal conversation with you.

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 00:47:38 UTC | #26

No offense Diego, but I’m not sure what conclusion this is supposed to draw. I stated that it was an opportunistic scenario, and you’ve started your rebuttal by crediting the proposers, and then went on to make a blank statement like #2 (I’m assuming to discredit me in some way?😅🥲). In regards to #3, I’d agree we’re all very capable, and competent enough to decide how we vote. However, on the NNS, that isn’t how it works, as a majority of voting power is delegated to Named Neurons, out of convenience, and to maximize rewards. So it doesn’t typically spark a true community-wide discussion, and the formation of opinions on proposals like you’ve mentioned - it comes down to what names neurons decide & agree with. I’d also agree that inspiration for proposals, from proposals, can be a great thing, but in this scenario, based off the fact that the treasury was mentioned in the spam proposal, it appears as though this was strategized, which feels almost ingenuine, if that makes sense? I strongly agree with #4, and hope we continue to have such a vocal, and evergrowing governance “table” going forward. In regards to #5, I agree with this, but it’s only applicable to those who follow the governance + forums. Which unfortunately only tends to be DFINITY, Developers, NN, and other dedicated governance participants (from what I see atleast, but to be fair I’ve got my fair share of forum catch-up to do). So if we wouldn’t have made such a big deal as we did about this scenario, most people wouldn’t have even known this proposal existed. However I think this just circles us right back into the decentralization of voting power issue though😅

I’d never call anyone so dedicated to the network foolish, and I hope you can appreciate the honesty in return❤️

I think that is very reasonable. To be honest, one take away I have is that I don’t think the “temperature check” really hit its intent because of many things you said. I frankly regret we (Dfinity) voted on it before communicating our intent, and I will certainly ask we think twice before voting on any more “temperature check” proposals.

I think you are right in many ways.

This is where I think the proposers got “damned if you do, damned if you don’t.”

They linked to the forums because they wanted to be overt about their intent. Was that enough context for most voters? I’m not sure it was, despite their intent. Yet it was enough for the proposal’s scope to be called into question (should people interpret the proposal only or consider also the conversations linked?). No obvious answers everyone would agree to.

I think it’s great that the proposal was originally written with the intent to purely address spam / potentially inflation. 

However, surely you can see the conveniences in the situation;

- The NNS proposal reduces inflation, and then starts to keep track of unminted ICP
- A treasury is reccomended within the NNS proposal to use this tracked, unminted ICP towards a treasury
- When inquired about what treasury funds would be used for, only projects that were affiliated with the proposing parties were named
- Proposing parties are also in control of a large % of active, governance voting power, which would be responsible for the treasury

It’s just a scary look.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 01:35:50 UTC | #32

I think this is a great start towards coming to as close to a community consensus as possible on the temperature checks via the NNS.

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 01:49:30 UTC | #33

To be completely honest, I did not do my due diligence beyond reading the NNS Proposal & code, so maybe this is a personal responsibility thing. However, if it comes down to personal responsibility, it should also be the proposers’ to portray their intent within their proposal (which to be fair, they did in this situation via link, but maybe we need forum discussions on all governance proposals before proposing?). But I’d agree it’s really hard to define a scope , because while the intent (depicted through forums discussions) is relevant, the proposal itself is what’s passed through the NNS, so it will be hard to align people with a set of values, as Isaacs “Defining an Ethos for the NNS” shown.

I’ve only started exploring ICP governance in depth recently, and in all honesty should have started earlier. 

Questions I need answers to re: governance 

a) Is it possible for ICP to host multiple governance systems? 

b) If multiple governance systems are possible, how easy would it be to move from one to the other? 

b) How welcome are other foundations that may want to fund projects on ICP? 

Thanks

Hi Diego,

I want to respond to point #2… I consider this to be a clear objective of theirs from the beginning.

If not, why would @skilesare mention his preference to use the “abandoned ICP” to create a treasury in the spam proposal (and several additional times).  How can you present of funding a treasury with a proposal to create “abandoned ICP” if not premeditated?!

@wpb has also indicated his preference as well to use this ICP to create a treasury.

So I really don’t like the framing of this as some of us in the community are misinterpreting their explicit words.

If they aren’t linked then reduce inflation as a result of the change to voter-based rewards…do not allow tracking of “abandon ICP”…and create a separate proposal on minting ICP via higher inflation to fund a treasury.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-26 08:51:54 UTC | #37

You literally mentioned your intention/preference in the proposal.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-10-26 10:09:51 UTC | #38

@AndraGeorgescu your questions to Dfinity are certainly valid, there is a sense in the way the proposal was drafted that its true purpose might be a treasury fund. @skilesare provided an answer by way of a timeline check, but that was not apparent in the proposal draft.
My question to you is that I get the feeling, perhaps mistaken, that you are opposed to the idea of a treasury funded by 'abandoned icp'. If this is the case, I would love to hear why, because @dfisher 's post on the treasury got few responses. As an admirer of Distrikt, your opinion matters a lot to me.
Being a supporter of such a treasury, and this part of the message is not addressed to @AndraGeorgescu specifically, I would like to get a sense of why people are opposed to it, and the messages on the forum so far have not provided that.
One clear negative response is that the proposed treasury would strengthen the hands of prominent named neurons, whose controllers would be able to direct funds as they pleased, perhaps indirectly to themselves. This is a powerful argument, if there are others it would be good to have them discussed.
I agree that named neurons would be disproportionately powerful in guiding a treasury. But if their guidance felt corrupt, would this not be exposed and they would lose followers and their power? It would take time, but followers would gradually switch to other named neurons and we already have a great selection of those.
Secondly, the treasury itself could be withdrawn if enough people felt it was being misused or was not offering enough gains and it would be better just to burn the abandoned ICP. After all, nothing is permanent on the IC.

@mechaquan 
You and @AndraGeorgescu have asked umpteen million times on a wide variety of social media platforms what were intentions were behind details of the proposals and you have been given good faith explanations every time directly from the authors.  Yet you refuse to listen and continue to pound on your own interpretation of intent.  I feel like it has become impossible to have an intellectually honest conversation with either of you.

-------------------------

AndraGeorgescu | 2022-10-26 11:46:46 UTC | #40

Hi Wenzel,

I would like to respectfully disagree. I have listened with a LOT of interest and attention. I have taken time and resources from distrikt to give to ICP governance in order to make sure I understand the situation to the best of my ability and the point of the matter is that all the questions I’ve asked Diego still stand. What answers I’ve received from the proposers have managed only to deepen the lack of trust and add to my worries about the future of ICP governance. 

That being said I would like to reiterate that the questions I’ve raised in relation to this forum post are for @diegop. I wish to know the Dfinity foundation’s stance on this issue not Synapse’s stance(you’ve made your position clear and I thank you for that). 

Also I believe that I am well within my rights to ask these questions of Dfinity.

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 11:47:53 UTC | #41

Goodmorning Ser! Unfortunately, I’m caught up with IRL stuff atm, so I can’t answer as indepth as I’d like, but to name a few, but not all, of my main concerns;

- a current problem has not been accurately defined, that constitutes the need for a treasury
-developers have access to grants, VCs, and soon the community fund. for-profits / non-profits should be routed to the appropriate source of funding, rather than trying to utilize network influence to create new sources of funding
- there is no decentralized, responsible mechanic to manage a treasury. majority of VP% is centralized among a few NN. there is no kyc, and no responsibility. how do we ensure transparency of funds, and that people are held accountable? it seems premature to me.
- i personally have an issue with it, because from my perspective, there is no way it was not premeditated to create “excess funds” via “abandoned ICP”, to have this discussion about a treasury, and provide an easy “out” in regards to where funding comes from.
But let’s not get too distracted with that last point.

This is far too common in ICP across all spaces and it simply kills discussion of very valid and respectful points.

All of us have a duty to ensure the voices are supported and not shut down when its public, respectful and detailed

Hi there @Harpal . Nuanced answer:

a. Yes it is possible for the blockchain to host dapps or DAOs, each of which with their own governance system.

b. There is only one NNS so the NNS can only have one governance system. The NNS, among other things, is the DAO that controls the burning and minting of ICP tokens.

I think my point #2 was really not well written (only half a point tbh), it really makes sense in context with my point #4 and #5 which is basically:

Even if they did... why cant we (the community) just say "not good enough", give some feedback, and move on to other proposals? Indeed that is exactly what happened. We at DFINITY thought spam proposal was concrete and helpful but did not think NNS treasury was.

My honest question @mechaquan is this: 

Why do you think some in the community have met this issue with outrage? Why not say "no need"? Or maybe I am misreading things from the distance of written speech online? This is what has been most surprising to me and I am genuinely asking so I can understand. **I think the outrage is valid, I just want to understand it.** Is it because folks think that a half-baked idea would happen unless they were extremely vocal? Is it because they saw DFINITY vote for the conversation to continue? is it because folks think that a wild idea may be "slipped" past the community unless the alarm is rung?

mechaquan | 2022-10-26 14:41:27 UTC | #48

I can't speak for everyone but I can state for myself that the optics of it do not look good...we create "abandoned ICP" by effectively reducing rewards to voters and then in parallel suggest using these ICP to fund a treasury/projects/foundations.  We are either reducing inflation or redirecting voters rewards.

I wanted to raise awareness to the possibility of misusing the NNS and ask the fundamental question about whether or not we believe the NNS should be used for this purpose...I'm fully aware that it could be used for this purpose...I just strongly disagree that it should be.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-26 14:46:58 UTC | #49

That makes sense @mechaquan .

Fwiw, i think it's totally fair and valid you (or anyone) disagree with any use of the NNS. I think it's valid you (or anyone) raise awareness of this issue. I

Why do you think the dialogue turned nasty and borderline ad hominem? We regularly see design issues we all agree or disagree with. Is it because folks find it was the best way to draw eye balls on the conversation? If you do not have a thesis thats fine, did not mean to put you on the spot.

FranHefner | 2022-10-26 15:22:04 UTC | #51

I don't understand why they keep talking about the abandoned ICP, it was already seen that this idea was not applicable. There is no redirection of anything because those ICPs belong to each neuron and that's it. Let's think about other important issues that are in process, I think we have to stop talking about that because it's not going to happen. A fund financed with donations or something else can be created, but nothing related to the proposal to reduce spam. Thanks a hug to all!

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-26 15:28:56 UTC | #52

I'll try to make one more attempt and bridging where possible outrage may be coming from and why it is completely unwarranted and generally hostile to us moving forward on the IC.

I think the disconnect comes from a differing set of presuppositions about how the NNS works and regulates itself.  I come with drawings!

![image|685x500](upload://9kbabE9gNpR4UrT448vCigQ8NjG.png)


As we move from DFINITY controlling a topic(For our discussion we'll look at 1. Node Rewards 2. Governance 3. Treasury Distribution(speculative), each topic will move from a position where DFINITY controls most of the Voting Power to a position where DFINITY holds a minority of the voting power.  To make this work, in the second position, there has to be a mechanism in place to make sure that, in all instances, short-term value seekers(whether it be legitimate stakeholders looking to cash in, projects that would allocate resources for themselves at the expense of others, or adversarial agents looking to tear the network down) cannot gain control of the network.

How is this done? Skin in the game. We all lock our neurons so that we have to live with the consequences of our actions.  This is the fulcrum that we move around and EVERYTHING in the NNS hinges on this holding true. If this does not hold true then we have no effective NNS.  It is the reason that proposals to shorten staking time or lack of action on a neuron market are so dangerous to our long-term health.

The folks that are outraged need to understand that the people proposing an NNS treasury are operating in this world.  The world looks like this:

![image|586x396](upload://hMFJPJD5MGFiSNsZUsLhhgQBwxb.png)

NNS Treasury proposers are proposing a solution where, in their reality, it is impossible for them to make your worst fears come true because of the inherent configuration of the network.  If the treasury existed, and if they tried to fund themselves, it could not pass unless 1. The network felt the funding benefited the long-term value of the network or 2. Significant Information Asymetrry was introduced to 'trick' the network into thinking that there was long-term value.

My suspicion is that some people are feeling a deep-felt information asymmetry.  This makes sense to me as it is clearly the biggest threat to the network. If you feel that we've purposely created that asymmetry then I'm sure you are pissed and angry.

The way to eliminate your concerns in the future is to eliminate this information asymmetry.  I think having a two-step proposal process would help this considerably.  DFINITY laying out its positions as in this post is important as well.

The other solution is to make sure we violently reject any proposal where there exists a modicum of information asymmetry. @cryptoisgood is embodying this aggressively on twitter with his Known Neuron rejection if you haven't posted to the forum. Is that gating? Maybe, but it is less dangerous than maintaining information asymmetry.

As far as the discussion of the NNS treasury goes, we had multiple posts on it here at the forum. There was one meeting held in person amongst a few people, but I can think of nothing discussed during that that wasn't generally public in the forum.  Fixing this asymmetry is a valid concern, but there is no reason to convert into malice and bad faith.  **The people who considered the idea to be a good one were living in a world where your worst fears were impossible.**  Please consider ascribing them some good faith. If they are wrong our experiment is already doomed.

Until we have better protection against the asymmetry, the only protection you have is paying attention to this forum and other places of discussion.  This sucks because we're all trying to build.  I'm hoping some process is coming out of the working groups that will include proper documentation of discussions, objections, and mitigations.

If we live in a world where we solve information asymmetry then there should be no functional difference between our scenarios 1, 2, and 3.  We shouldn't be able to pass node rewards, governance proposals, or treasury distributions unless the network collectively agrees that it improves the long-term value of the network.

As far as folks that want an ethos or are concerned about long-term value that may overstep moral lines, we are going to have to human our way through that...there is no mechanism currently in place to keep it from happening.  That is scary as hell, but where we are.  This is also worth a deep discussion and consideration.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 15:39:56 UTC | #53

I’m glad you said this Diego! I have a couple questions that I feel were accidentally sidestepped with context, that could be built upon after the discussion we’ve had. 

1. What is DFINITYs stance on a proposal manufacturing a circumstance to be “opportunized upon” by a secondary proposal down the line.


(Don’t wanna re-ask this, but rather build off it, so I’ll provide context :) )

2. What is DFINITYs stance on multiple “agendas” being pushed within the same proposal? (ex, Spam proposal, but it doesn’t completely address spam - it reduces inflation & creates abandoned icp)

Response: …if the spam proposal ALSO helped the IC become more environmentally friendly, that would be nice but it was only judged by DFINITY on its intended goal… and the cost of implementing it. If implementing it, would make the IC slower for example, DFINITY likely would not have accepted. If the author had an agenda to reduce inflation, so they used a proposal that reduced spam to get it…

So does this imply that DFINITY only has issues with agendas being pushed via the NNS if they affect network performance? It seems to also imply that the cause & affect of the proposal is not considered either. Is this a safe voting practice when DFINITY is in control of such a large VP%?

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-26 15:47:45 UTC | #55

Diego the problem has been going on for quite some time.  First, the hyperinflation that has driven the price of ICP to the ground, to combat inflation, the change of totonomics is introduced through the modulation factor and the anti-spam proposal with the aim of reducing inflation and discouraging spam proposals.  5 min later, the same ones that have pushed these changes propose to direct the supposed abandoned ICPs from the rewards of neurons that have never voted to create a treasure that apparently is decisive for the survival of IC , all under the protection of Dfinity, and Dfinity without saying a word.  The community is not stupid, it is IC's best asset.  The community wonders what the hell is going on?  What are we missing that we don't know?  are we so screwed?  oops!!  I forgot, and while all this is happening, the only thing that occurs to a representative of Dfinity, (@Herbert) to give voice to a supposed member of the community on Twitter to debate whether it would be a good idea for seed investors to sell all its exchanges at once, canceling the unlocking schedule, arguing that this way new investors would be more attracted to buy ICP.  after a drop since its launch of about 99%.  Honestly, the community is very burned and angry with the feeling of lack of control and lack of clarity, communication and leadership that it is seeing from Dfinity.  Giving the feeling (which I'm not saying is true) that a ship adrift, save yourself.

mechaquan | 2022-10-26 16:00:56 UTC | #56

I think you are asking me to give a thesis on human behavior :slight_smile:  maybe we can have a nice thread on Taggr about this I know @radudaniel would love that! :slight_smile: 

What I do know is there are always some characters who will use bombastic and sensational language to get attention and make a point...and for lack of a better explanation it works.

I simply asked a direct question of several individuals who expressed to me publicly or privately what their beliefs are.  There is no point in talking around the issue...if people believe the NNS should be funding projects directly we should make those beliefs transparent and known.

I think I've been pretty consistent on what I believe the role of the NNS is...which is to remain completely agnostic and manage the protocol which includes not requiring a NNS vote for naming a neuron or launching a SNS.  

Years from now once adequately decentralised we can have real debates about tokenomics such as should we increase/decrease inflation, node provider subsidies, dev cycle costs for computation and storage, transaction costs, etc.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 17:20:37 UTC | #58

I’m skipping over most of this, as I’m not to interested in the speculation of human psychology part, but to address the important stuff;
To claim that any party is prevented of committing malicious activity by “skin in the game” (in the form of neurons), is ingenuine. And it’s a rather straightforward answer as to why this is the case; Synapse created their NN with 10ICP, and reccomended others do the same - as a means to create a “robust followee system”. Not word for word obviously, but I’m sure you get the point. 

~10ICP is less than 50$ at current prices, and certainly not enough “skin in the game” to prevent malicious activity. 

In regards to ”information asymmetry”, again, this is blatantly false. Voting power is extremely centralized, with two named neurons representing 65%+ of the active vote. So, no, you wouldn’t need to convince the entire network of “information asymmetry”, you’d only need to collude with the other named neuron. 

Is it likely? Who knows. But regardless, it is possible. I don’t think you should be so dismissive of other opinions, because they conflict with your own. I hope you can read these examples with an open mind, as they clearly depict why your examples of “network insurance” aren’t as sound as they seem on paper.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-26 19:11:11 UTC | #59

@esquivada i think you make really good points.

Frankly, this is where my mind is at (due to no small part your post and others):

1. The tone of outrage from some was really about fear and well-intentioned alarm.

2. A lot of the fear was less about this micro case, but the bear market combined with other events. I think that is very reasonable. 

3. I think I tend to have extremely thick skin (perhaps too much) and deliberate short-memory so I discount prior events more than community. This is good because it allows me to “give feedback and move on”, but it’s bad because it some times distances me from the genuine concerns people have. Write ups like you helped me appreciate that.

Thank you.

theguy | 2022-10-26 18:43:55 UTC | #62

1) Tone of Outrage and fear is mostly due to severe uncertainty on the reward system. Its been changed 5 times in the last 15 Months and this is definitely a significant amount 

The closest financial instrument I can compare NNS to is a Bond where you lock up you fiat for X years for X interest. A change in this would be considered a breach

Changing ICP rewards regularly is: 
    a) Causing fear in existing stakers
    b) Turning away any new stakers 
For a sane investor to lock up value for 8 years with the level of uncertainty ICP provides is crazy

Im not even going to begin addressing the treasury since its been covered in heavy detail as to why its not appropriate and won't be appropriate for a few years atleast - something the community is now converging on.

2) Very dismissive to blame it on "Bear market" when people are expressing and detailing their concerns. I keep calling people out on this, its **not acceptable** from anyone, let alone a Dfinity employee. 

What is the point in Dfinity wanting to encourage community discussion if the response is dismissal, generalization and assumption? Is this just a facade for Dfinity to push this through? If it isn't, I expect less assumptions and more empathy

3)  This issue needs more than "Feedback and move on" - Is there some clarity on Dfinitys official stance on this? 

I'm told the reason for a treasury was to create more decentralization but there are strong arguments to this doing the exact opposite at current point, which once again, the community is converging towards 

There are simpler and MUCH stronger cases for: 
1) Followee reset per period 
2) Followee cap 
3) Power cap 

Above with an exception for Dfinity who define their own path to decentralization over a longer period once the ecosystem is functions (and possibly tokenomics are deflationary)


Coming from the best of places, we have arguably one of the smartest communities in crypto (Mostly xD) and I'm hoping we keep this a place where all can thrive

Pardon me, not sure I follow: What do you mean by the “spam proposal problem”?

1. Spam has been a problem for many months because there is economic incentive to create nonsense proposals for rewards. This is independent of any entity or party.

2. Many, many people have proposed spam solutions. We have tried a few. This is just the latest.

3. I don’t see a problem with anyone proposing any solution. Indeed, I welcome the wildest ideas, and try to evaluate them as they are. I argue (speaking for myself, not as Dfinity): ideas should be respected when posted, Questioned, scrutinized, and decided upon. 

What am I missing? It seems I am missing something in your intent, but I’m not sure. 

Are you saying that the recent spam proposal created a problem? Which problem was that? All it did was:

A. Reduce económic incentive for spam by reduce rewards for non-voters
B. Potentially Reduce rewards crested daily

I don’t believe I have done this. I believe I only mentioned bese market once, but really made a point to recognize that previous events eroded some people’s safety so it was reasonable they get more vocal for this proposal than if it was submitted 12 months ago.

What proposal are you referring to?

With one proposal (spam), a community member created it. We gave feedback on forums and then supported it.

With the other (“temperature check”), we communicated we have not seen an interesting version we think Can help the IC, but welcome more discussion.

Well this is odd. There are multiple versions of the NNS treasury idea, almost all of them as works in progress and all of them iterate even within their own forum threads. There are also forum threads on Ethos on NNS.

I think I have been clear on dfinity’s stand: we haven’t seen anything that can help the IC.

Each idea has its own pros and cons, and if you are looking for detailed feedback on each comment or idea, we first need canonical versions of ideas to comment on. 

Does that not sound like a reasonable stance?

@esquivada i think you make really good points.

Frankly, this is where my mind is at (due to no small part your post and others):

1. The tone of outrage from some was really about fear and well-intentioned alarm.
2. A lot of the fear was less about this micro case, but the bear market combined with other events. I think that is very reasonable.
3. I think I tend to have extremely thick skin (perhaps too much) and deliberate short-memory so I discount prior events more than community. This is good because it allows me to “give feedback and move on”, but it’s bad because it domestics distances me from the genuine concerns people have. Write ups like you helped me appreciate that.

Thank you.

The community that lives and feels IC and ICP in its heart, the community that fell in love with Dfinity's vision is the one that has the best perception of the general climate in social networks because it lives in them.  Diego you have to have people who could even be members of the community who observe what happens in the networks and know how to transmit to Dfinity the general climax especially in a bear market.  I honestly believe in your honesty and that of Dfinity but I think your hands are tied because you are busy with other tasks related to development and you do a lot of showing up to the community.  but you should have honest observers dedicated exclusively to that.  To anticipate and know how to stop speculation and misunderstandings in time.  Thank you for your comments

I’m told the reason for a treasury was to create more decentralization but there are strong arguments to this doing the exact opposite at current point, which once again, the community is converging towards

There are simpler and MUCH stronger cases for:

1. Followee reset per period
2. Followee cap
3. Power cap
[/quote]

I dont disagree with this. Indeed, these ideas are usually much more baked for starters. They have also had motion proposals that have passed.

It sounds like you think Dfinity is pushing an NNS  treasury to create decentralization? Did I get your intent right? I don’t think it is. Dfinity thought the opposite: it was not a tangible or helpful version we think can be helpful, specially given other opportunities and priorities.

Hi @Accumulating.icp 👋

Thank you for raising these points.

a current problem has not been accurately defined, that constitutes the need for a treasury
-developers have access to grants, VCs, and soon the community fund. for-profits / non-profits should be routed to the appropriate source of funding, rather than trying to utilize network influence to create new sources of funding

I tried to provide my perspective on this here:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/a-call-to-action-using-the-nns-for-growth/15839/50?u=paulyoung

In summary, some people’s experience has been that the existing options aren’t enough and that there’s a gap for things the community might otherwise like to see funded.

there is no decentralized, responsible mechanic to manage a treasury. majority of VP% is centralized among a few NN. there is no kyc, and no responsibility. how do we ensure transparency of funds, and that people are held accountable? it seems premature to me.
[/quote]

From what I’ve seen, the biggest proponents of furthering a treasury discussion have also been the ones acknowledging these issues the most.

I’m not sure I’d say “premature” but I understand the sentiment.

I’ve also seen how specific use cases without clear solutions can drive innovation in areas that improve things overall, so I think it would be a shame to dismiss ideas and not explore them because of that.

If I'm understanding this correctly

Dfinity wants to make this treasury idea work but is only deliberating on how? 

I am hugely active within the community and speak to a lot of people. Not a single one is able to tell me Dfinity's stance on this so maybe there is a larger problem here than just my understanding

With all due respect, maybe the context got lost.

The question was “why the outrage?” It was not “why do people disagree with ideas.” **I can see why people can disagree with an idea. I asked why the ad hominem attacks on social media and vocal anger**. It was a question about the tone. 

I conceded that this micro case is not in a vacuum. It is amidst a bear market as well as a line of previous micro cases which upset folks so the tone rose with the history and environment. I think that is fair, no?

No.

Dfinity has no plans for an NNS treasury. I see people say this on social media. This is false.

Dfinity only read and made some small comments to OTHER people’s ideas of what an NNS treasury could look like in a respectful way as we do with other ideas.

Does that clear up the misunderstanding?

I can see why you would be upset if you thought that. I appreciate you asking directly with your base assumption so I can address it directly.

[/quote]

For the community members who feel this way, have these community members attempted to raise funds using any other methods and failed? IMO there are numerous funding paths besides VC's and NNS Treasury that could be used to raise funds for the types of non profit projects and initiatives contemplated. 

Look at other blockchains as examples, 

- Ethereum has raised hundreds of millions through Gitcoin grants for community goods type of projects that are not for profit. 
- Crowdfunding platforms NFT crowdfund which recently raised a record amount in it's latest crowdfund. 
- Alternatively SNS could be used for funding these types of initiatives.

All these alternatives voluntary contribution funding routes would not carry the same type of risk that are associated with the creation of NNS treasury.

If these proposed projects were proposed to the IC Community through various independent voluntary funding requests, I would anticipate that funds would be raised successfully to support these efforts.

Perhaps the default approach should be to try these low risk funding routes to see if they are viable options, prior to embarking on the high risk endeavor of NNS treasury and only if they fail and prove to be untenable, then seeking other alternatives.

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-10-26 19:51:45 UTC | #80

I don’t know the details of them all but from conversations I’ve been involved in or heard of, the gist of it is:

* Something native to the IC would be the most aligned with improving the ecosystem.
* The amount of ICP raised across all projects on CrowdfundNFT is fairly low; certainly not enough to attract talent to commit to working on the IC full-time.
* The SNS seems geared towards decentralization sales where those participating expect some sort of return. This isn’t a good fit for a number of things like code reviews, audits, marketing efforts, etc.

skilesare | 2022-10-26 20:10:16 UTC | #81

I'm not being dismissive of your opinions, I'm trying to relate to them and see things from your side.  The information asymmetry bleeds into the Named Neuron system as you mention and it is a problem to solve as well.  You have a good point.

The people that do have skin in the game have selected those neurons.  With a small 4-day voting period and the ease with which one can decide to stop paying attention, it is a risk that those with skin in the game could be creating an asymmetry for themselves.  The skin is in the game, but perhaps the head isn't. I don't have a great immediate solution for this other than to say that by properly diversifying one's following they can protect themselves somewhat.  Synapse is actually 11 people voting.  ICDevs is 6.  By following those two you'd be following 17 community leaders and that would certainly provide you with reduced risk than just following just two.  170 would be even better!  1700 is likely overkill but certainly difficult to bamboozle.  How we get from here to there is important. In the meantime DFINITY has a good bit of pull to overwhelm almost any proposal that gets too far out of line.  It is a lot of trust in DFINITY, but that is implicit already to what we are doing for the time being. We have to make sure we get to proper diversification by the time DFINITY loses that position.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-26 20:11:32 UTC | #82

Is your accusation that the ICPMaximalist neuron PURPOSELY created the spam problem?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 20:18:56 UTC | #83

These leads me into a question regarding DFINITYs grant system, as it’s being portrayed asthough there’s a lack of funding.

 If everyone is so confident the projects in question should be funded , as they benefit the ecosystem, why hasn’t DFINITY allocated more grant funding to opensource libraries, bug bounties, etc? They *claim* to have 200m$ reserved for funding grants. Surely it’s a good idea to use that fund, to incentivize community growth, through the funding of non-profits, rather than for-profits?

The question really is, how much of that 200m$ is left? Grants are paid in the form of ICP - is that 200m$ ICP at Genesis, or 200m$ in fiat?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 20:21:35 UTC | #84

How is a treasury not premature, if we don’t even have a reasonable means to manage it, the people in charge of it, ensure transparency, responsibility & accountability?

Additionally, 60%+ of active voting power is controlled by two Named Neurons. This is nowhere near decentralized enough to put named neurons in control of a treasury, or to use the NNS to elect treasurers.

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-10-26 20:25:48 UTC | #85

The point I was trying to make is that if we don’t even have conversations about ideas like these and how to address the challenges they bring then there won’t be anything to motivate change.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-26 20:27:32 UTC | #86

The point is “who’s skin is in the game”. Because it certainly isn’t the NN that’s in control of the VP% it represents.

And the quantity of named neurons you follow doesn’t do anything, as the NNS doesn’t create a poll of followed NN votes, to vote in accordance to. The first NN to vote, casts the votes. First come first serve. What really needs to happen is the decentralization of voting power, rather than centralizing all voting power across all named neurons.

This is an interesting point. I don’t disagree with you but it does make me wonder if we haven’t lost (or at least significantly deviated from) the original vision statement for the SNS. I thought the SNS was going to be the key to Open Internet Services. Finding way to democratize the development of open source protocols. I don’t see how we do that if these OIS are expected to return some value to the stakeholders.

[/quote]

A proposal has already passed...and we are awaiting implementation...that allows you to change your vote if you disagree with your named neurons...of course, this doesn't help if you don't know the vote is happening.  I think NN is a great way(maybe the only way) to have ongoing liquid democracy because no one has enough time to track all that will be going on if this thing takes off, but it is very very important that people maintain a veto over their NN.  The NN can be powerful in forcing action, but a veto in the back pocket protects the whole network.  We need a good information system that raises an 'alarm' when the need arises for people to review their named neuron's decisions.

The alternative here is to force nodes to put up stake and slash them if they don't follow the rules ETH2 style. Then the governance mechanism becomes rough consensus and running code. No NNS is necessary. I'm starting to think it may be the way to go, but then voting rewards go away too.  After the last week, maybe that is best. :man_shrugging:

-------------------------

Johnchiby | 2022-10-26 20:46:03 UTC | #89

English is not my first language so I'll try this again. 

Did we have a "spam for rewards" problem at genesis? If no, then what I'm saying is that ICP Maximalist created the proposal(s) that started the "spam for rewards" problem. 

In case I am not being clear, here's another shot: There was a proposal(s) made by ICP Maximalist. After that proposal(s) passed it created the "spam for rewards" problem. 

Last try: ICP Maximalist made a series of proposals on the NNS in order to promote governance participation. We started having a "spam for rewards" problem after those series of proposals were made by ICP Maximalist.

I am speaking from memory so I could be slightly off.

Fun fact…that [proposal 38985](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) passed over 9 months ago and AFAIK it’s on no roadmap.

I still think it’s one of the most important proposals we could adopt for decentralization for all the reasons you cite.

If your accusation is that the proposal did in fact create a spam problem, then yes, you are correct.

If you are implying that they created a spam problem on purpose then I think you are incorrect.  One can see clearly behind them, but it would be genuinely unfair and probably giving them too much credit to think that they could cause that problem on purpose.

Good question. The problems did not start at Genesis but very soon after. ICP maximalist had nothing to do with that. In fact, some users actively created proposals just for rewards and wrote their intent in the forum and proposals.

Here is an example post from May 2022 (6 months ago before the proposals in question):

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/blatant-spamming-rewards/13164?u=diegop

I don’t see how ICP maximalist could have created the spam problem so I’m very certain they did not. I’m not even certain they existed when spam started (could be wrong about this). 

Tbh, I’m a bit concerned (not your fault or responsibility so not blaming you) about the ICPM scapegoating for spam when many other entities have submitted spam proposals, but in reality the true problem is that the Tokenomics incentivized it.

Okay, I honestly think you’re mistaken. I’ve been following the NNS, and ICP Maximalist on telegram for close to a year now. I know that ICPMaximalist neuron now Synapse.vote made a series of proposals in an effort to incentivize voting on on the NNS. The spam proposal problem started after these proposals. The only thing I’m not certain about is whether the ICPMaximalist neuron created the proposal that changed tokenomics such that it incentivized spamming. I really hope you understand me now. Sorry for being really slow.

That’s the message that @Ciaran has been preaching.  I’m starting to think he is right.  Indeed, these same governance conversations will occur over and over and over again…especially since volunteer participation is unsustainable, which means that we will see never ending turnover in people who have an opinion to express.  That said I still think there would need to be a way for the people who are receiving voting rewards to earn those voting rewards by some mechanism of performing work.  Otherwise it seems ICP would turn into a security since consensus for ICP is achieved in other ways.

[quote="Ciaran, post:65, topic:16090, full:true"]
Coin voting (shareholder voting basically) for a protocol that aims to represent 8bn people with their myriad of competing interests and morals is inherently fragile.

[quote="Ciaran, post:346, topic:9424, full:true"]
I very well understand the goal of The IC to serve things the other blockchains can’t.

The problem is tokenised open Web 3.0 dApps - the things Dominic keeps shouting from the rooftops The IC was specifically built for - aren’t viable on a protocol with active governance of a ledger by humans. This is *especially* the case for governance by financial interests. States will absolutely not allow this.

So if we’re in a situation where the IC can’t work without governance yet also can’t work *with* governance then I ask the question do we have a viable project here? How is it going to work?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-27 00:25:35 UTC | #98

I think we could still have voting…it would just be voting on the on-chain governance parts like adding to sub-nets, etc. And adding the slash of misbehaving node providers(if it can’t be programmatic). “Governance” would only be through nodes deciding on a replica to run.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-10-27 01:31:57 UTC | #99

Makes sense.  I feel like so much of what I have always understood and believed about the NNS is evolving rapidly in the last few days.  

Perhaps Governance Motion proposals (soft topics) should be a separate system based on POH with 1 person, 1 vote, with a lot less financial reward tied to it so people get a lot less visceral about governance.  

Perhaps the NNS is supposed to be oligarchic, not democratic, and should only be used to govern the protocol. 

Perhaps it would be better to have simple staking, minimal work, and low expectation for active participation.

So much to think about…

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-27 07:36:34 UTC | #100

@diegop I think he is referring to the weighting of the governance proposals from 1 to 20 which is a proposal that ICPMN/Synapse championed and it was this proposal that created the incentives for spam proposal in the first place.

Have you noticed the spam has all but stopped now that weighting was reset?  

But now we have a spam proposal which in my opinion has nothing to do with spam…

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-10-27 08:06:57 UTC | #101

I think I understand this points of view from the current framework perspective. But that does not imply a new governing framework is not possible. We are using a new tool with old thinking patterns. 

Do not understand I have a solution to this, as this is a complex matter. 

This discussion should have a different post and create a new thread.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2022-10-27 08:08:36 UTC | #102

If slashing can't be programmatic the IC's in trouble IMO. If you want to get to play by the rules of autonomous protocols you have to be..... autonomous. If you have humans deciding what's what, expect other humans working for nation states to either bring the system under their control or isolate it if they can't (ban the coin from exchanges, permissioned stablecoins, etc).
