[quote="Johnchiby, post:96, topic:16156"]
Okay, I honestly think you‚Äôre mistaken. I‚Äôve been following the NNS, and ICP Maximalist on telegram for close to a year now. I know that ICPMaximalist neuron now Synapse.vote made a series of proposals in an effort to incentivize voting on on the NNS. The spam proposal problem started after these proposals.
[/quote]

With all due respect @Johnchiby , I am not even sure why you think ICPM made any such proposals.

### 1. I have found more motion proposals from DFINITY on voting and spam and weights than any other entity by far. Here is one that I myself presented on behalf of DFINITY in November 2021:https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172

### 2. Historically: Most (95%) spam or junk proposals came from the **same entity**. If any one actor has produced spam, it was examples like this. Now, to be intellectually honest, they created the spam due to the tokenomics incentives, so I would still point at the tokenomics as the true culprit:

* [random spam proposal #1](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70350)
* [random spam proposal #2](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70354)
* [random spam proposal #3](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52537)

Or even these:

* [test_005 i will keep on submitting garbage proposals for whales until a fix
](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/54693)
* [test_010,ÂìàÂìàÂìà~nice weather today ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55152)

This one even says (openly):

> #### Hahaha, let us assume the increased proposal rejection cost is implemented.
> 
> If you also want to increase your daily earnings, you can donate to my proposal account using the following formula: a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea
> 
> Once a month: [Amount of donations] = [Amount of stake ICP] * 0.01% 30
> Once a week: [Amount of donations] = [Amount of stake ICP] * 0.01% 7
> Once a day: [Amount of donations] = [Amount of stake ICP] * 0.01% 1
> 
> I only need to receive a daily 0.01% maturity donation of 0.05% of the total neurons per day to continue increasing the yield for you.

Just see this list from one period of time:
* [Proposals from July 2022](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance?p=9&t=586&topic=TOPIC_GOVERNANCE)

When you see this, it's pretty clear if there is an entity creating spam, it's NOT ICPMN.

### 3. There was a period where Wenzel created "educational motion proposals" like this one during his "30 days of governance" campaign he did:

* Example: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/45425

Notably it has the section:

> This is the 16th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance. The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting. The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected. For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below. You can also find all past daily governance proposals in this series on the dashboard.

But he only did it for 1 month. Is this what you refer to?

### 4. I do not recall nor can I find ANY motion proposal by ICPMN on this topic that has been implemented.

The closest thing I have seen to what you are saying is two things:

a. ICPMN members have created forum posts or comments on their thoughts on spam and junk proposals. This is not new, MANY people have done this. None really became motion proposals that have been implemented.

b. People on ICPM telegram channel do share ideas, and maybe it appears that these ideas were created by then or implemented.

If I am not mistaken, @AndraGeorgescu , the sentence that 'perhaps the NNS is supposed to be oligarchic' was a lament at the way things appear to be moving in discussions rather than a plea for oligarchy. But @wpb can clarify.

[quote="AndraGeorgescu, post:103, topic:16156"]
it can‚Äôt get worse than David‚Äôs giddy calculations on how much money can be siphoned out of the network and into a centralized organisation
[/quote]

Isn't all this discussion a result of the IC being governed entirely by a centralised entity called Dfinity? It seems a way of getting away from total centralisation. Perhaps the result will still be partial centralisation because of a few named neurons having a lot of power, but partial decentralisation seems better than the complete centralisation we currently have, and perhaps a step in the path to full decentralisation. Maybe I am being naive, I would really like some opinions on the worth of a treasury broadly defined, aside from the intra-community sniping which might be justified (there is so much that prominent builders on the network like you have inside knowledge of) but perhaps also misses the forest for the trees.

Perhaps the NNS is supposed to be oligarchic, not democratic, and should only be used to govern the protocol.
[/quote]

@AndraGeorgescu why don‚Äôt you quote the entire point that was made?  ‚Äú‚Ä¶govern the protocol‚Äù is an important point.  Who do you think does that today?  Not a single named neuron governs the protocol today.  It 100% belongs to DFINITY due to default following on All Topics, and rightly so.  I would not trust anyone else (named neurons or otherwise) to govern the protocol and we are not moving in the direction where anyone else will at this time.  There are no other contributors to the IC and there are no incentives for anyone to go there.  

[quote="wpb, post:99, topic:16156"]
Perhaps Governance Motion proposals (soft topics) should be a separate system based on POH with 1 person, 1 vote, with a lot less financial reward tied to it so people get a lot less visceral about governance.
[/quote]

The previous paragraph addresses the desire for proper democracy.  Token voting on governance is not democracy.  The Synapse.m neuron has zero control over who follows us and we trigger more voting power than a lot of people, including me, are comfortable with today.  Yet governance motion proposals do not govern the internet computer.  They are an expression of opinion only with no enforceable outcome.  Again, DFINITY alone decides if a governance motion proposal will be implemented because only they are contributors to the internet computer.  My point was that if you want to have a voice in governance motion proposals, then we need PoH and 1 person 1 vote system.  That‚Äôs a different system architecture than we have today.  I shouted from the rooftops that we need more names neurons starting back in February and nobody except Synapse, Arthur, and ICDevs stepped up until recently.  Tokenomic incentives drive change as we saw in February.  It will take more tokenomic incentives and more changes to the NNS to drive additional rebalancing of voting power, yet I still don‚Äôt think that will achieve the democracy that we want.  We will have these same conversations over and over and over.  ‚ÄúStop changing the tokenomics.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe need an ethos.‚Äù ‚ÄúX named neuron has too much voting power (which somehow makes them corrupt)‚Äù. Etc etc etc.  I‚Äôd like to see a system that evokes less visceral responses from everyone so people like you and me, as individuals, have a bigger voice.  I created the Synapse neuron with 10 ICP, at the blessing of leaders in the ICPMN, and today we trigger 10% of the total voting power in the NNS.  We have a well rounded, representative mix of voting members, who are well known in the community, who have dedicated themselves to voting with their own convictions on every governance motion proposal in ways that they believe are in the long term best interest of the IC.  Yet, important people like you have arrived at this hatred of our neuron and are perfectly fine with calling us corrupt.  I literally said that maybe we should consider that democracy should come from 1 person 1 vote so every individual has a bigger voice and our governance system doesn‚Äôt have to depend on named neurons that carry a lot of voting power due to follow selections made by others.

It‚Äôs certainly not an NNS take home message that I have read from any official DFINITY literature.

Wow. Why do you take everything as an insult or at face value? I'm talking about your pre-edited comment. We are all adults here and there is no need to throw tantrums. Nobody is attacking you or Synapse, and @AndraGeorgescu has been more than respectful and has only posted well-founded criticism to the current state of the IC governance.

My opinion is the following: It's not a valid excuse to say 'well DFINITY is the big dog and it controls everything!', because if Synapse decides to push for a specific proposal such as the NNS Treasury, DFINITY may be coerced into implementing it in the purpose of maintaining the 'decentralisation' of the network and the usefulness of the NNS.

Nobody is attacking you, yet you seem to react heavily to arguments that put your position in jeopardy.

This idea occurred to me, I don‚Äôt know if it could be debated.
I am not an expert on the subject and excuse me if I mess up due to ignorance, but if we want to increase decentralization and participation in governance, why not widely reward the neuron that proposes a proposal that is finally accepted and implemented by the NNS, those rewards can then be divided evenly by the followers‚Äô ceded voting power (voting power) given to that neuron through liquid democracy.

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from unassigned ICPs), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance. In addition, since the reward is a fixed amount to be distributed, the neurons with less voting power (for different reasons) would be more attractive to the followers since, in the case of proposing and implementing a proposal, there would be more rewards to be distributed discouraging the accumulation of power and encouraging decentralization.

Obviously, this at the same time would encourage the active action of the community to look for the right partner periodically, discouraging passive voting and the stagnation of power that leads to apathy and corruption. for example, before creating a given Governance proposal, a contest of proposals will be held with a certain duration so that the community has time to develop on a certain convenient topic. The winner decided by Nns would upload their proposal to vote to be implemented. if it is implemented then there is a prize. in this way we would squeeze the greatest potential of governance and community intelligence

It gives you a sense of not having a voice. Which leads to this visceral hatred of Synapse that you can‚Äôt get over in spite of the fact that governance motion proposals do not govern the internet computer.
[/quote]

Your edited post reads better than the initial temper tantrum. Nevertheless I would ask you politely to not speak on my behalf. If you think I hate Synapse you are flattering yourselves. I simply do not trust it anymore, and I think the promise of all that money corrupted what was an inspiring vision over how the IC governance should work. 

You even did the math in the forum post that you co-authored with David.

*The potential to raise funds that could be put to a productive use is enormous given how valuable the NNS is ($1.57 billion worth of ICP staked at current value). The proposal to redirect ICP from non-voting neurons could in theory place 1M ICP a month into a NNS treasury without increasing the overall pre-set inflation rate of ICP (10% going down to 5% over 10 years). 1M ICP a month is $6M a month. That‚Äôs a lot of money!*

That is a lot of money indeed and that is exactly why people don‚Äôt see this temp check proposal as casual. Cause it‚Äôs not YOUR money. It belongs to the network. The network is now reacting to your proposal to take it away. I think the right reaction from someone that cares about governance would be to listen with more empathy. 

So you see, Synapse‚Äôs voting power and the state of the IC governance is not what I have an issue with. I have repeatedly and patiently explained what I have a issue with: minting other people‚Äôs rewards to fund a centralized organization and its operations. And you and various other Synapse member have defended this funding mechanism and continued to advocate for it. So we are at a point where our views are very much opposed. Why do you find it an insult if I don‚Äôt trust you or Synapse anymore? After all, blockchain networks have been built around the concept that we can‚Äôt trust each other when it comes to valuable assets, so we need a trustless environment. 

And because I hope this to be the last comment I leave on this forum post, I will explain here again why this doesn‚Äôt make sense to me(I‚Äôve already tried to cover this both on distrikt and twitter.)

The concept of ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù is a huge red flag. If the network doesn‚Äôt find the act of staking without voting valuable it should stop rewarding. Period. If it does end up minting those rewards then it must mean it actually finds the non-voting neuron valuable and that ICP belongs to the neuron whose stake generated the minting of the reward.

Otherwise the system becomes illogical and unfair. Imagine you‚Äôre a newcomer looking to understand why ICP mints rewards in relation to the staked ICP in a locked neuron‚Ä¶but it keeps it for itself and its treasury. We are talking about creating a dangerous precedent. 

Has anyone even bothered to stop and think over the legal implications of such an action? Was a legal advisor consulted? 

I would like to invite you to review the 2-3 comments I left on this forum post and you will see the issues I‚Äôve raised have nothing to fo with your comments.

They are as follows:

-abandoned icp and using it for anything but its intended purpose
-dfinity‚Äôs process of decision-making when it comes to voting on proposals such as these. Which to be frank @diegop I am still not clear if Dfinity considered the links presented in the temp check proposal as being part of the proposal. 

@wpb I hope that brings more clarity and stops speculation about what exactly I am so bothered about and nonsense regarding ‚Äúhate‚Äù. 
Although it seems that no matter how clearly I try to communicate you change the subject into whatever makes you look more like a victim. This is also part of why we have trust issues atm. My hope is that eventually this lack of trust between us will be mended.

if we were able to channel the suggestions of proposals at the objective convenience of the governance through public contests and voting through the nns. we would solve opportunism. on the other hand to those rewards can then be divided evenly by the followers‚Äô ceded voting power (voting power) given to that neuron through liquid democracy.

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from unassigned ICPs), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance.

@AndraGeorgescu just to be clear, the proposal is that those non-voting rewards are NOT created. So it would do exactly what you want it to do. The "unallocated ICP" or "abandoned ICP" was meant to be a number in the NNS that tells us how much was NOT created. It is not minting anything or creating any rewards. Honestly, I believe its harmless, but since its intent was to just keep track of it for historical reasons (and analyzing data trends), I would vote it is NOT tracked because of the political temperature around it.

The temp check proposal that wanted to create a treasury and linked to this forum post that explains the concept in great detail: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/a-call-to-action-using-the-nns-for-growth/15839

I do not think you are "dividing community".

I am saying the data metric may be needlessly dividing the community (I cannot stress HOW unimportant it is to the spam proposal's mechanism), so I would vote to just remove it. It was seen as a metric for data purposes only.

I assumed your reply was about the spam prevention proposal given the that it focused on this.  

*The ‚Äúunallocated ICP‚Äù or ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù was meant to be a number in the NNS that tells us how much was NOT created. It is not minting anything or creating any rewards.* 

This is true only for the spam prevention proposal but not for the temp check proposal. 

The temp check proposal specifies that the treasury concept they are proposing has been discussed in the forum post linked within the proposal itself and it introduces all the aspects of ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù that raise concerns.

You even did the math in the forum post that you co-authored with David.
[/quote]

You are right.  The math was presented as an example of the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù that ‚Äúcould in theory‚Äù fund a treasury.  It‚Äôs a maximum boundary that would not exceed existing governance reward inflation.  It was presented as one of several ways a treasury could be funded.  Unfortunately, we did not also present a ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù option in the funding option list

If the network doesn‚Äôt find the act of staking without voting valuable it should stop rewarding. Period.
[/quote]

I respect this opinion, but the NNS does not pay governance rewards to people who do not vote.  One very reasonable option is to do nothing with the undistributed governance rewards.  My stated preference is to use it to fund people and organizations that can become contributors to the IC.  This is a fundamental difference of opinion.  I recognize my argument is not resonating with the loudest voices.   As such, I have not been advocating that we move forward with the treasury idea.

I assumed your reply was about the spam prevention proposal given the that it focused on this.
[/quote]

Ah fair enough, vague writing on my part.

[quote="AndraGeorgescu, post:137, topic:16156"]
*The ‚Äúunallocated ICP‚Äù or ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù was meant to be a number in the NNS that tells us how much was NOT created. It is not minting anything or creating any rewards.*

This is true only for the spam prevention proposal but not for the temp check proposal.
[/quote]

Ah yes, you are correct. The forum links in the "spam proposal" and the "temperature check" proposal do have different ideas on "abandoned ICP."

To connect a few things I have said under one roof to make it clearer:

1. DFINITY interpreted the "temperature check" proposal to be asking "should conversation continue?"

2. DFINITY did read the links as examples of the conversation. If the conversation was (for example) a lot of racist troll messages, DFINITY would have voted NO. Since the conversation was about legitimate disagreements on IC design, DFINITY voted YES in order to not accidentally kill any open design conversations from the community. We try to encourage participation, whether we agree or disagree.

3. You @AndraGeorgescu  have pointed out in other messages that we DFINITY perhaps misinterpreted the "temperature check" proposal. I think that is a fair and reasonable point. I can only answer how we interpreted it. You may be right our interpretation was incorrect. It was a subjective call so best we can do is be open about how we understood it.

Fwiw, maybe a more interesting question is what we learned about this, and as I wrote above, I think DFINITY learned a lot about how to scrutinize "temperature check" proposals or "should this conversation continue?" or how we communicate it before and after. 

We do not think we did great here. It would be disingenuous to say, "Here is what we did and why it was right." 

More honest version is "here is what we did, why we did it, and why we think it was not great."

I feel apprehensive about even posting this because it seems like this thread has gotten quite heated. I'm still not sure I understand everyone's perspectives but hopefully that's OK.

I'm posting this anyway because I want to encourage others to ask "stupid" questions and feel like there's an environment where it's safe to do that. I hope this is received in the manner it is intended.

[quote="AndraGeorgescu, post:128, topic:16156"]
The concept of ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù is a huge red flag. If the network doesn‚Äôt find the act of staking without voting valuable it should stop rewarding. Period. If it does end up minting those rewards then it must mean it actually finds the non-voting neuron valuable and that ICP belongs to the neuron whose stake generated the minting of the reward.
[/quote]

I've spent some time trying to understand what people mean by "abandoned ICP", tracking it, and all of the concerns around it.

I think what people may actually mean by this loaded and unfortunate term is "the difference in the amount of ICP that would have otherwise been minted" and that's what's of most interest.

Or rather, what the actual inflation value is vs. the inflation schedule that was originally proposed.

***

[quote="AndraGeorgescu, post:128, topic:16156"]
Otherwise the system becomes illogical and unfair. Imagine you‚Äôre a newcomer looking to understand why ICP mints rewards in relation to the staked ICP in a locked neuron‚Ä¶but it keeps it for itself and its treasury. We are talking about creating a dangerous precedent.
[/quote]

From what I've gathered, some of the proposed ideas (like @lastmjs' [funded contributors](https://twitter.com/lastmjs) seem quite logical;

ICP is minted for activity that the NNS deems is valuable. At the moment that is limited to being a node provider and voting.

If at some point the NNS decided that minting more ICP for some other activity was valuable then maybe that could happen.

***

**Questions:**

1. Do people object to that in principle? (introducing new activity and minting more ICP, details obviously important)

    If not, or to at least keep that option open, capping the above to the originally planned inflation schedule seems important.

2. In which case, is keeping track of the ICP that was planned to be minted as it happens the only way to ensure that?

    Can we figure it out retroactively if necessary? Are people also opposed to that?

Hi Paul,

I‚Äôve said repeatedly that I am not at all opposed to the idea of a treasury as long as participation is a voluntary contribution. I have said that I would contribute.That I would be open to donate a % of my rewards to fund important work and would happily encourage others to do the same. But not like this. 

I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt want to be rude but I won‚Äôt make another argument about why I find the concept of ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù so problematic‚Ä¶.I am honestly exhausted. And I have absolutely nothing to gain from all this, only to lose by antagonising important members in our community. Nevertheless, I believe that opposing this initiative is in the best interest of the IC. 

I‚Äôve made my points to the best of my ability.

I would like to remind people to engage in civil discussion. I know Donald Trump was president for a while and that approach seems to get attention on Twitter but I believe we are better than that.

I would also like to remind people that smart people disagree. Smart people with the exact same facts disagree.

Lets encourage disagreement. Lets encourage debate. Lets discourage ad hominem attacks. Lets discourage online bullying and name calling.

Just a reminder we are all on the same team.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-28 10:20:21 UTC | #151

I can think of something better. I want to make it clear that I would not touch the current system of governance.

In the interests of not increasing inflation with the NNS minting rewards from neurons that have not voted, all the ICP of rejected proposals coming from Spam, opportunism or proposals rejected by the community could go to a pot of rewards for the proposals that are accepted by the community.
This would not change the current ROI of rewards nor would the NNS increase the inflation from coining ‚Äúunassigned‚Äù ICP from rewards from neurons that have not voted.

What continue with this?

on the one hand discouraging absurd or spam proposals and encouraging active participation in convenient smart solutions at any given time, and decentralization on the other.

Suppose that the pot of ICP minted from the proposals not accepted by the NNS is 1000 ICP at a given time, then conveniently a neuron X finds an improvement or solves a problem, the neurone X proposes to the NNS and its proposal is approved.
Now suppose that Neuron X has a voting power of 100 ICPs, of which 10 ICPs are from itself and the other 90 ICPs come from 9 other neurons that follow it with 10 ICPs each.
Those 1000 Reward ICPs from the pot would be assigned to the maturity of all those neurons via Neuron X with a 10% weighting for each of them, that is, 100 ICPs for each one.

what can we expect ?

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from rejected proposals), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance. In addition, since the reward is a fixed amount to be distributed, the neurons with less voting power (for different reasons) would be more attractive to the followers since, in the case of proposing and implementing a proposal, there would be more rewards to be distributed discouraging the accumulation of power and encouraging decentralization.

Obviously, this at the same time would encourage the active action of the community to look for the right partner periodically, discouraging passive voting and the stagnation of power that leads to apathy and corruption.

for example, before creating a given Governance proposal, a contest of proposals will be held with a certain duration so that the community has time to develop on a certain convenient topic. The winner decided by Nns would upload their proposal to vote to be implemented. if it is implemented then there is a prize. in this way we would squeeze the greatest potential of governance and community intelligence

Make it clear that those neurons that vote independently following or not a winning neuron of the proposal, will also take their reward +~ predictable by the current tokenomics.

All while being called names like toxic, ingenuine, dishonest, etc. - only to have the script flipped - framing the scenario like we‚Äôre the ones attacking people. 

Quite ironic that we get directed to the forums for ‚Äúlong form conversation‚Äù, only to deal with this.

They may have legitimate concerns but they are expressing them with malice and exercising close to extreme bad faith. It has been worse on twitter than here, but the passive agressive accusation of corruption are completely uncalled for. They are making this an awful place to try to contribute.
[/quote]

The IC governance status quo seems to have had little to no opposition for so long that now they are shocked and insulted that people even question them in a direct and straightforward manner. 

Losing trust in someone or in their organization is not malicious. It‚Äôs not malice or bad faith to believe its intentions may have been corrupted by the promise of the extreme wealth that they can siphon out of the network. Perhaps a better question is: why are these people losing trust in your representation of their interests?

Are people reacting to this proposal the ones making this ‚Äúan awful place to contribute‚Äù or was this achieved by the proposal itself combined with the forum post detailing plans made months ago? 

Funny that you should mention how people are getting discouraged. I‚Äôve spent the last 2 weeks doing ground work within the community and trying to talk important community members out of rage quitting over this. If I sometimes seem upset about this whole mess, it is because I actually took the time to listen to them and their concerns. 

I‚Äôve spent countless hours offering reassurance that this is not as bad as it seems and we can move on from this. I am not the enemy here, you‚Äôve done this damage yourselves and are unable to admit it or make amends. And to be frank I‚Äôm tired of cleaning up the mess this proposal made, at absolutely no personal benefit whatsoever(quite the contrary).

No one - not me, not Synapse, not you, not anyone - has the right to do anything. We have governance structures that approve or deny proposals. And it‚Äôs up to the people that make those proposals to make convincing arguments. If they aren‚Äôt convincing they won‚Äôt succeed. And if the governance structures are broken, it‚Äôs up to people to make proposals and arguments to fix them.

The point of the comment is that I don‚Äôt like how people are treating one another in these forums. Especially people who have devoted significant amounts of their time to make the IC a better place. It wasn‚Äôt directed at Andra specifically. It‚Äôs a general comment.

mechaquan | 2022-10-28 12:37:05 UTC | #159

I agree...I don't like how people who are questioning motives and intent are being called toxic or being accused of ad hominem attacks.  If you believe this is happening please provide specific examples.

A good part of the community strongly disagrees with your proposal regarding 1) the creation of a treasury and 2) how to fund it.

The below is straight from your proposal...

*There are three options to fund such a treasury:*

*1. Increase inflation of all neurons*
*2. Reduce staking rewards from all neurons while keeping inflation constant*
*3. Reduce the staking rewards from only non-voting neurons (or another group of neurons)*

Me challenging you on these ideas is not toxic or launching ad hominem...however you accusing me of that is avoiding a debate on your ideas.

Let me cover each option:
1) ***Increase inflation of all neurons*** aka printing money; this is a bad idea because you are effectively devaluing every staked neurons value via inflation and extracting that value from the NNS to fund projects/foundations/marketing that not all stakers would likely agree on.
2) ***Reduce staking rewards from all neurons while keeping inflation constant***; this is changing the terms to which people staked for 8 years on and involuntarily taking their rewards
3) ***Reduce the staking rewards from only non-voting neurons*** ; this is just not true because non-voting neurons do not get rewards @wpb has mentioned this several times...only voters get rewards

So if you want to continue to debate the ideas I'm happy to do so but let's focus on the arguments.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-28 12:40:58 UTC | #160

I understand your point and in part you may be right but nevertheless I honestly think this is getting too sidetracked. 

it is true that a treasury right now would not be a good idea given the centralization and lack of trust that still exists.  perhaps Synapse's mistake has been to be too pretentious. 

But I think that Synapse  has been a great contributor and important initiator in the IC since everything here is very new, and I really think that they want the best for the ecosystem.  
They did not calculate the suspicions that this could arouse. 
I also think that Dfinity wanted to stay out of it, which is why I voted yes on the temperature proposal. 
I think that in a DAO everything has to be open to debate and discussion since everything evolves, even the most common needs.  for future proposals I think it is very essential that there be three options, YES, NO and Whatever the Majority decides

You proposed: 1) increasing inflation at the cost of stakers value, 2) reducing stakers/voters rewards at the cost of stakers/voters, and 3) reducing non-voters rewards which you know is not true.

I don't think the problem is me recognising an opposing point...I think I'm very much recognising your point... and I strongly disagree with it and I think you don't like that so instead of making your point better you call me sensational or disingenuous.

AndraGeorgescu | 2022-10-28 12:58:39 UTC | #164

I disagree because when the people doing the proposing are the people doing the voting and the same people that would benefit from receiving the ‚Äúabandoned ICP‚Äù‚Ä¶.is it really a stretch to consider that the temptation of all that money and self-interest might have a role to play in this initiative?

**It will be an endless discussion... People imagine that the ideal of governability is among all without anyone at the head, that does not exist and will exist for a few years..**

Or is it vitalik in eth when you propose something, the community does a global vote and vitalik opinion is worth the same as any other?

Charles Hoskinson with ada, propose something and the opinion is worth the same as a person in a forum demanding something because someone bought tokens??


**People assume a lot**, they think that if you vote in favor of generating a discussion space for an idea, you are already voting in favor of getting icp from anywhere or generating icp from nothing, nobody said that... the idea was only voted on in the future to create a treasury but no one voted to take anything away from anyone.

**We as a community influence the voting, but at the moment (and I am grateful for that) the community does not decide all the decisions. That is good because in a new product it can be a disaster,** people believe that by buying tokens they can decide the future... they can give their opinion, they can influence, they can help, but they won't say more than dfinity until it goes away through a long natural process decentralizing, but there is no need to rush, for the beginning, the first years you have to support the foundation that are the ones who know and are building this from the beginning.

**I think @diegop  did an excellent job of communication... let's relax a bit and wait for those who are working for us to do their job calmly.**

Amazing things are coming, let's not lose focus! integration with bitcoin, http calls, hundreds of new projects! we have to be happy about all the growth!

You are right.  We did link that forum topic as an example of of ongoing discussion of the treasury idea, but it was not presented as a concrete idea.  The full proposal text is provided below for easy reference.  It explicitly states that the temp check ‚Äúproposal was not intended to represent any concrete ideas.‚Äù  It also explicitly says it was intended to ‚Äúgauge interest‚Äù and that ‚Äúspecific details‚Äù would be ‚Äúdeveloped in working groups and approved by the NNS at a future date‚Äù.  There were explicit instructions about what a yes vote means.  A yes vote did not mean approval of a treasury, how it would be funded, or how it would be used.  A yes vote only meant ‚Äúyou support further exploration of the NNS Treasury idea‚Äù.

Start Quote - Proposal 86639 motion text:
This proposal is a Temperature Check of the NNS governing body to better understand if there is general support for the NNS Treasury idea that has been in deliberation in several locations including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lastmjs/status/1577491377339871233) and the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/a-call-to-action-using-the-nns-for-growth/15839). **This proposal is not intended to represent any concrete ideas.** It serves to **gauge interest** from the voters about whether the NNS should independently own and control an ICP treasury. **Specific details** around purpose, funding mechanisms, and fund distribution **would be developed in working groups and approved by the NNS at a future date**.

We are asking you to **vote to approve this proposal if you support further exploration of the NNS Treasury idea**. Vote no if you believe the NNS Treasury idea should not be considered further.

Wenzel again, I get all this...and to be honest I wish you would stop repeating it as well.  I'm passed it.  

As stated days ago let's assume this is the start of the working group!

Your proposal to talk about a treasury passed and I'm trying to talk about it...meanwhile the only ideas you've put forward are the ones in that forum post which have been raised by several individuals and then just brushed aside...

So unless we can clearly provide reasons for creating a treasury and funding it then I agree we should just park it for awhile until we achieve sufficient decentralisation and the network matures a bit.

As a result, we will look to establish a working group in the coming weeks. We want to get input from everyone - both proponents and critics of the idea - to see if we can reach a rough consensus and move forward. Hopefully we can but of course it‚Äôs possible we won‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm super excited about the prospect of multiple organizations like Dfinity - maybe 10+ - that can push forward the dream of an internet computer. So many folks are rightfully worried about how centralized voting is today. This is one avenue to help fix that.

I‚Äôm personally ok with inflation that comes from non voting neurons if it‚Äôs subject to various caps.

I know some folks don‚Äôt want inflation from non-voting neurons. Ok - so vote against it! Personally I think we‚Äôll all benefit tremendously if we put up with a limited amount of inflation that only affected folks who don‚Äôt vote. Most arguments against this are based on a hardline principle which I am not convinced by. I‚Äôd prefer to live in a world where the Internet computer wins rather than one where we keep our principles and lose.

I‚Äôd open to be convinced otherwise. So if you‚Äôd like to convince me and others like me, please provide arguments rather than moral principles!

[quote="AndraGeorgescu, post:164, topic:16156"]
is it really a stretch to consider that the temptation of all that money and self-interest might have a role to play in this initiative?
[/quote]

I‚Äôm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to solve this problem.  I suspect you would agree that all three categories of people (proposers, voters, beneficiaries) should always be people who have the long term best interest of the IC in mind.  

My struggle is this‚Ä¶
We have an environment where the community wants everyone to have the freedom to make proposals.  Presumably this also means people involved in named neurons should have the same freedom.  Speaking for myself, I didn‚Äôt create / get involved in a named neuron with the understanding that it would require me to not participate in governance deliberation or make proposals.  That seems counter to decentralization principles if that is a prerequisite to named neurons.

We have a liquid democracy system that allows accumulation of a lot of voting power by small neurons through liquid democracy.  It also gives them no visibility to their follower identities and gives them no power to reject followers or to subdivide the liquid democracy that is cast.  All they can do is vote for what they believe is best and we have to assume that anyone who chooses to follow them is doing so because they trust their ability to make good decisions.

There is also a wide variety of opinions on what it means to be a beneficiary.  Anyone who votes is certainly a beneficiary, but the benefit could come directly or it could come from second order effects (funding things that make the ecosystem grow).

Please don‚Äôt interpret this as me arguing that you are wrong. I agree with your concern, but I don‚Äôt know how to solve it given the governance participation that is encouraged.  I‚Äôm very interested in knowing what you think is the right answer.  I hope for a more nuanced answer than just aligning the three categories of people (proposer, voter, beneficiary), who should all be acting in the long term best interest of the IC, as evidence of bad optics or corrupt behavior.  What is your proposed solution?

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-28 14:57:21 UTC | #175

My solution

In the interests of not  increasing inflation with the NNS minting rewards from neurons that have not voted, a source of ICP that instead of being burned generating very little deflation would be all the ICP of rejected proposals coming from Spam, opportunism or proposals rejected by the community could go to a pot of rewards for the proposals that are accepted by the community.
This would not change the current ROI of rewards nor would the NNS increase the inflation from coining ‚Äúunassigned‚Äù ICP from rewards from neurons that have not voted.

What continue with this?

on the one hand discouraging absurd or spam proposals and encouraging active participation in convenient smart solutions at any given time, and decentralization on the other.

Suppose that the pot of ICP minted from the proposals not accepted by the NNS is 1000 ICP at a given time, then conveniently a neuron X finds an improvement or solves a problem, the neurone X proposes to the NNS and its proposal is approved.
Now suppose that Neuron X has a voting power of 100 ICPs, of which 10 ICPs are from itself and the other 90 ICPs come from 9 other neurons that follow it with 10 ICPs each.
Those 1000 Reward ICPs from the pot would be assigned to the maturity of all those neurons via Neuron X with a 10% weighting for each of them, that is, 100 ICPs for each one.

what can we expect with this?

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from rejected proposals), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance. In addition, since the reward is a fixed amount to be distributed, the neurons with less voting power (for different reasons) would be more attractive to the followers since, in the case proposing and implementing a proposal, there would be more rewards to be distributed discouraging the accumulation of power and encouraging decentralization.

Obviously, this at the same time would encourage the active action of the community to look for the right partner periodically, discouraging passive voting and the stagnation of power that leads to apathy and corruption.

for example, before creating a given Governance proposal, a contest of proposals will be held with a certain duration so that the community has time to develop on a certain convenient topic.
To avoid the opportunistic rush of followers, once the proposal is uploaded by the neuron to the NNS, it will no longer be possible to follow that neuron during the voting process.

The winner decided by Nns would upload their proposal to vote to be implemented. if it is implemented then there is a prize. in this way we would squeeze the greatest potential of governance and community intelligence

Make it clear that those neurons that vote independently following or not a winning neuron of the proposal, will also take their reward +~ predictable by the current tokenomics @Sabr

1. What is DFINITYs stance on a proposal manufacturing a circumstance to be ‚Äúopportunized upon‚Äù by a secondary proposal down the line.
[/quote]

Hi there @Accumulating.icp , apologies for the late reply. It hard to keep up.

Honest answer: **we (Dfinity) don‚Äôt have a stance**. We evaluate each proposal for what it does, costs, benefits, how concrete it is, and it‚Äôs possible outcome. 

Could we create such a stance? Yes, we have many policies (usually when something happens many times). And we also have many things we judge on a case by case basis.

**My personal opinion:** 

I suspect and assume (but could be wrong) you are asking this because you believe spam proposal was created as a way to make idea of an NNS treasury more palatable. Quite frankly, I see it different for multiple reasons:

A. As I have written before, I don‚Äôt foresee a situation where a player ‚Äúcheckmates‚Äù the community and paints them into a corner. I think that is highly unlikely.

B. The players all played fair. They all listed their biases and intents. You may disagree but they were open about what their biases were and **the spam proposal even called out their bias, while making it clear it was not part of the proposal**. I think that is fair play in an open debate.

C. The spam proposal is valid and in and of itself. There have been many, many, many spam proposals. Many have been evaluated. Most rejected. Some have passed. **Each spam proposal opened up both costs and opportunities because it created trade offs, to me this is just another proposal that opened doors and closed doors in a long line of them.**

D. I think judging and investigating biases is a rabbit hole. The best thing we can ask for is that people be honest about their bias (which authors were) and for the community to actively read and judge the written proposal at hand. 

E. I personally don‚Äôt judge in any moral manner WHY anybody proposes something on forum or to the NNS. I like best to evaluate it for its benefit to the IC, give feedback if I can, and move on. I do this because i want to be a welcoming community to the wildest ideas and the dumbest questions. This personal tenet is important to me.

David, I‚Äôve made many counterarguments and you ignore them‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll summarize:

- I agree it would be great to have 10 foundations driving the development of the IC
- What‚Äôs stopping us from creating those foundations?  Funding?
- So your suggestions/arguments are to create that funding by extracting value from people who have bought and staked ICP on the NNS via inflation they won‚Äôt benefit from and/or lower rewards.

I‚Äôm sorry if you think my moral principle of not taking value/money from people who have staked ICP to fund your foundations is an issue.  That‚Äôs pretty telling actually.

I‚Äôm still waiting for you to make a specific argument about why you can‚Äôt raise funds to support the growth you want for the IC and why you need the NNS to fund it.

You are trying to change the status quo not me‚Ä¶the burden of proof is on you to convince us why 1) we need a treasury and 2) how we are going to fund it.

So does this imply that DFINITY only has issues with agendas being pushed via the NNS if they affect network performance?
[/quote]

Good question @Accumulating.icp . Clearly if my original statement leads to this question, I did not write it very clearly.

What I tried to say (a bit clumsily!) is that the proposals are judged for what they do, both costs and benefits. But concrete ones. 

You used the word ‚Äúagenda‚Äù but we don‚Äôt look at agendas, we look at what the concrete outcomes, as well as options created and options reduced (there are many design decisions we have taken or not taken because it reduced potential doors we want to keep open).

If someone submits a proposal that makes NNS awesome and Tokenomics but their agenda is ‚ÄúI want to make money to support a political party in Mexico‚Äù, I personally don‚Äôt think we should care as a community. 

Inversely, if a proposal fixed X problem but it led to more inflation or slower NNS or hurt a portion of the IC ecosystem or whatever, I may think the costs is too high for the solution it solves.

ZCash is a good example of funding public goods organizations. 20% of mining rewards go to 3 organizations to further develop the protocol.

ZCash token holders are not worried about theft and runaway inflation. They are grateful there are experts who can further the development of their coin in a sustainable way. Money to fund public goods has to come from somewhere. I am totally unconvinced by the theft and runaway inflation argument.

Umm when you change the rules and take rewards that would‚Äôve gone to voters‚Ä¶aka take something that‚Äôs not yours‚Ä¶what do you call it?!

Also, if the miners aka node providers want to put a % of their node rewards into a treasury then that‚Äôs up to them.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-10-28 16:45:06 UTC | #182

Still unconvinced.

Rewards would not have gone to voters. It‚Äôs a small amount of inflation to the monetary supply that‚Äôs subject to a cap.

You are also confusing the mechanism of how the 3 ZCash foundations receive funding. The amount is determined based on a percentage of mining rewards. It‚Äôs not reducing the mining rewards by 20%. One could equally say the IC should fund its treasury by providing additional inflation as a percentage of what node providers are currently being paid. It‚Äôs over and above. Not a reduction.

All the arguments against the treasury thus far are mired in emotion, scaremongering and appeals to vague principles and false accusations of theft. Please convince me otherwise! I promise I‚Äôm open to changing my opinion if it‚Äôs convincing

This is crypto. We‚Äôre here because of a lack of transparency in authority & the need for decentralization. ‚ÄúTrust me, I have good intentions, your just scared for no reason‚Äù is not good enough. 

I am not opposed to a treasury, but I‚Äôm opposed to the idea of 

1. The treasury being controlled by named neurons in their current state. They are extremely centralized, with 2 named neurons casting 66% of voting power.

2. The treasury coming at the expense of stakers rewards.

[/quote]

These are fair concerns.  I‚Äôd like to better understand how you have come to these conclusions though.  

Why do you think the treasury would be controlled by 2 named neurons?  The mechanisms of how it would be controlled have not been proposed by anyone as far as I know,  It certainly would not be governance motion proposals because those proposal types are not capable of executing any type of code.  At this time, I don‚Äôt know how it would be controlled.  My hope previously was that we would be able to come up with some good ideas on how it would be controlled through a working group, which would include DFINITY since they would have to develop and implement code changes, as well as anyone in the community who wanted to contribute to the conversation.  Hence, I don‚Äôt understand how it is assumed that 2 named neurons would even be capable of controlling a treasury.  That‚Äôs just not how the NNS works.

When it comes to Governance Motion proposals, do you have any idea on how to rebalance liquid democracy such that 2 neurons don‚Äôt cast 66% of voting power?

I‚Äôd like to point out again that we don‚Äôt have staker rewards.  We have governance rewards.  Any staker who votes has always received their rewards and will always receive their rewards.  I honestly wish it were possible to motivate all stakers to participate in governance (voting) so everyone receives their voting rewards AND we achieve decentralization.  I would love for the difference between staking participation and a voter participation to be negligible so there is no debate on who is owed governance rewards.

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-28 17:59:52 UTC | #188

A. Just because you don‚Äôt publicly acknowledge this scenario could happen, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt. Look how centralized voting power is - and how DFINITY very clearly colluded with ICDevs to create the ‚Äúspam proposal‚Äù (which has been confirmed both publicly & privately). We can act like it will never happen, and I truly hope it doesn‚Äôt, but this is crypto. I‚Äôm not supposed to have to trust you. 

B. I agree on B. But this more so comes down to how engaged the NNS is. The only people who knew about this, were those who actively vote & scour the forums. That is not the typical staker - they tend to be inactive - as demonstrated by the followee metric. So while the proposers of this may have spoken about it on the forum for a week - the amount of people that view the forum is microscopic in comparison to the amount of neurons there are. So was this actually a valid temperature check of the community? Should DFINITY have voted on it, given how close the results were, and torn the active community is?

C. In regards to spam proposals, I follow the NNS extremely closely. I noticed a difference in spam proposals when the weighting was changed - long before this spam proposal was proposed. So it‚Äôs purpose was to stop something that already ceased to exist. 

D. Referring you back to B. Did the community get to form an opinion on these biases, or was the forum discussion an echo chamber of the same members repeating things, until the opposition was drowned out (similar  to what some have observed happening here).

E. Should there not be a moral compass involved in how people vote within the NNS? Doesn‚Äôt it seem shortsighted to vote on a proposal, without considering what could be built off of a proposal?

My point is in that in any design system you have to be aware of what opportunities you are opening yourself upto and which you are closing.

We at Dfinity did not think the spam proposal would ‚Äúpaint us into a corner‚Äù where we would be forced to accept or vote in any one direction in some future proposal. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm referring to.

My comment has nothing about the trust less ethos of crypto‚Ä¶ and more with the design philosophy of computer science. If we thought the spam proposal would mean (for example), now all dapps would have to be written in Rust (closing door on Js, Motoko, Python, etc‚Ä¶) that would be an example of painting ourselves into a corner. We did not think it did. Does my comment about ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù and ‚Äúcheckmating‚Äù into a corner make more sense? I don‚Äôt discount vague writing on my part.

I have an educated and uneducated opinion on this:

1. Educated opinion - I believe while spam has decreased, I also believed the incentive for spam remained‚Ä¶ meaning we had solved nothing and it will come back again. Like an open window in a store after hours‚Ä¶. We still needed to close the window even if people stopped robbing it. 

2. Uneducated opinion - I suspect (based on anecdotal evidence) that spam proposal had decreased just as you write .

This has to be the strangest "collusion" in history.

First of all...I'm the executive director of ICDevs, but on the forums here I'm just acting as me unless I specifically state otherwise. Secondly ICDev's participation in governance is generally controlled by our Developer Advisory board and by committee, I generally make a recommendation, but there is regularly pushback from that board and ICDevs has voted against my recommendation both when I agreed with it and when they changed my mind.

Secondly, DFINITY said no to this proposal previously and then addressed me personally as the author as a courtesy to ask if I wanted to re-raise it.  If I had said NO they would have just done it themselves.

Thirdly, in reference to there not being a need because the weights had fixed spam: 1. ysyms was threatening to start again if it wasn't fixed and 2. The ending of exchange rate proposals was going to cause spam to become a problem again, especially on weekends when regular proposals were going to stop.

Fourthly, I posted the proposal in a public forum, waited a week for debate, crowdfunded the proposal fee and then asked the ICDevs dev board how they wanted to vote and executed the vote.

Absolutely nothing will get done in this space if we can't work with each other without the personal attack of 'collusion' being thrown around every time someone tries to effect change.

dfisher | 2022-10-28 19:13:33 UTC | #200

Let me try again. I would like to shift the conversation so you can understand my point of view, even if you ultimately disagree with it. I think with understanding comes mutual respect. Talking about implementation details is missing the wood from the trees.

Where would the IC be today if Dfinity suddenly ceased to exist? I personally believe we would be in big trouble. No one would be able to upgrade the replica and make improvements to the protocol. Currently only Dfinity has the expertise and resources to hire world class cryptographers.

Now imagine that there were many organizations that existed like Dfinity. Organizations with resources that were devoted to hiring the best and brightest globally to build on the amazing foundations we have. They would do work equivalent to building roads and infrastructure. Today we need government to build those things since we have a tragedy of the commons problem. Private enterprise is not incentivized to build roads and traffic lights - we need government to build them. They are public goods.

Now how do we pay for it? Clearly, people are not being honest if they say they believe all inflation is stealing. That‚Äôs because we already have inflation to pay node providers. No one thinks node providers are stealing from IC token holders. We wouldn‚Äôt be here today if node providers weren‚Äôt allowing us to store our data on their servers. Ok, so we agree that some types of inflation are not stealing, they are necessary to provide a public good. So here the question is if we provide inflation to node providers, does it make sense to consider creating inflation to pay for multiple organizations like Dfinity to ensure our protocol keeps evolving?

Now, notice I‚Äôm not saying the answer is a hard yes. I‚Äôm merely asking the question and pointing out other projects like ZCash have gone down this path. I do think it‚Äôs in our best interest to open our minds and ask ourselves - how has the ZCash experiment with development funding from inflation gone? Is it going well or is it failing? Is it causing a devaluation in the ZCash token or is it ultimately to everyone‚Äôs benefit? I actually don‚Äôt know the answer and would love to find out.

These are the kinds of questions we would seek to answer in a working group. The Internet Computer is the most advanced and complicated blockchain in existence and I think we owe it to the future of its development to take these questions seriously.

Thanks for clarifying what you meant by that. From that POV, yes, I can see how DFINITY stands where they do on this one. 

I‚Äôm sure you can tell by your second paragraph - that is mostly where my concern comes from. The trustless ethos that is known to crypto - and the scary potential of it being stripped from our ecosystem, one proposal at a time. 

Not insinuating this is actively happening, but nonetheless, it is my concern.

That‚Äôs a fair reason to vote in agreeance with the proposal, however when that isn‚Äôt voiced - it seems as though that DFINITY simply agrees with the proposal.

The point to be made was that there was clearly a coordinated effort by the two parties to work together on this (who also control an extremely large VP%).

Yes, there was collaboration on spam proposal (and many others proposals!) between multiple entities who represent large voting power. Most of that voting power comes from following. If people do not like how their following-based voting power is being used, folks can remove it.

**Is this not the system working as it should?**

I Can speak on behalf of  Dfinity that it was a mistake of us to NOT explain more clearly how we interpreted the proposal, and what vote meant and did not mean.

**I know I said it at the top comment in the forum post, but it bears repeating: we intend to do better here. That was a mistake.**
