I’m sure you can tell by your second paragraph - that is mostly where my concern comes from. The trustless ethos that is known to crypto - and the scary potential of it being stripped from our ecosystem, one proposal at a time.

Not insinuating this is actively happening, but nonetheless, it is my concern

I think this is all very reasonable and I share that same thinking. It’s why I applaud the folks who call things out and keep us all honest.

From my POV you are doing a good thing @Accumulating.icp . You should always ask about what doesn’t look right to you.

if we provide inflation to node providers, does it make sense to consider creating inflation to pay for multiple organizations like Dfinity to ensure our protocol keeps evolving?
[/quote]

I think this analogy isn't really accurate. Rewarding node providers, and voters, is not the same as also creating an NNS treasury to be used to fund public goods through a voting mechanism used to allocate funds. The first two are much less risky to the stability of the entire IC and are different for many other reasons. 

If proponents of the NNS treasury believe that funding for public goods is needed, I think they would recognize that NNS treasury isn't the only way to fund public goods, and there are less risky alternative approaches which i've mentioned in prior posts (sns, ethereum uses gitcoin types of funding mechanism to raise succesfuly hundreds of millions, and many other "voluntary contribution methods") that would potentially lead to more optimal resource allocation than an NNS treasury. 

Perhaps the default approach should be to try these low risk funding routes to see if they are viable options, prior to embarking on the high risk endeavor of NNS treasury and only if they fail and prove to be untenable, then seeking other alternatives. Ideally, a combination of these voluntary funding mechanisms would render the need for a nns treasury as moot, as it would satisfy the original intent behind creating the treasury without the associated risk.

I think this is very sensible.  In fact, it’s been stated multiple times that “NNS treasury” may have been the wrong label to use and that there may be better options.  I also think that everyone who supports the treasury idea has also stated on multiple occasions that starting small is the best path forward.  These are all ideas that were intended to be fleshed out in a working group by anyone who wanted to participate.

I suppose it’s not so much a direct question, but rather a statement. I’m not suggesting that you, Synapse, or ICDevs really could have done much differently. I’m merely stating that the way our governance is setup, is to enable the passive staker. Meaning the grand majority of the community, delegates their voting power to someone else. Leaving the forums extremely barren of actual community consensus, but rather bomboarded solely the opinions of those who make the decision - not those it affects. 

So if anything, I suppose I am suggesting this was not a true community temperature check.

I’d agree that this specific conversation has not been an echo chamber, but rather, pretty productive. I’m just stating that the forums do tend to become an echo chamber of the previously stated party.

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-28 21:49:21 UTC | #211

Again, I suppose collaboration is a better word than collusion. And sorry, I was under the impression you represented ICDevs. Going forward, I’ll simply refer to you directly. 

While “Collusion” was the wrong word, nonetheless, this proposal was propagated in the dark by DFINITY & Afat. I was unaware that it had originally been rejected by DFINITY, but I was informed that DFINITY had reached out & specifically asked for this proposal to be created. 

I respect the public discussion, but I’m sure you can see where the distrust comes from. It’s not a good look when someone who represents 6% of Voting Power , works in private with DFINITY, to push a proposal, that now directly enables another proposal that could fund them (as discussed in townhalls). 

It’s not meant to be an attack, but merely an adjective - just trying to describe the situation as I see it.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-28 20:41:52 UTC | #212

I’d argue that the issue isn’t the inability to un-delegate voting power, but rather the fact that we’ve set a “set & forget” precedent, during a time with 3? Named Neurons. This has caused a disproportionate allocation of voting power, not because people feel as though the neurons represent their best interest, but because there were only 2 options available that ensured you’d receive maximum rewards passively.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-28 20:59:21 UTC | #213

Hello Wenzel.

In regards to how two names neurons can achieve 66% of voting power;
- When DFINITY Votes, they cast ~100m votes
- When Synapse Votes, they cast ~40m votes
- There is ~220m active voting power in topics that are not completely delegated to DFINITY

100m/220m= ~45%
40m/220m= ~18%

Which equates to ~63%, sorry, seems I was a bit off. 

How do I come to the conclusion that Named Neurons will be in control of the entity? It’s simple. You want to do it through the NNS. How do we control the NNS? Named Neurons. 

“Do you have any such idea as to how to balance liquid democracy??” (I hope this wasn’t meant to be an insult Wenzel, especially with all these “attacking” accusations)

It’s quite simple. Periodic Followee Resets, on a quarterly to semi-annual basis, to ensure that those who wish to passive stake, have to periodically confirm the named neurons they’re following. This ensures that the follower, is regularly confirming the followee still represents their best interests.

5) I’m not against a treasury…
6) I am against funding it from the NNS
7) we don’t need roads, water, electric, infrastructure with a blockchain…but also those have use cases that people pay for 
8) make the case of what needs to be built and raise funding 
9) if you want to take a % of platform revenues (ICP burn) to fund its existence that is a different story than hitting people who have locked their funds for 8 years … but we can’t manufacture value by extracting it from the network…in order to increase value you have to attract value into the network…

The NNS was, when I invested, created with fairness for all, in my opinion and I loved that I could follow and be rewarded by giving someone else my vote.

To be honest I had no idea about the DFINITY forum till I did some research and became a member to be a part of the discussions.

The one question I have right now after being a member for some time is about the comments that those who participate in voting deserve more rewards but when I go onto the NNS to vote I don’t see much else than network upgrades, renaming neurons, spam and nothing that I need to understand.

I don’t see where these Active neuron holders deserve more rewards by taking away from other neuron holders, please give me one example!

I also would like to hear from those who don’t vote or as they say are inactive as there are many assumptions about why you don’t participate, I would like to hear your side of the story or maybe you are unaware that this forum exists as there is no information on the NNS on how to be active or is this deliberate.

As far as spam goes, if you want to create a proposal on the NNS you should have a 1000 icp on your neuron and add a spam button with the except or reject buttons, if you are spamming then your neuron is burned, simple no spam but no we have to have bells, whistles and handles without success.

None I have seen anyways, same old subjects but now we have a new idea about how to take rewards from others, just missing a sink because the treasury already has the neuron holders to take rewards from.

@dfisher I definitely sympathize with your decentralization motives here. However, creating more DFinity organizations will not solve the more fundamental problem of how to implement collective prioritization. If there were 10 Definity organizations deciding upon the future of the IC, it would create almost as much unresolvable conflict as making all neurons collectively responsible for the significant number of prioritizations and resource allocation tradeoffs to make during this journey. As I emphasized before, the NNS currently can't handle prioritizations such as timing and resource allocation conflicts, which form the bulk of the most important decisions in all organizations. Approval voting simply isn't fit for the purpose of prioritization, nor will it ever be.

The only solution that I see is implementing some sort of collective prioritization process within DFinity, just like I have suggested for the NNS itself. The general public will eventually need some assurance that DFinity is operated as a resilient, permissionless DAO. That means developing and implementing a collective prioritization processes to ensure that all power has been sufficiently decentralized on all major prioritization decisions (i.e., excluding low level task decisions that have no significant budgetary or timing impact). Reaching this point could be a few years away even if we start right now, so I strongly suggest that we start soon. 

The Internet Computer won't be perceived as a beta project for much longer. As the stakes become higher and more real, the cracks in the decentralization narrative will become exponentially more obvious and repugnant to those who depend on the IC to sustain their livelihoods and ecosystems.

In the meantime, we just have to accept the following: 1) DFinity is a single point of failure in this visionary project, which (if unchanged) will increasingly endanger its fundamental mission to oppose both centralized power and censorship; and 2) DFinity is essentially run under a traditional dictatorship model, like every organization on the planet today that is too large for deliberative democracy and other consensus reaching processes. 

From my perspective, I am quite OK with this concentrated risk and dictatorial power during the startup phase. It could even add to both innovation agility and the prospects of success given the trust that I currently have for the DFinity team and its vision. However, in the longer term, I think we all agree that we should never have to rely on trust, and we most certainly can't rely on any dictatorship remaining benevolent or censorship-free when the economic and societal stakes for the IC grow exponentially higher. That is why I have been so emphatic about initiating some sort of collective effort to cross the "prioritization chasm". This is the only way the decentralization vision can become a genuine reality -- in bulletproof fashion -- instead of just being an illusion of decentralized power that we have today.

As for the treasury fund, there really is no point in even voting on this, let alone on an actual implementation proposal, until we have a collective prioritization process in place that could fairly allocate these scarce resources in the most optimal fashion.

I don’t disagree with this.

The following model has advantage of allowing people to come to quick consensus (there is a reason that there have been hundreds of updates to the IC, while only a handful in ETH during the same time).

But it also has the consequence you described.

Could we design something to do better?

I’m optimistically we can all soften the costs or even remove it. I admit I’m not sure what that looks like, but that’s why i support open design processes.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-10-28 22:00:39 UTC | #221

I don’t think the Followee model needs to be scrapped necessarily (this is where I’ll disclaim my bias; I vote for the Accumulators Neuron & TFC), but I do think it needs some updates. For example, the Periodic Followee Reset proposal passed 6+ months ago, and still has not been implemented. This doesn’t completely fix the issue, but it ensures as a passive follower, you’re forced to re-delegate your voting power every 6 months (I think quarterly could be better, similar to a company showing earnings, but potentially more tedious) if you want to keep receiving rewards. Again, this doesn’t completely solve it, as they could continuously just set&forget the same neuron - but atleast neuron owners are forced to look into where they’ve assigned their voting power  frequently, which hopefully inspires research. @diegop


EDIT: I think it could also be beneficial to have a timer within the neuron tab, disclaiming when the next followee reset is.

I agree that we control the NNS through neuron voting and I agree that 2 named neurons trigger 66% of total voting power that is cast on Governance Motion proposals.  However, Governance Motion proposals do not control code.  They are opinion polls that have huge psychological impact, but zero control over the internet computer.  There is no proposal topic that exists today to control a treasury through the NNS.  Hence, it would have to be created and would not fall under Governance.  In fact, if it were placed under All Topics, then DFINITY would have 100% control due to default following.  That is also not likely to happen because the point is decentralization.  Hence, the mechanics of how a treasury would be controlled by the NNS would definitely need to be worked out and have not been defined in any way so far.  It most certainly will not be controlled by 2 named neurons.

This is very true, but not only do they have a large psychological impact - more often than not, governance proposals are asking for permission / proposing to implement code. Which is then acted upon. However, upon review of the NNS Followee system - I agree with you. I see there are a few topics other than “Governance” under the “All Except….” category, and I assume the NNS Treasury, if ever implemented, would be one of them, similar to the SNS & CF. Meaning current Followees would not apply to the topic - forcing a reset of followee regardless.

I think this is correct.  This is why I think it is incorrect to say that a few neurons would control decisions on a treasury.  IF (a big if) a treasury were ever built into the NNS, it would be intentionally designed for much more decentralized decision making.  I don’t think it would look anything like governance motion proposals.

This is how I used to think it was supposed to work, but it hasn’t worked this way.  It is a core reason why I have concluded that a treasury is needed.  I want to attract people and organizations that can become contributors to the IC.  There is not a single community lead governance motion proposal that has ever been implemented after it passed an NNS vote.  So far the only governance motion proposals that have been implemented are proposals created by DFINITY.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-10-29 04:55:36 UTC | #232

@diegop and @wpb , your fruitful exchange has exposed a great anecdotal example of 1) how approval (at the NNS level) and prioritization (done only at the DFinity level) are two very different things, and 2) which role ultimately rules as the overriding power. Again, I'm not criticizing DFinity here, since I don't think any bad intentions were involved. It is just a reflection of the universal reality that control over resource allocations / priorities is the essence of what power is, and what gets done when.

Incorporating collective prioritizations into the strategic decision-making process of a large organization is far more difficult than most people imagine it should be. It requires a fundamental surrender of real power to a collective entity, with terrifying uncertainty about what will happen next. Only when we can collectively see and realize how difficult it is can we rise to the challenge of addressing it as a universal human problem. Unfortunately, this realization also tends to require a challenge to our most cherished illusions about political "Democracy" and "Freedom" (the capitalized ideology versions), which most of us have been inculcated since childhood to hold so dear. 

Even more daunting, I know of no large organization that has ever truly succeeded in this challenge. Nevertheless, that will not stop me from dedicating the next few years of my life to a PhD to give it my best shot. My hope is that others in the Internet Computer ecosystem will want to help, in at least a minor way, to give it a shot as well. Never forget that, just a few years ago, no one had ever succeeded in building the dream of a "World Computer", which was mocked as an unreachable fantasy. Yet here we are, talking about how to take that "fantasy" to the next level in our reality.

I can think of a few, including this, right where Dfinity is headquartered:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migros

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-10-29 18:03:41 UTC | #234

@tsetse, cooperatives like Migros are a great first step in allowing workers and customers to be owners of a business. However, even in these situations, a trusted leader (i.e., benevolent dictator) is still relied upon to make the key prioritization decisions. There is nothing in this link that demonstrates any collective prioritization process exists. 

Nonprofits and unions are the same, all relying on a trusted surrender of power to a benevolent dictator, which therefore remains as a single point of failure for potential corruption. Even if goal congruence is assumed between the cooperative owners and the trusted dictator (which further assumes that the dictator can somehow know what the owners' varied priorities are as a collective entity), this obviously introduces a single point of coercive control by a government or other centralized power. That would obviously be disastrous in the long run for the Internet Computer in an age of escalating censorship pressure and privacy invasion. 

Incidentally, this single point of failure logic is the same reason why the U.S. has actively supported so many dictatorships and ironically overthrown so many governments that have popular or democratic support when they refuse to obey U.S. resource allocation directives: one grifting dictator is very easy to control and manipulate, but the collective will of an entire country is not. Likewise, anyone who still believes that wars are altruistically initiated for the "Freedom & Democracy"® of poor and oppressed foreigners instead of selfish control over resources is not really living in the real world.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-30 05:39:15 UTC | #235

If one defines collective prioritisation as every member having an equal input in decisions, and anything short of that meaning a benevolent dictatorship and a single point of failure, I think this is a false dichotomy and not just an unrealistic goal as has been stated, but also an undesirable one. As far as Migros goes, the collective engages in important decisions, but leaves the day to day running to executives all of whom, unlike dictators, are easily replaceable.
As for wars, I do not think they are altruistically initiated, but also do not think they are all about resource control, another false dichotomy. 
Anyway, the Migros example was not about a perfect co-operative, because perfection does not exist, more about what has been achieved in the brick and mortar world without some of the benefits of technology we now possess. Hopefully, we can eventually do even better.

No, @tsetse, equal input in all decisions is not my definition of collective prioritization. That would be a strawman fallacy.

Hi Diego,

Quick question:  do you acknowledge that today we don’t actually have a spam problem that needs solving?

After resetting the weighting it disappeared.

Also, within the spam proposal it’s now proposed to return the weighting to 20 which as far as I can tell will only maximize the amount abandoned or undistributed ICP.

I’m really curious what’s the point of all this if not to create a big pile of ICP to use for a treasury?

It doesn’t exist…show me how many spam proposals there has been since the weighting was reverted.

Also, I asked @diegop not you.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-31 13:49:38 UTC | #243

I'll let Diego give an official response, but I'll relay what I was told.

Source: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/29

When the weights went back to one there was still a small incentive to spam because there are a lot of exchange rate proposals and those have a .01(x144 per day....so you start with a total weight of 1.4 for all DFINITY followers on Exchange Rate) weight.  So there was still an imbalance with the weights at 1 for all others.  If one had issued a bunch of spams every day you could have eventually gotten to where there would have been an advantage.

The problem was about to get worse though because the exchange rate proposals are going away.  So all of that weighting that was counterbalancing spams is going to go away.  There was especially going to be a problem on weekends when there were going to be none of the standard subnet and upgrade proposals that usually balance out the weightings.

After resetting the weighting it disappeared.

Why do you assume the spam proposal creates a big pile of ICP? It does NOT.

It actually **decreases** the amount of maturity created.

skilesare | 2022-10-31 14:07:15 UTC | #246

In visual form we are moving from the scenario on the left to the scenario on the right, especially on weekends.  So 2/7 of the days of the year it was going to be really easy for spammers to take 100% of the voting reward away from more passive voters.  Currently we see less spam because you have to post a bunch of spam to chip away at that 1.4 weighing. When the weight was at 20 spammers had to produce 20x less spam to achieve the same effect.

![image|690x482](upload://d4UKxlEnK1mf9B02YCXIVDSS6cC.png)

You can keep saying there was 'no reason' for the spam prevention proposal, but you are just wrong.  

There was a reason for it and it reduces the incentive of a serious upcoming problem.  It did not completely remove the incentive but it did shift if from spam directly increasing your maturity to much harder-to-divine reduction in inflation.

I was hoping that the second spam prevention proposal that created a 1% accept threshold would even reduce this incentive further by making it much harder to one's spam proposal to actually count, but it was voted down.  I think after the SNS stuff comes out we'll see some more robust proposals for two-stage proposals that accomplish this more completely.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 14:11:35 UTC | #247

I haven't seen a spam proposal in weeks?  months?  We've seen some malicious proposals for named neurons which this still wouldn't stop.

It seems odd that we are trying to solve a problem that we aren't even sure still exists and to what degree.

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 14:14:45 UTC | #248

What is abandoned ICP and undistributed ICP?  Will Dfinity agree to not track something that doesn't exist?

Because if it exists and is measurable it is either 1) voters rewards or 2) non-voters rewards, right?

Diego, let's also remember it has been suggested several several several times that this ICP that does not exist could be used to fund the treasury!  I'm not that smart but I'm not sure how you can fund a treasury with something that doesn't exist...

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 14:20:10 UTC | #249

My primary issue is not the spam although I'd don't see any data ie how many spam proposals since weighting was reverted.

My primary issue is the fact that you @wpb and @dfisher have suggested funding a treasury with something that was created by the spam proposal (ie abandoned/undistributed ICP) which @diegop has now said doesn't exist...

So are guys trying to fund a treasury with something that doesn't exist or does it exist?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-31 14:21:03 UTC | #250

Did you read @bjoernek's post?  The weekend spam incentive is about to 4x.  I mean...there is math, statistics, and everything.  Sure we could have just waited until we had a bunch of spam, but why not head it off at the pass?

You have plenty of standing to express your concerns that inflation is not the right way to fund a treasury...I'm not sure why you're clinging so hard to this. It is ok to be wrong about there not being a reason for the spam prevention proposal. You didn't see DFINITY's explanation until now.  It doesn't subvert your opinion and desire to not use inflation for a treasury.  

I was wrong to to pick the words 'abandoned ICP' I could have picked a much more appropriate word....I should have just called it unminted ICP. See super easy to admit when you are wrong about something.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 14:32:36 UTC | #251

But there is currently no spam...so we are speculating but ok...seems like we created another problem that we need to solve even if it doesn't exist yet.

You (conveniently) skipped over one important part though...the abandoned/undistributed/unmited ICP that definitely doesn't exist per @diegop ... how can you fund a treasury with something that doesn't exist?!

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-31 14:36:49 UTC | #252

You can see in the code here : https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/governance/src/reward.rs

```
// Explication for the implementation of
// `rewards_pool_to_distribute_in_supply_fraction`
//
// The relevant extract from the spec is:
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// We derive the nominal maximum quantity of ICP that can be
// minted and distributed as rewards from the current ICP supply and
// the days since Genesis. To begin with, this is equal to 10% of the
// ICP supply divided by the number of days in the year (365 normally,
// 366 in a leap year). Over 8 years, this falls to 5%. Note that since
// the supply of ICP might grow (or even in theory fall) during this time,
// voting rewards may not halve in practice.
//
// * We want the rate at genesis to be 10% per year
// * We want the rate at genesis + 8 years to be 5% per year, and to be flat
//   thereafter
// * We want the rate to be a quadratic function of time
// * We want the rate to be differentiable wrt time at the point where it
//   becomes flat
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Calling R0 the initial rate at genesis time G, Rf the final rate, and T the
// time at which the rate becomes flat, the unique solution is:
//
// R(t) = Rf + (R0-Rf) [ (t-T) / (G-T) ]^2
//
// Note that:
// R(G) = Rf + (R0-Rf) [ (G- T) / (G-T) ] ^ 2 = Rf + (R0-Rf) = R0
// R(T) = Rf + (R0-Rf) [ (T- T) / (G-T) ] ^ 2 = Rf
// R'(t) = 2 (R0-Rf)  (t-T) / ( G-T )^2
// R'(T) = 0
//
```

There is clear intention here to establish an amount to grow the supply based on the total supply each day.  This formula exists. It produces a real number of minted maturity each day. Now I 100% get in retrospect that a bunch of people feel that if we don't give it as a reward we shouldn't mint it at all, but given this extensive mathematical calculation, that one can certainly make an assumption that DFINITY thought through it clearly and had a good reason to mint at least that much Maturity a day.

If it is well thought though, and there was a reason, and now we're not going to hit that number now, it just doesn't have to take much imagination to think that some people would try to find solutions for that number to keep being hit in a productive way.  You are wholly within your rights to vehemently disagree with the methodology chosen and propose a different one(including that it wasn't thought through and it is ultimately much more advantageous to let the number decline with reduced inflation).  But to express the amount of disbelief that continues to be thrown around just doesn't make sense to me.

This was not an inappropriate thing to propose given the assumption whatsoever.  The continued tone that it was is just not helpful. There are plenty of ways to justify different, better approaches that are much more constructive.  Prove the assumptions are wrong or misguided and stop poking the people who made them.  Nobody brings all the right assumptions to the table every time.  That is why we want diversification of thought and approach.  We can all make each other better if we work together.

`How Would Such a Treasury Get Funded?`

There are three options to fund such a treasury:

1. Increase inflation of all neurons
2. Reduce staking rewards from all neurons while keeping inflation constant
3. Reduce the staking rewards from only non-voting neurons (or another group of neurons)

The benefit of the third option, as proposed from @Kyle_Langham, is that this funding mechanism does not penalize voters who are engaged in governance. As such, it aligns incentives to get neurons to properly participate.
[/quote]

What I'm trying to get people to understand is that these guys are trying to create a treasury but in order to do it they needed to create abandoned/undistributed/unminted ICP.  

So let's be clear about abandoned ICP...it was inflation rewards that went to voters now that this is reduced it creates the gap between planned inflation that they will/are trying to use to create a treasury.  These are their words not mine.

*" **Hanlon's razor** is an adage or rule of thumb that states "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity." Known in several other forms, it is a philosophical razor that suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for human behavior.*

I'm not implying that they or I am stupid, but we certainly have ignorance.  I don't remember if exchange rate proposals were weighted at Genesis at .01 or not, but that simple addition to tokenomics created spam incentive.  I'm like 98% convinced that you can either have equal weighting across all topics or a voter based system, but if you don't pick one of those two you are letting spam incentives in.

Do I think @wpb was laying the groundwork for an inflation-based treasury by promoting the increase of rewards to weight 20?  Come on.  Did I found a non-profit that requires a stupid amount of IRS paperwork so I could not pay myself a salary in September '21 and then build a voter-based reward system into Origyn in November '21 so I could suggest it for the IC in May '22 and then conspire with DFINITY to bring it back up in September '22 in an effort to extract value out of the IC in October of '22? Yeah....sure...I pulled all that together...and we almost had it... if only it hadn't been for you meddling kids. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXUqwuzcGeU /s (Sorry for the attempt at levity....but I've got to laugh at something these days.)

Yep...you nailed it. And almost universally, in every conversation I've had where this was proposed, cooler heads have said..."hey...that seems like it could be misused...it could be useful...but we really need to think about it first".  If you were looking to raise an alarm about an idea you thought was bad, you have 100% succeeded...like I just don't get why you're still intent on the accusation that this was all a big conspiracy. A simple, no-oversight, value-extracting treasury funded by inflation is pretty much off the table(I don't think it ever was being proposed at the extremes that seem to be implied....but if it was...you all have done a great job keeping it from moving forward like that).

To be helpful, I will first quote what I said above and then dive deeper @mechaquan :

[quote="diegop, post:193, topic:16156"]
I have an educated and uneducated opinion on this:

1. Educated opinion - I believe while spam has decreased, I also believed the incentive for spam remained… meaning we had solved nothing and it will come back again. Like an open window in a store after hours…. We still needed to close the window even if people stopped robbing it.

2. Uneducated opinion - I suspect (based on anecdotal evidence) that spam proposal had decreased just as you write .
[/quote]

in any protocol, there are many attacks or issues have that decrease or have NOT happened, but should be measured and addressed.

As I said above, the tokenomics incentive for spam still remains. That hole is still there. That is why we voted to adopt a design that would address the incentive. That is not odd at all. There are many proposals and implementations that solve or address issues that have yet to happen or (seemingl) stopped happening.

Using a hypothetical: if the IC were DDOS'd on due to a security issue, it would be very reasonable to spend time to fix the issue even if the DDOS happened only once. 

We at DFINITY see it the same way: t**he incentive for spam is STILL there, irregardless of how many actors use it. Some argue, the removal of the exchange rate proposal, only helps further incentivize spam.** 

For context, the incentive for spam was ALSO there before the actors realized it and started spamming. I think it's reasonable to also deprioritize spam before the issue shows up. Once spam showed up, I think the calculus changed.

Does this make sense @mechaquan ?

Well, we have multiple things going on:

1. "abandoned ICP" or "Unallocated ICP" or whatever name they call it was meant to be a metric to record in the NNS the difference between actual and potential rewards. Notably, this only helps to show how much ICP was NOT created. 
Also notably, it would be very possible (thought not as clean) to calculate the amount of ICP not created on any given day (A spreadsheet can do that). So people will still be able to figure out how much ICP was NOT created due to the spam proposal.

> Will Dfinity agree to not track something that doesn’t exist?

If people feel really strongly about it, I can talk to people at DFINITY about withdrawing support for it, **but it's important to note what it is and what is not. It is NOT some dark pool or slush fund of ICP. People on socials said this, but it is not.**

> Because if it exists and is measurable it is either 1) voters rewards or 2) non-voters rewards, right?

But it does NOT exist, so rest does not matter.

> Diego, let’s also remember it has been suggested several several several times that this ICP that does not exist could be used to fund the treasury! I’m not that smart but I’m not sure how you can fund a treasury with something that doesn’t exist…

This is also a misunderstanding.

The unallocated ICP does NOT exist.

What some people in the forums are arguing is this (in simplistic terms):

1. Before spam proposal, there will be (example fake number) 100K ICP rewards given per day.

2. Once spam proposal is adopted, there may be (example fake number) only 75k ICP rewards given per day.

3. The IC should further decentralize all its activities and use tokenomics to fulfill activities, so IC is reliant on more entities. Same way node providers are paid for their work. Could Developers, marketers, etc... be paid for their work? This is not a unique idea in Web3.

4. Since there Spam proposal **reduces** the amount of rewards, some argue that creating ICP for decentralizing work can happen WITHOUT adding any ICP inflation to the **known schedule** (which goes from 10% per year to 5% per year).

Now, you may...

a. **Agree** with the idea of decentralizing work, but think that the NNS and voting is too immature for this. Maybe there some problems people see that need to be addressed first.

b. **Agree** with the idea of decentralizing work, but think that the inflation costs are too high. Maybe there is some inflation cost that is more reasonable.

c. **Agree** with the idea of decentralizing work, but not like the funding sources (MANY funding sources have been proposed from donations to minting to giving locked 8 year neurons).

d. **Disagree** with the idea of decentralizing work in the first place because you think it will not work as intended.

e. **Disagree** with the idea of decentralizing work in the first place because you disagree on more philosophical reasons that no practical change can really address.

f. **Be Open to the idea** if decentralized work, but think it is too risky or doubt the certainty of the arguments.

All these are very valid ideas. I think they should be open discussed and evaluated in the marketplace of ideas.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 17:33:33 UTC | #259

Ok I think maybe I wasn’t direct enough so let me try again…

1) does this actually stop spam?  The financial incentive to spam, maybe, but you can still market via a motion proposal to the IC voters for a mere 10 ICP!
2) I would also argue that the spam incentive is still there to pump a “treasury” fund with rewards from non-voters…otherwise what value does a weighting of 20 for gov proposals have if my maximum rewards are capped if I vote on everything?!
3) is spam really equivalent to a security risk?!  Again, this doesn’t stop someone creating a proposal with morally unacceptable material, right?!
4) bottomline my point regarding the lack of spam and if this is really a problem that needs to be solved is more about how it doesn’t actually stop spam and seems more like it’s to create a funding vehicle for a treasury by creating abandoned/undistributed/unminted ICP.

If that’s the intent let’s just be transparent about that!

I have two fundamental issues: 1) we made a very centralized decision to reduce voters rewards without being transparent about that but rather under the guise of spam prevention (which as mentioned in my previous post…I don’t think it actually achieves) and 2) I don’t think the NNS should be funding projects or foundations and especially not something as subjective as marketing.

I’d like to see a very detailed list and roadmap of what these projects are planning to do…very similar to what Dfinity had to do to get their funding…that seems fair to ask for before any treasury/funding conversations, right?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-31 18:58:16 UTC | #261

Very fair questions @mechaquan , I can answer those I can.

[quote="mechaquan, post:259, topic:16156"]
does this actually stop spam? The financial incentive to spam, maybe, but you can still market via a motion proposal to the IC voters for a mere 10 ICP!
[/quote]

1. This motion in question reduces the incentive to spam. The proposal of raising to 10 ICP just makes spam costlier. Both are valid tactics. Both may be ultimately done, maybe we need to both reduce incentive for spam and also make spam costlier to ultimately address the problem. That is very possible.

That being said, I will answer why your solution will NOT solve spam by itself:

0. Assume motion proposal costs go to 10 ICP.
1. If the tokenomic incentives remain, there are many people who would make more than 10 ICP per day from proposals in rewards. To them, the higher cost means nothing. Also, we have seen cases where people "crowdfund" the motion proposal cost. How many people can pay 10 ICP and still get rewards? Many. But maybe it is more insidious, if 20 people can receive 0.5 ICP per day each from a spam proposal, they can all pool it together.... again, something they would only do if there was an incentive. And we have seen this happen before.

[quote="mechaquan, post:259, topic:16156"]

I disagree the spam proposal was created to "pump a treasury" and I am not honestly not sure what more evidence I can provide for this in this thread. So let me reverse it: what data or evidence can i point out to convince you the spam proposal design is there to solve spam? Maybe the fact that it was actually proposed a while back and it was re-introduced? Not sure what evidence you are looking for. If you tell me what, I can be honest what evidence I know of and do not know of.

I agree. No it is not in same category as a security risk, my answer above only used a security risk as a metaphor to illustrate the design process: just because bad event X has not happened in a while, it does not mean it is fixed if the underlying cause still remains.

Being direct: I do not know what evidence to the contrary you are looking for. For example, I often ask myself, "I would change my mind if X was true" when crafting my own thinking. There are elements my beliefs pivot on. What is the X that would change your mind?

1. I have shown in this thread there have been many, many spam proposal2
2. I have shown the spam proposal tokenomic incentive remains (and likely to even grow with echange rate proposals change)
3. I haves shown that even if we accept the spam proposal and implement it, it does not necessitate or require any sort of NNS treasury so one does not follow the other.
4. In this thread I have linked to multiple open threads and discussions so nothing is secret, all pretty much in the open

What would convince you there is no secret ulterior motive between proposals? Or that one does not require the other?

This is a misunderstanding of the motion proposal in question: Spam proposal design.

The spam proposal **deliberately** calls out that it does not touch this issue (if it had, DFINITY would have voted against it).

DFINITY voted on the proposal in question, not their forum post.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-31 18:58:34 UTC | #263

@mechaquan **upon further reflection, I do not think I properly gave you the credit I do think:**

If you believe spam could trivially be solved by "raising to 10 ICP" and you see a more complex proposal that involves tokenomics incentives, I think it is reasonable for your spider sense to think, *"If the complex proposal just an smokescreen for something else... like a city council approving an unnecessary bridge just to funnel money to a company?*" I would think the same thing.

If I were you, I would also investigate further. 

Our differences of opinions really hinge on a few things:

1. I think the spam cannot be solved as trivially as you think
2. I think spam proposal for changing incentives is not that complex and it reduces ICP created
3. I think one can implement spam proposal and not be forced into anything else

**Does that make sense, what do you think?**

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 19:43:09 UTC | #264

Yes, agreed the treasury isn’t solutioned in the spam proposal but Austin does mention his preferred handling of the newly created “abandoned ICP” is to use it to fund a treasury so I do think it’s linked.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 19:51:35 UTC | #265

Sorry for the confusion…I was referring to the 10 ICP reject fee…not raising the proposal cost.

1) I agree it’s not trivial or easily solved…and my point is while the spam is no longer financially incentivized it doesn’t actually put anything in place to actually stop it.  Furthermore, people may still find it worth the 10 ICP rejection fee to use for marketing purposes.

2) agree, it’s not overly complex but we need to also appreciate that this reduces rewards to voters under the guise of spam prevention (that again I don’t see being a significant problem or actually solved)

3) agree nothing is forced except that it forces a reduction in voters rewards which now gives the pro-treasury crowd the funding mechanism without exceeding planned inflation 

Also, I want to say I really appreciate your time in responding and your always civil discussions!

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-10-31 20:27:16 UTC | #266

To be honest, what would help is people not openly advocating for removing stakers/voters rewards.

[quote="dfisher, post:1, topic:15839"]
`How Would Such a Treasury Get Funded?`

There are three options to fund such a treasury:

1. Increase inflation of all neurons
2. Reduce staking rewards from all neurons while keeping inflation constant
3. Reduce the staking rewards from only non-voting neurons (or another group of neurons)

The benefit of the third option, as proposed from @Kyle_Langham, is that this funding mechanism does not penalize voters who are engaged in governance. As such, it aligns incentives to get neurons to properly participate.
[/quote]

I find it incredibly convenient that the spam proposal achieves point #2…while also as mentioned previously doesn’t actually stop spam…just financially disincentivizes it.

I think we are now at the crux of the matter.

1. The proposal does not design that ICP should be used for a treasury. If it had, Dfinity would have voted against it.

2. You are quoting other people’s forum threads and asking me what I think, but this thread is about the motions and dfinity. I get that some people in the forum, proposed using ICP for an NNS treasury just like I’ve seen people in forum say a million things. Do you want me to defend what others think? The best I can do is clarify dfinity’s POV and occasionally clarify someone’s stand.

agree nothing is forced except that it forces a reduction in voters rewards which now gives the pro-treasury crowd the funding mechanism without exceeding planned inflation
[/quote]

It also gives the “burn ICP” camp less tokens in circulation. They also benefit.

It also gives the “reduce inflation rate, inflation is too high” camp what they want. They also benefit.

It is fair if people have differing opinions on the next steps of the consequences of the spam proposal, but I think you are painting a picture where only one camp gets what they want as a consequence of the spam proposal. There are many.

You can say disagree with one or all potential actions. I think that is reasonable in a design discussion.

**Dfinity supported the spam proposal because of the reduction of spam and no other agenda beyond that. We encouraged the original proposers to take feedback and submit it as a motion because we liked the way it reduced the Tokenomics incentive.**

Honest question: Would it have been better if Dfinity submitted the motion instead? We like to give credit to people who have ideas so we encourage them submitting, but we can always iterate.

1) I’m only saying that the spam proposal referenced using the abandoned ICP to fund a treasury which to me shows intent…maybe not Dfinity’s but certainly the proposers

2) No, of course not but this particular forum post was linked in the treasury temp check that Dfinity voted on…so that’s relevant, right?  To ask Dfinity to comment on a specific forum posted that they supported via a motion proposal?

Also, the quotes of forum post was because you questioned me on why I thought there was intent.  Spam proposal mentions treasury…treasury temp check mentions using reduced rewards from stakers…these aren’t hard dots to connect.

And before anyone comments it’s just a motion proposal…I know…and I want to raise it as a significant concern of mine before preceding any further.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-11-01 08:47:37 UTC | #271

Well I think if Dfinity proposed it then it probably/hopefully wouldn’t have referenced a treasury.

Finally, my last comment on this…wrt your comment on the tokenomic change…we’ve seen multiple tokenomics tweaks and changes which impact stakers and voters.  I seriously think this hurts NNS staking because it shows lack of stability in the terms with which you are staking.

Dom talked so much about platform risk and how the IC could solve this…which was one of the reasons I originally got invested in the IC.

Now a bit about me…and why I’m passionate about this…I work for a large multinational cloud service provider which sells outsourced services for AWS/Azure/Google Cloud…currently I see no way that enterprises would migrate to the IC.  

They may be centralized cloud providers but they have to respect contract law which makes it very difficult to actually deplatform.  I think it would be great if we could strive for more stability and less tokenomic tweaks.

Same here, I (incorrectly on my part) assumed ICP brings stability security and confidence to platforms and investors


These tokenomics changes have really made clear the quicksand in which were building

I don't know what Dfinitys and ICPs next moves are but I hope at the very least they're clued up enough to acknowledge and try address these issues

**Full disclosure: I do NOT work on Tokenomics or on positions of DFINITY within Tokenomics analysis and reccommendations (even in this spam case, I had to read up on this issue... you will see I was absent in the forum discussions), so I do not have anything wise nor special info to offer here**. 

I will say that the folks who do work in Tokenomics within DFINITY are reading this thread and I will also escalate this further.

If you want to know my opinion, I will just say what I have already written many times before publicly when recent tokenomics changes are proposed: 

> 
> I support more good faith debates in ICP, even when I disagree. Thank you, Smaug for taking the time to share your ideas in good faith.
> 
> To be honest... I am very much a “*dont do big things in complex systems*” kind of guy. You could argue i am risk averse in tokenomics.
> 
> The idea of either *locking* OR *unlocking* any large amount of neurons changes the rules so much for my taste, that I would like to see some data or experiment to make sure it does more good than harm. I can come up with lots of stories where its good for the ecosystem and equally i can create stories where its bad, so I rejected this because “too rich for my blood.”

@kvic  I have to be honest: I am not sure I follow what your diagram means or how it relates to DFINITY's votes on the two motion proposals in question.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-11-10 04:51:31 UTC | #276

My diagram is fitting to the discussion that had been held in this very long discussion.

But as far as your question about spam is a circular one, you keep putting up things about the spam but it is in no one's best interest to do anything other than write the same old thing.

Spam is about getting extra rewards but let's start at the beginning, there are three types here, inactive or dead people, active or the ones that just stand by and look on and then there are the activists and they are not only spamming or supporting spamming but want dead people rewards.

Funny that after all this time the activists have alerted a new group calling themselves the treasury that stated they could tap into the dead people neurons who saw the potential to direct funds away not only from dead people but the Activist rewards as well which I displayed on my diagram where they would in an underhanded way achieve this.

The whole intention is to funnel away rewards from said dead people for their own personal intentions and not for the best of all.

Put a link on the NNS to this forum and instead of not being transparent in saying on the NNS that your can reap rewards by following, update it with you may get reduce rewards by following and here is the link to all those who want to funnel away your rewards and how they want to do that with code behind the scene.

While there are many percentages about how many dead people there are I wonder by being transparent many of these dead people would come to life.

So I personally believe you @[diegop](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-80970-spam-proposal-and-86639-temperature-check/16156/275) are a supporter of the activist and really not it your interest to fix anything.

Sorry, I am not really sure I follow.

1. Who is the activist? And what do they support? I suspect a quick clarification can clarify. Are you referring to the folks who posted NNS treasury? 

2. Are you referring to dfinity’s official stance or my personal opinion? (I note when it’s my personal opinion). 

3. If referring to the NNS treasury forum post, Is there any example where I have supported it?

Fwiw, I did not mean to insult your diagram (I hope I did not come off that way), I was only being honest: I do not understand it so I asked for clarification.

To be intellectually honest, I do not support the idea posted about NNS treasury, but I wholly believe to NOT be the case. I honestly believe it was done to decentralize growth for all. And even then I did not like the mechanisms.

Respectfully, I do not think there is any evidence that can change your mind, because I’m not sure what evidence folks have of bad intent… other than hearsay. 

That being said, intent is tricky and I also have very little evidence to my opinion about their intent so it’s reasonable for people like you to defer to “the worst possible intent” as a way to guard their backs. I think this is very much in spirit of security and crypto thinking so I appreciate this POV.
