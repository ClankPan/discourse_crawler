Hello,

In my little journey to write a minimalist twitter clone on IC with Rust, I've tried to leverage unit testing to speed up development.

However, as it stands, it takes a while to run tests.  Even simple examples like counters (https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/blob/main/examples/counter/tests/basic.bats) takes a while.

A real app running on IC is probably going to have hundreds if not thousands of unit tests.

Are there any thoughts about canister emulators or a "dev mode" where you can run tests against your app and its optimized for speed rather than correctness?

Thanks much.
