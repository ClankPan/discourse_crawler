I want to create a nodeJS server for storing and streaming videos in my app. Is there any reason why i wouldn't be able to do that on the IC? just checking before i begin the work.

Well one of many limitations is that you can't run javascript in canisters, at least not yet [TypeScript/JavaScript CDK for the Internet Computer.](https://github.com/lastmjs/azle)
Another limitation is streaming through canisters, there's some issue with that, you can follow

In theory, somebody might build (1) a production-quality JS engine that runs on Wasm, (2) port node.js to that engine, (3) make the port compile into Wasm as well, (4) make all this run on the IC, where most OS services that node.js uses (like files, I/O, processes) are not available.

In practice, it is not likely that anybody would be keen on doing this.
