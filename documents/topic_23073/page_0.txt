Folks, we are so happy to announce — after a week of satisfying work — that we have not one, but *two* IC OS releases being proposed, both of them to make the IC move forward and be even more amazing than it was last week.

In addition to that, we have a bonus release that, thanks to the tireless work of @Tim, enables superior support for QUIC -- the next level of resilient networking for the IC.  The release is tagged [release-2023-09-13_23-01+quic](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/tag/release-2023-09-13_23-01%2Bquic) and has commit ID `d87954601e4b22972899e9957e800406a0a6b929`.  It carries a single, conservative change:

* [[04d06e58](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/04d06e584e483a79c25afd880dbc4788edfd4b25)] Networking: feat(IC-1437): Enable QUIC state sync

Get your votes in, so that the IC gets the improvements as fast as possible.

I love your enthusiasm on this one @dmanu.  I look forward to taking a closer look at the proposals and seeing what other reviewers have to say.

I would love to hear how you guys decide to put what commits in what release or how that is handled. 
I have seen a few times where pairs of updates come out instead of just one.
Mostly just curiosity

My thought was this is a side effect of human resource compartmentalization. With multiple teams working on different areas its possible the releases are done by teams and commits to releases are done by team members within said teams. That said you have me curious now on how this actually is done.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **124537**
Vote: **ADOPT**

Proposal ID: **124538**
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566222/nns-proposal-124538)

Voting history: [Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100&vh-topic=TOPIC_REPLICA_VERSION_MANAGEMENT)

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, and @massimoalbarello.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @Gekctek, @ilbert, and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.

@dmanu would you please ask the teams who worked on these proposals to take a look at the comments by @cyberowl on proposal 124537 and 124538 and by @massimoalbarello on proposal 124537?  The each had comments that the change owners might want to know.  I don't think any of their comments requires a response, but perhaps there are minor improvement opportunities.  Thanks for taking a look.
