If my canister spawns a new canister by instantiating an actor class, how do I upgrade that derivative canister?  It won't necessarily be in my dfx configs. It will be out there on the network somewhere and I guess I can catalog the canister ID in my original canister.  If I end up with a bunch of these and need to upgrade the actor class of that canister, how do I do that?  Am I going to have to pull the list and do some command-line scripting where I have to update my .json files?

I am interested in the same problem. How are you spawning derivative canisters now?

I interested too.
Do you solve it ?

My understanding is that you have to do it with the management canister. You literally have to push the wasm to the canister via dfx or some other method. I think dfx has a 1MB limit on the command line. I saw some chatter on the discord about it and Iâ€™m fairly sure someone is working of solving the problem a bit more elegantly.
