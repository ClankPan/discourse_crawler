While it will be the Governments of the world that hold organizations and individuals responsible for all content on the WEB3, we should then also hold the Government responsible for identifying those making the choice that the content they wish to be viewed is acceptable and not punishable by their Governments in their regions and they don’t break any laws across borders.

We who like to cross borders must have a passport and that passport contains personal information about the person that is held by the Government.

ICP should also create a Neuron that contains the passport number that is verified by the Country of origin and by their government.

Those who wish to challenge their right to post prohibited or false fee content can have their content flagged to the Government department by viewers of a page for immediate action that is needed to be taken with the ability to detain the flagged content by the Government.

There should also be a holding fee for each government flagged content that is returned on successful convictions or given to the author if found innocent.

This also extends the ICP to be a token of value and not just for cycles. The idea is that you need to sign up, create a membership or a website owner and instead of providing all your personal details all over the world. The Government of your country is the only authority that has your personal information and the rest of the world has your Neuron ID.

If you want to add content to the IC then you have your neuron attached and your passport can then identify you by only the government of your country and the laws that you must abide by or be prosecuted through the local laws.

This also extends the ability to make payments from your neuron and transactions that have been unlawfully extorted will have their neuron for dispute and local authority punishment. 

Do you really want a secure web and as the IC is it’s own community then we can set the laws through the NNS and show the world we are the right way and have the answers.

Absolutely against this. Anonimity is very important for the safety of users. Maybe you trust your government wholeheartedly, but consider the fact that there are repressive governments who do not respect human rights, and that even if your own government is "trustable" now, it can TURN repressive in the future.

Jabberwocky | 2022-10-09 17:03:14 UTC | #3

You need to go take some history lesson and look at the current state of the world if you trust governments this much

kvic | 2022-10-09 18:51:23 UTC | #4

Good idea or lets look at current stories of island and tribal lopping heads off, *Russia* -Ukraine *war* is not a government it is what you want and then there is something worse coming. Stable country's have governments and you want the stone ages.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-09 19:00:34 UTC | #5

I didn't say I trusted governments I said, **we should then also hold the Government responsible** I never said,**repressive governments who do not respect human rights** you put words in my mouth. 

Is it better to break down what we already have and make it work or go back to the stones ages. I have a great Government where I am and yes I do not trust them but it is much better than most countries.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-09 19:40:29 UTC | #6

There seems to be some misunderstanding about what a Government is. 

In my country there are no soldiers in the street, no guns held by citizens and if I am rude to the police or Government officials I am not beaten or worse.

My Government listens to the people, allows crypto and all I have to do is pay tax on gains.

It seems that some seem to think **A repressive government is one that restricts people's freedom and controls them by using force.** you give them that power by your own words because I call them cowards and takers of life, not a Government.

There are many countries that have Governments that work well without repression and we can have the system that I outlined that will be the envy of the world.

What we do see and in our own NNS is citizens that spam and others who take our information and use it against us and state that it is their right. That is being repressive.

My Government and many others will be held responsible if we hold them responsible and they on our say so will protect our information and themselves be accountable if they do not protect our information by us the people.

Stop giving power to those who only want to control and harm you and stand up for the parts of the human race that have learnt from the past that war achieves nothing and great civilizations came about after the wars stopped and through proper Governments.

If governments feel there's a problem on the network, they should submit a governance proposal. Now wouldn't that be fun?

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-09 20:54:22 UTC | #9

Fair enough but I want to break this idea down a little more.

The Proper Governments have your details already and if you travel they issue you with a passport. I have a proper Government passport and have Crypto. 

My government asks me what crypto I have as they don’t know, nor do they have my Neuron ID, nor does the neuron have my personal details.

How is this a bad idea?

If a neuron holder breaks the law then the Organization who has content that is forbidden by public standards which is what proper Governments hold up for their citizens that flag that content is taken down and then the Government by law has to request the neuron passport ID from the public organization which is then put through the public court system for prosecution.

What we have now is our personal information scattered all over the world and with criminals.

Everyday my friends are receiving text messages from liars and thieves who could not do this if they only had my neuron details as my username and password.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-09 21:07:26 UTC | #10

My Government does not speak for me but as a citizen I try to change things for the better with crypto projects and have not requested their approval, they instead have let their citizens invest into crypto projects without prosecution and have accepted that a huge majority feel that it is their right and just watch and have at no time threaten me.

It is not the Government who should submit a governance proposal but it is my right as an IC Neuron holder.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-10-10 07:25:36 UTC | #11

To cite a potential specific example, a teenage Iranian blogs on an IC platform in favour of the current protests in her country and about participating in demonstrations against restrictive laws. According to you, the IC should help the Iranian government identify and punish the blogger?

Zane | 2022-10-10 07:34:54 UTC | #12

I'm happy your government is so caring and progressive, unfortunately not everyone in the world has the same luxury.

Azat | 2022-10-10 14:32:15 UTC | #13

kvic, I'm wondering why you, having such a good government, are interested in web3.
I am not from the Western world.
Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been amplifying the Western voice and silencing anyone who opposes them through content moderation.
Therefore, they are blocked in our country.
YouTube didn't moderate the content, but it turned off monetization in my country, removing the incentive for bloggers to post content. (Youtube is not blocked)
My hope is that decentralized social networks will give everyone the opportunity to speak. Both worlds will be able to hear each other.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-10 16:23:01 UTC | #14

Again No, you have put words in my mouth but interesting you don't wish to listen or think about my idea while what you said is going on and maybe a way for this not to happen. How and why would IC collaborate and who on the world stage would agree to release that personal information.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-10 16:25:44 UTC | #15

Nothing is perfect and I am happy that the Government is better here than most but would you rather I pull you up and show what can be than what is present in most countries and not acceptable.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-10 17:03:55 UTC | #16

There seems to be some confusion about this subject.

The Proper Governments of the world are stating that their citizens are asking for their Government to act on their behalf that certain content on the Web is not acceptable and should not be viewed.

The information that is not wanted does not include human rights but human degradation of children and women or pleasure. Also the ability for a person to steal our personal information, threaten us and demand or threaten and destroy a lifetime of hard work.

Why do we allow these people in our lives?

The Government has the power to force organizations to take down content **just as Dfinity does here on this forum** and if the law has been broken, personal details are released through proper channels which are the courts systems for prosecution on behalf of citizens.

I say we can take this opportunity to provide a system where the Proper Governments, who have all our personal details, anyway, keep it secure and not divulge this information to anyone.

That we as neuron holders on the IC don’t have to divulge our personal details within our neuron but are responsible to safeguard our neuron ID because of this fact.

That we as neuron holders agree that we believe in security for the proper neuron holders and not for those who use neurons for bad and evil purposes.

That we the citizens of the world can agree that each neuron must contain the passport ID that has been approved by our Governments within the neuron and the Government cannot invade our privacy of ownership as the passport ID can be a private field but through proper legal channels to prove a neuron has broken the law will need to subpoena for the passport ID.

I received a notification that this discussion was blocked yet this morning I received other comments and found that this discussion is still current.

I am lucky in my country but more and more my world is invaded by outside bad behaviors and just like you I look for answers but unless we take actions nothing will change.

We can’t work with many countries but we can work with those who show decency and morals. From there we may make changes for others to change also and work as a proper Government.

Having a passport ID on a neuron with Dfinity in a proper Government will not release any information to those who have no value in life but we can refuse those who have no values to stop from coming into our proper world values. We can then identify them and by not allowing them to pass through our world by travel or electronical when they have been recorded by law as being improper but we need a why of doing this.

I don’t claim to have all the answers but I can write a discussion on an idea I have and would like to explore. My news feed again this morning has more stories on bad people feeling it is their right to exploit others electronically and I am sick of it.

My suggestion here is about discussion and maybe from this a way of finding a path to a better world that we as people can build. You don’t have to give me an example of horror going on in the world but I would like to hear if you think this idea has merit or have a better way to extend this.

I read that post again, and did not see anything about Iran. I don't want to paraphrase anything because you might say I am putting words in your mouth. I will only say that no two people will agree on precisely which governments classify as 'proper', and governments and regimes change, sometimes radically.

kvic | 2022-10-11 07:21:53 UTC | #20

Hi Denis
As a discussion if I name something directly it could break discussion rules so I can't be specific and this discussion was closed but for what ever reason was reverse. 

I will post my conclusion  shortly and I hope you understand that for a country to request personal information of a blogger they would have to use the legal system to make IC release the passport ID by proving that the law had been broken which I don't believe that a first world country where Dfinity is home to could convince the local court to their local area to release personal information from a 2nd or 3rd world with human equality rights issues. Please read my conclusion read.

I would actually like to hear more from you, and anyone from these types of governments that do not allow mainstream media platforms you mention to give their opinion. I just recently stumbled into a deep realization of the depths in which censorship *actually* resides in my country; while promoting their own narrative. While I do agree with a good chunk of what "they" tell us they are protecting us from, such as illicit or obscene images of children, women, or individuals, or flat out live stream murders, I do agree that these same governments will use these tremendously terrible circumstances as a way to steal more data (whether its directly intentional from one single person or not) which is then harmful moving forward. 


@kvic I am interested in where you live. Personally, I am from the USA and I would want to move to where you are. If your government is proper, I want in, please. I am also looking forward to reading your conclusion. 

It should be noted that I am torn personally between how the content on the IC *should* be handled. I am from an area of the US that (without going into detail) has made me a question or re-visit a deep philosophical debate over "the line" we draw with things such as content moderation tools. No one should have there, or their family's murder live streamed while shopping, yet those in oppressive countries wishing to vocalize and demonstrate civic liberties (as we do in areas that are so privileged and self-entitled to do so daily without much repercussion) should be able to find the ability or voice to do what we already clearly have in some way. 

Please note* that I use the term "we" as a way to establish a divide because there is a clear divide between those who have the ability to speak their opinions on governmental affairs or politics, and those who would or may be punished by laws that prohibit it. So, there is an us and them in this situation and the "us" in this situation may have become so accustomed to our own freedoms that "we" should refrain from speaking on behalf of the communities to prevent further marginalizing them. 

At the same time, I want to prevent neo nazi fascists from live-streaming murders in any area, which seems to only be able to be done through overall content moderation tools (from my very simple and basic understanding). Therfore, my line is confusing and I have been waiting for such a debate to be held and then for leadership from Dfinitny to give their deliberation on this exact issue of "content on the WEB3". I personally am looking forward to experts speaking on censorship and user sovereignty

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-12 18:02:32 UTC | #23

The IC neuron has no personal details. 

We have a passport system for travelers on a world stage that should hold and protect your personal information, who should only release your personal information if the court finds the owner has been illicit and should be held accountable.

An IC neuron could hold a Passport Number in a private field that links the neuron owner to their personal information and the IC and any other identity or person does not have the ability to access your personal information.

Users on the Internet should be able to directly state an issue from the page on their device they are using of any illicit behavior.

The Global community should be able to reject content that they feel is not appropriate, they feel was asking for personal details or bank and card details to illicit money. If that content gets enough rejects then action should be taken on the communities behalf.

There are many levels we can take action for a neuron owner on the nns and votes would only be accepted by neuron holders that have the proven passport id.

We have our own internet exploria on the ic where nns neuron owners can vote on how to create and have these built in securities features. That by rejecting content that can only be uploaded from the ic internet explorer will contain the neuron ID for any and all content the owner places on the Web, that we can vote for the scale and actions we can take on the owner of these neurons that exceed certain percentages voted ranges.

As a final note the Passport ID can be released by IC on the direction of the International Criminal Court which should take in consideration the many concerns of human treatment. The main purpose is to discourage illicit behavior as their personal details could be given for prosecution from the passport id.

By using the World Government System, we as neuron holders do not have to be involved and they will have to perfect this system that they have already in place as it should be.

This link shows a possible data breach from a web2 company and the actions and reassurance of the Government to keep your personal data safe.

The International Criminal court is biased by design. In particular they would easily prosecute third world leaders compared to first world citizens. From an African perspective it is seen as a neocolonial tool meant to undermine African sovereignty . // https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002719893740 

Solution; Code is the Law; it is a matter of time before we see codifying of the law which can be executed through smart contracts. Governments would have to follow that code as it would be formulated by citizens of the world. 

It is hard to have a discussion about censorship without a product being censored. Talking about web 2 platforms in web 3 forums does not paint a clear picture about what is going on in the world. A better approach would be to specify what is being censored and at what geo location. If it murder, the solution is to design a safety net that would detect and red flag such horrific acts at web speed (*as soon as they are posted)*, and that would later be removed  from the platform only by approved personnels.

[/quote]

Now would it be considered censorship if those flagged videos are held in a state of "non-posting status" until the team (approved personnel) is able to determine if it is murder or flagged by a glitch in the system? To prevent them from being re-downloaded and spread despite removal or being flagged?  People are quicker than assigned personnel (unfortunately) and then it can still spread and reach a faction of violent individuals wishing to cause catastrophic damage. Or on the other hand, are these designs competent enough to determine whether someone is posting/ publishing a "Horror Film" rather than a single individual or group just posting murder(s) and or various horrendous acts of violence? I would hate for artists and various film producers to be flagged or categorized as the other sub-set I speak of. Please forgive me for my lack of technical skills, this may be something the community is well-versed in whereas I am obviously not.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-10-12 19:59:37 UTC | #26

What is not bias in design and did you not start out by undermining African sovereignty and then go straight in to making code without sovereignty.

Web2 and Web3 are different and so will be Web4. 

Code will be agreed to by the majority and it will remove the unwanted content and those responsible no if or buts

I beg to differ, No human is quicker than a computer. Classic example is when DEEP BLUE won over world class champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. What I am referring to is that, systems are superior in making decisions given the right programing. In this case, cooperation of the system or product of social interaction with personhood would make content modulation effortless. I been a victim of  content moderation but it came with advise of citing whatever I post. There has to be law, (*law creates order)*  and as far as there is hierarchy in the system on how to solve uncertainty then everything would be a success. 
If the worry is that someone would spread a video that was taken down then that is not worry at all. The system would make the right decision with a success rate of high probability. If an error occurs, that error only benefits the system as engineers can work around that to make sure it does not occur again. We have to come into the conclusion that this "is a marathon and not a sprint". ERRORS MADE ARE RESOURCES FOR SYTEM TO BE TRAINED ON. The rule of large numbers further supports the notion, that it would take time for perfection to come to reality, so the realistic thing is to expect outlier events that would challenge the system. 
In talking about horror movies, that is a piece of cake as the model of the product would be trained to detect what is what. https://mindy-support.com/news-post/using-ai-to-fight-crime-how-police-use-ai/ 
And there can be channels opened for artists to file a claim if their content is being attacked by the system of the product. All in all, it boils down to the amount of resources allocated for such a system to work.

So we do agree that the majority will decided the levels that code will remove elicit content and the bias in most systems will need to be made to conform to expected level of decency but how about who we allow to put up content which is the problem as they need to be removed from and stopped polluting with what they think is acceptable and what about the passport id to also know who we need to prosecute or maybe help as we don't know their experience's

Stop the person or group by rejecting their neuron id's can become very costing also for them if we apply costs.

No the majority do not decide. The rule of law decides! 
Just relying on Simple Majority = Anarchy 
Just relying on Controlled Majority = Democracy 

There has to be a system that can make decisions, and everyone who participates in it adheres to those laws that are embedded in that system. 

I like quoting the Bible because it was a book to reference morality in the environment I was raised (Africa), and also most of the lessons in the Bible are similar to the Qua-ran and other religions books. I bring that up to make a point about the parable of the lost sheep. For those unaware of the lessons of the parable of the lost sheep, 
*In summary it talks about a shepherd who left his 99 sheep to find 1 that is lost. This to me reflects our modern day activities ( or politics) that majority is not always right, what’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong. To put it in perspective in the current discussion, defining clear goals and laws is better than trying to rely on the majority. I am for decentralization but you just do not get there. There is a process. That is what nature does. And nature is law. So is mathematics, the language of the universe.* 

When I was first censored online, I took it upon myself to research the difference between emotional and practical logic. It took time for the difference to internalize but finally i was able to master the concepts. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050437/
In designing my programs they have to align with mathematics and existing laws.  An example is to prevent sybil attack, 2/3 of the network has to be operational.  That is something you can prove with math. 
Going back to censorship, it is only right if it can b proved by math and not feelings;  by cause and effect. This can be done by training neural networks on decision making. That is all I can say as of now.

@JxBrian What I meant by "faster than approved personnel" was that, say the videos were *not* held in a query of sorts *until* a team *could* determine, and they just uploaded everything, and the team *then* had to remove it. That is what I was referring to as an example scenario. I was not implying that it was correct or what would happen. Please reread this section, as I am new to the industry, and am by no means trying to imply or insinuate that I *do* know, because I don't. I am coming at this particular conversation from the lens of a "student" looking to learn or hear from more experienced users and developers on these issues.
