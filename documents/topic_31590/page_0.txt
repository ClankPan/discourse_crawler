According documentation, the Sns proposal type [UpgradeSnsControlledCanister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals/#upgradesnscontrolledcanister) requires an optional parameter `mode : opt int32`.

At first glance, I would have expected it to be a variant similar to the `canister_install_mode` of the IC spec. However, since it is an optional number and no particular notes are provided in the documentation, I'm a bit confused about it.

What is the mode and what are its values?

Yes, sorry, this is poorly documented. Here is the mapping:

```
  CANISTER_INSTALL_MODE_INSTALL = 1;
  CANISTER_INSTALL_MODE_REINSTALL = 2;
  CANISTER_INSTALL_MODE_UPGRADE = 3;
```

These are defined in the ic repo [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/protobuf/def/types/v1/management_canister_types.proto#L6-L9).

By the way, the latest master of quill can create UpgradeSnsControlledCanister proposals and supports setting the mode ([docs](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/blob/d649fb5658d052bef811a6ce95d0ae0a9ff37685/docs/cli-reference/sns/quill-sns-make-upgrade-canister-proposal.mdx#L4)). However I'm not sure this version of quill has been released as I landed this functionality fairly recently.

Aaaaaaah, it's because of protobuf. Got it now. Thanks a lot for the feedback!

If anyone is ever interested, here's the mentionned link to the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/protobuf/def/types/v1/management_canister_types.proto#L5-10](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/protobuf/def/types/v1/management_canister_types.proto#L5-10)

Thanks, but I don't plan to ever use Quill.
