Hello everyone!

We have recently updated the [Awesome DFINITY](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity) repo with more examples, as well as [guidelines](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for adding your own projects. We hope that with your help, this list will continue to grow and serve as a valuable resource for the Internet Computer developer community. We can't wait to hear more about what you're working on and look forward to supporting you! :rocket:
