Hi folks! Just a quick heads up that we've overhauled the II [README](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity#readme) and added a [simple example](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/tree/main/demos/using-dev-build#readme) that you can just copy to get a working II integrated in your own projects. If you're curious about how II works, or if you always wanted to write a canister with authentication, now's the time!

If you have a look, I'd be very thankful if you could share some feedback here or through GitHub tickets/PRs, especially if things aren't clear.

Thanks!
