hi does anyone know of anyway where an NFT created on the IC can be locked and re-instantiated on an ETH based chain?

Sort of like how BTC/XCP based assets can be moved between BTC and ETH so that they can be listed and traded on OpenSea?

Or if I have an ERC based NFT how can I move it to the IC?  I found this but it mentions nothing about erc20 nor about ERC NFTs standards https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/20273018220180-What-are-ckETH-and-ckERC-20-tokens-

thanks!

XP.Network is a cross-chain bridge for NFTs that has integrated ICP: https://docs.xp.network/docs/nft_standards/ICRC7/

In addition, there's the following PoC by @b3hr4d and @decentralised.trade using chain-key Signatures (threshold ECDSA) implemented during a hackathon: https://github.com/b3hr4d/cknft
