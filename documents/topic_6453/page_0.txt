When a Variant is seariled to candid for shipping over the wire to another canister in a XCanister call, how many bytes is the tag for the variant?

For example, If I have type = {#myVar : Nat32;}, how big would that be?  4 Bytes for the 32 bit Nat and then how much for the myvar tag?

Use case:  Xcannister calls are limited to around 2MB and if I have a big array of my type I need to know when I need to chunk it up.

As long as your variant _type_ has no more than 128 different tags a variant value costs one byte plus the contained value. If the contained value is of type `null` (as it is in the enum case), that does not take any space.
