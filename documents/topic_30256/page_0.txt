First off, I'm not a developer and that might be the main issue with me in here as it seems to be mainly for coders and developers.
I'm a visual artist with illustration, graphic design, 3D, and is very into stable diffusion these days training custom Lora's.
I believe in this chain so I have staked icp in certain projects but it is extremely difficult to know what I am voting for. Any chance the process gets dumbed down or made easier to digest what is actually being proposed for the people that isn't heavily developed orientated?

Hey mate, the CodeGov.org named neuron is perhaps a good follow. https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356 
Dfinity’s neuron is also a good follow, but this is of course if you want to follow a named neuron for the governance proposals. Probably won’t help you learn or become more knowledgeable if that is what you want.

I feel your pain as a non-developer myself.  I don't think much can be done to dumb down the language because the proposals are of things at the protocol level.

[DAOs and tokenomics | Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/overview#:~:text=Neurons%20are%20encouraged%20to%20vote,subnets%20to%20balance%20network%20load.)
> Neurons can then vote on proposals, which are **proposed changes or upgrades to the protocol**.
> 
> Some examples of proposals for changes that the NNS is responsible for deciding are:
> 
> * Upgrading the protocol and guest operating system software used by the nodes machines.
> * Configuring parameters that control how much must be paid by canisters for resource usage.
> * De-activating under-performing nodes to protect the network.
> * Inducting new node providers and machines into the network.
> * Creating new subnets to increase network capacity.
> * Splitting subnets to balance network load.

You can also read the "Proposal Topics" section of this page:
[Neuron and proposal details | Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/proposal-requirements#proposal-topics)

As you can see, the topics are mostly about technical stuff, so you can expect that there will be technical language to go with that.  Honestly, I just vote even if I don't understand the proposal or just follow a neuron with a good voting record.


Either way...Welcome to ICP, and enjoy the ride to the moon. :rocket: :sunglasses:
