Hi @rizu 

There is currently no easy way to do this. Could you describe your use-case a bit better for us to understand why you want to do that?

Thanks!

I wanted to deploy a static application on ICP, so I created my identity on the browser connected that identity with the NNS Account, and purchased ICP tokens.I couldn't find a way to connect my identity account on cmd dfx.

I recently found that we can't connect the NNS identity to dfx developer identity so I transferred some ICP tokens to my developer account.
i can see my balance with command
`dfx ledger --network ic balance`
but when I am running command
`dfx deploy --network=ic`  

I am getting error, can you please help me to resolve this one?

we can't transfer NNS Identity account to dfx, so you will have to create new identity with dfx and get account-id and transfer the ICP from NNS identity account to dfx identity account.

about creating a wallet you need to follow,

`dfx identity get-principal` (you will get principal-identifier)
`dfx ledger --network ic create-canister <principal-identifier>  --amount <amount>`
`dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet <created canister>`

you can get cycle with this command
`dfx wallet --network ic balance`
then you can deploy the application.
`dfx deploy --network=ic`

This is by design. II does not require the user to keep track of secret material. In fact, its not even possible to obtain private keys of your identity as a user! 

Developers can easely generate and take responsibility of self managed keys as you describe
