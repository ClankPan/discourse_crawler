Installing Plug wallet on firefox requires granting the following permissions.
1 Access your data for ALL websites.
2. Display notification and 
3. Access browser tabs. 

Does it really need these permissions, seems a very broad authorization? As a reference, does Metamask require the same set of permissions?
