We are looking to partner with a front-end developer with experience in:

* Integrate with an Internet Computer Native wallet. 
* Authentification and transfer of tokens payment. 
* Experience in: https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js Experience in react/nextjs, javascript/typescript and internet identity (icp).

We have a team but are missing a front-end with specific experience. Are you interested in joining a upstart team - we have a clear product idea, and want to build something with others. 

We can't pay, but we can agree on a shared ownership of the product.
