The average person isn’t drawn to the complexities of Web3, but the universal appeal of music presents a unique opportunity. While platforms like TRAX offer subscriptions to specific artists, they struggle with user engagement and don’t fully leverage Web3 technology. However, there’s a growing interest in AI-generated music, evidenced by AI HUB Music Discord’s 600,000 members, despite DMCA concerns and repeated deletions due to copyright violations.

The viral AI song “Heart on my Sleeve” amassed over 100 million plays, highlighting AI music's popularity. However, platforms like SoundCloud and YouTube frequently remove these tracks, making it hard for enthusiasts to maintain playlists. AI music thrives in obscure corners of the internet, drawing an estimated 1 billion weekly plays and potentially missing out on $4 million in streaming revenue. The legal grey area surrounding AI music makes it difficult to find and share tracks, with traditional streaming services complying with big record labels’ takedown requests.

There is currently no centralized or decentralized platform for uploading, saving, and distributing AI music. 
ICP offers a solution storing music onchain where no central authority can remove it. ICP is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and provide a home for AI-generated music.

Hi @leo27,

Based on the reviews, the grants committee has decided to decline this application.

-------------------------

leo27 | 2024-06-21 09:05:48 UTC | #3

could you let me know why my application has declined?

The main points were that the underlying technical problem - storing media in a canister - has been solved many times and that the GTM strategy is unclear, i.e. there's a big risk, that this will just create the stage of a proof of concept, but the technical concept has been proven before.

You've already done quite some work and we appreciate also the motivation of this project, however, it'd be great to get more evidence that this has a chance to grow beyond a PoC.

Could you provide some guidance on how to get my application approved? :pray:

I'd encourage you to join one of the Developer Office Hours on Wednesdays in the ICP Developer Discord.
