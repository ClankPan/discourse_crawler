Hi there ICP community,

Jan Camenisch (CTO of DFINITY, @Jan ) and I want to address (and ask for clarity) on some concerns we have heard about recently in the community .

We want to open up a dialogue to understand a bit more.


## Concerns:

1. “*DFINITY is spending too much time and resources outside core protocol*”
2. “*The DFINITY Foundation is not good at UX and should not work on frontend things like NNS Frontend dapp*”
3. “*DFINITY should give more grants to the ecosystem rather than hire more.”*
4. “*SNS is too rigid. It does not work for my use case”*

## Where we agree

We agree wholeheartedly that the Internet Computer can only succeed with a vibrant developer and entrepreneur community. DFINITY is dedicated to supporting the community as much as it can. We also agree that currently the relative core strength of the DFINITY foundation is cryptography, systems engineering, and distributed systems compared to frontend engineering.

*“DFINITY should give more grants to the ecosystem rather than hire more.”*

We also agree that giving more grants to help the ecosystem is good. DFINITY developer grants are indeed accelerating in volume and teams and will also be used more strategically to target specific needs raised by the community including as libraries for dapps.

## Where we would like to provide some context

*“DFINITY is spending too much time and resources outside core protocol”*

1. **We think the perception here is understandable (we created it!), but not quite right** - many projects that people think DFINITY is working on are a tiny minority compared to cryptography or distributed systems work. As stated at the latest global R&D meeting, we will provide more frequent updates on the roadmap and hopefully in a format that gives better insight in what the teams are working on in what order of priority, but here are some numbers on the number of [people and priorities from July 2022](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-on-the-ic-roadmap-july-2022-summary/14615):

![|624x268](upload://6YruTWsXdNyLF4NG2Ma0k2JsXnS.jpeg)

* Note that items with a heart symbol are by request from the community and that priorities may change depending on input from the community and shifts in the blockchain market conditions.

2. **NNS Frontend Dapp and II are more than application level concerns** - NNS and the II authentication are an integral part of the Internet Computer and in particular it is essential that these components be highly secure, that is why it makes sense that the cryptography and security relative strength of DFINITY be invested at making these bulletproof.

*“The DFINITY Foundation is not good at UX and should not work on frontend things like NNS Frontend dapp”*

3. **The NNS Frontend dapp development was slow because of migration, not lack of UX skills** - We have seen this pop up a few times and it is also understandable. We agree partially with some of the conclusions, but not for the same reasons. Allow me to explain: 
A lot of the *“DFINITY is not good at UX*” perception came from the fact that the NNS Frontend Dapp was sluggish dapp (and it had wonky user experience). It is fair to say that the user experience of the dapp was not great in the months after Genesis and that the foundation possibly wrongly did not prioritize its enhancement enough during that time. However, I do not think the community understood why. There was a perception that DFINITY needed more design help for the dapp. But the truth was that the limiting factor is that the dapp had to be rewritten/re-architected entirely from one framework (Flutter) to another (Svelte) while still functioning as a safe governance and staking mechanism for many, many people. This [migration](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/network-nervous-system-dapp-is-moving-to-svelte/11668) took longer than expected… but once it finished, it became easier to dedicate energy to improving the user experience.

4. **We agree that NNS Frontend Dapp is not optimized (yet) so that entrepreneurs could ship “NNS frontend Dapp with a different UX”... but more work has happened here than folks may be aware of** - Some entrepreneurs have mentioned that they would like to take the code of something like the NNS Frontend Dapp and modify the UX so they can offer the security/safety of the dapp, but their own UX. This is a worthwhile goal! When I ask folks what is stopping them from doing this, some people tell me the NNS Frontend Dapp is not architected for such clean modularity (“keep the security, change the UX”) other than trivial CSS/HTML changes. ***What folks may not be aware of is that the NNS Frontend Dapp team did create a few libraries for the purpose of making it easy for the dapp to be adopted by others (in particular `nns.js`)***: https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js . It is apparent there may not significant attention drawn to these efforts (we should fix this)... but if these efforts do not address people's intent, let us know so we can iterate.

## Where we would like to understand more

When we hear folks say “*SNS design is too rigid. It does not work for my use case”*, we usually think two things:

1. “*Yes, we can always add more flexibility post-launch. Why do people think the SNS will not change?*”
2. “*The code is public. Folks can launch their own versions suited to their needs.*”

**That is why we are looking for ways to understand the community more here.** Also, while building this first version of the SNS, we were constantly talking to teams that aim to use the SNS to ensure a product-market fit.

**Below are some thoughts and questions we want to hear more from:**

1. Our intent is that the initial default SNS system be quite limited and rigid… then expand over time as the patterns emerge. Limiting scope and ensuring that that limited scope works end to end was intentional as to be able to release a first version as quickly as possible. Such a release also allows us to learn from usage and iterate to improve. We are honestly not quite sure why folks focus on the initial launch over the future iterations? Did our communications imply SNS will never change? **If so, that was our mistake.**

2. We have this nagging suspicion that the IC community sometimes speaks as if the SNS codebase is rather closed and prohibits innovation. But the SNS code is public so developers can learn from it, fork it, and build according to other needs. If we created this perception, then we need to rectify it. Did we imply or say in our communication that people should not be forking the code? Is the problem that it is feasible, but too painful to do this? **We want to learn so we can improve.**

3. We are also not sure why people sometimes speak as if SNS was the ONLY way to tokenize assets. Any entrepreneur can make their own smart contracts. Also, we highly appreciate anyone who builds their own governance and tokenization canisters, be it based on the ones we provide or totally from scratch, so that we can all learn from different approaches and explore different ways. At the end of the day, that is how a flourishing ecosystem is built and how progress is made. So, is the concern here that SNS would have some structural advantages that say “*Diego’s homegrown tokenized dapps*” would not? We definitely see three points of structural advantages the SNS has… Are these what folks are concerned about? 

  * Access to community fund
  * Having its own subnet
  * Press and promotions with DFINITY as a vocal promoter

## *Please tell us in this thread what you think. Thank you!*

For my part, I was under the impression that this was being developed as a protocol-level feature, much like the NNS itself. I think there are many in the community who already see this as the "trusted" solution for governance on the IC. I don't think it's an overstatement to say that most viewed the SNS as the ERC-20 of the IC.

Again, just speaking for myself, I was a bit shocked to learn that deploying an SNS in a decentralized manner required an NNS proposal. To me, that seemed to counter Dom's vision of a developer in a coffee shop (implying no real funding or backing) raising funds for their application.

That being said; @Jan reached out on Twitter to let me know that this requirement was driven by a technical constraint and is not something that is desired long term. That made sense, but I still fear that larger well known teams that are permitted to launch through the NNS will have a significant advantage over smaller developers.

Edit: I just want to add that I appreciate you and DFINITY for asking these questions. I think this is a very complex environment and it's good to have open discussions like this.

-------------------------

rusty.scrivens | 2022-07-30 01:35:42 UTC | #3

I know it's not related to the SNS related questions, but one bit of feedback is the road map is missing the two proposed features which were approved 3 and 6 months ago (55651 & 38985) and that the community is currently trying to communicate is very important to them via the ongoing proposal 72189.

I'm guessing they're included in the "..." but I don't think that gives the right message to the nns/governance community, it basically suggests those features didn't even make the "later" list.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-07-30 02:30:17 UTC | #4

Based on the fact that almost every R&D work took longer than expected... took the BTC integration as an example, how many time you postponed the plan? As a community member that don't fully understand the code, I just feel that seems that the Dfinity team is not so believable because they postponed the plan again again and again and don't provide the R&D changed real-time details, how can the community members could believe based on that? 

Do you think about that the team could:1) drive more other engineers to do some work? 2) Provided more real-time R&D details so maybe more engineers from the community could get involved in?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-07-30 02:33:11 UTC | #5

I probably need a longer post, but I’ll offer that there is a bit of a “suck the air out of the room” issue. You guys have to deliver to a high standard, so when you say your going to do something everyone assume you will do it well and thus *we don’t need to do it so let’s do one of the other 1_000_000 things that need to be done.*. I don’t have a solution for it, but it is an observable phenomenon.

Some pod cast recently mentioned the Heisenberg principal…something something if you observe something you change it…When dfinity says they will do something they change who else works on it and **raise expectation for it’s delivery**.  Dfinity can’t launch an experimental product because too much is kn the line and people feel this inherently. We should have 10+ independent dao and instead have 2 and one announced because dfinity announced the SNS. 🤷 What do you do.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-30 13:44:33 UTC | #6

I think DFINITY needs to keep providing explanations like this in response to community concerns, keep asking for feedback, keep iterating, and most of all, keep pressing forward.  The foundation is doing a fantastic job and setting a good example.  It’s impossible to make everyone happy.

-------------------------

harrison | 2022-07-30 14:06:49 UTC | #7

This issue I have is these heart symbol 'the community requested this' features. Were all of those put up for NNS vote? If not, why? And who is deciding what community requested features to prioritize? Bc I know we (Psychedelic) have requested features, I know Jordan Last has suggested many important features/improvements, DSCVR, and others, and a lot of those don't seem to be on your list. 'Anybody with a twitter account' should not be the bar for who is allowed to influence the entire roadmap of the protocol, that right should be earned. And I don't think the foundation should have unilateral authority to decide which community suggested features get prioritized. That should be the decision of the community/NNS. 

So here's one suggestion. Make that process transparent. Each community requested feature should include WHO is requesting it (the most prominent 1 or 2 projects or people in the space requesting it), along with an explanation of why and how urgently they need it for their use case. And then let the community/NNS decide and prioritize which ones to work on. 

It's not so much what the foundation is working on that's the issue. The issue is more so how the foundation is deciding to work on these things and how the foundation is making these important roadmap decisions in a silo and then hiding behind hand-wavy NNS votes or excuses like 'the community requested it!' to justify it. That needs to stop.

It seems like you are describing how forum deliberation and NNS Governance Motion proposals are supposed to be used.  Why not try it?  Write up your most pressing feature and post it in the forum under Governance.  Deliberate for a week or two.  Submit to the NNS as a governance proposal.  Then you’ll know what the community and governing body thinks.

-------------------------

harrison | 2022-07-30 15:01:00 UTC | #9

That doesn't really solve the issue I talked about. I want to see it done for all the heart symbol denoted features that the foundation themselves shared and are apparently already decided to be on the protocol roadmap. Each of those should be written up, and who (top 2-3 projects/people/advocates for the feature) should be known and each of them should write a short description (1-2 paragraphs is enough) of why they want it. and then lets vote on it/discuss it and/or rank all of those currently listed with hearts from highest priority to lowest priority/don't work on it. adding new features into the conversation at this point would just complicate things. they've already got their plate full. lets try to clear some room first.

dfisher | 2022-07-31 00:19:07 UTC | #10

It’s nice Dfinity is listening to the community and working on suggestions. It makes the community feel heard and acknowledged and motivates them to build and participate. 

That said, Dfinity is a centralized entity with its own views on what is important. Dfinity makes no pretenses to be decentralized. It’s the IC whose goal is to be decentralized. 

I’m not sure why Dfinity needs to do anything the community suggests if it disagrees with those suggestions. 

One day once the IC is a smashing success there’ll be many foundations with competing goals and resources. The IC will compete with AWS. 

Again to me making suggestions to Dfinity is great! It shows care and dedication. But it seems a bit odd to demand those suggestions be acted on.

-------------------------

harrison | 2022-07-31 00:53:24 UTC | #11

That's fine if they want to do that. But then they should just communicate that and stop wasting peoples time with the on-chain governance/NNS stuff. Like what was the point of putting those 25 roadmap items up for NNS vote when the protocol just launched? That obviously sends a signal to the community that the foundation wants the NNS in control of the roadmap. But then all their actions since then seem to indicate that isn't the case and the foundation is just going to do whatever it decides it wants to do. So again, if they want to do that that's fine, that's how most other protocol foundations operate. But lets remember they are the ones who made a big deal about on-chain governance and how differentiated they are because of the NNS, and they are the ones who started out by putting roadmap items up for NNS vote. So if things have changed since then, the least the foundation could do is communicate that to the community.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-07-31 01:03:46 UTC | #12

I think that’s fair criticism with respect to putting up the roadmap on the NNS. 

That said, it seems clear Dfinity does want to solicit feedback and involve the community. It wants people to feel acknowledged and to learn and grow and improve. They know they will make mistakes and want the feedback. But again, ultimately, management will make the decisions they believe are best for the future of the IC. 

It is not fair to paint the picture in black and white and say it’s either all or nothing, ie it’s either the community decides what Dfinity works on or Dfinity management decides what they work on. 

The reality is that at the end of the day Dfinity management will decide but they deeply care about incorporating everyone’s views. But of course, only to the extent they agree.

In theory it is possible for Dfinity to be so out of touch they don’t listen to the community at all and their views diverge entirely from the community in spite of best efforts to listen. I really do not think that is the case and it would not be fair to say so. All you can hope for is that your suggestions are internalized, considered, and given serious thought. That is a sign of respect and based on this post from Diego it is exactly the message that has been sent.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-07-31 01:04:07 UTC | #13

For the time being it seems that only DFINITY has resource to develop, for example almost all the ICP tokens of Foundation are held by DFINITY, so the decentralized road should be lead by DFINITY. I was wondering if DFINITY has any plan to drive the Internet computer to be decentralized including distribute ICP tokens to other teams in the future?

I believe in the short and medium time, we can only rely on DFINITY rather than other teams, so DFINITY need to do the core R&D things is not what they have and need to do.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-07-31 02:31:44 UTC | #14

@diegop 

Is it safe to say that the foundation takes notice of community driven proposals, but reserves the full right to unilaterally act for or against the implementation of those proposals?

Let’s take for example the proposal to reset governance rewards weights to 1. The first time that proposal was sent to the NNS by @skilesare it was rejected by DFINITY and the community.

Had the community passed that proposal, DFINITY still could have rejected implementing it, as the act of updating the code and submitting a change to the local replica technically still is an “off-chain action”.

As it’s own entity, it makes sense that DFINITY  reserves the right to ignore any action suggested by the community or the NNS.

Therefore, it would be beneficial for the community to be given the ability to submit changes to the local replica topic that would actually directly update various parts of the IC. 

However, to this date I don’t believe that the community has the permissions or ability to update the various canister replica code (NNS, II, ledger, core IC) .

That said, Dfinity is a centralized entity with its own views on what is important. Dfinity makes no pretenses to be decentralized. It’s the IC whose goal is to be decentralized.
[/quote]

Until the community receives the ability to propose direct code changes to the replica, the IC (not just DFINITY) remains under **centralized** control.

quinto | 2022-07-31 14:18:03 UTC | #15

I think these are two entirely different things that should not be mistaken for each other:

1. DFINITY asks NNS to vote on things it wants to work on.
2. A non-DFINITY organization (or person) asks NNS to vote on things it wants DFINITY to work on.

If we think NNS is a form of governance, is it democratic or totalitarian? Should it have overarching power to decide what/how a person or organization operates?

@harrison Do you want anyone other than you to submit a NNS proposal to decide what you work on?

Most likely you don't. And yet, you think DFINITY given its unique position in this ecosystem should be subject to this commandment. I'd like to hear your reasons. Thanks!

They certainly have communicated on the progress (and obstacles along the way) in this thread: [Direct Integration with Bitcoin](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-bitcoin/6147). I think they are earnest and believable.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-07-31 22:05:29 UTC | #17

I don't disagree with your point, but I do think DFINITY may have contributed to this. For example, here is a statement from Jan when I asked how the foundation plans to handle community proposals:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-request-for-neuron-indexing/11183/46?u=lightninglad91

"... mandate to work on a topic.." is pretty strong language. It makes no promises of when that proposal will be implemented, but it does tell the community that directing DFINITY's work through motion proposals is acceptable.

-------------------------

ovictor | 2022-08-01 01:42:54 UTC | #18

I really do support Dfinity taking some resources to build the application layer while the community is still growing and it is not big enough. Right now, there are just a few (all in early stage) products: SNS, Identity,Token Standard,etc. They serve as kickstarters for new projects. If someone thinks SNS does not fit, great, create your own DAO solution. This is very helpful to the ecosystem.

Ah that makes sense. Yes, this is a technical requirement for decentralization in short term (I admit I am not an expert on why it is a requirement since I am not in the weeds here), and my understanding is that they intend to remove this long term.

To be honest, I have heard this brought up few times and the fact that Jan and I did NOT list this in our top 3 community concerns shows it was not top of mind for me, so I have definitely learned my lesson.

Fwiw folks, my intent is to mostly stick to the rule of thumb of "asking clarifying questions" whenever I do not agree or understand something. The goal of this thread is for us to **understand** (not to change minds). 

So please know any questions I ask are with that intent (they are not pseudo-clever socratic devices for pointing holes... they are to clarify what I do not understand).

That is a very reasonable point. I will bring it up internally and also have mentioned it in the more relevant thread @samuelburri has on July 2022 Roadmap thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-on-the-ic-roadmap-july-2022-summary/14615/3

To clarify your intent, I know the R&D team posts frequent updates on the BTC integration (usually every other week or so) on the progress here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-bitcoin/6147, but it seems this does not address your intent. 

* Can I assume you are looking for something more real time than weekly updates?
* Is weekly updates ok, but the main problem is that it is buried in a dev thread?
* both?

[/quote]

1. To some degree yes and no. A common pattern in software is that there is a point where adding more engineers to a project usually slows things down. The more impacftul thing is less more engineers, but more time & focus per engineer. An example may be how 2 months ago, DFINITY made it clear that BTC and SNS projects tae priority so that means all other requests or asks NOT related to these two were de-prioritized among the engineers. As cross-functional projects, these prjects have a core of engineers working on it full time and a another ring of engineers who support them (for example, if the BTC integration engineers need help from Crypto or Consensus team or NNS Dapp team, their requests now take highest priority). I would say that more focus/priority has sped up progress more than adding more engineers.

Does that make sense?

Dumb question @skilesare (to make sure I understand your point)... it sounds like in your observation, DFINITY is the "big, slow and high quality" player in the ecosystem that discourages the more nimble, agile startup-y players.

I agree 100%. Clearly, we are all iterating and learning. I can understand why some folks may think "you are learning or iterating too slowly", so accelerating the learning is (hopefully) something we are also doing.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-08-01 19:16:40 UTC | #27

To dig in a bit...and I'll answer the questions directly at the end...I think that there is a hidden 'feeling' that DFINITY moves slowly because there is so much on the line(like NASA)...have to dot every T and dot every I.  If you guys release trash it hits the ICP token much harder than if icOpossums launches a trash contract(apologies it icOpossums if that is a real thing).  We all kind of implicitly know this, so we know what you guys release is going to have the eyeballs + quality to do really well.  Everyone else out here is (relatively) scraping it out on fumes with a few getting a bit of VC cash to go further.  The community has to break things and release half measures to survive.  When choosing amongst a sea of future universes, why would you pick the one with a T-Rex waiting in it?  Even if it isn't hungry, no one is going to be paying attention to you because "look at that T-Rex!".

1.  Yes. I think you got it.*
2.  It isn't so much a "room" as it is what is the best use of my time.  When we have 1,000,000 IC devs all competing for the same spaces this distinction will go away and people will choose to compete because they know they can run faster than DFINITY, but right now it is more profitable and less risky to run in a different direction altogether to the blue ocean.

*I'll qualify slow, because I think that is unfair to the DFINITY team.  You guys have pulled off quite a bit and I'd qualify it as deliberate and through over "slow."  I also think that for some "big" things we 100% want this.  In other areas, we want/need a thousand experiments.

For me, these break down along "known knowns" and "known unknowns" fault lines.  BTC integration is a known, known.  No need to do it 100 different ways, we all know what we want, and we want to do it right.  Governance? No one knows how that is going to go. From the stories I've heard, even Dom admits that the one thing he doesn't know how it will turn out is the governance pieces.  For those, I think we need 1,000 experiments and the power of the market/organic evolution to help us find the best solution.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-08-01 23:55:59 UTC | #28

Hi @harrison, I think i get most of what you say, but I have a few clarifying (dumb) questions:

1. How much would your comment change if the heart emoji were removed from the roadmap posted [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-on-the-ic-roadmap-july-2022-summary/14615https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-on-the-ic-roadmap-july-2022-summary/14615)? I currently suspect that your process suggestions on prioritization & communication would *still be the same* so the heart emojis seem like a red herring... but maybe I am misreading and you put more weight into them than I am understanding.

2. like the suggestions for improving… regardless of how coupled they are to the hearts. I took the hearts as you using it as symbolic or sign of what could be improved under the hood. Did I get that right?

[quote="harrison, post:11, topic:14616"]
That’s fine if they want to do that. But then they should just communicate that and stop wasting peoples time with the on-chain governance/NNS stuff. Like what was the point of putting those 25 roadmap items up for NNS vote when the protocol just launched?
[/quote]

I am not quite sure I see the connection so I may be missing something. I see two things here, so can you clarify?

* When I (Diego) write about on-chain governance, i refer to the fact that the network is updated via NNS proposals with Wasm which folks vote on. I am not referring to the motion proposals. Indeed, many networks have motion proposal type systems... what is technically unique about the IC is about the actual updating of the code.
* So to me the "25 motion proposals" were laying out the intent DFINITY had about the IC and wanted to see what people thought, since they involved upfront investment or hiring and working.

So my question is this:

1. Did you not appreciate the proposals on Long Term R&D? Did you see them as on-chain governance? https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-proposals-on-long-term-r-d-plans/9261 (totally fine if your mind changed from when proposed December 2021 to now)

2. Is my definition of on-chain governance too narrow? (it may be!)

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-01 19:36:41 UTC | #30

In my opinion even without the hearts priorities seem a bit all over the place and Dfinity should have done a better job at communicating why the roadmap looks like this, the hearts just makes it *weirder* cause they are supposed to represent community's interest, but some of the tasks have been rarely if ever talked about as far as I know. I agree with Harrison's take, we should have more infos on Dfinity's internal decision making: Who requested those features? Have they been prioritized cause they are dependencies for something else? Why have they been prioritized over other stuff? etc...

To expand on this... the classic version of this thought is "*what if community wants a feature X that DFINITY's crypto team thinks is too insecure or risky? to implement*" would that be an example of what you mean?  

(I can imagine others, but wanted to give a concrete example to further clarification)

I asked lots of questions so I wanted to circle back that its very clear to me folks want more visibility (as a minimum) into the prioritization of engineering work.

I also wanted to say that I believe the following can both hold (so people can understand my meta-thinking):

1. DFINITY has continually provided more visibility externally as well improved its internal processes. I believe it is leagues beyond where it was at Genesis.

2. DFINITY is nowhere close where it wants to be on either of those, so it is very reasonable for people to say "Not there yet" or "need more of this" or "keep working on it."

I certainly do not take it personally when someone like @harrison or @skilesare @lastmjs or @Zane say "we need more", because I know these folks have invested greatly in time and resources into the ecosystem. (not to discourage other folks from commenting, but I wanted to be clear that I can agree when people say "we need more").

If anyone thinks either #1 or #2 are completely off in another planet, please let me know. Always ready to change my mind.

You guys have made huge strides and it is mostly due to your efforts.  Keep it up. #WAGMI.

In my personal experience, I have always received an answer when I've asked a question. Sometimes I didn't like the answer or the date is further away than I want.  Sometimes I backdate the date a couple of months :grimacing:, but I always at least get an answer.  As a programmer, I understand how hard this stuff is and I can also understand the frustration some have that don't see the difficulty underneath all of this stuff. 

I also don't fault DFINITY for being the 500 lbs gorilla in the room.  Navigating this stuff is hard and it is why we are going to do it when very few others will try.  Keep turning the crank.  Make a better crank. Turn that one faster.

I see thanks for taking the time to find the tweet, I don't understand why Dfinity decided to overengineer the SNS so much and integrate it into the NNS, I heard many conflicting reasons by Dfinity devs, at first it was meant to give more visibility and liquidity to projects, then it was about avoiding user exposure to blatant scams and rugpulls and now its due to a technical reason.

It's extremely basic, it lacks all the token related functionality: staking, initial distribution, etc... and doesn't have any UI, a good place to start but far from the "no code" solution the SNS is meant to be.

@diegop 

Can you clarify this point that Jan made a couple months back?

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-request-for-neuron-indexing/11183/46

Also, there was talk of a "blog post" that would be released on this subject.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-request-for-neuron-indexing/11183/47

I think a lot of this "pushback" from the community is coming from either a big miscommunication, or a flip-flop of DFINITY's position in terms of it's relationship to the community and the NNS. 

We're all just trying to find out where DFINITY stands with respect to the community, and to the NNS.

* What are DFINITY's **mandates** to the community and the NNS (are there any?)
* What are the activities that it partakes in to **oblige** the community (but does not feel it is mandated to do so and could refuse).

It would be nice if communications at DFINITY could draw these lines for us.

Not sure what you mean with "overengineer the SNS" therefore just want to point out the fact that from the NNS-dapp frontend, "JavaScript code wise", and my personal perspective, it is being developed with the same architecture as NNS related services - i.e. not "over-enginered"

There is a JS library `sns-js` that is being actively developed so that  NNS-dapp can use it to interact with Snses but also, so that any devs can use and embed Sns related features in their dapps or NodeJS scripts without having to rewrite that particular layer.

It's the same approach as with the other library `nns-js` for Nns.

Both libs are available in a [mono-repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js) but, still need proper documentation as @diegop said in his original post. That's the plan.

Hope this clears a bit some worries about "overengineering" the frontend. Let me know if you have questions about it.

I semi get this. Not quite enough if I were tasked to fix it (the bar for true grokking).

To me a simple Tokenized dapp DAO that would address your intent would be:

1. A ledger canister 
2. A governance canister that uses tokens from #1  to vote and execute on code upgrades 
3. A backend canister controlled by #2
4. A frontend canister controlled by #2 

Would that be closer to what you are looking for?

ICP is not Ethereum and Ethereum is not Bitcoin. Just as the functioning of the Bitcoin network cannot be a model for the Ethereum network, the functioning of the Ethereum network, which has fostered a bunch of centralised monopolistic providers, is not a perfect model for the IC. The IC does far more than Ethereum can ever hope to do and consequently the Dfinity Foundation has to build out further than the Ethereum Foundation does, way beyond 'core protocol'.
Having said this, there are trade-offs in the Foundation building apps as a number of contributors have pointed out. While I strongly support the initiative to build the II, and think the SNS is also a net positive, there is no doubt that there are downsides. First, Dfinity remains all-powerful and the final decider on prioritisation, as @harrison has pointed out. Secondly, a crowding out of developer initiatives in areas that Dfinity has staked out, as @skilesare has recorded.
My suggestion is that Dfinity should adopt a five year decentralisation roadmap. In this, the philosophy of the Ethereum Foundation is absolutely relevant:

"We often describe this as a philosophy of "Subtraction". This means resisting the natural tendency of organizations to grow and accumulate value within themselves, and cultivating value creation outside the Foundation in the broader Ethereum ecosystem:
Instead of capturing opportunities, we distribute opportunities for others.
Instead of being defensive when others create value, we’re thrilled.
Instead of trying to matter more, we try to matter less."

The first five years of the IC involved Dfinity directing almost all development. The five years from genesis should aim to put Dfinity on a path of subtraction, where its workforce first plateaus and then begins shrinking as independent developers gain more leverage. The third five years would involve the philosophy of subtraction being fully realised, and nominated developers gaining voting rights within Dfinity itself, so that the Dfinity neuron more fully expresses the will of the community.

The criticism of "excessive design" does not stop at the front end, but at the design of the "initial token exchange", "rewards module", "community fund" and so on.

**This shows the DFINITY Foundation's consistent attitude of guiding the development of applications in a strong manner.**

It is mind-boggling that the token standard related system includes a launchpad. Why does this application-level item need to be part of a basic system feature? And as a necessary part of the sns?

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:14616"]
We have this nagging suspicion that the IC community sometimes speaks as if the SNS codebase is rather closed and prohibits innovation. But the SNS code is public so developers can learn from it, fork it, and build according to other needs. If we created this perception, then we need to rectify it. Did we imply or say in our communication that people should not be forking the code? Is the problem that it is feasible, but too painful to do this? **We want to learn so we can improve.**
[/quote]

Another excessive point is that developers must first propose to NNS, and only after the proposal is approved can they use the initial token exchange function of SNS, thus deploying tokens in the dedicated subnet of SNS and enjoying the security of the dedicated subnet.

Otherwise, developers can only deploy their own tokens and DAO in the application subnet and endure lower security.

Most of the above discussion is from the developer's point of view, but we have never thought in terms of community users. The community of ordinary users will only accept messages from the official (DFINITY foundation), and the official recommendation of roadmap and SNS makes users only dare to accept tokens under SNS guarantee.

In other words, even if the developers themselves use the SNS source code to deploy a set of their own tokens and DAO contracts in the application subnet, the community users do not dare to trade these tokens, they will think that these tokens are "not certified", the community will only pay attention to those certified token.

Therefore, "anyone can pass the source code of SNS is not their DAO" is a nice but useless slogan, in fact developers are still put in a very awkward situation. 

NNS vote actually put a heavy tax on developers, who must owe the ICP a huge whale.

So what can developers do? Please give developers some reasons to persist.

I have always been a big supporter of IC and they have done a lot of great work in the past. But unfortunately, since launch, the IC ecosystem has been really slow to grow, and one of the reasons is that DFINITY have been too forceful in prescribing what developers should do, rather than encouraging them to create.

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:14616"]
1. **We think the perception here is understandable (we created it!), but not quite right** - many projects that people think DFINITY is working on are a tiny minority compared to cryptography or distributed systems work. As stated at the latest global R&D meeting, we will provide more frequent updates on the roadmap and hopefully in a format that gives better insight in what the teams are working on in what order of priority, but here are some numbers on the number of [people and priorities from July 2022 ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/update-on-the-ic-roadmap-july-2022-summary/14615):

![](upload://6YruTWsXdNyLF4NG2Ma0k2JsXnS)

* Note that items with a heart symbol are by request from the community and that priorities may change depending on input from the community and shifts in the blockchain market conditions.
[/quote]

Obviously, part of the development of the roadmap will be decided internally by the foundation and part of it would seek the community's input. Therefore DFINITY chose to produce all 25 options at once and let the community vote on them to gather feedback.

But, embarrassingly, these votes were meaningless and more like a "decentralized" political show. Launching 25 proposals at once only tells the community what the IC can achieve in the future, not a roadmap, because there is no mention in the proposals of the time and cost needed to get there, or the benefits. Also NNS cannot determine the order of priority for each of the roadmap options.

The DFINITY Foundation shouted 25 slogans but had no actual plan. In the eyes of the general governance of the community, every proposal is of course good for IC and they will inevitably vote to adopt it. But what the community really needs is a roadmap for "when we should do the right thing".

At the same time, the community is completely unaware of how these proposals are being implemented with DFINITY Foundation, which is very opaque. For example, why did the DFINITY Foundation implement the People's Party first, instead of developing a token standard for the DeFi model, when the proposals were all adopted at the same time? Why did DFINITY suddenly abandon the development of the People's Party and invest in the BTC integration? Why did you suddenly delay the development of "BTC integration" and implement "SNS" instead? Why didn't you let the community decide the priority at the beginning? Who is responsible for the waste of resources and time in the middle?

The community did not know about this, the Foundation made the decision and invested the resources on its own. The foundation also did not tell the community the reasons for making this decision. The community was simply informed, "Now we plan to devote major effort to xx, so we are delaying xx." This is where the community felt they were not being respected and that the governance of NNS was almost null and void.

I think it's okay to be properly centralized early on in a project to accelerate growth. In fact many protocol foundations have been successful this way. But DFINITY only tells the community what we will do, but there is no actual plan.

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:14616"]
When we hear folks say “*SNS design is too rigid. It does not work for my use case”*, we usually think two things:

1. “*Yes, we can always add more flexibility post-launch. Why do people think the SNS will not change?*”
2. “*The code is public. Folks can launch their own versions suited to their needs.*”

**That is why we are looking for ways to understand the community more here.** Also, while building this first version of the SNS, we were constantly talking to teams that aim to use the SNS to ensure a product-market fit.
[/quote]

The problems with SNS actually reveal the principle mistakes made by DFINITY Foundation in making the underlying design. That is, the infrastructure should be kept pure, and should not dictate to the application layer, and should not increase the cost of developers.

As you can see, much of the system layer design of IC leaves no space for future developers, and many possible paths are blocked.

For example, II is indeed a cool technology, but its overly aggressive design at the application layer results in the same identity not being consistent across multiple conisters, which directly results in data not being interoperable.

While data interoperability is basically the cornerstone of Web3, the foundation of IC builds a large number of usable data layers for Web3, but II makes it impossible to connect the data. If DFINITY had designed II to include more optional privacy models, rather than brutally mandating that all users must be in the highest privacy state (deriving a new ID for each conister visited), developers wouldn't be as embarrassed as they are now.

Examples of this also appear in the initial token exchange for SNS (why not let the community make its own LaunchPad?), the community fund embedded in NNS (why not let the community implement its own Venture DAO?), and many other details.

DFINITY should focus more on what developers really need, rather than trying to guide developers on how to implement applications.  Even centralized Apple doesn't limit its eco-developers in this way.

I'm so happy to see this table and get more transparency into how DFINITY is allocating its resources. I want to emphasize that I wanted the community to strongly consider DFINITY's role in things, and getting more transparency was a key point to understanding more. Now that I can see more clearly where the resources are going, I do feel better. It seems there could be up to 20% of resources that I personally feel are misallocated (again, UP TO 20%, probably not a full 20%), but I don't see a deeply existential problem like I feared might have existed here. I do think on a case-by-case basis there are things I think DFINITY should or should not focus on, and I believe a guiding principle should be to focus more on the protocol layer.

**NNS Frontend Dapp and II are more than application level concerns** - NNS and the II authentication are an integral part of the Internet Computer and in particular it is essential that these components be highly secure, that is why it makes sense that the cryptography and security relative strength of DFINITY be invested at making these bulletproof.
[/quote]

I agree that the NNS is quite integral to the IC protocols, though I'm not sure how integral II is. There are other ways to authenticate. I really like the core principles of II and I'm not necessarily saying DFINITY shouldn't have built it or shouldn't continue to improve it, but I'm not sure it's as integral as some think it is. And to be clear, I'm trying to point out that technically and practically speaking, I believe II did not necessarily have to exist. There were other paths, possibly much simpler paths for authentication that would have still worked. Basically something like a MetaMask extension/Plug/or any of the other ways blockchains authenticate themselves.

I agree with you on much of your first two of 3 posts, but not sure I follow this point.

 Users own their data in Web3, not applications. Web3 means users have greater privacy and their direct interactions and data sharing with applications are NOT traced across applications without their consent.

II is pretty brilliant in that it does exactly this, and it is unique to the IC - no other blockchain has a similar solution. 

I therefore don’t believe something like II would have ever been built by anyone other than DFINITY. They have user privacy at the front of mind, and **don’t** have any competing financial interests that could compel them to monetize user data and compromise that privacy.

I for one do not want to be linked across the IC, and that’s why I exclusively use II or solutions based off of II. For those who still want it, the other IC wallets provide a more traditional web2 experience, but they also allow one to be easily traced through a single, unified principal.


@blockpunk Features such as the new alternative origins feature for user login help II achieve what you’re struggling with - allowing users to have a single principal throughout a developer ecosystem, but not outside of that ecosystem.

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:14616"]
**The NNS Frontend dapp development was slow because of migration, not lack of UX skills** - We have seen this pop up a few times and it is also understandable. We agree partially with some of the conclusions, but not for the same reasons. Allow me to explain:
A lot of the *“DFINITY is not good at UX*” perception came from the fact that the NNS Frontend Dapp was sluggish dapp (and it had wonky user experience). It is fair to say that the user experience of the dapp was not great in the months after Genesis and that the foundation possibly wrongly did not prioritize its enhancement enough during that time. However, I do not think the community understood why. There was a perception that DFINITY needed more design help for the dapp. But the truth was that the limiting factor is that the dapp had to be rewritten/re-architected entirely from one framework (Flutter) to another (Svelte) while still functioning as a safe governance and staking mechanism for many, many people. This [migration](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/network-nervous-system-dapp-is-moving-to-svelte/11668) took longer than expected… but once it finished, it became easier to dedicate energy to improving the user experience.
[/quote]

I don't mean any disrespect to any devs/engineers working on the frontend code. My opinion here is based on my own frontend engineering experience.

The fact that the NNS frontend was first written in Flutter was an engineering mistake. The limiting factor as pointed out was that the dapp had to be rewritten. If it had been built from the ground-up using sounder frontend engineering principles (declarative design, component model, standards-based web components, or similar tech) then it would not have had to be rewritten.

And the current SNS frontend from my knowledge will not be based around native, standards-based web components that can be used across nearly all frameworks and libraries for all of the major browsers. These engineering mistakes, IMO, will cost DFINITY and the community as they already have. The II is another example, I've seen the frontend code and it isn't declarative and component-based and doesn't embrace native web components that can be used across nearly all frameworks and libraries.

DFINITY isn't embracing the most sound frontend engineering principles, and even with their rewrites they aren't doing this (to the extent I would like to see). Perhaps my opinion here is very subjective, but it's based on what in my experience have been the most sound principles you can build on top of for frontend engineering.

Basically:
1. Declarative design
2. Component model
3. View as function of state
4. Embrace web components (custom HTML elements in particular)

This would lead to the simplest code, easiest to understand, easiest to compose applications across the community, and the longest-living code (won't have to change because built on standards).

**We agree that NNS Frontend Dapp is not optimized (yet) so that entrepreneurs could ship “NNS frontend Dapp with a different UX”… but more work has happened here than folks may be aware of** - Some entrepreneurs have mentioned that they would like to take the code of something like the NNS Frontend Dapp and modify the UX so they can offer the security/safety of the dapp, but their own UX. This is a worthwhile goal! When I ask folks what is stopping them from doing this, some people tell me the NNS Frontend Dapp is not architected for such clean modularity (“keep the security, change the UX”) other than trivial CSS/HTML changes. ***What folks may not be aware of is that the NNS Frontend Dapp team did create a few libraries for the purpose of making it easy for the dapp to be adopted by others (in particular `nns.js`)***: [GitHub - dfinity/ic-js: Libraries for interfacing with the Internet Computer. ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js) . It is apparent there may not significant attention drawn to these efforts (we should fix this)… but if these efforts do not address people’s intent, let us know so we can iterate.
[/quote]

If the NNS dapp were built from custom HTML elements that were designed to be extremely composable, then many SNSs of various kinds could have easily been built. But it hasn't been designed this way and continues to not be designed this way AFAIK. What's worse is that we'll now have to be under the same domain as the NNS and even get an NNS vote to approve our SNS. I've stopped following the SNS lately, so if I'm out of date please let me know.

It's not the composable system that I hoped to have, where I could pull in the backend and frontend components necessary to build my own solution. Instead I'm being provided a highly permissioned solution that I will feel trapped in. Basically, if I'm even going to use the SNS, I will have to fork. The main purpose of the SNS I felt was to allow people to quickly spin up what they needed, with minimal forking and custom code.

## Where we would like to understand more

When we hear folks say “*SNS design is too rigid. It does not work for my use case”*, we usually think two things:

1. “*Yes, we can always add more flexibility post-launch. Why do people think the SNS will not change?*”
2. “*The code is public. Folks can launch their own versions suited to their needs.*”
[/quote]

I thought one of the main purposes of the SNS was so that we did not have to launch our own versions suited to our needs, the SNS was supposed to provide a DAO-in-a-box.

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:14616"]
We have this nagging suspicion that the IC community sometimes speaks as if the SNS codebase is rather closed and prohibits innovation. But the SNS code is public so developers can learn from it, fork it, and build according to other needs. If we created this perception, then we need to rectify it. Did we imply or say in our communication that people should not be forking the code? Is the problem that it is feasible, but too painful to do this? **We want to learn so we can improve.**
[/quote]

Even if the code is open, if it's not designed in a modular way it will take more work for devs to incorporate it into their dapps. I would like to `cargo install` or `npm install` and have simple well-documented interfaces, relying on the stability of upstream code. I don't want to have to fork and then maintain my own version of the SNS unless I absolutely have to.

Here's the engineering issue I most foresee: the SNS will not be modular, it will not be a set of reusable frontend/backend components with clean API interfaces that I can drop into my applications. Instead, I imagine I will have to fork the core code and modify it to my needs. Foreseeing this, I will probably just develop my own solutions, and sadly I may have to build and encourage others to join me in building the composable building blocks I hoped the SNS to be.

Also, guiding the whole community towards one way of launching a decentralized dapp, especially with the fundraise, seems inappropriate for various reasons, mostly focused around legal. Each dapp is responsible for their own legal compliance, and officially sanctioning one way of fundraising is very strange and I think legally questionable.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-02 16:27:30 UTC | #58

And even given the table of DFINITY resource allocation, in the case of the SNS, I feel too much time has been spent on it. I keep hearing how certain features or issues are blocked by the SNS. IMO it's blocking far too much, and it won't even be the modular solution that I hoped for.

Hopefully I'm wrong about all of this, it's just the feeling I was getting as the SNS continued to move forward, seemed the modular design I had in mind was slowly fading away.

I am not quite sure I follow here. I see these as two very different potential goals in your sentence:

a. DAO-in-a-box to make it easier for people
b. Inhibit/discourage anyone in ecosystem to make a DAO framework by having the DAO-framework for all time

In your mind, do you see as a) and b) linked? For context, I have never thought b) was a potential goal of SNS project based on any communications... but its possible I am misunderstanding or mischaracterizing your sentence.

lastmjs | 2022-08-02 16:38:17 UTC | #61

No b is not what I'm thinking here at all. Instead I was hoping/thinking that the SNS would lift a huge burden off of the community by creating many modular pieces that could be composed into most DAO solutions that we would want, so not necessarily discouraging other DAO solutions, but the idea is not many other DAO solutions would be necessary because the SNS would be so generalized. And the pieces could be formed and pre-packaged into specific DAO tools, by anyone.

And then others could create just the modular pieces that are missing, if the SNS didn't provide them. They could be pushed to `crates.io` or `npm` and downloaded by whoever needs them. Many would be SNS modules built by DFINITY, some would be built by the community.

@diegop Well said by Jordan, but to simplify it just a bit:

Developers expected the SNS to be a set of easy-to-use & modify, modular, plug-and-play **libraries**.

What developers seem to be getting is an easy-to-use, opinionated (hard to customize), end-to-end **product**.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-02 16:54:55 UTC | #63

Ohh nice simplification, I think this captures it.

But also, I don't have a problem with products being offered to us, as long as the libraries are also offered to us. The idea is that anyone can create products out of the libraries.

And the current SNS frontend from my knowledge will not be based around native, standards-based web components that can be used across nearly all frameworks and libraries for all of the major browsers.
[/quote]

Yes and no.

Yes that's correct, the current UI components that are developed for Sns in NNS-dapp are  developed in Svelte.

But no, it is not integrated in a monolyth way.

As I said in my above post, a library called `sns-js` ([repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js)) is developed for the API layer to communicate with Snses.

So while I agree, there isn't currently out of the box UI web components, developers can use this library to interact with Snes - i.e. develop their own UI without having to re-develop the API layer.

In addition, this is the current state. As far as I know the foundation is open to the idea of components for the future as well.

[quote="lastmjs, post:53, topic:14616"]
DFINITY isn’t embracing the most sound frontend engineering principles, and even with their rewrites they aren’t doing this (to the extent I would like to see). Perhaps my opinion here is very subjective, but it’s based on what in my experience have been the most sound principles you can build on top of for frontend engineering.
[/quote]

Of course, here I am biased. Based on my experience, I think the architecture of NNS-dapp fist well a modern frontend architecture. We split the app in various layers (api, services, stores, ui, etc.) and develop libraries (`nns-js`, `sns-js`, etc.) so that the community can reuse the communication layer. In addition we are in the process of extracting all UI components ("design system") to a dedicated lib.

That being said, as for the libraries, NNS-dapp need documentation including architecture. We are aware of this and it's something we aim to improve soon.

p.s.: happy to have a chat about these subjects if you wish

For example, II is indeed a cool technology, but its overly aggressive design at the application layer results in the same identity not being consistent across multiple conisters, which directly results in data not being interoperable.

While data interoperability is basically the cornerstone of Web3, the foundation of IC builds a large number of usable data layers for Web3, but II makes it impossible to connect the data. If DFINITY had designed II to include more optional privacy models, rather than brutally mandating that all users must be in the highest privacy state (deriving a new ID for each conister visited), developers wouldn’t be as embarrassed as they are now.

I agree that the NNS is quite integral to the IC protocols, though I’m not sure how integral II is. There are other ways to authenticate. I really like the core principles of II and I’m not necessarily saying DFINITY shouldn’t have built it or shouldn’t continue to improve it, but I’m not sure it’s as integral as some think it is. And to be clear, I’m trying to point out that technically and practically speaking, I believe II did not necessarily have to exist. There were other paths, possibly much simpler paths for authentication that would have still worked. Basically something like a MetaMask extension/Plug/or any of the other ways blockchains authenticate themselves.
[/quote]

I’m incredibly grateful for the unique properties of Internet Identity compared to potential alternatives, and for what it can enable in things like NFID.

I also appreciate that it was built by DFINITY. By using the NNS I’m already implicitly trusting the foundation so it’s not much more to ask to trust their authentication mechanism as well.

If there were only 3rd party ways to authenticate I probably wouldn’t have felt comfortable without doing a lot of research.

Nothing to stop you from using II in the context of a wallet like Infinity Wallet, to preserve identity across devices. Identity provider != wallet imo.

@lastmjs, I would like to clarify your constructive criticism of Dfinity's front-end work. 

Would you like Dfinity to stop building application level tools or would you like them to build them better? All of your suggestions and recommendations are about how they could have made them better. Or both? Do you not see a world where Dfinity hears customer (dev) feedback such as yours and incorporates it going forward? 

@diegop to the extent this doesn't already happen, I do think it would make sense to incorporate feedback and institute WGs on all application level tools. It seems this happened with the token standard but maybe not as much with II or the NNS. Am I right here?

Good question. We have the following WGs:

1. **Topic: Identity & Auth**
DFINITY lead: @frederikrothenberger

2. **Topic: Developer Tooling**
DFINITY lead: @dfx-json


3. **Topic: Ledger & Tokenization**
DFINITY lead: @mariop 

4. **Topic: Scalability & Performance**

So I think both are true (non controversial) statements:

1. There is an II working group 
2. It’s still early days in WG so more WGs (and deeper collaboration) is an improvement we all agree on
3. Not all WGs listed above would have likely have addressed @lastmjs and others concerns

alejandrade | 2022-08-03 00:20:49 UTC | #72

The NNS UX should have been cleaned up before the SNS was started. Currently the nns looks like a hello world bootstrap project and that’s my personal biggest gripe.

I would also add that dfinity creating products like a SNS in my opinion has slowed down adoption. Everyone in the ecosystem has to wait for the SNS. If the ecosystem would have created a launcher project we would have several and competition would decide which one is best. But in current world people don’t want to compete with dfinity and why would they. Dfinity will use their power to market the sns and competing projects will be looked at as off brand.

I’m not a developer in the ecosystem but as an outsider that’s what I see.


That’s where I think I could see projects complaining

frederikrothenberger | 2022-08-03 09:43:01 UTC | #73

Hi @blockpunk 

I'm working on the II team and I would like to address the points raised here:

[quote="blockpunk, post:49, topic:14616"]

[/quote]

We absolutely do understand that interoperability needs to be improved. And yes, right now II does not support any form of interoperability between services. **But** starting from a strong privacy model and adding _opt-in_ features to relax it is by far the better approach for a sound and sane system than going the other way (which might not even be possible; once you give information away, you cannot get it back).

To address this, we have the following items on our roadmap ([see our roadmap update thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-roadmap-update-august-2022/14657)):
* Delegation of fine-grained permissions
* 3rd party attributes
* Renewable short lived delegations (which is required to do long-term delegations)

Unfortunately, all of those are a) a lot of work and b) pushed back by other items that are required to just keep Internet Identity accessible and working (i.e. II Domain Migration and Multi-Canister Architecture).

Be assured that we want to improve Internet Identity for both users *and* developers.

Also, Internet Identity is open to external contributions. If you want to speed things up and help with the development of one of the issues above please reach out. It would be greatly appreciated. :-)

I guess I've been conflating the two arguments. I think I'm coming to a personal conclusion that I believe DFINITY should have the guiding principle of giving highest priority and focusing most resources on the protocol level, and I believe they are mostly doing that after the recent round of transparency on where resources are allocated. On a case-by-case basis I think app-layer concerns might be appropriate for DFINITY to get involved in. For the SNS, I started off very optimistic but over time have changed my opinion. Now I feel it may be better for DFINITY to not work on it. But if they are, then I would like it to be architected as well as possible so that I can work with it (both working in the codebase if necessary and incorporating it into my own applications).

So, I want to see DFINITY aggresively focus on the protocol layer and prioritize it over anything at the application layer. On a case by case basis, some app layer meddling may be appropriate. Personally, I don't think I'm in favor of DFINITY working on SNS and People Parties, as two examples. If DFINITY wants to pursue them, I'll most likely provide feedback to help them succeed.

Yes, and I feel it somewhat inappropriate for me or other community members to even try to dictate what DFINITY, an independent contributor to the IC, does with their time (besides providing feedback and suggestions). But, there's a conflation with DFINITY and the NNS DAO it seems, and DFINITY has invited us to direct their efforts through governance proposals...

This is probably a good opportunity to perhaps break my “ask only clarifying questions” philosophy for this thread (how many times have I broken it already? 🙃) and be explicit about a tenet I strongly believe:

*“You can tell take the measure of a person by how much truth they are willing to accept”*

This, I believe, applies to teams, organizations, etc… as well. 

Do I accept all the truth before me? Of course not! (I eat less healthy than I’m willing to admit for one), but I think “accepting truth” is a worthwhile goal and a muscle worth exercising. This does not mean that every statement everyone says it’s “truth” but it can mean “it is TRUE that X believes Y.” Sometimes even that level of statements are hard to accept. 

So yes, this is a dialogue and one intended to help the Dfinity foundation ask clarifying questions and ultimately accept truth about what folks believe… I admit, even things like stack ranking of concerns, rationales, likes/dislikes in this thread have all been very helpful so far.

Thank you so far, and I look forward to read more.

As I see ICP as an investor, it has a job of cleaning up after the 2 Cryptos from their problems and selling cycles to websites that have to spend money to build on this new type of system.

ICP, in my opinion, has a totally new internet that is downplayed so as not to offend and doesn’t provide any incentive for new investors. A silent achiever, I think so but they could consider the old internet and what it is worth and where it gets its revenue.

Why not become a new exploria and have revenue come in like some of the biggest tech companies, after all, will ICP be going to recommend sending or searching for websites that are not built on the ICP and are the old explorias going to display websites built on ICP?

I don’t feel the price of ICP, which is just a workhorse for others, will fetch a large price in the future compared to the top coins and unless we have much better fundamentals and revenue stream, real money and backers will not invest.  

How about a wrapper for old sites to come over and do business on the ICP.

Who doesn’t provide rewards today, how about something to view, offer information and services, create a revenue stream but with the ability to market its abilities that others on the old web can’t.

While the only incentive is to sell cycles and invest into the CF and SNS I don’t see much.

I only see views here that should be left upto ICP but lacking ideas that will fund ICP into the future.
