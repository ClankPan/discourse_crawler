It's me who's doing something incorrect or it's not possible to `ic_cdk::print` debug information in `init` and `pre_upgrade` hooks?

I just made an example project.

I can see the print messages in `init` and `post_upgrade`, but not in `pre_upgrade`.

The [spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-imports) said that the `debug_print` system API is available in all three places. There might be something wrong.

Thanks! Following your message I also made another example and got the print message for `init` and `post_upgrade`. Originally also did not noticed any message for `pre_upgrade` but, after applying some changes in the wasm code, stopping and starting again the replica (don't think it was related), I finally got the print for the `pre_upgrade` too.

Print and pre_upgrade are therefore indeed printed, I guess that when I was debugging yesterday the condition met to run those hooks were not met therefore I did not noticed print out.
