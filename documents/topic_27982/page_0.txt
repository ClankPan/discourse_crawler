Anyone else been noticing frequently degraded performance that is also based in the midwest USA area? I'm close to Chicago. But, if I use a VPN and switch to a different location, everything seems fine. It's been pretty random as to when it happens but have noticed it the last couple weeks mostly.

Hey @nolyoi 

RÃ¼diger from the Boundary Node team here. It would be great if you could share some specifics with us to investigate further: When you access a dapp hosted on the IC, open the developer tools in your browser and check some of the requests in the network pane. In particular, the following headers allow us better to understand what is happening: `Request URL`, `Remote Address`, and `X-Request-Id`.

Ok, next time it happens I'll share the data
