and my recovery phrase is not working either. I am 100% that it's correct. I had my ID connected with a Yubico key. But that doesn't light up anymore. Does this mean that I've been hacked and everything's gone? Please help. That was my life's savings.

Hi @Onadrac 

Do you encounter some specific error message?
Are you sure the recovery phrase is still connected to your identity. If you suspect that your identity has been tampered with, you can also use the [Internet Identity archive](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/uc7f6-kaaaa-aaaaq-qaaaa-cai) to look up all changes that have been made.

> But that doesnâ€™t light up anymore.

This could also be a hardware failure. It is good to always have multiple passkeys to account for such events.

You can also consult [our support resources](https://identitysupport.dfinity.org/hc/en-us) for further assistance.
