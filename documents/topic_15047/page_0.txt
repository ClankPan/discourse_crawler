Hi everyone

For security reasons we have updated the service worker to no longer allow redirects as a response to `http_request` ([see specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#http-gateway-interface)).

If you run into issues because your canister needs to redirect, please set status code `200` and the `upgrade` flag on the response to `http_request` and then redirect in the call to `http_request_update`. This will however increase latency of the redirect by approximately 2 seconds.

We are working on a new certification scheme that will again allow redirects using query calls.

Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear.
