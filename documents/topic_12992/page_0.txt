Recent proposal by ysmsm is correct, why is the nns so badly coded and slow? opening voting page creates a new page even, why? 

-Add “Vote for all open” option. Yes it’s lazy but most people do it this way, and most real life voting is already conducted this way (vote all down ballot)

-Make scrolling smooth not insanely choppy like 1990s cpu 

-Remove confirmation/authenticate page from II login, seriously why do i need that when i already entered the web url…. 

add more below, there’s more im forgetting but the NNS is so bad i can’t list all

Also design can use so much work. Take example from your projects https://twitter.com/seermarkets/status/1525777428211277824?s=21&t=To6LH5pRXBQU70We16ZqWg

Ok. Yes   NNS  UI is slow. The use of Flutter was non-optimal. However it is IN PRODUCTION. 

The UI team is making progress....but, making architectural changes(flutter to svelte) IN PRODUCTION is non-trivial and takes time. 

Give credit where credit is due.

I would suggest using the forum search before making new threads on things that have already been addressed.
