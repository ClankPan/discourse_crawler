Need some help. I'm making a mobile app in flutter and I need some help structuring the files. Where do I place my cannisters? BTW this is a typical flutter project structure with solidity contracts in it...

@neeboo can you help here? Is there a starter for [agent_dart](https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart) projects?

Yep. I think you can reference here

FYI, the major difference between Solidity project and IC project, is that in IC, we use agent and candid to communicate with canister. You can check out the example.
