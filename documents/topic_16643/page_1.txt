Hi all,

On behalf of Conic Ventures, I have submitted a proposal for us to become a node provider on the IC. Our goal is to help maximize the decentralization of the network, so we are proposing to deploy nodes in two underrepresented locations, London and Sydney.

We plan to deploy a couple nodes in each location and then gradually increase our presence in both locations. Over time, we expect to deploy up to 15 nodes in London and 25 nodes in Sydney. Our nodes will be hosted at [Latitude.sh](https://www.latitude.sh/) data centers.

Our self-declaration and proof of identity documents can be found on the Wiki: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Conic_Ventures.

The proposal sent to the NNS is found here: [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124554](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124554)

Thank you for your support of this proposal. Also, thank you @SvenF for your assistance throughout this process. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!

Best,
Sebastian

Ajki | 2023-09-19 16:54:28 UTC | #118

It would be beneficial if @dfinity considers halting the addition of new nodes for now. The existing IC "network" has the capacity to support a larger number of dapps and users. 

Introducing more nodes only leads to increased inflation, which is adversely affecting the ICP price. If the price were to decline by another 50%, this inflation could potentially trigger a death spiral. While I support node providers who have already invested in hardware and are in the process, there's an urgent need to address this issue.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-19 17:15:06 UTC | #119

@SvenF 
Unsure if this was overlooked but this needs to be addressed. The company Conic Ventures LLC lists its physical location in its self declaration as 16192 Coastal Highway Lewes, DE 19958. This is the physical address of Harvard Business Services, Inc. This is a Delaware Registered Agent and as such even though they will accept mail for said company it they cannot use the mailing address as their physical location.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-09-19 18:48:58 UTC | #120


Since the death spiral idea appeared on the forum, the number of new nodes is increasing, I don't know why the growth is so fast.

-------------------------

03kalven | 2023-09-19 19:28:43 UTC | #121

Hi @Yeenoghu,

I apologize for the confusion. Yes, Conic Ventures, LLC is registered in Delaware. However, our physical address, as specified by the communications contact (myself) when we registered, is 13 Tokeneke Trail, Darien, CT 06820. Additionally, we have a second mailing address, 206 Elm St, #200869, New Haven, CT 06520. This information will be updated in the Wiki shortly. I hope this clears up your questions!

Best,
Sebastian

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-09-20 03:48:17 UTC | #123

@icper There is a lot of interesting conversation going on in the other threads. It is crucial to understand the NP onboarding process. Since early this year Dffinity planned to work on true decentralization and moved to the Eastern part of the world. With that new NPs were onboarded. It takes around 4 - 5 months for the process to complete. This means half that 4 to 5 months find and ordering vendors to build custom server hardware. This is if the chip shortage remains the same and doesn't get worse. So this is why you're seeing new nodes being added that were intended to be added at least 3 months ago. This is said well in this comment
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/handling-of-node-provider-rewards/23065/33

So basically it takes half a year for Dffinity to scale if there is a surge of usage

Providers and stakeholders,

I have submitted proposal [124823](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124823) to add 2 nodes to a Hurricane Electric datacenter in California, US. This will compliment the existing successful deployment we are building in datacenter ny1 on the east coast. This is at the HE second datacenter, however since it is by the same company in the same city we chose the existing Fremont, CA datacenter. I suspect despite being one entry there are a mix nodes spread between the physical locations. Hopefully future DC proposals will have more accurate coordinates so we can ensure not all nodes in the same region end up in the same building :slight_smile: 

I'm also hoping we won't run into the same issues as George has with his previous proposals.

Thank you for your support,

Cody

SvenF | 2023-09-28 08:15:00 UTC | #133

Hi Cody, @NoviSystems, 

I checked the issue with the proposal from George, it had to do with using the same nodeoperator-id for two different data centers (Tblisi and Vilnius). Every data center should have a different nodeoperator-id. For the proposal 124823 the same nodeoperator-id as the existing ny2 data center is used, so this proposal will not get executed. Can you resubmit the proposal with a new nodeoperator-id?

In the meantime, I will update the onboarding wiki to be more clear on this.

Hi SvenF
We are trying to set up nodes now. 
Before that we want to run some nodes for testing to ensure the details in the process. 
Currently it is Gen-2 node, right? 
Should we refer to below link? 
`https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Deployment_Guide`

And any more kind reminder for the next node setup for us?
Sorry I cannot get a timely feedback in ICP community of Element so that I have to post it here. 

Thanks, Lisa

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-10-04 12:23:48 UTC | #137

hi @Lisa_Crato,
The currently used specification for Node Hardware is indeed Gen-2. You can find the specifications here: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Machine_Hardware_Guide. They include specific hardware configuration that are validated by either the Dfinity team or any of the other node providers. Based on these Gen-2 specs you can indeed use the Node_Deployment_Guide from the wiki. 
Hope this helps.

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-10-05 13:35:05 UTC | #138

Thanks Svenf
The information here and confirmation on Element are helpful.
One more quick quesiton: I noticed that there is also Gen-2.3 Generic specification in wiki. 
Can I use a second-hand machine with such conig to test the whole process first? 
Or I have to puchase the new one immediately so that it can be deployed sucessfully? 

Lisa

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-10-05 15:58:02 UTC | #139

Hi @Lisa_Crato Gen 2 and Gen2.3 is the same, agree that the terminology might be somewhat confusing. You can use a new or second-hand machine as long as it conforms the general specification, but since if it is not a validate configuration there is always a risk that you encounter hardware specific issues that you might need to resolve.

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-10-06 10:54:44 UTC | #140

[/quote]

Thanks SvenF
Got that.
Gen2 is "safer" than Gen2.3 to run IC node since it has been validated by Difinity or community.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-10-06 11:17:46 UTC | #141

Hi @Lisa_Crato, I meant Gen2 and Gen2.3 is actually the same; it's just safer to use a pre-validated configuration, whether second hand or new.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-10-13 12:13:37 UTC | #148

If I remember correctly from my DD on our previous NP's operating in India they registered and operate out of Canada not India. This was likely their workaround to avoid the situation @KrishnaEnterprises is facing.

Not advice on how to proceed. This is just something I remember from DD because the fact the 2 NP's I performed DD on that placed nodes in India operate from Canada stuck out in my mind as strange.

Dear all,

Anonstake would like to proceed with proposal to register a new datacenter as zg1 in Zagreb, Croatia,
Europe. We have submitted Proposal: [125071 - IC Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125071) to add datacenter in Zagreb.

We are an operator of leading blockchain projects providing  infrastructure for staking services. We run our nodes in a privately-owned datacenters. We are already running 12 nodes in Ljubljana, Slovenia and were
one of [the first onboarded in gen2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/20?u=anonstake). We would like to setup 4 nodes in Zagreb in our internal Data Center.

We are currently aiming to setup small amount of nodes in Zagreb, Croatia and next month Austria, Vienna. This way we do not bloat network, add more node machines based on demand meanwhile still contribute to the decentralisation and geographic distribution.

We hope everyone will adopt this proposal and we look forward to any feedback from you in the meantime.

According to the official document, https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration ，if we deploy 10 nodes in South Africa

So our revenue per month is

2748 + 2693 + 2639 + 2586 + 2534 + 2483 + 2434 + 2385 + 2337 + 2291 = 25130

Hello all,

Wishing you all the best - I am writing to formally register as a Node Provider under Privoxy Solutions, LLC. I would like to add (3) nodes in Salt Lake City, Utah USA. I am resubmitting as the summary text of the previous proposal was incorrect.

You can find my new proposal to join the network in the proposal dashboard under Participant Management.

My self-declaration documents are also uploaded to the Internet Computer Wiki under Privoxy Solutions, LLC. Thank you for your support and guidance @SvenF!

Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Additionally, in the future we plan to submit an additional proposal to add additional nodes in Central America when network demand increases in order to support end users in CA & SA regions. I am grateful for your support and votes in favor of accepting my proposal!

Best regards,
Alex

Node Provider Remuneration - Internet Computer Wiki
[/quote]

Hi @mmmzzz, the calculation is correct but this is for a previous remuneration model. As you can see from the [remuneration post](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration), the current remuneration model has a reward of 2310 XDR per month for the first node and a different reduction coefficient (0.95). So the calculation would be 2310 + 2195 + 2085 + 1981 + 1882 + 1787 + 1698 + 1613 + 1533 + 1456

Hello gentlemen!
I would like to be a node provider, I'm very new to this.
I will be glad to receive relevant and understandable information about equipment, technical parts and payment.
The information provided on the site is given in an abstract form, is very vague and does not provide an accurate explanation of what exactly needs to be done.
From whom and where can I find out a plan of action?
What equipment needs to be purchased, how to connect it to the system, what is the payment, etc.?
Thanks in advance for your help.

Dear all,

After successfull proposal becoming node provider ( [Proposal: 123923 - ICP Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123923) ), we would like to add second  Tier 3 datacenter DEAC in Latvia’s capital Riga and name it rg1. You can find this proposal here : https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125526 . This would be second datacenter added in Baltic states and would help greatly for better coverage of Europe’s ICP network and keeping with the plan to populate Baltic states with ICP infrastructure.

If you have any questions or suggestions don’t hesitate to reply under this thread.

Lisa_Crato | 2023-11-07 12:12:30 UTC | #168

Hi SvenF

Me again!
One questioin: 
Should we test the whole setup process in physical machine in China first and then deploy the complete process in HK for formal kickoff according to the matchable geo list. 
From my understanding, it is not forbidden to run ICP node in China but just have no reward. 

Thanks
Lisa

Hi @Kate_H from what I see from the proposal https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125548 there were not enough votes to get the proposal in, probably because it expired in the weekend and not enough people were present to vote on the proposal. If you resubmit today, the proposal will expire on Friday and enough people should be present to vote on it. I do not see any issues with the proposal itself.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-14 11:37:13 UTC | #186

Hi @kennethwwu, I see you are already registered as a node provider, so it is not necessary to submit another NP proposal as you can use your existing NP entity. Unless you want to move your existing node under the new NP entity as well. Could you please clarify?

-------------------------

zenithcode | 2023-11-14 12:54:52 UTC | #187

Hi @SvenF, yes we are GEN1 node provider and it is good to know we dont have to create a new NP. Could u share the link or docs how we can onboard new data center and GEN2 nodes with GEN1 setup?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-14 14:51:10 UTC | #189

Hi @kennethwwu the instructions for onboarding Gen2 nodes can be found. Since you are already a NP no new Node Provider proposal is necessary, the steps to follow are the Data Center proposal, Node Operator Proposal, and the set-up instructions for Gen2. Note that Gen2 node machines have a different setup than Gen1 node machines, there is no such thing as a "Gen2 node with a Gen1 setup", see the hardware specifications, network setup and onboarding instructions that are part of the wiki.

hi SvenF

We have created the proposal of node operator for our ICP nodes setup in HK.

let me know if there is any question.
Thanks!

kennethwwu | 2023-11-14 15:32:40 UTC | #191

@SvenF yes, Im trying to follow step 9 and run `ic-admin propose-to-add-or-remove-data-centers` command with `--use-hsm`, however an error pop up

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-14 16:17:18 UTC | #192

Hi @kennethwwu, if you could share the error you are getting, preferably on the NP matrix channel where both Dfinity team and existing Node Providers share technical questions (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Matrix_channel), somebody could have a look at it and hopefully help you out.

-------------------------

kennethwwu | 2023-11-14 16:30:37 UTC | #193

Hi @SvenF, looks like I can add a new DC with our existing NP https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125630,  should I do something to stop new NP proposal https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125606 ?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-14 18:21:52 UTC | #194

Hi @kennethwwu just create a new DC proposal with your existing NP-id. No need to do anything with you new NP proposal.

-------------------------

Kate_H | 2023-11-14 19:59:12 UTC | #195

Hi @SvenF, thank you for your assistance. We're working on the new proposal and encountered an error ( propose_to_add_or_remove_node_provider error: "InsufficientFunds: Neuron doesn't have enough minted stake to submit proposal: 0" ) , Does this mean that my 10 ICP tokens were burned? Do I need to refund more tokens to proceed?  right?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-14 20:15:12 UTC | #196

Hi @Kate_H, yes that's right. If a proposal gets rejected the 10 ICP is burned, so you need another 10 ICP to submit a propposal. For an approved proposal, this 10 ICP gets refunded again.

Hi SvenF

We are setting up some nodes in HK now according to the current rules.
Next we want to build up more in ICP node roadmap, so I get two questions:
1. As you can see, now our entity is located in HK. Can we register different DCs in other regions like Sri Lanka, Japan?
2. As I said, we are very intrested in helping ICP community grow big in Southeast Asia, like Thailand. You also told me in August that the new plan is on the way and I can wait to see the topic brought out by the team. Not sure if I have missed it. 

Thanks, Lisa

AVRVM | 2023-11-27 15:32:23 UTC | #204

Hello Forum Members,

I trust this message reaches you all in good health. I am delighted to present AVRVM AG, a recently established provider of Internet Computer nodes. Our strategic plan involves commencing operations with one "data safe-haven" node located in a secure mountain bunker in Switzerland. This initial step paves the way for the expansion of twelve more nodes, to be donated to twelve non-profit organizations and universities in Switzerland within the next twelve months. Each organization will go through an independent onboarding process and provide a Self Declaration.

Our primary goal, as we collaborate with the ESG-friendly Internet Computer blockchain, is to promote the adoption of this technology within Switzerland.

In the spirit of transparency, our Self-Declaration and Proof of Identity documents are readily accessible through this link: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/AVRVM_AG. Additionally, our official website is hosted at http://www.AVRVM.SWISS.

I express my sincere appreciation to @Jan, @Christopher, @emilio.canessa, @dieter.sommer, @SvenF, and @diegop for their invaluable support and guidance during the onboarding process.

Best regards,

Yevhen Shot
Director

AVRVM AG
Baarerstrasse 141,
6300 Zug, Switzerland

**EDIT**

We have just submitted our [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126117) for adding AVRVM AG as node provider for the Internet Computer.

C12 | 2023-11-19 14:15:10 UTC | #210

Hello everyone! 

This is not a proposal, but I am pleased to finally introduce **Carbon Twelve** (c12.space). 

**Carbon Twelve (C12)** aims to harness the power of the Internet Computer to forge a more sustainable future. We intend to become a catalyst in global decarbonization efforts by providing both a robust web3 infrastructure and decentralized solutions that enable verifiable environmental claims, driving a positive impact on both economy and ecology.

**Sustainability at the Core:** C12 is not just another node provider. Led by an active IC node provider, (*Principle ID: xfvlz-qkgs4-xyeyx-lbke5-aarza-ovi52-wzpxl-3p27l-ov6ki-csxv6-qqe*), we're setting ambitious goals. Our plan? To operate all of our IC nodes on 100% renewable energy. This aligns with our broader vision of a sustainable digital infrastructure, where every bit of data contributes to a greener planet.

**Footprint in Europe and Beyond:** We will begin by deploying nodes across Europe, and then expanding to other less served regions. This strategic expansion not only strengthens the Internet Computer network but also marks a significant stride in regional web3 adoption and technological democratization.

**Verifiable Environmental Impact:** At C12, we understand the importance of accountability in sustainability efforts. That's why we are committed to making our operations and future applications on the Internet Computer feature strong, verifiable environmental claims. This transparency is not just for compliance; it's a core value that drives every decision we make.

**Call to Action:** As we embark on this ambitious path, we invite the community to engage with us, share insights, and be a part of a movement that blends technology with sustainability. Let's build a future where technology and ecology walk hand in hand.

In the coming days, I will post our Self-declaration documents and submit proposals to begin onboarding more nodes. Excited to be part of this community and looking forward to meaningful collaborations and discussions!

SvenF | 2023-11-20 07:25:57 UTC | #212

@Lisa_Crato yes you can (and should) use one node provider principal to register different DCs. And each DC should have a separate node operator-id

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-20 07:31:11 UTC | #213

Hi @Lisa_Crato, regarding your second question, there will be more guidance shortly on how to   verify this, based on forum [post 1](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-series-node-diversification-part-i/23402) and forum [post 2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-node-diversification-part-ii/23553) regarding the target topology.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-20 07:34:36 UTC | #214

Hi @kennethwwu, it seems the proposal was difficult to verify as there was no relation to an existing node provider, only the node provider principal is shown in the proposal. I suggest to resubmit and add a short background that you are proposing to add the data center and that you are an existing Node Provider and want to add additional node machines. I do not foresee any problems with getting that proposal accepted with the additional clarification.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-20 07:39:20 UTC | #215

@Webgame it looks like there where not enough votes because the voting expired during the weekend, so you need to resubmit. I do not see a problem with the update of the node allowance itself.
