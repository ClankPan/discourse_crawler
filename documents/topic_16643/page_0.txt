Dear all,

As part of the further decentralization of the node infrastructure of the IC (see also this separate forum thread: [State of Node decentralization](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/138)) we are working on improving the process of the onboarding of Node Providers (NPs). The objective is to have a fully autonomous onboarding process based on an updated hardware specification (see [Gen2 HW specifications](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_provider_hardware)) which we are currently testing out.

For the autonomous Node Provider onboarding process, it is important for the community to have a way to validate the identity of a future Node Provider. Therefore, we have asked for feedback on the process of self declaration of a Node Provider, which can be followed in this separate forum thread (see [Node Provider Self Declaration](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-for-node-provider-self-declaration/16501) and [Self Declaration Form](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Self-declaration)). This process is still under discussion and based on the feedback of each of you we will refine and update it, and create a formal NNS proposal to be voted upon.

While we are working on the new NP onboarding process, we want to create this new forum thread where we will update you of new NP proposals and the motivation of the Dfinity foundation to vote on these.

We will keep you informed and of course look forward to any feedback from you in the meantime!

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-11-17 11:43:17 UTC | #2

We have received a first proposal from @ritvick  for onboarding as a NP:

* This proposal has been submitted to the NNS for approval (as described in this separate thread: [Proposal to become NP; Rivram Inc](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-become-a-node-provider-rivram-inc/16550).
* On this separate wiki page: [Self Declaration Rivram Inc](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Rivram_Inc) the company registration and the self-declaration form can be found.
* The NNS proposal does not have a verifiable link yet to the documents on the wiki-page, something which we propose in the future to accomplish through adding a hash of the signed documents to the NNS proposal.
* However, since the self-declaration process is not yet finalized and because Rivram provided the same information, the foundation is going to adopt the proposal.
* Note that in the future the foundation will only adopt proposals that follow the fully updated NP onboarding and self-declaration process that the community is going to vote upon soon.

Hi Sven, 

I would also like to apply to be a node-provider. What process should I follow. I have tried to submit pdf to the wiki you suggested but it's in approval phase. I can provide whatever information needed in email in addition to the form.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-11-28 16:22:14 UTC | #4

Thanks @rishi, can you send the pdf to me in direct message? Then I will follow up with you.

As the NNS proposal for Rivram LLC to become a NP has been approved, a new Data Center record has to be created since the nodes are going to be hosted in a Data Center that is not yet registered in the NNS. The creation of the new Data Center record is described in the following proposal: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/94426. As this proposal is part of the onboarding process of Rivram LLC as a new NP, we would like to inform you that the foundation is going to adopt this proposal.

SvenF | 2022-12-02 16:57:26 UTC | #6

Dear all, Grousset Technologie has submitted an NNS proposal to become a Node Provider, following the new NP onboarding process. I would like to inform the community that since the self-declaration for this NNS proposal is not yet completed, the Foundation will reject the current proposal (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/94097). We will reach out to Grousset to follow up on the NP onboarding process and the documentation required to submit any new NNS proposal.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-12-08 17:39:05 UTC | #7

Dear all, 
After the approval of the NP proposal and Data center record for Rivram LLC, the next step in the onboarding process for Rivram as NP is to install and activate the nodes in the Data Center. For the activation of the nodes, Rivram has submitted a proposal to create a node operator record, see: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/95935. Please note that only two nodes will be installed and subsequently added to the node reward tables, the allowance of 28 being the maximum number of nodes in case nodes to be swapped for maintenance purposes. As this proposal is part of the onboarding process of Rivram LLC as a new NP, we would like to inform you that the foundation is going to adopt this proposal.

Dear all, 
InfoObjects has submitted an NNS proposal to become a Node Provider, following the new NP onboarding process, see [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/97369](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/97369). There is unfortunately a broken link in the proposal, so for administrative reasons the Foundation will reject the current proposal, but we are supporting InfoObjects to submit a new proposal. Following the new onboarding process, we will make sure the proposal includes a link to the Forum thread with the background for the onboarding of this new NP, and a SHA-256 hash of the self-declaration of InfoObjects that is uploaded on the internetcomputer wiki, so the community can verify the authenticity of that document. We expect the new proposal to be submitted beginning next week.

-------------------------

rishi | 2022-12-20 18:09:08 UTC | #10

Dear Folks,

I on behalf of InfoObjects have submitted proposal 98092 to become a node provider. We will set up 2 nodes in US California for 2 nodes and one they are stable, we will set up additional nodes in Middle East and India. Please approve the proposal. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-12-20 18:27:33 UTC | #11

What is the legal situation in India regarding data retention, and how does that affect potential IC node providers operating out of India? The stuff in this report sounds frightening:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/india-requires-internet-services-collect-and-store-vast-amount-customer-data

-------------------------

rishi | 2022-12-20 18:33:54 UTC | #12

we are going to iron out any regulatory issues concerns before we set up nodes in India ( assuming this post was in response to my post). India is not the only country in our list where we can set up nodes.  We are a multi-national company HQed in the silicon valley. Without going into confidential details, all I can say is that for our current customers we have secured data lanes between our offices and customers.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-12-23 13:21:32 UTC | #13

Dear all, following up on the message from @rishi, InfoObjects has followed the new process for Node Provider onboarding and submitted a updated Node Provider proposal (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/98092) that includes a link to the self declaration document (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/InfoObjects_Inc), a hash of the document for the community to verify the authenticity of the document and a link to this forum thread. Since the proposal is in line with the further decentralization of the IC-network and having nodes in new geographies, I would like to inform the community that the foundation will support this proposal. 

Next steps for InfoObjects are to submit a proposal for a DC record and a Node Operator record, of which we will update you in this forum thread as well.

-------------------------

rishi | 2023-01-11 19:42:18 UTC | #14

Dear Folks,

Thank you so much for supporting our proposal 98092 to become a node provider. As a next step, I on behalf of InfoObjects have submitted proposal 101687 to add a DC record.  Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2023-01-11 20:47:27 UTC | #15

Hey @rishi - great to see the progress! Just for validation: The data in the proposal indicates that the DC is InfoObjects's private DC, also consistent with the address given in the self-declaration. Correct?

-------------------------

rishi | 2023-01-11 20:59:24 UTC | #16

yes. it's a private data center

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-01-16 19:44:57 UTC | #17

Hi all, 

Rishi has submitted a new proposal for the addition of a new DC record. This is part of InfoObjects becoming a new NP. You can find the proposal here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/102443. Since it is part of the further decentralisation, the foundation will support this proposal. The proposal replaces proposal 98092 that was not yet voted upon by the foundation. 

The proposal will be followed later by a proposal to add a Node Operator Record, for which we will also notify you in this forum thread.

-------------------------

rishi | 2023-01-24 20:12:19 UTC | #18

Thank you so much for supporting our proposal 98092 & 101687 to become a node provider and add a DC record. As a next step, I on behalf of InfoObjects have submitted proposal 103955 to add a node operator record. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.

Dear all,

@Anonstake has submitted NNS proposals to become a new Node Provider (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/104996) and use its internal Data Center (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/104998) for installing these nodes. 

These proposals might be difficult to verify for the community as they do not include the Node Provider self-declaration in the proposal, as well as a description and reference to the company information and the data center information. For this reason the Foundation will reject these two proposals, but we working with @Anonstake to prepare new proposals that contain all the relevant information so the community has the right information to vote on these proposals. We expect these proposals to be submitted in the next week.

-------------------------

Anonstake | 2023-02-14 17:27:11 UTC | #20

Dear all,

Anonstake would now like to proceed with proposal to register an Anonstake datacenter as lj2 in Ljubljana, Slovenia, Europe. We have submitted our self-declaration document for Data Center run by Xenya d.o.o. at [https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Zaboo_d.o.o.](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Zaboo_d.o.o.).  and with SHA-256 hash 
7d3389fb1a80d08f550d25d104587332aa657d1a24b1e2610d9ccb070569f894, in line with the announcement and discussion at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/19?u=anonstake. Special thanks to @SvenF and @garym for preparing and guiding us with onboarding instructions. 
We have submitted https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/107568 to add node provider and https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/107569 to add datacenter. 

We are an operator of leading blockchain projects providing infrastructure for staking services. We are serving as a non-custodial staking-as-a-service for institutions and retail. We maintain high availability clusters using our own datacenter infrastructure with layer0 networking control using dedicated hardware. 

We will run our nodes in a privately-owned datacenter Xenya. At first we would like to setup 10 nodes and in future additional ones, if it turns out a further increase in distribution is required, we can open a datacenter in another location with additional nodes.

We hope everyone will adopt this proposal and we look forward to any feedback from you in the meantime.

dfisher | 2023-02-14 21:54:40 UTC | #21

Hi @SvenF, I think it would be a good idea to have a dashboard for all the information related to Node Provider owners. The community is supposed to verify the KYC info but to my knowledge there’s not a place where one can find all the info. 

What happens if a node provider signs up and then sells their ownership to someone else? We need to have periodic KYC check ins, some checks and balances, and some additional transparency.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-02-15 08:33:11 UTC | #22

@dfisher, that's a great idea yes. I will bring this up as a proposal in our feature planning.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-02-15 08:44:45 UTC | #23

Hi all, just to add to the post of @Anonstake: note that if you click on the self-declaration link in the proposal on the internet computer dashboard, the final "." is not picked up. The full link to the self-declaration is at https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Zaboo_d.o.o. including the final "."

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-02-16 04:03:50 UTC | #24

Thank you. 

And then, for NPs themselves it would be great if there were some kind of login tool to view the health of the servers. To the extent something went wrong, it could show on the dashboard. You could even enable email alerts so folks could be notified. 

Right now I am reliant on Dfinity to tell me when there are issues with my nodes… I’m wondering if there is a future world where this could work without Dfinity’s involvement

-------------------------

roald-av8 | 2023-02-16 11:27:16 UTC | #25

Hi @dfisher, I know there is such a thing underway. Currently, for our nodes we use our own notification tool, based on IC dashboard API. You can find it here: [Node Monitor by aviate labs](https://github.com/aviate-labs/node-monitor)

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-02-17 12:23:48 UTC | #26

Hi @dfisher , to add to @roald-av8 's message: that's indeed a feature that is underway. More info to follow later.

Dear all,

Zondax would now like to proceed with a proposal to register 2 datacenters as zh8 and zh9 in Zurich, Switzerland, Europe.

We have submitted our self-declaration document for the Data Centers run by Green. At https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Zondax_AG and with SHA-256 hash
3aaadcf5fdf84c71c2f13e49a3e3b6512e71abb5d118b43eb5fe2e421767d5b5, in line with the announcement and discussion at New Node Provider Proposals - #19 by @SvenF.
We have submitted the following proposals:

Add node provider: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/112706
Add datacenter zh8:https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/112963
Add datacenter zh9:https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/112964

We plan to install 2 nodes at zh8. We have also registered zh9 as we plan to use this DC in the near future.

We are leaders in research and development in the blockchain space and work for more than 50 of the top-100 blockchain projects. We build solutions to make the blockchain ecosystem more secure. Our team is 100% remote and distributed globally. We already operate on-prem infrastructure and are experienced in both cloud and DC operations.

With respect to ICP, our team has developed and maintains the Ledger Nano app that is used by the community. Moreover, we are currently contributing and providing feedback on the node onboarding process, hoping this will help the overall community.

We plan to run our nodes collocated into Tier3 or Tier4 DCs. In the first stage, we plan to use a couple of privately-owned datacenters (Green) where we already host our infra. We will inform the community about other DCs as we expand into other countries.

The first step is to run TWO Gen2 nodes at zh8 in order to ensure optimal provisioning and tooling on our side. Later on, the plan is to expand into other countries that will contribute to better coverage and distribution.

We hope everyone will adopt this proposal and we look forward to any feedback from you in the meantime

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-18 20:51:55 UTC | #29

Wow glad to see you guys are becoming a node providers. 

When will the ledger device support SNS tokens?

-------------------------

ainhoa-aaa | 2023-03-20 10:25:43 UTC | #30

Hi @dfisher  thank you, we're really happy to keep contributing more into IC community. As per SNS support we have already developed this and it was reviewed by Ledger https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-icp/pull/16

Dear all, just a quick note that the Node Proposal proposal for Zondax ( [Proposal: 112706 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/112706)) has been approved as well as the DC proposal for zh9 [Proposal: 112964 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/112964)). The proposal for zh8 [Proposal: 112963 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/112963)) has been rejected as the zh8 Data Center in Zurich is the same as the current zh5 Data Center in Zurich, so a new proposal will be submitted by Zondax to link their new nodes to the zh5 Data Center. Will keep you informed when this proposal is submitted.

Dear all,

My name is Karel Frank and I would like to proceed with the process to register as a Node Provider. I will start with 6 nodes in South Africa, 6 nodes in Australia and 6 nodes in New Zealand. I am an independent individual and had been supporting the project since 2017. I want to see IC nodes all over the world, and it would be a privilege to be the first node provider in the southern hemisphere.

I have submitted [Proposal: 115658](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/115658) to add my NODE_PROVIDER_PRINCIPAL as node provider.  Proposals to add the specific data centres that I will use will be submitted in the near future.

My self-declaration documents are available at https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Karel_Frank

Special thanks to @SvenF for support and guidance through this process and for reviewing the draft Node Provider Proposals.

Please let me know if there are any questions and I am looking forward to your voting support to adopt this proposal.

Karel Frank

Hi Sven,

Is the current plan still to get the nodes in subnets (~560) to equal the total nodes (~1,000) by the end of the year?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-04-14 07:58:52 UTC | #37

Hi @dfisher, the plan is to slowly increase the number of subnets in parallel to the growth of the use of the IC. There would still be nodes needed to replace existing nodes in a subnet when a node is in maintenance of unhealthy, but that would be a lower percentage.

-------------------------

Hi everyone,

My name is Lukas Helebrandt and I have just submitted https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/119112 to become a Node Provider. 

My self-declaration document and company registration document, together with a link to the chamber of commerce website where the identity can be verified, are on https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Lukas_Helebrandt . sha256 hashes of the pdf files are included in the proposal.

My company is registered in Austria, but I have spent the last 12 years mostly in China and Thailand in various DevOps and SRE roles. I’ve been watching the Internet Computer for quite a while, and the call to expand the nodes network in Asia has resonated with me. I plan to start with several nodes in Thailand, and then either increase the number of nodes there, or continue with more nodes in Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines. Proposals to add data centers will follow.

Just like above, big thanks to @SvenF for reviewing the draft Node Provider Proposals. 

Any questions can be answered here. I am looking forward to your voting support to adopt this proposal, and can't wait to have the first canisters running!

Hi @TonyF, thanks for your question! You do not need a Hong Kong company, but you do require an entity with a self-declaration that the community can validate.

Hello IC people,

Icaria Systems is a new Australian company created specifically to be an IC Node Provider in our region. Our intention is to become a significant provider of node machine infrastructure using Tier 3&4 rated data centres across Australia and New Zealand. We will start with a deployment of 10+ replica nodes in the city of Melbourne, Victoria.

Once established we would also be ready to deploy the upcoming API-boundary nodes and HTTP Gateway service nodes to support access to the IC infrastructure network across the Oceania region.

We have over two decades of commercial experience with building and running virtualised x86 Linux server clusters, co-located at data centres in Sydney and Melbourne. There are many high quality data centre colocation options in Australia; we are currently talking with [NEXTDC](https://www.nextdc.com/) who an independent Australian public company with Tier3+4 data centres across Australia and they utilise undersea cable links to New Zealand, Singapore, San Jose and (via Guam) to Hong Kong and Tokyo for global interconnects.

My discovery of the Internet Computer project was mid last year via many podcasts. Dom's article in October "[Let’s Grow the Internet Computer Network](https://medium.com/dfinity/lets-grow-the-internet-computer-network-why-and-how-and-general-updates-1c8d0770a299)" sounded to me like a call-to-arms to build a small part of this great collective project. Icaria Systems was created to become one of the many node providers upon which the Internet Computer will be built.

So without further a-do, I have submitted this [Node Provider Proposal: 119823](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/119823) and I ask for your vote.

Proposals to add node operator and data centre records will be submitted as soon as colocation agreements have been signed.

With the kind assistance of [@SvenF](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/svenf) a Node Provider Self-Declaration wiki page including Proof of Identity and Company information has been made available for IC community members to read here: [*Icaria Systems Pty Ltd*](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Icaria_Systems_Pty_Ltd)

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have either here or @icarus_icp (twitter).

Dear community, 

I just submitted https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/120149 for Exaion to become a node provider for the Internet Computer. Our identity can be verified on https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Exaion . 

Exaion is the the Web3 Subsidiary of EDF, biggest european electricity supplier and producer. We built our infrastructure for Web3 purposes, as protocol validation and RPC nodes hosting. We will start to deploy up to 15 nodes in Normandie, France and will then deploy RPC nodes in South America, Africa and Oceania. 

A big thanks too @SvenF for all the support. 

I will be happy to answer any of your questions here, looking forward for your support!

Hi Guys
It's super nice to see ICP grow big. I stumbled upon it back in 2021 but for some reason, I was not able to invest. And again I did stumble upon it a few days ago. It must have been a journey for everyone! I want to invest a significant amount in being a node provider in Southeast Asia as there is less. I have access to a Tier 3 certified data center with colocation. The plan is to implement a single node first and grow to 5 by the end of the year. I would love to hear any thoughts before I put a lot of my savings on this. I believe in ICP creating the next generation of the internet.
Cheers
Malith

Hi All,

My name is Ernst Wohlitz, I learned about Dfinity and the Internet Computer in 2021 and found the concept and idea fascinating.
 
I strongly believe in the long-term viability of the internet computer utilizing blockchain and consequently I invested in ICP during the Genesis launch in 2021. I staked my Neurons and enjoy following developments on the R&D sessions and other forums.
 
I spent quite a bit of time investigating how to become a node provider and would like to become a node provider in South Africa. Based on my research I would like to submit a proposal for 12 Nodes based on the generation 2 specs. I investigated a data center very close to my office in Midrand (Africa Data Centre – Samrand DC), which I believe to be suitable. They are a certified level 4 data center.
 
I included the official disclosure reports as well as my self declaration in the node proposal. See link to proposal below.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122528

Thanks to @SvenF for the support and guidance.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

Ernst

Hi everybody ! 

After been accepted as a Node provider, we just submitted the https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122558. Being part of EDF, we cannot put the exact location of our Data centers because of security reasons. We therefore put a geographical area next to our Data Centers. looking forward on running our first nodes.

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-05-22 22:24:07 UTC | #53

I like that, it feels little bit Mission Impossible. Now you just need to convince the IC dashboard devs to add a hover box for your data centre records with a green teletype scroller sayin' "exact location: UNKNOWN"
:wink:

SvenF | 2023-06-01 07:38:05 UTC | #54

Hi all,
MarvelousWeb3 who is currently a NP has submitted a new proposal to update the Node Provider name in the dashboard (see https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122628) as the Node Provider name was not visible. Upon investigating this proved to be an error in the dashboard which already has been corrected. The name is now visible in the dashboard (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/provider/7uioy-xitfw-yqcko-5gpya-3lpsw-dw7zt-dyyyf-wfqif-jvi76-fdbkg-cqe).

As NP names cannot be updated yet via an NNS proposal, proposal 122628 cannot be executed once it is voted in, and since the error has already been corrected in the dashboard I want to inform that proposal 122628 will be rejected for this reason.

Hello SvenF,

I would like to introduce myself briefly. First up i hope you don't find out too much about me on the web as I try to be conscious of the breadcrumbs I leave behind in my engagement with the web. 

I have been involved in IT for many years and am interested in becoming a Node provider. I have a small software development company in Australia called Anypoint Pty Ltd. I have a solid foundation in  many areas of the industry and although an "old Codger" I enjoy reinventing my skill set as new technology emerges. 

I look forward to learning more about this technology.

Kind regards,

Greg Searle

Susan | 2023-08-03 08:15:15 UTC | #75

Hi Sven

My plan is to deploy the servers in the Teraco CT2 data centre.  They guarantee a 99.999% uptime.
There are more details regarding CT2 on Teraco's website, but regarding power, they have the following to say:

POWER
• Utility power provided with as much
infrastructure resilience as possible based on
South African utility provider restrictions.
• Concurrently maintainable designs
with elements of fault tolerance
built into asset levels.
• Resilient diesel backup generators are fuelled
to provide a minimum of 48 hours of back
up fuel under full load design conditions.
• Fuel scrubbers are installed to ensure
fuel quality with periodic fuel sampling
at registered laboratories.
• Power Distribution Unit (PDU)
technology manages power to socket
level within cabinets, in addition to
remote management capabilities.
• Power is supplied in 1.1kVA increments.
Higher power configurations are available.
• Detailed measurement and proactive
notification of power usage are
effected via a secure client portal.
• Reliability studies conducted
with proven track record.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Kind regards
Susan

This is a sincere proposal to apply for a node provider on Internet Computer.

Company Name: Coplus Limited

Company Location: HongKong

Intended Number of Nodes to be provided: 1

Link to the summary of application materials - Identity Proof & Self-Declaration:
`https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/User:Lisa`

To provide more decentralization to IC network, we propose becoming a node provider in it.

Appreciate your time and approval.

If there is any further question, welcome to reach out to me for discussion!

Thanks

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-08-07 14:00:18 UTC | #80

Hi @Lisa_Crato great to hear you are interested in becoming a node provider. Note that as the IC is a decentralized network, it is for the community to review the self-declaration and identity prove, and to vote on your node provider proposal. I do not provide any approvals or rejections. Good luck and if you have any further questions, please post them here so the community can respond to you!

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-08-07 14:02:23 UTC | #81

Hi @Anypoint! Please post the self-declaration and identity-proof on the wiki, and in the subsequent Node provider proposal include the hashes of these documents. The self-declarations can be found here: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Self_Declarations and have a look at other Node Provider Proposals on the public dashboard as example on how to submit your proposal.

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-08-07 14:56:44 UTC | #82

Sure, SvenF. I have also posted my proposal in the community and look forward to their kind review and approval! Cannot wait to contribute. :smile:

-------------------------

Anypoint | 2023-08-08 07:44:29 UTC | #84

Thank you SvenF. I struggled a little with this, I hope the following is correct. 
1. I created an account in the wiki and confirmed email address
2. Created the Anypoint Self Declaration Page https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/ANYPOINT_PTY_LTD 
3. Uploaded the self declaration and proof of identity files with the hashes included. 
4. Added a link to new page onto the [node provider self declaration page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Self_Declarations). 

I note this has now been submitted to a moderator for approval.

Hello all!

I'm Louise, a software engineer at Aviate Labs who also manages Allusion's Nodes in Belgium (AN1, BR1 and BR2).

I'm reaching out to share news about our latest contribution to the IC Wiki that we felt was very much needed!

Recognizing the importance of seamless onboarding for potential NPs, we've created a visual guide with accompanying text, outlining the NP journey step by step. This resource is based on existing wiki materials and insights from the IC Forum and it is aimed at simplifying the process by helping aspiring NPs navigate the information that is currently on the wiki.

I hope this helps!

Best regards,

Louise

P.S. If you have any comments/feedback on how to improve the wiki page, I would be happy to set up a brief call or exchange emails. Your insights will help refine this resource for the next NPs!

Hi All

It has been a while since adding the data centre to the NNS in May 2023.

The first servers are due to be delivered by the end of the month.

Please support proposal [124043](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124043) to add 6 nodes in [sc1](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/center/sc1) on the Sunshine Coast, Australia.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey SvenF 

I am so glad our nns proposal has got the kind approval from IC community.
`https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124024`

Currently we have reached out to 3 data centers in Thailand and still in the final negotiation with them to ensure the qualified DC can provide best service to IC network. 

Therefore, before we make the decision:
1) Should I just wait for a final result to register? 
2) Can I register 3 of them first to expedite the whole process to order machines?

Appreciate your further suggestion!

[quote="Lisa_Crato, post:89, topic:16643"]
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124024
[/quote]

Hi @Lisa_Crato,
As you can see from the wiki page (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) there is currently no country entry for Thailand. With the latest node providers onboarding, there are now over 500 node machines active in 36 subnets, with new node machines in Canada, India, China, South Africa and shortly Australia and Sri Lanka as well. This is sufficient for the running the current load of canisters on every subnet, and for the decentralisation of the subnets (measured in Nakamoto coefficients). Hence there is no plan yet to add any new countries to the remuneration table. 

Work is in progress on a IC Topology Roadmap for the next half year and the next year, with the objective to assess how many node machines and where new node machines are required for further growth and decentralisation of the IC network. Based on that, the topic on what countries to add to the remuneration table will be brought up for discussion on the IC Forum, and subsequently NNS proposals will be made for voting by the community. 

So for now, I suggest to wait for the end of Q3/beginning of Q4 when this topic will be brought up in the forum. Since you seem to be based on Hong Kong (from what I read in your Identity document and Self-declaration), you could already consider setting up a node machine in Hong Kong as it is included in the remuneration table?

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-08-21 14:26:08 UTC | #93

Hey SvenF

Thanks for the valuable information!
Sorry that I didn't notice the details. Just cannot wait to join IC network.
We will contact with one of our HK DC partners for further details, and meanwhile we wonder how to particiate in the topic on what countries to add to the remuneration table at the end of Q3/beginning of Q4. 
When the topic is brought up, we can share our opinions or it needs voting? 
We do have some strong partners in Thailand, which are willing to support IC network if possible.

Thanks again.

Lisa

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-08-21 14:42:39 UTC | #94

Hey @Lisa_Crato,
Great to hear you want to start asap!

For Thailand, definitely interested to have your feedback once we start bringing up the topic. For the remuneration we need proper data points from Data Centers and HW Vendors for the costs in Thailand, as that will determine the level of the remuneration. So if you are already talking and discussing with Data Centers on hosting, rack-space and networking costs, please go ahead and I would love to hear your experience,

Talk soon,
Sven

louisevelayo | 2023-08-23 11:10:18 UTC | #95

Hi @Lisa_Crato ,

I wanted to express my interest in setting up nodes in Bangkok, Thailand, which also happens to be my hometown. I noticed the remark regarding data center and networking costs by @SvenF, and I thought it might be useful to mention that I've already established contacts with data centers and ISPs in Bangkok, and I have some cost estimates available.

If you're open to it, I'd be delighted to have a more in-depth conversation to explore how we might collaborate. I've also sent you a direct message via the forum for further discussion. :slight_smile:

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Louise

Looks like 2 proposals were submitted for the new data center. The first proposal that currently has votes for is proposing the ID as dl1. This already belongs to a Dallas data center owned by Flexential. This proposal should be rejected but i see a lot of votes for already. Just want to point out to everyone the second proposal listing the data center ID as gn1 is the proposal that should be getting approval.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-08-29 11:39:33 UTC | #98

Hi @sagcryptoicp @Yeenoghu thanks for the update, just want to let you know that the first proposal will fail to execute as the NNS checks whether the data center name already exists.

-------------------------

Yeenoghu | 2023-08-30 12:04:27 UTC | #99

Good to know. Noticed the discrepancy while i was voting and wasn't 100% sure how the mechanism worked there so i thought i would pass it along.

Dear all, we are in the process of onboarding our nodes and have noticed a mistake was made in regards to our node operator principal. We therefore are creating two new proposals, one to add a new operator principal (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124343) and one to remove the old operator principal (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124451). We thank the community for their support of these proposals. 

Best regards,
George

Dear All,

I hope this message finds you all in good health. I would like to be a Node Provider for the IC with the entity I registered for this purpose - Wolkboer (Pty) Ltd. I would like to add 6 of nodes in South Africa.

As per the documentation and forum posts, I attempted to add a wiki page with my Proof of Identity and Self-declaration. It has been referred to "moderation". 
 
I am not even sure if I did it correctly.
Does anybody know how long this moderation process takes? 

Best regards
Wolkboer
