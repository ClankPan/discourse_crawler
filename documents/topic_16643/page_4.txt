Just for informational purposes , if  any node providers can tell, what are the costs involved in operating a node ?? Is it possible to get myself to host a node now or not ??

ic.aitubi | 2024-03-22 16:53:37 UTC | #424

This depends on your location but I recommend you starte by reading this [post](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) on node provider remuneration since reward is a function of cost (most commonly reward = cost x 2) so it gives you an indication.

Dear all,

Ferndale International would like to formally register as a Node Provider. We aim to onboard a number of new nodes in the UK and other countries once node onboarding opens up again. We're excited about contributing to the growth of the IC and delivering value to the community.

Ferndale's identity and self-declaration is posted on: `https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Ferndale_International`

We submitted our NNS proposal yesterday:
`https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128800`

We would be more than happy to answer any questions the community would like to table.

Kind regards

Dear community,
We have recently successfully passed steps 1-3 of Milestone 3: Node Provider Onboarding, which included Self-declaration and Proof of Identity
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Aitubi_AG
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Roadmap

We are also aware of and fully supporting the announcement and discussion regarding node [topology](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643) 

With this note we want to announce that we have proceeded to Step 4 of Milestone 3, and submitted our [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128809) for our company Aitubi AG to be added as a node provider.

This step will allow us to proceed to the next Milestone 4, which involves ordering hardware, once the topology would permit new admission of node providers. Our intent is to focus on regions that would support the further geographical decentralization of the internet computer topology, more specifically the Africa and APAC regions.

We hope that our proposal will receive your support and positive vote.

For AITUBI AG
Fabian

Hi guys, this is my first post here. I am a developer by profession, currently involved in HRM, CRM, project management, AI, etc. I am an early crypto adopter from 2012. I invested in the ICP ICO too; I remember we used to get a very little amount over a period of time. So, the thing is, I was currently looking into dApps and Web3, Motoko, etc., trying some brainstorming, etc. But the node validator of ICP got me interested.

I run a few small servers for some of my clients, nothing as big as a data center, but we do have 1 Gbps network speed, inverter, etc. So, I am wondering if I can become a Node Provider. Just help me with this; I read somewhere a country can have 80 nodes or something. I live in India, on the east side, Kolkata. There are various node providers in India, so I was wondering if I submit a proposal, would it get accepted? Can I become an Indian Node Provider, as there are many providing already? Please forgive me for any mistakes. Any help would be appreciated.

-------------------------

louisevelayo | 2024-04-11 08:47:04 UTC | #434

Hi Zokizuan, 

Super great that you're interested to be a node provider!

The general answer - there is nothing to stop you from becoming a node provider. You can submit the proposal and leave it up to the community's vote! 

Currently, there are many individuals/entities (see the posts above) that are registering as node providers with no active nodes yet. This is because the network has reached it's target topology, and so is not accepting nodes to be added yet. But you can still register as a node provider!

> There are various node providers in India, so I was wondering if I submit a proposal, would it get accepted? Can I become an Indian Node Provider, as there are many providing already?

Based on [this](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines#Q.26A), India still has capacity to have more nodes, but then the question is would adding nodes there (when the gates are open again) contribute equally or more to decentralization than if the nodes were added in a country where there are no nodes yet?

What I would suggest is to test out the [topology tool](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines). You can simulate certain scenarios there to give an estimate whether more nodes in India would be a good candidate.

NoviSystems | 2024-06-15 13:52:35 UTC | #435

Hi all,

As discussed in our node provider Matrix channel, I am currently working to relocate an existing node machine (ego73-sreyv-vpdjs-gxxxh-jormr-swyro-toj4x-obghz-sbk32-duwid-dae) from datacenter ny2 to fm1. Please note that both DCs reside in the same geography (US) and this will not alter the target topology. I am not adding any additional nodes.

To facilitate this change, I have submitted the linked proposal to increase my provider allowance by one to allow the node to be onboarded after it's been physically moved. Once onboarded in the new location, I will be submitting additional proposals to adjust the reward configuration to reflect the correct circumstances and remove the old record from the registry.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129097

**Update 6/15/2024**:

I was finally able to get the node machine relocated, however, an error in the above proposal ended up decreasing the node allowance and therefore is preventing onboarding the relocated node. I have submitted another proposal to correct this error. As a reminder, this is just a move and will not alter the topology or node count of the Network.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130404

Thanks,

Cody

Dear Community,

I’m excited to share that I have submitted a Node Operator Proposal to update the amount of nodes in pr1 for [Carbon Twelve](https://c12.space). 

This is an update to my [previously accepted proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126732), and is in-line with the result of the candidate node machine validation topology matrix. The results of the candidate node machine validation and exact configuration run is available on the [C12 Wiki ](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/File:C12_Node_Topology.pdf) with SHA256 hash `fc8e3fdfd94f7a5c0a9a884fe949f44e206421fa47ac2844c69ba9c5658d57d2`.

* [Proposal 129395 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129395) is to add 4 nodes in the pr1 data center.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you @katiep and @SvenF for your assistance and support.

With feedback from @SvenF, I've come to realize I should be using the update_node_operator command instead. Therefore, I have submitted a new proposal to update the node allowance for Carbon Twelve, which can be seen here: 

* [Proposal 129410](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129410)

Hi all,

Conic Ventures has onboarded two node machines in London and we are requesting the rewards to be set for these nodes in proposal [129419](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129419). These two machines were previously allocated by the community in a [previous proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126893). We expect to onboard our other two node machines in Sydney shortly, and we'll have a separate governance proposal for that process.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for your support!

Dear Community,

***Third times a charm?***

My previously submitted proposal [seen above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/437), had the wrong node operator ID.

With feedback from @SvenF, I’ve resolved this issue and submitted [**Proposal 129634**](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129634) to adjust the node allowance 4 to nodes in the PR1 data center.

As mentioned, this is an update to my [previously accepted proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126732), and is in-line with the result of the candidate node machine validation topology matrix.

Dear all,

We would like to proceed with proposal to enable rewards for Zagreb datacenter ( *EDIT*: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130325) in accordance we published our [invoices](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/File:Anonstake_Invoice_proof_of_order.pdf) dating back to previous year and as seen in proposal published above https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/151?u=anonstake we have established a datacenter in Zagreb prior to topology being reached and run nodes with active subnet.
We however have not received any rewards because we did not submit proposal to set rewards for nodes in Zagreb.

We hope everyone will adopt this proposal and we look forward to any feedback from you in the meantime.

Hi ICP Community :wave:,

Some of you may already know me from my previous posts in this thread, other threads or from meeting me at the NP ICP Lab in May.

I am happy to say that I’m finally making a post in this thread for its intended purpose :sweat_smile: - I’m announcing my intention to become a Node Provider!

I know the IC is currently at its target topology, but I want to start on whatever steps I can in the meantime. 

This proposal will also serve as a test for a new UI I built for node provider proposals, which is a minor extension to @peterparker's awesome project: [proposals.network](https://proposals.network/) :sparkles:.

When the topology allows for more nodes to onboard onto the network, I’m keen on setting up nodes in Thailand, the Philippines, or New Zealand, as these areas currently have few or no nodes planned.

I’ll update this thread when the proposal is up for voting, probably later this week.

Thank you all!

Kind regards,
Louise

Hello,

My name is Anton Verigin, and I am representing AiNodes. We provide reliable nodes and efficient staking services for enterprises and Web3 users.

We are interested in proposing our services as a node provider for ICP.

Given that our business model is unique and offers a distinct approach, we would appreciate the opportunity to have a preliminary discussion with a representative from the ICP team. 

This discussion will allow us to better understand the project’s current needs and evaluate the applicability of our business model to the Internet Computer before we present our proposal to the community.

Could we schedule a call to discuss this in detail?

Best regards,
Anton Verigin, BDM, AiNodes.

-------------------------

Anton | 2024-07-11 10:22:17 UTC | #450

Hello @SvenF !

Can we discuss the proposal before publishing it? The main idea is to provide significant marketing support from our side along with setting up a node in exchange for delegating tokens to our node.

Thanks.

NoviSystems | 2024-07-12 11:37:26 UTC | #451

Hi all,

I have two active proposals that are part of relocating an existing node from one DC (ny2) to another DC (fm1) that we already have nodes in. Some background information is available in [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/435) forum post.

Part of the relocation process means removing the old node and registering a new one under the new DC with a new node ID. Therefore, I've submitted proposal [131048](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131048) to remove rewarding the old, inactive node. I have also submitted proposal [131011](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131011) to begin rewarding the new node. These two proposals will correct the NNS reward schedule to accurately reflect our present situation.

I would appreciate your support in getting these two proposals passed. If you have any questions about either, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,

Cody

A question about proposals [131400](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131400)-131408 (subnet management). These mention that Data Centre mu1 (q.beyond in Munich) is to be decommissioned.

SvenF | 2024-07-30 08:31:43 UTC | #455

@timk11, DFINITY was contacted directly by the node provider (Staking Facilities) informing they prepare to decommission their nodes in the Munich data center as a business decision. There is not have any further information and the proposals are simply maintenance proposals to move the nodes that are active in a subnet out of the subnet and replace these with node machines from other node providers, in preparation of this decommissioning. There are some proposals remaining to be voted on (131411, 131413, 131414, 131417 and 131422 to 29) as not all proposals could be submitted at the same time.

Hey @SvenF now that the community is being invited to apply for grants to review the Participant Management and Node Admin proposal topics, how will information like this be made public so it can be taken into consideration during reviews?  Do you consider this information relevant?  I guess ideally it would have been posted publicly by the node provider.  I'm curious about your thoughts since the CodeGov team and others are now trying to gear up to perform these review properly.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-07-30 14:40:50 UTC | #458

Agree @wpb I think it is relevant information, in the future this needs to be communicated by the node provider on the forum, so that the community is able to review these proposals.

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-10 14:04:01 UTC | #459

Hi Sven,

In relation to proposal [131704](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131704), which proposes to replace a node in subnet lhg73 in order to improve subnet decentralisation, are you (or anyone else at Dfinity) able to give a bit a more detail as to how removing this node will achieve this?

I ran the [decentralization](https://github.com/StephanusFischer/decentralization) tool but there's a great deal of information to sift through in the output, which is probably beyond the time that most proposal voters would be able to devote to this task. In the csv output I can see that there are 5 node machines in Estonia, 3 of which are assigned to a subnet (3 different ones) but I'm not sure if these are the details being considered or how this fits in with or goes against the target topology.

Also the same query for proposal [131705](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131705).

I've posted comments [here](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/19625648570830622662772248501612437419/42/1?open=true) and [here](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/19625648570830622662772248501612437419/43/1?open=true) in the CodeGov OpenChat channel for the subnet management topic.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-11 18:15:59 UTC | #460

**Great points @timk11!** I share you concerns :heart_on_fire: I think it's clear that this proposal reduces subnet decentralisation, both in terms of localised geographic disaster resilience, and collusion resistance (due to a reduction in overarching juristiction diversity - EU). [I've rendered a map to illustrate this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-lhg73-application/34055/2).

Dear Community,

I have recently onboarded 4 new Gen 2 nodes in es1 data center in Barcelona. 

I was granted allowances for these nodes last fall from the results of the Node Topology Optimizer. The results of the candidate node machine validation and exact configuration run is available on the [C12 Wiki ](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/File:C12_Node_Topology.pdf) with SHA256 hash `fc8e3fdfd94f7a5c0a9a884fe949f44e206421fa47ac2844c69ba9c5658d57d2`.

Additionally, here is [Proposal 126733 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126733) from last December where I proposed to add these 4 nodes in the es1 data center.

I have now submitted a new proposal to set the rewards for these four nodes. [**Proposal 131714** ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131714) sets the rewards for the following nodes:

```
     * uao44-6xaz7-xmjyv-wxzqn-fawuf-hpz34-d7ea4-2ft3d-znzye-k246e-cqe

Hi @timk11 thanks. To clarify, decentralization coefficients are currently calculated by country, node provider, data center, and data center provider. So swapping a node machine from, for example, Colombia to Germany does not improve or reduce the decentralization coefficients if there is not already a node machine in the subnet in Germany. Most of the time, the node replacement proposals are for two reasons:

* a node is degraded or dead, so it is replaced by another node from another (or the same) node provider, allowing the node provider to redeploy the node.
* a node is removed in order to allow regular maintenance.

I noticed as well that both proposal [131704 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131704) and proposal [131705](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131705), are replacing a node that is currently downgraded or dead. The other node in 131704 (in Estonia) and in 131705 (in Florida) currently show healthy. The reasons for swapping a second node machine is that in the currently implementation of the DRE tooling, node machines are always swapped in a pair of 2 nodes. 

The reason for this is that with a subnet of 13 node machines, it is always safe to replace 2 nodes without compromising the subnet, while at the same time in almost all cases - when there is only one unhealthy node to replace - a second node can be found that improves the decentralization. But in the case of 131704 and 131705, it could not found a further optimization; in that particular situation, the second node to replaced is chosen at random from available nodes, that at least does not decentralization coefficients. In the case of 131704 and 131705 these were nodes in Switzerland and Germany, which at least did not make decentralization coefficients worse. In the case of [131703](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131703) as another example, the second node chosen was the same as the node that was already in the subnet, so no second node machine was swapped. 

Agree that this is not perfect, and the tooling could be further improved, amongst others to take into account geographical areas such as "EU". This might be a topic that needs to be discussed further, and whether additional decentralization coefficients needs to be added upon and implemented.

Furthermore, the summary text in the proposal that is automatically generated and says "improving decentralization", should actually be "optimizing decentralization", because sometimes no improvement can be made. 

As for the two proposals, these were rejected by the Foundation, but for another reason: the nodes added nodes from a data center in Munich (MU1) that is being decomissioned, as discussed above.

Thanks again for reviewing of these proposals, it will definitely help improving the quality of the proposals and the decentralization of review of these proposals. At the same time we will be working on improving the auditability of each of these proposals.

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-12 14:15:59 UTC | #463

Thanks @SvenF . That's very helpful indeed, and I've voted to reject these as well. Would it be feasible to add some of this explanation (the first part) to proposals of this type?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-08-12 14:27:49 UTC | #464

Hi @timk11 the summary text is automatically generated, but I will talk with the DRE team on how that can be improved. We definitely need a better description in there.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-08-12 18:12:09 UTC | #465

Thanks for the detailed explanation @SvenF, it's much appreciated. I have some questions if that's okay. 

As you mentioned, there was an example of a single node swap proposed around the same time -> [Proposal: 131703 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131703). Given that this can occur by shear chance (as you explained) I take it this isn't a strong requirement (to swap a pair). Presumably a proposer should have the freedom to remove one of the pair from the proposal (if it doesn't make sense), or in practice do they need to stick with what the tool says?

[quote="SvenF, post:462, topic:16643"]

[/quote]

Presumably the proposer could take it upon themself to modify the proposal text? I wonder if it would be even better to state something like "optimizing for a set of decentralisation coefficients referenced by this Motion proposal -> [Proposal: 125549 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125549)". These coefficients don't appear to include some important information, such as geographical distance and diversity of continents (and/or overarching jurisdictions). It seems it would be possible to optimise for the existing coefficients while actually achieving a worse decentralisation outcome in real terms. I think [Proposal: 131704](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131704) is an example of this.

Assuming that [Proposal: 131704](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131704) didn't feature the MU1 data center issue, can I ask if you think it would have been a good proposal to accept (under the terms of "optimizing *decentralization*")?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-08-13 07:37:00 UTC | #466

Hi @Lorimer if the proposal would not have included the MU1 nodes, I think yes, the proposal would be okay if it stated "optimizing decentralization" instead of "improving decentralization". Then again, I will talk to the team and see how the summary descriptions can be improved. Adding new decentralization coefficients such as a political region and taking these into account when selecting node machines for a subnet will of course require some more discussion and time to implement.

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-13 13:26:12 UTC | #467

Hi Marc,

Great work on getting the new nodes onboarded! I'm just going over the proposal details as part of the CodeGov team's review process and have a question about the node machine validation documents.

The hash you've given doesn't seem to correspond to the current document in the [Wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/File:C12_Node_Topology.pdf). Instead, it appears to match the earlier (15 Dec 2023) document on this page.

In the current document, you've given an initial Objective Value of 20, and shown that adding the 4 nodes at data centre Paris 1 would lower the Objective Value to 17, and adding 4 nodes at data centre Barcelona 1 would lower the Objective Value to 16, matching the text shown on pages 3, 5, 8, 12, 14 and 17 of the document, and thereby improving network decentralisation in both cases.

In the earlier document, you've given an initial Objective Value of 13, and stated that adding 3 nodes at data centre Paris 1 would lower it to 10, and adding 4 nodes at data centre Barcelona 1 would lower it to 6, however the same values of 17 and 16 as per the current document are shown in the graphical output in this document.

My guess is that the current document is probably the one for which the hash should have been given, as opposed to the earlier document. Would this interpretation be correct? My question is probably academic as the node allowances have already been approved in last year's proposal, the current Wiki document supports this, and I see no reason to vote against the new proposal, but I'd like to check if I've misunderstood or overlooked anything.

-------------------------

C12 | 2024-08-13 14:01:09 UTC | #468

Hey Tim, thanks for your diligent review! Yes, I believe you're interpreting everything correctly, and apologies if theres some inconsistencies with the hash. 

If I remember correctly, I experienced some troubles uploading documents to my Wiki around the time that the Topology Optimizer was introduced. 

You can see comments between @SvenF and myself about this around Dec 2023 [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/266?u=c12) and [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/271?u=c12).

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything from me.

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-13 15:17:37 UTC | #469

Thanks Marc. That all sounds fine and clears things up. It also helps to reassure me that I'm following all this properly, so that's much appreciated too!

[/quote]

Thanks @SvenF, what if there were a competing proposal submitted shortly after by a member of the community that produces a clearly more robust decentralisation outcome (satisfying the current coeffcients, as well as addtional ones that are intuitively important). Would DFINITY take kindly to such a proposal (rejecting the original proposal in favour of the community-member-proposed one), or would this be discouraged?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-08-16 07:27:51 UTC | #471

Hi @Lorimer that's for the community to decide, and not for the foundation. If there is a proposal that has valid arguments to further optimize decentralization, than that would definitely be something that the community would be interested in.

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-17 01:26:14 UTC | #472

Hi Marc,

Congratulations on getting this proposal passed! Just for your info, we've posted some reviews of this proposal (along with others for Node Admin and Subnet Management) in **CodeGov**'s OpenChat channel [here](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/261185533762247244401204502467932456179/3).

All the best,

Tim

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-17 02:16:17 UTC | #473

Hi @SvenF . Thanks for taking on board the feedback about adding more detail to subnet management / node replacement proposals. I see that the latest proposal ([131789](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131789)) has a much more thorough explanation about why the change has been proposed.

I'm not sure how to verify the changes however. I've installed the `dre` cli tool just from the instructions [here](https://github.com/dfinity/dre/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md), but what commands or other steps should be used to replicate the result shown in the proposal?

I agree! @sat did a great job of turning this around so quickly!

I'm not the most familiar with the `dre` tool, but there's an [API](https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/swagger) that can be queried for the relevant information (raw data that requires processing to pick out the necessary info).

Here's some proposal details that I've put together -> [Subnet Management - 4zbus (Application) - Developers - Internet Computer Developer Forum (dfinity.org)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-4zbus-application/34056/10)

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-18 04:26:30 UTC | #475

Thanks @Lorimer and thanks @sat! I agree with the questions you've asked in your other post and hopefully the team can give us some further details on these.

I've also voted to adopt the proposal and have posted a review with the reasoning explained in CodeGov's OpenChat channel [here](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/19625648570830622662772248501612437419/44/1?open=true).

@timk11 After [this PR](https://github.com/dfinity/dre/pull/746) is merged, it should be possible to run:
```
dre proposals analyze <open-subnet-membership-change-proposal-number>
```
And this should re-do the decentralization analysis. There is still some polishing that needs to be done, and the documentation that needs to be written. PRs are welcome! :smiley:

Hi Everyone, 
As some of you might be aware, we are in the process of changing our IPv6 subnet due to issues with the Geo IP database. The ISP has assigned us IP addresses that are not recognized as local, even though the latency remains the same. To address this, we've taken steps to acquire our own local IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. As part of this effort, we are redeploying all CM1 DC nodes from scratch. We've successfully migrated two nodes that were not previously in the subnet to our new IP space. Now, we have created two NNS proposals to remove the nodes that are still in the subnet and need to be migrated: 

Proposal 131977 
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131977
Proposal 132102 
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132102

We would greatly appreciate your support in voting on these proposals to expedite the migration process. Thank you!

Hey @MalithHatananchchige.  Is there a reason you posted this information after the proposals were live instead of before the proposals were live?  Now that there are independent reviewers for this proposal topic, it seems desirable to improve the communications on the reasons why these changes are made.  What do you think would be the best way to make the change justification available to proposal reviewers?

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2024-08-23 04:07:44 UTC | #479

The main communication happened in the Elements Matrix Channel for NPs. 
About a few weeks back before we started.
![Screenshot 2024-08-23 at 9.36.19 AM|669x500](upload://2SKC5CdQFvyCR3OFUnVcRqtIAFM.jpeg)

And clearly, there is room for improvement in communication. Forum would be a good idea always then

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2024-08-23 04:16:41 UTC | #480

Actually, this would be good if there was a different topic on the forum to keep the reviewers in the loop on ongoing node maintenance, as there are many reasons for redeployment. Like hardware failure, ISP issues, or switching to a different ISP, Purchasing your own IP space 

What do you think?

Oh that’s very interesting.  I’m not familiar with that channel.  Is it open to the community and/or reviewers?  Would it be possible for the CodeGov team (@ZackDS @timk11 @LaCosta @wpb @Zane @cyberowl) as well as @lorimer to get access?

Yes, I think the forum is likely the best place for this communication.  I believe it has already been suggested to @lara and @cryptoschindler that a tag for each proposal topic should be created, but separate forum topics could also be used.  Do you think all node providers would be willing to follow a work process that includes adding more information about why changes are proposed?  It seems likely they would be willing, especially if everyone knows that there are independent reviewers in addition to DFINITY who are reviewing the proposals.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2024-08-23 05:14:00 UTC | #482

Even though I can not speak on behalf of all NPs I think they would and I definitely would not mind sharing why a proposal on Node management would happen with the community.
This way we can bridge the gap on any communication issues. Also, I intend to update the wiki on my learnings.(Anyone can update it)

-------------------------

timk11 | 2024-08-23 06:53:42 UTC | #483

Thanks Malith for this info! I've gone on to the NP matrix channel and joined up. The information there certainly gives a clearer context to these two proposals. If NPs can post something on this forum for these sorts of proposals it would be a big help as it's easy to access without having to go through sign-up steps.

Personally I'm in favour of a forum post link being included within any technical NNS proposals, wherever in the forum the post might happen to be. This covers a few other proposal types as well so it might warrant a separate discussion in this forum.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2024-08-23 07:51:35 UTC | #484

Great, I don't think any NP knows that subnet management is under independent review and should be posted on the forum. I don’t mind posting on the forum—the idea that @Lorimer brought up seems to work well. You might need to inform all NPs or encourage this practice. In the meantime, as mentioned, I will update the Wiki to include the correct process for updating subnet forum posts when intending to remove a node for maintenance.

Thanks @MalithHatananchchige! For anyone else reading this, you may find this thread to be a useful collection of subnet-specific Subnet Management proposal forum discussions. -> [Subnet Management - General Discussion - Developers - Internet Computer Developer Forum (dfinity.org)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-management-general-discussion/34091)

Just to confirm, we are internally working on a suggestion how proposal can be shared on the forum, so that it is easy to find all proposal discussions. We will share this in the coming week or so!
