Greetings. I live in Norway & would like to be a node provider. I saw there were no node providers in Scandinavian countries, apart from 1 NP which is in Sweden. I wonder if a node is really needed in Norway given the small population of 5million only? I have to admit that I am a total newbie on this so I have a lot to research and ask community members. But I believe in the Internet Computer Protocol long term vision.

Hello all, 

I've submitted my Self-declaration and Proof of Identity documentation to the IC Wiki, but it says it is pending review from moderation.

Can one of the Mods please assist? CC @SvenF

@SvenF when verifiable credentials come to the IC, we should implement KYC / AML for node providers, and require that they sign up and pay for KYC / AML providers in their local jurisdiction.

Thoughts?

Hi @C12 I have asked the moderators to follow up on this.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-30 08:02:15 UTC | #232

Hi @dfisher that's definitely a topic to be discussed in the future. The complexity will probably be how to set this up in a decentralized way. Do you have any ideas on this?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-30 08:06:53 UTC | #233

Dear all,

In order to improve the decentralization network, an optimization model was proposed on the forum (see [node diversification part 1](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-series-node-diversification-part-i/23402) and [node diversification part 2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-node-diversification-part-ii/23553)) and also approved (see [proposal 125367](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125367)). Given a certain target topology, the model optimizes between node rewards (onboarding of additional new nodes and rewards for existing nodes) and decentralization, calculating the minimum number of additional node machines required in order to achieve specific decentralization targets. The basis for the optimization model is a target IC topology for the next 6 to 12 months that was approved by the community in[ proposal 125549](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125549) on 12th November 2023. This model sets targets for the number of Gen1 nodes and Gen2 nodes per subnet, and the decentralization coefficients (Nakamato coefficients) per subnet.

With the optimization model and target topology, there is an objective tool for the community to validate whether additional node machines add to the decentralization of the IC network, which is reproducible as well by other members in the community.

The Node Provider wiki page has been updated to include the steps for candidate node validation as part of the node onboarding process, and how to include the outcome of the validation process in the Node Operator Record. Please find the detailed description of the validation process on https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines. The node candidate validation will be part of the submission of the Node Operator record, as described on https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding.

As always, please share any additions, updates and comments for discussion on this forum thread and/or wiki pages.

origingame | 2023-11-30 09:56:04 UTC | #235

Hi @SvenF  
I hope this message finds you well. I have some questions regarding the Version 2.1 Remuneration Model:

1. About the reduction of coefficient:
   - Once the limit of 50 nodes is exceeded, how much will the coefficient actually be reduced?

2. For additional nodes coefficient:
   - Will the reduction only be applied to additional nodes? For example, the first 50 nodes will have the initial coefficient, while starting from the 51st node, will the coefficient reduce to a certain level?

Thank you so much for your time and assistance!

Best regards

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-30 10:26:22 UTC | #236

Hi @origingame thanks for your questions. To give a quick response:

1. the limit of nodes per node provider is currently 42 (see the forum posts [node diversification part 1](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-series-node-diversification-part-i/23402) and [node diversification part 2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-node-diversification-part-ii/23553)). So no additional node machines above 42 can be onboarded. In practice this will be much lower as with the optimization tooling (described in the post above) it can be seen that adding only a limited number of node machines per node provider will actually support further decentralization of the IC network. 

1. the reduction coefficient applies to each additional node. See the example on the wiki page on remuneration (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration): reward for Node 1 2748 XDR, reward for Node 2 is 2693, reward for Node 3 is 2639, and so on.

-------------------------

kennethwwu | 2023-11-30 12:31:06 UTC | #237

Hi @SvenF regarding to point 2, does the reduction coefficient apply to each additional node per Generation, or each additional node per Node Provider? for instance, I have 10 GEN1 nodes, if I want to add 1 more GEN2 node, when we calculate rewards for this GEN2 node, is it the 11-th node or 1st node? thx

I think "the reduction coefficient r(**np, g** ) is applied per (Node Provider + Country) pair" is still valid, right? so N-th node should be calculated per NP per Country.

-------------------------

AVRVM | 2023-11-30 14:04:45 UTC | #238

@SvenF thanks for the quick reply. When I navigate to my user page (wiki.internetcomputer/wiki/User:CarbonTwelve) the documents are listed there. 

However, they are not viewable on the public page (wiki.internetcomputer/wiki/CarbonTwelve). I assumed this was due to the pending approval from moderation?

Dear All,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to formally register as a Node Provider under the entity, **Carbon Twelve**.

As mentioned in my previous post, Carbon Twelve (C12) is a new entity formed by existing node provider, Marc Johnson, that aims to harness the power of the Internet Computer to forge a more sustainable future.

C12 will be taking over Marc's existing node operations, and will initially scale to 5-10 nodes in Paris, 10-15 nodes in Barcelona, followed by more nodes in new locations in the months ahead.

C12 has been interested in supporting the IC for quite some time, and our primary objective is to facilitate the widespread adoption of the IC. C12 plans to operate all of our nodes on 100% renewable energy. This aligns with our broader vision of sustainable digital infrastructure, where every bit of data contributes to a greener planet.

For some reason, the Forum keeps telling me I cannot add links to my forum posts, however, you can view my new proposal to join the network here - **Proposal 126317**.

For your convenience, I have made C12's self-declaration documents available at the following location: internetcomputer/wiki/CarbonTwelve. You can also find out more about C12 at **c12.space**.

I would like to express my appreciation to @SvenF for his support and guidance throughout this process.

If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Your support and votes to adopt my proposal would be greatly appreciated!

Best regards,
Marc Johnson

Dear All

Eastman Ventures submitted a [Proposal 126329](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126329) to be a Node Provider for the IC. 

My clients introduced me to the IC.  I also would like to deploy 6 nodes in the [Teraco Rondebosch](https://www.teraco.co.za/data-centre-locations/cape-town/) data centre, in Cape Town - South Africa.  This would be a new data centre for the IC. The "objective score" according to the recently published tool with decrease from 71 to 69, thus contribute to the decentralization of the IC.  I will publish more of the decentralization tool results with the Node Operator proposal.

If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Your support and votes to adopt my proposal would be greatly appreciated!

After spending more time on the Decentralization Optimization Python program, it seems that I can only onboard 2 new nodes and not 6 initially planned.  I would therefore start with 2 nodes and expand over time as more nodes are required on the IC.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-06 14:01:48 UTC | #258

Hi @kennethwwu, when I run the latest version of the optimization too, it shows that for IC decentralization less than 10 nodes are required in Melbourne Australia. Can I ask you to rerun the tooling (please make sure to use the latest IC target topology) and then check the outcomes of that?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-06 14:05:03 UTC | #259

Hi @zenithcode great to have you in the community and see your Node Provider proposal. To comment on your intention to set up nodes in India, please make sure to import the latest IC target topology when using the optimization tool, because when running it I see less than 12 node machines might be required for the time being to support decentralization. An `ObjectValue` of 141 means that you probably used the topology status of Sept 2023.

hey @SvenF, thx for getting back to me.
I just pull the latest code and got the `node_pipeline.csv` from yesterday commit, so now Im having `Objective Value: 65.00` with

`node_provider ='Bigger Capital', data_center ='Melbourne 3',data_center_provider ='5G Networks',country = 'AU',is_sev = True,no_nodes = 0` 

in `topology_optimizer/main.py`.

when I updated the `no_nodes = 9` and re-run the programe the Objective Value goes down to 56.00. the value never decreased if I add more number of nodes.

Based on the 1:1 reduction ratio, I think 9 nodes is the number I can add to Melbourne region, is it correct? if that looks good, I will updated the snapshots on my profile page and raise another proposal.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-07 10:58:48 UTC | #264

Hi @kennethwwu , Objective Value 65 looks too high. If you can send a direct message to me with your code (as pdf) then I will have a quick look.

-------------------------

kennethwwu | 2023-12-07 14:04:46 UTC | #265

hey @SvenF, I just direct msg u, I just get fresh clone from repo https://github.com/dfinity/decentralization, and follow README to execute `topology_optimizer/main.py`, even I ran with default "Messi" config the Objective Value is still 65

-------------------------

C12 | 2023-12-07 14:16:35 UTC | #266

Dear All, it seems my proposal to become a new node provider has passed: 
Proposal 126317

I've run the topology_optimizer at github/dfinity/decentralization to get the ObjectValue of the nodes I intend to onboard. The initial Objective Value was 65 and my results are as follows:

* **Paris:**
  * Data center: Paris 1
  * Owner: Celeste
  * Nodes: 5
  * ObjectiveValue: 60

* **Barcelona:**
  * Data center: Barcelona 1
  * Owner: Adam
  * Nodes: 10
  * ObjectiveValue: 56

* **New Zealand:**
  * Data center: Hamilton 1
  * Owner: Datavault
  * Nodes: 14
  * ObjectiveValue: 56

Given the good results, I will now seek to submit a Node Operator Proposal for these nodes. 

@SvenF I would appreciate any feedback.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-07 15:17:10 UTC | #267

Hi @C12, thanks for running the model! Having node machines in new countries and in new data centers definitely helps to reach the target IC topology.

Like I posted above, current objective value seems to be much lower than 65 but there looks to be room to onboard additional node machines. Could you direct msg me with the input that you used? Then we can double check on our side.

-------------------------

C12 | 2023-12-07 15:19:00 UTC | #268

@SvenF my account on this forum seems to have limited permissions. I am not able to direct message you, or post links in my messages. I recently emailed you from m@c12.space, and will follow up with additional information about the results.

ZanderG | 2023-12-08 08:30:53 UTC | #270

@SvenF Can you maybe specify what your lower Objective Value was?

-------------------------

C12 | 2023-12-08 09:02:57 UTC | #271

@SvenF can you confirm you received my follow-up email yesterday with my results of the Topology Optimizer? I sent it from **m@c12.space**

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-08 10:45:49 UTC | #272

Hi @ZanderG, the current `ObjectiveValue` when running the model should be 20. There might sometimes be a small variance when nodes are brought online and offline, as the model now takes the latest status of the nodes in the IC network.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-08 10:47:10 UTC | #273

Hi @c12 yes I have received it, I will respond to you directly but please allow me some time for that.

 Hello, @SvenF 
we are going to add 10 new nodes in KR2. The newly added DC needs to create a new node_operator_id. However, due to my mistake, I did not create a new one and entered the node_operator_id used by the old HK4 DC. What should I do now? Now that I have created a new node_operator_id, do I need to resubmit the proposal to add nodes within the KR2 DC? Or can this wrong node addition be modified? https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126363

Thank you very much

Dear all,
I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your assistance regarding a crucial issue I am currently facing. 

Due to a recent browser update of Chrome, Internet Identity ‘passkeys’ were inadvertently cleared, and unfortunately, I did not make a backup. This has left me unable to access the NNS system at https://nns.ic0.app/

As part of our operations, we have nodes in Hong Kong (hktt4, 7nodes from origingames), and we are in the process of applying for nodes in South Korea (estimated in 10 nodes machines). However, the inability to access the NNS system is causing significant disruption. I am reaching out to inquire if there is a solution or any assistance you can provide to help me regain access.

I can provide proof of ownership through various means, including the Internet Identity associated with the account, the hardware wallet used for interactions with NNS, the node_operator_private_key.pem file, and evidence of ownership for the nodes currently operational online.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and any guidance or support you can provide to help me resolve this issue swiftly.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,
OriginGames team

Hi @Olivia-xiami. With the introduction of the optimization tooling you have to include a validation of candidate nodes (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines) to your node operator proposal. Could you please check with the tooling whether adding 5 nodes in HK will support decentralization, and if so resubmit your proposal?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-10 19:34:20 UTC | #283

HI @Webgame unfortunately a proposal cannot be updated once submitted and when you use the node operator id from the HK data center the proposal will fail to execute even if approved. So you have to resubmit your proposal. You should also add the information from the candidate node validation process in your node operator proposal (in your case that you ordered the machines before 1st Dec). Let me know if any questions.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-10 19:39:39 UTC | #284

Hi @origingame sorry to hear the issue. Can you post your message on the Matrix/Element channel (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Matrix_channel)? That is the best place for discussion technical issues and trouble shooting and includes both dfinity team and community members with technical background.

-------------------------

origingame | 2023-12-11 03:01:32 UTC | #285

Thank you for your prompt response and suggestion. We have already posted our letter on the Matrix/Element channel (Node Provider Matrix channel - Internet Computer Wiki) as per your recommendation. We appreciate your assistance and look forward to any guidance or support the community or the ICP Team can provide to help resolve this issue swiftly.

Best regards,

@SvenF 
Hello, I calculated the model of kr2 data center with 10 nodes.
But I don't understand at all what these X's and picture squares mean. Is there any place that can explain it? Or can you see from this that kr2 can also add 10 nodes?

create_candidate_node_dataframe(node_provider ='web3game',
                                                         data_center ='kr2',
                                                         data_center_provider ='Gasan',
                                                         country = 'KR',
                                                         is_sev = True,
                                                         no_nodes = 10)

SvenF | 2023-12-11 19:32:17 UTC | #288

Hi @Webgame the model is explained in more detail on the forum (see the links in the first paragraph of the wiki page: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines). The X's represent the required node configuration (target topology), the colored boxes are the existing node machines for every node provider. 

The graph with Node Allocation Per Subnet per Country best shows what is required to reach the target topology: the blue boxes are node machines that already exist, the red boxed shows where new Gen2 node machines still are required. It shows that 4 subnets still require Gen2 node machines. And with a node provider limit of 1 this means a new node provider currently can only add a maximum of 4 node machines (if there are not already a lot of node machines of the same country in the subnet). 

Suggest to go through the forum post and have a look at the outcome of the model. It looks like that a maximum of 4 node machines still can be added, but be aware that other node providers are submitting proposals as well.

origingame | 2023-12-12 12:44:19 UTC | #292

Dear SvenF,

Thank you once again for your valuable advice. We have promptly posted our issue on Matrix/Element and received some alternative solutions that might be applicable for recovering the identity.

In line with the guidance provided in 'Changing the Node Provider Principal,' we plan to expeditiously submit a proposal for switching OriginGame's identity, as recommended by Sasa Tomic. Additionally, we will create a post on the forum, linked to the proposal, allowing our community members to pose questions regarding this incident. This approach aims to foster transparency, build trust, and garner support for the proposed changes.

We sincerely appreciate your time and assistance.

Best regards,

geeta23 | 2023-12-13 17:00:12 UTC | #293

Dear all,

I would like to formally register as Node Provider. I plan to onboard a limited number of new nodes in countries where there are currently no IC nodes present, in line with the IC decentralisation topology. I look forward to contributing to the further decentralisation of the IC node network and to support the future growth of the IC.

My self declaration documents can be found here: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Geeta_Kalwani

If you have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Your support and votes to adopt this proposal would be greatly appreciated: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126403.

Best wishes,

Geeta

Hello, @SvenF 
We had purchased an order for 10 servers in November before the decentralized node proposal was implemented. What should we do in this situation?

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-12-14 03:04:08 UTC | #295

@Webgame did you guys have the Node allocation proposal for the 10 nodes accepted before the 1st of December?

-------------------------

Webgame | 2023-12-14 03:11:15 UTC | #296

At that time, no node application proposal had been submitted.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-12-14 03:18:36 UTC | #297

I see, if you had a node allocation approval for the 10 nodes before the 1st of December you can follow this guide.
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Adding_additional_node_machines_to_existing_Node_Allowance

but since it's not, unfortunately, you have to submit the new proposal with node validation proof that it helps decentralization. If the servers are yet to arrive, I'm guessing you can add nodes over time when the decentralization script approves it. There was a topic on the wiki on when to order servers, it usually is after the node allocation proposal is accepted. 

I know it won't solve your problem but hope this info will help you decide how to tackle it

-------------------------

Webgame | 2023-12-14 03:34:11 UTC | #298

OK, I got it, thank you very much for your answer.
Currently, only 4 servers can be added first. Decentralized computing only allows 4 servers to be added.

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-12-14 03:58:04 UTC | #299

It's best to talk with Sven to. As there are proposals for node allocation for people who ordered before, example this 

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126482

So I think there is still hope, not sure though since its a new proposal

-------------------------

Webgame | 2023-12-14 03:48:42 UTC | #300

Okay, thank you for your suggestion, I will refer to it
Because our servers need to be couriered from one country to another (during which they will go through customs inspection, which is quite time-consuming), and we observed that there are not many nodes in the kr country, we ordered the servers in advance.

-------------------------

C12 | 2023-12-14 11:06:03 UTC | #301

Hi All,

I'm preparing to submit new Node Operator proposals and have recently updated the [C12 Wiki page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/CarbonTwelve) to include the results of the [Node Topology Optimizer](https://github.com/dfinity/decentralization/).

As mentioned in the [Node Provider Onboarding documentation](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding), this document is intended to serve as the "pdf with the outcome of running the optimization model and the steps that allow the community to reproduce the validation check". 

**Can the Wiki moderators please approve the addition of this document to the Carbon Twelve wiki page?** 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks in advance.

Best,
Marc

hi，Any suggestions?
Looking forward to your reply.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-14 14:55:56 UTC | #303

Hi @Webgame,

If you already ordered the node machines before 1st Dec you can refer to https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Adding_additional_node_machines_to_existing_Node_Allowance, where it is suggested to make a node operator proposal and include proof of the ordering and order data of the machine. If you ordered the machines after the introduction of the optimization tooling, the agreed process is to include the output of the optimization tooling showing that the node machines add to the decentralizaton of the IC. 

Hope this explanation helps.

Dear Community, 

I'm excited to share that I have submitted two Node Operator Proposals for Carbon Twelve.

* [Proposal 126732](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126732) is to add 3 nodes in the pr1 data center.

* [Proposal 126733](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126733) is to add 4 nodes in the es1 data center.

The result of the canidate node machine validation and exact configuration run is available on the [C12 Wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/File:C12_Node_Topology.pdf) with SHA256 hash `fc8e3fdfd94f7a5c0a9a884fe949f44e206421fa47ac2844c69ba9c5658d57d2`. 

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you @SvenF for your assistance and support.

Your votes would be greatly appreciated! 

Best regards,

I have put the server purchase prove and IDC lease contract into the node addition proposal, and my proposal is connected
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126744.
Please check if there is any problem.

Thank you so much!

-------------------------

apollo13 | 2023-12-15 16:39:20 UTC | #308

I do not think these proposals to add a NO config should be approved without the Node Topology PDF. 

The last line on the wiki clearly states that one should wait for the NO to be approved before proceeding to the next steps ( that is ordering hardware ).

-------------------------

apollo13 | 2023-12-15 16:46:05 UTC | #309

Wiki Page: Node_Provider_Onboarding Last line clearly says to wait till it's executed.

Proposals which should be rejected:
Proposal 126482
Proposal 126530
Proposal 126744

Also severals links on these proposals are referring to PDFs on Amazon S3, they are not even referring to pages on internetcomputer wiki

These proposals should have not proceeded with any steps ( ex ordering hardware or signing contracts ) without getting the Node operator proposal added. 

However it would be fine for those who got the NO approval before Dec 1 and ordered there hardware or signed the contracts. 

Community thoughts ?

-------------------------

Webgame | 2023-12-15 17:23:26 UTC | #310

I completely followed the link in the WIKI, https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Adding_additional_node_machines_to_existing_Node_Allowance.  unless the machines were already ordered and in the process of being added to the IC network. In that latter case, please add evidence in the NNS reward configuration proposal that these machines have been ordered before 1st December and are actually in the process of being onboarded.

As for not using the internetcomputer wiki connection, it has been 15 days since December 1st. I just want to process the proposal faster (the link is just for proof, there is nothing wrong with it, and there is no mention in the WIKI that the evidence must be put into the internetcomputer wiki) , I can also upload to the internetcomputer wiki without any problems

-------------------------

apollo13 | 2023-12-16 00:09:30 UTC | #311

This is totally wrong. The Wiki page you are mentioning the link above ( I do not have permission to post link) was created on 4th Dec 2023. If you ordered hardware before that, the wiki clearly states to wait for the NO proposal to be approved. 


Along with community and per the timelines I strongly oppose the above proposals to be adopted. 
CC: @bjoernek @SvenF

[quote="apollo13, post:309, topic:16643"]
Proposal 126482
Proposal 126530
Proposal 126744
[/quote]

These treee proposals are wrongfully trying to onboard 26 nodes on the network 8 + 8 + 10. Which is very much against the timelines of the new Node topology agreement has been made by the community.

I want community to focus here and be very diligent here. You cannot put a Node proposal after 1st dec 2023 without a Node Topology comparision PDF period. 

if you ordered hardware before or signed a contract Node onboarding wiki clearly states to wait till your NO is approved.

@MalithHatananchchige is also correct here, "if you had node allocation approval before the 1st december" Which you do not @Webgame and the other GeoNodes LLC

-------------------------

Webgame | 2023-12-16 02:58:30 UTC | #314

I don't want to argue with you.
I am just actively seeking help from the community.  Due to the revised rules, we were unable to track the relevant information in time (we started submitting KR proposals on December 5th).  At present, we just hope to reduce the losses.  I think the emergence of this official rule "If you order before December 1st, you need to provide evidence." Community also thought about this issue

Hi all, Basic question here. What is the process for becoming a node operator.  Trying to jump in, but uncertain as to how to go about it. Many thanks! Brian

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-12-17 17:12:47 UTC | #317

 Hello Brian,

Becoming a node provider for the Internet Computer involves several steps. Here's a basic outline of the process:

1. Education: Before becoming a Node Provider, it's important to understand what the Internet Computer is and what the role of a Node Provider entails. You can read the [Introduction to ICP](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Introduction_to_ICP) and visit the official ICP website: [internetcomputer.org](https://internetcomputer.org/) to learn more.

2. Onboarding: Once you have a basic understanding of the Internet Computer, you can begin the onboarding process. This involves several steps, including: 

- Filling out a self-declaration form.

- Submitting a proposal and onboarding your nodes to the Internet Computer.  

- Joining the node provider matrix channel.

- Choosing and purchasing hardware. 

- Setting up servers in a data center.

You can find detailed instructions for these steps on the [Node Provider Onboarding](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding) page.

3. Validation of Candidate Node Machines: If you conclude that adding node machines helps decentralization of the IC network, the final step is to prepare to submit a proposal for onboarding these nodes. This involves several steps, including submitting a Node Provider Proposal, a Data Center Proposal, and a Node Operator Proposal. You can find detailed instructions for these steps on the [Validation of Candidate Node Machines](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines) page.  

4. Maintenance: Once your nodes are onboarded, it's your job to provide maintenance to your own nodes when hardware or networking issues arise. Node Providers are only rewarded for their nodes' useful work.

Remember, collaboration is at the core of the Internet Computer community, and your participation can contribute to the success of new Node Providers! 

I hope this helps, and best of luck on your journey to becoming a Node Provider!
