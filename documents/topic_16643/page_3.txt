Hello, everyone!

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126766

Kindly cast your vote to endorse AVRVM AG's inaugural data center in a secure former military bunker. Let's ensure the security of the IC with high-secure data centers nestled in the Swiss Alps.

Just updating that our be1 data center ([New Node Provider Proposals - #319 by AVRVM](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/319)) referring to the forum discussion ([Subnet Rental & Swiss Subnet](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-rental-swiss-subnet/25773)) will be part of the proposed Swiss Subnet.

Thank you.

You shouldn't buy hardware until you successfully went through the "Validation of Candidate Node Machines" and have your Node Operator Proposal approved.  There is then a wait of about 8 to 10 weeks between ordering your hardware and receiving the hardware at your DC.

Hello everyone
Hello DFINITY Team

I am introducing myself and writing to formally register as a Node Provider together with my brother as "Michael and Dominik Peterer". We are both passionate about the Internet Computer and aim to contribute to its decentralization by providing several nodes in Nairobi, KENYA, where Dominik Peterer is resident.
We have created our wiki page and uploaded our self-declaration form, proof-of-identity documents and results from the optimization tool, which shows that 4 nodes in Kenya contribute to decentralization of the IC.
We kindly ask the moderators (@SvenF @diegop) of the Wiki to approve our Wiki page and uploads (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Michael_and_Dominik_Peterer), so that we may formally submit the proposal to the NNS. Thank you for your support.

Best regards
Michael and Dominik Peterer

Hi all,

I would like to share that with the latest pipeline and node machines live, we have now reached the IC target topology, as can be seen from the graph below and verified using the latest data from the [decentralization repository](https://github.com/dfinity/decentralization). This is an important milestone, as it means that for all subnets, there are sufficient Gen2 (SEV-SNP) node machines and Gen1 node machines the reach the targeted decentralization coefficients: subnet limit of 1 for node provider, data center, and data center provider, and subnet limit 2 or 3 per country (you can find more details see [node diversification part 1](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-series-node-diversification-part-i/23402), [node diversification part 2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-node-diversification-part-ii/23553), [proposal 125367](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125367) and [proposal 125549](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125549)).

It also means that adding more new node machines to the IC network will not further improve the decentralization coefficients, so as agreed by the community the Foundation will reject any new node allowance proposals and node reward proposals except for the existing node onboarding pipeline. The pipeline contains node machines that have been ordered before 1st December (with evidence on the wiki page) and node machines that have added to the decentralization (with output of the optimisation tooling shared on the wiki page). Note that the IC being a decentralized network, the community may still decide to adopt specific proposals to add node machines.

In addition, in the future the community can also decide to update the IC target topology in line with further growth of the IC network in order to increase the number of required nodes and/or further improve decentralisation targets.

Let's continue to work together to the further growth of the IC network.

SvenF | 2024-02-29 18:37:15 UTC | #323

Hi all, 

Following up on the above post, please note that the Foundation will reject the following proposals:

* proposals [126754](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126754), [126755](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126755), [126756](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126756), [126757](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126757), [126758](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126758) as these do not add to the further decentralization of the IC network

* proposal [126759](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126759) for adding a new data center does not seem to be related to the node machine onboarding pipeline or any of the existing proposals. Hence, it is suggested to resubmit this proposal with further clarification on the reason for adding this data center.

* proposals [126760](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126760), [126761](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126761) and [126762](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126762) are for node machines ordered before the 1st December but need to have the proof included in the proposals so the community members can adopt these proposals. Hence, these proposals need to be resubmitted for voting.

Hopefully these people have not purchased their hardware yet. As that would be a waste of money.

Many many congratulations to @SvenF and the whole Dfinity team. Awesome progress for a truly decentralized blockchain + cloud. 

Will eagerly wait for the AI node updates and collaborations on how the Gen3 wave might look like :slight_smile:

Hello Forum,

Just updating that our be1 data center (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/319) referring to the forum discussion (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/subnet-rental-swiss-subnet/25773) will be part of the proposed Swiss Subnet.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-21 08:15:34 UTC | #328

Thank you @ritvick and @dfisher! It's definitely a big milestone for the IC network, the communications team is updated on it as well.

RulG | 2023-12-21 19:31:45 UTC | #329

Hi SvenF, I submitted yesterday a self-declaration and a proof of identity in order to provide a new node operator in Spain. 
I¬¥m just starting with all the process. I am getting information and prices from hardware providers and from data centers in Spain.
I plan to onboard 1 or 2 nodes in my country, Spain, as long as there are no nodes here. 
As I can read in your latest writting, the number of nodes is completed. 
I am excited about this proyect, so I would appreciate so much if there will be any ooption to install more nodes to give support to the ICP in the future.
Best wishes,
Ra√∫l.

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-12-22 03:46:24 UTC | #330

hey SvenF

I got a situation here the first HK DC I registered for IC nodes are not qualified with ipv6 environment after testing for days. So now we have reached out other DCs for continuing.
To shorten the time to join in IC network, we submitted two HK DC proposals trying to testing them meantime to see which one is capable, but now I found they are both rejected. 
Can you kindly instructed what should I do now?
Thanks!

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-22 08:22:15 UTC | #331

Hi @Lisa_Crato thanks for the update. I think the two data center proposals were technically okay but it was not clear which Node Provider submitted these proposals and for what reason, as the target topology was already reached. From the proposals also the neuron-ids seemed to be new and not linked to any existing node provider. What I suggest is to resubmit the proposal, and include a short description that states why it is submitted and a link to your node provider-id. Then it will be clear for the community why they need to adopt these proposals,
best, Sven

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-12-22 08:53:14 UTC | #332

Thanks SvenF
I also have read the new topology proposal and see we have to use the tool to validate how to participate. 
I‚Äôll use the tool first to see any change in rules and result.
Thanks

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-12-22 13:19:32 UTC | #333

hey SvenF

It is slow to download the tool from China so I am still waiting for it.
After checking the previous submitting operation, I guess there is one point I missed which led to the failure of the proposals.
When I register the second DC, if I want it to be under the same Node Provider, should I use the same 
neuron-id created for NP in step 3, not created a new one for step 8?
![0df5ab5a2cdbf92d00528699c543a6c|690x490](upload://m5CjDaoDVl3IYK9cC1k40m7LWTH.png)

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-22 15:25:15 UTC | #334

HI @Lisa_Crato in principle, you can use any NP principal to register a DC, and you can even use any existing DC as well in your Node Operator proposal. But for transparency to the community it would be best to use the same (original) Node Provider principal. That's why I proposed to add a short description in the proposal and share it in this thread so that it is clear for the community why this proposal is submitted.

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-12-22 15:31:30 UTC | #335

yes SvenF
I saw these words in the updated doc.
![ac193232937d1af2748177b0cb6c902|690x278](upload://3Ge0AZRGbxywyu5baww7veXTBCl.png)

I guess I need to use the same NP principe Neuron ID to register even a different DC and node provider.
btw, the speed of downloadin the optimization tool is quite slow from China. 
is there any restriction on our region for the tool?
If I cannot get the tool, I could not provide such information as stated in the doc.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-22 16:08:54 UTC | #336

Hi @Lisa_Crato as far as the team is aware there are no geo-restrictions on our Github repository, so it could be a general geo restriction or general latency issue.

Just one note for your awareness: since the IC network has reached target topology (see https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322?u=svenf), there are no new node machines being onbboarded expect for those in the current node-pipeline.

-------------------------

Lisa_Crato | 2023-12-23 02:47:51 UTC | #337

Thanks SvenF!
I have read them for more details.
two quesitons here:
1. I used optimiazaiton tool and got objectivevalue=0, does that mean no more nodes in this region?
2. what if I have no Node Provider ID in some region but I want to check the practicability of adding node in that region? I see I have to input the node provider name to further check.

**Change to My Node Provider Principal Due to Security Breach**

Dear All

I am an existing node provider in Georgia and Lithuania. I run the nodes under my name, George Bassadone. Recently, my ledger hardware wallet was compromised. In response to this incident, I have taken a necessary step to secure future distribution of rewards: I have changed my node provider principal.

**What Happened:**

* **Security Breach:** There was unauthorized access to my ledger hardware wallet, compromising the security.
* **Immediate Response:** To mitigate any further risk, I changed my node provider principal following the guidelines provided in Step 8 of the Node Provider Onboarding page.

The change in the node provider principal is not just a technical update; it's a critical move to ensure that future rewards are not at risk.

**What I Have Done:**

1. **Registered New Principal:** I've registered a new, secure principal in the NNS
2. **Transparency:** I've written this post and detailed the situation in my proposal to the NNS to maintain transparency and trust within our community.
3. **Seeking Support:** I am now seeking your support to acknowledge and approve this change via your vote on the proposal.

**How You Can Verify:**

* **Past Contributions:** My past interactions and contributions can be referenced for credibility.
* **Detailed Explanation in NNS Proposal:** I've included a detailed explanation in my proposal to the NNS, outlining the situation and the steps taken.
* **Open for Questions:** I am here and available for any questions or further information you may require. Please feel free to engage with me directly through this forum or any other official channel.

Thank you in advance for your support and understanding in this matter.

Best Regards,

George

Hello
I hope you are having good day.
I want to join and be node provider

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-27 17:40:52 UTC | #341

Hi @Allenz happy to have you join this community thread. Current the IC has reached target topology so there are node more additional node machines needed. With the IC network continuing to grow, this may change in the future when the community decides on updating the target topology to run more node machines. Feel free to post any questions in this thread or join the [matrix channel](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Matrix_channel) where more technical discussions take place, and the [Node Provider wiki pages](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Documentation) for more background information.

GAbassad | 2023-12-29 05:11:42 UTC | #343

Morning Sven,

Hope you are well. 

I am a little confused. What exactly do you mean by old rewards? The December rewards were already paid to the old principal ID. I would like for the rewards in January to start going to the new principal ID. Let me know if I am missing something here 

Thanks 

Kind regards,

George

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-12-29 11:31:13 UTC | #344

Hi @GAbassad understand. What I mean is that you would have to do the proposal to switch the node operator to the new NP-id first, before deleting the old NP-id, otherwise the proposal will fail to execute. So you have to submit the proposal for the node operator switch first.

-------------------------

GAbassad | 2023-12-29 12:01:01 UTC | #345

Hi Sven,

Thanks for clarifying. 

I‚Äôll go ahead and submit a new proposal to update the node operator records to point to the new node provider ID. 

ic-admin --nns-url [https://ic0.app](https://ic0.app/)propose-to-update-node-operator-config --node-operator-id <node-operator> --node-provider-id <node-provider> --summary "Explanation"

Please go ahead and reject the proposal to remove the old NP principal id. I‚Äôll resubmit the proposal once the proposal to update the operator records is passed

Thanks

-------------------------

GAbassad | 2024-01-03 18:20:55 UTC | #346

@SvenF 

Hi All, below is my proposal to remove the previous node provider principal. I believe something needs to be done manually on the backend before this proposal can get accepted, because tb1 nodes now show under new principal, but vl2 nodes not yet. 
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126852

-------------------------

GeoNodes | 2024-01-05 08:07:28 UTC | #347

Dear all,

We will be onboarding nodes in two data centres (cr1 and tv1) in the coming weeks. Ahead of this onboarding, we need to change our node provider principal due to a potential security breach of our ledger device. We currently have no nodes onboarded yet, but would like to do this as a precaution.

We will therefore be submitting 4 proposal in total and would appreciate the community‚Äôs support:
1. Add new node provider principal
2. & 3. Update node operator ID for each of our two data centres 
4. Remove the old node provider principal  

Thank you and feel free to ask as any question,
GeoNodes

ic.aitubi | 2024-01-05 17:24:55 UTC | #348

Dear All,

I am writing to formally introduce our firm AITUBI LTD to become a Node Provider to the Internet Computer.

We are a small family owned investment and innovation firm. We focus on entrepreneurial activities that we deeply understand and have disruptive innovation potential. Our past and current investment portfolio in private companies includes real estate, health insurance, cyber security insurance, electric mobility and IT network infrastructure, as well as various Internet Computer and SNS related projects.

Our focus will initially be nodes located in Australia with a plan to further expand in locations that positively contribute to the decentralization of the IC topology such as Asia and Africa, in line with recent [proposals](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-node-diversification-part-ii/23553).

Our [company](https://www.aitubi.ch/) is a [Swiss limited company](https://zg.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-251.314.220) held by shares and I am one of the directors.

We will in due course submit our NNS proposal, as well as the Proof of Identity and self-declaration document on the wiki.

Please feel free to reach out to me on the forum if you have any questions, and thank you for your consideration.

Regards,

For AITUBI Ltd
Fabian

Amazing, where can I read more about it?

-------------------------

03kalven | 2024-01-08 21:11:28 UTC | #350

Hi all, I hope you are doing well. 

As you may recall, Conic Ventures began the process of onboarding in September, where we proposed a deployment of 25 nodes in Sydney and 15 nodes in London. The initial proposal and data center proposal were both accepted (September 23 and 29, forum post https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/117?u=03kalven).

Today we submit two node operator proposals to the network for the deployment of four node machines (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126892, https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126893). Prior to the network topology update on December 1st, we finalized an agreement with our data center, Latitude.sh, for the lease of two nodes in Sydney and two nodes in London. Our agreement with our data center is under NDA, so we have provided a proof of our order signed by Latitude.sh accessible here: [proof of order](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/File:Conic_Ventures_proof_of_order.pdf). With this deployment, we add the first nodes in the United Kingdom for the IC and increase the network's presence in Australia.

Under our agreement with Latitude.sh, we have the ability to expand our node provisioning efforts across Latitude's network of data centers. As the Internet Computer continues to grow, we are excited to contribute by adding nodes in new geographies.

Please let us know if you have any questions about the proposals.

-------------------------

M4RK | 2024-01-09 06:55:36 UTC | #351

I have a question. I keep seeing that rewards for running a node provider are ICPs. However when I look at the calculations I seem to keep stumbling across the phrase XDR. What is that? if I used the calculation with the context of for example opening 1 node in Australia. Can someone more experienced tell me what the numbers might look like in terms of monthly rewards? I would greatly appreciate it. Just having a hard time figuring out the mathematics behind it lol (maths isn‚Äôt my forte). Thank you legends in advance.

ic.aitubi | 2024-01-10 16:00:52 UTC | #353

Hi @SvenF , thanks for your [reply](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-become-a-new-node-provider-aitubi/26232/2?u=ic.aitubi) and apologies for the double-post. I am aware of the fact decentralization have been reached and currently no new node machines are required. It would be good to understand what the community can best to to allow new node providers to join again.
One answer seems to be to help grow the number of developers, hence dapps, and ultimately cycles burned to the IC network, which will ultimately increase utilization and new demand for NP expansion.
I hope this can help unlock the current halt, since especially on the geographical dimension, the network is currently far from decentralized, with (southern hemisphere) emerging markets being under represented.

-------------------------

ic.aitubi | 2024-01-10 16:03:25 UTC | #354

Meanwhile, could you approve and publish our [self-declaration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Self_Declarations), so it is ready to go when admission opportunties arise again?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-01-10 16:42:40 UTC | #355

Hi @ic.aitubi agree with your observation. The target IC topology is mainly based on the number of subnets and the number of applications that are running on the subnets. The more we can help grow the community with developers, dapps and hence cycles burned, the higher the usage of the subnets and node machine and the more likely it is the IC needs more node machines.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-01-10 16:46:15 UTC | #356

@ic.aitubi it's for the wiki moderators to approve your publication on the wiki, this normally takes a few days after which you can submit your proposal.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-01-11 13:25:20 UTC | #357

Dear (candidate) NPs,

A gentle reminder - to facilitate notifications and/or trouble shooting, please add your contact details to the IC wiki, if you are willing to do so. Please see the necessary link here: [https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Matrix_channel ](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Matrix_channel)

Appreciate your support in improving the communication on any node provider topics.

Hello SvenF:
I bought my first node machine by Nov 30 2023 through ebay, if I provide sufficient information about the sale is there still any chance to onboard the network. 
Thanks

Hello, I would like to be a node operator with a data center. I am from Argentina, and in the node map I do not see any nodes in Latin America. Therefore I think it contributes to the geographical decentralization of the project. We are currently the only polkadot, kusama, and phala network node in Latin America. And at Phala network we have 300 workers contributing computational power to the network. We have a data center equipped for this purpose. And we would like to be able to have ICP nodes. Thanks

Hi everyone!

I hope this message finds you all well. 
I'm Khloe, BD at Cosmostation(Stamper Co.,Ltd). We are planning to create a proposal to be approved as a Node Provider for the IC with the entity name Stamper Co.,Ltd. As per the documentation and forum posts, I attempted to upload my team's Proof of Identity and Self-declaration documents on ICP wiki self-declaration page. It has been referred to ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù.

I am not sure if I did it correctly.
Could anyone let me know how long this moderation process would take?

Best regards
Khloe

vafi | 2024-01-22 07:29:12 UTC | #364

An investment of $30000 is too much for the rewards, they should be much higher. And/or allow people to onboard with less compute power.

-------------------------

vafi | 2024-01-22 07:29:55 UTC | #365

How much did you spend?

-------------------------

Legra133 | 2024-01-22 12:21:49 UTC | #366

Good morning vafi,
I spend about $24000 in total for 3 Dell r7525 barebone plus the rest off the parts. But only one was bought before the dead line, the other two were sold converted in ICP and moved to stake in a NNS Neuron for 8 years. I planing to at least onboard one, unit more subnets come in the future. Thanks

Sparklink_digital | 2024-01-22 18:31:53 UTC | #367

Hello SvenF, I am interested in contributing to the decentralization of the Internet Computer by, when the time is appropriate, facilitating the onboarding of a data center and several nodes in the UAE, where there is currently none. Any tips on figuring out if this is doable and when or how I should get ready for it would be awesome. Thanks a bunch!

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-01-23 18:03:28 UTC | #368

Hi @Sparklink_digital nice to hear from you and happy to have you as part of the community! It would be great to have a Node Provider in the UAE in the future. As you probably know, the IC has reached target topology so there are node more additional node machines needed. With the IC network continuing to grow, this may change in the future when the community decides on updating the target topology to run more node machines. If this happens an NNS proposal will be submitted for voting and an update will be send in this thread as well. 

In terms of tips, you might want to check the technical requirements for both node machines and networking, that are part of the [NP wiki pages](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Documentation), that might help in assessing the feasibility of node machines in the UAE. Feel free to participate in any technical discussion on the the [matrix channel ](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Matrix_channel) as well.

Greetings,

I am Mariano Stoll, well-known as the Head of Inside Dark Studio and a pivotal figure in the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and games across our ecosystem. Today, I write to discuss the activation of my nodes, a step further in my commitment to the ecosystem's growth. In November, I invested in four servers with the specific aim of serving as nodes, marking my transition towards becoming a node provider.

For your reference, here are the key documents pertaining to this initiative:

My goal is to not only contribute to the network's decentralization by introducing nodes in the Southern Cone, a region presently lacking in this infrastructure, but also to continue supporting the development of dApps and games that enrich our ecosystem. Additionally, my efforts aim to promote the adoption and use of ICP within the local community.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to contributing further to the network's growth and decentralization.

Best regards,

Mariano Stoll

Hi @SvenF, perhaps this is a follow-up on this question. I've been trying to educate myself as much as I can on the topic of being a node provider. Currently I do not own a single rig, but im enthusiastic about contributing to ICP in different ways (besides investing. I will also try to develop). I read that not every request/proposal would be accepted and that having a node in a less populated area would improve the chances of having a new node accepted.

So im interested In being a node provider in 2 countries. One in Guyana (South America) and one in The Netherlands (Europe). 

Besides purchasing machine(s) within your requirements and filling out the "Node Provider Self-declaration", am I missing anything else that would increase the likelihood of being accepted?

-------------------------

CodeLancasterX | 2024-01-30 19:10:32 UTC | #375

I forgot one last thing. I read that you were interested in knowing if the rig was purchased in 2023, why is that?

-------------------------

Kulesha_Natalia | 2024-01-31 01:08:01 UTC | #376

Hi everyone, am I correct in understanding that if the proposal will not pass and ICP tokens will be burned??

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-01-31 13:10:29 UTC | #377

Hi @CodeLancasterX my guess is that you already went through the [NP wiki pages](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Documentation). The process of becoming a NP is

1. submit the identity document and the self-declaration document on the wiki pages

1. submit the node provider proposal

1. submit a data center proposal (if you set up nodes in a new data center)

1. validate whether the node machines you intend to set up add to the decentralization of the IC network

1. submit a node operator record

1. onboard the node machines

1. submit a node operator record update to update the rewards on the nodes

Currently, the IC has reached target topology, see [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322). It means that no new node machines will be accepted to the IC network for the time being. Once the subnets are reaching capacity and more subnets are required to run all applications, the community can decide to increase the target topology again and allow additional node machines to the network. 

So for now, it is not possible to onboard any new node machines, but you can already submit your node proposal proposal (step 2 above) so you are prepared to submit a data center proposal and node operator proposal once it is decided that more nodes machines are allowed.

The reason for requesting to add proof of purchase before 1st Dec in the node operator proposal was exactly because of the target topology being reached. As we reached target topology at 1st Dec, any nodes purchased before 1st Dec could still proposed to be added to the IC network. 

Hope this clarifies.

SvenF | 2024-01-31 13:15:07 UTC | #378

Hi @Kulesha_Natalia that is correct. This is to avoid the misuse of the proposal function by submitting large number of proposals. See also [this link](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-network-nervous-system-governing-the-internet-computer-1d176605d66a#d0cc) for a more extensive description.

stollmar | 2024-02-01 12:22:54 UTC | #379

Hey @SvenF we got our proposal voted on negative by Dfinity, is there a reason of this? did we do something wrong?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-02-01 14:05:44 UTC | #380

Hi @stollmar there's nothing wrong with the wiki submission and documentation, but the link to the identity document as well as the hash needs to be added to the proposal. The proposal now only has the link and hash of the self-declaration document. If you resubmit the same proposal and add the link and hash to the identity document, you're proposal should be okay to be voted in.

Hi @SvenF The 7 Nodes that were approved by Proposal 124524 have now been onboarded. As per the changed procedures introduced late last year I have attached proof that the machines were ordered before 1 December 2023. I have also included the emails that communicate updating the node_pipeline.csv file to include these nodes.

Thank you

CodeLancasterX | 2024-02-04 11:29:01 UTC | #384

Thanks for your reply, that explains a lot. What is still a bit vague on my part is how to go about setting up the node machine after purchase. As you mentioned and as I've seen on other pages, datacenters have been mentioned a couple of times. I am interested in purchasing a node machine, but if my understanding is correct, this is not something I can setup just anywhere. 

Same for the node operator record, if one purchases a node machine strictly for setting it up for IC, then it wouldn't have any record. Sorry if there's any silly questions there, but ive only been on investing side of the coin thus far and im willing to also do it by providing the node. 

Thanks for your patience

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-02-06 13:41:50 UTC | #386

Hi @CodeLancasterX you are correct on the node machine location and data center location. The reasoning behind the IC Target Topology is to decentralise the network across several different dimensions, i.e. node providers, data centers, and location. This means that per subnet (we have 37 subnets currently), there can be only one node machine for each node provider in the subnet, one node machine for each data center in the subnet, and two node machines for each country in the subnet. So yes, the location of the Data Center, and the number of node machines you want to onboard as a Node Provider are important for the decentralisation of the IC. There is a [optimization tool](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Validation_of_Candidate_Node_Machines) available on the wiki where you can validate whether new node machines would actually help the decentralization. 

Not sure what your question regarding node operator record refers to. A new node machine, once onboarded, is "ready to join a subnet". Depending on whether additional nodes are needed in a subnet, for example if another node is unhealthy or dead due to hardware issues, that new node machine will be "swapped" for the unhealthy/dead node machine, and hence joins the subnet. Another reasons for swapping a new node machine for another node machine in a subnet might be to improve the decentralization in that subnet. 

Hope this clarifies.

Hi everyone,

My name is Gael Chloe,  I'm an independent investor and part of the IC community since 2022.

I'm writing to formally register as a Node Provider under the entity NODAL CAPITAL. I would like to start by adding 6 nodes in Brazil.
I plan to increase the number of nodes in Brazil in the future and extend to Uruguay and Colombia. My vision is to see IC nodes all over the world, and it would be a privilege to be the first node provider in South America.

My self-declaration documents, the Company Certificate, and my Proof of Identity are uploaded to the Internet Computer Wiki under [NODAL CAPITAL](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/NODAL_CAPITAL).

Hi all, I need to update the node operator record. I want to relocate my node from Espacio Rack to IPCore Datacenter because Espacio Rack DC cannot provide me with IPv6. [The link](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127708).

-------------------------

SvenF | 2024-02-13 10:11:22 UTC | #394

Hi @gaelchloe, thanks for submitting the NP proposal. Please note that currently, the IC has reached target topology, see [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322). It means that no new node machines will be accepted to the IC network for the time being. Once the subnets are reaching capacity and more subnets are required to run all applications, the community can decide to increase the target topology again and allow additional node machines to the network.

So for now, it is not possible to onboard any new node machines unless these machines were already bought before the 1st December when the target topology and optimization tooling was approved by the community. You can already submit your node proposal proposal so you are prepared to submit a data center proposal and node operator proposal once it is decided that more nodes machines are allowed.

-------------------------

gaelchloe | 2024-02-14 15:32:35 UTC | #395

Hi,

Could you ELI5 why the IC has decided to stop onboarding new nodes?

I understand that the "target topology" is reached but isn't the more the better? And if some community members are still interested, why stop here?

I've drafted the pros and cons of rejecting all new new-node proposals:

**Pros**
- ???

**Cons**
- On socials, critics are saying that the IC controls node providers, jeopardizing decentralization.
- Decentralization is often evaluated by the number of nodes and even if this is an oversimplification, it's something the average joe can understand; topology isn't.
- More node providers means more advocates who are actively spreading the word about the IC.
- Some people haven't seen your post and are still [making proposals](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/397?u=marcpp). Some influencers are investigating how much it would cost to make a node and saying they're interested to build one. Rejecting proposals brings confusion imho.

Could you help me fill in the "Pros" section? :pray:

louisevelayo | 2024-02-23 16:22:35 UTC | #401

Hi @marcpp,

I just want to start this by saying I do completely agree with the sentiment. It isn't ideal that new nodes cannot be added. But at the same time, I do see why it is best to put a hold on it for now.

[quote="marcpp, post:398, topic:16643"]
why the IC has decided to stop onboarding new nodes?
[/quote]
Strictly speaking, the IC does not have a ban on onboarding new nodes. I believe it is more a community sentiment ie. DFINITY will vote against new node machine onboarding proposals. And even though it is getting better, DFINITY does have quite a bit of voting power (not to mention that most voters follow DFINITY) and so it is likely that onboarding new node machines would be rejected. 

That being said, I believe submitting a proposal to be a node provider and a new data center is still fair game. And if you are able to make a really strong case for your nodes to be onboarded, then maybe there is a chance :sweat_smile:

Regarding the pro's and con's, I think a similar one could be made for accepting new node proposals if we strictly talk about pro's and con's for the network. 

I believe that adding nodes to the network has two main purposes, adding to the geographic decentralization and adding to compute capacity. 

As the target topology states, adding new nodes anywhere doesn't really improve geographic decentralization, as with the current topology, no country would be present in a subnet more than two or three times, depending on the size of that subnet. Then for compute capacity, the target topology, which already allocates spare capacity for expected growth, requires 751 nodes, which is about 50% of the total nodes that are already onboarded to the network. So adding nodes wouldn't make a significant contribution in adding compute capacity.

Overall, I believe the main issue is that there isn't a significant "pro" for the network when it comes to adding nodes. And say nodes were added, it would be a waste of resources: the node would be consuming resources and not actually producing useful work for the network. 

Like I mentioned at the start, I do agree with your POV. But at the same time, it wouldn't be very responsible/sustainable to set up nodes just to sit in a rack, not contributing useful work to the network. 

While it is not ideal, I think this temporary pause gives aspiring NPs a chance to plan well and potentially collaborate to form the most cost-effective and possibly green operations for when the gates open again üöÄ

-------------------------

marcpp | 2024-02-23 20:44:58 UTC | #402

@frezabek 
I think [this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322) from Dfinity explains it. I think it should be stickied in this thread if that's somehow possible.
And just above your last posts is [mine](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/398?u=marcpp) where I'm asking why Dfinity would want to stop accepting new node providers.

@louisevelayo 
As a disclaimer, I want to say that I'm not a node provider nor do I intend to become one. I'm only an IC advocate who's also hoping for ICP to be the most fair and decentralized blockchain. So, what about you: has your node been accepted?

Thank you for your answer but it's still unclear:
[quote="louisevelayo, post:401, topic:16643"]
adding nodes wouldn‚Äôt make a significant contribution
[/quote]
[quote="louisevelayo, post:401, topic:16643"]
it wouldn‚Äôt be very responsible/sustainable to set up nodes just to sit in a rack, not contributing useful work to the network.
[/quote]
Could you elaborate? Are fees earned by Node Providers proportionally distributed between all NPs? If onboarding too many NPs made being a NP unprofitable at the current level of traffic on the ICP, then that could be a good reason to stop onboarding. But I'm not sure it works that way. Does it?

[quote="louisevelayo, post:401, topic:16643"]
there isn‚Äôt a significant ‚Äúpro‚Äù for the network when it comes to adding nodes

I am pretty sure it does not work this way either. What I meant by this is that is you look at the [public dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/), only 559 nodes are active in a subnet. The rest are just awaiting a subnet. When they are in this state, these nodes are just "spare nodes" and are not actually doing any useful work. The target topology only requires 751 nodes and this also includes spare nodes as well.Considering we are currently at 1399 nodes, any subsequent nodes added would also be in this "awaiting subnet state" and not producing useful work.

[quote="marcpp, post:402, topic:16643"]
Not sure whether they‚Äôre significant enough, but I just gave you 4 off the top of my head. And I‚Äôm sure we can find more.
[/quote]

My apologies, I should have clarified. You are right in that allowing new node machines to the network would address the 4 reasons you listed. When I said "there isn't a significant pro for the network", I was strictly speaking about the protocol and usage of the hardware. 

So just to rephrase, if new nodes are added at this point, it is unlikely they will be producing useful work, which is not such a good use of hardware but also energy. Even though they aren't producing useful work, they are still consuming resources in the DC.

More nodes means more inflation. Simple as that. So the IC only approves what it needs + some buffer. 

The nodes do not "share" rewards. The rewards are calculated per node machine based on a formula.

Hi @frezabek, your proposal looks okay but I see that it does not include an identity document with a hash of the document. There is a link to the university website, but I guess that would not be sufficient as an identity document nor does it include a hash so it is difficult for the community to verify afterwards that the identity document was changed. I suggest to resubmit including an identity document & hash.

Please be aware that the community has decided that no new node machines are being onboarded for the time being. See also [this link](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322?).

Hi everyone,

My name is Nikola Nikov and I'm partner at delta.bg

I am writing you as I want to become a Node Provider and do my homework in advance.
I'm aware that at current stage no new nodes will be accepted, but I want to be prepared with the Node Provider documentation and registration in advance.

I have created the necessary wiki page [https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Nikola_Nikov](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Nikola_Nikov) with the Self-Declaration form and Identity Proof.

I'm applying as personal identity as this is something that won't change, although I will use the company contracts with data centers and infrastructure. ( depending on the location, the legal entity might be different ).

Some words about me :

I consider myself mostly Software Developer and crypto enthusiast, but also a Network Engineer. Recently I‚Äôm exploring ICP, and this is they main reason that I decided that I can help by a becoming Node Provider.

Some words about the company:

We have contracts with most of the datacenters locally in Sofia, Bulgaria and our own racks inside.

We maintain our own network under AS8860 with more than 500 Gbps capacity to be able to serve digital content, and also to handle possible DDoS attaks. [https://bgp.he.net/AS8860#_peers](https://bgp.he.net/AS8860#_peers)

We also currently develop infrastructure in Turkey, Africa, Middle East and India.

My proposal number : 128151
[https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128151](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128151)

Thank You !

Hello everyone! My name is Paul Creasey and I have just submitted my self declaration on the wiki page for approval by the moderators. I am fully aware that currently no new nodes are being onboarded, but would nonetheless like to register as a node provider to be ready for the future. I plan to contribute nodes to the IC in the future, in a new country where no new IC nodes are currently present. I would be grateful if the moderators could approve my uploads on the wiki page. Thank you.

Hello @SvenF,

I am a new member of the ICP community, i am from Morocco and i would like build a community here as  well i also would like to operate as a node provider is there any chances?

-------------------------

louisevelayo | 2024-02-28 08:07:05 UTC | #409

Hey @HamzaSan, great that you're interested in being a node provider!

I recommend that you read [this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322) so that you are aware of the current state of the network (TL;DR: the IC is at target topology so no new nodes are being added for the moment).

You can definitely still register as a node provider just as those have done in the posts above. I believe you can also submit a proposal to register the data center you with to operate from in Morocco. That  being said, there is currently no [remuneration model](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) for Morocco yet. So I wouldn't order any hardware or sign any contracts with service providers just yet :sweat_smile:

Dear All,

I hope this message finds you all in good health. I am writing to formally register as a Node Provider under Timur Rakhimzhan identity. I would like to add nodes in Kazakhstan, aiming to extend the network‚Äôs reach not only within the country but also across the whole Central Asia. I‚Äôll start with one node, but have plans to add more nodes if the first one will be launches successfully. 

You can find my new proposal to join the network by clicking on this link: `[Proposal Link](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128106)`

My self-declaration documents are also uploaded to the Internet Computer Wiki under `[Timur Rakhimzhan](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Timur_Rakhimzhan)`. In addition to this, you can check my `[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timur-rakhimzhan-2716711b7/)`.

Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am grateful for your support and votes in favor of accepting my proposal!

Best regards,
Timur Rakhimzhan

Hi,
can anybody explain why my proposal has been rejected from the DFINITY Foundation ?
I believe that I have fulfilled all the requirements regarding the documentation upfront.

Hi @nikolanikov  your proposal looks okay but I see that it does not include an identity document with a hash of that document. If you resubmit and include that as well I think your proposal should be allright.

-------------------------

nikolanikov | 2024-02-29 15:52:27 UTC | #413

What do you mean that it does not include Identity document? It includes bank statement that shows Name and Address, also with the SHA256 hash of this. I have also included although it is not required, and others are not providing it, international passport that I hide sensitive information like numbers, but you can see the Names, the Country, and the signature that matches, which should be more than enough .
I have reviewed the other Wiki pages, and some people are providing invoices as Identity document which is is accepted and ridiculous, as you can simply create authentic invoice by order something from somewhere and put whatever data you want. At least the bank statement is an officially approved proof of address identity document.

Hi @nikolanikov thanks for your questions and you raise some good points. I think there are two separate items here
- what documents to use for identity-verification
- the NNS proposal

There are currently no strict requirements to what documents are required for identity-verification, and it is good to have a discussion in the community whether and how this should be changed going forward. Note that the hardware invoices are not related to identity-document, these for those NPs that were already onboarded but bought node machines before the optimization tooling was introduced; the hardware invoice in those cases is attached to the Node Operator NNS proposals. 

For the Node pProvider NNS proposal, it should the link to the identity-document with the hash, and a link to the self-declaration including the hash. This allows community members to verify afterwards that the proposal matches with the documents that have been uploaded on the wiki. The documents you uploaded all look okay. My comment referred that the proposal did not include the link to the identity document and the hash in the proposal itself.

-------------------------

nikolanikov | 2024-03-01 11:29:37 UTC | #417

Hi thank you for the clarification. 
I have created new NNS proposal containing also the SHA256 hashes for my identity proof documents :

Dear all,

I would like to formally register as a Node Provider. I plan to onboard a limited number of new nodes in countries where there are currently no IC nodes present, once node onboarding opens up again. I look forward to contributing to the further decentralisation of the IC in the future and to support the growth of the IC.

My self declaration documents can be found here: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Paul_Creasey

If you have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Your support and votes to adopt this proposal would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Paul
