Hey everyone,

Just want to share the latest release of Stoic Wallet. We released an updated user interface and design and cleaned up some code behind the scenes. Stoic started off as a simple dev tool we used internallybefore we decided to release it as a wallet. With it you can connect to it using your Internet Identity, or you can use a seed phrase and access it like other decentralized wallets (e.g. metamask). In future we will support hardware wallets and eventually allow PEM key imports (for seed users).

![6f2e5a09-3b52-4519-9aa5-293e3b051fdf|690x410, 100%](upload://18BOpEDhdE8bcr1CvJLMFn5PrT9.png)

**We want Stoic to become a multi-platform wallet with the ability to:**
1. Manage and store currencies, like ICP and other tokens (check out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/toniqlabs), we are airdropping worthless $NIQ tokens for fun)
2. Manage neurons for general governance and staking of ICP
3. To manage NFT's in a sort of "infinite backpack" type way
4. Integrate with 3rd party tools and apps (games, exchanges, liquidity pools, atomic bridges)
5. Pay for things online/in person using your device and QR codes

We have complete and released **#1** and are close to completing **#2** and **#3** (both are in test - release end of the month/early July, so get ready for some NFT airdrops!). In regards to **#4**, please get in touch if you want to collab with us as we would love to assist with getting tokens deployed and added to our wallet.

Any questions, fire away below or on twitter! 

Check our wallet out at StoicWallet.com and our website, ToniqLabs.com and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/toniqlabs) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@toniqlabs)

wow very cool. looking forward to the pem key and seed management

-------------------------

Claude1 | 2021-06-24 00:42:23 UTC | #3

Will seed users eventually be able to put their seed into a hardware wallet and use that to interface with their neurons? I'm not sure what pem key import entails but that doesn't sound secure.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-06-24 01:15:13 UTC | #4

ya that would be nice. During the AMA they said: 

"there are plans to have a proper app the ledger app store. It's in the works, but it still won't allow to manage seed neurons via the GUI, unfortunately."

https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/o4zdy6/comment/h2qzuzz/

this comment was in relation to to the NNS app though. Not sure if Stoic wallet would be able to do that since they don't have the same limitations as the NNS app has

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-06-24 02:34:32 UTC | #5

No support for seed > hardware wallets. PEM import would work similar to MyEtherWallet where you have to choose the file everytime. We may make this only available on the desktop app as well.

Hi! I noticed something strange. When I connect to the wallet with II and log out and then log in with another user number with the same fido-key it recognizes me with the first Principal ID regardless of me changing the user number. Hows that possible? Maybe someone wanna try this...

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-06-24 17:06:51 UTC | #7

Thanks! I think it's just not registering the change in principal so is purely a visual bug, however you shouldn't be able to send tokens from the first II account using the second logged in one. We'll do some testing and get it fixed asap. Thanks for finding this

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-06-24 17:15:07 UTC | #8

Quick follow up - yeah found the bug, as per what I was expecting. The fix wont be released for another day though as we are in the middle of a build release/test phase. As the bug is purely visual, and it has no effect on any stored tokens and is only local, it's not a high priority. Thanks again for finding this bug though :slight_smile:

-------------------------

timo | 2021-07-02 14:51:22 UTC | #9

Loving to see this wallet. Thanks!
One thing that would be nice is to have a "Max" button to send exactly the full balance minus the fee. In other words, emptying out the account. When trying it by hand I noticed that there might be a bug calculating whether there are enough funds or not. For example, with 0.0010 ICP in the account I could send 0.0009 no problem. But with less than that it didn't work anymore to subtract 0.0001 from the balance and to send that. The error was "insufficient funds".

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-07-02 20:41:15 UTC | #10

Thanks, we will definitely be adding a few features like this in the next release. Thanks:-)

-------------------------

rdnkjdi | 2021-07-06 05:49:05 UTC | #11

this looks awesome! I'm looking forward to full hardware support. . .

-------------------------

wordkeepa | 2021-07-09 02:46:35 UTC | #12

When I login to Stoic with my Internet Identity, I'm getting a wallet with totally different address and it is empty. Why is that? Shouldn't I get the same wallet as in NNS?

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-07-09 03:47:48 UTC | #13

No - II gives you a different principal (private key) on a per domain basis. This will not be the same as NNS

-------------------------

harish007 | 2021-07-09 05:07:11 UTC | #14

I created a custom erc20 token in Motoko local environment. Is this any possibility of adding custom tokens in stoic wallet

-------------------------

stopak | 2021-07-12 18:37:28 UTC | #15

Hi, we are working on NFT project od DFINITY. Is it possible to integrate with your wallet?

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-07-12 18:49:59 UTC | #16

Yeah man, send me a msg lets get in touch.

-------------------------

icpcoincidence | 2021-07-17 08:59:10 UTC | #17

I tried to stake with the stoic wallet but the ICP just went to some adress without showing a neuron in my wallet? How can i connect to the new neuron?

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-07-17 15:03:51 UTC | #18

Thanks - this was fixed in private, all working now :slight_smile:

-------------------------

UncleBot | 2021-07-29 12:41:32 UTC | #19

Just to confirm, this Stoic wallet is a supported/recognized wallet by the DFinity team correct? And staking is available on the current version? 

Thanks.

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-07-29 18:49:28 UTC | #20

We are listed on the showcase section, but that's it. We weren't commissioned to build it or anything like that, so it's definitely considered 3rd party. Staking is available yes

-------------------------

UncleBot | 2021-07-29 20:12:16 UTC | #21

OK, thank you for the response.

-------------------------

moritz_tum | 2021-08-03 14:48:44 UTC | #22

Can you use/test the wallet with the local environment?

-------------------------

Satan | 2021-08-05 15:36:10 UTC | #23

Hello, I have been buying the Cronics using my ICP. I really love the collection. What I’m wondering is: can I send my cronics to another NFT wallet? And, when is the actual game going to be available? Are the rules available? Thank you for your time and excellent work with the wallets. It sweet that my IC Anchor is attached to the wallet holding the Cronics.

-------------------------

adewerra | 2021-08-06 22:32:04 UTC | #24

Him any news on the PEM key imports (for seed users) to be able to get access to our seed tokens and change the neurons to tokens and send them to the DAPP or Coinbase account ???
Or is there any solution out there so I can claim my seed tokens, thanks

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-08-06 23:26:07 UTC | #25

You can import seed keys already, Import account > PEM file. You can manage your seed neurons etc from here

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-08-06 23:26:51 UTC | #26

Any wallet that supports our NFT standard can hold these. You will need to ask the wallet dev you want to send to if that's the case

-------------------------

adewerra | 2021-08-06 23:37:10 UTC | #27

And transfert the token to Coinbase for example ?
Thanks

						Baron Alexis de Werra

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-08-06 23:43:15 UTC | #28

Sure, you can send any unlocked funds anywhere you want :)

-------------------------

snoopyfan | 2021-08-07 11:19:20 UTC | #29

Hi!
After importing seed keys with the PEM file...
If I disburse one neuron... where do the ICPs of that neuron go?
Will appear as a new account wallet in the Stoic account bar?
Thanks!

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-08-07 12:13:50 UTC | #30

Disbursed will go into your Main Account. Thanks!

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-08-07 14:32:59 UTC | #31

Can you manage the seed neurons yet in stoic? Adjust dissolve delay, and Add more ICP to a staked seed neuron, etc.

From what I understand it's currently not possible to increase the staked amount in a seed neuron using dfx command line.  Is that right?

-------------------------

tamton1 | 2021-08-19 09:45:44 UTC | #32

Hi, staking ICP on stoic wallet as the same as NNS. because i just sign up
 it has same profit, locking time and must voting?

-------------------------

adewerra | 2021-09-22 11:54:08 UTC | #33

Hi, i have been adding funds to my neurons, its right when i go into the explorer but the amounts doesn't change when i look with stoicwallet, the amount always stays the same.
Also is there a way to delete empty neurons?
thank you for your app, really simplifies my life,

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-09-22 15:00:32 UTC | #34

I believe you have to send at least 1 ICP for it to trigger an update - regardless tho it will update (things may have changed with how it works so I will take a look too).

Currently empty neurons will auto delete after some time (can't be done manually)

-------------------------

adewerra | 2021-09-23 12:40:06 UTC | #35

Hi, what you mean send 1 icp to trigger update ?? I added 200icp to the neuron but nothing changed?
thanks

-------------------------

wgfernandes_BR | 2021-09-25 08:04:13 UTC | #36

Is there any way to hide the neurons with zero ICP in the Neuron Management windows of the Stoic wallet?

Will be possible to merge neurons the same way we can now top-up neurons?

Thanks!

-------------------------

Wrldd | 2021-09-28 01:54:08 UTC | #37

Please how do you access your NFT collections without knowing the ID? I imported an existing account and I couldn't see my NFT. Please help!

-------------------------

bytesun | 2021-09-29 15:23:15 UTC | #38

-------------------------

iFollowDfinity2 | 2021-10-02 00:49:29 UTC | #39

Whenever I try connect with stoic wallet I just get a blank screen, any ideas why?

-------------------------

adewerra | 2021-10-02 12:32:59 UTC | #40

Hi, when i check with exlporer the neuron, the stake is always the same but if I check the icp address, the amount is right, seems it has not taken into account to toping up of the neuron ? any idea why is that and how to resolve ?
thanks

Hi
I send My ICP coin to stoicwallet
Now
How Forward My ICP from stoicwallet to another Digital address??

-------------------------

Celae | 2021-11-22 15:02:10 UTC | #42

Hi 

Yesterday I’ve realized that my seed phrase was lost therefore I immediately opened my wallet in order to secure the funds. I checked the settings hoping to find the phrases which unfortunately did not lead to them but then I saw the section saying “Connect via Gmail”. 
Thinking it was just like all the other websites, linking my account to my Gmail which seemed a reasonable way to proceed however it just created a whole new wallet! 
Going forward, checked the settings page and saw that I could still switch to my original wallet; once proceeded I was asked for my password which I entered but after hitting enter the whole page went blank !! After that, the browser never opened the wallet back again and then logged me off…

I tried opening the stoic website on another browser, it worked. Tried to open it on incognito mode, it worked. I tried creating a wallet and then connecting my Gmail to see the same error would happen again, it worked perfectly well many times with no error. And even when I close the incognito page and reopen it, the account was still logged in. So this happened only with the wallet that I have all my funds...

Now that I do not have the seed phrase I cannot reach my wallet where my all funds are in. Since the Stoic wallet is still in the development process I will kindly ask for your help.


I’m still in shock please help me get over this situation since this is the only option left.

Sincerely

-------------------------

Hi Stephan, I have a few questions regarding creating a new ERC20-token on IC and just wondering if I can email or have a chat about this directly?

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2021-11-26 11:41:51 UTC | #44

Can you DM me please, I've seen a few people report this error but we can't seem to track it. If I can work with you directly I should be able to debug and resolve this

Hi. Is there a way to have a login on one's site using stoic? Is there available documentation for this?

-------------------------

Any ETA for hardware wallet support?

-------------------------

AnonymousCoder | 2022-04-13 13:55:17 UTC | #49

Hello :) I am also wondering is there **any** sort of documentation for stoic wallet (ie: how to set it up locally and /or live, logging into the IC app with it and similar).

-------------------------

saintleeGC | 2022-11-05 11:25:41 UTC | #50

Hi team, I am having problems with my Stoic wallet. I am currently unable to access my ICP balance. NFT or other tokens are still displayed normally.
I tried connecting with ICPswap, entrepot,... but still not working.
I checked on icscan, and my ICP balance is still there.
Can you check it again and tell me how to fix it?

-------------------------

sea-snake | 2022-11-05 12:00:16 UTC | #51

This was due to a suspended IC domain, issue should be resolved, more info there: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/is-https-internetcomputer-org-down-for-everyone/16383

@stephenandrews  Sorry for asking here but I can't seem to be able to respond in the topic about StoicIdentity or create a thread about this.

I'm using the StoicIdentity to sync with the waller, but as far as I can see, using StoicIdentity I can only retrieve the Principal ID, not the Wallet Address. Does anybody know if there any way to get the Wallet Address?

Hi,

I use Stoic wallet nearly since I'm with ICP, but it hasn't been updated for a while and seems there is currently no such plan:

**For me is the best 'workaround' connecting my Stoic to @ICPSwap** where I can view and manage all my (fungible) tokens:

-------------------------

Ajki | 2024-01-03 15:38:59 UTC | #64

Because of things like this, the NNS should have a basic wallet for all ICP tokens and NFTs.

-------------------------

plsak | 2024-01-03 17:25:20 UTC | #65

Yeah it would be nice, but note that on ICP anyone can create a token, even using nice GUI - like on https://canister.app/store, so I'm not sure if such broad support on NNS is realistic and actually desired.

Hello ) I have an issue with Stoic wallet, with dissolving staked ICP in Stoic Wallet. I staked 10 ICP on 09/10/2022 for a period of 1 year. I've entered my Stoic Wallet a few times since December 2023 and tried to dissolve tokens but nothing has changed, it was only processing it. I would really appreciate your assistance and advice on how to solve this problem. I've contacted DFinity Support, ToniqueLabs and StoicWallet  on Twitter, but it didn't help. I'd like to dissolve my tokens and ask you for support and assistance on how to do it.

Hello,

I have a problem to connect to my Stoic Wallet with web3auth. When i am try to connect it opens to choose what account is linked Google, Github, Facebook etc. and as the wallet is connected to google account i selected it and it starts to load but nothing more happens please help.

-------------------------

hehe | 2024-01-24 05:03:53 UTC | #69

Same problem, no one cares? What good is it for IC future to have such a team in charge of CKbtc's KYT?

-------------------------

hehe | 2024-01-24 05:12:45 UTC | #70

If you have used bioniq.io, you will realize that for a long time it's platform's CKbtc is also not transferable (what's the reason for restricting users?). Mr. BobBodily, the CEO of bioniq platform and also Toniq Labs, by doing this, you are damaging IC's reputation and at the same time discouraging others from using your platform. (Just tried it, ckbtc transfers work for now)
