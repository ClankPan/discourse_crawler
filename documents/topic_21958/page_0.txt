# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```shell
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires an x86-64 based machine, Ubuntu 20.04 or a newer version of the OS, Git, and Podman.
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/master/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -p 123922

Hey just an heads up, there is an oversight in the changelog, the one posted is from last week.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of this replica update.  Results are provided below.  @Luka as noted by @Zane in his comment above, the "summary of changes" that you used in your OP above is from proposal 123784 instead of proposal 123922.  You might want to edit the forum post to show the correct details.  Our review is based on the content of proposal 123922, which is IC release f8f59f8.

Proposal ID: **123922**
Neuron: CodeGov.org
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566132/nns-proposal-123922) 
Voting history: [Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100&vh-topic=TOPIC_REPLICA_VERSION_MANAGEMENT)

At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period.  I encourage NNS voters to review the replica update proposal and vote manually.  Of course, you always have the choice to follow another person or another organization who is voting independently.  At this time, I am aware of [CodeGov.org](https://www.codegov.org/) neuron and [Taggr Network](https://taggr.top/#/realm/NNS-GOV) neuron who are performing this work, both of which are registered known neurons.

RECRUITING NOTE: 
The CodeGov Project is offering attractive bounty payments in search of experienced Rust developers who are interested in spending a few hours each week reviewing Replica Version Management proposals.  We do this through IC-OS Verification and by performing a sanity check on the Release Notes.  Our votes are cast according to the findings of our reviewers.  Proposals are usually submitted on a Friday and we complete our reviews within 48 hours.  Each reviewer posts a summary of their findings in the CodeGov portal on DSCVR.one and the bounty payment is made using the tipping feature of DSCVR with ckBTC equivalent to USD.  The bounty is always announced in [this bounty payment post](https://dscvr.one/post/11096526/the-current-bounty-per-person-for-reviews-ic-os-verification) on the portal and the [deliverables for each review](https://www.codegov.org/reviews/deliverables) can be found on the codegov.org website.  It is a requirement to [Apply](https://www.codegov.org/apply) on the codegov.org website and to complete either Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN in order to get paid the bounty.  Please send me a DM or an email at codegov.org@gmail.com if you would like to discuss this opportunity further.
