I created two actors in the motoko playground and one needs to call the other. What is the proper syntax for doing so?

Interesting, never tried before ;)

I think you need two playgrounds, one for each actor.
Then, deploy first actor and import the canister in the second actor (see screenshot).

Finally, you can `import` the first canister in the second canister

```
import Echo "canister:main";
```

Example:

First Actor -> https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/?tag=143833688

Second Actor -> https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/?tag=3635762171
