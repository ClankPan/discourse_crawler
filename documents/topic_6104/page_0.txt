Hi
I browsesd documentations and codes but could find the answer to this question.
In CanCan, when a video is saved, is it encrypted in some way? I could not find where this happens in the codes, anyone can guide me? Is it something that happens on canister level automatically?

It does not happen automatically, however there is a canister in development that would provide this service. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16xxA8EKEhE
