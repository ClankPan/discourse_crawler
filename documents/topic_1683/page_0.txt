it seems like you don’t have enough space on your machine? can you double check this?

I have two questioins 
1 - whey the dfx IC goes down if such errors "fail installing canisters" occuer ?
2 - this is the standard steps not success but in the 0.6.10 all example projects succeeded. I think something related to the new canister id encryption type ?

If you need to, you can revert to a previously installed version by editing the version no in your project’s dfx.json file.

Or to install a previous version that isn’t already cached on your machine use: `DFX_VERSION=0.6.14 sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"`

Hi amr 
Are you running version 2 of WSL? Windows isn’t officially supported but if you follow this you should have success: [https://forum.dfinity.org/t/native-windows-support/1241/2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/native-windows-support/1241/2)

I also encountered the same problem:
