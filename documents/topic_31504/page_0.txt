is there a way to see these? and if no, are these tracked somewhere publicly?
i'm asking because if a smartcontract implements vetKeys to encrypt some data in the argument passed by the user to the method called, it would not count as privacy? since the methods called and their arguments are publicly available and readable at the explorer/scanner level.

Method calls are not public information unless the canister somehow manually makes that information accessible
