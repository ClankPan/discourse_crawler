So now you’re wondering WHY? Why not just use AWS then if its stoppable? And the best and most succinct answer I’ve read is from a gentleman named David Gurion. He says “One might ask then, what is the point at all, we have AWS. The point is this: we do not have a decentralized AWS. That’s it. That’s the difference. Using decentralization as a means to achieve high-throughput, high redundancy. In a sense, this flips the decentralized notion on its head: use it to scale, instead of using for its unstoppable nature.”
