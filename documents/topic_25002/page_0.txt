Can I use MOPS and Vessel package managers together? I mean: Not every package supports MOPS (AFAIK), how then use MOPS for such packages that support Vessel only?

So, what can you generally comment about compatibility between MOPS and Vessel?

Oh, fro [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/mops-on-chain-package-manager-for-motoko/17275?u=qwertytrewq):

How far this compatibility goes? Is it seamless? Any underwater obstacles? Is MOPS therefore a complete replacement for Vessel?

AFAIK development on Vessel has stopped because MOPS is so much better. I would suggest you don't bother with Vessel anymore if it's avoidable
