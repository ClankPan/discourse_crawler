Dear All,

I'm reaching out regarding a question regarding the generation of principals from the canister for our users. Specifically, we're exploring how to generate principals unlimited for users, such as when a new user logs in with their Google account.

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or insights you may have on this matter.

Best regards,
Waheed

Hi @gladguy

Please take a look at [canister signatures](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#canister-signatures): you can derive a new canister signature public key for every user (and from that a [self-authenticating principal](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#principal)).

This is also how [Internet Identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/) or [ic-siwe](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe) approach the issue.

I hope this helps.
