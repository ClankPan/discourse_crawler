I have heard that the internet computer site runs completely on ICP but when you look it up it looks like it is using a cloud provider that is not listed as one of the data centers or node providers. Can anyone provide some clarification?

That is on chain.

Unitas Global is a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) company, not a hosting/cloud service provider. They focus on managing the network infrastructure of cloud, data centers, and other edge infrastructure. A kind of a company that provides service of routing optimization to improve internet performance. CMIIM

When it said hosted by: Unitas Global, it proves the website is not hosted on any popular web hosting provider (AWS, etc.), but is hosted by its own edge infrastructure.

So interestingly, this website keeps giving different hosting details for the same website after couple of refresh.

When you're unsure whether a website is hosted on the Internet Computer (IC), you can inspect the HTTP headers, which often provide clues, including a canister ID. If you find a canister ID in the headers, you should be able to access the website directly using this canister ID which gives you a hint about its provenance.

I cant get it to work. I tried the different headers but nothing shows it.

You need to check the requests that go to `internetcomputer.org`, the requests you have there are going to `ic-api.internetcomputer.org`, which is not on-chain. The devtools only record requests after you open, so if you refresh after opening you'll see many more requests.

That's because you're hitting different boundary nodes, which are hosted in different data centres.

So how would i go about trusting what I see when I inspect websites in future to be onchain?

You should select specific resources to inspect their HTTP headers. For example, you might find this  [tutorial](https://mkyong.com/computer-tips/how-to-view-http-headers-in-google-chrome/) helpful (I just picked the first tutorial from a quick search on the web). There are other methods to inspect HTTP headers, such as executing commands in your terminal.

As I mentioned in my previous message, the presence of the canister ID in the HTTP header serves as a hint. If you are skeptical or wish to validate this hypothesis further, you can conduct additional analysis. This could include verifying the provided certificate, cross-checking the canister information across various sources, or directly contacting the canister, among other methods at the top of my head spontaneously.

The question of trust is a difficult one when it comes to what is served to your browser. The header is a hint, but any server could send the same header.

You can run a local proxy: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/try-out-the-ic-http-proxy-a-leap-towards-decentralized-http/20357

This will reduce the level of trust you need to have by operating the HTTP Gateway locally on your own computer, but it's still very difficult to know for sure if a specific website is running through the proxy or not. This is something that we're aware of though and would like to find solutions for this in the future.
