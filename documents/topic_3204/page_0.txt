So I was directed here by my Support Ticket not even sure if that's good advice from support as I can't see developers helping with this one...

Today I moved my ICP tokens successfully from coinbase to my NNS app after creating my identity.

I went to Neurons > Stake Neuron > Typed my amount (2.5). After about 20 mins of the timer rolling around it crashed out.

I checked my ICP main account and I can see a transaction with my staked tokens sent to the staking address. But if I return to Neurons tab, it only gives me the options to "Stake Neurons" again! No Neuron ID or locked timer options, nothing.

Would anyone have some ideas on whats gone wrong here?

I'm sorry that you're facing this issue, and it's a high priority for us. The Zurich team was able to reproduce the issue and has proposed a fix for it. I'll work internally to make sure that your situation is elevated to the right people

-------------------------

dmd | 2021-05-11 15:15:39 UTC | #3

What is the address you sent from and roughly at what time did you try to stake the neuron?
You can recover this within 24 hours of the failed stake.

Ghost122 | 2021-05-11 15:22:20 UTC | #4

I’m having the same issue

**Update: official response for the team**

---

A few users have reported issues when trying to stake neurons. We have identified the problem and we are working on a mitigation. No action is required on your end and will be resolved as soon as possible.

My original comment (below) is no longer applicable.

Hello there.
I got the same problem as Jello... I will take the liberty of sending you the data of the transaction.
Please help.

I’m not sure if this is related, if I use Safari on iPhone, my page just refreshes of refreshes refreshes and refreshes. If I open it up in incognito mode, it works fine but I have to sign in again.

That could be another issue... I outlined here https://forum.dfinity.org/t/problems-with-iphone-loading-nns-ic0-app/3313/2

Make sure you are on the latest IOS version. Also close all apps and reboot phone,I  didn’t clear browser cache but they may work.

After staking I got a similar grey background (where the dials should probably be)
Is this related to this issue or could it be something else?

Update: My grey screen issue seems to be resolved.  The Neuron screen is now working and I can see my staked ICP dissolving as expected.

I'm having this same issue.  I staked ICP last night and had full functionality of the NNS app, but this morning the Neurons page is greyed out exactly like this photo.  The rest of the app works.  This problem occurs on my iPhone and iPad.  I have closed all apps on my iPhone and rebooted, but those activities did not resolve the issue.  I'll be eagerly following to learn when the problem is known to the development team and when a solution will be implemented.  At the moment I am confident this is just a glitch in the app and my neurons are safe and voting, but not being able to see this page or find help is starting to make me nervous.  I'm super excited about IC and Dfinity.  Thanks for posting this photo/issue.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-13 22:46:41 UTC | #16

How did you start a Support Ticket?  I would like to do the same for an NNS app issue.  I haven't been able to find where to go for support yet.  Thanks!

Have anybody heared any news on this issue? No update for days on https://status.internetcomputer.org/ despite them writing that they have identified the issue and just need to coordinate resources internally. Community being downprioritized?

-------------------------

Domingo | 2021-05-15 08:28:54 UTC | #19

Nothing new... still waiting either for the ICP or neurons to appear

-------------------------

Oleg_N | 2021-05-15 08:38:52 UTC | #20

Yes, I would like to hear an explanation of how staking problems are solved.

Does anyone know Dfinity developers try to fix this problem at the weekend too? Cause we can't see any action for few days on "internet computer status" page.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-15 15:03:03 UTC | #23

Funny you ask.

Actually we patched it hours ago but just updated status page 10 minutes ago... while we monitor.

It’s only because I saw your question that I realized... “I should broadcast it more widely.”

Thank you!

OmerCihangiroglu | 2021-05-15 15:06:57 UTC | #26

but still we can't see our lost icps. when we will see them in our wallet again?

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-15 15:14:29 UTC | #27

Still can’t see my neuron.... are we getting reimbursed or should neurone appear?

-------------------------

kblbn | 2021-05-15 15:19:49 UTC | #28

**Monitoring** - Internet Computer resources have released a fix and are now monitoring.
<small>May 15, 14:59 UTC</small>

Latest update. My issue still not resolved.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-15 15:34:51 UTC | #29

I misspoke.

Staking was not fixed. NNS Governance is fixed. 

That was my fault. 

We are still working on staking.

-------------------------

rsix | 2021-05-15 23:06:24 UTC | #30

Great does this mean when staking is fixed ICP will be back in my wallet , or will it show as staking ? 
Because right now it shows 0 and all I see is my ICP being sent to another address

-------------------------

rsix | 2021-05-15 23:18:51 UTC | #31

There is a new update did anyone get ICP back

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-05-16 03:58:43 UTC | #32

Nope, I still don't have the neurons I staked a couple days ago...

-------------------------

rsix | 2021-05-16 04:54:38 UTC | #33

Still nothing I didn't get a chance to select duration  just disappeared from initial stake

-------------------------

OmerCihangiroglu | 2021-05-16 15:03:39 UTC | #34

Unfortunately same here

-------------------------

erik | 2021-05-16 17:19:02 UTC | #35

After creating the wallet with IOS 14.4's own browser, there is no confirmation key to enter the transfer quantity, so you can only return or cancel it, as shown in the figure. This problem is common in almost all IOS systems.

Same here, 5 days already... :motoko_go:

-------------------------

kblbn | 2021-05-17 09:12:12 UTC | #38

I'm on the same boat.

Nothing to do but wait patiently for a fix.

Every transaction is recorded so no funds will be lost.

Try to relax.

-------------------------

Enkito | 2021-05-17 14:58:47 UTC | #39

So I should wait with staking?

-------------------------

criptoslav | 2021-05-17 15:13:58 UTC | #40

I already staked, worked for me, web app only freeze on iPhone/Safari when I go to single neuron page, that started happening after first votes showed in voting history, ...

-------------------------

Enkito | 2021-05-17 15:45:06 UTC | #41

I want to stake also some icp. How many should i start with? How do I transfer my icp from binance to nns?

-------------------------

OmerCihangiroglu | 2021-05-17 15:46:53 UTC | #42

I staked small amount of icps successfully by way of Neurons >Stake Neuron>(I’ve seen “Set Dissolve Delay”)>Confirm Dissolve Delay Increase + Yes I’m sure. I done with this way.

 But in this tutorial video of DFINITY Foundation's official Twitter account: https://twitter.com/i/status/1390761036647596033 (Starting at 4:20) Showing us by way of ICP section>New Transaction>Stake. with this way of staking I couldn’t see "Set Dissolve Delay" section and likely 10 mins later page crushed and i lost all of my icps. 

I wrote this message just for to inform you about me and same experienced users situation. Thanks for your interest.   

@diegop @kpeacock

-------------------------

criptoslav | 2021-05-17 15:47:14 UTC | #43

if you already create identity then login into nss web app and on first page/tab named "ICP" you will see your main account address, probably saying 0.00 ICP, this is your address to which you need to send funds.

-------------------------

Ghost122 | 2021-05-17 16:16:32 UTC | #44

Yeah mine still doesn’t show that I staked on the neuron page.

-------------------------

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-05-18 20:10:44 UTC | #46

I wonder if we have any further update here, besides what's on the [IC status page](https://status.internetcomputer.org/)? I'd love to start staking, but obviously want to make sure everything is working as intended.

-------------------------

Carrie | 2021-05-18 21:08:54 UTC | #47

Recently and affected user here. Did not know these issues were going on until after finding that there were issues. Hopefully this solve the issue for all newly attempted stakes, not just “previously” affected users

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-05-19 00:23:08 UTC | #48

Hello. Just wanted to share that I successfully staked ICP in a neuron. I did this using Chrome on my MacBook. Only noticeable issue was that my follower selections did not always register after being submitted. I eventually got it all set up though. I hope this gives you a little more confidence in the system.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-05-19 00:42:03 UTC | #49

Oh that's great - congrats, and thanks for sharing. Definitely gives confidence - I'll be attempting this myself soon too.

There is another update, not exactly related to our issue:
*Safari users can be locked out of their Internet Identity*
*Incident status: Identified*
*Support teams have identified the issue and are investigating possible solutions. We're advising users to set up multiple devices while we fine a more permanent solution.*
My "staking problem" happened with an iPhone (and Safari), was it similar in your case? In order to use a different device next time...

-------------------------

ICPNorway | 2021-05-19 07:23:07 UTC | #52

Safari on iPhone here as well

-------------------------

OmerCihangiroglu | 2021-05-19 16:07:09 UTC | #53

They solved. check your nns account. i saw my icps now. you can disburse your icps too!

-------------------------

Domingo | 2021-05-19 16:53:44 UTC | #54

It has been solved in my case as well

-------------------------

ICPNorway | 2021-05-19 17:54:16 UTC | #55

Fixed for me as well🙏🏻

-------------------------

Carrie | 2021-05-19 20:10:57 UTC | #56

I got the text that says that it’s been fixed, but nothing has changed for me.

-------------------------

Domingo | 2021-05-19 21:56:54 UTC | #57

Try to check with another device, iOS/Safari is not the best way to manage the neuron.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 00:57:24 UTC | #58

On safari (iPhone12 pro) a big grey box appears under neurons, you can click on the grey box and it will load and show your Neuron id unlocked. It gives me two options increase dissolve delay or disburse.

 Can I re lock my neurons by increasing dissolve delay? 

How do I add more ICP to my current neuron ID? We really need some decent instructions on this.

Or should i disburse my current stake back to my walled and restake?

Looks like my neurons are showing correctly now so no more grey boxes :)

My ICP tokens are displayed in the wallet staking like this. Is it normal?

-------------------------

Ori | 2021-05-20 20:25:23 UTC | #60

That’s just the UI showing the figures on top of each other. It doesn’t affect your tokens in any way.

If your browser lets you zoom out they should display more clearly, or you could turn your device to landscape mode.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 20:59:44 UTC | #61

Yes zoom out works best! Top left in address bar on iphone “aA”

-------------------------

rsix | 2021-05-21 00:18:03 UTC | #62

It's fixed for me 
Set dissolve to 8 years !

Hi There, 

I'm still having the same issue with the Neurons Tab within the NNS App. 
I've tried to zoom in zoom out, login logout etc. to get rid of the grey/beige screen but nothing works! 
Can someone tell me how you resolved this issue? 

I'm logging in from an IPhone on Safari. 

Your feedback is much appreciated. :raised_hands:

-------------------------

Domingo | 2021-05-23 18:39:22 UTC | #65

Let’s say it happens to me 4 over 5 times when I try. iPhone/Safari as well. Most of the times (~80%) I get the grey screen, so keep trying...

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-23 22:09:53 UTC | #66

Yep you just have to keep trying, close all my tabs, login logout, press the grey box then back a page and reload. Usually something works

**Hello, so far I am a BIG Internet Computer fan but I gotta say---after the ease of Coinbase and Kraken w Staking, this Dfinity Staking process is extremely challenging. Not sure it is worth the Herculean effort. I am holding ICP w Coinbase and was hoping to stagger staking (x amt each year up to 8 years, for ex) but this is a hassle.  Please let us retail folks know if you release a separate user friendly version. I think the interest in Staking will really take off. Thanks very much in advance.**

kikokiko | 2024-02-06 04:48:25 UTC | #74

Hello. I'm currently having an issue with staking SNEED. I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask this but I already have 1 neuron for staking my SNEED on the NNS and I was going to create another one. I was sending 1 SNEED to create another neuron but I made a mistake and closed my browser window on accident while it was sending. The transaction completed but I don't see another neuron up for it. Is there anyway I can get that back somehow? Is it just slow or is it going to be stuck in limbo? I do have the transaction that's on the NNS. I hope that I didn't lose it. I'm thinking if what was said above of doing nothing and just waiting still applies. If anyone could help/educate me on this it would be greatly appreciated.

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-02-06 15:36:28 UTC | #75

Hi @kikokiko ,

We have a background job to claim that neuron in those cases. You need to go to the neurons page of the SNEED, where you have your other neuron and wait a bit.

If you have already done that and no other neuron appeared, let me know and I'll take a look at that background job.

Thanks!

-------------------------

kikokiko | 2024-02-07 03:57:12 UTC | #77

Sorry I just want to make sure I quoted you (still getting used to posting on the forums). Thank you very much for the help. I have sent you a DM.

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-02-07 11:00:55 UTC | #78

Thanks!

I reply here as well for visibility.

I was able to replicate the problem and we are working on a fix. I hope it will be part of the next Upgrade Proposal of the NNS Dapp.

-------------------------

kikokiko | 2024-02-08 00:40:19 UTC | #79

Thank you so much for the help and update lmuntaner. I hope the proposal passes as well. You and the team are amazing. I will be patient and wait to see the results.

-------------------------

kikokiko | 2024-02-08 00:42:42 UTC | #80

I do have one more question. Say it doesn't end up passing. Do I just have to wait longer for it to pass or is there some other alternative? I thank you for being patient with me (I'm still a noob with the IC and still have much to learn lol).

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-02-08 06:45:14 UTC | #81

If the proposal doesn't pass, I would be able to help you in another way.

I'd rather wait so that you can confirm that the bug is fixed and no other users will face it.

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-02-12 10:23:42 UTC | #82

Hi @kikokiko 

The NNS Dapp was upgraded.

Could you check out again and see if the neuron appears?

Go to the neurons page of the project you staked the neuron, wait a ten seconds and if it doesn't appear refresh and wait 20 seconds.

That should be time enough.

Let me know how it goes!

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2024-02-13 20:56:18 UTC | #83

Hi Imuntaner, I just came across a rather strange problem with displaying SNS neurons in EVERY SNS, of which I am no longer the controller. I sold some neurons using IDGeek.app This only applies to neurons created using NNS Dapp. Neurons obtained from airdrop or Launchpads do not appear. All these neurons also have the same ID. Is this a coincidence? How to get rid of it?

Some screenshots:

OpenChat
![OpenChat|690x330](upload://bWyBn4GQXRUnElwyffK743kHlNt.jpeg)

HotorNot
![HotorNot|690x332](upload://gVhST2WtAde83iBO7JPxU9DSIwp.jpeg)

SONIC
![SONIC|690x328](upload://gMeftKdc2bWp2LFPf9wprQPHN7s.jpeg)

My principal ID doesn't have any privileges for these neurons, but they are still displayed.
Neuron ID for these SNS's is: 077b3a342c54248d4a1b27b18f5e7629c86c520766887ae822ce1a4622e479ce


The neurons appear after about 10 seconds, not immediately like when I was their controller. Since I still control the SNS-1 neuron with the same ID, it is displayed immediately as before. And now the question: why does NNS Dapp detect these neurons? Are they somehow related to my controller even after completely changing it? Let me know what you think!

Edit:
Shows in voting too

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-02-14 07:20:01 UTC | #84

Hi @krzysztofzelazko 

Could you send me your principal by DM?

I'd like to compare that with the controller of the neuron to understand where the issues comes from.

Another question: You said you sold the neurons with the id "077b3a342..." is that correct?

The other Neurons' Fund neurons are expected, right?

Thanks!

-------------------------

kikokiko | 2024-02-23 23:46:20 UTC | #85

First of all, I am very sorry with the late response. I went to check and it's all good now. Thank you so much to you and the DFINITY Team for everything you all do.
