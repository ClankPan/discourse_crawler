### ECDSAKeyIdentity Release

Adds a new identity built on the SubtleCrypto API. This identity can be built using a non-exportable KeyPair and stored securely in IndexedDb for heightened security of your application.

Also, includes a first PR from [@rvanasa](https://github.com/rvanasa), a new team member at Dfinity. It improves backwards compatibility for compiling `@dfinity/agent` by removing BigInt exponents from the codebase
