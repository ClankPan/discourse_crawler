What system are you running this on? Windows with WSL2?

first i try to do it on wsl 1 and error, then i try it on wsl 2 still error

Yeah, sorry, then I can't help much. The replica doesn't properly work on WSL because it simply doesn't support certain expected Unix functions. We hope to get it running properly on Windows by replacing the replica with PocketIC , but until then it doesn't work
