About:

Hello, my name is Marcus Duke I'm the executive director of a local non-profit  we have been in business since 1996 out of Milwaukee Wisconsin in 2016 I won the BET award for my community service working with gangs. In 2019 I started out on a journey to build out a community business directory for the 2020 for the DNC convention in Milwaukee Wisconsin however covid wrong everything to the end, so in late 2021 I pivoted the project rebranded it as mycitychannels.com. and worked on making it a global DeFi Marketplace. In 2023 I rebranded it again as channels.biz.

#CHANNELS Revolutionize the way urban cities connect and engage with AI-powered Web3 DeFi ChatGPT SmartSite Technology through channels.biz (http://Channels.biz), a global business directory and marketplace for any person, place, or thing, powered by MCC Tokens.

I stumbled up on this technology several days ago and I am blown away by its potential and how closely matched it is with my dream of #channels.biz.

I had one goal from day one, and that was to turn #channels over to the community... after I figure out what I wanted it to really become. After finding this technology, reading, studying and listening to multiple videos, I believe this is the tools and ecosystem that we need to succeed together.

I would like to turn the complete #channels blockchain system over to the community from programming, designing, marketing, regulatory, distribution, security and all. And build out the internet computer largest SNS DOAs to date. 

I have a site that I built over WordPress I would like to move that site to the internet computer. www.Channels.biz I'm looking for programmers to initiate the move, code or recode the site, set up GitHub repository, program and code internet computer canister and more. I personally am able to code but no way am I a professional coder, I studied hard to get the skills I needed to build out my dream app. But I also know this will work best with an engaged community. This technology is pretty new to everybody involved but I believe it's exactly what we were missing with web 2. One of my biggest issues with web 2 was giving our content away, being forced to promote the product and forced to meet certain thresholds in order to get compensated for the use of our content. Only to watch them get bigger and richer. 

So thank you for allowing me in the community, I'm hoping you guys will take a look at what I'm offering and give me your honest opinion and feedback on how we can move this forward.

Thanks Duke.
