I have generated principal-id by $ dfx identity get-principal and attached to my github account. On page https://faucet.dfinity.org/principal-id if I click "continue", and go to https://faucet.dfinity.org/deposit, if I choose create new or use existring (giving Plug account address) is error "internal".
