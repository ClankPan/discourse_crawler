Hi,
Just saw the video where Olaf Carlson-Wee was talking about startups and internet-only businesses, just wanted to tell him, or anybody else - over here, there's this little site called Nanighar ( [Nanighar](http://www.nanighar.com) ), which is basically  Food Cooked By Housewives (as opposed to restaurants). This wouldn't have been possible without the Internet (though not Dfinity)! The website is in an absolutely DERELICT state - they could do with a redesign, and I'm sure they'd love some FUNDING! :) Any VC/bizguy out there wanna pick it up? :) 

When you do it, make sure they **take cryptocurrency** to pay for the food, will ya? :)

I am interested in information on refrigerators that are the best for food storage and come with a reasonable price.

And what is a reasonable price by your opinion?
