Hi, there :wave: 

There is a [new proposal](https://nns.ic0.app/#/proposal/79276) to upgrade the NNS Dapp.

The main new feature is a functionality asked for many users: to persist the proposal filters in the local storage. There is now a common way to persist in local storage, both the theme and the filters use it. Therefore, any other (non-personal) data that is susceptible to be persisted, can easily be persisted.

Apart from this main feature, it also has the v1 beta version of the DFINITY related dependencies.

If you want to take a look before voting, please go to the test environment here: [https://uywlp-pqaaa-aaaaa-aaa4q-cai.nnsdapp.dfinity.network/](https://uywlp-pqaaa-aaaaa-aaa4q-cai.nnsdapp.dfinity.network/)

As always, happy to get feedback about this new release and the dapp.

Have a lovely day!
