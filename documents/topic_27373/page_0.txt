When I deploy a backend canister locally, I am returned a candid UI interface similar to this:

http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=[canisterId]&id=[id]

In my `canister_ids.json`, I can see that:


```
{
  "__Candid_UI": {
    "local": [canisterId]
  },
  "backend": {
    "local": [id]
  }
}
```
This leads me to have two questions:

1. Why is `id` (which is the canister id) named `id` in the link?
2. I reviewed this document: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/candid-howto and found Candid UI id is the Candid identifier. Why does Candid UI have an identifier that is different from the canister id?

`canisterId` is what `icx-proxy` (the thing that translates from browser requests to IC calls) uses to figure out which canister to forward the request to.

Candid UI is a GUI to make calls to canisters so you can test your backend without having to use dfx or a real frontend. `id` is a feature of Candid UI that tells it which canister you want to make calls to. If you load Candid UI without the `id` parameter, then you get to choose the target canister yourself.
