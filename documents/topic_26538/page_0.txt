# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/fed4316368b93245120ceb0596423c715bb31ff0/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c fed4316368b93245120ceb0596423c715bb31ff0
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **127031**
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov community RVM Reviews channel on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/33) 

Proposal ID: **127034**
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov community RVM Reviews channel on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/35) 

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @ilbert, @Gekctek, and @hpeebles.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @jwiegley and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here if you have any questions or suggestions.

SPECIAL NOTE: We had two new reviewers this week that I would like to highlight.  First, Hamish Peebles (@hpeebles) joined the CodeGov team and this was his first review.  Hamish is one of the lead developers for OpenChat, which is one of the most successful apps running on the ICP.  It makes sense that project teams in the ICP ecosystem would be interested in reviewing the changes that are rolled out each week.  We are honored that he decided to help the CodeGov team perform the work we do.  Second, Ethan Celletti (@Gekctek) has decided to start performing a full review of Replica Version Management proposals.  Previously, he was performing only IC-OS Verification, but he now has time to dive deeper into the commits.  We are very excited to have both Hamish and Ethan participating in these reviews moving forward.
