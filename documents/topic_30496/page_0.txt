Will it ever be possible of the same wallet identity to merge 2 neurons with different controllers.  I have a neuron that I staked before getting a hardwallet  that I would like to merge to a hardwallet controlled neuron.

Many other would love to do this

Unfortunately, you cannot change the controller of the neurons. However, this has been a [discussion point](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-permit-transfer-of-neuron-ownership/15841) in the past.

Thatâ€™s unfortunate I really want to merge my neuron to a Hardware controlled Neuron.

Will this ever be considered ?
