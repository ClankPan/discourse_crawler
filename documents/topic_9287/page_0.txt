**Interoperability** is the ***future*** of blockchain. It deserves it’s own topic on the Dfinity forum.

There have been discussions around the Internet Computer and Interoperability —

> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-adopt-the-namespaced-interfaces-pattern-as-a-best-practice-for-ic-developers/9262?

 — but creating a topic will hopefully focus discussion and prompt further development.

From my understanding, iBridge is a crosschain dAPP in development (https://www.ibridge.pro/) — and there could be more such projects.

We must remain steps ahead of Polkadot and Cosmos — or perhaps forge alliances. For example, **if we forge a partnership with *Quant Network* (*$QNT*), we would be unstoppable in the future.**

IC has unique technology, unimaginable potential. We must keep the flame alive so it may grow into the forest fire we are.

I’m an idiot — but thankfully one that’ll admit it. 

ICP is integrated with Bitcoin. It’s working to integrate with ETH.

Interoperability ***is*** indeed coming.

🥳🥳🥳

To be clear, ICP has not yet integrated. That is still a work in progres, but has made significant strides.
