I know there have been a few updates to the dfinity.org corpsite recently - just wanted to say that this is my favorite so far. Love the clean white background, layout updates, and especially the animation behind the purple logo! :purple_heart: Thanks for all those that helped with this upgrade :+1: 


How do you all feel about the new dfinity.org site compared to previous iterations?

[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]
* Like it more than all the previous versions
* I like it more than the previous version, but I liked the older corpsite with the black background more
* Neutral, about the same
* This is my least favorite iteration
* Not important/I don't even notice when the corpsite changes
