I have done a port of auth-client for Rust web frameworks!
(an example of use for Leptos is also included.)
If interested, please give it a try and let me know what you think about the improvements.

After improving the documentation, tests, etc., if there are no problems from Dfinity's point of view, I'm thinking of releasing it on crates.io.

Nice project! In addition to building "regular" web apps with frameworks like Leptos, I imaging you could do really nice apps using things like ratatui in the browser.

I'd like to see a Ratatui based token swap using this library! :)

It's a crazy geeky and interesting UI ðŸ˜‚.
Happy to help expand IC into the world of Rust UI! (Tauri, egui, Bevy, etc...)

Dioxus is also very active. Some products use Dioxus. It is recommended to add Dioxus.

# Published!

https://crates.io/crates/ic-auth-client

You can use it by adding the following dependency to Cargo.toml.

```toml
ic-auth-client = "0.1"
```

I will add more examples upon request, but issues and pull requests are also appreciated!
