[Release Notes | Internet Computer Home ](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/release-notes/)

## Summary
- Patch release for frontend canister (also known as asset canister or certified assets canister) code. 
- Recent updates to the asset canister that came as part of `dfx 0.11.1` release introduced two unwanted behaviors to asset canister code, and we're disabling both of them with this release:
  1. redirection of all HTTP traffic from `.raw.ic0.app` to `.ic0.app`  
     - HTTP traffic redirection will find its way into `dfx` in the form of per-asset configurable redirects in the upcoming `dfx` release
  2. support for `ETag` HTTP header (a mechanism to aid cache validation).
     - `ETag's will be back once we add more code to `icx-proxy`

I know those two issues broke workflows for some people, for which I'm sorry, as this slipped through the release review process I was conducting. We will be implementing measures to make sure this never happens again.

Happy building!

Arf, you still cannot use `dfx deploy` with Gzipped wasm :confused: 
(When the path to the wasm.gz is specified in dfx.json)

Sticking with version 0.10.1 then, but thanks for the hard work ! Maybe in version 0.12 :crossed_fingers:  :slight_smile:  :crossed_fingers:

0.12.0 will support gzipped wasm :)

There's an open issues you can follow for this: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/2357. I'm looking forward to it as well :)

Does this have the latest motoko updates demoed in the Global R&D?

-------------------------

mnl | 2022-09-01 16:19:17 UTC | #6

Features presented at yesterday's Global R&D are not part of 0.11.2 release. 0.11.2 is only a patch release to frontend canister code (wasm), there were no other changes in comparison to 0.11.1.

Looks like some of the features from yesterday GR&D are part of https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/releases/tag/0.7.0 (tho I don't know if that release includes all of the features presented). At the time of writing this message, `master` branch of `dfx` uses motoko 0.6.3, and I don't know/can't promise if 0.7.0 motoko will get included in next dfx minor release (0.12.0).  
- the best place to check for that information is go to `master` on sdk repo, and visit section [Unreleased>>Dependencies in CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#dependencies) 
- also search for pull requests by `motoko` keyword https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pulls?q=motoko

Nope, but you can manually download `moc` and put it in (if you are into patching or sufficiently desperate).

After upgrading to 0.11.2 dfx complained about duplicate asset keys. I removed the `CopyPlugin()` as described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/release-notes/#duplicate-asset-keys-are-now-reported-as-errors) and also deleted the /dist folder from my project. However, now my React application can't find the asset files including the main.css anymore. What is the recommended way for adding static assets now with 0.11.2?

-------------------------

It's difficult for me to say what's the root cause in this case, perhaps you can share the content of your: `dfx.json`, `package.json`, `webpack.config.js`?

The recommended way of adding static assets has not changed -- when you issue `dfx new xyz`, the directory for frontend project will contain `src/xyz_frontend/src` and `src/xyz_frontend/assets`. Webpack config file is set up in way which will bundle the content of `src/xyz_frontend/src` into `/dist` directory. Afterwards, when you `dfx deploy` your canister, `dfx` will upload all files in directories listed under the key `canisters.xyz_frontend.source` in `dfx.json` file.

-------------------------

Thanks for your answer! I created a new project with `dfx new <projectname>` and compared the `webpack.config.js`. The following line was missing in the config of my old project: `static: path.resolve(__dirname, "src", frontendDirectory, "assets")`. Added it in and now it's working again.

glad to hear you've figured it out!
