I'm following the tutorial to get free cycles from faucet and then check the cycles canister from a browser.  It doesn't seem to work.
I can get everything working from command line properly.  I can check balance, show principals, show custodians and controllers properly.
Also the authorization (for me its https://lhuiw-3iaaa-aaaap-aboaq-cai.icp0.io/authorize) is asking to give custodian to a principal that I don't recognize.  Is this expected or did I lose the subnet lottery?

I've since tried upgrading the wallet canister, and now I only see a blank page at https://lhuiw-3iaaa-aaaap-aboaq-cai.icp0.io

I was able to redeem the coupon fine and show a cycles balance fine from command line.  Trying to view the canister wallet from the browser doesn't work.  Viewing from nns app works after linking to the wallet canister id (not the identity principal id!)

Here's what I did to upgrade:

```
hosermage@LAPTOP-1RPE37PF:~/projects/dfinity/hello_world$ ~/bin/dfx wallet --network ic upgrade
Please enter the passphrase for your identity: [hidden]
Decryption complete.
Upgraded the wallet wasm module.
hosermage@LAPTOP-1RPE37PF:~/projects/dfinity/hello_world$ ~/bin/dfx --version
dfx 0.15.2
```

We're aware of the blank page problem but we're not sure if we get around to fixing it anytime soon. For now I'd recommend you stick with the command line. If you want to downgrade your wallet again, simply use the upgrade command with an older version of dfx.

When you sign in with II, you get a different principal for every domain you connect to. This helps with anonymity, but also means that in this case that you won't get a familiar principal.
