Currently, I am working on a DEX implementation.
The main point is, how can I know when transactions are made with sub account.

At the moment you need to query manually for every subaccount you're interested in. For non-ICP ledgers I could see that an endpoint could be added that summarizes over all subaccounts, but it does not exist at the moment
