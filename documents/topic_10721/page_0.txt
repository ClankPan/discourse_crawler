Just deposit cycles to the canister.

I have two guesses: either you're trying to attach too many cycles to the call or you're trying to make too many calls to the same canister at the same time

Ran into this issue this evening. In my case it was due to running out of cycles due to outgoing call cycle reservation requirements when performing a number of outgoing calls in parallel.
