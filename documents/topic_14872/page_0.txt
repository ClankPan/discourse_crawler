I am opening a thread to enquire about Dfinity's plans for increasing transparency, something I believe is urgently needed.
If I Google 'Ethereum Foundation board members', the first link I see is this one:
https://ethereum.foundation/about/board/
It gives plenty of details about what I have searched for.
Similarly, Google 'Cardano foundation board members' and this pops up:
https://cardanofoundation.org/en/about-us/
Google 'Dfinity Foundation board members' and you get nothing much. You learn a man called Gian Bochsler is a member of something called the Dfinity Foundation Council and he is also a founding partner of Origyn and a fund manager, but I can find little about the council otherwise. Who are the other members of this council? What are its duties and powers?
When I try to find what funds the Dfinity foundation owns and has allocated I hit another wall. In contrast, here's a clear account of the Ethereum Foundation's treasury: exactly what it holds in crypto and non-crypto assets and what it has allocated over the past months:
https://ethereum.foundation/report-2022-04.pdf
Is there an equivalent report for the Dfinity Foundation? Is there a plan to release one anytime soon? If not, why not?

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-15 09:37:21 UTC | #2

Here are details of the Web3 Foundation / PolkaDot's Board:
https://web3.foundation/about/
These are all their grant recipients with the current state of the project:
https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/accepted_grant_applications.md
Does Dfinity have anything equivalent? Is it in the works? When can we expect it to be available to the public.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-29 22:22:51 UTC | #3

Community members have asked in the past what processes Dfinity uses to allocate resources, and received no answer. The sense many of us get is that Dominic Williams is a bit of a dictator, but Dfinity's outreach heads have explicitly denied this.
I just looked at the reviews of Dfinity on glassdoor, and it was very concerning:
https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/DFINITY-Reviews-E2946049.htm
Aside from one troll whining about price movements, the other entries appear believable. All of them speak about the brilliant minds employed at Dfinity as one of its best attributes. And all of them without exception question the judgement, behaviour, priorities and management skills of Dominic Williams. 
I previously wrote a rather intemperate post after Williams tweeted about People Parties and a documentary being a way to solve the Russia-Ukraine war. I was incensed by such a flippant and misguided take on such a serious issue, and went off track into an unconnected subject. But the glassdoor reviews have confirmed my sense that Dfinity might have the wrong person at the helm at the moment. More than one former employee complains that marketing and HR are given short shrift because Williams doesn't understand their importance and treats them with near contempt. 
There is no way for the community to affect anything within the Dfinity Foundation. I do hope, presuming the glassdoor reviews are accurate, some senior members of Dfinity will at some point stage an intervention to right the ship.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-30 04:34:57 UTC | #4

I usually don't trust Glassdoor's reviews cause they can be easily fakes and considering how much ICP is hated its not far fetched to think a FUDer wrote them, but in this case I tend to believe some of them as they reflect the same stuff an ex Dfinity dev told me a few months ago: good vision, excellent team, bad management. 

Now obviously this is very anecdotal and it might be the result of his own personal experience, but when combined with the reviews it creates a plausible idea of Dfinity's internal issues.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-08-30 01:45:06 UTC | #5

I don't agree with some of the decisions that Dfinity makes. I do think that marketing is lacking, in the traditional sense. I have gotten definite feedback, for example, from @jwiegley , in this forum that he didn't completely agree with the proposal 48623; but he felt compelled to carry it forward. 

That all said, i do think that it is quite admirable for Dominic to carry through with his vision for IC despite all the negativity post launch. A year + since launch, i can see how IC really is an existential threat for some other crypto-coins. Perhaps the decision was taken to look forward to designing the best tech and let the work speak for itself.

The team consists of world-class cryptographers; who can easily find employment elsewhere. Yet most of them have chosen to stay at Dfinity. That counts for something.

As my old boss would say, software development is not a complete democracy.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-30 03:55:20 UTC | #6

Absolutely, it counts for a lot. But do take a look at those reviews (sign-up needed) some are very detailed and all the credible sounding ones have exactly the same pattern. It might be that no former employee of Dfinity foundation has written reviews at all, and these are all fake fud-spreaders, but for each organisation reviewed one would have to assign a certain probability of a review being fake and for *all* of them to be fake seems unlikely. And all say the exact same thing.
And look at how we perceive the foundation's work from the outside: Williams tweets about People Parties, and it's made a huge priority within Dfinity. He writes a Medium post about maturity modulation and resources get directed towards what the community considers an ill-thought idea, which nevertheless passes thanks to Dfinity's voting power. There is a consensus in the community that Dfinity's marketing sucks and the reviews tell us why that may be so. The features described in the reviews match the features we see as outside observers, and the features we learn anecdotally from acquaintances. 
Some transparency about decision-making could clear the air. Who is on the Foundation Council? What are their duties and powers? What is Dfinity's road map to decentralization of its own functioning? What amount of non-crypto assets does the foundation hold?

sorry, this passed due to DFinity's voting power?

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-30 11:49:18 UTC | #8

Yes it did. They held the big guns back because they were unnecessary and used the bare minimum required, but look at how the vote went and it become obvious it was a co-ordinated insider vote. Community neurons, you will notice, voted against.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-08-30 11:59:23 UTC | #9

There were around 5 large yes votes and 5 large no votes (two of which have been confirmed as community neurons.)  

Neither the DFinity Foundation or the ICA voted.  Sorry I don't follow your logic.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-30 13:26:35 UTC | #10

A number of large neurons belong to Dfinity insiders. They ensured the vote was in favour, the close calibration is pretty apparent and has happened in other instances as well. If the community neurons had the votes they have now, the Dfinity Foundation would have had to step in, which it certainly would have done. Essentially, the entire point of the exercise was to save Dfinity insiders from paying taxes on maturity, they didn't even make a secret of it.
As for the vote, it is enough for me to note that on the forum thread and in community neuron votes opinion was stacked against the change, and yet it went through. If you want absolute proof that insiders tilted the vote, I cannot provide it, because there is little transparency around neurons, which is a good thing since most are private individuals. I will settle for more transparency from the foundation.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-09 01:08:47 UTC | #11

I'm not sure you are making a very strong argument using this [proposal 47820](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/74820) as an example.  The total voting power cast was 28.1% and DFINITY/ICA own 21.8% total voting power.  If they would have voted, that amounts to 49.9% total voting power cast, which is consistent with the total voting power that is typically cast on a Governance proposal.  

DFINITY has often held back from swaying the outcome of a Governance proposal when they generate the deliberation/proposal.  So it is normal for them to intentionally let the community make the decision by not voting.  People who are active in governance participation, especially on proposal topics they care about, have been known to vote manually instead of letting their Followee vote for them.  I would not be surprised if people who normally follow DFINITY decided to vote manually because they suspected DFINITY would not vote on that proposal.

Hence, based on my understanding of voting patterns I would not be able to conclude that DFINITY chose to partially vote with some of their neurons.  I just don't think the data supports that hypothesis.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-09-09 14:35:34 UTC | #12

@wpb , fair enough, since we have no data on who exactly voted, it is not a strong argument. But of all the issues I have raised in this thread, it is an almost irrelevant one. I continue to believe that insiders voted in favour and, had that been insufficient, Dfinity would have stepped in because the entire proposal was geared towards helping Dfinity insiders, any others who were helped was a side effect. BUt I can see why others may not have the same viewpoint. 
The questions I am seeking answers to are:
Who is on the Dfinity Council?
What are its duties?
What is Gian Bochsler's role in the Council and Foundation?
Where is the list of all grants provided by the Dfinity Foundation?
What does Dfinity's 5 year and 10 year internal decentralization roadmap look like?
I have a few other questions, might put them out if these get answered.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-09 15:51:20 UTC | #13

These seem like reasonable questions to be asking.  I hope you are successful at getting answers.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-09-30 04:50:07 UTC | #14

Although nobody has bothered to answer any of the questions I have posed regarding transparency within the Foundation, here is one more: which projects do Dfinity employees and specifically Dominic Williams have a stake in. It is clear that some projects like Open Chat have gained a lot of attention at the top while others have never been mentioned in any Dfinity communication. Recently, Williams tweeted about a Uniswap front end innovation, posted about it on the ICP reddit and also on the Ethereum reddit, where he spent a lot of time responding to various trolls. His interest in that project seems rather disproportionate, but maybe it was just the way he was feeling on the day. At any rate, the community ought to know whether Dfinity employees have stakes in any projects hosted on the IC, because there is a lot of potential for conflicts of interest there.
The earlier questions I asked were, to reiterate:
Who is on the Dfinity Council?
What are its duties?
What is Gian Bochsler’s role in the Council and Foundation?
Where is the list of all grants provided by the Dfinity Foundation?
What does Dfinity’s 5 year and 10 year internal decentralization roadmap look like?
What precisely are the Dfinity foundation's fiat holdings?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-30 08:28:10 UTC | #15

How many ICP Dfinity have to sell every month for?:
270 employees
Support all projects, grants?
Operation expenses?
All partys and dinners posted on internet?
How many ICPs rewards Dfinity (insiders and affiliates) are getting per month and how many are sold?
How many ICP are getting sold for these useless lawsuits?

Do they have a financial controller that really take care of the finance and make sure expenses are maximize for benefits?

Could that be the reason for the downward price pressure, and not raw inflation?

Of course, I do not expect any answer.   This is why we need to have SEC or some other official to jump in and force those disclosures, just as any other public companies are doing.  Dfinity have created a token with value sold to public.  Should be treated as a public company to protect investors and developpers.
I became to that conclusion by experiencing Dfinity total lack of transparency.  Now I understand the necessity of it.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-09-30 10:28:45 UTC | #16

I am pretty sure Dfinity is paying staff mainly through its fiat holdings and not by selling spawned maturity. It would be insane to do the latter at current prices. But it would be good to know, as we do for the Ethereum foundation, what Dfinity's fiat reserves are, so we have a good idea of how far it can continue to make payroll if prices stay low for years. This is information we know about any listed company, so I don't understand why a non-profit is not disclosing it. 
I think the best route now facing this stone wall is to make enquiries with Swiss authorities about what kind of disclosures are required by Swiss-registered non-profit foundations, maybe that will get somewhere.

Hi there!

While I'm a huge advocate for transparency for all entities that hold decisional power, quite a few of your questions are answered by Swiss regulation regarding not for profit foundations. [These entities are governed by a foundation council not a board of directors like for profit companies.](https://www.companyformationswitzerland.com/open-a-foundation-in-switzerland) The law requires that this council include a Swiss representative. The duties and powers of the council are very concrete and determined by the legislation and strictly supervised by the supervisory authority in Bern. In fact, not-for-profit foundation (especially those that deal with crypto) are the most scrutinised and rigidly audited types of entities you can set up. The only type of activities that a foundation can do are the ones that serve their purpose, as stated in the articles of incorporation. The council members are also public knowledge and you can even get a commercial registry extract for this organization here: https://www.zefix.ch/en/search/entity/list/firm/1282996

We've gone through the process of setting up the [Open Internet Foundation](https://yggpb-iaaaa-aaaae-aafva-cai.ic0.app/), a swiss not for profit as well, that funds and supports [distrikt](https://az5sd-cqaaa-aaaae-aaarq-cai.ic0.app/) and to be honest, the whole framework and supervisory scrutiny is REAL. It is also the reason why we trust these organizations more than for-profits. There is literally nothing else you can do with the funds that a foundation holds other than fulfil its purpose, as declared when it was incorporated. 

I guess I just wanted to provide a bit on context and resources, hope it helps. 

Also, I totally agree that a transparency report would be welcomed!

[/quote]

I agree and I would add that all entities with decision-making powers should disclose this information, including named neurons. I've said this before, but it's not a popular take. Nevertheless it would be a refreshing change. I mean, we ask our government decision-makers to disclose investments in order to prevent a conflict of interest...how is this different?

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-01 02:16:23 UTC | #19

@AndraGeorgescu , thanks a lot for your input. I do disagree a bit about many of my questions having been answered by Swiss regulations. Perhaps one question has been answered, which is about Gian Bochsler. One can surmise he doesn't actually do anything, and is only there because Swiss regulations require a Swiss citizen on the council. One might also surmise that the Council doesn't do anything, it is only there because Swiss law demands it. But it would be nice to get confirmation about these issues.
For the rest, is there a place you can point to where information about the finances of Swiss foundations is publicly available, the way it is about for-profit firms? That would be super helpful, because that is the information we lack about Dfinity.
I have no doubt Swiss regulators are excellent auditors and keep everything above board. They do also have a notorious reputation for maintaining secrecy, though. Swiss banks were thoroughly audited for decades. However, that didn't help the cause of transparency at all, in fact they were for decades the go-to choice for the world's kleptocrats. 
But thanks again for the helpful pointers, I will definitely do my own research about getting information out of the hands of Swiss regulators. Would be so much easier if Dfinity just put it out there the way so many other blockchains do, wouldn't it?

What the council does, what are its powers and limitations is described in detail in the legislation and the info is easily found online. It’s nothing vague about it, the council is the decision-making body of the foundation and has both the right to engage the organization and the responsability of those decisions. The links I provided you with even show who has sole signatory powers and who has joint signatory powers on the dfinity council…

No because as far as I am aware disclosing specific assets and holdings is not a legal requirement for a private organization. It’s not a requirement when it comes to for profit companies either, because those too are private organizations. You can see public info like yearly profits but not details about what specific assets they hold. It may be different with publicly traded companies, they are a different breed altogether but I haven’t had experience with those. 

A swiss not-for-profit is obligated by law to provide detailed accounts and financial statements to a third-party swiss auditor and then to declare everything pertaining to tax to their canton’s fiscal authority. Any irregularities and they end up re-evaluated by the supervisory authority in Bern, fined and ultimately shut down. 

That being said, a transparency report is a great common practice and even though we are not entitled to one, it would be a great move by Dfinity because it would address a lot of these concerns.

So I would also love to see a clear report on who has a big stake or role in the foundation. That said it's only about a 6 and it won't become a cause of mine anytime soon.

So I looked up the link to the swiss federation's documents (which is only partially translatable) and opened all of the 15 pdf documents and found, besides Dominic, only 3 other names as signatories:

Waldburger, Cédric (board of trustees)
Niederer, Michael
Bochsler, Gian Alexander

my german is not good and i must admit to not having the time or inclination to go deeper, which would involve copying the text from each to a translator or figuring out batch pdf translation. 

it doesn't feel very transparent, but i couldn't claim that it is deliberately opaque either. there do seem to be routes to follow for the willing journalist or researcher

Hello @willguest ,

Did a bit of digging. Cédric appears to be apart of Tomahawk. VC - a seed round investor in DSCVR on Jul 25, 2022 (another notable investor in this seed round is Polychain). Tomahawk appears to be based out of Zurich, CH.

Michael Niederer no longer appears to be a memeber of the Dfinity board. I found this link on google which appears to show network relations to dfinity. (Please note - I have no idea, nor can conclude the validity of this diagram. But very interesting nonetheless)
https://www.northdata.com/DFINITY+Stiftung,+Z%C3%BCrich/CHE-189.770.146

Per the above website, it appears our own Dominic Williams (ILU Dom) is the chair of the board

Gian also appears in the above infographic as a still standing board member. (as of the most recent publication on 20JUL22) Gian appears to be the Co-Founder of the ORIGYN Foundation.

It is not a requirement in North America, but in the EU privately held companies are required to publish annual revenue data and balance sheets provided they meet certain minimum criteria (over 50 employees, I think).

I don't think it is the most pressing issue either, but I find Dfinity's reluctance to release relevant data instructive (and this involves not just the present thread but its history since mainnet launch). I have started to think of the IC as being controlled by a secretive organisation headed by an erratic leader invested with extraordinary power. However, great the tech, this is not the recipe for a successful decentralised public blockchain. I suspect that as the months and years roll on, the importance of transparency will rise from a 6 to an 8 or 9.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-19 04:04:45 UTC | #26

I am glad some eminent community members are pressing Dfinity to be more transparent. In a new thread on the Internet Computer Association, @justmythoughts  asks the following questions:

* What does the ICA actually do?
* How are they managed?
* Who is a part of the ICA and do they have a board and projects they are funding?
* What overlap is there between the ICA and DFINITY?
* What is the history of the ICA (how and why was it started, who started it)?
* The first picture of a person on the ICA website is Chris Dixon from a16z. Is the ICA an investor shell organization?

What surprised me most about the post was that community members like @skilesare and @lastmjs have no clue what the ICA does. I have been wondering, given Dfinity's silence, if there is a group of people who know these things which are not being revealed to the larger community for some reason.
It looks like everyone but an inner circle of Dfinity leaders is clueless about the structure and finances of organisations that received a massive share of ICP supply.

To reiterate my questions which have not been addressed by Dfinity despite assurances they would be:
Where is the list of all grants provided by the Dfinity Foundation?
What does Dfinity’s 5 year and 10 year decentralization roadmap look like?
What precisely are the Dfinity foundation’s fiat holdings?
Do any Dfinity leaders have stakes in dApps being built on the chain. If yes, which ones?

As a sidelight, I am watching the Treasury vote with interest, I have a feeling it will repeat a previously observed pattern. An independent Treasury would, of course, take a little power away from Dfinity and thus support decentralisation.

Thanks, @hshadab . I should have found that link, seems I can't even search websites. If that is a comprehensive list, I am surprised. The total seems under 5 million USD. I would have expected a greater proportion of the 200 million to have been handed out in the 1.5 years since genesis to bootstrap adoption. Maybe the answer lies in the community reward program that @LightningLad91 mentioned.
About your second point, my question pertains more to the decentralization of Dfinity itself and control of the network rather than the nodes programme. The end goal of Dfinity, as with the builders of any public blockchain, should be to get to a point where Dfinity is no longer needed. Its main task now, in a sense, is to gradually render itself obsolete.
Ethereum's philosophy of subtraction says it like this: "We attempt to subtract our power and resist the natural tendency of organizations to grow and accumulate power."
Obviously, Dfinity is the lynchpin of the system right now and will continue to be so for the near future. But I hope it is planning for a time when it begins to subtract from itself. It is extremely difficult to hand over such a complex system to a community and yet if Dfinity in its present very centralised form stays in charge indefinitely, it will spell doom for the network. Of course founders will always think -- We built this, we know what is best for it. There will always be rational sounding reasons for retaining control.

-------------------------

Mr_Burkes | 2022-10-24 23:29:49 UTC | #30

I wouldn't hold my breath. Dominic seems to be a technical genius but one that severely lacks humility.

Dom, if you're listening, you built something great. There are obviously very smart minds working at DFinity, but it's obvious that something is being hidden for whatever reason. Is it control? To be able to control the network with your massive voting power? Is there a reason why you refrain from answering any calls for transparency?

We, as a community can take the reigns and start driving adoption. After all, what good is a technical breakthrough if it just sits on some sketchy node providers' computers doing nothing? Why waste this gift to mankind? Like seriously dude, just tell us what's going on. People will believe you if you say you made mistakes. It's ok to err- it's human.

The only way I can see for DFinity to save themselves is to come clean, admit their mistakes with a touch of humility, and hold transparency to be one of their highest virtues. Until then, the masses will not trust the IC and I see it being little more than an experimental platform. It's only a matter of time before others catch up. They have to move quickly if they want to stay relevant.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-10-25 03:14:10 UTC | #31

Sormarler | 2022-10-25 04:25:59 UTC | #32

More transparency is sorely needed. The more you refrain from releasing basic information request the more conspiratorial people will get. At least if you can't release the information, State the reasons.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-25 21:10:47 UTC | #34

Ironic innit? only goes to prove how much they care about transparency. IMO I don't expect Dom himself to come and answer this. I'd respect his time - considering how much R&D goes into building IC.

I really appreciate his talks on Token 2049, that's how I want to see IC presented to the crypto community.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-26 05:12:18 UTC | #35

A post on the IC reddit group asked about Dfinity's financial status:
https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/yc55ir/is_there_a_way_to_know_dfinitys_financial_status/

The very reasonable point made by the OP was they wanted to invest but needed to know if Dfinity could fund itself in the medium term. Strangely, the Dfinity team member's response was a link to this thread, where of course there are no answers to be had.
Usually, something about these matters leaks if enough people know about it. Since even the most prominent community members outside Dfinity seem clueless about the foundation's finances, it may be a closely guarded secret known to only three or four people. The question is, why would they choose to be so secretive? Maybe they do not want to reveal how much Dfinity profited from the high prices in the weeks after genesis for fear of angering investors who bought what they were selling.

-------------------------

I'm still curious about the kind of role and history of the foundation but, given its legal status, I would assume that a kind of freedom-of-information request would answer at least a couple of the questions floating around.

I'm also assuming that the Foundation is registered in Switzerland, but this is the relevant law which would inform a formal request: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html

In nearby pages, I also found the guidance "Please indicate that your request is based on the Freedom of Information Act (FoIA). The request must contain sufficient information to enable the OAG to identify the official document requested." and this contact.

I suppose the next step would be to determine which legal documents pertain to the formation of a foundation of the type of 'the Foundation', which ones may contain information that is interesting and then to request a copy. 

My prediction is that the findings would probably be rather bland, but it might be one route to bring more facts into the open.

Community Award Program grants were never disclosed. Now it looks like the program has ended and “Special Projects” would seem to be the replacement.

I believe the CAP program was ended. At least that is what it said the last time I viewed the grant page.

Hi Folks,

Diego from DFINITY here.

First of all, the wait for a reply has no excuse. It is poor communication on our part. We see that. I explained what happened below:

The answer to most of these things is quite boring with perhaps only one juicy part.

**I am not an expert by any means on this, but I will do my best and likely iterate/update as I learn more.**


# The Boring Stuff

1. No one has answered this thread for boring bureaucratic reasons. I myself report to R&D so I do not feel it is my place to reply. Same with Finance. Same with Legal. The task to reply was actually on the C-level's desk, but it just has not crossed the "super important" threshold they use for their time. They actually brought it up a few times in their exec meetings and at each they agreed to pen a long, thoughtful reply, but it never made the cut off with more urgent priorities. 

2. All the questions about team and board structure are supposed to be on https://dfinity.org/. My team manages that website along with https://internetcomputer.org/ To be honest, we have spent 99% of our team on [https://internetcomputer.org](https://internetcomputer.org/) and the documentation because that helps adoption.

3. Yes there is a board. It really is no different than other Swiss foundation boards. Dom and Gian Bochsler are on the board. Why is it not on the website? They are both in the "leadership" tab of https://dfinity.org/. Is it obvious at first glance? No, I do not think so. I take blame here as the new manager of the website team.

4. Yes, the foundation has all the paperwork, meeting minutes, etc.. of a Swiss non profit. Tbh, pretty boring stuff.

5. I think it's very reasonable for my team to improve the website for these.

## The "juicy" stuff

Here we get to the "juicy" or interesting stuff.

No, we at DFINITY have NOT published our runway and financing as of yet because it can be used maliciously. That being said:

* The initial financing rounds are [of course public.](https://messari.io/asset/internet-computer/profile)
* The initial [ICP distribution](https://messari.io/asset/internet-computer/profile) of ICP DFINITY received is public.
* The [neurons owned by DFINITY](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-voting-power/11801/2) are also public.
* The [number and names of team members](https://dfinity.org/) is public.

I know it can sound silly, but we have been advised that since we are living in a world of highly-financed bad actors launching surreptitious attacks and FUD, we have been advised to hold off on financing info. Yes, I can see that makes the financing info even more mysterious... but I will leave you with this:

There are documented examples of people playing very very dirty against DFINITY. You can understand our reluctance to reveal too much given how some have attacked DFINITY in a bad actor manner. One could argue that it made us too defensive, and that is fair criticism.

Will this change? We 100% expect so.... after all Ethereum foundation took years (after launch) to get where it is. Same with many crypto projects.

Quite honestly, I just rather keep working towards a world where DFINITY is not as important to the IC ecosystem, but my team can work on the “boring” stuff mentioned above.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-26 20:04:09 UTC | #41

I expect I will update the websites, threads, etc.. as team members of DFINITY answer some more of my questions in process of adding more things to the dfinity.org website.

I am not an expert by any means on this.

Let me ask you this - say, if I was close to DFINITY and I was an organization contributing to IC, would you reveal information to that me then? How do we know DFINITY is not close to ICPMN and pumping it? its clearly visible how DFINITY uses its media channels. Any comments on this?

I’m a bit confused.

What does this “pumping” ICPMN mean? ICPMN is a group of individuals (some of which are Dfinity team members). No different than other names neurons.

What does this have to do with the original ask about the board and others? Can you please clarify?

He refers to the connection that exists between some of the members of ICPMN and Definity by being employees.  I think it may have to do with conflict of interest.  Privileged information, contacts, etc. ICPMN claims to be independent from Dfinity and although it does not hide its 3 members from Dfinity, it obtains 10% of the voting power that together with the Dfinity Foundation have practically the majority in any proposal.  It doesn't seem very decentralized really.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-26 22:33:35 UTC | #45

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-26 22:40:18 UTC | #46

but I understand that a person has the right to a single vote, either manually with their own neurons through an entity such as an ICPMN member or through liquid monitoring

Jonathan | 2022-10-27 04:16:05 UTC | #48

At the risk of stepping out on a limb, I think it can be surmised that Dfinity is very solidly funded for contingencies for at least the next several years.

Combine what @diegop has said with a look at the [current job postings](https://dfinity.org/about), the size of the staff, the ongoing prize giveaways, and the amount of ICP the Foundation had at launch vs what is currently staked.

There's a very good chance the Foundation traded some ICP for fiat during the last bull run and made out very well in retrospect, which in my opinion would demonstrate smart financial stewardship of the organization's assets. But this would also open the Foundation up to "rug pull" accusations, which have already been hyped by bad actors.

There are plenty of reasons why I think this particular accusation is absurd, including those already listed above. The reputation of Dfinity took a hit regardless, and nobody wants to get bit by the same dog twice.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-27 04:27:09 UTC | #49


Thanks for your response, @diegop , much appreciated, and I have a lot of trust in your personal commitment to transparency and clear communication. About the Council, I wanted to know if it is just two people or more, thanks for clarifying that.
As far as Dfinity's finances are concerned, the central issue is the amount of fiat it holds. The ICP holdings are almost irrelevant for the moment and will be for the near future, because the interest from those will not suffice to pay Dfinity staff and grants for the coming two years during which we must assume the value of the coin will stay fairly low.

I personally do not buy the excuse that fiat holdings need to be shielded from bad actors. Unless there is something deeply worrying in the data. But I am not suggesting this is an excuse being used by C-level. Some of the ways the IC has been maliciously attacked have been made public. Others are probably known to the top staff but can't be revealed for fear of lawsuits.

Those that are in the public domain show that a certain billionaire who is currently very unpopular deserves every bit of that unpopularity. But they also show that Dfinity was extraordinarily naive in the way it went about the listing and its aftermath. I hope that, even though Dfinity has never publicly acknowledged its mistakes, perhaps because there are class action suits to be fought which would be hurt by such admissions, there is an internal recognition that Dfinity bears at least as much responsibility as bad actors in the debacle. 

We are now in a strange situation, where information cannot be revealed while Dfinity considers itself vulnerable, but at a point where it feels less vulnerable, the information will be irrelevant in practical terms, since at that point the ICP price will be worth enough to form a visible defence against malicious players, and Dfinity's ICP holdings will be worth far more than whatever fiat it might possess.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-27 04:36:39 UTC | #50

I also hope that, while Dfinity understands the costs of revealing information, it also understands there are serious costs to withholding information. While the information is hidden, potential investors have no idea about Dfinity's financial position except through indirect means, and therefore no way of gauging the network's medium term viability. Without such visibility few major new investors will make a commitment to the IC.

Also, @diegop , is there any barrier to releasing information related to conflicts of interest within Dfinity, specifically making public stakes held by high-ranking Dfinity employees in IC dApps and firms building on the IC?

DFINITY definitely very much aware. We know it is a painful, painful stand DFINITY has, and one of the hidden and under appreciated costs from all the bad actor attacks: it has made us more protective than we would like. 

Speaking for myself, i think the reputational costs are great, but still smaller than some of the potential attacks... I really hope this trade-off is reversed soon.

@esquivada Thank you for helping to interpret what @CatPirate may have meant.

Speaking for myself, I think ICPMN has done a lot for the IC community and they only reason they have voting power is because they were among the first to be named neurons in the early days (notably NOT the first, i think cycleDAO was first).  Nothing stopped anyone to become named neurons and they even encouraged others. 


*(sidenote: i may be wrong, but I think some cycledao voting power went to ICPMN via following when cycle dao disbanded, and that is the main contributor to the ICPMN voting power. I need to verify this.)*

I think in any protocol, if there are not enough entities representing, the solution is NOT to criticize the early entities stepping forward, but rather give them credit so we can welcome more.

Historically speaking... ICPMN was created after MONTHS of no entities stepping up into governance. Some times they even vote against what DFINITY votes. I think we should welcome ANY new entrants, as to encourage more. 

Anecdote: i once asked a big ICP person why they are not a named neurons when there were only a handful. They said,"*Why? I don't get paid and I see how the others get criticized."*

This is what decentralization looks like: encourage more entities, specially the early ones who came forward.If people do not like what they represent, they can stop following them. I think that is a fair shake.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-27 15:02:23 UTC | #58

I personally like ICPMN, I think they have good intentions.  But being pioneers gives the feeling of centralization.  Over time and with the creation of new neurons, IC will be decentralized.  Also, as you rightly say, the power of liquid democracy allows you to follow whoever you want.

I honestly do not think Dfinity has. If you have seen otherwise, that is something to remedy of course. I can of course be convinced there have been accidental actions, but I’m not aware of anything deliberate.

Hi @LightningLad91 , you can find info on many grantees for both Community Awards Program and Developer Grants Program on the [ICP Discord server](http://discord.gg/pMtZsNwpar). Once you get in (and have selected language groups so that more channels are unlocked), go to channel `_grants` and you'll see threaded list of many projects that have received grants from DFINITY. In those threads, you will find milestones, discussion between DFINITY team and grantees, deliverables (website URLs to events, articles, and videos, etc). 

In the current V1 of the Community Awards Program, a lot of content creators, media marketers, community organizers, and NFT projects have received grants. My team is in the process of revamping the current V1 and planning to launch V2 of Community Awards Program in the coming days. We'll make the announcement via a Medium post to explain how it works and what kind of GTM/community activities we want to support.

The TLDR version is that we'll continue to support two types of activities: **offline meetups** and **educational content creation**. V2 will be more selective, more simplified, more prescriptive, and more focused, with a more streamlined and well structured workflow for applicants. For example, a very experienced and accomplished Chinese IC developer is planning to create a series of tutorials and code samples on Github to teach Chinese Web2 developers how to build on IC, in a similar fashion as what [WTF Academy on Github](https://github.com/WTFAcademy/WTF-Ethers) has done for the Ethereum community. We're hoping the revamped V2 Community Awards Program can attract and support more such educational content creation initiatives.

Hope this helps.

-------------------------

zire | 2022-10-27 17:47:35 UTC | #67

No problem @LightningLad91 . By the way, I would be the first to admit that in the past, the way we managed the Community Awards Program was a bit messy. The previous team was very short-handed with quite a bit of turn-over right after Supernova. Many questions from applicants were left open for too long we didn't do a good job of responding. A lot of milestones in rear window didn't align well with the best interest for the IC ecosystem (in our opinion), or at least they should be more clearly defined with means to verify.

I was asked by the leadership team to take over Community Awards Program two months ago. My team is still short-handed ( :sweat_smile:) but we tried a few things:

- Disabled the links for NEW applications on [dfinity.org/community](https://dfinity.org/community)'s landing page. Existing grantees who have already received grants are not affected by this. They can still login and update progress. 
- Started working on the V2 of Community Awards Program as mentioned earlier
- Started an experiment to open up our communication with grantees completely to the public, via the newly created ICP Discord server. 

So the right way to frame up this whole thing is, we're not ending the Community Awards Program, but revamping that to a more prescriptive V2. My colleague Beeling Chua and I are in convo with 70+ existing grantees under V1 through Discord (which we welcome every ICP community member to join). Beeling does a much better job responding to many grantees and I'm hopelessly overdue on pending messages on all social media platforms :sweat_smile:.

There were actually more twists and turns internally in DFINITY about this program. I'll spare you from the gory details... At every turn, I should have written up a Medium post via DFINITY's official account and Diego about it (hey @diegop this is my shameless attempt to turn you into a verb... let this post be known that I'm the FIRST one to do so. Can you drop me an NFT for this.. just saying...) but things were moving/changing too fast for me to light up the path for all of us. My bad.

If you follow the ICP Discord server channel, you will find many CAP grants not only by name, but also with description, website links, milestone deliverables, and our back-n-forth communication with them. 

Honestly, I think we're probably running the risk of being too transparent than necessary (for Community Awards Program). It's hard to tell where the line should be drawn, but personally I tend to over-index on transparency as I totally agree with you this is extremely important for decentralization and the future of DFINITY and IC.

zire | 2022-10-27 18:34:17 UTC | #70

The OP @tsetse has a lot of legit complaints about the way DFINITY discloses info (or the lack of). OP also challenges the way Dom runs DFINITY. 

FWIW, I just wanted to say these:

* We have sufficient means to support the team. Nobody has missed any pay check. I think we're well positioned to live through this crypto winter. 
* In this fast changing industry where Aptos/Sui are catching up aggressively and Polygon/Algorand/Solana/Avalanche are full-steam ahead on their way of marketing, I feel very lucky to be part of the DFINITY team working on IC. I used to be a 3-time startup founder myself and used to part of the team that formulated startup strategy for AWS/Andy Jassy. DFINITY's journey, despite of its roller-coaster ride, is not that different from many other startups, who went from being widely misunderstood and ridiculed to transforming the entire industry and proving everyone else wrong (Jobs/Apple in 2003). We're far from being a dream team, but it's fun to work with a fellowship of strong believers. 
* Dom is not a conventional leader by any means, but he's our Dom. None of us would be here without his vision, innovation and tenacity. He's no Jack Welch or Andy Jassy. He's not a crowd pleaser but a fighter who will never back down. In my own personal experience with Dom, I find him very authentic, accessible, and actually more open-minded than I thought. As an employee of DFINITY and a believer of IC, I'm betting on him, and I'd imagine that's not that much different than how Apple/Tesla employees followed the torch carried by Jobs/Musk. He's made many wildly controversial decisions and many people will never make peace of those (or forgive him), but personally, I think he's demonstrated uncanny sound judgments on important P0/P1 decisions that really matter. 
* Many people tend to conjure up all kinds of conspiracy theories on DFINITY. Just let it go, folks. There is no conspiracy theory. We always want to run fast but often stumble here and there - all those are part of the growing pains. There is no Karl Rove. We don't have the answers to many questions faced by Web3 DAOs/communities and we're also just learning as we grow. The IC community has been a great source of feedback and learning for all of us. Keep up the fire! But let's not let the fire over-burn ourselves. We're all in this together.
* No, we do not favor ICPMN led by @wpb . We're trying to be supportive of all the IC communities around the world and rooting for the success of all of them. ICPMN is one of the earliest communities out there and they've been very vocal on many topics. This is a good thing.  Does it create an optics where we end up taking more often to ICPMN than others? Duh, naturally, yes.

You don't have to believe in anything I say, as I'm obviously biased with too many filters. I reckon that I won't be able to back up my above arguments with data and charts that are typical in an Amazon 6-pager, and I don't want to carry the burden to prove my assessment. But anyway, these are just some thoughts from one IC believer to another. Thanks for calling us out and hope this helps.

Yes, and I know this might not be possible because holdings are usually private. However, given the conflicts of interest that exist and are bound to arise in the future, I think some kind of policy ought to be in place where Dfinity staff reveal to the organisation any holdings of, say 10% and over in dApps, and Dfinity in turn reveals the total holdings of Dfinity members in dApps when these exceed 10%. No names need be disclosed to the public, just a statement like, "Dfinity staff own 27% of dApp X".

Ah good question. No such policy exists, that I am aware of.

I personally would support some version of it. For example, I would support dapps applying for grants showing any DFINITY members having equity in it, but would not support dfinity members to disclose their assets.

That being said, what is the problem you are thinking could be happening? Conflict of interest where DFINITY gives grants to teams where the folks who decide on grants own equity? Personally, I have not seen that come up, so it has not been high on my priority list, but would not be against anything that furthers trust in the network and the foundation.

@zire @Lomesh-dfn1 what do you think? You are closer to grants than I am.

Hi @tsetse I would have the same question as Diego. What's your concern here?

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-10-28 03:06:01 UTC | #74

Yes, @diegop , @zire , mainly grant giving, but also influencing votes that assist particular projects, publicising them more prominently than competitors and so on.

I want to thank @tsetse for raising these questions. They are ones I also raised several months ago, going through the exact same steps, finding (and translating) the same docs. I think like @tsetse, I was genuinely hoping to find some great answers, something I could use to settle my growing doubts and commit myself, my money and my dev skills to making ICP flourish.

I did not quite get the responses you have, and you did not get the pushback I met, and it gladdens me to see the community moving forward in this way.  I see similar shifts in people questioning other elements I questioned then, and being met with resonance, rather than an instinct to call FUD and do away with unpleasant cognitive dissonance.

But much as I appreciate @diegop's brave attempt at damage control (I feel for him in the circumstances) I don't think this long thread has moved the discussion forward one iota. It's been responsive and polite and "we are all friends" and "hope that was clear, let's just stop thinking about this now and get back to talking about how great ICP can be". But I don't believe a single one of your questions has been satisfactorily answered any more than mine. So having been reasonably gentle and watching the wheel come back round, and 76 answers later no movement forward at all (perhaps a couple of movements back) I ask your indulgence if I allow myself a little bit more emphasis and directness this time.

For all the tone of normality in the replies ("just boring bureaucracy"), the fundamental fact is anything but normal, and boils down to this: the great society-decentralising, trustless agent, Dfinity, has exactly 2 people in absolute legal control. Dominic, and a stand-in lawyer required by Swiss law. So make that 1 guy (and his token Swiss lawyer). 

![Screenshot_20221116_110744_Chrome|347x499](upload://vTTemZxROpz4DvUoYtRrGnMM1I1.jpeg)

1 guy. In total, absolute control. Can shut down Dfinity tomorrow. Can replace anyone. Can veto any project. Or shape it. Can implement a backdoor (not saying there is one, just speaking to the power of his position). A single monarch of Dfinity, as an evangelist of the utopia of decentralisation. Cognitive dissonance anyone?

People will shout "alarmism!" "conspiracy theory!!", but it is not. It is, to paraphrase Diego, a boring, bureaucratic fact. When you concentrate the power of the CEO and the power of the Board in one person, and your articles of association do not incorporate checks and balances (annual reports, financial disclosures, minimum board numbers, rotations, conflict of interest rules and registers, etc, etc, etc) you give absolute power to the CEO. When 1 man alone (and his token Swiss lawyer) is the board, the CEO and the Chief Scientist, without constitutionally mandated public information flows, you've taken a legal structure designed for accountability, and turned it into the emperor's new clothes.

"But it's a non-profit!" I hear a believer shout. Doesn't that make him one of the good guys - or rather the single good guy (and his token Swiss lawyer)? What's the worry about the concentration of so much power, influence and commercial intelligence in a single person, if they can't profit from it?

Well, here are some questions:
Who decides Dom's non-profit salary and benefits?
Dom does.

Who knows what Dom's salary and benefits consist of? 
I can't guarantee it, but I would be astonished, given the general approach to transparency, if anyone beside Dom and the token Swiss lawyer knew. What really matters, is that if Dom doesnt want to disclose it to anyone in Dfinity, he doesn't have to.

If Dom wants to fund projects he might derive a personal interest from, say via friends, family or proxies, could he? 
Why, yes, he could.

If he did fund projects he, his loved ones or proxys benefit from, would he have to disclose it to anyone, inside or outside Dfinity? 
Probably, to the token Swiss lawyer. That's  it. He wouldn't even need to tell the token Swiss lawyer  that it's a personal associate, just: "we're funding this."

Does anyone know if Dom has any ties to the early ICP rug pullers who made the billions? 
No one can ever know. We do know there is no legal, consitutional or administrative process that would lead him to verifiably tell us.

Is there one, single, tiny check or balance on Dom's ability to benefit from sole control of Dfinity in ways direct and indirect? 
Nope. As long as he doesn't obviously break the law, there are no constraints.

The entire philosophy of the blockchain is trustless transactions. Is it not ironic that the entire organisational, financial and legal philosophy of Dfinity is "trust Dom, he is a dom, but he's our Dom"?

You may think this is hyperbole. But this was precisely the answer to the question of legal, financial and institutional transparency that opened this thread.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/transparency-within-the-dfinity-foundation/14872/40

"we have been advised that since we are living in a world of highly-financed bad actors launching surreptitious attacks and FUD, we have been advised to hold off on financing info."

= "sorry, you will never know what goes on with our finances." 

That makes absolute sense and is pretty boring and conventional. For a small commercial entity. In some jurisdictions. Sometimes. 

(Shhh. Don't mention that there are of course plenty of businesses, including the biggest ones, living in a world of even better financed competitors eager to launch attacks and FUD. Who nevertheless publish their annual accounts.) 

There is a HUGE zone between "we will keep sensitive financial info confidential", and "we will disclose not a single fact about our finances to the thousands who have poured their savings and energy into our project". That HUGE zone, occupied by every listed company, as an example, and 99% of smaller companies in UK for example, doesn't exist for Dom, and therefore for Dfinity, since, legally and constitutionally, Dom's will, is Dfinity's will, no ifs, no buts. 

Who is the "we" and who is the advisor here? 

This model is not unheard of in private businesses. It might not get you a responsible business award or qualify you as a B-corp: but it's a common way of running a private company. But Dfinity is not a private company. Dfinity, for all the money it manages, the VC funding it attracts and the startup feel of its operations, is (meant to be) a non-profit entity.  Ask most non-profit foundations in the world (I run one and advise many): Dfinity's total lack of financial transparency, their one person governance, their absolute absence of governance checks and balances, is not good, or even normal, non-profit governance. 

"Yes there is a board. It really is no different than other Swiss foundation boards. Dom and Gian Bochsler are on the board. Why is it not on the website? They are both in the “leadership” tab of [https://dfinity.org/ ](https://dfinity.org/). Is it obvious at first glance? No, I do not think so. I take blame here as the new manager of the website team."

Nothing to see here folks, it's just a website issue. Should have added a mention in the about us link. Sorted. This is exactly how non-profits work. Boring, normal stuff.

Is it really though? Find me a multimillion dollar non-profit with hundreds of employees and complex financial operations, who has a single person on the board (and the token lawyer), who also happens to be CEO. It is pretty rare in the non-profit world, and they tend to wear shirts that say "I'm sketchy". To be fair to @diegop, this internationally extremely rare breed of non-profit tends to be found in Switzerland, for the same reason other birds of "sketchy" financial plumage are observed in that habitat: secrecy laws. 

" Yes, the foundation has all the paperwork, meeting minutes, etc… of a Swiss non profit. Tbh, pretty boring stuff."

Sounds normal. Apart from the fact that it is not really that normal, for the minutes to consist of whatever Dom (and his token Swiss lawyer), decide to write down. Do the minutes state any bonuses the board decides to award its CEO? Let's ask the CEO, who is the only member of the board (with his token Swiss lawyer). Do they state what projects money will go to? Who knows? Who cares? Who gets to read the minutes? 

If you were the only member of your company's board (with your token Swiss lawyer), how often would you arrange to meet yourself? How would you handle disagreements with yourself? Would you put it to a vote? I suspect those board meetings are, as Diego puts it, boring indeed, and very, very quick.

Asked by @tsetse if Dfinity are aware of the reputational costs of zero transparency, @diegop replies:
"DFINITY definitely very much aware. We know it is a painful, painful stand DFINITY has."  

It definitely must be painful to Dfinity staff sent out to defend the indefensible. And I am sure Dom is very, very aware. After all, he could have chosen any jurisdiction to build his non-profit. He must have searched hard and wide until he found the single most secretive jurisdiction that would legally entitle him to run a foundation as a sole board member (with a token Swiss lawyer) with absolute control and, precisely speaking, zero accountability.

But I don't think it's painful for Dom, let alone painful, painful. I think it's actually quite nice for him really. He doesn't even have to answer himself, because, as Diego explains, this doesn't meet the "super-important" C-level threshold. The current situation, for Dom, is a carefully curated feature,  not a bug. I have founded many non-profits, local, national and international. I have worked with over 1000. I can tell you that you don't achieve such lack of transparency and accountability, with such singular control over so, so much money, without serious effort.

Astonishingly,  Diego's answers did not end the questions. Some people bizarrely still wanted to know how to find out whether Dfinity was solvent enough to keep running, to decide whether to invest. Absurd right? 

@zire then chipped in.

"FWIW, I just wanted to say these:

We have sufficient means to support the team. Nobody has missed any pay check. I think we’re well positioned to live through this crypto winter"

Ah good then. Let's carry on creating our trustless system. After all, that was pretty much the same thing SBF said about FTX a few days ago, and it worked out for them. Wait.

"Dom is not a conventional leader by any means, but he’s our Dom... As an employee of DFINITY and a believer of IC, I’m betting on him."

So that's what the entire legal, financial and ethical structure of Dfinity boils down to: be a believer, gamble, and make Dom your dom.

Finance records? Who needs them to invest: 
Believe, gamble, follow your Dom.

Conflicts of interest? Who needs checks and balances: 
Believe, gamble, follow your Dom.

Unlimited authority? Who needs observability into the decision making process or even the decisions themselves:
Believe, gamble, follow your dom.

The problem, to close the circle and return to the origin, is that every single non-technical decision taken by Dom speaks to a lack of trustworthiness. Out of all the institutional frameworks, he shopped for jurisdictions worldwide until he found maximum control, maximum secrecy, and minimal accountability. He then oversaw a launch that displayed the fastest inflation of a currency, the buying of currency from his own employees, a set of demonstrable, universally acknowledged but still shadowy transactions that made people billions, precisely when 99.99% of investors were locked out and could only yearningly watch; before plummeting just as the lock expired at a rate far exceeding that of the wider crypto market and in rhythms that tracked precisely with the movement of ICP coins during and after the lock-in.

I don't think it's FUD ("heretic!") to question, in a collective endeavour to build a decentralised internet why Definity (ahem Dom) choses to structure itself as an uber-centralised pyramid calling the shots with a single man at the top with absolute no accountability and zero checks and balances.

I don't think it's FUD to question why in a beautiful project to achieve a trustless economy, Dfinity (ahem Dom) chooses to operate entirely on trust, or really, more accurately, entirely on faith in our benevolent leader (he may be Dom but he's our Dom), that requires everyone whose investments and life goals are tied to the project, to just say "whatever you say" to their Dom, particularly when Dom has not given any sign of being particularly worthy of retail investors' financial or institutional trust. Who needs an investor's trust when you can have a believer's faith? 

In closing, I just want to emphasise the key word in my last two paragraphs: choice. Dom is not tied by some existential constraint. No FUD goons are pinning Dom to his chair. In one instant, he could add seats to the board. Include ICP investors, creators, advocates. Literally in one instant. He could tell his token Swiss lawyer: please copy and paste the statues of 99.99% of non-profits and reword for our purposes. Voilá. Checks, balances,  accountability, and trust, for when faith won't carry you.

It would take an hour with a financial advisor to say: what information can I share without risking the future of Dfinity, ICP and the planet? And then ask his accountant to share it. It might actually take 15 mins of his time, since there is not exactly a lack of examples to draw on for public financial disclosures that miraculously have not destroyed the companies making them every year.


@diegop wrote: "No one has answered this thread for boring bureaucratic reasons." I think this remains the case. The bureaucratic reason of a non-profit with Swiss jurisdiction with a sole person of significant control, who has no interest in sharing with anyone any facts whatsoever that could curtail his ability to do, say, pay others or himself, exactly as he pleases, with zero external visibility outside of what he himself curates.

The ethics of it aside, and that's an unbridgeable aside for me, I don't think this is either viable or sustainable. I think, with the many fragilities around ICP ecosystem centralisation, node concentration and inflation, voting power concentration, acknowledged gaps in data protection, environmental impact of a costly architecture, and other tricky, but perhaps solvable stuff, the current institutional and legal structure, privileged and opaque information environment and Dom's unrestricted, unaccountable, secretive and ethically compromised position of absolute authority; coupled with the irrationality of crypto belief (as opposed to trust and verification); are existential risks that don't bode well for Dfinity, ICP, and specially ICP's investors (as if the devaluation was not enough indication!). 

I also think, whether Dfinity and ICP thrive, or crash and burn in the future, Dom will be just fine, and profit from the outcome. Leaders in his position tend to implode from the cummulative impact of character choices, not a particular set of logistics, and thrive until the moments before implosion. Just ask FTX.

I genuinely love the concept of the Internet Computer. I hugely appreciate the extraordinary brain power, innovation, creativity and community. It is deeply seductive, because I want to believe. I am perhaps somewhat shielded by the lack of a personal profit motive: I'm not imagining myself an ICP millionaire in addition to this wonderful project. 

But if I replace the urge to believe, with an urge to trust and verify, then I find this fantastic, inspiring structure resting on a foundation of cards. Probably bank cards. Probably Dom's and a small circle. Probably not (any longer) in ICP. And one character flaw away of taking the whole thing down.

I'd like to be wrong, and I'd check against the facts, if only one could, beside Dom. And his token Swiss lawyer.

I'd have upvoted this 100 times if I could, it's sad your initial inquiries were met with a poor response and since then you have moved to other projects, we need more people asking tough questions and less of the "It's alien tech" style of propaganda I often see in IC's circles.

Speaking of transparency I'd like to know why the ICA's VP has almost tripled since September and is the highest it's ever been, last AMA with Dfinity made it look like the ICA was kind of a failed or paused experiment and it didn't do much at this time, but somehow they now have 3 times the VP they had on the 25th of September (5.4mil to 16.9 mil).

justmythoughts | 2022-11-16 20:43:51 UTC | #82

Thank you for your much needed criticism of DFINITY’s lack of financial transparency in this current financial climate. 

Even if @diegop and DFINITY fail to produce any financial documents, hopefully people in the ecosystem read your thoughtful post, realizing that given the financial secrecy and single party rule of DFINITY, they are undertaking insanely high platform risk by building on the IC.

Maybe this is also why developers are having so much trouble integrating with traditional businesses - why would a non-crypto business take on that type of risk with their product or data?

Even if the “tech” is novel, the finances and ownership of DFINITY are a big part of the reliability and redundancy of the IC (even though DFINITY is **not** the IC).

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 21:02:07 UTC | #83

I have to say, it's amazing how sentiment and discourse have shifted in the last 8 months! I was stunned when I first raised these and more technical issues (see my post history) that they were somehow novel or unusual. And the reactions really different. On several threads now I'm seeing people return to these questions and the community engaging with them with maturity and seriousness. If anything bodes well for ICP, is the growth in these kinds of responses. It gives the system a capacity to adapt. When feedback loops face hermeticism at the top, and uncritical assent at the bottom, with the middle not minding, they essentially collapse, and the system quickly becomes maladaptive. Cognitive dissonance is a very useful warning system, to assist in course correction.  When you keep it at bay, either burying the information, or your own head in the sand, you're cruising for a bruising, in my experience.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 22:07:28 UTC | #84

I think the problem with this is the "because I feel". That is laudable of you, and as it should be, but it shouldn't be left to dfinity employees' discretion. What if a colleague does not "feel" they should not benefit from a project they decide to fund? What if on the contrary they "feel" like tipping the scales to benefit a friend, relative, or independent business venture? Conversely, what if you discover accidentally that a project you approved had one of your relatives as an investor? How would you protect yourself against accusations of self-dealing, in the absence of transparent procedures you can point to and say "see? I did things impartially, and awarded them the same as all the others, following our published and vetted process".

These things protect both, the community, and the people involved in awarding the money.

Is it? These are great tweets. Where are the processes? Where are the binding, institutional rules that would make non-compliance an enforceable breach? What if in 2 months' time he changed his mind. Would he tweet about it? What if he absolutely follows through: only buys Dapps publicly. Declares an acquisition. Does this cover acquisitions by third parties in which he owns a stake? He only holds ICP in his own name. Does he hold 10 other currencies through a company? In a trust? In a relative's name? Far more important, is there absolutely any rule in Dfinity that would make the above an enforceable breach?  What is your own instinct?

[Here is an example](https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/speakers/dominic-williams-cto-of-string-lab/). In 2017, Dom was both the head of Dfinity, and the CTO of String Labs. Dfinity raised c.$4 million then. In other words, Dfinity paid Chief Scientist Dom to raise millions to pay CTO Dom to work on products to enhance Chief Scientist Dom's Foundation. For a non-profit, it sounds pretty profitable for Tom. But it's a bit murkier than that. According to Crunchbase, String Labs raised a total of $5 million in from 6 investors in a Seed round. That's it. The round relied on Dfinity. But Dom's String Lab co-founder, widely advertised that String Lab received $25 million from Dfinity Foundation. And then it closed. 

So Dom paid Dom to get 6 investors to pay Dom $5 million, and then Dom paid Dom $20 million more from Dom's non-profit foundation. Did Dom make a profit from Definity? I'll let you be the judge. String Lab appears to be closed down. How did it spend $25 million? Definity god knows. And Dfinity god's partner, Tom. 

So forgive my scepticism if when Dom Tweets about his transparency, I parse his words extra carefully, and ask whether he intends to write down the same thing in anything more binding than a Tweet.

-------------------------

Well made points! 

Time and time again, it appears that Dfinity's lack of transparency is what is most likely to kill the project. The lofty goals of 'decentralising the Internet' are almost laughable when the above is considered.

As mentioned, why would anyone choose to build on a platform that sells itself as 'reducing platform risk' when it arguably offers greater platform risk (project failure, lack of transparency, law suits, untested engineering and blind faith in Dom).

All very frustrating considering the amazing team and tech.

I've been watching this thread develop over time, and sure it gets more & more interesting. Although I applause you (@leamsi) for pointing out the elephant in the room and I agree transparency with the foundation is an important aspect for sure, I'm not convinced it is as detrimental to the project (i.e. Internet Computer) as you made it out to be.

As a developer myself, I am more interested in knowing when or whether IC can grow independent from the dfinity foundation. It is unavoidable in the early days that a platform needs its original creator, but is the tie between IC and the dfinity foundation grow stronger or looser?

On one hand I see accusations of the foundation "dumping" tokens (to which Dom have denied), on the other hand I see worries of dfinity having too much voting power in NNS (which effectively controls IC).  But these two are conflicting opinions to each other, aren't they? If anything I'd rather see the foundation diluting its ICP to investors sooner than later, so that voting power can grow more decentralized.

Voting power aside, the ability to continue develop and advance the technology behind IC is also very important. At the moment the leading role has been assumed by the foundation. Are they doing a good job? Are they incorporating or rejecting community contributions? Are they holding onto the expertise or are they willing to share? Is there any other entity (with vested interest in IC) that can do a better job than the foundation? If there is not, why not? How can the community foster a group of open source developers for IC core tech without depending on dfinity?

I think these are right questions to ask, instead of lingering on the transparency issue of a single entity: the foundation. I for one has little interest in knowing how dfinity manages its teams, how much control Dom exerts on his organization, let alone how much he gets paid. The mentality of relying on a single entity for IC to thrive must change, otherwise it never will.

That is of course not to say, from a legal & financial stand point, DFINITY should not improve its transparency, or the questions you ask are not worth pursuing. I think they are important, but for different reasons.

It has become a common & dominating practice for crypto startups to not to have "shareholders". They effectively run token sales to raise money, but has no legal obligation to answer to tokenholders since they are not "shareholders". Dfinity Foundation is no exception. Other foundations may do better at financial transparency, may do worse. I don't really care if any of these foundations survive, what I care is whether the product they build will survive. A platform can only survive by being decentralized, both in how the platform functions day to day, and in how its future development is carried out.

I will be glad to see at some point the balance of core IC technology development tipping more towards the community. Are we on the right course? Does financial transparency help to stay on this course?

[/quote]

Ditto again for me. This is THE key sticking point for me in my due diligence before I can invest any significant time or money into the IC. The IC is fundamentally run by a dictatorship presenting itself as a democracy, and I don't see any clear sign yet that they want to evolve away from that. That said, I don't think it is necessary to ascribe any conspiratorial or deceptive intent behind this fact, since there are some significant theoretical hurdles to cross to achieve true decentralization. Also, many DAOs who have become mesmerized by the promise of Web3 make similar over-exuberant claims of being democratic when they are most certainly not. 

As I've stated in several other posts, real power resides in prioritization, which the NNS is completely incapable of. Such decisions involve a prioritized choice among competing alternatives, particularly when the allocation of scarce resources is involved. NNS approval voting (like in all DAOs today) is almost always just a yes/no rubber stamp on a single isolated alternative/proposal, since it is deeply dependent upon the priorities that have already been decided upon by those with the real power to allocate resources.

Choice is most definitely at the root of the problem - in this case, collective choice. Collective prioritization is a far more difficult problem to address than almost everyone imagines it should be, as I've highlighted in previous posts. It is the core topic of my upcoming PhD project. I've even offered to DFINITY that we collaboratively explore ways to cross this "prioritization chasm" as part of my research to make the IC as truly democratic and decentralized as it presents itself to be. However, I have heard no response to that offer yet, made in both public posts and via DM. If they are not even interested in exploring how they can achieve true decentralization, then that would definitely be a big red flag for me. The jury is still out, though, so let's not jump to any conclusions yet.

Again, I understand your frustration, @Leamsi, but I think it is a distraction to imply that the problem must be the particular dictator in power - benevolent or otherwise - rather than the system itself. No DAO that I'm aware of has adequately addressed this prioritization problem, let alone solved it, so try to keep that in mind. That said, I do agree that some mitigating measures around financial transparency and internal controls, with independent verification, would be very beneficial in the meantime.

Manu | 2022-11-17 16:40:32 UTC | #89

hey everybody! I would like to share my personal view here, more as a community member than as a DFINITY employee. 

If we look at other web3 projects, there are always companies or foundations contributing to them, and those companies or foundations are not truly decentralized. Some may be more transparent than others, but at the end of the day there is always some board that is in charge. However, what is important is that the project overall is decentralized. As the ICP community, I think we should focus more on decentralizing the IC instead of only focusing on DFINITY. 

I believe the lowest hanging fruit is NNS voting: DFINITY has 23% of the voting power today, but since many neuron holders choose to follow DFINITY's votes, DFINITY actually has an absolute majority on most NNS topics (if we include the follower votes). I think this unfortunate, because the IC's NNS is actually a super powerful DAO, because all replica software and NNS canisters must be approved by the NNS before they can run, so the IC is truly governed by the NNS. I believe we need to make sure that the NNS vote really reflects what the community wants. That way, there can never be any change made to the IC that does not have the support of the majority of the community. 

Some concrete steps we can take to decentralize the NNS vote better:
- implement "periodic confirmation": right now we have a huge chunk of voting power (seemingly 50%) that follows DFINITY on "all topics except governance" but still hasn't configured following on the governance topic, indicating that they're not actively participating. This group follows DFINITY today, so periodic confirmation would likely help decentralize the vote quite a bit. 
- encourage more community leaders to step up as voting neurons, and in particular encourage them to vote on more topics than just governance. I think very important topics are "system canister management" (which approves upgrades to NNS canisters) and "replica version management" (which approves new replica software versions, we recently split this off into a separate topic to make it easier for the community to vote on this topic). It is critical that the Internet Computer replicas and NNS canisters only run vetted code. Voting neurons can get the source code for the NNS canister and replica upgrades, ensure there are no unexpected changes in the source code or or git history, and build the artifact from source to ensure that the binary is indeed built from the claimed source code.
- encourage voting neurons to advocate their neuron more actively and to explain why they voted in a certain way
- encourage everybody to revisit whom they follow, and consider following community neurons instead of all following DFINITY.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-17 18:47:32 UTC | #90

I think NNS prioritisation is most certainly a crucial problem to solve. I have elsewhere pointed to the problems that stem from the huge concentrations of voting power. Liquid democracy is certainly liquid, but not democratic. Still, these are precisely the design challenges that make a project like this interesting and exciting: assuming good faith and capacity for influence. You have just pointed to your own need to collaborate with Dfinity to take your doctoral ideas for improving ICP forward. There is no need for DFINITY to take on your idea: they might have different priorities; different implementation philosophies; different people already working on it. But the fact that you would see a need to collaborate with DFINITY demonstrates the centrality of DFINITY in the ecosystem, even after renouncing a range of votes. And DFINITY is Dom. So Dom's ethics, choices, priorities and motivations **will** cascade down to systemwide effects. This makes all your NNS development efforts, even if successful, a hostage to fortune. I think we are a VERY long way from a scenario where Dfinity is just one more voice among equals. While the absolute executive, financial and technological control of Definity resting in one man, with not an exactly uncompromised track record, then, as I put it, all other development rests upon a house of cards. Dom's cards.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-11-17 18:54:56 UTC | #91

Afaik IC's code is not completely FOSS, so if Dfinity ever went rogue the community can't easily fork the protocol,  that alone should impose a higher level of transparency on Dfinity's end. The project relies on its good faith way more than others.

-------------------------

passio | 2022-11-17 19:11:09 UTC | #92

A good dictactorship is better thank a false democracy. Dfinity is made of most brillant mind in the world, probably with some of them working to change the world more than because the need of money. For this reason, I am not bothered by their large power on the network. The perfect democracy can't exist in this world... I saw many people and project who tried... if it could work, the Bitcoin, appeared in 2009 would not be what it is today. I realized now that it's better to have trusted human guarantors, even if it's very imperfect. If Dfinity didn't have all this power, I would have jumped ship.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-17 19:08:32 UTC | #93

Excellent and thoughtful answer. I couldn't agree more: if DFINITY was incidental to ICP, what Dom does or doesn't do with the money he made legally or illegally, ethically or unethically (not the same thing), lose any interest to me. And yes, the question you ask, given the answer you hope for, would resolve the biggest vulnerability I see in the project, replacing it with other, design focused concerns. 

"As a developer myself, I am more interested in knowing when or whether IC can grow independent from the dfinity foundation. It is unavoidable in the early days that a platform needs its original creator, but is the tie between IC and the dfinity foundation grow stronger or looser?"

Those are two different questions. The answer to the second is clearly that yes, the relationship is growing looser, given DFINITY's laudable choice to abstain on a range of strategic NNS votes. 

But in terms of the systemic vulnerability to Dfinity's dangerously awful governance standards as a (nominally) non-profit foundation, the question is not whether it's looser or stronger, but whether it is decoupled **enough** for Dom's total control not to constrain, shape or endanger the unfolding of IC. And I think the very fact this thread is unfolding, shows that DFINITY remains very, very far from peripheral to IC. If Dom sneezes, there is nothing approaching the social distancing required to stop IC catching Covid. 

And yes, I hear the messaging from DFINITY about wanting to step back, acknowledge the positive steps in this direction, and I'm even predisposed to believe in the intentions and good will of the team as a whole. But: is Dom's position, legal ensconcement, doubling down ("advising"?) on lack of disclosure, and current activity online the sign of someone wanting to step back, chill out, and watch his baby leave the nest? Or do those indicators suggest someone still deeply invested, personally and economically, and ready to make decisions to keep a steering hand quietly hovering near the scales?

And if the latter, does the current direction of travel of DFINITY allow you, as a developer, to build confident in the direction of travel, when Dom, and Dom alone and exclusively could, tomorrow, decide that Dfinity resumes its NNS voting? Dom and Dom alone, once everyone has built good infrastructure on the premise of DFINITY receding in control, could go, thanks for all the fish, on second thoughts we're back? Or absolutely any other scenario that comes to him?

I think that Dom would be delighted with the community's "ability to continue develop and advance the technology behind IC." Free labour on a project he controls, and where any retreats are a sign of his largesse, and subject to his fiat. 

I agree the questions you ask are the most critical ones. I think we are a long way from being able to answer them in a way that makes the sole control of Dom over dfinity with zero disclosure, accountability or transparency, anything other than IC's key constraint and biggest risk.

There is no need for DFINITY to take on your idea: they might have different priorities; different implementation philosophies; different people already working on it. But the fact that you would see a need to collaborate with DFINITY demonstrates the centrality of DFINITY in the ecosystem, even after renouncing a range of votes.
[/quote]
There is actually a dire need to incorporate collective prioritization into the NNS, and into every DAO, since there is no way possible for power to be decentralized without this capability. However, if their hidden intention is retain their centralization of power indefinitely, then I agree that there would technically be no "need" for them to explore any decentralization options. In fact, they would actively oppose such efforts. Hence my due diligence test of their intentions.

As for "different people already working on it", I have done a fair amount of review of the literature and potential individuals at DFINITY with relevant backgrounds to address this problem. I am fairly certain that no one there is even seeing this as a major problem yet, let alone working on how to solve it. More likely, they have no idea how deep this academic rabbit hole goes and how many academic fields it cuts across.

Sorry, "need" was clumsy. I meant obligation. DFINITY is not obliged to adopt your idea. The point I was making was that DFINITY remains so inseparable from IC that you feel a need for their buy-in (Dom's buy-in) to take that agenda forward. Is there a reason the current proposal system is not a sufficient channel for you to have your vision adopted into the system?

I would be very interested to read your research, btw. I think the oligopolist effect of liquid democracy in every crypto I've looked at is the biggest systemic challenge to web3 and I get a sense your PhD attempts to somehow keep the status quo in coin distribution yet find a way to make decision making not determined by coin concentration? Anyway, discussion on this specific subject of prioritisation belongs on another thread. If you point me one or start one, I will be happy to continue the conversation there.

The DFNITY's power on the network is not the problem, it's the solution. As Bitcoin high cost in energy is not the problem, but the solution. If DFINITY would not have this power, it could be very very very dangerous, and more dangerous at this low price. 

Their power will diminish a bit over time, but to begin with, their power must remain strong to protect the network and make the best decisions. There would be powerful actors, who would have interest to destroy the ICP network. The DEFI on ICP is a threat for all other blockchains... Some may want to eliminate this threat. They are ever trying by dropping the price, but If they accumulated too many tokens, they could influence the votes to make terrible decisions.

From my point of view, those who do not understand what I am saying, can only be stupid or enemies of ICP.

**DFINITY is made of smart and good people, if you don't let them keep a lot of power, of people will lot of money will take it.**
**There are no debates. There are no debates. There are no debates.**

If you don't understand this, you are crazy, and you probably understand absolutely nothing about how the world works, and nothing about how cryptocurrencies markets works... And you're a perfect example of why the democracy is more dangerous in hands like yours rather than in the good hands of DFINITY dictators.

>IC’s code is not completely FOSS, so if Dfinity ever went rogue the community can’t easily fork the protocol

This is an absolutely, non-negotiably critical point. The entire IC boils down entirely to the undisclosed, un-reportable and unchecked decisions of just one man. Who oversaw an ethically compromised Genesis. You'd think, at the time when SBF, the genius, the philanthropist, the progressive, brought down FTX, IC people would be a little more cautious. What do so many of the spectacular collapses in crypto have in common? Sole power and zero transparency concentrated in a single CEO.  Again, you'd think by now that transparency, accountability mechanisms, and ideally power sharing, would be one of the design principles that would be baked into newer initiatives, for their own wellbeing.

A good dictactorship is better thank a false democracy. Dfinity is made of most brillant mind in the world, probably with some of them working to change the world more than because the need of money. For this reason, I am not bothered by their large power on the network. The perfect democracy can’t exist in this world…
[/quote]

I have commented along these lines too in another thread, per my excerpt below. In short, a dictatorship model can be effective and lower risk in the startup phase, but it will not be at all appropriate in any scalability scenario that is remotely close to what DFINITY envisions for the IC in the future. That's why we need to start exploring collective prioritization options for the NNS now, since that capability is totally nonexistent now.

[quote="Sabr, post:218, topic:16156"]
The Internet Computer won’t be perceived as a beta project for much longer. As the stakes become higher and more real, the cracks in the decentralization narrative will become exponentially more obvious and repugnant to those who depend on the IC to sustain their livelihoods and ecosystems.

In the meantime, we just have to accept the following: 1) DFinity is a single point of failure in this visionary project, which (if unchanged) will increasingly endanger its fundamental mission to oppose both centralized power and censorship; and 2) DFinity is essentially run under a traditional dictatorship model, like every organization on the planet today that is too large for deliberative democracy and other consensus reaching processes.

From my perspective, I am quite OK with this concentrated risk and dictatorial power during the startup phase. It could even add to both innovation agility and the prospects of success given the trust that I currently have for the DFinity team and its vision. However, in the longer term, I think we all agree that we should never have to rely on trust, and we most certainly can’t rely on any dictatorship remaining benevolent or censorship-free when the economic and societal stakes for the IC grow exponentially higher. That is why I have been so emphatic about initiating some sort of collective effort to cross the “prioritization chasm”. This is the only way the decentralization vision can become a genuine reality – in bulletproof fashion – instead of just being an illusion of decentralized power that we have today.

Fine: let's go with this, in my view, somewhat naive perspective. Let's accept the plebs cannot be trusted, that decentralisation is not really that big a part of the blockchain vision, that our betters know best. I accept: let's keep the balance of power, not in DFINITY, but in Dom as the sole controller of DFINITY.

Now tell me the many advantages to the system of that absolute power requiring no transparency, no disclosures, no reporting, and having no procedural, enforceable boundaries to ensure fair play. I'll wait.

The problem is not authority: it is accountability and transparency: whether it is by Dom, by DFINITY or the NNS voters. So even if we go with your hyper centralised utopia, we need to make the exercise of that absolute power transparent, rational, beneficial and accountable. Even if we're not worthy of holding the power, we are surely worthy of knowing how we can avoid its abuse, and if abused, get some form of redress and correction. Or are we not worthy, even of that?

So what's the difference between a "good" and "bad" dictatorship? I would suggest a good dictatorship is one that is transparent and accountable. A bad one is one that is neither. A good dictatorship asks you for trust and gives you the elements to verify. A bad one, only gives you the option of faith, while holding every single thing you build, invest or purchase in IC on his sole, unfettered, unrestricted hands. Is that really your optimal scenario?

@Leamsi, feel free to continue this conversation in the governance thread, where I first brought up this topic in my very first post on this forum 23 days ago. Check for my follow-up posts there too.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-governance/15584/22?u=sabr

I agree with your view that DFINITY is currently inseparable from the IC, hence the key problem.

Approval voting per the NNS and every other DAO has no prioritization capability amongst competing alternatives, nor will it ever have this capability due to its fundamental lack of information granularity. All the toughest and most important decisions generally involve prioritizations and tradeoffs between alternatives, not just a yes/no approval on isolated alternatives/proposals.

The problems with liquid democracy as currently implemented are actually much easier to fix. However, it doesn't make a lot of sense to try to fix this problem without implementing a collective prioritization capability first. For example, the latter can actually be used to fix the voting power problem simply by allocating voting power based upon a vote on the evaluators themselves (i.e., where evaluators or classes of evaluators are the alternatives being collectively prioritized to determine their respective voting power/weights).

Dictatorship is something necessary for short term changes and big step in evolution. It is fair that Dfinity used this for safety reasons during the decentralisation process.

I am personally convinced that Dfinitys intention are to go in the right direction and give gradually more power to the community.

Yet I have few concerns to formulate : 
  1. For the community to make good decisions, we need to be informed and also educated. We need a open source book of the specification of the functionment of this non profit association, its finance and directionm priority, stakes etc..
  2. This information has to be provided progressively ( we cant probably swallow all stakes in one shot )
  3. This information has to be delivered in a good Timing. I guess if we do not have this information yet, its because the Bird cant really fly safely yet.

The big cons I see from Dictatorship, is that if you delete the leader, the whole house of cards likely collapes. And imo Doms safety alone is a good enough reason to decentralize this decision weigh as soon as possible. I am also convinced that he knows this and that it is on his best interest. So I think he will do it as soon as he can.

If someone would just confirm my hypothesis and tell me that * the time didnt come yet * I would understand.

But then, when ?

cheers

Agreed. To follow upon that argument, let's assume that Dom has been somehow verified to be a saint. Ultimately that doesn't decrease the risk at all. Dom could get hit by the proverbial bus any day. And one day, with absolute certainty, a new unknown dictator will take his place. That's why I find it a bit distracting to focus on one particular person here.
