Hello everyone!

The Languages team at DFINITY is excited to introduce [`mo-dev`](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-dev-server), a flexible command-line tool which enables [full-stack live reloading](https://blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-full-stack-live-reload/) for your Motoko dapp or smart contract. 

Here is a Medium post with a bit of background about live reloading and some tips for setting up `mo-dev` for a new or existing project:

We've also set up an online Gitpod demo so that you can try `mo-dev` directly in your browser!

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rvanasa/vite-react-motoko)

`mo-dev` is designed to work seamlessly with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and other popular front-end dev servers, contributing the following live-reload capabilities:

* Deploying canisters to the local replica
* Generating language bindings
* Running unit tests (files ending with `.test.mo`)
* Executing commands

Get started by running `npm install -g mo-dev` (or downloading a standalone binary from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-dev-server/releases) page). From there, run `mo-dev --help` to view all available features. 

Since `mo-dev` is already being used in several internal DFINITY projects, check out the following GitHub repositories for real-world usage examples:

* [Vite + React + Motoko starter project](https://github.com/rvanasa/vite-react-motoko)
* [DFINITY developer experience feedback board](https://github.com/dfinity/feedback) (Vite)
* [Motoko Playground](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-playground) (Create React App)
* [Motoko base library](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base) (unit testing)

It's also worth mentioning that the [Motoko VS Code extension](https://github.com/dfinity/vscode-motoko) has a built-in UI for the `mo-dev` test runner:

As always, feedback is an important part of our development process! Please feel free to report a bug, suggest a feature, make a contribution, or even just leave a star on the project's GitHub repository:

Looking forward to seeing what you create with this new live-reload workflow!
