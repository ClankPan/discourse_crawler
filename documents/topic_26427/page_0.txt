I'm looking into ways to interact with NNS Governance programatically, basically, creating and managing neurons with dfx or in Motoko. 

There's [this guide](https://github.com/flyq/blogs/blob/master/Dfinity/How%20to%20use%20dfx%20to%20interact%20with%20NNS%20canisters%20instead%20of%20nns%20app_en.md) which covers the basics of interacting using dfx. However, some of the function calls mentioned in the guide are not present in the NNS governance canister (for example the `notify_dfx` call). Seeing how the guide was last updated 3 years ago, I imagine some things might have changed over the years.

The question is, is there documentation on interacting with the NNS Governance canisters outside of using the NNS app?

Maybe this will help <https://jglts-daaaa-aaaai-qnpma-cai.ic0.app/657.0a820e5f4764e1fdad12eae263084ba07004864f9a4bcb466907e009> 
This is the NNS interface <https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai> 
There is also a js library: <https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/tree/main/packages/nns>
These are not using dfx, but allow you to do everything that is possible.
