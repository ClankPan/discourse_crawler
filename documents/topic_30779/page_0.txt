Hello Everyone :--) 

I hv lost my tokens in NNS. there were 150 icp tokens & over 0.03 ckbtc.

after login with my internet identity in nns (https://nns.ic0.app/), the error message says:-

An error occurred while loading the accounts. Call failed: Canister: emww2-4yaaa-aaaaq-aacbq-cai Method: icrc1_balance_of (query) "Status": "rejected" "Code": "SysTransient" "Message": "IC0207: Canister emww2-4yaaa-aaaaq-aacbq-cai is unable to process query calls because it's frozen. Please top up the canister with cycles and try again."

Please help :--)

Hey, dont worry it will get fixed soon. Some SNS project ledger canister is freezed due to low cycle balance due to which nns frontend is getting stuck. As soon as this will be noticed by project team, your issue will get resolved. Your tokens are in place.

Correct. It's the Trax ledger canister ([emww2-4yaaa-aaaaq-aacbq-cai](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/emww2-4yaaa-aaaaq-aacbq-cai)) which ran out of cycles.
