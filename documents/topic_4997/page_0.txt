Example: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/troubleshooting.html

*When center content is scrolled right sidebar is scrolled as well*

**Solution**:

Was able to fix the issue in inspector by moving position:sticky; and top:8.8125rem; in the css to the .toc-menu class (and removing it from the .toc class) 

Furthermore, removing the padding from the .toc class locks it in place so it doesn't move that initial 1rem; on scrolling
