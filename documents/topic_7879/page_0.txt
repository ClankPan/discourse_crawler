I cannot access my assets canister since a couple of minutes. Likewise, cannot access the Motoko Playground nor the internet identity.

I either get `500` errors `Internal Server Error` or invalid SSL certificate.

https://status.internetcomputer.org/ reports no errors ü§î.

Anyone notice the issue too?

Yes, even https://nns.ic0.app/ cannot be opened

Everything seems to be down :open_mouth:

Good to hear I am not alone.

The [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/) also displays that everything is alright ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ok folks, I get it, I'll stop my DDOS attack. :roll_eyes:

I‚Äôve used this in the past for dynamic ssl allocation. https://github.com/auto-ssl/lua-resty-auto-ssl

It seems that everything on the domain ic0.app is not responding

Looks like the SSL certificates expired about 30 minutes ago?

peterparker | 2021-10-13 13:11:53 UTC | #9

Indeed seems so (I'm on GMT+2)

Alright it seems it has just been renewed. Services seems accessible too.

I'm excited for the post-mortem on why this happened

-------------------------

Ahoy ICP folks!

I can confirm that the issue has been fixed: https://status.internetcomputer.org/incidents/jwxss6c6r27v

and that we are working on an incident report (still investigating and confirming root causes).

Thx for the feedback @diegop üëç

There seem to be quite some delay between the [status](https://status.internetcomputer.org/) and the effective issues, I mean, while the issue was effectively happening, the status page was still displaying zero problems and was displaying that everything was alright.

Is this also known and tracked?

Definitely. It was certainly unfortunate and not the experience we all want for the IC.

Thanks, looking forward to the details. In addition to understanding the technical issues, please unpack the implications from a single-point-of-failure "off-switch" perspective.
