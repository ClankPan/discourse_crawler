Is there a dfx command to build all my Rust canisters but, skip another type of canister like the frontend?

My project got three Rust canisters and a frontend dapp. I'm doing refactoring in the backend code therefore would be handy to be able to do something like `dfx build everything except frontend`.

Quite a particular use case though.

No, we don't have such an option. In this case, I'd actually recommend you use `cargo check` directly to make your iterations as fast as possible

Good tips, thanks Severin.
