 ------UPDATE---- I went through the beginning processes. I used DFX and quill to get to the point of creating what's necessary, funding it, and staking the funds for a year. Now I'm ready to make the proposal. I just have to make sense of the info I'm finding. For example, for Proposal Format-  I see one guide that states there's 5 fields (Summary, URL, Proposer, Proposal Type, Parameters). But I go over " Example Motion Project Proposal", I don't see those fields. I see Objective, Background, Why this is Important, Pros, Cons, etc...  This looks like 2 ways to do it. Which one applies? Is correct? And which Proposal Type should i use if I'm asking to freeze a neuron that was stolen from me? I was thinking ManageNeuron. But what makes me think that's not right is that "Only the followers of the target neuron may vote on these proposals". I would like to allow anyone who can vote on it to vote. Am I missing something? Then there's the DFX transmission part, "Example NNS motion proposal with `$TITLE`, `$MOTION_TEXT`, `$SUMMARY`, and `$NEURON_ID` filled out:". Here's the example given for that: dfx --identity proposals canister --network ic call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron '(record {id = null; command=opt variant {MakeProposal=record {url=""; title="Open Governance canister for SNS | Design proposal";action=opt variant {Motion=record {motion_text="Present design proposal for Open Governance canister"}}; summary="

How is one supposed to make sense of this without more info?

It seems you are following the instructions here. Is that right? If so, I’m having trouble reading your copy because of the formatting. Did you get an error when you submitted it? Can you share it?

What are you quoting? Is that in the doc above?

Thanks for getting back to me.
Yes, the document that you mentioned is the main one i was working off. I'm afraid to to try send off a proposal with that amount of info. I'm just not confident that it would be accurate enough to work. Especially if I get the proposal type wrong.

I also used this too: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/proposal-advanced

And this too: 
https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/proposal-requirements     Scroll down to proposal format. Below that is Proposal topics, which is where I saw the info on who can vote for Manage neuron proposal type. And since then, I've been wondering if this restriction is for followers of the neuron that I want to freeze, or followers of the nueron that I'm using to make the proposal?

 I ended up finding an example that you posted back in 2021. And I thought I might just try to alter it to fit what I'm trying to do. In that post I saw: 
********************
$ dfx --identity proposals canister --network ic --no-wallet call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron ‘(record {id = null; command=opt variant {MakeProposal=record {url=“”; title=”In the NNS Frontend dapp, add cycle_dao’s neuron (5967494994762486275) so people can follow cycle_dao”;action=opt variant {Motion=record {motion_text=“”}}; summary=”As part of liquid democracy, neuron holders can choose to follow the voting choices of other neurons. This can be done manually, but a very common and consumer-friendly way is to use the ‘follow neuron’ functionality in the NNS Frontend dapp. To further decentralization, this proposal is to add cycle_dao’s neuron: 5967494994762486275.”}}; neuron_id_or_subaccount=opt variant {NeuronId=record {id=5241875388871980017:nat64}}})’
***************************************
Would you help me modify that to apply to my neuron to freeze ( id- 7705773937459451846 ), neuron to use to send ( NeuronId = record { id = 6_200_233_367_052_425_345 : nat64 } ), and my proposal?
The other thing that I’m not sure about is the proposal type and corresponding canister address. Would what I'm trying to do, freeze a neuron that was stolen from me, be the same proposal type? Would it need to send the proposal to the same canister id as yours?

I'm also currently trying to find the ID of the smaller neuron. I'm hoping to be able to query in order to find it based on the date/time of creation. Once I have it I want to include it in to my proposal too.
*******************************************************************
Does this look correct?

He was logged into my account at the same time I was. He was creating addresses as I was deleting them. But he was telling me that it was a hacker that was doing it.

When I asked how I can verify that he's a Kraken employee, he verified my reading of my full SSN and drivers license number. I thought he was legit. while events were happening with him, I was even receiving Kraken emails that looked legit, down to the header info. I was so shocked I could hardly even speak. I didn't know how I was going to protect myself.

He then texted me a site to use to disconnect my wallet from my Kraken account, www.stop-kraken.com I told him that this makes no sense. But I was too freaked out to think clearly. The site looked just like the Kraken site. I must have told him that this does not make sense 10 times. But eventually I somehow gave in. Since I wasn't thinking clearly I fell for it and I entered my seed phrase and ID into his site (in order to cancel a pending transaction, per his instructions). Then he stole my id and neurons. I also had created a neuron of 500 ICP, staking for five years.

I called him back and left a message. He called me back the next day. He continued the front of being a Kraken employee, but then he changed and told me that he took over my Internet Identity. That it is in his control now. And that he would give it back if I give him $50,000 in Bitcoin. When I told him that I can't do that, he soon hung up on me.

Freezing these neurons, the main one with 14,381.378558 ICP, and the smaller one with 500 ICP) is most likely the only way I can get my ICP back. At least he'll know he can't cash in. Please help me out by approving this proposal.

For what it’s worth, if it can be helpful, you can also create a MOTION proposal on the dApp I created for this purpose:

https://proposals.network

-------------------------

diegop | 2024-05-28 07:25:29 UTC | #6

@Onadrac i am not sure you know this based on the description of your problem, so I thought I’d clarify just in case:

1. There are many types of proposal types 
2. Most the proposal types (if passed) alter the code the ICP blockchain 
3. There is an unique proposal type called “motion” which does NOT modify the code of ICP
4. Motion proposals are for the community to deliberate or vote on their intent. 
5. The example I wrote is about motion proposals.

So when you submit a motion proposal, all you have to do is describe what you want people to vote on.

Here are examples of motion proposals (confusingly aliased “governance” sometimes):

1. This is very long, and I can’t type check on my head but roughly looks right 

2. The main problem I see is that as a voter it is unclear what you want the community to do. What does freeze a neuron mean? Does that functionality even exist? If it does not exist, are you asking someone build it? If built,  Who gets to press the button of this functionality? How do I know it won’t be  maliciously used? Honestly, I have so many questions, I suggest you ask for a design proposal on how to even design this mechanism, but I guess it’s reasonable you first start by making known your situation.

Hi @Onadrac,
similar to @diegop I am not quite sure what you intent to do in / with the proposal. Could you maybe try to clarify?

Also, it might help if you provide a bit of background in this post. I assume you refer to [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/my-15-000-plus-icp-was-stolen/31180/12), but this might not be clear for new readers of this post.

Hello Diego and Lara. I'm asking for this based upon the suggestion of Dfinity support. Here's the message that I received from Dfinity Support:
*******************************************************************************************

May 8, 2024, 10:30 EDT

Thank you for contacting the DFINITY Support Team. The Internet Computer is a decentralized blockchain, and as such, DFINITY has no access to accounts or funds. You could try to submit a NNS proposal to freeze the neuron, the NNS has not accepted any such proposal in the past.

Best,

DFINITY Support Team

I'd imagine that getting the proposal type is important. Because I only want to have this applied to the neurons that were stolen from me. Not make a change to the code of ICP altogether.

I literally cannot stop thinking about this scenario. I am actively following this as an educational opportunity and to support you (for what it’s worth) so if you could continue posting updates and sharing whatever you’re able to along the way I for one would appreciate it. 

I just have sooooooo many questions still

Onadrac | 2024-05-29 01:48:34 UTC | #12

It looks like they had me barking up the wrong tree. Instead of suggesting that I make a proposal to freeze the neuron, they should have told me that what I have to do is make a proposal to the developers to build a freezing mechanism into ICP. And that's because ICP doesn't have a way to freeze anything at this point. So a general proposal would never get off the ground. I've initiated the request with the developers. Hopefully they help me out here.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-05-29 03:30:21 UTC | #13

Well, I’m unsure if I would say barking up the wrong tree… There are a lot of questions right away that would/will need clarification for sure and I’m a John Smith little guy nobody in the community… I'm going to assume this is happening and not a well-choreographed event and give you my best reply because I would hate to be in this situation, especially, with the amount of cash involved. 

Coming from an average user/ voter for example, it seems like this could be easily brushed off as either a fake situation, or if not, then what if what you ask them to create starts poking at a genie in a bottle that after it’s out, it’s out, and a lot could go wrong. 

What would this imply for my neuron?

Can anyone just start making allegations and start tying up neurons in court hearings? 

How deep can deep fakes go to maliciously manipulate any feature we may make specifically for this case? Because again if they design this feature or function and it’s approved through the NNS, it might mean it's done and cannot be undone once it's designed. It could end up reallocating time and resources, and end up creating a function like @diegop is saying where people would ask who gets the right to press the button in the future. It’s such a grey area that needs addressing for sure. 

Just from what I know of the governance and voting system on the IC does work exactly as DFINITY explains. For better or worse, and I suppose it's subjective if it's *better or worse*. It is rather technical though. 

So, even if/when these situations occur the legal professionals and investigative teams looking into your specific case will end up needing individuals with a technical skill set to help facilitate whatever your geographic area does in/for this type of cybercrime situation. This brings up even more questions... and again is dependent on so many geographic locations, rules, and regulations, and all of them have their standards of doing things... 

So assume this is real, and you’re just an investor that this, unfortunately, happened to under just the right circumstances. The investigative team will eventually need to do their own "leg work", and will need to formally reach out. Wait for them to do so. 

Easier said than done? Yup. but again, this is tricky...  

I know there is a six-month time constraint/ worry. However, it is six months, not six hours. So, there is that...

How did they get your II just from your info off Kraken though? I'm not familiar with Kraken only Coinbase, and Coinbase does not hold information that has to be directly linked to my II at all. What did they ask that made you give them information on your IC Identity and not just limit it to the typical crypto KYC procedures? Even that would be bad, but not *this* bad. Again not denying the possibility of stress...and Coinbase has a process that is sketchy as well... So, I hear you... 

I'm interested in seeing it play out, and I hope it plays out well for you. I just think there is a lot the *right* people should/ will need to do for your circumstance.

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-05-29 12:01:18 UTC | #14

Thank you jsull9. Well said. And, yes, I agree, there are a lot of things that need to be put on the table and cleared up. And that does take time. I just hope it can be accomplished within the 5 months that I have to work with.

I would also like to know more about the difference(s) between making a proposal like this one and a motion proposal, which were the instructions that I was following? As seen here: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Create_an_NNS_motion_proposal

To answer your question about how they got my II from Kraken. It wasn't that they got it through Kraken. What happened is that I got a notification about a suspicious login on my Kraken account, then a few minutes later this person called me up on the night of May 2nd. 

He identified himself as Sebastian from Kraken. He asked if I was in the Salt Lake City area right now. Because that's where the login was found to be. I told him now. He said he would kick that person off.

So he told me that I should login and change my password to Kraken, So I did while I was on the phone with him.

He told me that he 's seeing some strange activity on my account. That addresses to send crypto off to were being created as we spoke.

He recommend that I delete them. As I did more were being created. But it was him the whole time. He was already logged into my account. And me changing my password did not affect him.

As he did certain things I was receiving Kraken emails. I checked the validity of the emails. They were legit, down to the header info. This made his call look legit. He also gave me my full SSN and driver's license number.

At a certain point, he was telling me that there was a pending transaction that will go through if not cancelled. That it's coming through from a wallet that is connected to my account. I told him that there's not wallet connected to it. He said there is somehow. That maybe the hacker connected it? And he said that it looks like a ICP transaction.

So he texted me a link to [www.Stop-Kraken.com](http://www.stop-kraken.com/) The site has since been taken down by the host/registrar. But I saved the pages and code behind it before then.

He said that is a secret site that Kraken used for this purpose. To disconnect wallets from accounts. So I logged in with the very same Kraken password. The one that I just changed it to. And i was in.

That's where I entered the recovery phrase of my ICP internet id/wallet. That's how he stole it.

Well, 5/6 months is a good chunk of time. Plus if they dissolve and they move you can follow that paper trail. Forensic accountants are talented people just saying... So, if/when they cash out or anything you can watch it. That's the great thing about blockchain. 


To be fair, I have had a phone call or two with Coinbase that I wish I never had during a moment of highlighted stress. So, I could see how in the moment under the right circumstances *anything* is possible. As a nerd in this particular area, I've read stories of individuals way more qualified than I end up in even worse situations just because of a "one-off situation". Life happens man... I hear you...

That Stop-Kraken page though I would've seen Kammie off the MTV show Catfish be like 
![Image|690x388](upload://i50xv5ywu2CORPy1eGfA06YfOG8.jpeg)

and that would've been the end personally. Hey, it's done and done. Don't cry over spilled milk. Let's just pick it up... 


If they created that site and used a VPN to disguise their IP etc. etc., I know Nord and most VPN companies are required to comply with various agencies, and if subpoenaed or given a warrant will comply and they can determine who the user is on their end and help track it down further... It gets complicated and easier said than done. Plus, you're right... Time is of the essence and the legal nonsense could take a lifetime literally. So, it sucks...

I'm still not sure why you connected anything to do with your II though... there was no reason for your II to be involved at all even if it was genuinely Kraken. No one specifically asks for your IC information, unless they knew you had x,y,z. Which makes me think it could be a "closer to home" scenario. 

Sebastian, in my opinion, must've known you had x,y,z and this was (assuming it's real) a well-choreographed inside event. 


To be honest, I wish we had grants or bounties where people could create all the scenarios under the sun and run them out with "fake accounts" and just create case examples or a standard set of procedures for these things.

For example, a grant of 100,000 used to run a scenario where someone "stole my ICP" and now we walk it through from top to bottom fully knowing it wasn't stolen, and we did it to essentially test these types of circumstances. 

Send all these fake scenarios right to court and play them out like they are real... then the precedent is set. No excuses. 

However, this would take way more resources than my head could wrap around and is a bit off-topic... Just food for thought...

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-05-29 13:20:13 UTC | #16

Oh and btw creating a motion proposal will essentially waste your ICP in this scenario... I would save that cash and throw it in the legal fees slot lol Unless you're trying to get a wider audience drawn to your posts here on the forum... 

Motion proposals are from my perspective "temp checks" on how the community perceives or is receptive to a certain idea. It just highlights areas of work being done IMO... Even if it was approved it wouldn't be able to "freeze" anything. It would just let people gauge the idea of "freezing anything"...

So, it would be like using 10 ICP to see if the community at large would entertain the idea of having a freeze function. Then if they do or push it through as a "yes", then you would *still* have to do as @diegop says and create a separate proposal to create this functionality. 

I do not see a motion proposal going over well in this space... which would make me think asking for the feature is just as unlikely. However, if you can come up with a proposal to directly ask them to create the function it *might* be worth using the 10 ICP to see *that* answer...

IMO that is probably why you're confused about what type of proposal (if any) to submit, why the team is telling you a motion proposal isn't ideal for your situation, and why asking for the feature developed is. 

*That* is why even a small voter like myself would be asking a million and five questions on what this means moving forward... It opens up pandoras box

Onadrac | 2024-05-29 13:57:25 UTC | #17

I agree. When I saw the site www.stop-kraken.com  I should have realized something wasn't right. But here I was talking to a guy who knew my SSN and DL #. There was somebody with full access to my Kraken account. Since there's mult- function authentication I wonder if they hacked my cell phone too. He's saying things to keep me from settling down, keep me freaked out. Make me worry more. And my life's savings investment is hanging on the line. And this is happening at 10:30 to 11:00 PM at night by now. I wish I could do that over again.

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-05-29 13:58:54 UTC | #18

Maybe instead of freezing it, put another step in there before being able to cash it in, which would be a step that a thief would not want to take?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-05-29 14:27:14 UTC | #19

Hey, the internet can be a pretty scary and convincing place... I hear ya. I'm not going to judge. 

You say SSN and DL so I'll confidently assume you're in the USA.
I do not know how they got your DL# or SSN... or full access to your Kraken having used the Multi-factor-authentication method (MFA) as a sign-in option. This would be beyond my skill set...  See places like 


https://www.ssa.gov/number-card 

https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/report-stolen-number

https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10064.pdf

Use the investigative team to help you figure out the best reports to file and get a new SSN

Sign up for something like [this](https://www.idx.us) and watch your report thoroughly 

Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles and replace/ change your driver's license and number. 

Sounds like a typical case of cybercrime/ Identity Theft... Probably more. Not sure. I'm not a lawyer or anyone with authority. I'm saying all this as someone whose interest you've peaked and who thinks this scenario should be considered/played out with caution and taken very seriously.

Again, just to reiterate, I do not have the skillset or authority required to be able to help you on the technical or legal level. I'm not a lawyer or an advisor. Just Joe Shmoe trying to pitch in... 

I'm not sure it would be possible or plausible to put an additional step or layer of security in. If so, I think what the team is saying is that it cannot be done for a singular event (aka just you and these neurons and your IC ID). It would have to be something they make and then it could be used thereafter for everyone with everything inside Pandora's box... Then the worms crawl out of the can and the same guy who robbed you is using the same function to now hold everyone's neuron hostage in long-term court hearings... Or, who gets to say when that button or function is used? What country's authority is thee authority? They don't pay me enough to ponder these questions... I'm just a regular guy with his thumb up his butt looking for candy in all the wrong places...

Thank you for contacting the DFINITY Support Team. The Internet Computer is a decentralized blockchain, and as such, DFINITY has no access to accounts or funds. You could try to submit a NNS proposal to freeze the neuron, the NNS has not accepted any such proposal in the past.

Best,

DFINITY Support Team
[/quote]

I should expound on what the support team member said, for clarity, and add some helpful context that may not be obvious from directly answering your questions.

1. There is no existing mechanism for the NNS to freeze a neuron. Nor is there a NNS proposal type to do this.

2. The IC is controlled by the NNS so in theory, there could be a *vote to add such a feature*

3. When the support team member said "You could try to submit a NNS proposal to freeze the neuron...", he was being honest that is the only way to freeze a neuron (adding the feature via vote).

4. In the history of the IC in 3 years, there has never been a similar vote and that is why the dfinity support member said "the NNS has not accepted any such proposal in the past." They were trying to set your expectations.

5. If you still wish to do this, since the ICP id decentralized, you would have to get consensus to do this. One way to do this is via the forum, social media, and even doing NNS *motion* proposals. Motion proposals do not change the code, but they are an existing mechanism for the community to vote on things other than code updates. Examples include getting temperature checks to see if people are interested in a feature before it gets submitted as a code update, for example.

For context, ICP has never frozen a neuron and this is very much akin to reverting back a transaction... which is very do-able in blockchain (if enough parties agree), but also very rare. Ethereum did something similar in 2016, and has not done it since.

I am very, very upset this happened to you. I would be just as frustrated and angry as you are if it had happened to me. No one is immune to these kinds of attacks as bad actors can be very sophisticated, and i hate when people are taken advantage by these bad actors.

Also, in regard to garnering support, would that just amount to reaching out via forums and social media as much as I can, to present the idea and get feedback? If so, how would I know that I've reached enough people to have a good chance of having the majority in a vote?
And, in a motion proposal, what "type" would this kind of proposal be?
Thank you.

So my last comment to avoid misdirection of the conversation. 

I thought about maybe coming up with a way to prove the scenario is real and show documentation of some kind that shows yup this is real and it really happened to you and the respective teams/law enforcement agencies are looking into it. 

Then after it’s proved and it gains enough support from members such as @diegop or @lara maybe we crowd fund you, or start a campaign to crowd fund you, then if we raise enough it could go to you. Then somehow once this is resolved legally we could have the stolen icp disbursed back to the donors and each would get exactly what they donated. Idk… I would save and donate ICP for the cause… if demonstrated it’s real of course.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-05-29 22:12:17 UTC | #24

It would take just 150 of us to donate 10 of our maturity or just ICP to replace what was stolen from you. I feel there’s gotta be 149 others out there willing to with enough proof and ability to facilitate that donation

-------------------------

diegop | 2024-05-29 22:34:50 UTC | #25

fwiw, I would be one the 149.

Now we got 2 :slight_smile:

A blockchain community is more than just the consensus protocol, it is also the *community* that lives in it. I think this could be my routine "ICP donation" i do in the community which has given me so much. One could argue that this will encourage people to start asking for tokens based on stories... but I would argue, thats already life. People ask, people create stories, and people both choose to donate or not. I just embrace it.

I suspect finding others to donate is much easier than changing the NNS mechanisms.

Wow! Thank you, Johnathan. Thank you for your support and continued thoughts and concerns.  That sure does sound like a great idea. The thing that I think I like most about it would be that it would get more people than just me (and people like you) involved with what's going on. It would lead them to vote for the development of something to help in these kinds of situations. It would also lead them to keep an eye on the situation, so that it can get resolved. And then they get recompensed. They'd have a vested interest.

Another good aspect of it would be that it is possible to duplicate it. If there happens to be someone else out there who gets ripped off like this, we could do the same thing for that person.

But I would only want to do this if enough people collectively agree.

As far as proof, have you seen everything I posted here:

[Evidence of Me Owning My ICP and Evidence of it being Stolen](https://someonestolemyicp.com/)
    

As far who's investigating it, the investigator's name is Michael Stempien of the Stamford CT Police Department. He's doing a great job with what he has to work with. And he allows me to give him all that I'm looking into, and discovering, as time goes on.

I've also sent info out to the FBI, Secret Service Cyber Crime Dept, and the Cyber Crime Department of the State of CT. But my local PD is the head of it all. 

I've attached an email that I recently sent him regarding the website that I created to display a good overview and evidence. I've also attached the transactions from Kraken, a CSV as well as the transactions from the Ledger. They show that I sold all my Cardano, which I held for years. And put it all into ICP.

How else can I prove that this is real? Would you like to see the code from the site that stole it? 

Thank you so much for your help. When this first happened I almost off'ed myself. I was so disappointed in what I fell for. I'm still beyond disappointed. The one good thing that I can say is that my wife still loves me. Talk about a true test of love. 

Best regards,

Geoff Jacobs

I’d be willing to throw in some free labor (hehe) and make a forum post to get a small audience. 

If you (we) can come up with a way to show the legitimacy of this situation, and whatever agency/ investigative team you end up working with can give you something that shows this is a real situation or something to legitimize it formally, and that can be confirmed, or ask whatever lawyer DA the formal legal representative to provide something that is okay to share publicly without impacting the investigation or ongoing court process. Tell them the community is willing to help you start a crowdfunding campaign to replace your stolen funds, then in the event they find and track down the individual and 800 years of court battles ends... Donors *could/might* get it back or its donation (I'd do donation idc this sucks). Otherwise, if it's a real scenario, and nothing happens it's a loss we could all just show up 150-strong like you robbed all of us and now we know. 

I'm down to help out... I'm down to donate time/ 10+ ICP to help.

[/quote]

That's why I think if the scenario is real we can come up with a standard of proof per se. It wouldn't *just* be stories it would be for circumstances like this. Where this just shouldn't happen to someone... I would just make it clear people can't start asking for donations cause they have a story... I would say the story needs to be backed up by something that says this individual is really pursuing this formally and it was a real cyber crime you're all not being conned or "catfished". 

Shoot boots on the ground let's go. Call Nev Schulman we're finding them. This isn't 15 ICP lol this would be awful. 

Let's see what we can do. All I would have to do is click "Spawn Neuron" and 7 days later I could donate around 12.14 ICP myself. I just would need more technically inclined individuals to come up with some kind of anonymous donation system maybe using already established crowdfunding dapp on the IC or just go old-fashioned gofundme lol 

Do not jump or "off" yourself... I'd give you 12 ICP and some change to come off *that* metaphoric proverbial ledge. Don't beat yourself up either...

Literally, go watch the 9+ seasons of Catfish the TV show on HULU and tell me you're the first one who's been duped on the internet. 


1. let's get a small team of people willing to donate time. 

2. We need to create the crowdfund itself 

3. someones gotta (besides you) has to run through with your investigator and have you okay with them and coordinate to do like a Facetime or Zoom or something to show the community, hey I'm Michael Stempien of the Stamford CT Police Department and this individual is real and this happened to them. Showing credentials and being able to verify they are law enforcement. Anything they are okay providing for this crowdfunding event that won't hurt their formal investigation. 

4. that's gotta be all over your site and the crowdfund itself. 

5. Let's make a forum post to gauge this audience and try to find others with other social media like Facebook twitter etc., etc... I do not have or use those. 

6. start collecting in multiple forms of currency all converting to ICP at time of donation. Let's make it clear we are not replacing a dollar amount and raising an ICP amount for more or less USD 15000 ICP is 15000 ICP not 15000 USD

I feel awful so with what free time I have I'll do what I can if this is something you want to consider.

I think having someone (or multiple people) reach out to the department and detective/ investigator and having you okay with them to disclose what they feel comfortable sharing. Perhaps a group call with multiple donors, the investigator, and like links proving their credentials and active status as a law enforcement officer or whatever their formal title will be... That would speak volumes IMO

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-05-29 23:50:23 UTC | #30

Wow! I can't thank you enough. I'll reach out to the investigator and see what he can give me to prove things. Like I said, I could never thank you enough! Thanks again.
Maybe, if there are 150 ICP holders willing to donate, that would show enough support to create the freezing feature? Which would help in recompensing the donors.

If this is your guy he looks like you got the right help... Just saying... I'd be down meeting him with as many others as it takes to start getting an audience to take it seriously and donate. Even if it means you wait a bunch of 7-day periods for donations of maturity. 

You'll have to excuse my humor or wit throughout this... I've been worried myself about being dupped into donating my maturity. So, we are learning together lol It's not directed at you I just imagine you need to laugh at this point. I mean it is been 27/28 days now. 

Take a pooper and breathe lol I'll stand on the corner collecting spare ICP if I have to ;) 

We still gotta get the a**hole though and let him know he just robbed 150 of us and get them on the phone and be like

I'd be less worried about recompensating donors and more worried about getting them caught and held accountable. That could be out of our hands. It would just be a bonus if he is caught, the ICP or funds returned and then donors get the funds. Maybe they'd leave the funds and make a foundation/ scholarship type fund to keep fighting cyber-related crimes in the community and support the victims of these stupid d holes

I would be focused on getting this guy and holding him accountable for the rest of my life.

Let's connect via DM's and I'll just share everything I find and we can try to get started on a forum post or something just to get the ball rolling... Connecting with them directly might take time... 

I think we can at the least start working on the next forum posts for crowdfunding, or finding individuals in the community with the technical skills to create preferably a simple anonymous donation function. I'm checking out https://funded.app/ as we speak to try and set up a little something something lol Assuming they (your investigator) get back to you soon we can just throw it in the crowdfund and the forum post and just start trying to widen the audience from there. If we can get a few of the right people to share it and see the validity I think we could come up with it. Even if it's micro-donations or over the next 6 months or longer. I know longer is out of the timeframe and then he could cash out... but if we just let it ride at least there's a chance I know I'd throw in more than once so 



Let's connect and give it the old college try...

I wonder if we could get 150 to donate and then have him be charged with 150 counts of whatever, or essentially say he robbed not just you but then everyone who donated. Really give our government the chance to earn our annual taxes lol

Onadrac | 2024-05-30 14:08:05 UTC | #38

There's an ICP enthusiast and influencer who's been very helpful and supportive of me. For which I'm very grateful. He's mentioned that there's already app that we may be able to use. https://funded.app/
Do you have any experience with it?

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-05-30 14:25:54 UTC | #39

I've been thinking about what you've suggested. And how about this? What if we were to ask ICP holders who are interested in helping to let us know. And then, at a certain point, we would have a solid number. And then, once that's been established, all of the people who put their hat in the ring would be able to vote as to whether they want to do this, or not. That way, if there's only 25 people, and it doesn't look likely, and the cost would be too much per person, then it's not happening. But if there's a large amount of volunteers and the cost is not too much per person, then the participants would likely to be more comfortable with it. And their vote would reflect that.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-05-30 17:04:16 UTC | #40

I just started poking around on funded last night. I created a temp. Twitter and am just walking through the process to see how complicated it would be. I struggle with the donations going to a wallet attached to any individual. I wish it were a community dao situation that required a few people to sign off on and no one person has access to it. Like the nuke football codes lol just cause I don’t want anyone else stealing from you… I also like your idea of having a  pre vote or something to see how many people are interested and willing… cause in funded I could make several tiers of NFTS to have purchased but I want to make sure we do the math right wink wink nudge nudge John ahem 15000 not 1500. Also, I want to double check that no one person has to first pay taxes on donations then donate. I’d hate to setup the crowdfund in a even a trusted member and have all these donations be stuck to their SSN or taxable events and then have to either take money out for taxes or pay the taxes themselves. That would be a tough burden… unless of course it end up being you in control and the taxable event occurs on you (if agreed). Maybe you ask your tax advisor or investigator if this type of thing would create a taxable event. I would hate to end up having you be overtaxed or incurred a tax bill that just eats at anything donated.

This project/ circumstance in particular is honestly an amazing learning experience especially with what I personally am trying to create down the road. If for this scenario we can finagle a good anonymous system it would really help me make the next move on my long term project. So, this is really a needing out scenario for me. 

Also, I’m taking serious notes of how even an experienced developer or investor like yourself could be manipulated and I’m using this as an opportunity to come up with better practices myself. 





I think moving forward, you’re right, we should do a community vote or get some feedback from well known members and ask if they’d be kind enough to help share and legitimize the fundraiser. Especially if those individuals get a chance to physically see the investigator either on a recorded message or something and we can all validate this experience happened and is real. Then have the more prolific members help (if they offer or are comfortable doing so). 

Then we should get another person or two with some free time to maybe pitch on the technical side of things, maybe someone with some creative talent? Probably not the biggest concern… and then a small group meeting or on here somewhere to coordinate together and just jump right in. 

How do you want to start the initial conversation or first survey of people interested or willing to take part if/when all the formal proof or investigator does the video or whatever…? We could do a forum survey or something similar up to you…

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-05-30 18:03:02 UTC | #41

Those are all good points that you're considering. It's good to have them in mind as early as possible. It's also good to hear that this could be such a learning experience for you, in regard to your project. It's always good to find the positive in something.
As far as the initial conversation, when the time's right, it might be best to start with a forum survey to get a feel for the community's view/feelings about this. What do you think?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-05-31 00:53:13 UTC | #42

I moved to DM until the next formal post... so other members don't get ticked off by this long-winded conversation lol

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-06-02 06:03:45 UTC | #43

@diegop can you help me track down a couple of questions related to the [patent](https://patents.justia.com/patent/20200286049) as it pertains to this scenario and forum thread/individual issue? 

The patent on the government system on the IC looks like it should be able to create the feature of a freeze function. 

The patent also suggests that the IC can moderate itself and remove illegal content correct?

If this individual can prove (have their investigator reach out and provide adequate information on the cybercrime and prove its validity) would it not be a reasonable request for this individual to ask the NNS to actively seize the stake of a poorly performing service provider? (see Moderation section) 

"Moderation allows the blockchain community to police itself. The community can vote to seize stake of a poorly performing service provider, de-register a service provider, or boot a service provider from the active set. In the context of storage, this could also be used to delete illegal content from a blobber" 

(SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF SELF-ADMINISTERED PROTOCOLS ON A BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM, Retrieved on June 2nd, 2024)

if this becomes a "poorly performing neuron" due to it being stolen and therefore presumably won't be voting during its dissolve period. Would it not be safe to assume the NNS *could* seize the stake?

Who gets to say what a poorly performing neuron is? the ones who actively vote or vote by following? 

What is or who is defined as a service provider? If the service provider is considered a stakeholder then this individual would be considered a service provider and stakeholder however, if the assets and their II were stolen would the NNS not have the ability to seize that II and respective asset? Or would this require an actual legal request? If so, what's the point of the NNS or governing system in place for the sake of governance at all?


Who defines what content or dapp/ blobber is considered illegal and then must be removed or seized? Can anything running on a node in the USA be taken down? Can the USA request a dapp running on a node in say China or Switzerland be taken down due to its content being illegal in the USA? However, in China or Switzerland, it's okay so is there a way to block users? or is it that if sent a request to take down illegal content needs to be met with the immediate removal of the content in *any* of the locations of the nodes?

Or can the boundary nodes limit what countries have access to what dapps? 

Furthermore, if node providers are able to see all of the data hosted on their respective nodes/ data centers wouldn't it be safe to assume that those data providers could be held liable, or are at serious risk if they don't comply? 

Should this individual request his investigator submit a request to freeze the stake and asset based on all of the above? 


"Feature Requests. Beyond configuration changes or moderation, the community may wish to make more sweeping changes to the blockchain protocol. Our voting mechanism can also be used for these changes, though it is advisory only."

This section as well...

He could ask the community for the feature... but would he really need to? or since he's in the USA and this patent pertains *to* Dfinity USA... He could just have authorities reach out and ask the community to seize this stake right?

Would appealing as a poorly performing neuron make this easier? Will their inactive voting since it was stolen be enough and have enough time to have the community say, "okay its poorly performing we can now actively seize it." 

Or, just flat out seize it as "illegal content" much like a blobber would have the canisters and node seized if it were part of a larger illegal operation


Final note... if the the NNS operates outside the scope of the patent established by the third-party developer hired/ used for the consensus mechanism would they then possibly forfeit their rights to the original patent design? 

Then anyone could quickly file a patent with the same design label it their design and if they submit it before the third-party developer it could be problematic. 

You'd think I wouldn't have to ask all this but there are bad actors everywhere...

this is all for educational purposes

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-06-02 05:03:37 UTC | #44

If the IC/Dfinity no longer are affiliated or use the technology stated in this patent I apologize...


For what it's worth... this is one of the many reasons I advocate for some type of legal rep. on the forum. Just would be great to *not* to pester you about it... but have (what I feel are) valid questions answered...

re: diegop I like your point/question here. What's the point of the NNS or governing system in place for the sake of governance at all? All the NNS can do is verify what I'm claiming and just tell me "Sorry. We can't help you." Well, then who can?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2024-06-03 11:44:19 UTC | #46

Yeah… it’s all about having people respond. Most people don’t like what I say on the forum because it’s all legal nonsense and this community thinks the tech can be a solid work around from idk governments that have been bending people over for 100s of years not since 2016 or a little before


Honestly the point of the governance system and all these little “toys” on the IC is for show… no ones willing to test them in court except dom so who knows if any of what’s done here will hold up in court. 

Also, I’m all about learning how to copyright my work, looking into having my work patented and covering myself legally… so


Find all the patent info you can on the mechanisms in place for the IC read them over and see how each is applied to your situation give that to your investigator. Especially the consensus mechanisms in place. Don’t use anything “wiki” related where anyone can pitch in. Get verified legal documents that were filed with the US patent services anything copyrighted and protected. Read it all and give that


Final note. Don’t think the government or agencies are going to be any more helpful. Prepare to be bent over by them as well. I mean either ways you’re about to get fd
