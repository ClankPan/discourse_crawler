So I either have an infinite loop or a bunch of Debug.prints inside of a highly iterated loop.  Is there a way to stop dfx, clear the pending transaction queue and restart without doing --clean?  If I cancel dfx and restart it tries to run the transaction again and I get the same wall of text.  It is a pain to have to redeploy all my canisters in just the right order so they get the same ID.  Maybe a feature request?  Also...yes...I'll stop writing infinite loops.ðŸ˜¬
