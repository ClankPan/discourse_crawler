Hi, I recently made an Internet Identity Anchor and when I try to enter my anchor number the NNS always ask me to verify through security key.

Last time I remember I was only given a seed phrase to recover and I never used any security keys.

Please help, guys...

Would be helpful to mention what kind of device you are trying to use, and if you have multiple devices used for login.
If it is a MacBook then try to restart as that helped with other people.

-------------------------

z3z3 | 2022-02-06 12:21:35 UTC | #3

I used Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 with Android 11

I don't use other device at all

I had this issue yesterday.

**There is a simple fix: restart your computer (no joke).**

If that does not work, please post here and please let us know.

If it does, definitely post here anyways!

I've tried to reboot my phone many times but I stuck to this page again and again.

What should I do?

Ok let me ping the relevant folks in team who may know more.

Many thanks @diegop ... Do you guys know anyone from DFINITY to contact about this particular matter?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-02-07 13:15:05 UTC | #9

I pinged them, but can you please make a ticket here so so someone from Dfinity can help help your particular case: https://support.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us/requests/new 

You can link this forum thread and also mention me.

Hi @z3z3 ! I've contributed a bit to Internet Identity, let me see how I can help. Can you clarify how you created your anchor? 

>  I recently made an Internet Identity Anchor and when I try to enter my anchor number the NNS always ask me to verify through security key.

You say you created an anchor; how did you create it? Did you create it on the same device you're trying to now authenticate with, i.e. the one you posted a screenshot of? Did you use biometrics or a FIDO device like a Yubikey?

> Last time I remember I was only given a seed phrase to recover

Do you mean that you were asked to copy the seedphrase during the anchor creation? That seedphrase shouldn't be used for day-to-day things like login to the NNS dapp.

-------------------------

z3z3 | 2022-02-07 16:42:06 UTC | #11

Here's the chronology:

I've only used 1 device (my Xiaomi Redmi Note 10) to sign up via NNS App installed on OS Android 11. It was Friday 4th February 2022.

After I got my Internet Identity anchor number, the seed phrase was only shown to me on my phone screen and I wrote them down on paper then clicked the copy button.

I remember that I only used my phone's fingerprint sensor to authenticate. Once I managed to log in, I sent some ICP coins from my other wallet to my NNS wallet address then staked them for 1 year+.

Yesterday (6th February 2022) I tried to log in again using my phone (yes, the same phone)  and I found out that the NNS App asked me for security keys via Bluetooth or USB connection.

That's why I decided to start this new topic to get help from the forum.

-------------------------

z3z3 | 2022-02-07 16:44:30 UTC | #12

Many thanks @diegop , I'll try your suggestion. It really means a lot for me.

-------------------------

nmattia | 2022-02-07 18:08:53 UTC | #13

Thanks a lot, this is really useful!

I'm going to assume you used the same browser on Feb 4th and Feb 6th. It looks like the Redmi Note 10 may have cleared its [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide) credentials store. This is basically a local database that contains the key for your Internet Identity login, and that database is unlocked when you use the fingerprint reader. This issue of the store getting wiped is known to happen on Safari, but I hadn't heard of Android browsers doing this on their own (I'm assuming you didn't clear your browser data manually).

If my assumption is correct then the problem should be fixed by re-adding the device. This is the process:

* Login using your recovery phrase that you copied (using the "Lost access  and want to recover?" button) 
* Re-enroll your device (click "Add new device" and follow the steps)

That _should_ allow you to login via fingerprint again. If after that the issue surfaces again then we'll need to look deeper and figure out why your browser keeps wiping its webauthn credentials store...

-------------------------

z3z3 | 2022-02-08 13:58:26 UTC | #14

Today I tried one suggestion to recover by adding a new device (using the same Xiaomi Redmi 10 Phone and it's fingerprint sensor)... and it magically worked 😅!

I'm glad now that I can access again my NNS App wallet but I think it's kind of a weird solution for me as Internet Identity user to use the same device and had to register it as a new device.

-------------------------

nmattia | 2022-02-08 14:03:26 UTC | #15

Well I'm glad it worked! It's really surprising that the webauthn credential store got wiped. Please let us know if this happens again!

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-02-09 13:47:38 UTC | #16

Hello, I have a question about login to the NNS.

Since today I can no longer log into my NNS wallet (https://nns.ic0.app/v2/) on a MacBook and my current Chrome browser.

I was supposed to use a USB stick for my security key, but in the past I didn't need a USB stick for login.

Did I miss something there?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-02-09 14:08:51 UTC | #17

No, you did not miss anything. We have seen user reports on this. But fix is simple: can you please restart your MacBook? It should work then. 

If it does or does not fix it, can you let this tread know please?

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-02-09 14:40:05 UTC | #18

huch, after a restart of my MacBook the login works as expected :sweat_smile:

Thank you for the hint.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-02-09 14:58:38 UTC | #19

Glad to hear it worked!

-------------------------

Just wanted to add another datapoint to this thread: android phone running android 10, latest chrome version, had the same "use usb key" thing happen. A reboot solved the problem, and authenticating with fingerprint now works again.

-------------------------

segunbvmc | 2022-04-18 21:09:25 UTC | #22

Having the same issue, but the solution provided here is not working, any other solution will be appreciated, using redmi note 10 pro

-------------------------

segunbvmc | 2022-04-19 07:45:46 UTC | #23

If one mistakenly cleared the data, what's the solution?

-------------------------

GLdev | 2022-04-19 20:23:39 UTC | #24

You can restore access using either a seed phrase, or another connected device, as long as it was originally connected to the same anchor id with the phone.

-------------------------

segunbvmc | 2022-04-20 15:15:48 UTC | #25

Tried that but all I get is that the seed phrases are not correct, I am fed up, I need to access my distrikt app.

-------------------------

segunbvmc | 2022-04-20 15:23:12 UTC | #26

I use the same backup phrase to restore my account with icpswap and it worked, I don't know why I am having this difficulty with restoring my anchor with the same set of phrases

Failed to find an identity for the Identity Anchor 138312. Please check your Identity Anchor and try again. This is what i kept on getting

Uthman-droid | 2022-11-13 16:41:01 UTC | #28

I've been trying to login to my dscvr, distrikt and openchat portals for the past two weeks but all to no avail. The issue has been with authenticating with internet Identity, I've been getting an error message that goes thus "failed to fetch identity anchor "126384". I normally authenticate with my fingerprint, but it no longer bring the option for me to use my fingerprint

I have not been able to log into my Distrikt account for two months now. I also tried recovering my account using my recovery phrase but it's still not not working. Please help.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-11-19 06:16:39 UTC | #30

Hi @ufuomaesther is this still the case?

Does II work on other dapps? Or no dapp? Any information may be helpful.

-------------------------

Darf | 2022-11-27 21:55:06 UTC | #31

I'm struggling with this too, I created an Identity Anchor on my iphone but now wish to begin staking using the anchor and my mac.  I'm wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction please...

On my mac, i'm going to nns.ic0.app and hitting "sign in with internet identity".  You have to enter your anchor (which I set up on my iphone), then I select "use phone with QR code".  This is the part that gets stuck.  I've ensured that both the iphone and mac bluetooth is on but I cannot connect.  I've followed the only piece of advice that I can find on this matter and thats to restart my mac.   Any ideas please.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-11-28 08:53:18 UTC | #32

Hey @Darf – welcome to the forum! The easiest way of achieving what you describe is:
- Using your phone, go to [identity.ic0.app](https://identity.ic0.app/) and sign in.
- On the management screen, choose "+ add new device",
- select "remote device"
- follow the on-screen instructions.

Hope that helps, let me know if it doesn't.

Hello guys. I lost my phone, and i have been trying to recovee it. I have the Identity anchor and the seed phrase, but all attempts have been fruitless. Is there any special thing i need to do apart from just writing the information when prompted to do so?

What exactly did I need to do to recover my dscvr account? I have followed all the steps giving to me but still I keep getting this "invalid data" (it looks like you were sent here for authentication, but no service requested authentication). This is the respond I always get.

-------------------------

Ang | 2023-01-02 13:12:33 UTC | #48

Have you updated to the latest version of chrome and android OS? Have you tried recovering your account using a different device? Do you have your full recovery phrase? Can you please clarify what exactly you were doing prior to seeing this notification?

Ang this is an ancient thread but am hoping my questions will still reach you.
I created an Anchor on my Samsung Android phone and at the time of creating it I had only the seed phrase. I don't have a physical device like a Yubikey not have I ever ventured into Bio authentication (pre-internet brain here). I sent my ICP tokens to my ICP wallet but am getting a bit nervous about what would happen if I lost my phone somehow: would I still be able to access my wallet? Would the seed phrase be enough?
Second (!) I have just created a new Anchor on my laptop. Because it is the phone of my original anchor I was hoping that my wallet from my phone would appear, but of course it hasn't. In order to accessing my wallet that is via my phone on the laptop, do I have to buy a Yubikey or other hardware device? 
I hope the above (muddle!) is clear enough. I'd be v grateful for any help you or anyone could give. I have even been contemplating just sending my tokens back to Binance out of concern I will lose access to my wallet.

-------------------------

Ang | 2023-04-11 14:15:13 UTC | #50

If you have a recovery phrase you should be able to recover the account in the event you lost your phone.

Does your laptop have biometric authentication or windows hello? If it does then you would not need to buy a yubikey or external security key in order to authorized your laptop in order to access the same anchor and wallet currently tied to your phones.

-------------------------

thcbdmt | 2023-08-10 19:16:49 UTC | #51

Set up internet identity with phone now only way to access is with passphrase. It wont ask for fingerprint or usb or anything. If you want to be accepted as anything but a scam you need to provide better usability and support. Where is the documentation/tutorials etc.
I have a brand new device with fingerprint and face recognition HOW DO I USE  IT ON THE INTERNET COMPUTER ???????

-------------------------

Ang | 2023-08-10 19:21:51 UTC | #52

There is documentation and help center available here to assist with creating a new internet identity. If you need additional support you can also send an email to support@dfinity.org: https://identitysupport.dfinity.org/

I have the same problem on my new phone can't login without usb or passkey still have old phone but this is a concern as i locked in desolving the full 8 years so this makes me anxious i won't be able to login on some future device. 
Please advise?

-------------------------

bjoern | 2024-02-05 08:04:28 UTC | #54

Have you added your new device to your II yet? You can do this as follows:
- using your old device, go to the [II frontend](https://identity.ic0.app/) and select your II number
- once you see the management interface, choose "add new passkey" and follow the flow described there

That flow will enroll your new device as a second authorized device to your II, and after this step, you can use either device to access the NNS front-end dapp to manage your neurons (or actually any other dapp you use with II).

I suggest you also setup a recovery mechanism; either a recovery phrase, or if you happen to have a Ledger Nano, you can also install the FIDO U2F app on there and use it as a recovery device.

-------------------------
