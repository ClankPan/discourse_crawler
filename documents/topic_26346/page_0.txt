Hello everyone,

We are preparing for the upcoming launch of the ICLighthouse DAO (ICDex)  on the SNS. This marks a significant advancement in our endeavors at ICLighthouse.

**ICLighthouse DAO**

Initiated on the Internet Computer SNS system, the ICLighthouse DAO is a community-driven governance model overseeing ICDex and icRouter. Our goal is to create a leading DeFi framework and a dynamic ecosystem on the IC blockchain, merging traditional financial principles with blockchain innovation.

**ICDex**

As a key component of the ICLighthouse DAO, ICDex is a decentralized,  fully on-chain order book DEX built on the IC blockchain. Its development is community-driven, guided by governance through the ICLighthouse DAO SNS.

This launch not only enhances ICL's utility but also empowers our users to influence the direction of our company and platforms. Your input will shape the future of our updates and projects.

For more details, please see our whitepaper: [ICLighthouse Whitepaper](https://iclight.house/whitepaper.pdf).

We're here for any questions and will keep you updated on future developments.

Dear IC lighthouse, 

many thanks for the heads-up on your planned SNS launch!

You are probably aware, but just in case: On this wiki [page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration) you can find information and the SNS tokenomics analyzer tool for assessing SNS configurations (e.g. with respect to the distribution of voting power).

I have some old ICL, what will it look like when the new ICL launchpades

-------------------------

For a long time, I wanted to buy NFT, which has 1200 ICL rights, from the yummi platform. However, my registration with personal information on the yummi platform was not successful. Even though they said they sent me an e-mail, I was not receiving any e-mail. Because of these ridiculous systems, the trading capacity of the platform decreases. But they don't care. Finally we will have a chance to buy icl tokens from the icdex platform

Congratulations!
But to make things clear: can you guys explain the softcap and hardcap for the SNS sale as well?
Went into the whitepaper but did not find this info.
Thanks.

source code repository?

-------------------------

memecake | 2024-01-09 17:02:01 UTC | #7

Quick question - has the dApp been audited? If not, when do you plan to conduct an audit?

-------------------------

memecake | 2024-01-09 17:22:35 UTC | #8

Listing a few more questions here - 

Seed round (7%): In 2023, the team completed a seed round of financing targeted at specific entities.- **Who is the entity?** 
**Is this an Opensource project?**
**When do you plan to release the audit report?**

-------------------------

Antony | 2024-01-09 17:50:27 UTC | #9

They don't need audit, Its an insider project. All codes are safe and secured .

-------------------------

endingsearch4u | 2024-01-09 17:55:06 UTC | #10

what will  be the developement after the SNS ? 

What changes are planned to compete to the likes of uniswap , quick swap , or many other when they enter into ICP ecosystem ?

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-01-09 19:12:27 UTC | #11

We (Solidstate) are currently in the process of auditing ICDex, so there will be a full formal audit completed!

Good to hear that. Excited for the SNS

-------------------------

coin_master | 2024-01-11 23:18:20 UTC | #16

It doesn’t seem the frontend is open-sourced though?

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2024-01-13 11:55:04 UTC | #17

It will also be open source soon.

To promote decentralization, we encourage users to deploy their own front-ends.

How can I exchange ICL dip20 to ICL ICRC1 in 1:1 ratio?

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2024-01-17 15:17:32 UTC | #20

Currently circulating ICLs will be converted 1:1 within one quarter of the successful launch of the SNS.

Hi @simpson,

great to see IC Lighthouse taking the route towards an SNS.  I've been finally reading your whitepaper. I like the idea of the DAO Board that can execute selected administrative functions on time. Did you take some other project (from another ecosystem) as a role model for this?

Can you already share the (link to) `sns_init.yaml` to be able to check your parameters with the SNS Tokenomics Analyzer tool?

-------------------------

infu | 2024-01-18 12:25:55 UTC | #22

There is something similar, but with a different purpose. Curve's Emergency DAO. <https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-ownership.html>
This could work through the SNS as well. The SNS-governed canister hosts an SNS-elected board. The canister has a neuron, and it votes based on the board's decision. It needs other neurons to follow the board neuron on specific generic functions, with over 50% support for proposals to be accepted faster.

After the version is stabilized, it will be open-sourced and a standard UI will be provided. i think it will be easy for other eco-projects to use this module.

We will publish `sns_init.yaml` soon。

I have been deeply thinking about this topic, and reached a different structure (that has pros and cons).

- The SNS controls a "Board Canister" and the version uploaded to it.
- The SNS controls "assign / unassign" of members and a "recover control of assets" custom method.
- Assets can be under the direct control of "SNS" or "Board". (like a non-relevant asset can be updated directly by the board, without the need of SNS intervention (but still transparent and auditable)).
- The version uploaded, then allows it's "assigned members" to do actions through it's methods, pretty much a list of "pre-aproved" set of "board level" tasks.

This way, a few advantages are:
- Members are elected and easily "swapped".
- The list of actions and it's scope, are controlled and pre-approved by the SNS, but the decision and moment of it's calling, is left to the members of the group.
- It allows for much more custom approval process than the SNS one.

Hope it's useful in any way. :slight_smile:

Hey guys, In order to comply with the SNS launch rules, we modified the whitepaper to increase the "SNS Swap" token allocation to 30% and shed light on some of the questions that people have had. 

Btw the `sns_init.yaml` please check [here](https://github.com/iclighthouse/sns-icl/blob/main/sns_init.yaml)

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-01-25 04:19:07 UTC | #26

Hi @domwoe , for `sns_init.yaml` please check [here](https://github.com/iclighthouse/sns-icl/blob/main/sns_init.yaml)

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-11 05:55:27 UTC | #27

We are very pleased to share our audit report with you: https://github.com/solidstate-auditing/audits-public/blob/main/ICDex.md

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2024-02-19 09:12:47 UTC | #28

Any update on the "Testing & Verification" part ?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2024-02-21 12:22:31 UTC | #29

Hey @simpson,

Is this still the up-to-date SNS config file? I just checked and it assigns 66.5% voting power to the developer neuron after a successful swap. I assume this was by accident.

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-22 08:22:07 UTC | #30

Hey @domwoe , Thanks for the heads up. The github version for the `developer neuron` is test, we'll update the full list of `developer neuron` later

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-22 08:22:57 UTC | #31

Thanks for the support, we have completed the beta testing and will be launching it as soon as possible!

-------------------------

EnzoPlayer0ne | 2024-02-22 10:06:27 UTC | #32

Does that mean there will still be 66.5% voting power spread out among the team of developers or that the stake of the developers' team as a whole will be reduced?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2024-02-23 09:13:46 UTC | #33

FYI, the proposal is now live: https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=128084

-------------------------

domwoe | 2024-02-23 12:31:22 UTC | #34

@simpson The voting power of developer neurons is very close to 50% (49.6%). In addition, a number of these neurons, which you dedicate to seed investors, don't have a vesting period. Theoretically, these neurons could immediately raise their dissolve delay to 2 years, which would give the developer neurons (team + seed investors) 57.8% of the voting power.

In such a scenario one would expect the dev neurons voting power to be reasonably lower instead of just barely meeting the threshold.

-------------------------

Antony | 2024-02-23 16:16:56 UTC | #35

I am about to point out the same issue, There is only a max of 6 month dissolve delay for seed investors which you guys allocated 7% tokens.

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-24 07:02:25 UTC | #36

Hey mate @domwoe @Antony. The team and seed investors are not acting in concert, and 15% of the tokens are vesting period for 6 months.

We don't think there is much point in controlling this percentage of voting rights, if the "team + seed investors" really want to have absolute voting power, they just need to buy a portion of the token in the "Swap".

-------------------------

coin_master | 2024-02-24 09:46:42 UTC | #37

**We are still missing the open sourced frontend code**

This should be mandatory in all SNS's as we should be able to verify the frontend code as well as the backend.
Is it open sourced somewhere I am missing?

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-24 12:32:32 UTC | #38

Hey mate, this is the frontend code: https://github.com/iclighthouse/ICDexUI and this is the backend code: https://github.com/iclighthouse/ICDex

-------------------------

coin_master | 2024-02-24 17:05:31 UTC | #39

Thank you, I appreciate all the great work you guys are doing.

-------------------------

tomimas1990 | 2024-02-26 16:43:31 UTC | #41

hello-
this ICLighthouse DAO coin will be like the UNI uniswap dex token, only for DAO?
swaps will still be paid in ICP? 
-thx

-------------------------

molokanov50 | 2024-02-27 07:53:44 UTC | #42

I have some ICL dip20 tokens. What should be my actions in order to perform their conversion to icrc1 tokens?

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-27 08:56:59 UTC | #43

Hi mate, ICL is used for Fee Rate Strategy Orders, IDO Proposal Voting, OAMM Creation Proposals, VIP-maker Qualification Proposals, and Project Governance, etc. Refer to Section 4 of the whitepaper for details.

-------------------------

simpson | 2024-02-27 08:58:31 UTC | #44

The team will open the conversion portal after the launch of the sns, so stay tuned for our latest news.

-------------------------

tomimas1990 | 2024-02-28 17:23:12 UTC | #45

thanks for the clarification.

-------------------------

Kajalishu | 2024-06-21 15:55:38 UTC | #46
