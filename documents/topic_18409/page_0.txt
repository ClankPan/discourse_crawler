For some reason a process fails to execute but only on mainnet and although I've managed to peer through the black box somewhat via `assert()`,  whose error messages on the browser tell you the line where things went wrong, the lack of print statements on mainnet makes it a bit of a dark room to debug, especially with medium-large codebases or processes that call several functions. 

How have you dealt with it?

I've done self-`await`s that write to a ringbuffer in my canister that I can then query. Pretty hacky solution, but it got me far enough to solve my issues

I like it.

One thing I've found useful is having a debug button in the HTML that calls a debug function in the backend, and change the content of that function depending on what I'm looking at / doesn't work.
