I think this is a great idea - I wonder how the discourse forum search functionality would work with this.


I did a brief search and saw that discourse has a translator plugin https://www.discourse.org/plugins/translator.html

Looks like there’s also this Chinese localization pack.

https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-chinese-localization-pack/41175

Probably would be good to get someone from DFINITY to comment here - it’s great to have more language support, but want to make sure it isn’t jarring for the user experience if the translator isn’t good and there are like 4+ languages all over the forums.

Maybe @zire can comment further on any documentation/forum localization plans.
