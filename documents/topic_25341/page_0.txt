Dear All,

Recently, the DFINITY security team uncovered a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in the Candid library, which when exploited can degrade canisterâ€™s performance. We urge everyone who is currently on version `>= 0.9.0` to `< 0.9.10` of candid rust library to upgrade to the latest version of candid as soon as possible. A security advisory has been published on [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/security/advisories/GHSA-7787-p7x6-fq3j), which contains a detailed description of the issue. For asset canister users (bundled with dfx), if you are on dfx versions `>= 0.14.4 to <= 0.15.2-beta.0` please upgrade your dfx to `v0.15.2` and redeploy your asset canister.

All affected canisters developed by DFINITY have already been upgraded to the fixed version. Any canister with candid version `< 0.9.0` and `> 0.9.10` and all Motoko canisters are not affected. Asset canisters from dfx versions <= 0.14.3 are also not affected by the issue.

We encourage the ICP community to report any new issues or bugs found responsibly. Please refer to the [Bug Bounty](https://dfinity.org/bug-bounty/) program for more information.
