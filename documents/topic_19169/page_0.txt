Hey guys, I have set up domain and registered everything works well but I have a single problem whereby the `access-control-allow-methods` doesn't have the `POST` method, so all my `POST` requests are rejected since they are not allowed. It will be great if someone can help add the `POST` method to my custom domain. 
For more information, I am posting the part of the registration status for my canister

``` 
Connection state changed (MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS == 256)!
< HTTP/2 200
< server: nginx/1.21.3

< access-control-expose-headers: Accept-Ranges,Content-Length,Content-Range
< access-control-max-age: 600

```
It will be great if anyone can point me to the right directions, Thanks

Hi!

Based on the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header you are seeing, it seems that you are referring to the [`/registrations/<id>`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/ic-os/boundary-guestos/rootfs/etc/nginx/conf.d/001-mainnet-nginx.conf#L291-L308)  endpoint, which really does not accept a POST request. The operations supported on that endpoint are:

1. [`GET /registrations/<id>`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/boundary_node/certificate_issuance/certificate_issuer/src/api.rs#L104-L141) - Retrieve information about an existing registration, including it's name, canister ID and status.
2. [`PUT /registrations/<id>`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/boundary_node/certificate_issuance/certificate_issuer/src/api.rs#L143-L205) - Allows one to trigger an update to the canister ID associated with their custom domain, assuming certain prerequisites are met (the appropriate DNS record has been updated).
3. [`DELETE /registrations/<id>`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/boundary_node/certificate_issuance/certificate_issuer/src/api.rs#L208-L264) - Allows one to trigger a removal of their custom domain from the IC altogether, assuming certain prerequisites are met (all relevant DNS records are removed, etc).

As for a `POST` request, that would indeed be allowed on the [`/registrations`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/boundary_node/certificate_issuance/certificate_issuer/src/api.rs#L35-L102) endpoint, to create a registration for a new custom domain.

Are you referring to making a POST request on your _actual_ canister? Happy to try to assist, just let me know if you have any clarifications.

Thanks for answering back, I am talking POST request on the actual canister by using the custom domain that I registered. I tried to do `curl -sLv` for my canister domain, the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` also has a missing `POST` request.

Hi @itsyaasir, would you mind providing the curl that you're using?
