Happy Friday, community!

In preparation for our Tungsten Developer Network launch next week, the team here at DFINITY held a two-day internal hackathon in mid-June! Almost half of the entire organization participated, with 13 registered teams across five different time zones.

We have curated some of our favorite apps and projects from our 48-hour hackathon in our newly-created [awesome-dfinity repo](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity) - something we hope to grow and evolve with your help in the coming weeks and months!

Check out the full story and a deep-dive into some of our favorite projects on [Medium](https://medium.com/dfinity/internet-computer-tungsten-hackathon-developer-network-launch-9714cd891632)!

Which of these apps are you most excited to see running on Tungsten? :rocket:
