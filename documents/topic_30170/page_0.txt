I've wasted too many hours trying to just build a hello world "website". I'd be happy if I can just deploy something that displays one character :slight_smile: 

I'm wondering, how long do people think it'll be before someone creates an easy website builder like Squarespace, Duda, Webflow, or a CMS like WordPress for ICP (with website building capabilities like WP - I realize there is Nuance)?

And it would need something more than just creating a website, the ability to get the code into the canister would make it complete. I can use examples to create things, but, I can't get the code into the canister.

I'm well versed in traditional website setup stuff like FTP, cPanel, DNS records and all that.. I logged into Juno to see how hard it would be to host a simple static website on the ICP, and was **completely lost**.. Given all appearances, it seems you have to be a coder to be able to host a website on IC.

In the existing infrastructure, I can use a tool for designing my site, and have it export all the html and css files, then I upload them via ftp to a public_html folder on a Web server, create an A record in the DNS and the website is live without writing a line of code.

After looking at Juno, I cannot accomplish the same thing... I realize on chain websites are still in their infancy, but it will need to be a lot easier for adoption and allowing people to bypass web hosting services in favor of the ICP. Just my $0.02 from a layman non coder.

Like right now, I have the need to create some informational pages on some domains I own for my business and I thought ICP would be a great solution, but from what I've seen (unless I missed something) we're a long ways away from hosting websites on the IC for every day people like me.

Although this is totally possible on IC, I havent seen any CMS yet. A CMS on IC could also feature full ownership, tokenomics, community ownership and governance, micropayments, guarenteed privacy, superior security, e2e encryption, chain fusion etc.

Downsides and bottlenecks would be storage and compute costs are higher and hosting (uploading and downloading) large files and data is more tricky, but possible (read recently on twitter that one project had implemented their own CDN)

This means you need the right balance between web3 capabilities and CMS features to succeed with CMS on IC

Yes, same here. I used to manage several websites using WordPress. I used web development plugins such as Divi, Elementor, and Thrive Themes. At one point I even created an ecommerce website using PHP and PayPal. So, I'm not totally illiterate. It definitely seemed easier on web2.

Right now, I just can't get the code into the canister. 

The problem is that I created the canister using the NNS.

Then I tried using a tutorial that started from scratch and so it assumed there is no canister created. I figured that I should be able to continue from a point in the tutorial after the canister is created. But, I can't seem to do it.

Locally, the apps work, but, I can't seem to get the code into a pre-existing canister (that I own and funded).

Anyways, when I was younger, I would keep at it until I figured it out. But, nowadays, I don't feel like I have the time anymore.

I'm hoping some app will be created that makes it easier to deploy code as I also want to move to web3 and ICP.

I just met some folks from ICP at the Rare Evo event today. I'm building playfix do io which is a web3 site and dApp builder. We're going to add support for ICP to our site builder. I think this is a really cool opportunity! If you want to follow along you can find our discord on our site. We're giving early access to people now.

Hey we work constantly to bring websites on the IC. One outcome is our course: https://vspc.veriable.at/6513c18b1f66192cab8beb29.html and our blog: https://blog.icacademy.at.

Maybe I can light the space a bit. If you use a static site generator like Astro and a GitHub action you can automate the process efficiently.

@cypherspace In Modul 3 Option 2 you can find the steps for creating a canister using the NNS and linking it to your local development version which you can deploy into the NNS created canister.

There was one from icme labs but they shut it down when they pivoted to zk nova.

Yes, until a CMS gets developed, websites on ICP will be out of reach for the normal people. For mass adoption to occur this stuff needs to be easy.

It would be awesome to see support or even better built on top of Juno.build.

Someone or a couple of people need to build it on top of Juno. I like that Juno is focusing on building out the protocol.
