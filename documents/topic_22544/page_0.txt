Hi,

The link to the execution layer on this page of the docs:
https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/ic-overview#execution

Is to this URL (404 error):

https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/execution/

But instead it probably should be to this page:

https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/execution-layer/

Thanks.

Hey @eugaia, 

Thanks a lot for reporting the broken link. I just created a PR to fix it: https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/1872. In the future, if you come across something like that again, you can also make the changes yourself. Just fork [the repository](https://github.com/dfinity/portal), apply the changes and create a pull request. Note that at the bottom of each page, there is a little "Edit this page button" that takes you directly to the right file in the repository.
