dfinity should have a page of ICP hall of fame.
nns periodically votes for the best tech developed for ICP and put the dev's name on the hall of fame. like a nobel prize or something. this will incentivize devs more than the grants

While I don't necessarily agree on the form—like a Nobel Prize, it's a bit much to just write lines of code :wink:—it sounds to me like what most web tech companies do. For example, Google has a [Google Developer Experts](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) program, and likewise for [Ionic](https://ionic.io/developer-experts), etc. It's basically a way to have developer advocates across the world who promote your technology for free or with a minor investment.

I don't know if it's an activity blockchain projects generally do, nor if this really makes "ICP better" as the OP is mentioning, or if it's already something included in the ICP Hub strategy. However, from a web developer perspective, having a Developer Experts program and a related page would make sense.

In my dream, I wish we have something similar on Juno someday :smile:.

1st proposal:  some hall of fame for the community contributors to be officially recognised by the foundation. ignite their passion!
2nd proposal: it makes no difference to participate in the sns on the first minute or the last minute. to make the game more fun, the price can increase like a bonding curve. have a look of the Gram sale a few years ago. the Gram price increases for every Gram sold. this will be more fun for the market to find the valuation of the project. i would argue at least make this an option so the dev can decide either set min max fundraising targets by themselves or leave it to the market. 

both proposals are simple to implement but will increase the community engagement quite some.
