We are thrilled to announce a major milestone for Sonic: our decentralized exchange is **officially open source!** This marks a significant step forward for our platform and the broader ICP ecosystem, as Sonic becomes the first open-source DEX on the Internet Computer. 

As a team, we are deeply committed to transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By open-sourcing Sonic, we are inviting developers, researchers, and the wider community to contribute to the growth and development of our platform. We believe that open-source development fosters creativity, accelerates progress, and ultimately leads to more robust and secure solutions.

We are incredibly excited about the opportunities that open-sourcing Sonic presents, and we look forward to collaborating with the community to shape the future of decentralized finance on the Internet Computer. To access Sonic's open-source code and start contributing, please visit our GitHub repository https://github.com/sonicdex

We extend our heartfelt thanks to our community for their ongoing support. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of decentralized finance.

We are actively preparing for the submission of our SNS proposal, a significant milestone for our platform. For detailed information regarding the SNS proposal and its implications, we invite you to review our dedicated forum post on this topic.https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-sonic-sns-decentralization-sale/19716
