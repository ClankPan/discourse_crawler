In the dfx 0.8.5 version, the build is going great
dfx build error in conjunction with vessel starting from the 9th versions

The compiler points to the base library and the problem of converting to

> Prim.nat64ToNat(Prim.cyclesAvailable())

how can this be corrected?

I manually deleted `Prim.nat64ToNat` in the package and the project can be deployed.
