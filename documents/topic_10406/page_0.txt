Difiwallet

Hello everyone. I wanted to share my wallet here. And yes, it has open source code under the MIT license. Take a look and study at the link [https://github.com/fury02/Difiwallet](https://github.com/fury02/Difiwallet) .
Now it is used by the infrastructure as a Plug controller (Psychedelic). It is planned to add a few more, the first will be stoicwallet (if possible)
Advantages:
- - you can add it to existing multi wallets (React Native)
- - open for distribution ( MIT license)
- - the ability to quickly port to iOS

I have already submitted it to google play for review. And I will leave a link after the update.

Update 1.
