Solidstate Audit Kick-Off!

Per the process laid out in [Proposal #24](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=extk7-gaaaa-aaaaq-aacda-cai&proposal=24), upon the event of the proposal #24 being adopted [Solidstate](https://www.solidstateauditing.com/) was to convert the received ICP into USD and hold that USD on balance for the Neutrinite DAO audit, then submit a motion proposal to give the DAO transparency into this transaction.

This motion proposal is a confirmation from Solidstate that exactly $49,175.00 USD is being held on balance for the Neutrinite DAO audit!

Roughly 13 hours after receiving the 3,500 ICP from Neutrinite DAO, [Solidstate](https://www.solidstateauditing.com/)’s parent company ([Code & State](https://www.codeandstate.com/)) initiated an OTC trade to convert the 3,500 ICP into USD. Considering OTC desks usually only prefer to accept trades worth 6 figures or more, a ~10 cent spread fee was added due to this being considered a “small quantity OTC trade”.

You can view our OTC trade receipt here:

Please vote to adopt this motion proposal to avoid a proposal rejection penalty being applied.

Thank you for hiring Solidstate, we’re excited to be making history with you!

Sincerely,
