```
* Consensus: Build only the required ecdsa signatures
* Consensus: Change Consensus/ECDSA priority function
* Consensus: ECDSA transcript ref translation improvements
* Consensus: Reject ecdsa signature requests with invalid key_id
* Consensus: Use fixed size vector for ecdsa message_hash
* Crypto: Convert NIDKG enc_chunks from MIRACL to zkcrypto
* Crypto: Convert the NIDKG sharing proof from MIRACL to zkcrypto
* Crypto: Extract PRNG and tECDSA pubkey derivation into utility crates
* Crypto: Fix count of node keys appearance in metrics
* Crypto: Improved debug logging for tECDSA and iDKG
* Crypto: Make debug logging more efficient by using an ID and moving bulk information to debug statement
* Crypto: Remove MIRACL use from the NIDKG chunking proof
* Crypto: Remove KeyId as return value for key generation methods
* Crypto: Remove obsolete trusted client certificate store
* Execution: Bitcoin: Update variants in requests to comply with the spec.
* Execution: Add subnet_size scaling to refund_cycles method
* Message Routing: Change the log level of `execution queue overflow` in message routing to Debug
* Message Routing: Opening page map requires height
* Networking: Decrease significantly the Transport error space
* Networking: Flatten the Transport events.
* Networking: Instead of NodeRecord transport receives directly the SocketAddr of the peer.
* Networking: Rename some transport types
* Networking: Upgrade the mockall crate version used for the transport mock
* Networking: Use the the state_reader_executor instead of the state_reader_object for retrieving the root public key and get_random_node_from_nns_subnet
* Networking: Verifying Canister HTTP calls cannot go to replica nodes.
* Node: Duplicate SetupOS output to serial console
* Node: Fix compression of upgrade image
* Node: Fix root inode of /var
* Node: Migrate bootstrap config to adoc
* Node: Transfer logs and journalbeat state during upgrades
* Runtime: Change compute allocation fee
* Runtime: Flatten DTS states of `install_code`.
* Runtime: Move install_code helpers to install_code.rs
* Runtime: Require a target subnet for ECDSA initial dealings requests
* Runtime: Rewrite the response callback execution to support DTS aborts
* Runtime: Small refactoring of execution parameters
