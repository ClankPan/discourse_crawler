I'm wondering how I can have a custom domain name point to my Sodium frontend canister. I'm not sure how the certificates and such will work out. I just tried pointing my custom domain to xz3rs-wuaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q.ic0.app with an ALIAS record, and I'm getting errors from Cloudflare.

Seems that under-the-hood things a bit more complicated than normal, so I'd love some direction, thanks.
