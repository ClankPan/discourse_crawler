Hello,

I’m a UX Designer for Open-mesh, I’m currently conducting user testing for Xnode Studios - a platform for infrastructure design, development and management solutions where users can assemble Web2 and Web3 infrastructure like Lego blocks. 

If you would like to participate in the study I would be very grateful (it only takes 5 minutes):

Platform: https://www.openmesh.network/xnode/
Testing Document : https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SQ7SFDS

Thank you !!
