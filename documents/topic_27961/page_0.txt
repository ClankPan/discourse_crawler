I've had this idea for some time and now I'm more focused on it, I'd like to create this thread to cover updates in the form of checkpoints and summaries to get feedback from the community at all stages so the process would be more transparent. 

[CYQL](https://n7ib3-4qaaa-aaaai-qagnq-cai.raw.ic0.app/#/) idea of being a community-curated comprehensive db of projects and ecosystem "playground" is very well aligned with the concept of DAO which allows it to be well transitioned into it. By doing so, the project will get a bunch of superpowers like being unbiased, more comprehensive and complete, verified and up-to-date due to the community moderation. 

Why you even want so submit a project to the cyql? As it becomes more feature-rich, comprehensive, well recognised and trusted resource, the number of users will grow respectively, and for any project that would like to get an additional resource of views and recognition this opportunity will be very much available. Thereâ€™s also an idea to introduce an incentive system that will reward participants for a beneficial actions to the system, such as moderation or keeping the data up-to-date. 

The project currently along with the SNS preparation is in dev of a proof-of-concept which will allow anyone to moderate the project gallery and list projects. cyql has been supported by grants throughout its development and thanks dfinity for this support. 

Looking for devs and anyone interested in getting involved, there are many ideas of introducing new modules and features to the service. Motoko devs any level who would like to partner and get involved are very much welcomed to dm me on Discord [id tomkoom] or [Telegram](https://t.me/tomkoom). cyql repo has been always [open-sourced](https://github.com/tomkoom/cyql.io)

@tomkoom: Very cool, interesting project! :-) 

How does the curation process work? Does it make sure that there are no malicious imposter projects (i.e. DSOVR instead of DSCVR)?

The [identity and wallet standards working group](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication) is actually looking for exactly such a project to solve the issue of application metadata (see discussion [here](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication/issues/114#issuecomment-1943233077)).

If you are interested it would be great if you could join our next working group session on March 5.

Btw. https://cyql.io/ gives me a certificate error. You might want to fix that. :wink:

thx frederik, 
The curation process is intended to work the next way: the project data, such as links and any other information about the project will be submitted in the form of proposal, so voters and anyone will able to review it and decide if the project should be listed which help to validate it, so it will work as a crowd-verification. There will also be a possibility to update or archive the project through the proposal as well.

 Let me check that in more detail and I'll reach out to you. 

Thanks for pointing the cert error - fixed.
