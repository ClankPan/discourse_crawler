Hello,

Motoko has a `Float` type, which provides base 2 decimals. Is there a particular type or library available that can support base 10 arbitrary precision decimals? I'm looking for functionality similar to the `bigdecimal` package in Rust: https://docs.rs/bigdecimal/latest/bigdecimal/

Not that I'm aware off.
