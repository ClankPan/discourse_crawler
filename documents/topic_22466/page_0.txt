**[Nuance](https://www.nuance.xyz)** www.nuance.xyz

It's been more than two years since we launched our alpha and today we are very proud to announce the campaign for Nuance to become a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO).

This post is for the community to discuss the Nuance SNS and ask the founding team any questions.

Nuance is the world's first publishing platform built entirely on-chain. In the same way DeFi has taken the middleman out of finance Nuance does the same for the written word.

**Nuance Product**

Nuance is an entirely on-chain publishing platform. It applies the benefits of Web 3: Anonymity, self-sovereignty, censorship resistance, community governance & tokenization to a Medium-style content hosting platform.

Nuance is a consumer-facing dApp with no access to sensitive user data. All aspects of Nuance DAO will be open-sourced and publicly viewable.

**Funding Target**

We are targeting to raise 250,000 to 300,000 ICP. If the SNS swap succeeds, an allocation of 30% (30MM of the 100MM tokens) will be swapped raising approximately 1 to 1.2 MM USD. This provides us with ~18 months runway with our target burn rate. We have successfully delivered four (4) 25K Dfinity Developer grants which demonstrate we can deliver effectively on funds raised.

We are seeking 100,000 ICP from the Community Fund.

More details about the distribution and SNS configuration can be found in the [whitepaper](https://nuance.xyz/publication/nuance/white-paper) or the [SNS configuration](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10GsmzUxCh7ZX25WWatZTSIMpvP9s1TY0Cj8iS3YbxVc/edit?usp=sharing) or directly in the [initialisation file](https://github.com/Aikindapps/Nuance/blob/master/sns.yml). Or see the [SNS deck here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kpdicre5gzlx9r9br86q2/SNS-Deck.pdf?rlkey=zn4l2hp84bjchkovow0m0j53x&dl=0).

We are excited to launch our SNS and what lies ahead for Nuance and the IC!

Some highlights from the white paper SNS configuration for TLDR which we hope will get the discussion going:

* Min. of 50 ICP participation in swap üò≤
* Min. neuron size of 999 SNS tokens (ensure participants in the swap can participate in governance)
* 6000 SNS tokens reject cost (high because we want excellent quality proposals that already have community support prior to being proposed)
* 30% token allocation to the founding team and seed investors
* 30% token allocation to the swap
* 40% token allocation to the treasury
* 250K to 300K ICP min/max to provide 18 months runway (we dont want to take more because this would be speculative - we want genuine governance participants. We want Nuance to be the product, not the token)
* Treasury will airdrop tokens to readers to subsidise writers

Should be mandatory to post the name and roles of the whole team. You are asking for a valuation of 1Million$, a thorough due diligence should be provided.

here is the team https://twitter.com/nuancedapp/following - Me aka nosaac (product management), Paul (engineer/architect), Mitch (engineer), Baran (engineer), Eelco (design from Okapion) and Rhiannon (marketing). There is a little more about the team in the [SNS deck](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kpdicre5gzlx9r9br86q2/SNS-Deck.pdf?rlkey=zn4l2hp84bjchkovow0m0j53x&dl=0).

I see a common problem in the crypto world and it is that projects do not adhere to the same rules or disciplines when raising capital. 
Here the projects are usually limited to the ecosystem where they are born, when in the real world startups aspire to lead a global market. 

For example, would you be able to give us details of what you are going to do with the funds you raise? 
What‚Äôs you growth strategy? 
How much are you going to allocate to marketing and on what platforms? 
Are you going to use Google Ads? Meta? Are you going to allocate money to email marketing? 
Are you going to look for synergies like other crypto projects from other ecosystems?
How long is your runway with the capital raised according to the business plan? 
How many users do you expect to have after X amount of time? 
What are you going to do if you don't achieve the goal? 

In summary, I can think of 1000 questions that any start-up could answer if they aspire to raise thousands$ (not millions!!)  and yet here the projects are limited to presenting a simple white paper to raise millions. 
it does not make any sense.

This applies to every SNS until today, not just Nuance!!

lara | 2023-08-31 07:57:07 UTC | #10

Hi @nicko , 
I have two main questions:

> * Min. neuron size of 50 ICP (ensure participants in the swap can participate in governance)
> * 50 ICP reject cost (high because we want excellent quality proposals that already have community support prior to being proposed)

these are referring to SNS neurons, right? If so, these values would usually be given in the unit of the new SNS token. Do you mean here 50 SNS tokens or would this then translate to something else?

I also wanted to find the name and symbol of the new SNS token that will be created and didn't immediately find it. Maybe it would make sense to give a bit a high level summary of these most important settings here? They seem currently a bit hard to find among several posts.
It might also help to share the initialisation file that you will need to submit the NNS proposal here as this will contain all the settings that the SNS will be set up with (see the recommendation [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/sns-checklist#32-community-discussion)).

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-08-31 08:22:24 UTC | #11

Hi Nuance team, Many thanks for sharing the details of your planned SNS launch!

I had a quick look at the tokenomics sheet and noticed the following:

* The parameter *neuron_basket_interval*, which determines the interval of dissolve delays within an SNS neuron basket, is currently set to 0. I assume this is not intended (as this would create neuron baskets with zero voting power). I would advise setting this to a positive number (e.g., 6 months).
* The parameter *neuron_basket_count*, which determines the number of neurons within the SNS neuron basket, is currently set to 2. This implies that 50% of the neuron basket would have a stake of 0 and thus no voting power.

As an example to illustrate: If you increase the *neuron_basket_interval* to 6 months and the *neuron_basket_count* to 5, the voting power of the swap participants would be 56%, thereby decentralizing the DAO."

I hope this helps!

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-08-31 08:36:50 UTC | #12

Can I assume you mean www.nuance.com ? The AI healthcare company recently acquired by Microsoft? Our legal team have not raised this potential trademark infringement with us but I will get this double-checked. Thanks for your suggestion :pray:

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-08-31 08:49:20 UTC | #13

Thanks Bjoern for these points - we will check those out so they make sense. Will update you here when we have done so :pray:

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-08-31 09:09:17 UTC | #14

Thanks for your thorough questions.

In this part of the white paper https://nuance.xyz/nuance/3810-zjfrd-tqaaa-aaaaf-qakia-cai/funding-target I outline that the Aikin team (founding team) will make proposals in the order of 70% for product development, 20% for marketing and 10% for legal. I realise this is  high level, but as a DAO the community will decide this split. In that part of the white paper (and in the original post above) I specify this will provide as ~18 months runway.

Regarding the 70% of product development, I have outlined the product roadmap in this part of the white paper https://nuance.xyz/nuance/3808-zjfrd-tqaaa-aaaaf-qakia-cai/product-roadmap.

Regarding the 20% on marketing - we do not have a detailed plan yet (as we have been focusing primarily on getting to product market fit before we spend on marketing) but we will have two social media managers working linkedin, twitter, dscvr and distrikt. We also plan 5K per month on twitter/google search promotions.

For growth, we intend to use traditional growth hacking techniques to grow the user base. For example, we seem to have a handful of sci-fi writers using the platform so it would make sense to double down on this niche. At the moment one of our biggest challenges is SEO which will bring organic growth. We have invested a lot in SEO already and will continue to do so.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-08-31 12:29:46 UTC | #15

Thanks Lara for the advice - We have followed the checklist but seems not well enough :) 

Indeed the 50ICP min neuron size and reject cost should be in the SNS token unit (as it is in the SNS configuration sheet ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) which will be 5999 and 6000 SNS token units respectively. I will update the main post above.

I will add the name and symbol. Its not currently included in the documentation. Again my oversight. 

I have included a link to our SNS configuration file in the original post and will add a link to the initialisation file also.

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2023-08-31 19:03:39 UTC | #16

I think the community is being drained a bit with these SNS proposals, I never really comment on them but for the sake of the community checking this out I want to raise concerns I have for the first time.

You guys want to raise 1.2 million for 18 months runway correct? thats a burn rate of nearly 67k usd a month, which to me, is crazy for a small niche web3 dApp like nuance. So far you say you guys have had 4 dfinity grants (25k each) and that's over 2 years? I presume no or negligent seed investment, so my estimate, your burn rate so far has been 5k usd a month?

The numbers here don't make sense how can your burn rate increase 13x post SNS when you say 70% of the funds is going for product development? 

I'm thinking most of the SNS launches have just been a way to raise significant funds for the founding team and to use the community as exit liquidity, which I know is an extreme statement, but it's hard to see these things any other way.

Everyone needs to DYOR a little bit more and follow the money.

P.S. I think nuance is a cool product and have nothing against nuance or the team, just in general I am noticing a pattern.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-08-31 20:59:25 UTC | #18

Perception is reality. 
My hope with these SNS raises is that ICP is locked in 8-year neurons and the maturity is used to prop-up their SNS partners. The way I look at it is this is not the right time for Nuance to have an SNS... wait for ModClub (whom I believe does the Nuance dapp moderation) to stake their ICP from their raise and let it accumulate to help fund their SNS partner Nuance. Complete synergy. 
Idk... this is a favorite project of mine... I hope it succeeds but if you're expecting 18 month runway from the SNS - don't stake the ICP in a neuron (goes against everything I stand for) and just try to sell all the ICP at the top of the bull cycle and get a longer runway.
Edit: Maybe I missed the plans for the ICP in the whitepaper, what is the plans for raised ICP?

@nicko Congratulations on the work, I did not realize you had already delivered four $25K Developer Grants, that proves your track record, and explains the level of work that is evident in your app.

The SNS Route is logical, and I am almost certain you will be successful.

DAOs should always follow this route, build, show value, then when users and community know you, go for a fund raising DAO for expansion.

Hey Jesse! We have also raised 205K from seed investors and done about 50K worth of development work for 3rd parties in that time. I should also point out that myself and my co-founder have not taken anything out. Not one cent have we paid ourselves over the previous three years. I say ~18 months but with our target burn rate, it will be more like 21 months. Here is the breakdown I am thinking which will mean a 47K per month burn rate (please keep in mind these are rough numbers):

* 22 400 - engineering - two full-time developers (or equivalent) @ 70USD per hour x 320hrs per month
* 2 000 - design @ 100USD per hour x 20hrs per month
* 2 600 - community management @ 40USD per hour for senior and 25USD per hour for  junior x 40hrs each per month
* 5 000 - ads/promotions per month (google and twitter)
* 5 600 - product management @ 70USD per hour x 80hrs per month
* 5 600 - architect / tech lead @ 70USD per hour x 80hrs per month
* 1 600 - rent office per month
* 400 - software e.g. slack, gitbook per month
* 2000 - legal per month

**Total - 47 200 monthly burn**

* We want to have **18 months** runway. That leaves us 3 months (or ~140K) for inevitable unplanned expenses - or just more runway.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-01 07:59:42 UTC | #22

Hey! Thanks for the support. I think :slight_smile: 

Please see my response to Jesse - which outlines a little detail on the plans for the raised ICP. If you have any additional questions please reach out (of course). 

We plan to propose a quarterly roadmap to deliver on the goals - see some more in [this part of the white paper](https://nuance.xyz/nuance/3808-zjfrd-tqaaa-aaaaf-qakia-cai/product-roadmap). 

It's important to mention that it will be up to the community, of which we are a part, to decide what the team will actually be spending their time upon.

Thanks for your support! It's a very exciting time for us. This really is bleeding-edge tech and we are very proud of what we have built. Thanks to @paulk , @Mitch  and @barolukluk :man_bowing: - and of course our seed investors and the Dfinity foundation :pray: for making this possible.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-01 08:27:59 UTC | #26

We thought it worth sharing some points from the dfinity site: 

-------

What an SNS is NOT

**Not an ICO**
No funds are directly handed over to developers. The creation of an SNS is initiated by a decentralized entity (the NNS), and ICP raised by the decentralization swap is allocated to the treasury of the newly born SNS DAO. The founders receive a portion of the NNS DAO tokens in the form of locked neurons.

**Not an IPO**
This is not a liquidity exit or a public listing. It's the start of a new journey where you as the initial creator and your users have the opportunity to form a digital community, 100% on-chain, to co-evolve and grow the platform or application.

-------------------------

AbelOdoh | 2023-09-02 07:58:47 UTC | #27

Congratulations to you @nicko, and everyone at Nuance who has been hard at work for the past few years and the dedication and intense work towards finalizing the Nuance product in the past few months to make sure it achieves thorough development before it is handed over to the community for continued control and ownership.

I am happy to see Nuance finally inviting the community to take over control of this great product. Good luck to you all, and congratulations to all co-owners of Nuance shortly!

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-09-04 08:54:04 UTC | #28

Hi @nicko and team,

thanks a lot for preparing all the information. I read through your whitepaper and have a few questions on the [tokenomics](https://nuance.xyz/nuance/3811-zjfrd-tqaaa-aaaaf-qakia-cai/tokenomics).

In the first paragraph, you mention that
> 
> The Nuance token is a DAO governance token that allows token holders to vote on proposals to change the Nuance blogging platform and dispense funds held by the DAO treasury. It serves no other unique function.

but then you proceed with listing utility mechanisms like applauding and buying NFTs. 

In addition, I wonder how you handle the restrictions. Will my NUA account balance withing Nuance distinguish between airdroped (restricted) tokens and non-restricated tokens I bought? Am I understanding correctly, that restricted tokens also can't be used for staking? 

Finally, in the last paragraph, you write:

> In order to vote, a user must lock their tokens in an SNS neuron. The neuron allows a lockup of 60 days to two (2) years. Once locked, the neuron can vote via the SNS. Neurons accrue interest at a 5% annual rate. **The minimum neuron size is 5999 SNS tokens (~50 ICP)**. The cost of making a proposal that is not adopted will be 6000 SNS tokens (~50 ICP).

But in the [sns.yaml](https://github.com/Aikindapps/Nuance/blob/957f879db8e96ed6bfb59c4078e2bb662ec8deb8/sns.yml#L243), you specify a minimum of 999 SNS tokens.

Thank you for the update, @nicko! After a brief review of the updated init.yaml file, I've noticed some discrepancies when compared to the tokenomics spreadsheet. Could you please clarify the target parameters? These discrepancies are important because they would influence the voting power in the SNS.

* For the number of a neurons in the swap basket, the init.yaml file sets it to 5 months, whereas the tokenomics spreadsheet states 0.5 years.
* The dissolve delay for developer neurons is set at 2 years in the init.yaml file, compared to 1 month in the tokenomics spreadsheet.
* The dissolve delay bonus multiplier is set to 1 (100%) in the init.yaml file, while it's 2 in the tokenomics spreadsheet.

[/quote]

As we have not yet embarked on building the airdrop flow we do not yet have a detailed design, either UX or technical. This piece of work will be included in the first proposal we make post a successful SNS swap. 

You are correct that the current high-level design is that the restricted token cannot be used for staking. The restricted token will be merely a UI thing representing a token that can be gifted to a writer from the treasury. At least this is the MVP.

Of course, this is something we would "discover" during our user research in the design phase.

My apologies. We are updating the white paper, this topic, the yml and the sns config sheet based on feedback from this forum discussion.

As an writer who's had the privilege of using the Nuance platform and engaging with the team behind it, the announcement of transitioning into a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) feels like a natural evolution for a platform committed to transparency, community engagement, and the ideals of Web 3.0.

Nuance has continually positioned itself as more than just a publishing platform‚Äîit aims to be a hub where self-sovereignty and nuanced discussions are the norms rather than the exception. And given the complexity of our digital social fabric, the timing couldn't be more pertinent. As someone who has given feedback to the team on multiple occasions, I've noticed not just their receptivity, but also an unrelenting drive for refinement and innovation‚Äîsomething you'll have noticed from their attention to the comments already posted by the community. 

While the feedback and discussion continues, I hope readers take note of Nuance‚Äôs thoughtful, forward-thinking strategy ‚Äîone that aligns closely with a long-term vision. Their proven track record of delivering on DFINITY Developer grants should give additional confidence in the platform‚Äôs future capabilities.

In particular, their plan for treasury airdrops to subsidise writers is inspired. This mechanism, if implemented effectively, could be a groundbreaking way to incentivise quality writing and thoughtful readership‚Äîcreating a virtuous cycle that rewards meaningful interactions over clickbait.

I also appreciate the platform's commitment to privacy and data sovereignty, crucial aspects that most Web 2.0 platforms often neglect or sacrifice at the altar of profit. The idea of coupling this with tokenized elements like NFTs for article ownership opens up exciting new avenues for creators like me.

For the critics and the cautious, a DAO setup is not without its challenges, but my experience of Nuance to date is that they deliver.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-09-06 02:37:23 UTC | #37

This is super reasonable

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-09-06 02:46:29 UTC | #38

Reg. the utility of NUA
Its only unique function is as a governance token. The intention is to allow any Nuance white-listed currency - initially NUA & ICP, but soon others, to be used on the platform. The idea is to let the user choose whichever currency they want to use and not create unnecessary UX friction.

There will be a fee charged for tips and content (NFT) sales hypothetically, 10%. This will go back to the Nuance DAO treasury creating a diversified pool of assets. These can be controlled by the neuron holders. They could be used for development, marketing, or paid out to NUA neurons or token holders.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-09-06 02:52:43 UTC | #39

I would add to this that they have built a mature, high-value on-chain product. They have proven they can deliver and have a reasonable budget. They are professionals with years of IC experience who could have raised a lot more money earlier but waited for the SNS to cut in the community.

The airdrop scheme is also excellent - it gives a user with no experience the ability to play with the platform and both incentivises early writers and onboards them as stakeholders - It's how tokens are supposed to be used.

Following my earlier statement of support for Nuance's SNS, some thoughts regarding the SNS contribution minimum:

One should be mindful that monetary value is not globally consistent, by which I mean that $3.30 USD (today's rough ICP value) may not be much for someone on a Western salary, but it is a significant amount to many of our brothers and sisters around the world. I get the idea behind the minimum, ie to encourage contributors who will participate in DAO proposal voting, and there does seem very little point in having $3.30 USD worth of gov tokens spread across several neurons & locked for 365+ days, BUT... there are significant IC communities developing in Africa and South America, and (IMO) it is incumbent upon us to consider IF a 50 ICP minimum may exclude people in these, or similar regions.  I am sure this is due to the hard work of the global ICP HUBs. For example, both Nigeria and Argentina have average monthly wages equivalent to $750 USD, which 1/3 rd the average monthly salary in the UK (Googled it!). 

I understand that when the SNS goes live, we do not know what the ICP price will be, but am guessing neither the bear, nor the financial pressures we are all experiencing, will evaporate either!

One year's subscription to Medium is $5 USD per month, or $50 per year if paid in one go. In the above context, paying for a Medium year is equivalent to 6% of a Nigeria-Argentina monthly income (2% of a UK monthly income), and is equivalent to 15 ICP. Whereas 50 ICP is (roughly) equivalent to 22% of a Nigeria-Argentina monthly income... that's quite a hit!

As above, I get the intention is to encourage commitment from contributors, and I take no issue with this, but I do believe participation should be as global as possible. 

I will point people on Distrikt towards this post and flag it to IC Hubs too.

We deeply appreciate your ongoing support @NickM - in the darker times over the past few years, your enthusiasm has provided much-needed grit and your insight during user research has helped us truly understand what writers need (and build a better product) üí™.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-07 21:03:49 UTC | #47

Thanks again for the insight. We have reduced the minimum participation to 10 ICP. 

Based on the forum discussion so far we have reduced the min neuron stake to 999 Naunce tokens. Since we do not want participants in the swap who cannot subsequently participate in government we have reduced the minimum participation to 10 ICP - which is roughly 999 Nuance tokens. What do you think?

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-07 21:06:43 UTC | #48

Although the rejection cost may seem "high" - in fact this should be a fraction of what it costs to get a high-quality proposal. A high-quality proposal should be very thorough and already aligned with the community prior to being formally proposed.

-------------------------

NickM | 2023-09-08 07:51:02 UTC | #49

I think 10 ICP minimum contribution is a great choice, and the min neuron stake is inspired. It sets a great tone for meaningful participation.

-------------------------

NickM | 2023-09-08 08:24:42 UTC | #50

Couldn't agree with you more. Proposals should generate practical application & positive outcomes. As Nuance approaches SNS have already been thinking about what I may propose in the future, and the rejection fee has really focused the thinking, ie is it a selfish proposal, or one that will benefit all writers/readers. 

DAO creation is an invitation to participate, and as such should be viewed as a privilege... and a responsibility (IMO).

-------------------------

NickM | 2023-09-08 08:27:41 UTC | #51

What is the minimum number of contributors? 

This is a nascent space, and given the ability to accrue gov tokens post SNS, have you considered toggling the number of contributors to the minimum suggested?

[quote="Mitch, post:34, topic:22466"]
So my understanding is that 200% would be equal to 2?
[/quote]

Yes this is correct!
[/quote]

@Mitch Please hold on, I am not sure anymore if my statement is correct (my apologies). Let me confirm and get back to you.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-09-08 15:23:48 UTC | #53

@Mitch Just to confirm: My earlier feedback was indeed incorrect. The bonus numbers are interpreted as a relative increase (this changed compared to the prior set-up and hence the confusion). 

Example: For the dissolve delay bonus a value of "100%" means that the voting power will be doubled (multiplied by 2).

We are currently updating the ambiguous description in the sns_init.yaml file.

-------------------------

Mitch | 2023-09-08 15:54:51 UTC | #54

Thanks @bjoernek, I will change it back to 100% in our sns.yml!

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-09-08 16:33:54 UTC | #55

Thank you, and please make sure that also the age bonus is set according to your needs (same % convention applies there).

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-09 14:56:51 UTC | #56

Thanks for your feedback everybody! üôè

Thanks for your support. Big love. Let‚Äôs get this party started ü•≥

Proposal will be made September 13 üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To summarize the changes we've made:

- Min participation : 10 ICP - Based on feedback to lower participation cost to be more inclusive
- Min stake : 199 tokens  - To allow for reduced min participation 
- Vesting schedule neuron baskets (5) and intervals (5 months) - Based on feedback to ensure neuron basket had voting power
- Dev neuron dissolve delay (2 months) - Based on feedback to ensure voting power was decentralized.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-09 13:50:30 UTC | #57

We have structured our setup the following way:

Aikin B.V. is a Dutch-registered company. I live in the Netherlands. Our seed investors have invested  in Aikin B.V. via an [EPOS](https://www.capitalwaters.nl/blog/epos-easy-prepayment-on-shares-introduced-as-convertible-light-for-dutch-seed-financing-deals/) which is a convertible note, like a SAFE. 

If the swap is successful 30% of the tokens will be allocated to Aikin and vested over two years. 

A successful swap will also trigger the convertible note.

Post conversion the investors will collectively own 15% of Aikin B.V.

Hi @nicko,

Part of valuing a project is understanding that project‚Äôs current user base, growth, and activity over time. Are you able to provide:

1. Current user numbers and user numbers over time in terms of both anonymous and logged in users?
2. Measure of activity over time (i.e. posts created, views. likes, reshares etc.)?

Also, showcasing the mechanism used to pull these stats would be helpful (if built internally).

Thanks!

NickM | 2023-09-09 22:15:37 UTC | #59

Can't speak for the team, and I know this doesn't answer all your questions, but given its the weekend... some stats to consider in the meantime.

" The Nuance production team, *Aikin* , consists of product, design, engineering, and marketing professionals. Since launching the Nuance Alpha in August 2021, the team has delivered more than 20 releases, consisting of a multitude of new features. Since the alpha, 3,300 authors have posted more than 3,500 articles, readers have accessed articles 155,000 times, and they have tipped authors more than 62,000 ‚Äúapplause‚Äù. The base Nuance blogging product is live, stable, and feature-complete. It took 2 years, $300,000, and a lot of sweat. Further funding is needed for more advanced token features, marketing, and maintenance."

Gm!
1. How will friction be for ordinary web2 users that want to subscribe to my content on Nuance? Having to buy NFT's with ICP on some marketplace is imho not going to cut it. They need to be able to just click a button and pay for it. Ordinary users can't be bothered with NFT's, marketplaces, swaps etc.
2. Most of the next generation content platforms are extremely limited in customization. Will we be able to add own code to allow for eg advanced publications or will publishers be limited to the usual WYIWYG boxes with extremely limited features?

Love this question because our design philosophy is centred around providing as close-to-web2-experience as possible. The fact that Nuance is built on blockchain should be transparent to the user - as much as possible. You will notice we use "Login" rather than "connect wallet" for example. 

We have already implemented an NFT gated paywall (we have not yet designed the subscription flow but I will reach out when we do). Today in Nuance the user gets to the paywalled article, pays the fee for the NFT in one click, and then they can access the article. The user does not need to go to a marketplace. But they can only use ICP at this stage.

When a user purchases an NFT to access content via Nuance, the fact that it is an NFT is somewhat irrelevant. The user just wants to get past the paywall. But the benefit to the user is that once they have read the article, they can transfer that NFT to somebody else. Sell it. Give it to a friend. Whatever. 

In our first proposal, assuming a successful SNS swap, we will be improving the UX of the NFT purchase flow.

Of course, this is up to the community! One of our goals, which we hope the community supports, is to provide an unbelievably good user experience for the writing experience. So this suggestion is very much aligned and if the community supports it can be added to the backlog.

hey @justmythoughts - indeed these are important metrics.

Our own analytics we capture:
- article views (each article)
- total article views for a writer
- total article views (158048)
- registered users (3356)
- article applause (each article)
- total applause for a writer
- total applause (64748)
- total articles published (3603)

All of the above :point_up_2: is publicly available via the block explorer.

With usergeek we capture:
- Active users (DAO/WAU/MAU)
- New users
- Retention

We do not use other product analytics suites because they are not on chain. We are 100% on-chain. Because you're not hardcore unless you live hardcore :muscle:

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-11 20:25:00 UTC | #64

Analysing the other SNS swaps to date - they all had well over 100 participants contributing more than 10 ICP.

Nonetheless, we have reduced it to 50 just to be on the safe side.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-11 20:35:30 UTC | #65

Also, for those interested. We have our wiki here for self-service user guides https://wiki.nuance.xyz/nuance/

Hi Nuance team & all, 
Please check out the [SNS Init Analyzer](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-tokenomics-analyzer/22954), which you can use to review the Nuance SNS init file.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-12 15:05:14 UTC | #67

Using the SNS Analyzer, this is the result I got for Nuance Swap:

![image|690x339](upload://qtud53e3Y6k1hRIv0MN3cdOZXNu.png)

Looks like the devs will have decisive majority after the swap

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-09-12 15:13:43 UTC | #68

@vavram I tried it with the most recent sns [init](https://github.com/Aikindapps/Nuance/blob/master/sns.yml) from Nuance (using the link  posted at the beginning of this thread), and I obtained a different outcome (Voting power of dev= 47.1%) Could you double check which file you used ?

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-12 15:24:25 UTC | #69

Right, looks like it was an old version. Here's the current one:

![image|690x343](upload://1SRdilaZHKO95yO2EuSAL0vSpzO.png)

Regarding this @bjoernek, how can we check in the NNS proposal which version of the configuration will actually be deployed?

-------------------------

Mitch | 2023-09-12 15:34:01 UTC | #70

Hey @vavram, when we make our proposal you will be able to verify by inspecting the payload. Here is an example of how it will look: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124483

For the time being, as explained by @Mitch, you can compare the payload. 
With the next version of the SNS Tokenomics Analyzer, this comparison will be automated by the tool.

Antony | 2023-09-15 09:00:02 UTC | #72

Nuance Looks like a cool project to me: They have a working product and good team.

Only have one concern behind: It seems that the team is having 47% voting power with assumed 100% participation of CF& non CF, it will surpasses 60% with assumed 50% participation of CF & non CF 

@bjoernek Could you please comment on this.

Hope team will take a look into this @nicko .

Anyway all the best guys.

-------------------------

ivan_uncensored | 2023-09-15 06:20:31 UTC | #73

Overall Nuance is a good product. It should consider using ICRC NFT standard and need to get better UI for the dapp.

-------------------------

nicko | 2023-09-15 08:04:19 UTC | #74

Thanks @ivan_uncensored for the suggestion and feedback. We use one of the best design agencies in the Netherlands and without any bias whatsoever :stuck_out_tongue: I think our UI is beautiful.  Our design philosophy is obviously minimal, but also we want the user to not know/realise they are on web3. Can you be more specific about "better UI"? Perhaps you would be willing to have a call to discuss more deeply?

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-09-18 20:48:13 UTC | #75

It's just how it shakes out. No different to how it started with DFINITY. The important part is getting control in the hands of writers.
