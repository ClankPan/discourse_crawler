SNS1 is now 100% controlled by someone and it has lost most of its DAO properties. Of course, it is still logically possible to achieve token decentralization.

NNS and SNS are the main features of IC networks, and this event triggered some thoughts for me.

1. It is worth rethinking whether SNS governance is appropriate in the early stages of a project.
The project is in the early stage of relatively low market capitalization, it will be easy for someone to take 51% control. Many projects are in such a state in the early stage, and the final result depends on the project controller's philosophy and development path. When a project is strictly controlled by someone, does it make practical sense to achieve DAO governance on the surface? A project is more reasonable to realize DAO governance after achieving sustainable and stable operation, especially after the code is basically stable.

2. Does the concept of SNS governance of everything need to be restricted.
This is based on what the purpose of SNS governance is. If the SNS has all the power, then the more likely it is to fail, because there are more paths of governance attack. So it is worth exploring to let SNS have minimal governance authority. For example.
(1) Making the SNS a controller of the Dapp is only temporary and eventually requires it to give up control over the Dapp, it cannot escalate the wasm of the Dapp and only retains the ability to call certain specified methods on the Dapp at the business layer to implement certain specific governance functions.
Dapp developers need to be prepared to migrate uncontrolled canister when they encounter bugs, just as ethereum developers do.
In the end, we still need to pursue the perfect state of "code is law".
(2) Whether to allow SNS to change the established Dapp protocol rules, such as the economic model. For example, the current SNS1 can easily be increased.
The protocol rules of the Dapp have been agreed before the SNS starts, and the SNS is only the executor of the protocol rules. It is unreasonable that an executor can change the protocol rules. Therefore, to restrict the SNS to change the Dapp protocol rules, only allow it to change some specified protocol parameters.


3. The rules of the proposal voting "passed" need to be graded.
At present, the base for counting votes is the number of weights of  neurons with voting rights, the minimum voting rate is 3%, and the rate for "passing" the proposal is 50%. This is reasonable in many cases, but unreasonable in major matters (such as changes to the Dapp protocol), because in many cases someone holding 15% or even a lower percentage of token can control the outcome of the vote, such as the SNS1 event.
A reasonable approach is to grade the type of proposals, and major decisions at the Dapp protocol level require a higher total voting rate (e.g., 30%) and a higher "yes" vote rate (e.g., 70%), so as to maintain the stability of the Dapp protocol and increase the cost of 51% attacks.

4) Does SNS need to introduce a board of directors.
As in general corporate governance, not everything is decided by the general meeting of shareholders, and some unimportant daily matters can be decided by a vote of the board. This largely improves the professionalism and efficiency of decision making, especially in the early stages of project development.

1. I think the practicality really depends on a case by case basis. I think ideally, a complete dApp would be good. But, how does this prevent anything? They're still susceptible to the same attacks unless they launch with a large enough market cap to mitigate the attack and that's not really anything that can be controlled for in many cases imo.

> The protocol rules of the Dapp have been agreed before the SNS starts, and the SNS is only the executor of the protocol rules. It is unreasonable that an executor can change the protocol rules. Therefore, to restrict the SNS to change the Dapp protocol rules, only allow it to change some specified protocol parameters.

2. Is this not the case now? I thought the ledger, gov, root, and other core canisters are managed by the SNS-WASM/NNS. Are these able to be changed with `UpgradeSnsControlledCanister` on NNS launched SNSes as well?

3. Definitely agree. I think this might address a lot of the problems with #1. This is something I've had to point out to people multiple times. A lot of people seemed to have a misconception about how this actually works. It's the neuroned tokens that matter when it comes to voting. What isn't neuroned has no influence in voting power. Even if there are 2 billion coins, if only 100 are staked, only 51 are needed to take control of the DAO.

-------------------------

1. Most valid point, DAO should have most of the major functionalities and should achieve stable state before going under SNS. 
But Projects undergoing SNS right now are kinda raising funds for further development.

[/quote]

This is only the case because the majority of DAO members were actively selling their stake and no longer wanted to participate in the SNS1 DAO, right? If the majority of DAO members want out of the DAO, and one entity wants to buy them out, I don't see a problem with that. It's like a large corporation buying a smaller business that may be faltering, then injecting capital into it to bring it back to life.

Maybe they'll take it in a new direction, re-distribute the tokens so they no longer have a 51% stake. Use it as a launchpad infrastructure already in place to build something great?

I see a lot of talk about 51% attacks, but this was not that. It was someone who bought tokens that were openly available on the market from people who no longer wanted to participate in the SNS1 DAO. That doesn't mean it can't ever go back to a DAO, it has just been reset to what most "DAO"s start out as.

I think it does. It allows a lot of flexibility in the decision making. Just because I hold 51% stake in something and can override any vote, doesn't mean I don't want feedback from the community. And if I genuinely don't care what happens with a specific proposal, I can abstain and let the other participants decide.

[quote="bitbruce, post:1, topic:20683"]

I think this would really depend on the type of DAO/dapp/business you're running. In my opinion, there's certainly nothing wrong with some restrictions. But that would be up to the DAO/dapp/business founders. There's an infinite number of ways an SNS could be used in the overall infrastructure of an organization.

[/quote]

In my opinion, no matter how you weigh the votes or grade the proposals. If there are enough people selling their voting power, and someone has enough capital to buy it up, they can swing the vote however they want. Also, as someone said in another thread, a lot of deals like these won't happen on chain, they'll happen in offices across the world. "Hey Bob, I really want to push this vote through. Come spend a weekend in the Bahamas so we can talk about it. Bring the family!" Ha ha!

[quote="bitbruce, post:1, topic:20683"]

[/quote]
Just make sure your board of directors collectively hold 51% when the token mint happens. Of course, you have to somehow guarantee they aren't going to sell it.

I think you definitely bring up a lot of good things to consider for anyone seriously considering starting a DAO. There's a lot of nuances that go into governance, and I'm sure we haven't thought of most of them because it's still such a new space. I'm looking forward to watching what happens with SNS1. I'm not a holder of the token, but I'll definitely pick one up if the price is right.

Of course, this is part of the market behavior and can be interpreted as "not an attack". I think this state is not the goal of SNS. In fact, the controller of SNS1 can do anything now, he can upgrade the wasm of all the cansiter in the dapp, including the SNS1 token, for example, to increase the total supply of SNS1. He doesn't have to operate through SNS, SNS is just a form for him.

Just like a listed company in the stock market, a company that reaches a certain level of control will be required to launch a tender offer or delisting to all shareholders. The stock exchange is pursuing the goal of a "public company market," and the SNS is pursuing the goal of a DAO, not a DAO controlled by one person. I am not denying a one-person-controlled project, but rather expressing the view that the DAO pursued by the SNS should not be easily controlled by one person, or at least should raise the economic threshold. 
In blockchain, using economic costs solves most of the problems.

**Correction** : The wasm of SNS1 Ledger is provided by the SNS system, and the controller of Dapp can only choose to upgrade. He can modify Dapp’s canisters code (not including Ledger)

It's just testament to the IC how flexible this system is.

We (Dragginz) were considering a SNS launch, but it was the first time we saw the whole "blank slate" concept on the SNS-1 landing page... just too tempting.  The issue with the SNS sale was that this was always going to be a project that was going to be centralised as far as creative control goes, and we felt we were just adding governance for the sake of it.  The facade of decentralised control didn't really align with the ethos of the IC.

That said, we are going to have rewards for neuron holders, maybe even give them a part to play in the game - create or breed Dragginz that nobody else can.  Honestly, fusing game balance with token ownership seems like it'll take a while to accomplish.

Bear with us, lots more information will be coming next week!

I think (hope) that was the last opportunity to buy your way into a SNS sale.  I believe that the NNS vote would have passed.  Yes this is jumping the gun a little, but crypto was getting really boring and I wanted to spice it up... BAM!

Sorry you have to redo your presentation.

What happens to the locked neurons that don't want to participate anymore? Are they stuck in SNS-1 purgatory.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-06-14 09:38:57 UTC | #13

Good question. I guess I could buy them out or something, or perhaps there's a SNS governance way to sort it.

I get that not everybody is as excited as I am about a fantasy world with dragons in.  The SNS was always going to become 'something' though and I can think of far worse outcomes.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-06-14 09:42:42 UTC | #14

Oh for sure. I am not against this buyout, just wondering if it was indeed malicious can't they just drain the other neurons out similar to the treasury. At the same time that would completely change the liquidity at the exchange. I don't see anything wrong with this but there are some questions we need to ask now like if these canisters held user data, a backup mech would be great to fork to another cluster of canisters if the community disagrees with leadership. Thinking about apps like Distrikt and others.

chepreghy | 2023-06-14 11:22:40 UTC | #17

Not at all. But @borovan played by the rules. No serious SNS project will set up a DAO, so that someone can buy it so easily. SNS-1 was meant as a dress rehearsal for the decentralization process, and to reveal what needs ironing out before real teams assign control of their dapp to an SNS. SNS-1 served its purpose, and it looks like, it will have an interesting future, be it not one initially envisioned.

lara | 2023-06-14 12:13:10 UTC | #19

Thanks for tagging me! 

Indeed, the SNS DAO can only upgrade the SNS canisters to WASMs that have been pre-approved by the NNS but can upgrade the dapp canisters to any WASM.
This is explained in more detail [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/lifecycle-sns/sns-architecture#sns-as-a-system-functionality-connection-to-the-nns-community).

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-06-14 12:42:57 UTC | #20

I mean worse case scenario is NNS take over right. I think there are bigger problems on the IC and crypto than a buyout takeover. It was a very predictable outcome. Hence why we open source and build data bridges into users personal canisters. As long as the NNS isn't taken over, canisters can move into other canisters data and value.

I agree the state it is in right now was probably not the goal of the original members. But it's possible the state will change in the future. Looking at it from a governance standpoint, in my opinion, it's no different than Dfinity having a voting majority on certain proposals so they can make sure the ICP network changes they submit get passed.

Sounds to me like @borovan is going to retain the 51% control so the game creator has the ultimate say over the creative course of the game, but will give out rewards and allow the community to provide feedback on certain aspects through voting? It may not have been the original intention, but the majority of people with original stake in SNS1 didn't care what happened with it anyway, evidenced by the sale.

I personally don't think it will be the last if you're thinking very long term. The more SNSs that launch, there are bound to be a few that start to die on the vine and have more than 50% of their tokens listed on an exchange. As you've proven, all it takes is someone with enough capital to buy it up. Nothing wrong with that in my opinion, just part of the ebb and flow of business. The more the technology behind the SNS advances, the more use cases we'll see. I think it's exciting. :man_shrugging:

-------------------------

chepreghy | 2023-06-14 15:20:01 UTC | #22

If DFINITY had actively tried to prevent this from happening, wouldn't that have been a less desirable outcome? We stated from the very beginning, that this is the ICP community's DAO, and you should do whatever you want with it. The community willingly sold their SNS-1 tokens to @borovan. What should have DFINITY done? DFINITY didn't aid, nor prevent what willing participants of the DAO did.

Isn't this a GOOD thing for a presentation on the ICP ecosystem? If it was me, I would say something along the lines of, the original idea of the SNS1 was launched with (insert lots of advanced features). Over time, the original members decided they wanted to exit the DAO and put their stake on the market for sale for various reason. Instead of leaving the SNS1 stagnant, a gaming company with enough capital purchased over 50% of the stake, and is going to use the SNS1 as part of their infrastructure. While this was not the original intent, the ICP and SNS technology allowed the market to regulate itself and  can open doors for companies and individuals to use it in ways we haven't even thought of yet. The information on the dashboard is in a state of flux due to the recent sale and will hopefully change to updated the current state of Draggin Karma Points.

I'm just throwing it out there that (as a new person to the ecosystem) I look at it as a GOOD thing and am happy it is all working as it should.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2023-06-14 15:25:31 UTC | #24

I think many people are accepting the outcome of this development. We can observe it. Then improve the SNS system.

Look at this thing objectively, no need to boycott it or sing its praises. It does reveal a lot of problems, and this is where SNS needs to be improved.

-------------------------

chepreghy | 2023-06-14 15:28:40 UTC | #25

Agreed. If anything, future teams planning to propose their dapp to be assigned to an SNS will design their initial tokenomics and token distribution very carefully, so a takeover is harder to execute. Needless to say, we welcome any suggestions for improving the design of SNS itself.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2023-06-15 00:40:28 UTC | #26

One very practical dilemma is this:
An SNS that is 100% controlled by one person who can modify any code and rules in the dapp. This would break the basic idea of the blockchain and would be a failure of the SNS if this became the typical use case of the SNS. 
Instead, there is room for technical improvements to limit the SNS to control everything.

chepreghy | 2023-06-14 19:21:54 UTC | #30

The application is still controlled by SNS-1, but SNS-1 cannot create transactions to transfer tokens from people's wallets, only from the treasury.

It does however have the power to mint tokens or change tokenomics in any way compatible with the SNS. This included adding voting rewards, changing minimum and maximum locking period, or changing the TX fee.

You're wrong. The core canister upgrades are dictated by the NNS/SNS-W since it was launched on the SNS subnet and not the standard application subnet. Governance, ledger, root, swap, etc. Only the dapp canisters can be modified.

Before doing an SNS, teams work with Dfinity and many others to make sure to prevent 51% attacks. The tokenomics are reviewed rigorously. The Neuron fund also helps with this. In spite these measures, it is very unlikely, but possible in time that a person could buy all of the tokens.

Total IMO: The first year of ICP was a lot about NFT. The second year a lot about BTC integration. Maybe games are the place to focus now: we will only know with time! 🐉🐉🐉🐉

During Supernova the two finalists were Cubetopia and Spnr. In many ways 'deep tech' (ZKP) / and mass adoption tech (games).

I don't think it's unlikely at all over a long enough time period. As the tech gets easier to understand and more projects launch, it's guaranteed that some of them will start to fail. Once more people start selling their stake, they'll be ripe for the picking for anyone with enough capital to buy up over 50%. IMO.

I agree with you 100% here. It could become a normal thing like how businesses purchase other businesses now. Just depends if a person or business finds it valuable enough to do so, like in this case for Dragginz.

I think it's just shocking for people to see here because there's either some emotional attachment to SNS1 getting in the way or a philosophical difference/misunderstanding. There were no rules broken here. No one has particularly been harmed that I know of. 

I know myself and some others expected something like this to happen with SNS1 at some point. Played out a little bit differently in my head 🤣 but same idea.

There is def room for improvement on how teams initialize the initial set params of the SNS. Future version can have an option to be more strict to prevent this similar outcome as something the founding team doesn't want for their app.

This reminded me of some interesting incidents

# coming from the original text of this article：
“ ****51% Attacks on Governance****

A key security concern is the prevention of an attacker gaining 51 percent of the voting power, or even just enough that they can tip the balance in favor of those who vote unwisely, which will damage the success of the network. (The term “attacker” here applies equally to an actor who wishes to harm the network, an actor whose influence will be malign by accident, and one that might simply excessively centralize power.) Luckily, all things being equal, the colossal value of ICP locked inside the NNS makes it exorbitantly expensive to acquire such a stake. Furthermore, the financial investment required would be difficult to recoup, since ICP that have been purchased and locked would dramatically lose value if the network were harmed. Even if resources were less of a concern — for example, where an attacker was a malign state actor — unlocked ICP could not be purchased quickly on financial exchanges, since the vast majority of the overall ICP supply is locked in neurons to earn rewards. This would force such an attacker to build up their position slowly over time, with the buy pressure created by significant purchasing also driving up the price, such that successive purchases become ever more expensive.

For these reasons, it is not likely to be possible to accumulate 51 percent of the voting power without gaining access to locked ICP balances. This reflects why it is important that markets cannot be created for neurons. In this case, an attacker might seek to create a market panic in order that they can quickly acquire locked stakes en masse at low cost. For example, they might combine a serious and sustained DoS attack on the network with the widespread dissemination of fake news and negative opinion on social media, to convince neuron owners that their locked stakes are at risk of becoming worthless such that a grand “fire sale” occurs. Although it is highly unlikely that a state actor would conduct such an attack in practice, the politics of open networks and digital assets ensure that mass manias and market crashes are far more possible. It is not in the interests of the network that such an event drives reorganization of voting power, especially where that results in its sudden centralization within a few well-financed hands. This further reflects why markets for neurons would be undesirable.”

# In the beginning, the majority of sns1 was also locked in SNS. The following are the reasons why borovan was able to obtain more than 51% of the votes in any DAO:

1. The sns1 holders were not optimistic about the future of sns1. They unlocked most of the tokens and sold them to borovan.
2. The sns1 DAO did not have a tested governance system. The proposals passed by the sns1 DAO did not have a standard process to accomplish. For instance, accomplishing projects like the Bitcoin stablecoin, sns1 wallet, bounty system, etc. were challenging. Also, sns1 had no profitability, and most sns1 holders were not very interested in governance. People who owned neurons were dissolving them, token holders were waiting for the right price to sell, and only a small minority were actively locking.
3. Due to points 1 and 2, the total voting weight of the sns1 DAO was only around 2000 for a long time. This already included the result of borovan's 250 sns1 locked for 100 years.
4. Locking for 100 years and giving twice the voting weight is unreasonable. Without any profitability and with difficult DAO governance, locking for 100 years is no different from destruction. This discouraged many people, but it provided an opportunity for a 51% attack/takeover. This means under the condition that the total voting weight of the sns1 DAO is only around 2000, an attack/takeover can be completed with just 1000 sns1 tokens. In reality, you may not even need that many, as the voting participation is only 40%.

Overall, I believe this is a relatively good outcome for a test DAO that already has a very poor governance system.

I dunno.  I might sit quietly and see what kind of a ride this is going to be. :slight_smile: Strapped in, whisky glass to hand... (not really a popcorn fan).

If you can call "Buying into" a poorly setup DAO with 100 years dissolve delay and rewards rate Disabled with only 9998 tokens instead of creating a normal one that actually could be used for "The game" than yes it is good.

Once again I apologise on behalf of the Dragginz Team about the fact you had to redo some of the charts from the second half of your presentation.

Much appreciated but no need. Everybody at the meetup agreed. Bridge, water under it and all that. When the video will be edited I'll send you a link.

I can't see a future for such a DAO, and DFINITY is not very interested in it. The so-called "on-chain governance" of the current IC is just exercising power on the chain. No one knows how a decision is made. The DAO itself is inefficient, does not recognize each other, has difficulty communicating, and it's even hard to verify how much voting weight the other party has. This kind of governance is not more advanced than the governance of traditional companies, political parties, and national governments. (Well, it's actually worse.) Compared with this, acquisition is already a good result, rather than using the advantage of initial token allocation to get absolute say (and then pretend to be decentralized).

@bitbruce and IC folks on this thread, it was quite an unusual event what happened, but I think we can see one positive thing, and also an eureka moment few saw before.

POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT
SNS-1 was successful before, yes it had issues, but it worked, the people who held the SNS-1 did put their stake for sale. Why wouldn't they? The SNS-1 was building nothing, and was for the most part dormant. Selling seemed like a good thing, and it did happen. A different project: Dragginz had some use for it, and I am sure @borovan and his team justified the investment. They can use it for their game in the future.

EUREKA MOMENT
The current SNS voting process, meaning to get to have a DAO in the IC is very strict, it's hard to achieve without significant financial backing, and some influence to make it work.  The IC would benefit from a much simpler process like minting a Token themselves with no votes from anyone, they just do it and it's up to the people to buy it or not, this Token Capitalization is very simple, anyone can do it, and that is why meme coins continue to appear, but also serious projects like Brave's Basic Attention Token.

I hope this does happen in the short term, that way there will be two paths, one for well established projects, with good financials who can go the SNS route, and another much simpler way, by simply minting a token and allowing people to buy it or not.

My two cents, and as I said overall, this was positive, but I hope the Eureka moment idea also happens and that simple token mechanisms are developed and blossom too.

Wow DFINITY’s state of the art proof of stake security is amazing! I am glad that after years of R & D, we have a state of the art SNS feature with fail-safe on-chain governance DAO voting. Congratulations to everyone involved.


To DFINITY and Beyond!

There is a story in the Bible; first Kings chapter 3 verses 16 to 28. In the story, King Solomon is presented with a dilemma; two mothers are fighting for a baby. The first woman willing for the baby to be cut into two disregarded the baby’s well being. The true mother willing to compromise to save the baby’s life offered the baby to her rival. King Solomon who had been blessed with wisdom, ordered the baby to be given to the mother that showed selfless love. 

Numerous questions arise on the current state of SNS-1; Among them are: 
1. What is the investors real goal that has majority stake? Not much has been communicated about the trajectory of the project. 
2. How much resources did it take to buy out all the early investors in SNS-1? What can future developers do to deter such an outcome. 
3. What was the investors initial intent and drive to acquire 51+% of voting power? 
4. Was the investors goal to make the community aware of design flaws of the SNS-1 and spark a debate about decentralization uncertainty? 
5. Do they have a vision of decentralizing the project in the future or are they seizing the SNS-1 to be their personal trophy? 
If the investor goal is to build a game, is the game planning to issue tokens for sale? 
6. What requirements would need to be met to decentralize voting power in the game? 
7. What regulatory issues would arise as SNS takes this direction? 
8. Who would be responsible if anything goes wrong? 

Looking ahead, I believe we will see the evolution of future SNS projects being fully decentralized. The situation that SNS-1 was put through only enlightens developers on the market uncertainties. Developers can now gain deeper understanding on the nature of markets and as such, adjust their strategies to develop fully autonomous uncompromised projects. The flaws that are being realized are only paving way to a more conductive environment for upcoming projects tokenomics.
