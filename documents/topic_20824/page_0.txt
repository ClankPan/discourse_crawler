I get this error while trying to follow a neuron via dfx.
Any idea?

`FIX ME! opt table2 <: opt Command_1 via special opt rule.
This means the sender and receiver type has diverged, and can cause data loss.
(record { command = null })`


`dfx canister --network ic call sns_governance manage_neuron \
 "(record { \
  subaccount = blob \"CANISTER_ID\"; \
  command = opt variant { \
   Follow = record { \
    function_id = 0; \
    followees = vec { \
     record { id = blob \"FOLLOWEE_CANISTER_ID\"} \
    } \
   } \
  }\
 })"`

Hi @apotheosis, 

most likely, you are using a version of DFX that is not compatible with the SNS you are working with.

Could you post what `dfx --version` prints, please, and what SNS are you working with?

It seems to be an old DID file. We found the new one here.
DFX 0.14.0
