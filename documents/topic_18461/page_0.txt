Looking for feedback/comments/outright rejections:

https://github.com/skilesare/ICRC-1/blob/Icrc4/standards/ICRC-4/readme.md

Use case:  We need to send multiple transactions when an Origyn NFT sells.  This can take a while.  Having a batch transfer will help reduce latency and improve the atomicity of payments.

I'd assume ICRC5 after this would be batch approvals and transferFroms to complement ICRC2.
