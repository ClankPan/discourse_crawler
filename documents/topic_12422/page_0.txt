Over the next couple of days I will set up and stake my ICP and would like some feedback on the process and options.

Today I will get my Yubico YubiKey and believe my first step is to setup a anchor then through https://identity.ic0.app/#authorize then go through the process of staking my coins.

The question for me is that as from the documentation on the length of time I should select 8 years for the best return and all the ICP that I am rewarded over time can be withdrawn at any time to cash or create a new neuron.

Any other advice would be useful thank you

P.S I will be voting and not just following.

Had problems setting up an anchor on my desktop so I decided to get a Yubikey and try once again. In Google I had the same problems with the key but in Edge I was able to create the anchor first time.

So I am login to the NNS and on the ICP tab it shows my account with zero ICP and tried to send some ICP from my coin account with their confirmation. 

When I tried this with Plug the coins show up within seconds.

Coin: ICP
Amount: 0.001
Fee: 0.0002
Total: 0.0012
Address: a28a89 ...

The address in my confirmation email is the same as the NNS account icp address but the next day there is zero icp in my account.

I was disappointed with Google constantly interfering with the process and not being able to connect with the NNS and then I find my late model oppo phone does not support NFC so I now need a usb-c to kubi adapter.

I will check my NNS icp account tomorrow  and see if the main account shows any amount. 

Could some one point out any mistakes I have made, thank you.

Well thanks for all the help as usual not that much but I relise that the amount sent has to be greater for the third digit to show.
