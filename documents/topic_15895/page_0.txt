Welcome to the Origyn NFT

TLDR:  https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft

Today, I’d like to share the culmination of many months of building and laser focus here at ORIGYN. This is a major milestone on our journey to implement a multi-year vision to protect authenticity and appropriately reward human creativity and ingenuity.

In brief, we’ve determined that we need a next-generation NFT that scales far beyond what is possible in the original Ethereum-based concept. The power and scalability of the IC have provided the tech we need to bring a more powerful, flexible and robust NFT to the market.

Over the next few weeks, we will release the first iteration of this new tech to the IC community for review, debate, improvement and coordination. What we present will be a living, breathing creation of our own. It will grow and improve over time as we discuss the merits and qualities we expect from the ORIGYN NFT.

We started with the release of the [perpetualOS white paper](https://www.origyn.com/whitepapers). This white paper lays the necessity for the vision and planned features for a new way to interact with NFTs. As with the code, this white paper has been many months in the making/writing, with the collaboration of the other leaders of ORIGYN Foundation. I’m thrilled it’s now live, and we welcome your eyes and discernment.

The executable, audited, open-source code is ready for you to experiment with. https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft. We hope that the release of this code and information will be seen as the collaborative effort that it is. We know how philosophical the Web3 community can be when it comes to new tech and, especially, something as bold as a “new standard.”

We do not take this effort lightly and feel this new standard is necessary for ORIGYN to achieve our vision and fully realize the mission of our foundation. We invite you to participate and will, of course, listen to any input you have, but we also offer the opportunity to put skin-in-the-game with OGY utility token. OGY token holders will ultimately drive our tech and platform and benefit from the tech we build together.

Thank you all. Welcome to the ORIGYN NFT.

Release notes:

We have a number of libraries that are being open-sourced today:

The origyn NFT: https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft - this is a motoko implementation of our origyn_nft standard.  This is an 0.1.0 release and we have a number of features to add in the future, but most of the basics are there.  There is also an alpha sales canister that helps with things like creating allow lists, running a 'drop', and taking pre-orders for the drop.  You can get the .did file for the nft and the sales canister by building this project.  We hope to have a rust implementation soon.

The Dapps:  https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/dapps - these are the "base dapps" for the perpetualOS that sits at the heart of each NFT.  They are all very, very alpha you can play with them at:

https://prptl.io/-/bmdev/collection/-/marketplace (select "All NFTs")
https://prptl.io/-/bmdev/-/bm-1/-/wallet
https://prptl.io/-/bmdev/-/bm-1/-/ledger
https://prptl.io/-/bmdev/-/bm-1/-/data
https://prptl.io/-/bmdev/-/bm-1/-/dapp_library

The ICx Proxy - https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/icx-proxy - This is our fork of the ICx proxy that does some magic that handles prptl.io.  Almost all functions are available if you just want to go directly to the canister, but this creates a common interface for accessing the ecosystem.  There are obvious security issues to deal with here as we start deploying third-party apps, but we are confident that tools like NFID and the authenticating infrastructure that @infu has been working on will provide a solution here that helps maintain user anonymity across the ecosystem even while using a single domain.

The minting Starter - https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/minting-starter - this is a template project that will help you easily mint an nft collection.  A more primitive mint example is available in the nft project itself, but this will become a more robust template as time goes forward that should make it easy and extensible to set up a collection and mint it.

CSM.js - Configure, Stage, Mint - the core js library that runs the minting starter. Use this if you want to build your own tool. More enhancements coming soon.

Phone_book -  https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/phone_book - a very simple look-up canister used by the icx proxy to create shortcodes.  This will be enhanced and merged with OGY governance in the future.

Other notes:

You'll find some opinionated stuff here.  Very little is written in stone at this point, but it is worth noting that the Origyn Foundation has a clear directive to preserve human ingenuity and to protect the rights of creators.  As a result, our marketplace works a bit differently than the rest of web three.  We have a bunch of ideas about how to smooth this process out in future releases.  You can find release notes here: https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft/blob/main/docs/release_notes.md. and the current API here: https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft/blob/main/docs/nft-current-api.md

Audit Notes:  The nft canister has been audited by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).  We've received the initial audit report and addressed all concerns raised in the audit. We are awaiting a final analysis of our mitigations.  The index of those can be found at https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/origyn_nft/blob/main/docs/audit.md 

Final notes:

We take pull requests.

This is awesome. I can't wait to see what consumer facing products that come out of it all.
