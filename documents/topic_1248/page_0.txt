I have a arm64  linux device and would like to use it with dfinity the dfinity sdk.
It looks like the sdk (dfx) and vessel are compiled for amd64 on linux.

Are there any detailed instructions on how to compile these two from the source on github.com.

I regret I am not that familiar with rust or even C so I would appreciate detailed steps.

Thank you,

While you could compile vessel for `arm` you still wouldn't have a Motoko compiler or the replica and those have more complicated toolchains and build processes, so for now I'd say it's not possible.
