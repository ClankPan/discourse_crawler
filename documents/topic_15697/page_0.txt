Hey ICP fam – Imagine checking in.

As I’m sure many of you *In-Tune* ICP folks are aware, there have been several discussions recently about the inflation of our protocol. Specifically referring to comments @chepreghy & @Kyle_Langham had regarding the most recent episode of the neurotic podcast.

I’m surmising here from personal judgement, but essentially, the premise is something of the sorts:

* “Rewards should be limited by X amount until the IC reaches profitability”
* “Rewards should be limited unless they are directly, or indirectly, contributing to the growth of the network.”

I must admit, my initial thoughts on this made me infuriated. After thinking about it for some time, I decided to just look at the data the Dashboard already hosts. Let’s make this black and white folks:

Circulating supply of ICP as of 5/11/2021 - 123,103,469
Total supply of ICP as of 9/29/2022 – 469,213,683

Circulating supply of ICP as of 9/29/2022 – 262,243,167
Total Supply of ICP as of 9/29/2022 – 489,975,184

Staked dissolving as of 11/6/2021 – 121,235,398
Staked dissolving as of 9/29/2022 – 86,307,380

Circulating supply increase: 113% (Horrible)
Total Supply Increase: 4.42% (Very solid honestly)
Staked dissolving neurons: -28.56% (Very, very solid)

Using the simple math above, one could reasonably assume the tokens are becoming sufficiently distributed amongst holders. Staked dissolving quantities have been trending downwards, and Total Supply is barely moving upwards *in proportion* to the rapidly growing circulating supply. However, over this time, the price of the underlying token has taken a nosedive. This leads me to believe supply is simply outpacing the demand for the token. And thus, we can reason a few things:

     - How can we reduce the supply?
     - How can we increase the demand?

I believe the latter is self-explanatory – System adoption, Robust applications *people are using*, novel features that drive adoption, marketing efforts, etc. Fairly straightforward – and which I believe the Foundation and Developers are overwhelmingly doing an outstanding job (Maybe excluding marketing lol. But been MUCH better as of recent)

Arguably more important for the *short to midterm* - **How can we reduce the supply such that the inflationary mechanisms are more muted?** Some half-baked thoughts:

* For Neurons who have had *zero system activity* since genesis, do not provide rewards. A proportion of rewards should be burned, and perhaps a proportion of rewards should go into the Treasury. (There are clearly a million more questions that arise from this, but just fancy the thought for a moment in respect to the supply situation)
  * Please note – when I say *zero system activity* I’m directly referring to those who have had staked neurons since genesis, have not logged on, have not actively/passively voted, have not staked, have not raked, etc. They’ve quite literally done nothing.
* Consider linear reduction in the inflation rewards, EXCLUDING 5-6-7-8 year neurons. (As a means to incentivize those to stake *longer*. One can assume this supply will *always be locked* and is essentially eliminated from the supply forever. Yes, I realize the protocol is “Mutable” – just consider for a moment)
  * I believe those who stake LESS time should be rewarded, but why does my 6-month neuron get 10% when my 8 year gets 20%? Seems totally ridiculous. This should be a MUCH more extreme difference. If I was a LARGE genesis holder (Disclaimer, I’m not lol. Not even genesis) I would just front run everybody in a 6-month stake for 10%. *I literally have a percentage of my holdings in a 6-month neuron for this very reason*! If price appreciation DOES occur, I would just dump at the highs. You understand the dilemma? REDUCE them (Me!) to an even smaller proportion. They can either dump it down here, hold it and eat the passive inflation effects, or stake it into a longer neuron.
* Increase transaction costs from .0001 to .001
* Rewards are a direct proportion of a moving average of burn rate (Excellent idea by @Mancopter / @varon1980 on Twitter! )

These are just some half-baked ideas. Rather, *I hope to encourage* the community to come and join in on some *civil discourse.* (Whoever, you are on that Subreddit, well done… :smirk: ) It is unfair for me to verbally attack those who have taken it upon themselves to propose a mere question. Some of the responses to Kyle and Andrew are just nauseating. Think of the *time* both have poured into making this community, and the ICP great. You mock them for making one claim you disagree with? Heck, I personally disagree with them both. But shame on us for ostracizing them with half ***** strawman arguments. The other half just tries to strong arm the discussion with their so called Insightful [antics] replies. Their motive *was clearly* to force the community into discourse on this subject …Smell the roses people, our community is lacking somebody in a leadership capacity right now. Food for thought…

Much love ICP Fam.

To fix a problem, first you need to know exactly what is the problem.  To me, the actual rewards system is not the problem. Here is why:
First, the pressure for down price does not come from paying rewards but from selling ICP.  So the sellors are the problem, not the receivers of the rewards.
There was 43m ICP given as rewards through maturity
Only 18m has been converted to ICP.
From what I can read, the vast majority are merging their rewards.  Let say 75% but would be nice to have the exact amount.  Some of these may use those ICPs for buying NFTs, ect.  So my rough figure is that there is only few millions that may contribute to the pressure.  Under 2% of the actual inflation.

On the other end, there are nearly 90-100 millions coming on circulation within the next 2 years.   They are in neurons locked in 2 years or less.  Most are certainly part of the seed investors unlocking schedule. There is nothing anybody can do about this and this is why another 100m will come on the market within 2 years.  It has nothing to do with the rewards system.

@Kyle_Langham is the specialist on these data and he know this fact very well.  He can certainly bring some precision to my numbers here. With all the respect for Kyle, I think this is why a lot of people were really surprised that had this taught about zerowing the rewards for a while and had those reactions.  

First, find the problem with strong proof.  Then look for a solution. The real proplem has not been found yet.  Well, to me it is those 100m unlocking seed ICPs. 

We cannot always make changes on assumptions only.  It would do the same as it did with NNS spams.

Why owners of those 100m ICP are getting their neurons to be unlock during the next 2 years?  Well, good chances are to sell them.  Only 1 possibe solution then:  Change their unlocking schedule and make it over 10 years.  Problem solved TMO.

Under my narrative, stopping the rewards system would not solve anything. 

Does this make sense?

Hello @coteclaude 

Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I agree with many points you have proposed. In fact – think we are heading in the same direction of thought. I *believe* I’m understanding your thoughts around this issue – but please don’t hesitate to correct me where I’m wrong.

Your basic premise boils down to something of the sorts – “The real problem is the swaths of supply that continue to be unlocked and are continuing to unlock over the following year/two.” During the token’s inception, circulating supply outpacing demand has led to token destruction of nearly 99%. From Nov 21’ – present, there have been ~30 million ICP dissolved off the NNS. There are now ~90 million tokens remaining to be dissolved off the NNS. Do you think our token can sustain another 90 million tokens dissolving? I’m not sure to be honest – but I'm not in the game of gambling.

And from this context – we mutually agree on the problem. The supply of the of circulating tokens is far outpacing the demand of tokens. Quite simple, doesn’t need to be complicated. Had demand for our token been keeping up with supply – we can posit price action wouldn’t have plunged.

I'm 100% NOT in favor of hurting Genesis holders who have dedicated their funding to see this project succeed. It is they who took the most financial risk, and it is they who deserve the most outsized reward. Destruction of this system to their disadvantage would destroy the fabric of what it means to work in a Governance DAO environment. All attempts to hurt Genesis holders will render future investment into DAO's futile. (This would be TERRIBLE for our entire space.)

I’m most definitely NOT in favor of stopping the rewards.  I’m suggesting a *primary driver* of tokens dissolving off the NNS/Large proportion sitting in 0month – 3yr neurons is because we have designed a poor rewards system. Why is that? I believe its because I can get a large amount of rewards for a 6 month stake ~10% in relation to an 8 Yr neuron pulling in ~20%. I'm not suggesting hurting anybody who has staked for 8 years. I'm suggesting a reduction in rewards for those not vested in the system for the long run. (Maybe 6 month - 2/3 years?)

We should try to navigate, “***How*** can we incentivize those who are dissolving to stay locked in, and for longer terms?” I tried to reason a primary driver of this issue was the fact *low age neurons get too large a piece of the pie in respect to their older companions.* Thus, reduction of the front end part of the rewards curve (Not the latter end) *may* result in those dissolving tokens re-staking into longer term pools. This may alleviate some of the pressure from tokens dissolving.

P.S - I've attached Kyle's sub stack below where he shows a dissolve schedule.

What do you think?

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-01 14:16:29 UTC | #4

While I'm on this topic - If anybody is familiar with any Genesis holders/large holders who are dissolving, please refer them here. I would be very interested in engaging with them here, publicly.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-01 15:13:36 UTC | #5

This is a good take. Inflation is not bad right now. The worst part has been giant neurons dissolving, and that’s slowing down.

There are lots of people though that didn’t have those giant neurons who staked for 8 years. Reducing our rewards further will just piss us off and do nothing to help this token.

Any talk of reducing or eliminating rewards misses the main problem of 3-5 million tokens unlocking each month.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-01 15:18:46 UTC | #6

I am on board. Cut short-term rewards in favor of long term rewards. An 8 year investment is substantially riskier than a 1 year lock. Perhaps 8x as much. Perhaps the rewards for 8yr investors should be 8x that of a 1-yr stake.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-01 15:44:41 UTC | #7

Hey @smaug,

Thanks for participating in the thread! Excellent to see community members chiming in - love this community.

Let me play devil's advocate with your thoughts on *Perhaps 8x as much. Perhaps the rewards for 8yr investors should be 8x that of a 1-yr stake.* 

The amount of rewards one should yield is up for a larger debate. More important however, in my opinion, is the total reduction in [Future] circulating supply. The question that I would posture, " How can we modify the rewards parameters such that Longer term holders absorb a larger proportion of rewards in relation to their shorter term siblings? **A precursor element of such a change must result in a total reduction of circulating supply**."

What do I mean by this? Lets make it simple. Lets say voting neurons in low age neurons are reduced by 10 million spawned ICP per year, but by increasing 8 year nuerons to 8 X, so much more ICP is spawned it actually results in *worse* inflationary conditions, and more outright total supply increases. This would not be good! Rather, such a proposal should result in the total net reduction (If someone more mathematically inclined can fancy such a thought/diagram would be great!)

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-10-01 16:11:26 UTC | #8

Thanks for your great reply.  I am 100% with you.  I wrote that locking all 1 and 2 years neurons for 8 years would solve the problem but I would never want to do this.  I am for respect of promises.  Same for rewards now.
But you got me right, the short term neurons and the selling is the main barrier for the price to go up.
The question we need to ask ourselves is Why these 1 and 2 years want to get out and sell their tokens.
What does an investor needs to be convinced to lock his money for 4 to 8 years?
I am proposing some taughts and hope Dfinity and the community will seriously think about it.  For me this has been grossly neglected and we are paying the price now.  The price is that many neurons get dissolved instead of locking for longer term.

1- certainly the most important aspect for an investor is **Security** of his investment. The way and the frequency the NNS have been changed in the name of evolution is a big toll on how secure is your investment.  If I was a 1 or 2 years neuron, I would certainly not lock longer and get out of all this.  Of course, the idea to kill the rewards is making this insecurity much worst, as worst as it can be.  This is a killer for locking more time.  Huge mistake for even disclosing something like this.  It create uncertainty and there is nothing worst for investors.

2- For investors to lock their money like anywhere else (8 years is hugely long term), the rewards has to reflect the same.  So the actual 20% is not too much, far from it.  Why would people lock for 8 years at 8%?  I will refer them to some stock market Preferred shares where they easily can get 8-10%, the capital is almost guarantee and does not vary much, and you can follow the financial statement of the company every 3 months,  Also, they can sell their shares and get their money within 2 minutes.  So, 20% is really not much now.

So because of the instability of the system, the insecurity and those kinds of ideas to kill the rewards, I don't see any smart person who would lock his 1 year neuron to 8 right now.

I am not saying I have a short term solution but the solution need a deep analysis first:
Are those dev grants put pressure on price.  These grants goes directly on the market..  So need to  balance  those and make sure they are well worth.
How Dfinity finance themselves?  Selling tokens or they use fiat cash they have?  Who knows?
How to convince dissolving neurons to lock for longer term.  That was the goal of Dfinity to get 90% locked.  
Actual rewards are not the problem, I am convinced 100%.  For many reasons, very few reach the market now. Removing or lowering rewards  would make it worst, much worst.  The reputation of IC, for investors, would been totally destroyed, if it still can be more.
The modulation thing is big mistake too.  Investors don't like these kind of things This is not innovation.  These are the kind of things that keep and push investors away.
I am 8 years neurons so I cannot go anywhere.  But with what I have seen so far, I would never recommend any of my friends or family to invest in such an unstable system.  And I would never do it again myself. 
Then and lastly, an idea could be **to create a burning mechanism**.  As an example, since dev have low cost and users don't have any, why not scooping a % of ICP and burn it for financial transaction.
Let say a NFT market,  a user sell an NFT to another user for 100 icp.  If the market place keep 5% for the sell, why don't the network take a 25% of that 5% and burn it?  This would be beneficial for all, the marketplace included since ICP price would go up and would compensate for the 25% easily.
We will need to be creative, not punitive.

I still have hope people will realize these things are hugely important.  Sooner or later, people will realize the price of ICP is hugely important and I am not taking just for investor's profit.

Hi all,

Disclaimer - I am a DFINITY employee, but the below comments do not represent DFINITY.  These are my own personal opinions.

I LOVE that this thread is happening and that the community is taking a data-driven approach to identifying and solving problems.  I 100% agree that governance rewards are not a significant concern at the present.  See this [Medium article](https://medium.com/dfinity/nns-metrics-tracking-the-internet-computers-token-economics-5f50b379bc76), which shows that the majority of governance rewards get minted as Merged Maturity and thus don't get added to the liquid supply of the token (although, I have seen cases where a neuron dissolves and merges maturity just before moving all the neuron ICP off the NNS, but I haven't quantified this yet).  For high-level context - about 0.5 - 1M ICP is spawned (or merged at the time of dissolve) per month, whereas 3-4M ICP dissolves, so there's much more ground to be made by convincing current dissolves to re-commit to the IC.  There's also well north of 200M ICP tokens that are liquid and available to be staked.

**So why did I suggest the idea of zeroing rewards?**  If you listen to the most recent Neurotic podcast, you'll hear a more detailed answer, but here is the abridged version.  The NNS should be a net contributor to the IC's growth and maintenance, however outside of DFINTY the NNS does nothing to contribute to growing or stewarding the IC.  Governance rewards are a net drag on the IC's growth because it transfers wealth from the people who are growing the protocol (the users and devs) into the hands of the NNS participants.  Therefore, not only is the NNS currently not encouraging the growth of the IC ecosystem, it is actually providing a small net negative.  That needs to change.  So, in my opinion, we (the NNS participants) can keep our governance rewards, but we also need to become a net positive to the growth of the ecosystem.  This is a drastic change in mindset for NNS participants.  We (again, the NNS) should be organizing ourselves in ways that support maintaining and growing the IC.  In some cases that might mean setting up parallel services to DFINITY, in some cases that might mean setting up services that DFINITY is currently not doing.

Again, I'd recommend listening to the Neurotic episode that dropped yesterday to get a better idea of why I think these things and perhaps next steps.  Overall, I want to change the conversations within the NNS participants towards being one in which each participant sees themselves as a steward of the IC and thus an active participant in growing the IC.

[/quote]

Kyle, with all the respect, how can you say this, transferring the wealth to NNS participants?  By the way, I have listened the podcast and strongly disagree.
Let's go back to this comment.   99% of retail investors are at lost now.  Personally, I bought all my ICP during 2021 so you can imagine my lost.  I have financed IC and the devs all 2021 long.  Now, are you telling us that the NNS, that you have strongly promoted the locking during 2021, is transferring wealth to me and all to all of us, the loosers?  We are still 50 to 95% down.  The rewards is the only way to reduce, very slowly, our huge lost right now. 
What about the real wealthy, the seed investors?  All the one who are dissolving their neurons now and selling?  
How will you convince new investors to join?
How will you convince actual owners to lock their ICP.

For me, it just does not make any sense.  Total non sense. 

At worst, I would agree to deactivate the Spawn button for a couple of months to see if this change something.  NNS participant would receive their maturity and could merge but not spawn and sell their new ICP.  2 months max to see if you want try something.  But doing something is a Trial and Fail strategy which I am against too.

All of this is very bad for reputation and will clearly shove investors away for ever.

 Or there is something that I really do not understand.  I am open to be convinced with a credible analysis.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-10-01 16:41:33 UTC | #11

Also, Kyle
just want to say that even if you disclose that this is your personal opinions and do not represent Dfinity.  You are a Dfinity employee and have contact with people that we don't.  Your influence on Dfinity is much stronger than ours.  So we still see you as a Dfinity employee when you will be posting here. This is a fact that you cannot separate with a simple disclosure.  Same for all Dfinity employees.

Hey @Coteclaude,
Thanks for the lively debate. I want to drive our discussion back to a data-based approach for fear this thread gets out of control with both of our “Hot opinion takes” . After this, if possible, I’d like to drive our discussion back to the hard data we have on hand. (And from that vantage point we can spar :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
Some thoughts below referencing your direct points:
1.	Is this not what truly makes ICP great? Everything is mutable, everything is up for community debate. In what other system do you feel you have the authority to truly drive the direction of an enterprise independent of a centralized authority? In some facets, I almost feel as though we retain too much power. I Digress. This brings up further questions. Can we enact changes that are immutable for a set period? Perhaps we have a rolling period for specific changes? 

I’m driving towards creating a true governance system with enacted principals to help aid in driving the direction of the IC.

2.	I 100% concur – the rewards rate should be higher for those who bear significantly more time-bound risk. But perhaps the proportion of shorter stake rewards should be thought about in relation to the totality of rewards?

3.	I Enjoy your initial idea to create a more robust **burning mechanism**, but disagree that the liaising party in the transaction should bear the burn cost. Do we truly want to disincentivize those that are creating the applications to bear the costs of burning? I most certainly don’t. They are the very ones driving the value of our protocol. Such changes to our protocol would only disincentivize future developers from joining. This would have a negative feedback loop with already existing devs as well.

I’m saddened you would not recommend ICP as a technological masterpiece to your friends and family. Have you arrived at your decision purely because of financial implications associated with the tokens decline? I too have experienced the unfortunate consequences. But, as backers of the system who both retain some level of governance, it is our purpose to promote change where we see fit. There is no denying the technology of the IC is light years ahead of anybody – the token’s cost is merely one component. (Albeit an important one. And there are some Tokenomics changes I certainly think are merited in the **short/midterm**)

Being a bit hypocritical here, but we delved down the theoretical avenue…In the **Short/Midterm/Longterm** - As a governance holder, I believe our mission should be driving to create a robust protocol for developers to flock to. I had this revelation in another thread with @integral_wizard . Here, I personally had a revelation about dissociating the financial associations of being a governance holder. Before you call BS, let me explain.

**Enacting governance proposals to make our protocol #1 for developers is our purpose**. Token appreciation is merely a byproduct of such changes.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-10-01 17:35:14 UTC | #13

I was talking about my family and friends as far as investing only.  For sure the tech is amazing.  I was a programmer for over 20 years so I can appreciate the tech.

I ask my brother to buy 50k of ICP and lock it for 8 years.  He would receive zero rewards or anything.  He said no.  Can you help me to convince him?  I am kidding for fun of course.  LOL.

You told me it was fair for seed investors because they were early and we need to respect that.  OK, agree

I bought ICP during 2021 with the promise of 20-25% rewards.  I am at big lost, while financing lots of dev for a year.  How is this fair, like for the seed, to remove my rewards and do anything to the seeds?  I was very early too?  I bought some at 300$ on June 2021.  That show you how strong was my belief and my support to IC.  Why only us, the early retail at lost would have to take all the lost and the punishment?

I think we need to be creative and burn ICP, not being punitive.

Taking 25% of a market place transaction fee (not on the nft price itself) can be very beneficial for everyone  if the ICP price goes up by 50%.  So no one loose anything, neither the dev, neither investors.

If nobody never pay anything, this protocol, as good as it can be, will die.  No business or organization  can survive with no fee, no income.  ETH has huge fees and is a success.

The one that are making money with the network should pay.  As first and as an example, these marketplace are they only one making money right now on their fees.  I do not think scooping a small cut on their profit would kill the dev.  

If IC is used only because it is free, we have a bigger problem, much bigger.

If new investors do not come in because they have no incentive at all. No more locking in the NNS.  Everyone want to sell because of all this...  For sure the ICP price will keep going down, and fast too.  Who will finance the DEV then?

What would be the plan B if that does not work and make the situation much worst?

Can we take that chance?

Hi @Kyle_Langham ,

Thanks for joining in on the fun. I hope your appearance in this thread helps to uncover the qualm’s *some* governance holders have had with your recent takes. Let me provide the disclaimer - I’m extremely grateful for the value you have poured into ICP both with/without DFINITY. Please continue to do what you do.

I’ve had a chance to listen to your new podcast, and I agree with most of your take (Bob is a builder, nice lol). To surmise for the broader community:

*"The governance participants are not the ones to grow the ecosystem. Governance participants need to be focused on **how** you incentivize those token stakeholders to grow the ecosystem such that governance participants benefit from it. Governance participants can capture all the value from the product, and token stake holders are the ones who create the value."*

99% agree with your take and believe this is a material problem with *the current structure of how rewards are allocated.*

For the broader community to think on – How would you feel if your Governance rewards are directly attributable to the growth of developers?

Let’s dive in. Imagine a future state #IC where a portion (Small? Large? All?) of rewards are allocated to developer projects building on the #IC. Imagine a rewards system in which we as a community hold a vote (With the aid of the NNS voting system) to allocate a portion of our rewards into developer projects collectively. (Or not? Should each party individually choose?) Lets imagine our rewards are allocated into Distrikt, and it goes on to become the next billion user social media platform. Is it not they who will ultimately drive the value creation for the underlying?

@Kyle_Langham  – I’m not totally sure how this idea could play out, but I am fascinated. In this hypothetical, How could we prevent IC token holders from acting merely as a dilutive instrument to drive the value for developers? This would imply the cycle computation "burn" for their projects would need to be net beneficial to governance holders in the long run (How would one go about mathematically extrapolating)

Perhaps this leads us more into @varon1980's thoughts on Twitter. Should our rewards be dependent on the cycle burn rate developers are using? They Grow - We grow. They Lose - We lose. I like the mutually beneficial structure to this approach. I tend to think this may be the more appropriate direction. Obviously, such a state would ensure longer stakers are receiving an outsized proportion of rewards similar to our current system.

This discussion may be better suited in another thread, but lets go with it. I can always change the tile around if we get more participants.

Thoughts, All?

That is very much possible and somewhat planned, with latest changes to how rewards are distibuted, undistributed rewards can be stored in a treasury and used to pay devs.

Hey @coteclaude,

I'm sorry you have experienced substantial implied losses from the monetary value you have provided to the #IC. I'm in the same boat as you bud, believe me.

I think Kyle's initial remarks on Twitter were half baked and purely theoretical in nature, and have been discussed ad nauseum in the most recent episode of @nueroticpod. (Highly recommend the listen) 

It is my belief he thinks the rewards *should not be eliminated*, but rather, should be indicative of developer growth. Our protocol doesn't survive without developers building amazing projects on the #IC. However, we [governance holders] extract value from the NNS while developers are building. We are both siloed. We need to construct a rewards system that is mutually beneficial to both of us.

@Kyle_Langham, I appreciate your studied analysis of the various pressures on ICP value.

> For high-level context - about 0.5 - 1M ICP is spawned (or merged at the time of dissolve) per month, whereas 3-4M ICP dissolves, so there’s much more ground to be made by convincing current dissolves to re-commit to the IC.

It looks like we can expect substantial downward pressure on the ICP token price over the next 2 years due to upcoming dissolves. Assuming current 6-month trends otherwise hold, at what point would you expect the amount of burned/staked ICP to reverse the ICP price slide? Is it simply a matter of weathering a 2-year storm?

To point out the obvious, current dissolves are more likely to recommit when they foresee a profit.

Ok, just glossed over - thanks for posting!

I like the vision of having a community run Treasury that allocates ICP to developers. However, I do not think the current construction will work in a long run setting.

With the proposition above - unallocated rewards are distributed into a community run treasury. From there, the treasury will allocate to projects (By NNS vote?) My thoughts are similar, but with slight (Important) caveats. This doesn't solve the the structural problems our current reward system has. 

The current relationship of rewards for Governance Participants vs. Developer rewards is unilateral. That is - Developers create value, Governance participants extract value. As developers continue to build killer apps, we continue to dilute their holdings by extracting rewards. This *perhaps* results in downwards price pressure, removes eyes from our token, and ultimately, removes eyes from our devs apps.

My thoughts on this are slowly pivoting into something of the sorts:

What if our rewards were baselined to our developer growth/app usage? (computational burn rate? Active users?) In this system, we would create a mutually beneficial relationship with our devs. The current structure benefits *us* at the expense of *them*.

That is a bit unfair, governance participants extract value sure but they also lock their own money into the system reducing the circulating supply.

Then you'd have way less stakers joining the NNS, nobody is willing to take that kind of risk especially considering the need to lockup for long period of time, it's already quite unbalanced as it is: lock your money for 8 years in a volatile asset with unguaranteed APR, if you add APR based on burn rate it's just not worth it and you might get the opposite of what you're trying to achieve, more circulating tokens  and downwards price pressure.

Hmm, partially agree with you. Companies in the public space can increase/decrease their "Dividends" at their peril. Why can we as a community not engage in discussion on the merits of decreasing? (I already see plenty on increasing lol) Our purchase of ICP reduces the circulating supply, sure. But how does this help our developers? Is our purpose not to increase adoption by means of supporting our devs?

Let me provide the disclaimer - I too fear a rapid reduction would result in younger neurons trying to dissolve, and may further result in token pressure. Tough one for sure.

***Then you’d have way less stakers joining the NNS, nobody is willing to take that kind of risk especially considering the need to lockup for long period of time***

You got me on this one - think I agree with you here.

I would imagine, given the low cycle burn rate in the current state of the #IC, rewards would be drastically lower. But in the future state of the #IC, rewards may be dramatically higher. (Would need someone with mathematical prowess to conceive such an idea/model) As an 8 Year holder (and a 6 month and 1 yr), this would be something I would be onboard with.

An alternative idea - what if a portion of our rewards were automatically diverted to developers, and the rest we retained? (Under the current model)

This would require a way to measure the value that a dev/project contributes. This is currently, at least theoretically, determined by what users are willing to pay for using that dev's project/dapp.

Reverse gas doesn't mean everything is free. Devs are taking risks with their work, just as investors are with their money. But they also stand to reap profits when it succeeds.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-01 20:04:24 UTC | #24

I'm not worried about current inflation cause: 
1) Lots of it comes from Genesis neuron unlocks
2) The IC has incredible potential, so I don't mind temporarily diluting token value to increase my token holdings cause I know if devs keep building and the network can become deflationary I'll benefit from my temporary loss, it's unlikely price will raise at the moment even if no more tokens were minted, I'd rather accumulate by buying and staking so when the bull comes back I have as many ICPs as possible.


[quote="ImagineChadParadigm, post:22, topic:15697"]
But how does this help our developers
[/quote]

Developers already have Dfinity issued grants, maturity coming from the NNS which can be invested via SNS and community fund and possibly in future an NNS treasury, imo that is already a lot.

[quote="ImagineChadParadigm, post:22, topic:15697"]
But in the future state of the #IC, rewards may be dramatically higher.
[/quote]
Such a system will make it harder to predict tokens issuance, I think we are getting too ahead of ourselves with all these proposed changes to tokenomics, imo our priority should be to make sure operational costs for devs are as low as possible and APR for staking is as high as it can be while still allowing deflation with realistic network usage, reaching that sweet spot should be our goal instead of favouring one side.

Basing issuance on burn rate will make it harder to estimate how this goal can be achieved and add yet another value we have to spend time and effort tweaking. In my opinion at the moment we have more concerning stuff to care about than inflation caused by staking such as this one: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-regarding-re-exc-1168-add-non-subsidised-storage-cost-on-20-node-subnets-behind-the-flag/15420/17

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-10-01 20:33:56 UTC | #25

I won't speculate on price, but I will say that the amount of dissolve was significantly higher in Dec - May and has decreased by ~2M starting in June.  In addition, staking has negated a lot of the effects of dissolves, see [this article](https://medium.com/dfinity/nns-metrics-tracking-the-internet-computers-token-economics-5f50b379bc76) for more detail.  You can read my old Substacks to see what I thought about the relationship between price and dissolves.

But my bigger point is that the NNS could and should play a HUGE role in stewarding the IC, including growing and sustaining the IC.  That, not tokenomics, is the key to success.

This is what venture capital is... investing in a product you believe in for long term gains without any idea if and when those gains will be realized.  I think the thing I'm arguing for is we (the NNS participants) should think of ourselves more as venture capitalists, who look to the long term for their payout and are willing to provide expertise and talent to the company for which they've invested in order to increase the chance of success.  Currently, the NNS is passive investors.  If the NNS, which will reap 100% of the gains of the Internet Computer, are passive, who will be active?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-01 21:01:11 UTC | #27

Well not quite, when a VC invests in a company he knows exactly what he'll get in terms of stocks, he doesn't know whether the company will be succesful or not and if so how much, that's very much different from the NNS where APY isn't guaranteed. Imo it's a bit naive to think by offering stakers LESS you'll get them to work harder to guarantee the project's success, what will happen is less people will stake and those who have will want out.

IMO most of these discussions about governance are coming from community members convinced they can pump the token's price by tweaking a couple values, on one side you have people advocating to lower the bar to entry and make the NNS more appealing for newcomers, even suggesting higher rates to compete with CEXes staking options and on the other people asking for austherity. 
It's a reactionary and tunnel vision way of doing things, which I've seen a lot of in game dev: gamers think they can solve everything by doing simple tweaks: buff this, nerf that, but many times the problem requires broader changes, which are often not even directly related to the cause of discontent.

In the NNS case I think we should first and foremost improve the governance experience, e.g by adding more voting options (spam, abstain), improving the UI (dashboard is a good starting point), rewarding long term stakers (let's put age bonus to work) and then look into ways to promote those who are active, e.g DAOs that verify IC code changes or work on code changes dictated community proposals.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-01 21:13:16 UTC | #28

A bit OT but I have a doubt on how yearly inflation is calculated, is it based on a fixed number, e.g number of tokens at genesis or on the current supply? So in 5 years the 5% inflation could look completely different based on how many tokens have been minted.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-10-01 22:57:27 UTC | #29

It's a bear market, with ICP also having downwards pressure due to exchanges' manipulation and hit pieces in media, and the unfortunate but unavoidable unlock schedule. I think it would be extremely damaging to base tokenomics/governance inflation discussion on the past year and a half. Let's go for structural changes that actually enhance the governance experience and relationship between devs and holders instead of making rash decisions that won't make the price appreciate.

Be patient and have a time view of at least a couple of years, don't let this bear market push you into making bad decisions.

No one would invest in ICP anymore.  Good luck to find new fresh money then...

Hey @Zane,

Thanks for conversing!

So, you are not worried about [Circulating supply] inflation because it comes from Genesis neuron unlocks, & because it #IC has incredible potential. This is the common logic our community (My self at one point included) employs when trying to tackle the inflation [Circulating supply] narrative.

Fancy me this – 35ish million tokens were dissolved off the NNS from 11NOV21’ – Present: representing a ~29% reduction. During this time our token was trading for $47.33 and currently trades for $6; representing an 87% drop in token price. This is a material problem in the current state of the #IC. No matter how much we love this tech, I’m worried this type of future circulation increase would be price prohibitive for our token.

Forget the price prohibitive – this may be catastrophic for our token. Why is this not something that we can address? My goal is simply to reduce the circulating supply. As Kyle mentioned in the above thread – there is “north of 200 million tokens that are liquid and available to be staked” – of which, ~86 million represents dissolving tokens. How is this not something that represents a potential for a dire outcome if it’s not addressed?

*Per Kyle - “For high-level context - about 0.5 - 1M ICP is spawned (or merged at the time of dissolve) per month, whereas 3-4M ICP dissolves, so there’s much more ground to be made by convincing current dissolves to re-commit to the IC. “*

We are experiencing net outflows of approximately 3 million tokens monthly. (~18 M $ of tokens monthly) We are not in the business of hoping the novelty of the tech will help to subdue the supply pressure of our token – for which it clearly has not done up to this point. *Why* do we think this will be any different over the next 6 months? Insinuating that this is a means to pump the token price is categorically false – my goal is to reduce the circulating supply pressure.

Interested in your take here.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-02 15:48:33 UTC | #33

Exactly! Devs are taking a risk with their work - but imagine a future state where devs can build on *the best* tech with the chance to have the community support their work? A system where both parties prosper together, or both parties fail together. In this context - our purpose is to drive the growth of the IC, the rewards are merely a byproduct. (But are dependent on their success, to some degree)

I'm not sure my thoughts are fully hashed out on this - and I will think about it much more over the coming days. But, I'm just not sure diluting supply to support devs is a viable solution in the long term. Our success should *hinge* on their success. Does this make sense? Sorry for the word vomit lol

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-02 15:53:08 UTC | #34

I would encourage you to approach this in in a different light @coteclaude.

You have, I quote, "Invested" into the technology that our protocol beholds. We are all in the same boat together. And thus, it *is easy* for us to just continue saying we need high rewards - aka, just burn tokens and keep rewarding me the same amount. 

Perhaps a change in how we approach this problem will change our outcome?

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-02 16:05:00 UTC | #35

Agreed with you @InsaneClownPosse on going for "...structural changes that actually enhance the governance experience and relationship between devs and holders instead of making rash decisions that won’t make the price appreciate."

Would a relationship where Governance rewards are to some degree dependent on developers not enhance this relationship?

I feel as though many in our community are sitting on the baselines just expecting things to change - "Wait it out a couple years" "Be patient" "The tech will prevail" This is not a direct attack on the comments you have made above - many feel this way.

Our community overwhelmingly takes a reactionary approach to issues - and not an anticipatory one.

As I said many of those tokens are probably from Genesis neurons so even with reduced inflation they'd still be added to the circulating supply, Kyle himself even says: " *so there’s much more ground to be made by convincing current dissolves to re-commit to the IC*."
I doubt you'd achieve that by reducing APR. 

We are in a bear market it's unlikely whatever we do will dictate price action, macro factors will. When Sol was still worth 1$ everyone was bearish on it cause "major unlocks are coming, it'll dump" and we all know what happened.

Precisely! Ok, so we've made some ground. Perhaps a reduction in the lower end of the rewards curve isn't a viable solution - but we have both identified convincing those to re-commit is something to ponder. Do you have any ideas on this front?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-02 16:56:28 UTC | #38

I'm a bit pessimistic on this front, many genesis neurons are owned by VCs who participated in early rounds, they don't really care about the IC and would rather exit while still in profit or not at a loss, the IC is a high risk asset and the general mood in the field is to derisk as much as possible.

DHemingway | 2022-10-02 21:48:51 UTC | #40

I think the tokenomics are fine. I disagree with calls of high-inflation. If there was an issue we wouldn’t have 55% of the total supply of ICP locked-up in neurons. Inflation is not an issue and never has been. Just in case you are speculating on price… the entire crypto market is in a bear market. Let’s table this until the bull market and resubmit for community consideration then.

Some earlier posts mentioned purchasing ICP at higher prices, I did as well, $325/ICP last May during the “bull” market. Whomever bought ICP at high prices is on them, it doesn’t have to do anything with ICP, Dfinity or inflation. The system is set-up to reward over the Long Term. I think everyone needs to look towards what’s on the horizon instead of what’s on their plate right now.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-02 22:19:04 UTC | #41

Hey @DHemingway,

Thanks for chiming in! Think there may be a bit of misunderstanding between us, though I can see how my misleading title would result in your remarks. My mistake.

When I broadly discuss "Inflation", I’m *generally* referring to it in relation to the rapidly growing circulating supply. You will note this in my initial thread open where I discuss the “Total outstanding supply” has only grown ~5% since Genesis - Which is very solid and indicates Inflation itself is quite low! (Guess its all relative)

When you say let’s table this discussion and address during the next bull market – do you happen to know when that will be? Do we know if ICP will be around by then? Do we know how long the bear market will last?

I’m not providing these remarks purely to be snarky. I’m trying to evidence the unknown.

Should we be simply taking a “wait and see” approach?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-10-03 00:36:29 UTC | #44

@ImagineChadParadigm 
Only simple question for you.  Since you seem to be convinced that the low price of ICP is due to the rewards given to NNS and has nothing to do with the 125m from seed that comes in the market constantly and for the next 3 years...

Questions:
Do you believe that the 8 years gang, who probably 95% are merging their rewards, is the cause of the down price of ICP?  
And the 125m 3 years or less have nothing to do with the price action?

I will be honest with you.  I don't know you but your thread seems like:
You are a Dfinity employee or being very close to them (maybe a seed because you defend them so strongly) and colleague to @Kyle_Langham 
Due to the strong reaction on Kyle's tweet, you have have been given to task to have investors to swallow this pill with a different strategy.

Sorry, but I cannot see you otherwise.
I have talked about my lost in a post before.  I was not thinking only about me. It was to make you understand all 8 years gang are in big lost.  Mostly all this group. With my recent work, believe me, I know what it is to be all in this together.  And my lost will not change anything to me financially.  How I am really hurt, is to see how strongly Dfinity was promoting the 8 years gang and now, want to remove the rewards because not too many people are locking now, like it was at first.  And the reason to do so is so biased.  If it would resolve the price pressure, I would be all for it.  But you know it will not, as much as me.  You are a smart guy and you know the 125m is the biggest problems. 
The key word is 'together',  ǹot only the muti years stakers.
It is obvious that you have only in mind to kill the rewards.  You are not even trying to find any other solution.  You want to assume the problems are those rewards, with any support proof and your task is totally limited to this.

Can you please only answer my 2 questions, directly with no work around? Repeat them again:
1- Do you believe that the 8 years gang, who probably 95% are merging their rewards, is the cause of the down price of ICP?  
2- And the 125m 3 years neurons or less have nothing to do with the price action?

coteclaude | 2022-10-02 23:46:27 UTC | #45

@ImagineChadParadigm 
Honestly, only talking for myself now:
I do not care that you kill all the rewards.  Seriously, not a bit.
But unlock my 8 years neurons and let me out of all this.  
It would be a win-win situation

1- I would be more then happy to leave
2- You would not have to deal with guys like me anymore
3- No more inflation as you want
4- Unlocking my neurons does not trigger any inflation at all, as you want.

So I did lock because Dfinity was promoting a 20% + rewards.  You remove the rewards.  You unlock my neurons.  Fair, right?

Do we have a deal?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-10-03 00:09:13 UTC | #46

Good (I mean bad) strategy to invite almost all developpers in the discussion.  Of course, you need the most support as you can.

Spiting (although very politely and professionnaly) on investors (8 years gang) like you do is a terrible mistake for IC and Dfinity.

Believe me, I really like all these guys very much.  I was a programmer-developper for over 20 years in medical software field (HIPAA specialist).  This is my main background.

To have success in the software industry.  (talking by experience), you need to:
Have great product (done by programmers and IC have the best one)
Have investors happy (they are the one feeding the programmers and everything else)
Have a great reputation outside the box to attract clients (no clients, no business).  Right now, IC and Dfinity has a great reputation but only between themselves, not outside.

When you own and run a business:
What you like is not important.  What's important is what clients like no matter if you don't.
Confrontation lead to both loosing, all the time.

Creating a confrontation between investors and developpers, trying to get some support. is a bad idea.

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-03 02:38:25 UTC | #47

@coteclaude,

lol, unbelievable...I'm going to try and respond to all of your previous messages in this thread, so bear with me. To answer your questions:

1. No, I don’t believe the 8 Year gang is the cause of the “down” price of ICP

2. I absolutely think the 125 M 3 yr or less neurons [that are dissolving] have something to do with the problem

Every step of the way, I tried to empathize with you. I responded to your posts with thought and respect. In my initial post, I brought the thought forward that “Increasing circulating supply” is an issue that needs to be addressed (This would encapsulate the 3yr or less neurons you have described). I fancied the thought of *how we could incentivize those dissolving parties to re-stake?* I pondered various questions including 1. What if *lowlier age* neurons received a smaller reward – and explicitly stated I wanted 8-year gang to still retain a larger proponent of the rewards. I also pondered what it would be like if rewards were representative of developer success. I'm merely trying to think outside the box.

Would it even matter either way? Did we not both sign up to join a mutable protocol? The only thing in part I agree with you is that 8 year neurons should have a choice to Rapid-dissolve and/or transfer (Sell?) neuron ownership in the event a large Tokenomics change ensued. Quite a valid point. Encourage you to go read John Wiegley's recent comments on this very subject.(Need to personally think about the ramifications of such a change much much more)

I have what I consider a sizeable bag of ICP. I partition my ICP into 6 Month, 1 Year, and 8 year neurons. I have absolutely nothing to do with Dfinity nor Kyle, and found out about this project within the last year. Never cared to invest much into crypto before this – quite honestly thought most of the industry was a sham. I literally came out and told you I disagreed with what Kyle & Andrew said in my initial post.

I empathize with Kyle because he has literally *poured days of work into promoting our protocol since before he even joined the foundation!!!* And he continues to do so, despite all the brash comments directed his way.

If you truly think I have any affiliation with Kyle or the Dfinity foundation, I encourage you to search through my post history. I’ve had posts in the past where I publicly criticized the foundation for not taking adequate steps to address the marketing problem. (Take a look…)

How narrow minded to think I am trying to encourage confrontation between developers and governance holders. I said in my initial post I was trying to encourage civil discourse...
I want everybody who is a stakeholder in our ecosystem to participate - that includes community members, builders, and the foundation. I intentionally picked a group of people across the spectrum.

I'm really sorry dude, truly. But this is not healthy.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-10-03 02:57:00 UTC | #48

Of course it is not healthy.  And I wish it was but it can't be.
From the beginning, Dfinity have strongly promoted to stake 8 years for high APR.  They have created the 8yearsgangs (by Whizwang) to move it.
18 months after, while the staking is slowing, they want to remove all rewards while keeping all the neurons locked.  How can this be healthy?
You do not try to discuss any other solution.  You are only try to take down the posts against this way of doing.
I have never complained about the price going down.  I can understand this.
But having investors locking their hard earned money 8 years and telling them they will get zero returns after the fact make no sense to me.  Does that make sense to anyone?

So, ok , give me a chance to understand then. After taking down the rewards to ZERO.
Does Dfinity would still promote to investors lock their token in the 8yearsgang?
If, YES, how can they do this?
If NO, what will happen with all the locked neurons for 8 years?
Give us the entire plan so we have a chance to understand?
Give us numbers, proof.

And meanwhile, the 0 to 3 years will keep selling, selling and selling.  So, what is their effort to help all of us?

And yes, my mind is made up for sure.  What about yours? Seems to be the very same.

It is easy to see that the current ICP inflation mechanism is best for the 8 year gang who want to hold more ICP and worst for the seed investors who only want to sell.

I am wondering if there is a way to make the ICP inflation mechanism immutable.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-03 06:16:08 UTC | #52

@coteclaude we already know your opinion I would like other members of the community to participate, I would support the idea of ​​reasonably increasing transaction costs and I think it is a great idea to associate the success of the IC ecosystem with that of investors by creating a burn rate that is One more factor, together with the maturity in the modulation process during the dissolution of the new neuron by making it liquid, is a new rate that would reflect the burning rate, where in the modulation process it could mean +~% of final liquid rewards.  Although there is not such an obvious problem with inflation from rewards, I believe that the NNS is a living system that has a duty to evolve for the better and ideas like this try.  If the improved tokenomics is more balanced, efficient and symbiotic, this will encourage investors to be more proactive in the governance of the NNS because the success of the IC will depend in part on them as well. Sorry for my English

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-03 06:48:31 UTC | #53

higher growth = higher ICP burned = higher ICP minted for rewards and proportionally vice versa if growth is reversed. In this way, we reward governance by encouraging the growth of the ecosystem in the medium and long term and dissuade short-term minting that generates hyperinflation.

As long as your neuron continues to be staked, it will generate maturity depending on the dissolution time of between 6 months and 8 years.
Only when you decide to make the liquid maturity in the 7-day dissolution process during the modulation, that burning rate factor would be added along with the current factor price for the final minting, resulting in the sale or dissolution incentive at times of high activity in the IC (high burning rate of ICP) and stable or high price of ICP during the process.  discouraging the dissolution of the maturity at times of massive sales due to volatile market cycles  or at times of low ICP burn.  

With this protocol, a balancing force is generated that will make the tokenomics more balanced and sustainable.

My suggestion is that the overall reward distribution amounts would not be adjusted and would remain on their current trajectory, but that the proportions of rewards going to long term holders would be increased. Something like this:

Let:

R = total rewards distributed in a day
Dx = for neuron x, the total number of days the neuron is staked
Ix = for neuron x, the total number of ICP staked
n = total number of neurons

Then,

Sum, from x = 1 to n, (Dx*Ix) will give you the number of ICP days we have staked. Call this sum S.

Then for any neuron x, (R*Dx*Ix)/S is that neuron’s rewards.

Please forgive my terrible mathematical notation. I am typing this on my phone. But basically your proportion of reward would increase linearly based on the number of days you are staked * number of ICP staked. And yeah, the age bonus would apply too, I just didn’t include it. Something like that. Make sense?

A neuron staked for 8 yrs would get 8x the rewards of a neuron staked 1 yr. But the total rewards would still decline as currently scheduled. This would incentive more people to increase their dissolve delay to harness more of the rewards.

Hey @smaug,

Thanks for checking back! I'm quite mathematically inept :joy: - but think I have a surface level understanding of your suggestion.

Essentially, you think that we should further increase 8-year neuron rewards levels according to the parameters you have set forth above.

Very interesting suggestion. You are basically thinking further increasing the rewards curve at the latter end may incentivize those who are dissolving to re-stake?

This seems like something the community could hash out further. Not totally sure how I feel about Quantity held in relation to rewards rate. (Ix In your above equation) This would disproportionally benefit larger neuron holders at the expense of smaller. (I’d personally not vouch for this specific factor) Am I understanding right? Everything else seems like a sound suggestion though.


@Kyle_Langham  – Is there a way to mathematically compute the proportion of seed round/Strategic round/Private sale round neurons that are dissolving? Really what I’d like to figure out is what percentage of those holders are dissolving, and what percentage of those holders are locking in. I’m aware that dfinity has openly brought forward their Neuron numbers.

Is there a way for you to pull neurons that immediately started dissolving from Genesis? If I recall, the unlocking schedule started monthly from Genesis. (And thus, we could pull specific neurons that started dissolving right from this date)

Such an analysis would provide the community insight about what VC’s/Insiders are doing with their neurons.

For those interested, very solid article. I’d suggest you look at the overall token allocation and vesting schedule.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-03 22:00:29 UTC | #59

It would be linear, so if somebody stakes twice as many ICP they would earn twice the rewards, as it is today. The biggest change is to further incentivize staking for 8 years instead of for shorter periods. Basically the same amount of rewards as are distributed at present would be distributed but with a larger skew to the 8-year holders. Someobody staking for 4 years would earn half of what someone staking 8 year earns; somebody staking 2 years would earn half that.

Disclosure: I hold for 8 years :joy:

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-03 22:44:12 UTC | #60

Hey @smaug ,

Thanks for deciphering - I get ya now! Sort of digging this idea - but think we need to brainstorm  more on how this would encourage those dissolvers to re-stake. 

Quoting Kyle Below:

[quote="Kyle_Langham, post:9, topic:15697"]
whereas 3-4M ICP dissolves, so there’s much more ground to be made by convincing current dissolves to re-commit to the IC. There’s also well north of 200M ICP tokens that are liquid and available to be staked.
[/quote]

Lets assume using the insight above 3.5 M ICP are dissolving monthly:

3.5 M ICP @ current market value (~6 bucks) = $21,000,000

vs. 

3.5 M ICP @ current 8 year rate (Static19.2%, exclusive of age bonus & compounding periods) = $4,172,000 annually. Payback period = 5.033 years holding all else constant.

Thus, the B/E payback for the underlying would suggest ICP needs to be:  5.033 (Payback period) * ~6$ (current market price) = $30.198

Holding all factors static, this underlying price is what would need to be sustained for an x period of time for those holders to be Breakeven under both scenarios. This is a bit of a poor example because obviously nobody has any idea what the price will be, and its totally unrealistic to think the underlying would "Stay" at a static rate.

But in the context of historical prices for ICP, it does shed some insight. Its like herd mentality with the VC's/Whales I suppose - when one starts to dissolve, they all jump aboard the bandwagon as their own proportional future value is being diluted. They feel as if they have no choice other than to extract as much value as possible....How can we change their philosophy? 

I'm honestly not sure what do do here, but I'm determined to strive to find ways with the community in which we can encourage them to re-stake. Maybe its not as big an issue as *I think* it is - though it certainly feels that way in relation to the data.

-------------------------

We could just make minimal amount to deploy 1 ICP (worth in Cycles).

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2022-10-04 01:54:51 UTC | #62

ICP's tokenomics is one of the most sophisticated and complex subject to discuss compare to any other projects. Fixing & changing the current running tokenomics will not be as easy without upsetting some stakeholders. We have 5 stakeholders (End Users, NNS governance participants, Project Developers, Node providers & the Dfinity foundation itself as the major contributor of the protocol) who is each has their own interests.
An idea for ICP community could pool fund and make an ICP tokenomics redesign proposal contest. This to attract professional economists who are proficient in designing better tokenometrics that are fair for every stakeholders. Who are the judges ? All the 5 stakeholders.

smaug | 2022-10-04 12:45:01 UTC | #64

I have a MA in applied economics, is that good enough? Haha. But I know that there’s no reason to believe me until I present proof…

Right now I don’t think the tokenomics of this project are bad at all. The token inflation is not too much, as documented above. The main issue is demand. We can work on the supply side all we want but these aren’t real fixes. The real fix is to get people using the internet computer, buying ICP, and burning tokens.

As proof of this, just think of any of the deflationary shitcoins that popped up during the bull run which are now worth approximately zero. Sure, the supply was shrinking for those tokens, but demand withered away much faster.

Deflationary tokenomics sound nice but in reality they amount only to a slow shifting inward of the supply curve. Unless the demand curve stays put or moves outward, you won’t see price increase.

The same is true of inflationary tokenomics. It sounds bad, but price won’t fall unless the demand curve stays in place or shifts inward. We have seen demand destruction in our first year. Price was driven quite high by speculators and those with other interests. and since this point demand has cratered. The solution is more adoption.

If you want to convince other stakeholders with your proposal, you need to layout your thesis paper with detail calculation, include with the econometrics modelling.

As you mention, that the solution is more adoption, I completely agree, But it still need more clarification, detail info and measurement. Such as, at what specific level of adoption is needed for ICP tokenomics to start being healthy ? What level of minimum average Cycle burn rate need to achieve to balance the ICP maturity reward minting rate ? What parameter of the tokenomics to prove that current model is sustainable ?

What I'm still curious is, what makes dfinity foundation choose this tokenomics model from the beginning?  I believe they have done their research, and if they want to calm the anxious community members who doubt the sustainability of the tokenomics, they should transparently show their icp tokenomics research / thesis paper to the community.

Here is a link to a table of the Genesis neurons, which can be filtered and sorted.
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons?s=100&type=gtc#neurons
These are the "GTC" neurons (seed, early contributor). There are also non-GTC "neurons that immediately started dissolving from Genesis", though it seems like you're interested in the GTC neurons.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-05 01:26:18 UTC | #72

Hey @Dylan ,

Wow, Sweet!!! Thx Dylan - never could figure out which columns for ascending/descending order. 

When you say GTC - I would most certainly be interested in seeing every party. Sort of high level thinking here:
**1. Seed/Strategic** - monthly vesting, 4 years/3 years respectively? (I think so). Starting w/Genisys. Easy enough to differentiate neurons by looking at relative dissolve quantities in relation to total token allocation on Genesis 

**2. DFINITY** - Has known nueron numbers, easy to parse this data

**3. Presale** - Known vesting schedule, monthly from Genesis over 1 yr

**4. Early contributors** (StringLabs/Fenbushi/Amino/Sequioa/And a few others?) - Unknown vesting schedule. (Perhaps no vesting schedule?)

**5. Team Members** - Monthly vesting over 4 year period, implied 6% dissolve rate assuming diego's old sell for tax purposes assumption is correct (No clue how to link another thread within this subthread :frowning: )

I suppose not totally interested in many of the smaller parties with token allocations from Genisis.

The goal would be to utilize this data to expand upon Kyle's neuron dissolving analysis. Such data would allow us to refine the dissolve schedules by party - effectively providing us more granulation in the data.

From here, we could then pinpoint *which* "Whales" who have chosen to hold/who have chosen to dissolve. 

Does this analysis exist anywhere @diegop / @Kyle_Langham ?

Would be helpful in the context of pondering the circulating supply related questions.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-10-05 01:29:34 UTC | #73

GTC neurons are only seed round and early contributor neurons. You can see all of the seed round and early contributor "accounts" here:
https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/gtc_accounts/src/lib.rs

For the seed round, each account was divided into 48 neurons, with the dissolve delays set so that one neuron dissolves each month (4 years to dissolve all neurons). For early contributor, similar deal, but each account was divided into 31 neurons (2.5 years to dissolve all neurons) instead of 48.

I just want to point out that I don't think you're using the same definition of ICP circulating supply as the one used by Coinmarketcap, CoinGecko, Coinbase, etc., and defined here:
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Total_supply,_circulating_supply,_and_staked_ICP

Under this definition, staking ICP does not remove ICP from the circulating supply. So the ICP in the neurons of 8-year gang and everyone else in the community who has staked since Genesis is part of the circulating supply.

The only real ways to decrease the circulating supply are burning circulating ICP or DFINITY purchasing circulating ICP.

Thanks for the Hat Tip! Interesting write up here...

Tell me I'm a fool where I think I'm going down a rabbit hole :sweat_smile: - circulating supply is a projection of theoretical dissolve according to vesting schedule, and not actual dissolves?...

Feel free to read through those articles (https://kylelangham.substack.com/) to get more answers.  From the top of my memory: almost all early contributors are/have been dissolving their neurons.  For seed rounders, a good percentage upped their neurons to 8 years and the remainder (maybe half?) are/have been dissolving.

That’s a big misconception on your part. Rewarding voters for actively participating in governance and node operators for their expenses is how ICP exists today - without it, there would be no ICP.

I think that the structure in which seed rounders without participation in the ecosystem have no choice but to dump is a problem.
They certainly have the right to dump and it leads to a death spiral and exit liquidity.
But I am also against forcibly locking their neurons for 8 years.

Living in a country
with 150% inflation for years, I witnessed how inflation stole values. This
applies in general. If ICP will continue with inflation, it is also valid for
ICP. This has nothing to do with dignity. Unfortunately, ICP holders who are
exposed to inflation will learn by experiencing that their value is lost. ICP
can be a very good project, it can also have very useful high technology. This
is not enough for those who invest in ICP to make money. Because inflation
takes away the additional values created by the ICP from the hands of
investors. I am writing for those who do not want to learn this by living and
lose money. Fans can fall in love with ICP. There is an idiom in our language.
LOVE IS BLIND.. What I said does not apply to fanatics.

Money is ultimately useful as a measure of labor; it's a way of storing labor value for convertible use. The relevant concept here is that a person's investment (labor) contributes to the development of the project, even if it isn't, for example, programming.

This money might be made by farmers who produce the food devs eat. It might be the driver who delivers the hardware they use. Wherever it came from, the investment given serves to pay the employees or otherwise advance the goals of the project, in this case the IC. And it is invested at risk.

To swear off investment is fine if everyone involved is able and willing to work without immediate compensation. This doesn't seem to be the route DFINITY has taken, and probably for good reason.

Inflation, on the other hand, diminishes investment value by favoring active labor. This can be a good thing in moderate amounts. It can be a bad thing if an invested project appears to be delivering poor returns.

Personally, I don't think that inflation is the biggest danger to the IC right now. But you might want to check with all parties involved before suggesting that investing money is "not doing anything" for a project.

-------------------------

willguest | 2023-01-01 12:28:57 UTC | #99

I think this is what you might call a straw ecology argument, somehow arriving at a justification for inflation, but you make some good points.

It goes like this, right? Labor equals money, money becomes investment, investment fuels progress generating new labour, and we all walk away smiling because the pie gets bigger and we each get to have some delicious pie.

Trouble is, you defend the micro with the macro, and vice versa. This would be fine, if it were not for the double standards by which the same system actually runs. Those who control the means of production are incentivized to socialise externalities. This happens with food (see metrics of global food insecurity) now and, to some degree, water and air. I'm only saying there's a lot more happening here than just the rules of the game that you mention. The impacts you point out are real and valid, but they make up a tiny piece of a much larger, broken puzzle.

For the record, I am not that worried about ICP tokenomics (at the moment) and made the previous post to try and point out the simple fact that having tokens doesn't entitle you to more tokens, regardless of how you arrived at that account balance. This is, in fact, codified already since neurons must participate in governance to receive rewards. I hope this never changes.

Some very valid points, but there is also the distinction between investing and trading to be made. When people come to complain about the spot price of their "investment" they are really complaining about a bad trade they made that only provided some liquidity to other actual investors.

I agree there is a lot of speculation throughout these forums about individuals and their individual circumstances without having any valid or accurate idea of "what they do for projects". If "just adding money into a project isn't doing anything" then wouldn't everyone be forced to use grant funding? Then Dfinity would have like 50% claim to your product and things would be worse overall? How do teams or even individual developers produce their projects on mainnet? With funding for their canisters. So, one could reasonably assume that eventually people will need several deep pockets of sorts just to produce a product and be launched on the mainnet and directly own the proprietary/ intellectual rights? 

That *might* mean we have more people who are providing money and then investing because they "want their money to make more money". Or does this blockchain not support a full range of economic choices like capitalism? If so, that's fine but we should probably make that clear.

I absolutely agree with you. You should ask this question not to me, but to the public offering of the ICP for $350. If ICP is $3, why did you supply it at $350? And how much more will you exploit people by constantly issuing new tokens with lousy tokenomics.

Inflation is a tool to be used to correct and balance without it you have bigger problems. [Inflation](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/us-hit-debt-limit-week-yellen-warns-congress-rcna65725). 

History has shown that mighty civilization have perished and without inflation it can repeat.

Inflation on ICP is right now, for those who just want money, exiting and those who are here for the right reason will be rewarded the success of this project and financial rewards later from the strength of this project.

You do not have to be locked in a neuron, just dissolve and move on.

I am disappointed that despite a number of community members speaking about the importance of providing accurate data about inflation, Dfinity appears to have doubled down on fudging figures. Dfinity's @Kyle_Langham has so far refused to address the fact that maturity is a form of inflation and approves of tweets which undercount inflation drastically like this one: https://twitter.com/Firerisk6/status/1614004286106787840
Annualized inflation is nowhere close to the claimed 2.16%. The lower reading is merely an artefact of a questionable tax dodge.

Where does DFINITY come into play what I Tweet? I don't get approval from anyone for what I do? Do you think DFINITY should be censoring Twitter?
