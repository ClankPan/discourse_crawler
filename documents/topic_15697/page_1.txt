@firerisk , what I meant was that @Kyle_Langham liked your tweet, thereby giving it Dfinity's approval stamp, since he handles data and analytics for Dfinity. Difference between approving something and approving *of* something.

-------------------------

firerisk | 2023-01-16 04:34:06 UTC | #107

Since when does liking a tweet become an approval stamp? I never signed any documents that stated that. The information I posted is accurate. There is no way to speculate on dormant accounts that have not spawned or merged the ICP, and when this happens then it is added in to the inflation. There has been a large neuron holder that lost access and others, that I know of, to their account in the past and would have a lot of maturity not touched, so some accounts are actually deflationary to ICP. There is no way to determine this and the information is correct until the ICP is spawned or merged and then it is accounted for in the data. Living, dead, lost access to the account, we don't know until their is activity with the account. If someone wants to monitor these accounts for activity then that would be a good idea. I don't think DFINITY should be assigning resources for this endeavor though.

Never said anything about signing documents, but liking tweets is definitely an approval stamp. How many tweets have you liked that you deeply disagreed with, especially about straightforward factual issues? 
Anyway, my concern isn't about you at all, I have absolutely no issues with you posting what you like on Twitter. If I had an issue with you, I would have responded to your post on Twitter itself. But the information you posted is false and not for the reasons you mentioned. Dormant accounts and dead investors are irrelevant. The point is that voting rewards have been the primary inflationary mechanism in the IC from inception (the only other inflationary process, node provider rewards, currently contribute only a small percentage to inflation), and yet most voting rewards are now disregarded in Dfinity's calculations of inflation.
This data fudging harms the network's reputation. Most people have little understanding of cryptography, but can understand voting rewards, staked maturity and inflation in a few minutes reading. They are likely to think that if an organisation isn't honest about stuff they understand it is also suspect with regard to everything else.

So you're saying Kyle should count ICP not yet minted into the inflation? I can see an argument for and against. I definitely disagree liking a tweet is a stamp of approval. Either I am for providing the most accurate data possible and this one is a little tricky because of the way rewards are issued on ICP. If rewards aren't spawned and unlocked how do you know many ICP will be added to the supply? Do you just approximate? This doesn't seem right either. 

Has anyone come up with a way to calculate it?

-------------------------

Zane | 2023-01-16 07:57:36 UTC | #110

It absolutely should, those ICP are there and ready to hit the market in 7 days in worst case and add to yearly inflation in the best one if they are restaked, just cause someone hasn't pressed a button it doesn't mean they don't exist. Inflation is whatever the APY curve dictate, everything else is cope.

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-01-16 08:33:38 UTC | #111

There is an easy solution already suggested. Since the amount of ICP spawned is at most + or - 5%, inflation can be expressed as a range. Lots of figures are expressed as ranges, and are very helpful when the range is very narrow as in the present case. This will give a pretty accurate account of true inflation.
Is it more accurate to say ICP inflation is (for example) between 6.45 and 6.55% or to discount unminted ICP entirely and claim it is around 2%? Surely the former is far better?
Alternately, if a range seems too inexact, inflation can be calculated using a 1 to 1 ratio between ICP and maturity, with a proviso added parenthetically that there can be a shift of as great as 5% in the final figure.
The current system just kicks the inflation can down the road and it is theoretically possible that a future reading of inflation would breach Dfinity's own set inflation threshold. How would that look?

[I realize I'm not adding much to this discussion, but I can't resist this.]

By this measure, because the US government likely has the capacity to print 10x the amount of paper dollars on the market; and create orders of magnitude more virtual dollars; does it mean that US inflation for 2022 was 7.04% +/- 10000%?

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-01-16 13:21:59 UTC | #113

No, because unlike in the example you provide, maturity *is bound* to be converted to ICP, it is only a matter of time. It is not a capacity to print ICP but a *promise already made* to print it. For accounting purposes, therefore, any fair value calculation of ICP inflation has to include maturity.
A better analogy than the one you suggest is mark to market accounting. When companies provide their financials and results for any given quarter or year, they include the current value of investments, though these values shift constantly and will certainly not be the same when they are eventually disposed of. Mark to market gives a slice-of-time sense of the value of a firm's assets and liabilities. The assets included in mark to market accounting in fact fluctuate in value far more than the potential difference between maturity and spawned ICP, which is just 5%.

-------------------------

firerisk | 2023-01-16 13:44:32 UTC | #114

How are dormant accounts, dead investors and people that lost access not relavent? The ICP and maturity can be considered burned and would be a deflationary aspect. I suggest that we just stick to the factual data that we have, like we have been doing, and add the minted ICP as it occurs.

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-01-16 14:38:23 UTC | #115

They are not relevant because we have no mechanism for counting them accurately. The debate is about what is counted as inflation and what is not. The invention of 'maturity' caused a precipitous drop in the official account of ICP inflation, while hiding the true inflation rate of the network. This is an unintended consequence of the introduction of maturity modulation. The inflationary mechanisms of node provider rewards and voting rewards haven't changed, yet inflation has miraculously dropped.

Kyle_Langham | 2023-01-16 16:07:44 UTC | #116

I plan to provide more analytics on maturity in the next blog article.

@Denis and @Zane, you two are correct. Maturity represents an ownership claim on the value of the ICP token economy. Other than the +/- 5% modulation %, maturity is basically equivalent to shares outstanding (but not issued) for a normal stock, since this represent a current ownership claim on the market value of the token economy, just like shares outstanding represents a current ownership claim on the market value of a stock. 

You will also see another number on a balance sheet called "authorized shares", which is usually many times the amount of issued and outstanding shares. Maturity would essentially be analogous to shares that are outstanding but not yet "issued". By contrast, DFINITY is treating maturity as authorized but not outstanding, which is wrong. 

To look at it another way, for shares to be outstanding instead of just authorized, a company must have received something in return like cash to invest, or services (e.g. for R&D or hosting costs). The ICP token economy has received DAO voting services in return for maturity, and these voting services are a proxy for management expenses in normal companies. From an accounting point of view, the maturity journal entry would essentially be, DEBIT DAO management expenses, CREDIT token equity when the maturity is earned (regardless of whether tokens are minted/issued or not). 

Now whether the ICP token economy is overpaying for those management services is another question, especially given how most of these services are completely passive via "liquid democracy". At the very least, I would assert that the ICP token economy is getting a very poor ROI on these services given their massive inflationary impact. Feel free to try to convince me otherwise.

What I do know is that the market cap of ICP is already at the moon, *in spite of* a bear market, a deep crypto winter and a 99%+ price drop from genesis. With the 54.2M of outstanding maturity added to the 494M of issued/minted ICP, that produces an implied market cap of 546.2M X $5 token price = $2.73 billion. Now compare that to the token economy revenue of 3.7K of ICP burned in November and December 2022 as the current run rate. Since the token price was closer to $4 over this period (and given how the cycle conversion rate correlates to the token price), this implies an annualized token economy revenue of only 3.7K ICP burned X $4 X 12 months / 2 months annualization factor = a negligible $89K in annualized revenue. Again, please correct me if you think this is wrong.

The IC is a great concept. It's easy to fall in love with it, no doubt. However, in what normal investing scenario would you be willing to bet on a great startup concept that is only generating $89K/year in revenue and is already valued at $2.73 billion? To put it metaphorically, you've already assumed you've arrived on the moon, so now you are essentially betting on the strange new world and new civilization of the World Computer, i.e., "where no one has gone before". That's a huge bet, even for a great concept. 

In  short, we always need to be very careful about conflating a great company (or concept) with a great stock (or token). The two are definitely not the same.

Exactly my point, there is no accurate way to count the inflation until it is minted. AVAX  even has a statement, "Unminted rewards not included".  The inflation didn't just miraculously drop, people were not spawning their rewards and thus it wasn't counted. This will most likely change next month as spawning and merging will change along with other variables.

Am I right in thinking maturity is not visible at all? But if we convert the nns subnet into a public subnet then and only then we would know maturity outstanding. 

I am of the belief that unstaked maturity is essentially equivalent to liquid icp, ie it should be counted in inflation. 

Staked maturity on the other hand should not be counted in inflation until it becomes liquid icp.

Why wouldnt VCs care about IC though? I mean perhaps that's not the narrative we'd like to create. The Internet Computer is worth the risk and is much more than making money. 

Derisking implies selling some, perhaps the original investment or a portion of it. But the possibility to invest into the CryptoCloud poised to reimagine the Internet is too great. It's not just about the money but the glory. To be a critical player/ investor, using capital but also your voice, and contribute to building the complete Web2+Web3 solution. That’s the game to play. 

What we want is to create the incentives and the signal for all ICP network members to realize the opportunity. We are making history. Lets align behind the grand goal.

Hi, are the vesting numbers correct?: https://dropstab.com/coins/internet-computer/vesting

Edit: What those numbers show (if they are correct) is that every 30 days, around 1% of the supply is unlocked. To put it into perspective, Dfinity needs to green light the equivalent of 3 OC SNS sales per month to offset the potential sell pressure.
