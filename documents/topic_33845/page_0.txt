Hey everyone,

Hope you're all doing great. Today, I'd like to introduce you to an exciting new project we’re working on called BifiPal – short for Bitcoin Finance Pal. As someone deeply involved in this space, I genuinely believe BifiPal has the potential to significantly enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem by addressing some of its long-standing challenges.

**What is BifiPal?**

BifiPal is a series of financial protocols built around Bitcoin, designed to tackle issues like insufficient liquidity and low yields. This includes but isn't limited to staking BTC, BTC lending, interest swap transactions, and Bitcoin-based currencies. Our aim is to create a financial system centered on Bitcoin, providing Bitcoin holders with the sovereignty to issue a Bitcoin-based global currency. BifiPal integrates traditional financial functions into the Bitcoin ecosystem and operates on ICP (Internet Computer Protocol), the best infrastructure in the crypto world, to become a one-stop financial service leader for crypto natives.

**Ensuring Security with Flexibility and Playability**

While ensuring Bitcoin's security, BifiPal offers maximum flexibility and playability. By combining Bitcoin's strong monetary attributes with ICP's limitless scalability and robust application features, BifiPal constructs a new generation of Bitcoin decentralized finance. It transforms wealth management into a game, making money-making both profitable and enjoyable, ushering in a new paradigm of DeFi Gaming.

**Foundation of BifiPal: Bitcoin & ICP**

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system aimed at building a decentralized financial system that provides individuals with sovereignty over digital identity and currency (for a detailed introduction, refer to the Bitcoin whitepaper: [Bitcoin Whitepaper]). Bitcoin's primary role is as a currency, and the Bitcoin network is a blockchain network designed for monetary use.

ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) is a cryptographic consensus protocol comprising layers like P2P network, consensus, message routing, and execution. It's a blockchain cloud network utilizing powerful cryptographic technologies like Chain-Key Cryptography and Threshold Cryptography, with excellent interoperability among its multiple subnets and external internet.

ICP is a Layer 0 infrastructure that's more powerful and easier to use than AWS, providing a robust WebAssembly runtime and Smart Contract container called Canister. It facilitates interaction between major blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, achieving blockchain ecosystem integration.

**Vision of BifiPal**

Generally, the Bitcoin ecosystem has two types of businesses:

1. **Monetary Attributes**: Projects like Lightning Network's flash payments or Babylon's native Bitcoin staking leverage Bitcoin's intrinsic value to generate returns.
2. **Network Capabilities**: Projects like inscriptions and various Bitcoin L2 solutions treat the Bitcoin network as a data proof layer or ownership ledger, aiming to expand its capabilities.

Technically, BifiPal embraces Bitcoin's technical standards (BIPs) using stacks like:

* rust-bitcoin
* miniscript
* bdk
* RGB

These technologies help build native Bitcoin smart contracts and account abstraction, providing currency-level functionality and security services.

On the business side, BifiPal focuses on Bitcoin's monetary attributes and leverages ICP's technology to solve blockchain network issues, utilizing:

* Canister
* ChainKey & Threshold Cryptography
* HttpOutCalls
* Timer
* Chain Fusion (Bitcoin Integration, etc.)
* Threshold ECDSA & Schnorr
* vetKeys
* Internet Identity & IC-SWIB

Bitcoin and ICP form a perfect combination, with Bitcoin offering the strongest monetary and financial attributes and ICP providing unmatched scalability and flexibility. BifiPal combines Bitcoin's core monetary attributes with ICP's powerful blockchain features.

**Product Features**

Bitcoin on-chain staking is gaining visibility. BifiPal addresses Bitcoin's dual-low status (low yield and low staking rate) by providing a comprehensive financial pipeline service for Bitcoin holders, aiming to enhance user profits and activate Bitcoin's nearly $1 trillion currency value. Here are some of our key products, with more features coming soon:

* **DBank**: Creating a Bitcoin financial identity system with account management, investment portfolios, wallet management, BTC credits management, etc. Bitcoin credits will become the passport to the greater Bitcoin financial world.
* **Smart Wallet**: A programmable Bitcoin wallet offering various security strategies, supporting hardware wallet signers, end-to-end key management, and keyless network custody wallets. It balances security and flexibility and provides personalized services for wallet assets like amount and recipient restrictions. It supports all types of assets on Bitcoin, including Ordinals, Runes, Atomicals, RGB, etc.
* **Bitcoin Staking and Wealth Management**: BifiPal collaborates with other interest-bearing projects to provide different yields, meeting the needs of users with varying risk and return preferences, supporting both B2B and B2C markets.
* **Interest Swap Market**: Besides supporting native BTC staking and restaking, BifiPal supports various interest-bearing assets in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the trading of fixed and floating interest rates on Bitcoin Layer 2. This can expand to Ethereum and Solana in the future.
* **Bitcoin Money Printer**: Providing the safest Bitcoin asset issuance model and tools, users can lock Bitcoin through dual-signature or time-lock + user single signature to issue a Bitcoin-based global currency: Bollar. Bollar ownership belongs to Bitcoin holders, and the interest generated by Bollar belongs to the minters. Yield assets (Yield Tokens) can be traded and liquidated through the interest swap market, attracting idle Bitcoin in wallets to provide more market liquidity. If it reaches half or more of Bitcoin's market value, that's $500 billion.

Given Bitcoin's monetary attribute as digital gold, BifiPal is also exploring the possibility of Bitcoin as M0 in crypto finance. If it can stimulate M1 and M2 in the crypto world, the asset and liquidity scale could be 10 or 100 times that of Bitcoin itself. We look forward to working with various parties in the Bitcoin ecosystem to build the grand blueprint of Bitcoin finance.
