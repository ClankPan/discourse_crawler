Hi everyone, I wanted to share that the DFINITY Foundation is hiring for the contractor role of Support Operations Analyst & Moderator. I'd love nothing more than to see a member of the community receive this opportunity. 

This role is remote and has a flexible schedule although due to coverage needs, priority may be given to those who can support North/South American timezones. 

The work will largely revolve around supporting other community members across social channels and improving our official support channels, by triaging community needs, updating docs, FAQs, etc. 

You can learn more about the position below and I'm also available to answer any question one may have. Feel free to DM.
