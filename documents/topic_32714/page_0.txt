**TL;DR** Reduce the minimum dissolve delay for staking on the NNS to 3 months 

Following @dominicwilliams's post on [possible optimizations of the NNS tokenomics](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/possible-optimizations-of-nns-tokenomics-updated/30352) and @bjoernek's analysis on [possible optimizations of tokenomics](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/analysis-of-proposals-on-neuron-dissolve-delays-and-exchange-maturity/30890?u=manu), it seems clear that reducing the minimum dissolve delay from 6 months to 3 months would benefit the IC.

@bjoernek's conclusion on this proposal was the following:

> **Proposal 1: Reduced Dissolve Delays**
> 
> The analysis in this post shows that the primary method to balance supply and demand within the ICP ecosystem remains the growth of the cycle burn rate. Adjustments to inflation are likely to have a lesser impact.
> 
> Reacting to community concerns, Proposal 1 was adjusted with the inclusion of an opt-in mechanism. Assuming that 25% of neurons opt in, the proposed changes would result in a modest 3.8% reduction in voting rewards. Given this limited impact, pursuing this proposal further may not be worthwhile. It might be sensible to revisit the voting reward function at a later point in time.
> 
> However, a specific element of the proposal—reducing the minimum dissolve delay to three months—could be considered separately. This adjustment aims to attract new stakers by lowering the barrier to entry and merits discussion in a dedicated forum thread.

Another effect of that change is making it easier to go in and out of staking, which could benefit liquid staking protocols like @WaterNeuron.

Following a quick analysis, the **APY for locking ICP for 3 months would be 7.66%.** 

## Suggested Implementation

It seems that this change is pretty straightforward and would only require one change to the constant [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/dfinity/ic/-/blob/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs?L157). 

All the frontends and other places where this constant is used would need to update this constant as well.

I warmly invite the community to share their feedback. If the feedback is positive I would submit a motion proposal for this change.

I’d vote yes. With 3 months as an option, I’d stake my liquid ICP instead of it sitting in the NNS.

-------------------------

Manu | 2024-07-04 11:23:31 UTC | #3

I also think this would be a reasonable change, imo the 6 month minimum delay for voting and rewards is a very high threshold, so I hope and expect that with 3 months more people would actually stake ICP.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-07-04 12:06:00 UTC | #4

I would rather we revisit a prior proposal made by DFINITY that would have enabled rewards for lower dissolve delay.  I think the rewards for  neurons with 6 month dissolve delays are already disproportionate relative to neurons with 8 year dissolve delays.  Reducing the minimum to 3 months exacerbates this disproportionate ratio.  At least with the prior proposal the slope of dissolve delay bonus changes below 6 months.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation-next-steps/15164?u=wpb

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-07-04 12:17:42 UTC | #5

That proposal did not pass, but a large reason for such a lopsided vote was that DFINITY ended up voting to reject their own proposal because they interpreted the vocal community to be largely against it.  Take out the DFINITY vote and it was a relatively close result.

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-07-04 16:27:33 UTC | #6

Thanks for pointing that out. The changes proposed by @nikhil.ranjan, which is no longer part of the forum, are more elaborated than what I am suggesting here. 

The change suggested here is less drastic hence easier to evaluate. 6 months is considered as long enough to be safe, which was the case when ICP was launched. Now that the network matured, 3 months is probably long enough.

I would be interested in seeing further discussions on lowering it to 1 month, but let's keep this thread about 3.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-07-04 19:51:31 UTC | #7

My apologies Leo.  I was in a rush to hit the road this morning and didn’t explain my comment very well.  I was trying to emphasize the change in dissolve delay bonus slope that was proposed previously.  That seemed like a reasonable compromise to justify lowering the minimum dissolve delay.  I wasn’t focused on whether the min dissolve delay is 3 months or 1 month.  

I know it adds a complication, but 6 month rewards (currently 7.9%) already seem lopsided high relative to 8 year rewards (currently 14.9%).  Keeping a single linear slope down to 3 months would mean the rewards are something like 6.8 - 7 % for a 3 month neuron.  That seems too high.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2024-07-04 20:21:12 UTC | #8

If it's because of the lopsided difference, then lower the 8th year to a 6-year. We cannot stop improving the network token economics just because some people might find it a bit unfair.

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-07-05 07:56:16 UTC | #9

Those are two different subjects. From what I understand, you think that longer dissolve delays are not rewarded enough, which is fair but probably out of the scope of this change.

Regardless of this point lowering the dissolve delay to 3 months has a key advantage: making staking on the IC more competitive. Unstaking on Solana takes 3 days, on Ethereum it's 1 to 4 days, on the IC it's currently 6 months which is probably a deal breaker for a lot of people. Lowering it to 3 months  + liquid staking solutions could make it more attractive. Also note that on Solana the staking APY is around 7%.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2024-07-05 10:36:02 UTC | #10

I'm definitely in favour of reducing the min dissolve delay required to earn voting rewards.

Especially because you earn no voting rewards once you are below the minimum, so if you set the dissolve delay of a neuron to 6 months, you have to keep it locked there for a while to earn any rewards, then once you unlock you earn nothing for 6 months. So realistically you need to have your tokens locked for a total of at least a year otherwise it is pointless, this is way too long and I'm sure it is putting off lots of people.

What if we just half the dissolve delay of all neurons and also scale the dissolve delay bonus so that neurons locked for 4 years get 100% bonus. That way all neurons will still have the same voting power that they have now.

6 month neurons become 3 month neurons but still make ~7.9%.
8 year neurons become 4 year neurons but still make ~14.9%.

That way everything remains fair. Only downside is RIP to #8YearGang.

When the vote?

-------------------------

I'll submit the proposal on monday, just leaving people some time to participate before voting.

-------------------------

0rions | 2024-07-05 17:27:07 UTC | #13

We should also open another forum thread about reducing the max dissolve delay. It makes sense to first focus on this side of the problem as the other side will probably create more debate.

As the feedback was clearly positive, I submitted a motion proposal: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131010

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-07-08 13:47:01 UTC | #17

7.66% is crazy. Why would anyone staked for longer durations? 3 month rewards are more than 50% of 8 YEAR staking?

Surely a reward rate reevaluation needs to be done for staking rewards of all lengths..

-------------------------

SanDiegocrypto | 2024-07-08 14:00:49 UTC | #18

I agree, awards are way to high for the short end of the "yield curve" for these staking rewards. I'm in favor of a 3 month staking option, but I think the incentives need to be reduced.

I think this needs to be a bit more nuanced. There are some votes for which the dissolve delay could be 1 day, but others where it actually needs to be much higher.  The whole point of staking is that the voters should be forced to endure the market adjustment due to their vote. If that takes a long time to implement then they should be staked for a long time.  In a **perfect** world we'd have a way to tell if the vote had 'settled'. So if you vote in favor of a code change that takes three years, you should probably not be able to dissolve for three years + a bit.  Of course, it isn't a perfect world.

Things like adding a node are likely settled quickly....either the node joins or doesn't...it runs the right code or it doesn't.  Motion proposals and large code changes likely need a longer lock.

I'd be fine if the delay was lowered to 3 months for the categories that are settled quickly, but would be against any lowering for most of the categories.

Of course, explaining this to a user might be more complicated and that always seems to be a sticking point for retail take up.  But it seems that ship sailed long ago...clearly, even the smallest hurdle is too high for most, so we are stuck asking ourselves if we want the right system or cater to people who are never coming until the system has so much value that they have to pay attention and will take the time to understand.

-------------------------

SamurajSelfieSam | 2024-07-08 14:45:58 UTC | #20

I believe that a comprehensive discussion should have preceded the development of a more detailed and nuanced proposal. Consequently, I am voting against the current proposal, as it appears not to have been thoroughly considered.

How would you evaluate how long a change takes? Are you talking about implementation? Because then the effect of such a change would probably show up even after.

> Of course, explaining this to a user might be more complicated and that always seems to be a sticking point for retail take up.

From what I saw, the NNS is already way too complex for most people. If you're not an engineer you'll probably have a hard time grasping all the subtleties.

Which part? (The underlying assumption of proof of stake that proof of stake doesn't work unless what you have at stake is actually at stake? or something else....just want to give a proper response...I think most people want to see IC staking like ETH2 staking but they are fundamentally different...see the end of this post).

This is why things have been simplified to 6mo-8years.  Those dates are arbitrary, but for a reason that you want people to vote with a long horizon. If they are not subject to a penalty for the duration that their decision affects, the system does not work.  We aren't in a perfect world so we have to abstract.

> From what I saw, the NNS is already way too complex for most people. If you’re not an engineer you’ll probably have a hard time grasping all the subtleties.

Yes...this is a big problem. There seems to be a desire for retail to be involved in the governance of things they have very little information or insight on. At the national level we have no other recourse but to give citizens that may not have all the info a vote because "democracy", but even then we usually just give them the ability to vote for people who hopefully DO know the details.  It seems it isn't abstracting well to technical systems.  Liquid Democracy could fix it, but there is no permanent value or incentive to develop the expertise to bootstrap that.

To bring it back to this discussion...there are certainly some items that we vote on that SHOULD have a long horizon. Whatever the LONGEST is can be viewed as the attack point. Every time we shorten it we expose ourselves to some long-term, information-disadvantaged attack on our network.  If we ignore that we're all just picking pennies up in front of the bulldozer that we can't see yet.

If we could draw some easy-to-define lines between kinds of votes we could give stakers at least some rewards(for example, when we used to vote on the exchange rate, those values were only good for like an hour...we could have given everyone locked for at least one hour access to those rewards).

ETH2 Staking is completely different than IC staking because the ONLY thing you vote for is irrelevant after the epoch is over....so unstaking after an epoch has no downside.

Hi, maybe is not theme related but, Wich is the reward for an 8year Neuron with 700ICP?

Just unified 2 neurons and rewards descent significantly.

Thank's

-------------------------

SamurajSelfieSam | 2024-07-08 21:55:51 UTC | #25

1:  The proposed change further skews the proportionality of staking rewards. The shorter lockup periods are disproportionately more rewarding relative to their duration compared to the longest lockup period. This misalignment could discourage long-term staking, potentially undermining the intended stability and commitment incentivized by longer lockups.

**Disproportionate Staking Rewards:**

The current staking rewards for ICP exhibit a significant disparity between the shortest and longest lockup periods:

1. **6-Month Staking:**
  * Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 8%
  * Lockup Duration: 6 months (0.5 years)
2. **8-Year Staking:**
  * Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 15%
  * Lockup Duration: 8 years

When the proposal changes the 6-month staking to a 3-month lockup with the same 8% APY, the already existing disparity becomes even more pronounced:

3. **3-Month Staking (Proposed):**
  * Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 8%
  * Lockup Duration: 3 months (0.25 years)

**Disproportion Analysis:**

* **Current 6-Month vs. 8-Year Staking:**
  * 6-month stakers receive 8% APY for a 0.5-year lockup.
  * 8-year stakers receive 15% APY for an 8-year lockup.
  * The reward for the longer lockup is only 1.875 times (15% / 8%) that of the shorter lockup despite the lockup duration being 16 times longer (8 years / 0.5 years).
* **Proposed 3-Month vs. 8-Year Staking:**
  * 3-month stakers receive 8% APY for a 0.25-year lockup.
  * The reward for the longer lockup remains 15% APY for an 8-year lockup.
  * The reward for the longer lockup is 1.875 times (15% / 8%) that of the shortest lockup despite the lockup duration being 32 times longer (8 years / 0.25 years).

Hence the lack of nuance because shortening the minimum disolve delay to gives rewards from six to three months does not only affect 6 months holders, as the proposal only focus on solving one issue but fails to take into account it accerbates another topic of discussion, which is the disproportionality of staking rewards, which this motion increases immensely. 


2: Four days ago when you created this thread you stated: "I warmly invite the community to share their feedback. If the feedback is positive I would submit a motion proposal for this change." 

This was reasonable whoever during these days no one took notice, you went forward to submit a motion with hardly no one being aware of the discussion, efficiently while everyone was unable to provide feedback, and the very little feedback given was not overwhelmingly positive.

We now have a motion very important for the community, which will pass or fail before most are aware it was snuck in to the NNS.

-------------------------

Cryptonomicon | 2024-07-08 22:05:45 UTC | #26

@SamurajSelfieSam, your analysis isn't quite correct because you don't take into account how the APY changes when you start dissolving your neuron. If you stake for *exactly* 6 months, your APY is actually 0 because you do not earn any rewards once your dissolve delay goes under 6 months. If you stake for exactly one year, your APY jumps to a whopping ~4%. That low APY makes you wonder why anybody stakes their ICP for a relatively short period of time. 

The proposal would change the APYs listed above so that if someone stakes for 6 months, they would get a ~4% APY and if they stake for a year they get ~6%. That seems reasonable to me.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-07-08 23:33:33 UTC | #27

The incentives for a 3 month neuron still wouldn't be competitive with Cosmos, Solana and Polkadot who had much higher rewards and far less time. Perhaps we should reevaluate rewards for all the neurons and the insane length of time of staking.

-------------------------

Giorgio | 2024-07-09 08:08:52 UTC | #28

How is possible that rewards for a 500 icp neuron was higher than 700 icp neuron? 

Was 0,23 for a 500 neuron and now is 0,12 for a 700 neuron....It has no sense

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-07-09 09:36:07 UTC | #29

It's not. Either it was more than one days worth of rewards or one has a lot longer age bonues

-------------------------

Swatterfly | 2024-07-09 11:05:01 UTC | #30

When you merge neurons it eats away at the new neuron's age bonus, that's why you get less rewards.
So if you want to up your stakes on a regular basis, NEVER merge neurons but create a new one every time.

[edit]
You get a drop in age bonus in proportion to the increase in stake, so if you increase your stake with 10% with the new neuron your age bonus will drop by 10%, thus affecting your rewards negatively.

-------------------------

Giorgio | 2024-07-09 11:43:48 UTC | #31

Thank's for your answer but i made this many times, i erase the new neuron and mantain the old one. That's my surprise whe i get the reward.

Now i'm receiving less reward and waiting 16 years......

There's any other option to increase the reward? guess is impossible to change the disolve delay, isn't it?

Thank's again for your response

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-07-09 13:17:07 UTC | #32

It doesn't matter if you keep old or new one. When you merge they make a new "neuron age". This is displayed and you have to confirm you agree.

This is just a query.

I have a neuron that is dissolving. At 6 months it will not receive any voting rewards. If this vote goes through, will my neuron receive no voting rewards for 3 months?
Or is this not applicable to me as my neuron is dissolving ?  Thanks

Kick1776 | 2024-07-09 15:46:38 UTC | #35

If this vote passes, nothing will happen. It is a motion proposal. That's like us collectively asking Dfinity to make the change but there is no obligation and no code that will automatically update.

![image|690x53](upload://kxbSmEBR5RjTxT9ttpGIbuzcpLA.png)

Can you do the rewards math on this? Because a lot of people are thinking the 3-months are getting more rewards than the 8 year neurons.

-------------------------

Swatterfly | 2024-07-09 22:20:47 UTC | #37

I calculated they're getting 4.07x more rewards than 8-year stakers.
Here's the math:
8-year stake = (more or less) 15%.
3-month stake = (7.66% / 4 =) 1.915%.
3 months = 1/32nd of 8 years, so reward should be 1/32 of 15% = 0.46(875) ~0.47%.
So with this passing, they'll be getting 1.915% for 3 months whereas they should only be getting 0.47%.
This amounts to 1.915% / 0.47% = 4.07x more rewards they'll be receiving.
And this 4.07x is with them only being locked out of their coins for 3 months (32 times less) so their rewards should be much, much lower still than the 0.47%.
I used 15% for the 8 years; theoretically this could be as high as 16%, which would make the "4.07x" somewhat smaller.
My personal opinion is that *self-censored*.  I'll stick to "I'm not too happy about it".

If my math is wrong, anyone can correct it, we all make mistakes.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2024-07-09 23:40:14 UTC | #38

To avoid confusion, I'd like to clarify how voting rewards currently work. The dissolve delay bonus isn't complicated, and it's explained well in the [NNS Neuron Sandbox](https://klgza-cqaaa-aaaak-qcz5a-cai.icp0.io/) help text.

![image|641x500](upload://yuPz0tvR05EaUF7V7u7H7yEvwqZ.png)

It's linear. If the minimum dissolve delay required to vote were reduced from 6 months to 3 months, the voting rewards received from 6 months down to 3 months would decrease linearly, just like they do for all other date ranges.

You can think of this as 8-year neurons getting double the rewards of 0-year neurons (if those 0-year neurons could vote). This is how NNS voting rewards have always worked. 

These would roughly be estimated annualized rewards as of today:
8 years: 14.89%
...
6 months: 7.91%
5 months: 7.83%
4 months: 7.76%
3 months: 7.68%

I say roughly because I'm using the current total voting power for the calculations, but total voting power would increase if 3-6 month neurons had voting power, and I don't have that data.

-------------------------

C4rnif3X | 2024-07-10 11:58:00 UTC | #39

Any change to help the ecosystem, I'm definitely for. I want Dfinity/ICP to be competitive with industry standards to attract new investors. However, this motion feels a little rushed? I think any changes that happen to rewards at anytime should have a more complete plan that is fair to everyone, instead of tinkering with durations down the line. 

I know it's just a motion, and likely to pass, but just thought i'd throw my two cents in.

-------------------------

antoniooninato | 2024-07-10 22:28:42 UTC | #40

i have one question and one doubt

will this update only applies to neurons or stacking that will be made or created only after the proposal has been aproved?

because if it applies to all neurons
even the ones that were created before the proposal was summited and adopted, if it pass, so far it kooks like is going to pass
then will i get 3 extra months of rewards

because neurons will stop recieving rewards after it goes below 6 months but if the minimum is lower to 3 then all neurons should recieve another 3 extra months of rewards

this is why i ask if this proposal is only for neurons created after the proposal

don't know if they took that into consideration or they missed that part

-------------------------

SmartMonkey | 2024-07-11 10:45:05 UTC | #41

I have no issue with the dissolve delays being reduced, but the way it scales is ridiculous. It should scale exponentially in my oppinion. If you make the 3m delay pay 7% apr, almost no one will stake for longer. Plus you are kind of spitting in the face of the 8y gang. And the 8y dissolve delay accounts discounts on idgeek will become even bigger.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-11 11:04:53 UTC | #42

Hi all, wanted to give an update from DFINITY side: 

DFINITY supports the idea of [proposal 131010](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131010) and will vote to adopt it later today.

We would like to set expectations however that the proposed change is more effort than suggested in the proposal and that it might not be possible to prioritize this feature right away.

* The change requires more work than changing a constant. As a minimum, it requires an analysis and security review of whether pieces of the governance code rely on the minimum dissolve delay for voting being 6 months. This is more work than searching for the constant in the code - most work is to ensure that no guarantees are based on an *implicit assumption* that the constant never changes.
* All frontends that integrate with the NNS would have to do the same - for example, it could be that some dapps that allow staking hardcoded the 6 months for giving feedback to users who set their dissolve delay. Therefore, the rollout will have to be communicated and planned well.
* Since this is more than just a few hours of work, we will have to evaluate the priority of this feature compared to others. There are already some ongoing NNS-projects as well as upcoming planned features that will likely be considered higher priority, such as the periodic confirmation of following.

I wish everyone a great day!

Lower dissolve delay and up the APY for 8year neurons while you're at it... :sunglasses:

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-07-11 14:28:03 UTC | #44

Each reduction in units of staked time will reduce the security of the network by an exponential amount.  Cutting the minimum in half increases risk by a factor of 2*(x^n) where n>1. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell where we are in that decay curve. Black swans everywhere.

What gives confidence that this is a good choice? I'm not saying 3 months isn't safe, just that it would be nice to see some significant thought and attention given to reducing security our weakest point in half(and increasing risk by over 2x) all at once.

I guess we can all keep fighting over the APY while no one notices that our network just got exponentially weaker. :face_with_diagonal_mouth:

Sorry to be the alarmist and pesimist in the room...but someone has to do it or we go to 0. :grimacing:

-------------------------

SmartMonkey | 2024-07-11 14:46:47 UTC | #46

How did it become weaker? If more people stake, more people have voting power and its more decentralized. Can you elaborate?

-------------------------

Cryptonomicon | 2024-07-11 15:06:55 UTC | #47

@skilesare can you share some mathematical support for your claim that halving the minimum "increases risk by a factor of 2*(x^n)"? It's a pretty bold assertion to make and I've seen no support whatsoever for the statement.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-07-11 18:34:49 UTC | #48

The argument is epistemological from the assumption that a cohort including 3 month horizoned decision makers will approve more unknown unknown proposals than a 6 month cohort. The falls out from the fundamental assumptions of fat tails asymmetries. More volatility leads to fatter tails. If you want to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller, at least admit the steam roller eventually catches up. We are  moving halfway closer to the steamroller without any reasonable justification.

I think you may have a fundamental misunderstanding of what principals the NNS is built on if you feel the statement has no support.

If we want to be ETH2 then ditch the NNS and let node providers compete on execution and concensus slashing. Let them decide the replica direction and installed canisters by social concensus. That isn't the game we're pitched. The NNS's only defense against liquidation of value by the mob is the amount of skin in the game and the time horizon that skin is trapped for.

Without qed proof that 3 months is safe(not possible with the breath of proposals the NNS supports) the the law of fat tails should apply and halving risk security should increase thr occurrence of catastrophic scenarios more than 2x.  

Maybe 1 month is safe to less than one catastrophic event in 5 lifetimes, or maybe it less....much less. We don't know and that's what fat tails dictate.  We have no mitigation strategy in place....except for the lock up length. In a catastrophic scenario where no voters can get out for six months we have six months to figure things out, which means we have exponentially more options than in a three month scenario because when you shorten the period you take entire possible universes trees off of the table.

Isn't the security of the IC reliant on DFINITY, ICA, and the team holding more than 50% of the VP (without delegations)? I don't understand why you are so concerned. If anything, we should consider removing stuff. Of course, you won't find this explicitly mentioned anywhere.

Ultimately, probably there are offchain mechanisms in place to recover from a 51% governance attack. Maybe @lara can confirm and explain this.

Do what is right...prepar like you need to be ready for tomorrow ...because it will happen...

If i'm following, you're saying the more people pile into the short end of the curve - and the higher the price gets, the value locked is being used as a pool to support the volume? Almost like a fractional banking scenerio?

We have 15% of rewards, there is no reason to assume the pie chart will change in a meaningful way.

I'm missing your pie chart example what does the number of rewards have to do with it?

The 8 year gang can earn and liquidate the sum of their current stake in around 6 years completely ceding the pie. I'm looking at least 8 years down the road. Perhaps others aren't.(and that is the point).

Precedents take years to establish and only a moment to pull down.

The precedent was "if you can't commit to this network for 6 months we don't want your vote." Now it is "we lower our threshold as soon as asked because we think it will help in the short term."

Were you referring to me? If so, that was not my point. My point was that as you lower the future time-decision point of the network, the volatility of future universe increases due more people making short term decisions than before.  An influx of 3 monthers will dilute the longer focused people(increasing volatility) AND open the network up to a new set of governance attacks.

-------------------------

Yeah, a lot of unnatural volatility is never good - in terms of artifically tinkering with things not intended as the original vision. I'm not a dev, so I can't comment on most technical aspects of ecosystems until I learrn more about them. 

I just think messing around with yields will most likely start a "tug of war" effect on the curve until everyone's happy. I'm not saying it should never happen, having new people invested is a huge positive, but this new implementaion feels a little rushed.

The 8-year gang is probably mostly Dom and his friends. That kind of long term holders. They don't need to liquidate with that amount of rewards. That's what protects the network.

This proposal is more relevant for all the Anon69s who can now lock $100 worth of tokens for 3 months instead of 6 and get VP.

Then we will likely have WaterNeuron and similar using 3-month neurons. Probably, that VP as a whole will end up locked for more time.

I think you might be gravely mistaken that it is only Dom and his friends staking 8years, maybe in the amount of ICP but not in the total ICP holders... Hard to tell of course.

But i like what @skilesare is quoting here and that is what most long term holders are feeling:

"The precedent was “if you can’t commit to this network for 6 months we don’t want your vote.” Now it is “we lower our threshold as soon as asked because we think it will help in the short term.”

You set up a 20 year roadmap and there is constant discussion about rewards and the time you can stake. 
If you not ok with the conditions then just wait until Defi kicks of on the ICP, if you don't trust DeFi and prefer to stake in the NNS then you agree on the set conditions.
