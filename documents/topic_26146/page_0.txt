I'm trying to generate declaration files from candid files but the output is different from where dfx generate is being run.

For the repo: https://github.com/go-bazzinga/hot-or-not-backend-canister,

Running `dfx generate` (after running `dfx deploy`) generates correct declarations.

But creating `dfx.json` (source below) in a different directory, running `dfx generate` (after running `dfx deploy`) generates only one `js` declaration file, which looks different as well.

```
{
  "canisters": {
    "configuration": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/go-bazzinga/hot-or-not-backend-canister/releases/download/v0.2.1/configuration.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/go-bazzinga/hot-or-not-backend-canister/releases/download/v0.2.1/configuration.wasm.gz",
      "declarations": {
        "node_compatibility": true,
        "output": "./configuration"
      },
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "efsfj-sqaaa-aaaap-qatwa-dai"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

How do I use the `type: "custom"` to generate the same declarations that I get from the source repo.
