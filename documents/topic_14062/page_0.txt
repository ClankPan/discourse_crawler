Greetings,
I would like to bring to your attention about one of the apps, infinity swap. I am unable to log in to it with the internet identity. All other social apps and wallets are working fine.
I will also raise this on twitter with infinity swap page.
Kindly look into this matter and assist.
Thank you.
Allwyn Pinto.

Hey, you might want to go to the infinity swap discord. No one here will be able to help with that
