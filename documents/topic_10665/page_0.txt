Hi,

Today we started receiving CORS errors when trying to download any data from IC. It looks like typical CORS error when no 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Yesterday everything was fine, so I assume that in the mean time there were some changes on boundary nodes. Is this an error which will be solved, or do we need to look for some other way to deal with this problem?

I've just checked and situation is even more weird. For some requests there are cors headers in response, while for others there are none. It looks like configuration error in one of the machines serving data, while others are ok.

Noticed other people reporting the same issue.

Thanks @diegop for forwarding this.
