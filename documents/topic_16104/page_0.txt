Currently, for a split second, you see this:
![image|690x366, 75%](upload://7RvgsVleQt9LbdxAtQPRugAtx34.png)


Cons:
- Users click a link and the first thing they see is something that disappears before they can read it.
- Flashing things usually appear on sites trying to game an ad system.
- Users feel cheated when they click on a link with one title and get another.
- Even if they read it, most won't have a clue what a Service Worker is. My eyes always start reading it automatically. It's meaningless.
- Showing this doesn't improve security, anyone can display the same page without a service worker.
- Current design decreases security, by making devs remove that check and use the .raw URL

Current code: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/80606b8de2479924c3282c3feb4debf105017d9b/typescript/service-worker/src/index.html

Proposing a change to this 
0.5sec SVG path animation. The animation won't repeat:

New code: https://gist.github.com/infu/ba6d9ecaba50ea29c2f5b506a1e3e945

The repository doesn't accept PR, so someone else has to get it in there.

Thank you - this badly needs an update.

a simple statement suggesting direct e2e interaction with blockchain would be great too along with the loading screen

For what it’s worth, anyone using a custom domain currently needs to host their own service worker and can customize it however they like.

I did this for codebase.org

Page changes before I can read more than two words, don't know if you can fit that into 2 words

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-23 16:06:57 UTC | #6

fair enough. I think the aim of the current system is to provide more transparency to end users. IMO it hardly matters to them.

This is a needed update, We have had users complain about the service worker before and get put off by it. No user knows or cares what a service worker is and what its doing.

We resorted to using .raw for better UX but this adds security trade offs so perhaps just simplifying the load screen is the best way!

-------------------------

Hello all! I work on the service worker from within Dfinity and want to thank you all for sharing your thoughts on this loading page, there is very insightful feedback here.

We've actually already been working on a redesign of the loading page internally:
![image|690x473](upload://wsBqWIKqmCH6aVZxIeMTsKPUbp2.jpeg)
This design removes textual references to the service worker, but also adds stronger branding to the page. I'd like to hear your thoughts on whether this design would resolve your concerns or if this is just simply too much and we need to shave it back even further?

Also, regarding the decision to use .raw domains, is this decision purely based on the UX issues caused by the service worker's loading screen? Or is there some other issues with using the service worker?

-------------------------

Cogo | 2022-10-24 09:25:55 UTC | #9

I like this. As a user not a dev the branding is good and a Loading screen is familiar ie you see them a lot or used too. Nothing complicated about it :clinking_glasses:

-------------------------

infu | 2022-10-24 09:46:39 UTC | #10

This looks good!

Let me try to shave it. I don't mind the branding.
1) The loader can be the logo instead of adding a circle. Besides reducing elements It will also draw attention to the logo.
2) Text 'Loading resources" removed. I don't think it's necessary to say it if there is an animated loader
3) Text "Blockchain cryptography will make this app more secure" - Visitors won't be able to read it, we can show an icon like this instead
![image|236x224, 50%](upload://rBrk22WEzEe0FEzaWJXhfjitjG.png)
4) Putting things in the center makes the page look more transitional
5) Investing in making a well-crafted animation negates the bad effects of having a loader

How about something like this

![serviceworkanim|690x456](upload://twudzhgW7o3TPhHFbxfWWDJoJ7n.gif)

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2022-10-24 10:00:08 UTC | #11

I really like the idea of incorporating the spinner into the logo and I agree that this text is redundant when showing a spinner.

“Blockchain cryptography will make this app more secure” vs the lock, doesn't showing the lock after the logo animation pose the same "2 second" problem where it may not actually be visible to most users?

In any case, this is great, thank you for taking the time to give such valuable feedback. As a developer I won't take liberties on the end decision so I'll discuss this internally with our designers and update you on their thoughts.

-------------------------

infu | 2022-10-24 10:02:23 UTC | #12

If the animation is not connected to the actual loading and made fast. It will display within the timeframe. If the actual loading fails to verify, it can change to an error

Gray design, love it

dfxjesse | 2022-10-24 11:32:09 UTC | #15

In regards to to using .raw, the decision was based on users actually telling us they thought the service worker was downloading a virus before visiting our dapp,

so its a dilemma where its actually less secure to use .raw but seems less secure to the user to use the service worker.

I'd push to the extreme and simplify it as much as possible, no mention of blockchain or crypto at all or any downloading bar.

New users are still learning about these things so lets not scare them away :slight_smile:

-------------------------

FranHefner | 2022-10-24 12:46:39 UTC | #16

Excellent thread! Change is really needed. Can I give you a couple of tips?

Usually what people don't understand blockchain concepts and they want to loading to a common website, anything extra scares them.

That anything "load resources" "load crypto" would get it out, even though the text says it's more secure.

The thing about the logo moving (gif), seemed excellent to me since there is a waiting time, which in the future could perhaps be shorter... then the logo would remain in gif and only the legend "Powered by Internet Computer"

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2022-10-24 12:52:02 UTC | #17

That's very interesting to know, thank you.

As Internet Computer enthusiasts, I think it's easy to forget what it's like to interact with things like this without actually understanding what's going on behind the scenes so it's very important for us to hear this. You touched on that too @FranHefner, thank you.

I'll make sure all of this feedback is heard when re-designing the loading page.

-------------------------

lukevoz | 2022-10-24 15:55:45 UTC | #18

I agree that this design looks better than the current one. However I am not sure if there should be IC branding. It is gonna as well confuse users from outside of the community or web2 users in general. I would suggest to have either no loading at all or very minimalistic one without any branding.

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-10-24 16:44:37 UTC | #19

My two cents - the current UX is even weirder for screen reader users. If you have automatic narration, it gets as far as "Internet C" before loading the new page.

I'd use an aria-live attribute or something to just say "loading"

-------------------------

Seb | 2022-10-24 16:53:11 UTC | #20

I think having the IC-branding (in a non-scary way) is an huge opportunity to attract more builders & increase general awareness of the IC. 
Most people won't care but it could be enough for the 0.1% most curious users to take 5 seconds and browse "What is the Internet Computer?". 

I understand the opposite view point and I actually think there are arguments for it. 
However, the current awareness is still so low (even in the IT-community) that it will be beneficial to let the branding for the moment. Maybe in 2025 when everyone knows the IC, that's not necessary anymore :sunglasses:

-------------------------

lukevoz | 2022-10-24 17:27:44 UTC | #21

I get your point. Still think the "Built on the IC" badge can be shown in the app directly. I am just afraid this loading will look weird to some people new to the ecosystem, but maybe it is only my feeling. Let's see how it goes :)

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-10-24 18:20:23 UTC | #22

I ask my self if a neutral white or dark grey (depending of os setting) background color would not fit better the use case than the grey-violet-gradient or any other opinionated color 🤔.

Would a transition from empty tab background color -> grey+violet -> e.g. yellow or dark blue (dapp background) be perceived as more flashy or destruptive than empty tab bg color -> white -> yellow or dark blue?

Just thinking out at loud, I for sure welcome the screen being restyled and this can be tested.

--

I also notice the above designs use custom fonts. I would be careful about this - i.e. the sw should not become slower because it has to download a font. Same btw. for the resources or animations.

-------------------------

FranHefner | 2022-10-24 18:29:56 UTC | #23

I'm glad the opinion was helpful! 

Are you going to make a proposal in the NNS? @infu @NathanosDev 

Thx !!

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2022-10-24 22:27:57 UTC | #24

When I think of whether we should have branding or not, I like to compare it to Cloudflare. When a site is using Cloudflare's DDOS protection, a visitor of the website will see a Cloudflare branded web page that says something along the lines of "Checking your browser before navigating to somesite.com". If this does not scare people away from using those sites, then I don't think that seeing an Internet Computer logo would scare people away, as long as we are careful with the phrasing etc, as has been pointed out by earlier comments on this thread.

Thanks for your comment regarding accessibility @kpeacock, this should definitely be improved!

@peterparker I see your point about the background colour, but I think no matter what colour we use, we will inevitably create some disruptive combinations of colour since we cannot predict what background colour a dapp will use and I don't think there's any colour that will not clash with any other colour. With that said though, the possibility of allowing dapps to brand the service worker has been discussed before. I don't think it will be prioritized soon, but I believe this would be a much better way of solving that particular problem.

Regarding the font, I agree. "Internet Computer" itself is a path embedded into the SVG so that's fine, but any other text on the page should use system fonts.

Usually, when you put links around social networks, ads, etc intended for new users you use a lot of URL query params to figure out later where they came from and how well your campaign goes. 
Something like:
[https://mydoma_in.com/?utm_campaign=coschedule&utm_source=facebook_page&utm_medium=Some]
Social networks display it without the params like this: `https://mydoma_in.com`
But when you click, you are going to the full link.
Which link gets quickly trimmed by a script that changes browser history so users don't need to see it.

We can add a parameter that the service worker can read quickly from the URL to determine its theme.
Something like ?ic_theme=light (following the naming convention above) 
This way IC can provide a few options at no cost

cryptoschindler | 2022-10-27 07:28:54 UTC | #26

I really support this change!

-------------------------

GLdev | 2022-10-27 08:31:06 UTC | #27

I would keep the text describing *what* is loading. I think the overall concept of a spinner is clear, but stating exactly what's loading can help with adoption from not so technically inclined users. Less is more but in this case a simple text is adding value, IMO.
