Can the dfinity team add a pin function on the sns page? Since there are many projects and not easy to find the ones we are interested in.

Maybe something like icpswap? below:

So that we could pin the projects that we are interested in.

Hey @daijianlin, thanks a lot for the feedback! There are several features and design updates currently in progress that will address exactly this. Not promising deadlines, but keep an eye out for updates!
