**Introduction**

Hello everyone, CrossChain Labs is pleased to announce that [**Querio**](https://querio.io/) is live on https://querio.io/

[**Querio**](https://querio.io/) is a search engine of exceptional speed and accuracy that empowers its users to search over the Internet Computer. The search results returned by Querio have a level of specificity that exceeds those produced by other web3.0 search engines.

**What it does?**

* empowers users to search for multiple words at the same time
* provides autocomplete suggestions as the user types words, designed to make it faster to perform searches
* returns accurate results almost instantly
* displays the number of search results and the duration taken by the search process
* exhibits each canister’s logo
* show content snippets derived from the information retrieved on the searched pages
* implements pagination for displaying search results
* efficiently scrapes all canisters of the Internet Computer within a span of 24 hours, in order to keep the search results as current as possible.

**Inspiration**

The idea of Querio came to our mind during the ICP.lab Business Booster, PR&Marketing session, when Shruti Sutwala presented the Web2 -> Web3 equivalents and we noticed that an accurate, fast and reliable search engine equivalent dedicated to ICP was missing. 

From that point forward, we started the development of Querio and have been solely financing the research, development, infrastructure and release.

**What’s next?**

Our main focus is on expediting the launch of Querio SNS DAO. Once the token is created, we will proceed with the development of additional functionalities. Our vision for [**Querio**](https://querio.io/) is to evolve into a cross-chain web3 search engine, by expanding the scope of its searches to cover various web3 chains, including Ethereum.

The forthcoming plan is to:

* Publish the white paper and roadmap
* Create a campaign on [Funded](https://funded.app/)
* Launch Querio SNS DAO

That’s cool, I’m excited to read the paper and see you on the Funded app.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-05-04 02:29:17 UTC | #4

Is there any part of Querio built on the Internet Computer? Or is this entirely off-chain?

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2023-05-04 03:17:29 UTC | #5

What is the team behind that project??

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-04 03:53:13 UTC | #6

@NathanosDev this part is work in progress.

In the second half of March, we started our work on Querio and accomplished the development of the product from idea to launch within less than two months. 

Our primary goal was to determine if it was possible to develop an advanced search engine for the Internet Computer and now we’re working on the process of transferring its code on-chain.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-04 03:57:28 UTC | #7

@Heihachi we’re 2 FTE and 2 PTE. All with a tech background.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-04 04:12:45 UTC | #8

Meanwhile... the other search engine [Kinic](https://74iy7-xqaaa-aaaaf-qagra-cai.raw.ic0.app/) already has code that works 100% on-chain and is soon to be community driven DAO.

Is this a for real project or a meme one?

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-04 04:34:06 UTC | #9

@apotheosis, during the development process of Querio we became aware that Kinic started on a grant nearly a year ago.

But try searching different words, for example “whitepaper”. Check the results and you’ll see the differences: 8 results from Kinic, 86 results from Querio. In addition, Kinic doesn’t support multiple-word searches, content snippet, results counter, canister’s logo, autocomplete suggestions while typing, and so on. 

As mentioned, we are now we’re working on the process of transferring Querio’s code on-chain. It won’t take long.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-04 04:44:15 UTC | #10

As you mentioned above the total work for those features took your team two months... if you do SNS you will need to open source, what stops Kinic from just using your open-source code or building better code (as the Kinic DAO members are very creative and original)?

-------------------------

benji | 2023-05-04 07:54:56 UTC | #11

Nothing should prevent other people from commercially using open source code if the licensing terms allow. That is the spirit of open source software.

That being said I doubt attacking other projects is the best way to promote your own.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-04 08:21:17 UTC | #12

There are a few issues here.

1. It is off-chain completely. 

2. Consumers can choose which they like better.
I tried both and for certain terms they do well.. for others not so much. Subtitles are a big mess..

3. It is a copy when there are infinite ideas that are needed in the world. Just why? 

3. “My project”? Kinic is going to be run by a DAO. I receive 0 from SNS or anything else. I think the DAO version with multiple devs globally, and 100% on-chain is going to do very well. 

I think we can all agree that if a new slightly modified off-chain version of ICP came out.. we would share what we think.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-05 08:38:23 UTC | #13

@apotheosis thanks for your observations, we’ll address them one by one:

> 1. It is off-chain completely.

Is off-chain just for now, will be on-chain soon. It appears that Kinic is not entirely on-chain as only its frontend is running on a canister. It also seems that an web2.0 search API is what is being used by Kinic’s frontend canister.

> 2. Consumers can choose which they like better. I tried both and for certain terms they do well… for others not so much. Subtitles are a big mess…

We appreciate your feedback, and we are continuously improving Querio.

> 3. It is a copy when there are infinite ideas that are needed in the world. Just why?

The idea of Querio came to our mind during the ICP.lab Business Booster, PR&Marketing session, when Shruti Sutwala presented the Web2 → Web3 equivalents and we noticed that a search engine equivalent dedicated to ICP was missing, Kinic was not on that list. During the development process of Querio we became aware that Kinic started on a grant nearly a year ago. The existence of competition leads to the development of superior products, thus we extend our best wishes to you.

> 4. “My project”? Kinic is going to be run by a DAO. I receive 0 from SNS or anything else. I think the DAO version with multiple devs globally, and 100% on-chain is going to do very well.

Not sure of which project you’re referring to, but Kinic started on a Dfinity grant nearly a year ago. On the other hand, Querio has been funded solely by us.

-------------------------

memetics | 2023-05-04 08:50:23 UTC | #14

Works better than Kinic, however the name Querio is quite strange I think rebrand would do well is there any way to get involved in the project early I.e nfts etc

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-04 10:12:54 UTC | #15

***1. It is off-chain completely.***

Please do not post lies or half-truths..
Kinic already has both... they are toggled on and off for testing pre-SNS. The backend has equivalent versions for both on-chain and off-chain support. After the SNS it was planned to have just the 100% on-chain version running. The key here is that both web2 and web3 devs have been using Kinic API.

***3. Competition is good..***

But in a small emerging space like the IC it sets a bad precedent. Now anyone can throw together a 100% off-chain version of any dApp and make a post right before an SNS... "Look its better because it works off-chain.."

***4. Kinic won its category in Supernova hackathon.. It was not a grant***

It had a very similar start as you do with a one month development time that slowly grew into a community worthy DAO. Can it be better? Yeah!

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-04 10:03:43 UTC | #16

Thank you @benji for your comment.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-04 10:01:36 UTC | #17

Thanks @memetics, for sharing your thoughts. 

We chose “Querio” because is a unique name, easy to remember, that suggests the idea of searching or querying. Additionally, we felt the name has a modern and innovative feel to it, which can be appealing for users.

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-04 10:02:02 UTC | #18

It seems that you are using Google Analytic cookies.. but are in the EU. 
I think a banner that you are collecting user data is needed.

How does hits compare with duckduckgo or other web2 search engines?

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-04 14:44:52 UTC | #20

According to [Google EU-focused data and privacy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12017362?hl=en): 

“When collecting data, Google Analytics 4 does not log or store IP addresses. Analytics drops any IP addresses that it collects from EU users before logging that data via EU domains and servers.” 

There shouldn’t be any privacy concerns since we don’t store users data and don’t use ads.

devmandan | 2023-05-04 16:42:33 UTC | #21

very handy. Nice work!

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-04 22:44:49 UTC | #22

Ok, but how do you trust them?

Web3 is all about decentralisation, open-source, and user ownership. Everything that I read so far seems like you use AWS, and Google: probably with special web2 search software that will be hard to port to the IC. Elastic search?

> The forthcoming plan is to:

* Publish the white paper and roadmap
* Create a campaign on Funded
* Launch Querio SNS DAO

This reads like a cash grab. 

As another poster mentioned above, the timing is very suspicious. 

You could have released a few weeks after the native IC search engine did its SNS and then you would need to build a superior on-chain web3 native version to compete. Rather you went for the 'steal the thunder' approach for points two and three above. 

Can you please share how you plan to make this more web3? 
How will this alter you current business model and search technology?

How and when will you port your database and open-source it?

Recently Origyn, CanScale, and Kinic open-sourced their version: CanDB. 
Do you plan on using or contributing to this?

Thank you.

@fuzzykitten, thanks for your feedback. By using Google Analytics we wanted to track the impact that Querio has on the community. We take into account the possibility of replacing it with a decentralised alternative once we move on-chain.

> The forthcoming plan is to:
>

As you may have noticed, we financed the project ourselves and have the ability to continue doing so. However, to establish a more stable foundation and provide the community with an opportunity to invest in Querio, we will soon be launching a Funded campaign. The future Funded campaign comes naturally as we received many requests from the community.“

Do you agree that having an alternative where the search is actually working fast and returns accurate results is beneficial for the community? We decided te release as soon as possible to provide Querio to the community.

Querio represents an investment we're actively making, because we believe in its potential. We have the right knowledge to do it. Part of the team has been previously working at Consensys and have +15 years of software development experience each. We believe in us building the fastest and most accurate Web3 search engine and we’ll not stop until this is accomplished.

The timing is purely coincidental, not a plan orchestrated by us. We concluded that Kinic’s SNS launch is not something that concerns us. They’ll do their job we’ll do ours.

> Can you please share how you plan to make this more web3?
> How will this alter you current business model and search technology?
> 
> How and when will you port your database and open-source it?

Our primary goal was to give the community a needed tool that actually works. Now we’re focusing on the process of transferring Querio code on-chain. Our vision for Querio is to evolve into a cross-chain web3 search engine, by expanding the scope of its searches to cover other blockchains.

We’ll soon publish the whitepaper and roadmap, where you’ll find all the details. We’ll announce it on the forum when the time comes.

>Recently Origyn, CanScale, and Kinic open-sourced their version: CanDB.
>Do you plan on using or contributing to this?

Currently there’s no plan on using or contributing to CanDB.

>Thank you.

Thank you for requesting clarifications and hope we addressed them right.

-------------------------

pphaolu | 2023-05-05 08:58:24 UTC | #25

I think Kinic is also like a cash grab. With these 2 search engine projects, with the current demos, I would not participate anyone in SNS.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-05 09:21:26 UTC | #26

We do hope that you will reconsider your position in the near future. As we are committed to doing everything in our power to meet the community's expectations and deliver the best possible outcomes. 

Could you provide us with suggestions on how to improve Querio?

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2023-05-05 09:21:28 UTC | #27

Since you mentioned that you aren’t planning to use CanDb, what are you planning to use if you move to chain?  Is it going to be 100% on chains  or partially? Competition is good for all and wish success to all. Are you planning to be fully on chain before the Funded?

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 09:43:54 UTC | #28

I think kinic may be powerful in technology, and querio may be more in line with usage habits! Since the same market is the same, before the market is established, I think the two of you can merge into one company and jointly expand the market. Wouldn’t it be better? After all, icp users may only choose one in the end

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-05 10:42:12 UTC | #29

Thanks @aSpace1. At the moment the plan is to bring Querio partially on-chain. This will be done before the Funded.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-05 10:43:13 UTC | #30

@icper I believe that competition drives innovation, and I am confident that Querio will become more and more powerful.

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-05 10:47:09 UTC | #31

This is actually the better idea. If they worked together on the same open-source it would make a super power. This is how I see web3 working well. 

One open-source 100% on-chain with a SNS.
One closed-source and partially on-chain.

Does not seem like an additive contribution to the space. They both need to be Open-source and 100% on-chain, and ideally working together in some way.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 11:55:48 UTC | #32


I still stick to my point of view, as a member of the icp community, why not form a common goal to expand the market? Some projects only support Plug wallet login, some only support bitfinity wallet login, users have to download more wallets, why no one comes out to unify? Two search engine projects are also competing, and we have to choose one of them. In fact, if you two work together is what we want, SNS may be more prosperous than imagined! If you guys insist on competing, many people will be bothered and won't even make an SNS investment for either party?

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-05 13:34:29 UTC | #33

I agree with this. ICP is needs unity at this time.
All devs should be helping each other and adding code that is shared and usable by all.
Not competing with off-chain resources like they are on-chain; it does not add anything new or helpful into the ecosystem.

Will you reconsider using and contributing to any of the on-chain database systems that people are already using? Will you consider contributing to open-source in the ecosystem?

Lastly, SNS is only for 100% on-chain apps. That is the way the SNS secures them. 
It is not ideal to have SNS proposals for things that are not even near to being on-chain yet.

-------------------------

fuzzykitten | 2023-05-07 01:42:52 UTC | #35

[quote="andreea, post:24, topic:19743"]

[/quote]

Why not just contribute to the open-source tools Kinic and others are using for on-chain search?
This is what is confusing. Then anyone can use it for their sites. Also not sure what "actually works" means as above many mention that both Kinic and Querio need improvements. Another reason they should be contributing to Internet Computer open-source.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-07 05:30:39 UTC | #36

@icper @fuzzykitten thanks for your comments. 

We released Querio to contribute to the community. At the moment there’s no need to login with a wallet, anyone can use Querio as it is. 

The frontend as well as the search engine will eventually become open source.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-07 05:40:21 UTC | #37

We’re pleased to announce that a recent update to Querio has been made and is now live!

With its latest changes Querio:
* returns improved search results
* displays cleaner content snippets that highlight the searched keywords
* has a new ranking algorithm, which enhances the searching experience

-------------------------

timo | 2023-05-07 14:41:28 UTC | #38

Thanks for starting this project and congrats to what you achieved and launched in such a short time.

I don't understand most of the criticism raised in this thread. What the ICP needs at this stage is experimentation. Two small teams with different ideas is better than one large team that has to compromise. Open-source code is only beneficial when it's mature. I prefer if people take their time with it instead of publishing half-baked code that doesn't help anyone.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-07 16:12:28 UTC | #40

Thank you, @timo! We appreciate your thoughts and hope that more members of the community share similar perspectives.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-07 16:14:13 UTC | #41

Thanks @Phasma for expressing your privacy concerns. It is worth noting that other dApps operating on ICP also use Google Analytics.

As previously mentioned, we want to track the impact that Querio has on the community. GA4 respects user's privacy, but we take into account the possibility of replacing it with a decentralised alternative once we move on-chain.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-08 12:39:10 UTC | #42

I guess competition only "hurts" in this case, when same projects looking to get their hands on free money. At least the 3rd search engine on the IC wont have this problem.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-08 16:22:49 UTC | #43

@ZackDS thanks for your thoughts. Unfortunately I’m not sure who’s hurting who, what “free” money are you referring to and which is the 3rd engine. But I do hope that the community will continue to appreciate the good work we're doing, by using Querio. We have many features yet to release.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-08 19:10:03 UTC | #44

[/quote]

What would you call this if not free money ? I personally am all for competition and Open Source Code that we can audit. Even if you are not specific DEFI like Sonic there still should be reasonable steps to take before going all in on SNS .

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-08 20:25:13 UTC | #45

Those are big steps that we’ll eventually make. I’m not sure what’s your background, but accomplishing what we did with Querio in such a brief period of time required an immense amount of effort. 

But thanks for following our thread. More awesome features will come.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-08 20:33:13 UTC | #46

What was the hurry ? I will share my repo when it's finished so you can take a look at the code.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-08 21:06:02 UTC | #47

Our primary goal was to give the community a needed search engine that is fast and accurate.

Try searching different words, for example “[whitepaper](https://querio.io/search/whitepaper)”. Check the results and you’ll see the differences: 
9 results from the other search engine, 89 results from Querio.

Try searching “[stake](https://querio.io/search/stake)”. Check the results and you’ll see the differences:  
79 results from the other search engine, 117 results from Querio. 

Try searching “[internet computer](https://querio.io/search/internet%20computer)”. Check the results and you’ll see the differences:  
300 results from the other search engine, 645 results from Querio. 

Try searching “[nft](https://querio.io/search/nft)”. Check the results and you’ll see the differences:  
300 results from the other search engine, 1415 results from Querio. 

In the initial post, we disclosed our forthcoming plans to provide greater clarity.   And as mentioned before, the frontend as well as the search engine will eventually become open source.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-09 06:52:55 UTC | #48

Don't want to turn this into an argument I am not against you, that being said. I have an issue with your page that looks shady AF to say the least . Has nothing to suggest it's a search engine for web3/IC or the "for theCommunity" as you like to point out every time you got the chance. No about section, no team NOTHING,  just some links to a few Dapps, and after a search you don't even have a back button/option. Also you keep mentioning quantity over quality and compare totally off-chain to on-chain so that is it for now. 

[quote="andreea, post:9, topic:19743"]
we are now we’re working on the process of transferring Querio’s code on-chain. It won’t take long.
[/quote]
When you brag about how much you did in such little time and then complain about the same thing just  makes people trust you less. 
So yeah that being said we will gladly help you with issue you may have when you deploy to the IC.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-09 10:17:09 UTC | #49

Thanks @ZackDS for pointing us that

>  after a search you don’t even have a back button/option.

We fixed it.

> No about section, no team NOTHING

We’ll soon add them.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-09 10:21:13 UTC | #50

We're excited to announce that Querio's frontend is now fully operational on-chain: https://krcmj-3iaaa-aaaan-qdpoq-cai.icp0.io/

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-09 11:02:42 UTC | #51

Sorry for being cranky but my leg hurts and as it turns out I am always mean. Anywho I was expecting a bit more from you as part of the Labs, also you could consider a dark mode switch. Also maybe you did but it looks like this on my part :poop: 
![Fix0|690x317](upload://d5xS6614Bw5Xh4umbN5yxUofcct.png) no fix and if inserted a "?" it hang forever : 
![Fix1|690x352](upload://Ai4HzxLP3fXHsHBxTzwACqAOv4i.png)
So if that is what you call fully operational maybe needs more testing from "the community" .

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-09 12:14:40 UTC | #52

Thanks for highlighting the issue. We fixed it. 

It is always helpful to receive suggestions from the community. Currently, we do not have any plans to incorporate a dark mode switch, however, we will certainly consider it in the future.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-10 08:01:56 UTC | #53

OK what exactly is that you fixed ? Still the same on IC no changes.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-05-09 14:03:39 UTC | #54

I wouldn't rush to add an about section on Querio. I completely disagree with @ZackDS regarding needing an about section - it's a search engine and looks sleek AF as Zack would say. It's for searching - not for self promoting the brilliant devs working on the project. When you do your raise on Funded - that is a perfect platform to tell us all about the dev-team and who you are. Best of luck. Competition is needed on the IC. Look at all the social apps that are on the IC for example - how many will survive and fail? Every project will not succeed - competition brings out the best. Iron sharpens iron.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-05-10 04:23:42 UTC | #56

Welcome to the IC. Competition is a good thing. The best will survive.

Querio has undergone numerous updates that enhance the appearance and overall user experience!

Additionally, [querio.io](https://querio.io/) is now on IC canister.

Try it and let us know what you think! Every suggestion is important to us.

plsak | 2023-05-13 18:32:55 UTC | #58

Well, without DFINITY funding (?!, and that is how it should be...), well done, this is gonna be a battle with KINIC (I just hope it won't be the case when two are fighting and third one laughs):

[**Querio**](https://querio.io/) is evolving!

Our team is working tirelessly to develop Querio's newest feature: the 'Code' tab.

'Code' will provide you with the ability to effortlessly search any open-source code and projects within the ICP ecosystem on GitHub.

**[Querio](https://querio.io/) code search** is live and it puts the ICP ecosystem’s code at your fingertips!

‘</>Code’ can search through the open-source code within the entire ICP ecosystem. The new feature is designed especially for the ICP community, with a particular focus on developers.

Getting help and inspiration on writing motoko code is now easier with Querio. Our team is already using ‘</>Code’ internally to speed up the development of Querio’s search engine using Motoko.

Additionally ‘</>Code’ comes with predefined search keywords that modify the way Querio retrieves results:
> 
> **mo:** - perform searches only on .mo files,. Eg: “**mo: hashmap**” will return all .mo files that contain the word “hashmap”
> 
> **js:** - perform searches only on .js files. Eg: “**js: canister**” will return all .js files that contain the word “canister”
>  
> **ts:** - perform searches only on .ts files. Eg: “**ts: canister**” will return all .ts files that contain the word “canister”
>  
> **rs:** - perform searches only on .rs files. Eg: “**rs: mutex**” will return all .rs files that contain the word “mutex”
>  
> **md:** - perform searches only on .md files,. Eg: “**md: game**” will return all .md files that contain the word “game”
>  
> **jsx:** - perform searches only on .jsx files,. Eg: “**jsx: swap**” will return all .jsx files that contain the word “swap”
>

Exciting News: Querio’s search engine goes on-chain!

We're thrilled to announce that Querio has made a significant step towards decentralization - our search engine is now running on-chain! 

Querio team has spared no effort in achieving this incredible milestone ahead of the highly anticipated [Funded](https://funded.app/projects/querio-7719155) campaign, scheduled to launch on Thursday, June 15th. 

This great achievement was led by enthusiastic requests from our valued community. Thank you for your involvement!

When is this open-sourced?

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-06-12 05:03:25 UTC | #65

Our target for the launch of SNS is set for Q4 2023. That's the moment when Querio will become open-sourced.

For more clarity we do have a list of features and a timeline for them.

By the end of Q4 2023:

* Migrate Querio’s search engine to operate entirely on the Internet Computer platform
* Introduce a dedicated tab for NFTs search, expanding Querio’s capabilities to include searching for NFTs
* Enable the possibility to promote projects that match the queried keywords, ensuring the project appears prominently among the top results. The promoted projects will be tagged as "Promoted"
* Implement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). TF-IDF is a widely used algorithm for indexing and ranking documents based on term frequency and inverse document frequency
* **SNS** launch

2024:

* Add auction mechanism so users can get a spot in the featured apps on the home page
* Login with wallet to pay for promoted search results and auctions
* Empower decentralized content miners to provide verifiable content, that once validated will fuel the search engine of Querio, ensuring a decentralized and trustworthy information ecosystem. The validation process of decentralized content is meticulously designed to be reliable and trusted
* Enable multi-chain support. This will facilitate the discovery of dApps built on various blockchains
* Implement Querio Shopping, the ultimate marketplace for buying and selling NFT items. Querio Shopping enables users to effortlessly engage in NFT transactions, discovering a world of endless creativity, art, collectibles, and digital assets.

Please note that this roadmap is a draft, and there may be minor changes when we release the whitepaper. 

Because the community previously asked, we can also state that ML and AI are on our table. But the upcoming 2024 features have higher priority, especially the inclusion of ETH dApps (and other blockchains) to Querio, the implementation of content miner architecture and Querio Shopping.

This is perfect timing for the Funded funding round as the Kinic SNS decentralization sale is also occurring right now. I subscribe to the investment thesis that if I have X amount to invest in Web3 decentralized search and there happens to be a quantity of 2 Web3 search projects raising money at the same time, than the wise investor must divide the investment amount of X / 2 and invest equally in both projects.

That’s fantastic! I love what you’re doing for Web3 search on the IC!

Im curious, does every query made (as well as indexing and crawlers) require cycles? How is that managed? I imagine the cycle cost would be pretty high?
