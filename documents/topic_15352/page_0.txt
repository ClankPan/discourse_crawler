**Proposal:** Convert from a system-based rewards model to a voter-based reward model.

The current system determines a reward rate, total supply, and then determines the total reward to give each day by multiplying the (reward rate * the total_supply)/day. The total rewards are then handed out based on each neuron’s share of the total voting weight for the day.

The new system will determine the reward rate and multiply the rate by the weighted vote-completion percentage and bonus rate of each voting neuron.

A result of this proposal will be the reduction in total inflation of ICP due to the fact that some voters do not vote on all proposals or follow a voter for all proposals. The following illustration shows the handing out of rewards in the old vs new system.

![NNS drawing Voting rewards](upload://zXL9iWiN6oBYMGFHvOABsH2dBnJ)

Spam is neutralized because additional proposals will not affect the ability of a neuron to gain rewards. Any neuron’s maximum reward for the day is generated by Reward Rate *(Actual Vote Weight/Possible Vote Weight) * Age Bonus. Adding extra, superfluous heavy weighted votes only increases the Possible Vote denominator and thus does not increase the number of rewards handed out in a day.

Weights can remain in the calculations to encourage participation due to the fact that each voter is only competing against themselves to achieve 100% voting for the day.

This scheme can be easily implemented in the existing code by manipulating the distribute_rewards function to iterate over all considered_proposals, finding the weight of each proposal and creating a target sum. Instead of creating a map of voters_to_used_voting_rights, the map will also need to keep track of each vote’s absolute weight. The reward function on [ic/governance.rs at 73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5 · dfinity/ic · GitHub ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6059) will need to be adjusted to be used_voting_rights * (total absolute vote weight/target vote weight). The used_voting_rights has the age and lock bonuses built in. (Note - The reward function is mapping twice as much data, so performance may be an issue here).

A worked example:

4 proposals are eligible for rewards on a day. The reward rate is 15%.

Proposal 1 - XDR Exchange Rate - Weight 0.01

Proposal 2 - Subnet management - Weight 1

Proposal 3 - Node Rewards - Weight 1

Proposal 4 - Governance Proposal - Weight 20

Total Possible Vote weight: 22.01.

Voter 1 - Passive whale votes with 10,000 voting reward on proposals 1-3. Total executed weight is 2.01. Thus the reward is 10,000 * (.15/365) *(2.01/22.01 = 0.3752 ICP(~1.3%)

Voter 2 - Active holder votes with 100 voting reward on proposals 1-4. Total executed weight is 22.01. Thus the reward is 100 * (.15/365) *(22.01/22.01 = 0.041 ICP (~15%)

**Why Now?**

The new exchange rate mechanism(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/28) will make spam much more attractive.  We need a quick fix and this is the quickest route to implementation.

A few more notes from the discussion with the community/foundation(h/t to @bjoernek for compiling):

* Proposal: The reward mechanism assumes that everybody votes on all proposals. If you vote on all proposals you get rewards corresponding to your share of voting power compared to the total voting power. You get reduced rewards if you miss votes, but those lost rewards don’t go to active voters.
* Impact on total rewards/inflation: This proposal reduces the rewards which are allocated on a daily basis, depending on how many participants miss votes. This reduces inflation. In a second stage (out of scope of this proposal) we could consider allocating these un-distributed rewards to an NNS treasury.
* Impact on financial incentives: This proposal removes the direct financial incentive to submit spam proposals, i.e., active votes will not gain additional rewards in case of spam proposals. However there is still an indirect financial incentive as the new mechanism reduces the inflation; this creates a benefit for ICP holders (staked/unstaked)
* Impact on reward weights: As this proposal removes the direct financial incentive for spam we could consider to reset the reward weight for governance proposals back to 20.
* Implementation effort: This proposal requires only an update of a few lines of code within the function distribute_rewards in governance.rs. Thus this can be implemented relatively quickly.
* Why bring up this proposal now again?
  * In connection with the new exchange rate mechanism we require a quick solution.
  * Earlier concerns on the ability to influence the inflation rate (and thus also reduce the predictability of total supply) are much less of an issue now, given that maturity modulation included anyway further uncertainty on this.
* Connection to periodic confirmation of following: We already have an approved motion proposal for spam prevention namely periodic confirmation of followees. However, this still requires some enhancements wrt to the handling of time-sensitive proposals (for which a few ideas are under discussion). Periodic confirmation of followees could still be valuable, even if this proposal is implemented because it strengthens active voting participation.

*Personal note:* I think putting the inflation into an NNS treasure is a great idea.  This gives orgs like ICDevs a place to go to seek funds for specific projects that need to be built and hands control of those decisions to the NNS without as much work required by the foundation.  This proposal is a step one toward doing that as it gives us an obvious chunk of value to use. It is also a win/win for the passive staker that may miss votes as the funds are still used for the benefit of the community and could, in theory, a much higher financial impact than liquidating them today. It is hard to find win/win scenarios, but we have one here.

I plan on submitting this to the NNS after seven days of discussion(unless we find significant issues).

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-09 17:26:48 UTC | #3

I'm torn on this proposal.  I'll offer some thoughts, but haven't decided yet how I would vote...

1. I think removal of exchange rate proposals may not have that big of an effect on spam.  Sure there is more incentive as @bjoernek [described](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/29), but I'm not sure it will actually result in spam for the purpose of financial gain.  The incentive for spam is still much lower than it was when Governance proposal weights were 20x.  Two easy disincentives for spam include increases in proposal reject fees as well as people continuing to submit Register Known Neuron proposals (since they are legit Governance proposals).  I provided additional feedback in [this comment](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/30).
2. I'm much more concerned about what happens when there are no proposals.  The Exchange Rate proposal is the only reason we have been guaranteed voting rewards every day.  I don't currently know if the NNS already takes care of this in some way or if a new policy needs to be implemented if there are no proposals.
3. The white box in your chart is a lot smaller today since Governance proposal weight is only 1x and there are very few Governance proposals.  Hence, if this proposal does move forward, I would argue that the Governance proposal weight should revert back to 20x at the same time.  The size of the white box would then be closer to accurate.  I want there to be an increased incentive for active participation in governance like there was with the Governance proposal weight was higher, which will only occur if people are losing voting rewards by not voting.  I fully agree that this proposal is a disincentive for spam, which means an increase of Governance proposal weight will not re-incentivize spam.
4. I don't believe we have an inflation problem and I don't like the idea of burning voting rewards.  I would rather they be redistributed to active participants in governance as they are today compared to burning voting rewards.  However, I think building an NNS treasury (or whatever it should be called) is a very productive use of those voting rewards.  I can envision many use cases, all of which needs a lot more discussion.  For example, those rewards could be used to incentivize experts, incentivize named neurons, fund community driven proposals AND community driven implementation, fund R&D on the effectiveness of tokenomics as well as how to decentralize the IC, fund code bounties that are specifically related to governance and progress toward decentralization, fund new organizations so DFINITY is not the only major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain, etc.  I would rather see unclaimed voting rewards (from not voting) dedicated for this purpose instead of being redistributed to active participants in governance.  I see this as a better use of these funds for the long term best interest of the IC and in line with the tokenomics purpose of incentivizing governance participation.
5. I also agree this proposal is complimentary to periodic confirmation of followees, which I would still like to see implemented in due time.

kvic | 2022-09-09 19:03:20 UTC | #5

I would like to propose a different approach that is passive but brings the rewards to those who are more active.

What if each proposal is active for 3 days so I can have a life and not have to login to the NNS every 2 hours but maybe daily and be able to vote on all proposals and not have to rush through these proposals and get to have the time to vote before time runs out.

Maybe then we will see that many neuron holders will reject spam as they will have the time to realize that a proposal is spam not as it is at the moment all spam is approved.

I notice that there are reject votes for the network upgrades this morning but why.

Just to repeat myself to be clear about why I think the NNS fails.

Everyday I feel I have to login to the NNS every couple of hours and if I see active proposals then I rush to vote before they disappear from my screen.

This I believe will reward those who are active and then those who follow have reduced rewards for following.

My reason for investing on the NNS is to receive rewards and NOT fund programmers and their projects. Over the years the funds that were invested early and bought ICP cheap is their reward and programmers and their projects have been given billions already.

So to be clear I say no to giving rewards to projects.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-09 19:05:45 UTC | #6

Agreed with every point, especially the second. Rewards from days with no proposals should be compounded and distributed eventually.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-09 19:14:36 UTC | #7

You don't need to do that.  The governance proposals that you need to follow are already 4 days long. For the others you can just follow DFINITY for...unless you're wanting to reject them...then yeah...you have to be quick.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-09-09 19:14:48 UTC | #8

Just to iterate from my side: I think this proposal would be a very practical & good solution (for the reasons outlined above) and thus I am supportive.

I have provided further details in the forum post which you linked. In particular for week-ends we would end up on a similar level of incentives (comparing gov weights=20 and exchange rate proposals vs gov weights=1 and no exchange rate proposals).

Functionality for this case is already implemented in the NNS. The reward pot on days without voting would be carried over to the following day.

Agreed. Aligned with the comment by @skilesare, we should consider increasing the reward weight for governance proposals. I would be in favour of that.

[/quote]
Yes, I also agree on that point. We should definitely consider establishing a NNS treasury, to which we could allocate for example the undistributed rewards. Given that this requires some discussion & design, this could be done in a second step. 
In the meantime, we could track how much of the reward pot is not distributed. 
[quote] 
* I also agree this proposal is complimentary to periodic confirmation of followees, which I would still like to see implemented in due time.

Yes, probably the focus of periodic confirmation would shift. Instead of spam prevention it would be more about regular participation in governance.

Anything that does this directly will incentivize spam.  Anything that does it indirectly by addition may. This proposal benefits indirectly, but by subtraction(inflation) and even that could incentivize spam a bit...for the really patient.

wpb | 2022-09-09 20:29:59 UTC | #10

This is really good feedback.  Thank you on all points!

I do see the issue with potential for spam on weekends.  If there are no exchange rate proposals, no routine business proposals (e.g. subnet updates), and no register known neuron proposals, then there is likely an incentive for 1 spam proposal.  TBH I think people will catch on pretty quickly that weekends are the time to submit register known neuron proposals, which will make it pointless to spam.  I’d even offer to make the register known neuron proposals for anyone who wants to pursue it so we lower the barrier to entry on submitting that proposal.  😁

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-09-09 21:10:29 UTC | #11

@skilesare if I understand this correctly, with your proposal someone who votes by following receives less rewards than someone who votes manually.

Please could you confirm that?

If so, I think this has implications for named neurons.

For example, I have a named neuron that I only set up recently and only staked the reject cost of 10 ICP. I have a much older personal neuron with more staked which follows that so I only need to vote using the named neuron.

With your proposed changes, I think I would need to vote with my personal neuron in order to maximize rewards. In my case I could easily swap things around so that the newer named neuron follows the older personal neuron, and I vote with my personal neuron instead.

I’ve heard @Kyle_Langham say publicly that they do what I currently do, and that’s what inspired me to set things up the way I did.

However, the neuron they vote with is followed by ICPMN so if they wanted to swap things around then the ICPMN neuron would need to start following that instead.

Maybe making that change isn’t a big deal but I think people should at least be made aware of this otherwise they’d still be voting manually and not getting the appropriate rewards.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-09 22:05:13 UTC | #12

I don’t interpret anything in @skilesare proposal that differentiates voting rewards between voting manually vs vote following.  The only distinction is voting or not voting.  If you vote on every proposal, no matter how your vote gets executed, you still maximize voting rewards.

Also for public named neurons, it doesn’t matter if you vote with your main private neuron that is followed by your public neuron or vice versa.  Another method is to use hotkeys and cast both votes at the same time.  Regardless, the only reason to create a new neuron to use as a public neuron is to prevent someone from linking it publicly to your main private neuron by tracing ledger transactions and stake amounts.  This is best accomplished by funding your public neuron through an exchange (or Spinner Cash would work as well).

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-09-09 22:11:33 UTC | #13

I think this points to a common misconception and I wonder if it's because people view following a neuron as "passive".

But it's really the non-participants who don't vote manual or follow a neuron on governance proposals that everyone is suggesting should get less rewards because their neuron is not voting at all on those proposals.

Maybe there’s a better term we all can use to define those who are not voting to replace “passive”?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-09 22:21:11 UTC | #17

I was about to ask you what terminology caused you to think it was about voting manually vs vote following.  Thanks for sharing.  I think @skileshare should clarify that language to avoid confusion.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-11 10:45:09 UTC | #18

@skilesare  
As it stands now, I think I would reject this proposal since it is currently scoped to reduce inflation by burning voting rewards.  However, I think the proposal has a lot of potential if you give it some important tweaks.  Hence, I propose that you modify your proposal in a few ways:

1) remove language that uses inflation reduction as a driver
2) add the concept of tracking undistributed maturity so it can be used in the future in ways that benefit governance and decentralization of the internet computer
3) add that the Governance proposal weight will be immediately reverted back to 20x upon implementation of your proposal
4) deleted as explained [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/27?u=wpb)
5) add the clarification needed to address concerns expressed by @paulyoung 

Of course, this is your proposal and your decision if and how to modify the proposal.  I’m just offering my two cents on what I think would most benefit the IC ecosystem and increase the probability of passing.  I appreciate you giving consideration to these proposed modifications.

That is 100% not the case. By “passive whale” I meant whales that have not bothered to follow someone  other than dfinity for governance. I’ll clarify. I consider delegating one’s vote to someone  more qualified the true power behind liquid democracy.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-10 01:15:45 UTC | #20

I agree with all of this *in principal* but I’m not sure if we can/should do all of that at one time *in practice *.

1.An NNS team member should tell us if any of those need to be separate to enact an on chain effect.
2. Adding anything about tracking burned tokens will complicate the code changes and delay the implementation. I think I’d rather use the reduction to light a fire behind the community to find a solution. To me it would seem that the worst that could happen is a reduction in sell pressure while we figure out what to do.  But I’m open to other arguments or pull request that simplify the tracking.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-10 02:08:33 UTC | #21

It might require a further clarification since there is a little more nuance.  All neurons were originally configured to follow DFINITY for the All Topics catch all category.  No neuron was originally configured to follow anyone for the Governance topic directly.  Since the Governance topic was removed from the All Topics catch all, the neurons that receive voting rewards for Governance proposals are neurons that vote manually or have been configured to follow someone else for the Governance topic.  Hence, your reference to passive whales really means any neuron that is still following only DFINITY for the All Topics Except Governance catch all category.  Any neuron that is following DFINITY for Governance is active and voting.

[quote="wpb, post:21, topic:15352"]

[/quote]

If we *could* clarify this, I personally would appreciate it. Right now I am following DFINITY for all *except* governance because I am not familiar with the higher level knowledge (yet) to be able to determine if the code is malicious. Thus, I appreciated the ability to follow DFINTY for this reason. Now, if the way I have it setup does not make me "passive", I would prefer to keep it this way, or perhaps I will follow @paulyoung or others with the higher level knowledge so *if* somehow someone does try to shoot through malicious code *My vote* will be to block it. *Not* allow it. 

I do want to point out though, I also want to maximize my rewards and would appreciate the overall clarification on what the ramifications would be for any of these implementations. 

Or, if you want to be direct you *could* just tell me the best way to vote and increase decentralization, yet, not blindly vote on code for reasons I mentioned.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-11 03:29:30 UTC | #23

Following DFINITY for All Topics Except Governance is an excellent choice.

Maximizing voting rewards today means you also have to be following a neuron you trust to always vote on Governance topics.  There are now many options.  DFINITY is a good choice because they vote on almost all Governance proposals.  The same is true for other names neurons.  Just make sure you set up your neuron with a Followee for the Governance topic.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-11 03:54:43 UTC | #24

This is excellent feedback for where I am. Sorry if I diverted the topic. 

I was mainly focusing on this proposal though. If it was implemented would my current situation "follow DFINTY for all topics except governance" consider me "passive"? I do want to reserve the right to vote  for governance proposals as they arise. However, as mentioned I want to still say "yes" on healthy updates, and "no" on anything that may ever be malicious. Does that make more sense?

-------------------------

DavidB | 2022-09-11 09:22:34 UTC | #25

This looks like a well thought out fix to the current situation. I agree with @wpb regarding the additions. Esp. the 20x Governance proposal weight. Creating a treasury for the outlined reasons is also a good idea. I was never a fan of "burning" and rather think putting resources to a use via ecosystem funding etc. is a way bigger value driver.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-09-11 10:35:33 UTC | #26

Regarding the follow-up questions

1. Tracking of un-allocated voting rewards:  I agree that this would a sensible addition to the proposal and I will check with the dashboard team next week on their thoughts & potential effort. Aligned with @skilesare's point, I think this could also be implemented slightly later, i.e., I do not see a hard dependency. 
2. Governance weights to 20: This also makes sense to me. I think this could be part of the motion proposal but the implementation could come slightly later. (The effort is not be big but requires as usual some sanity checks & testing). 
3. Rejection fee back to 1 ICP: I assume that this is obsolete given the latest developments discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-mitigate-nns-advertisement-spam-a-temporary-solution/15360/31).

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-11 11:59:30 UTC | #27

@skilesare 
I agree with @bjoernek [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/26?u=wpb)

My point number 4 [above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352/18?u=wpb) should be deleted since this proposal does not eliminate the potential for spam for the purpose of advertisement.

Also, I see this proposal as a framework for a path forward, not the final solution that will be implemented as written.  Hence, I would rather see some of these key elements incorporated into the proposal now even if implementation comes in stages.  I don’t see a need for a rushed implementation of this proposal, especially when an increased proposal reject fee is a quicker and easier temporary solution to any increased risk of weekend spam when exchange rate proposals are removed from the NNS.

To me, this proposal is a very good way to build an NNS treasury that can fund a lot of efforts that drive governance participation and decentralization.  I think this proposal and periodic confirmation of followees are two solutions to the spam problem (for financial gain) that each have a higher value use case beyond spam prevention.  Hence, it’s not critical to sell this proposal as a spam prevention mechanism.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-11 12:19:17 UTC | #28

I’m in line with all of this…I’ll put together some
More formal text on Monday and post it here for discussion.

As far as non-incentive based spam spam, I still think that https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206/2 is the fastest path forward.

This is an elegant proposal which I heartily support. An independent, NNS controlled treasury is a great idea, for the reason @skilesare has mentioned and also as a possible source of funding for experts voting through the community neurons proposed by @lastmjs .

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-12 18:00:12 UTC | #31

Updated Proposal Text - Please let me know if you think there should be any more changes:

**Proposal:** Convert from a system-based rewards model to a voter-based reward model.

The current system determines a reward rate, total supply, and then determines the total reward to give each day by multiplying the (reward rate * the total_supply)/day. The total rewards are then handed out based on each neuron’s share of the total voting weight for the day.

The new system will determine the reward rate and multiply the rate by the weighted vote-completion percentage and bonus rate of each voting neuron.  

This will also allow us to move the governance weight back to 20 without incetivising spame. We propose this occur as part of this proposal.

A result of this proposal will be a reduction in total minted ICP due to the fact that some voters do not vote on all proposals or follow a voter for all proposals. In a follow-on proposal, the NNS can determine what to do with that "abandoned" ICP.  We suggest an NNS treasury but will leave it to a future proposal to finalize that.   The following illustration shows the handing out of rewards in the old vs new system.

NOTE: "Passive" here means someone who has not elected to follow anyone on the governance proposal topic and who does not manually vote.  We do not consider people that pro-actively follow experts to be passive and appreciate the time and effort they take to find qualified voters.

![NNS drawing Voting rewards](upload://zXL9iWiN6oBYMGFHvOABsH2dBnJ)

Spam is neutralized because additional proposals will not affect the ability of a neuron to gain rewards. Any neuron’s maximum reward for the day is generated by Reward Rate *(Actual Vote Weight/Possible Vote Weight) * Age Bonus. Adding extra, superfluous heavy weighted votes only increases the Possible Vote denominator and thus does not increase the number of rewards handed out in a day.

Weights can remain in the calculations to encourage participation due to the fact that each voter is only competing against themselves to achieve 100% voting for the day.

This scheme can be easily implemented in the existing code by manipulating the distribute_rewards function to iterate over all considered_proposals, finding the weight of each proposal and creating a target sum. Instead of creating a map of voters_to_used_voting_rights, the map will also need to keep track of each vote’s absolute weight. The reward function on [ic/governance.rs at 73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5 · dfinity/ic · GitHub ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6059)will need to be adjusted to be used_voting_rights * (total absolute vote weight/target vote weight). The used_voting_rights has the age and lock bonuses built in. (Note - The reward function is mapping twice as much data, so performance may be an issue here).

A worked example:

4 proposals are eligible for rewards on a day. The reward rate is 15%.

Proposal 1 - XDR Exchange Rate - Weight 0.01

Proposal 2 - Subnet management - Weight 1

Proposal 3 - Node Rewards - Weight 1

Proposal 4 - Governance Proposal - Weight 20

Total Possible Vote weight: 22.01.

Voter 1 - Passive whale votes with 10,000 voting reward on proposals 1-3. Total executed weight is 2.01. Thus the reward is 10,000 * (.15/365) *(2.01/22.01 = 0.3752 ICP(~1.3%)

Voter 2 - Active holder votes with 100 voting reward on proposals 1-4. Total executed weight is 22.01. Thus the reward is 100 * (.15/365) *(22.01/22.01 = 0.041 ICP (~15%)

**Why Now?**

The new exchange rate mechanism([New Exchange Rate Mechanism - #28 by THLO ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/28)) will make spam much more attractive. We need a quick fix and this is the quickest route to implementation.

A few more notes from the discussion with the community/foundation(h/t to @bjoernek for compiling):

* Proposal: The reward mechanism assumes that everybody votes on all proposals. If you vote on all proposals you get rewards corresponding to your share of voting power compared to the total voting power. You get reduced rewards if you miss votes, but those lost rewards don’t go to active voters.
* Impact on total rewards/inflation: This proposal reduces the rewards which are allocated on a daily basis, depending on how many participants miss votes. This reduces inflation. In a second stage (out of scope of this proposal) we could consider allocating these un-distributed rewards to an NNS treasury.
* Impact on financial incentives: This proposal removes the direct financial incentive to submit spam proposals, i.e., active votes will not gain additional rewards in case of spam proposals. However there is still an indirect financial incentive as the new mechanism reduces the inflation; this creates a benefit for ICP holders (staked/unstaked)
* Impact on reward weights: As this proposal removes the direct financial incentive for spam we could consider to reset the reward weight for governance proposals back to 20.
* Implementation effort: This proposal requires only an update of a few lines of code within the function distribute_rewards in governance.rs. Thus this can be implemented relatively quickly.
* Why bring up this proposal now again?
  * In connection with the new exchange rate mechanism we require a quick solution.
  * Earlier concerns on the ability to influence the inflation rate (and thus also reduce the predictability of total supply) are much less of an issue now, given that maturity modulation included anyway further uncertainty on this.
* Connection to periodic confirmation of following: We already have an approved motion proposal for spam prevention namely periodic confirmation of followees. However, this still requires some enhancements wrt to the handling of time-sensitive proposals (for which a few ideas are under discussion). Periodic confirmation of followees could still be valuable, even if this proposal is implemented because it strengthens active voting participation.

Vote Accept to:

1. Convert from system-based rewards to voter-based rewards
2. Change the weight of governance proposals back to 20.
3. Keep track of "abandoned" ICP as a governance-tracked variable.

I know it's technically not a part of this proposal but there should also be a note on implementing a system to track lost rewards from days with no proposals, I'm fine with not getting an higher APY especially if those tokens go in some kind of treasury, but getting a lower APY  than the one displayed on the dashboard cause there are days without proposals kinda suck.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-12 18:18:53 UTC | #33

Someone already noted that rewards roll to the next day so there should not be any lost rewards due to no proposals.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-12 18:23:29 UTC | #34

Oh ok that's news to me, last time I talked to bjoernek about it I was under the impression that wasn't the case

Functionality for this case is already implemented in the NNS. The reward pot on days without voting would be carried over to the following day.

dfisher | 2022-09-12 18:54:53 UTC | #36

I think this is a fantastic idea and kills many birds with one stone. 

1. It reduces the incentive for spam
2. It increases the incentive for governance participation 
3. It reduces inflation 
4. It tees up the grounds for a NNS treasury proposal as we are will be tracking undisbursed maturity from non-voters

I think number 4) the NNS treasury proposal which is out of scope for this proposal should come swiftly after this proposal is approved. I believe the NNS treasury could be the biggest game changer for the future of ICP. 

@skilesare at current rates do you have a way of doing a quick and dirty back of the envelope calculation as to how much undisbursed maturity could be generated at today's rates (from non-governance voters) over the course of the next year and next couple years? If total market cap is $3.4BN and inflation is roughly 10% today, total maturity is $340M. If no-one voted, that is the theoretical annual limit for the NNS treasury at today's prices. I am not sure what % votes but either way the NNS treasury could get absolutely enormous extremely quickly presenting us with incredible opportunities for decentralization. 

Imagine if we had sister foundations popping up globally to support the future of ICP in every which way imaginable. It is truly amazing to consider the possibilities that a NNS treasury could create. Dfinity could have guaranteed funding. We could have multiple contributors to the replica code and multiple parties turning ICP into the future of the internet. There is simply no other blockchain that has anything like it. Money makes the world go around and ICP is too complicated to rely exclusively on Dfinity. 

Over and above the stated benefits, an NNS treasury funded from undisbursed maturity of non-voters would not negatively impact voters. No one would cry out against taxation because it would be easy to not be taxed by participating in governance.

@skilesare @wpb if you'd like to discuss the NNS treasury idea offline I'd love to get your thoughts on it. All that said above, the idea of hundreds of millions floating around in a NNS treasury does strike me as risky too and rife with potentials for abuse and scams. So I agree it should be its own proposal that is properly considered rather than lumped in with this one.

Please reach out.  I think @Kyle_Langham said there would be almost 250,000 ICP a day that was not distributed....but I'll let him confirm because that seems absurdly high and I may be misremembering.  

I've mentioned elsewhere...and I have no expectation of anything like this happening...but as a real example I'll state that about a week and a half of that going into an #8yeargang neuron benefiting ICDevs would permanently endow almost all of what I wanted to do with the organization.  So I think you're right and there are a ton of things we can do all across the landscape with those funds.  One caveat is that we don't want it to go on forever...ultimately full participation and decentralization is the goal.

[/quote]

Based on the analysis on which Kyle & me worked on, it is currently approx 250k of maturity per week which would not be allocated. This analysis is using the same assumptions as the spam analysis [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543/29), i.e., assuming on average approx 0.5 governance and 6 non-governance proposal per day (in addition to 144 exchange rate proposals).

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-09-12 20:30:53 UTC | #39

Thanks. 250,000 ICP per week at $7 per ICP is close to $2M a week (with a little bit of rounding up). $2M a week = $100M a year. Now that's a pretty penny. And we all hope to revisit a world soon in the next 5 years of a $100+ ICP token.

And that's just one year. We could easily have a treasury of over a billion dollars. That's a big opportunity and a big responsibility. The community can discuss it but honestly @bjoernek when talking about those kinds of sums I think Dfinity should really have a heavy hand in thinking through how this should work. 

Now, @Kyle_Langham time for you to confirm the numbers!

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-09-12 20:47:32 UTC | #40

Yup, 250k ICP a week is correct (based on historic data).  @bjoernek did some phenomenal work in running scenarios and compiling data.  His analyses are very strong.

That number will drift lower with each passing week as (a) the inflation rate of ICP decreases and (b) voting participation increases.  So it might be good to move sooner rather than later to ensure the treasury is well funded long term.

Given that an NNS treasury would provide the Internet Computer community options to change the protocol and advertise the IC outside of DFINITY, I would recommend the community have a heady hand in creating the framework of the treasury :slight_smile:

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-09-12 20:53:01 UTC | #41

That's fair. Ok will have a think about how to best deliberate on it. Perhaps a community driven working group makes sense. 

Feels like a big responsibility.

I am all for it to fund projects as long as the project present a credible revenue plan and show it will be profitable at some point.  We need to understand all the treasory, soon as distributed to support a project, will come back on the market and put pressure down on ICP price.  Some project may easily abuse and create themselves good paying jobs without any intention of results.  

We already have community funds for new projects.  I would only not mint any of these extra tokens and reduce inflation.  By increasing ICP price, the community fund create extra value as well.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2022-09-13 06:12:29 UTC | #44

I like the proposal especially the NNS treasury part, It's very important to incentive people involve governance.

People's participation in NNS governance is now suppressed since there is no reward but punishment(currently is 10 ICP, maybe be increased in future).

Based on fairness, the initiating neuron whose NNS proposal is approved should receive reward from the NNS treasury.

Yes, fully agree. Designing and implementing such a treasury would be a big undertaking. As far as this proposal goes and as highlighted by @skilesare the first step would be to track how many voting  rewards  are allocated vs not-allocated.

@bjoernek 
@skilesare 
The proposal looks really promising.

One point here what should be reconsidered:
allocating of un-distributed rewards to an NNS treasury 

The treasure is a possibility of other staker to participate in future products. 

it makes to me more sense if the un-distributed rewards would be burned instead of feeding the inflation "monster"

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-09-15 01:01:33 UTC | #49

Thank you @skilesare and thank you @LightningLad91 ! Appreciate you guys. 

Austin, do you intend on coding this up yourself or do you need to rely on Dfinity to implement it if it is approved? Either way, you have a sense for how complicated it is to implement?

As a non-dev i don’t know the inner workings on actual code changes that are pushed to the NNS. Does Dfinity code up ALL the changes or are some code changes community proposed?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-09-15 01:02:31 UTC | #50

You don’t need to worry about this issue for this proposal. We’ll address the NNS treasury idea at a later date

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-15 01:30:23 UTC | #51

The proposal point to specific code changes and dfinity has advised me that they think the changes are the fastest executable path that has been proposed. It would be phenomenal if a community member belted out a pull request for them, but realistically I think dfinity knows what needs to be done and will tee it up quickly.

If I knew rust better I’d attempt it. I have built this similar functionality in the origyn governance canister which is where I got the idea.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-09-16 12:46:49 UTC | #52

Hi all,
FYI, here is the code change required to implement this proposal (h/t to @johan for providing this). 

Within rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs  and within the function distribute_rewards only the following few lines need to change (in addition there is some work for adjusting several test cases) 

![image|690x404](upload://1bX9irkNfqeec9TVL5EkKfj3Blk.png)

I am not sure if the actual code changes are also discussed in this forum. For this example I found it insightful to share, because it underlines how practical the proposal is.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-16 13:57:13 UTC | #53

What code is necessary to track and allocate unused_voting_right each day in a way that it can be dispensed into an NNS treasury?  I think we should be able to query this information from the governance canister.  I don’t want the governance rewards from unused_voting_right to disappear.  It should be retained so it can be allocated if a NNS treasury is adopted.  

I will do some research later if needed, but there was an account set up where unclaimed ICP from genesis neurons were to be deposited automatically after a period of time.  I think DFINITY passed a governance proposal that enabled this action to be bypassed so genesis neurons had more time to claim, but the idea was important because it would have prevented unclaimed neurons from continuing to receive voting rewards and contributing voting power as a default follower of DFINITY.  I think we should deposit governance rewards from unused_voting_right in a similar way.

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-09-16 21:16:36 UTC | #55

I actually rejected this proposal for selfish reasons.  I actually follow ICP Maximilist for voting but, I actually log on and vote every single day myself and I like that I, theoretically, I get rewarded more than somebody who doesn't vote or votes less.  Even though I voted this way, I am totally open to what the smartest thing for the project actually is.  But, at the same time, I would like to earn the maximum voting rewards possible as an active participator and as an 8yeargang (staked 8 yrs, 8 yr dissolve delay with no plans to ever pressing "start dissolve"), I am in this for the long haul and don't mind that we are inflationary now as, I know that eventually (within the next 2 years more or less...just my guess) as more and more dapps are created and used more and more that we will eventually be deflationary on a major scale.  My thinking anyway. I think i'm right but, again, I am totally open to the smartest thing for the project. I would also be happy with the current proposal if those overflow rewards are used for Advertising the ICP project which would theoretically help in increasing the ICP price, hence, we all benefit from that.

At the current time, you are not rewarded more than someone who doesn't vote. This proposal makes it so that you would be rewarded more.  Perhaps this was unclear in the description....if so, please let me know 1. What made you think you currently get rewarded more than someone who doesn't vote and 2. what made you think this proposal would reward everyone the same.

-------------------------

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-09-16 21:20:10 UTC | #57

I guess I read it wrong.  I thought that any "extra" rewards of non-voters are distributed among the voters and that the proposal aimed to put those rewards aside as opposed to dividing them among the voters?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-16 21:27:39 UTC | #58

That was the case when we had the weight of governance proposals up at 20, but that was reduced to 1 a few weeks ago...this proposal is set up to make it so that we can weigh those governance proposals highly again and give rewards to those that vote 100% of the time.

-------------------------

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-09-16 21:44:25 UTC | #59

Gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-16 21:45:31 UTC | #60

This may be off-topic, however, with @KennyBoyNYC graciously admitting that they read the proposal wrong. I started re-visiting the idea of possibly having a way to uncast/ re-cast your vote within the 3-4 day period governance proposals are open, *if* by chance you misread, or perhaps someone's phone has a screen malfunction and it "freaks out" and selects one for you (this is mainly speaking to phones on the brink).  

Again, I apologize if this diverts the topic. I just felt this was a good example, of an honest mistake, that *could* be fixed/ would be a nice addition.

-------------------------

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-09-16 22:21:06 UTC | #61

Thanks for the notice and kind words and, I agree with your suggestion and would be great if there was a way to change ones vote during the voting period/before the final vote is executed. Im sure its a time consuming task, as most things are, for a programmer to code that update and, i think that thats a great idea and i would vote for it but i think there are more pressing things to spend time on at the moment. Maybe in a year or so but, rethinking it, that would be an important update to make right away as, theoretically,  if a major whale or material amount of people voted in error on something of significance that we should be able to change the vote diring the voting period.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-16 22:30:59 UTC | #62

Yeah, I completely agree. 100% not a *huge* concern of mine. I have been trying to stay up to date on this particular thread, saw your share, and appreciated the honesty because I had this issue with the spam proposal when reducing it back down to 1. Which was a controversial move, I humbly admit as well; that I cast my vote wrong, and wish I could have changed it. I was very new to the procedures of voting and staking. Thankfully, my vote at the time had no significant value. However, down the road if devs. could consider it. Personally, I may outgrow this thought process. Although, there may be someone else unwilling to ask/ speak up when first entering the space, where this *could* be useful to acknowledge while I'm in this phase of my journey. I noticed you quickly enter new phases of education on the IC and as you develop you forget the subtle difficulties you wish were presented more clearly. So, I am only hoping they consider it one day (as you said)

I am of the opinion that having the NNS and Governance Discussions for update to the NNS in-house is not Decentralized, placed within an environment where accountants and programmers are in control where they expect outside investment.

You can't have your cake and eat it.

Which is the environment you have created.

While, within-house, you take away our investment promises of returns, call us names to justify your reasons to remove our rewards.

Clearly, so far, the changes are one side and then there is the spam, awful.

The reason for the many failures and do-overs are due to self interests you put forward which is the same behavior you claim you want rid of.

How is that  spam is supported with donated coins for rejection but then is rewarded by being accepted and the proposals for updates from internal for donation is ignored.

I want to see investors reading this and that agree, to put forward discussion for an update to be moved to a public forum and a true decentralized environment.

coteclaude | 2022-09-18 11:02:13 UTC | #72

It is agreed that the tokenomics is very bad. No one argue this.  Now that we have a chance to reduce the inflation with this proposal and help the price, some want to create a treasury to support projects or whatever.  Eventually, this treasury will be dumped in the market and pressure the price down, again, like it is not pressured enough already.
Many does not seems to get the concept that with less ICP, the price will go up. We already have the community fund for the projects.  A treasury will not help the ecosystem.  It will create jobs where those lucky winners won't have any incentive or motivation for success.
A higher price for ICP and a well controlled CF will be much more beneficial to the entire ecosystem.
More ICP, that will be all for sale at some point, will just make it worst.
Business 101

anonymous | 2022-09-18 11:28:06 UTC | #73

Perhaps the ICP that would have been in treasury should instead be burned? That's more ideal?

-------------------------

Absolutely the best option, for everyone.  Better have less ICP on the market at higher price than more at low price.

romulusp | 2022-09-18 11:59:04 UTC | #75

Treasury, in my opinion is not a bad idea, in the future for sure we will have some emergency and we will need money fast. But we have to keep inflation low, maybe 70% burn and 30% in treasury or something like that.

willguest | 2022-09-18 12:53:25 UTC | #77

Thanks @skilesare for this interesting and straight-forward proposal.

There is a group of people here, who I am assuming are investors in the platform who have "staked" their money in the IC, anticipating a return that was discussed and explained by DFINITY. These folks, particularly those who are not up to date with current developments in the ecosystem, are the ones who will lose if this passes. 

To anticipate or mitigate the negativity of those who lost out just by being in a different social sphere, I think the change should also mandate additional efforts to reach out to them. I must admit to suggesting this without much knowledge of how hard this would be or what is currently being done. Any fallout from bad press based on lost earnings would impact DFINITY and the community, so I think the responsibility falls with both. 

I will be voting 'yes' to this proposal because it adds to the autonomy of the neuron holder. I like that ICP rewards involve participation and this proposal reinforces this point.

The community fund is for projects that can turn a profit, as far as I can tell (else why would anybody stake?). There are many potential projects out there that would improve the network but could not hope to make a profit. Think of the committee neurons suggested by @lastmjs for instance. How would those be funded? One possibility is to create new ICP but that would add to inflation. A second option is to take a bite out of peoples' stakes, but that will also meet with a lot of resistance. A Treasury made up from undisbursed rewards would solve the problem without increasing inflation. 
Inflation is pre-set on a downward trajectory anyway. Centralisation is a far greater long-term problem than inflation, and an NNS controlled treasury could greatly help with decentralisation.

Eventually, this treasury will be dumped in the market and pressure the price down, again, like it is not pressured enough already.

I'd argue investing those tokens in the ecosystem to create new dApps will lead to better results than burning them. A thriving ecosystem will attract more devs and users resulting in more investors and ICP converted to cycles. Burning the tokens to reduce inflation is a very short sighted choice.

coteclaude | 2022-09-18 23:07:25 UTC | #81

There are already VCs and Community fund to support new dApps.  DSCVR have found investors because there is some good potential there.  If an app creator cannot convince a VC or the CF to get financial support, would you use that treasury?
That treasury would never be able to follow up on the dApp.  There will be no control.  This is why I also do not believe in the CF.
But for this discussion, 2 options is more than enough and a third one would be waste of ICP.
Those ICP inflation for rewards 10% to 5% over 8 years were promised to be for NNS voters.  When investors did their DYOR, they used the rewards calculator and the information provided by Dfinity to take the hard decision to lock for 8 years.  After 18 months, some want to change the use of these rewards and use it for Dapps creator?
If you are a Dapp creator and need financial support, and have a good project, well documented with a credible financial plan, you will find investors easily or the CF to come.
A treasury should not be created to supply poor dApps creator, as been the last option for them.

This is a great point. Most of these folks were heavy early investors in dfinity. I would imagine most of them could be contacted…but to be honest, many of these folks are so wealthy that this is not worth their time. The likely have been contacted.  That being said …we need all kinds of efforts to decentralized the votes to experts in the community.

I agree and I’d suggest that this fund be used for things that typically don’t attract vc…ie not for profit dapps.

And what about incentivizing Named neurons?
Will Named neurons be voting to incentivize themselves?
What about named neuron Cryptoisgood who have honestly disclosed that he is a sluggish voting named neuron, does not have much time and will follow other neurons to vote?  Incentivize?
You don't have to apply to be a named neuron.  It should not be a paid job.
By doing this, you will have new named neurons applying only to receive the benefits.
Personally, I use much of my time to read and understand all governance proposals and vote as best as I can.  Should I be incentivize?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-09-19 00:20:13 UTC | #85

I’ve noticed that you do spend a lot of time educating yourself on governance topics and joining the discussions.  Why don’t you create a known neuron?  I don’t see anything wrong with following other neurons if you don’t feel the need to vote manually on a given proposal.  Hence it doesn’t have to be a burden if you register as an individual.  You always have an interesting perspective to share and I’m sure there are people out there who would want to follow you if you make yourself known and tell people how you plan to vote.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-19 01:32:36 UTC | #86

Will be very honest with you here, as always.  I don't apply to be a known neuron because I think there is only 1 person that control everything, despite all the voting.  I am a good investor who have lost confidence overtime.  I have a lot of confidence and trust about all the Dfinity programmers and all employees.  But none anymore about the management overthere.
I started to loose my trust at proposal 48623 because of the reason why this was proposed.  As you know, the engineer, who left Dfinity since, have admited that he made the proposals while being against it and did not believe in it.  Many people have voted YES because of the credibility and influence of this engineer.  I am not blaming the engineer.  He had to follow orders of his employer.  So, how can we trust Dfinity management now?
This proposal was near a 50-50 voting.  A lot of ressource and effort is spent to programmed this complicated system... to avoid taxes for a limited number of individuals,  not to benefit the network at all. This is against their own guideline for proposals. 

Then a great proposal at 90% passed about regularly confirming your following is ignored with some strange excuses.  Now we have dead and inactive accounts that keep following Dfinity in their votes.  I can only suspect they don't want to loose these followers so they retain more power.  There is no other good explanation for this.  And you know this as well.
So I know that at the end, votes don't count much.
So I am following close the governance in hope for change but right now, I see it as a 1 man centralization.  Voting is quiet irrelevant TMO.  
When I feel Dfinity will respect the voting and feel all initiators of a proposal really believe in what they propose and not being forced by the management, I may apply.

EDIT to add:  Go on glassdoor.com and look for Dfinity.  Some very interesting comments from actual and ex employees that tells you a lot about how it goes overthere.  It support my post here.

tsetse | 2022-09-19 05:14:08 UTC | #88

Just to clarify, in case this was a response to my comment, the proposed committee neurons are very different from named neurons. Nobody has or should propose any monetary incentivization of named neurons. At some point, I suspect some named neurons will ask for voluntary donations, but never should they get mandated ones.
Committee neurons will be composed of experts who will actually examine and tweak the IC's code, something that current only Dfinity does. Nor does Dfinity have any plan, at least any they have made public, to reduce their grip on this core aspect of the IC's functioning. But no expert would do this very arduous and important job without adequate compensation. Since there is no profit involved, a treasury would serve much better than the community fund to sponsor the effort.
An additional point about the usefulness of a treasury: we the community have no information about what Dfinity's funding looks like. Maybe even most Dfinity staff are ignorant of it, it is possible only a tiny group knows the exact financial situation. Unlike, say, the Ethereum Foundation which provides precise data on its fiat and crypto holdings, Dfinity is almost entirely opaque. We just have to trust them to fulfill their responsibilities. But what if they don't? What if Dfinity runs out of money before network effects take hold to a sufficient degree? Would it not be good to have a back-up source of funding independent of Dfinity, created without increasing aggregate inflation?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-09-19 05:39:25 UTC | #89

I clearly understand and agree on many of your statement.  But the reality may be much different.  Dfinity, with their voting power and the voting of all insiders can approve about everything.  The hiding of their financials are also very scary.  I agree with you 100%.
As per 8 yeargangDAO, their stance on the treasury for named neurons seems different from what you are saying.  see attached:

Blockchains are meant to be trustless distributed systems.. We have clowns for governance, it was bound to happen, sooner the better.


NNS governance is centralized, and decisions happen in closed rooms. Some of the named neurons and proposers are the biggest abusers of NNS

these scenarios thinking comes from wpb, Currently, the governance participation is very low, most of people don't care at all. We think it's a good way to encourage community participation in governance.

We need mechanism to incentive participation, ONLY PASSION IS NOT ENOUGH.

[quote="wpb, post:3, topic:15352"]
For example, those rewards could be used to incentivize experts, incentivize named neurons, fund community driven proposals AND community driven implementation, fund R&D on the effectiveness of tokenomics as well as how to decentralize the IC, fund code bounties that are specifically related to governance and progress toward decentralization, fund new organizations so DFINITY is not the only major contributor to the Internet Computer blockchain, etc.

It is not easy to reach decentralization, but I think we are on the right track, Dfinity and IC have the potential to achieve it, if it wants to survive..it will release power as the ecosystem grows, transparency will be basic, there are very intelligent people with a sharpened mind and open eyes like you, denouncing to the community all this things, this is part of the process.

Looks like a Chicken and Egg problem. No one will be incentivized to participate in governance that is shady, centralized, and purely based on Liquid Democracy.


Builders don't even have an incentive to participate in the NNS. The only incentive for many right now is to survive on IC, like prisoners.

But do you see light at the end of the tunnel?  Do you think we will achieve decentralization?

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-09-19 11:02:29 UTC | #98

Yes of course. That is the point of IC, to decentralize the Internet and provide a platform for anyone to build software as smart contracts.


But right now, we are witnessing and using centralized canister smart contracts, which lack documentation, and are not tokenized or immutable. The only way to make them sustainable would be to govern them with tokenized turn-key DAOs.

However, DAOs, like any other organization, can get too political and shady ( like governments ), because, in the end, those with the highest IC staked could do whatever they want to the protocol using NNS.


Since there was no token standard when the mainnet launched, almost every dapp built its own token standard for NFTs or DeFi. This gave rise to siloed centralized launchpads and infra protocols - controlled and owned by centralized entities. That's also why there is so much unhealthy competition for first mover advantage.


In the end, open-source software will take over IC because anyone can contribute and build on open-source platforms leveraging token incentives. It only goes to prove that tokenization is a very important part of decentralization. IC's NNS has already made several tokenomics modifications, of which many were blatantly exploited by the very own people that stake for 8 years.


*Open Evolving Protocols > Proprietary Closed Protocols.*


Because, more transparency and opportunities fuel ***decentralization***. Instead of Creating barriers for gatekeeping NNS, IC should create more opportunities and onboarding incentives.


My take: Apple's proprietary product took off because of greater security and better user experience with their devices.


#ICP is already superior to other blockchains for building and hosting internet-scale autonomous composable smart contracts as software. We have not seen a true web3 UI yet, but onboarding might require a more familiar and friendly web2 UI in the beginning.

I'm not sure where this is coming from.  If my history is not misremembered these folks were the first movers and were trying to do something cool with the NNS.  They put a lot of thought into what they were trying to do and created a place where people who cared a lot about governance could have a meaningful voice.  We need more of that, not less.

Are all the proposals coming out of that group optimized and perfect? Of Course not.  But they've certainly contributed to the conversation and pushed things forward.  Is there some specific thing that happened that made you feel that they were 'morally corrupt'? That is a very brash claim to make of someone.

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-09-19 12:45:34 UTC | #100

Following this topic can be pretty demoralising. While the tech behind the ic protocol is extremely important, it seems like that wouldn't matter without a well working governance system. And apparently having a well working governance system is a tough nut to crack. I guess it's hard to reconcile the fact that some hold a lot of voting power, while others don't. Have there been any thoughts about having diminishing voting returns the more icp one holds?

The committee neuron idea seems favorable to me. Besides that, the comments here seem to be bogged down with a lot of understandable frustration. One would think creating something as important and as complicated as a healthy governance system warrants some specialist help. Do other blockchains struggle with this question as much as we do?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-09-19 13:41:30 UTC | #101

I support this proposal; i think it strikes a good balance of incentives. 

Regarding the distribution of treasury funds; I would support an effort to compensate a *technical* committee. Members of these committees should be qualified experts that can contribute to protocol development and review upgrade proposals.

However, I would not support the funding of political committees. This is only going to lead to more gatekeepers and will incentivize individuals to become political leaders for the sake of profit rather than because they actually care about the network.

That's just my two cents on the matter.

I am sorry, I missed that. I do not believe named neurons should be incentivised through Treasury grants, but some in the community obviously do. I think it might set a bad precedent and lead to a lot of unnecessary fights. Named neurons are best incentivised through voluntary donations from followers; committee neurons can best be incentivised to Treasury grants.

Indeed. Dfinity did a huge number of great things, very original tokenomics, the reverse gas model, liquid democracy and so on. Brilliant stuff. But the community has by now absorbed those advances and takes them for granted. This is natural in any governance system.
Dfinity also did some badly thought-through things. They sold too much seed round ICP too cheap, and then tried to stop the flood of ICP at launch by making seed neurons difficult to access. Didn't help the price movement at all, because the folks at Dfinity don't appear to understand markets well. Second, they built a system geared towards a long-term perspective by incentivising 8 year neurons, but in doing so created a permanent oligarchy within the system. Whales in other blockchains are different from whales on the IC because other systems offer free selling of tokens, which means the whales keep changing. The top holders of BTC and ETH have changed radically in the past seven years, but seven years down the line, the biggest holders of ICP will be the same that are in place today. This is extremely unhealthy for the system.
Further, and this is something I have not seen discussed enough on the forums and might require a separate post, staking on the IC is completely different from staking of ETH and similar layer 2s. In other Layer 2s, staking is for validation and governance is handled independently of staking. On the IC, staking is for governance and validation is handled independently of staking. Despite staking being for governance, stakers outside Dfinity cannot actually govern because the protocol is entirely in the hands of Dfinity, which takes decisions according to its own roadmap, which in turn is usually determined by one man at its helm. This is the root cause of the community's frustration.
It is too late to do anything about the distribution and lock-ins of neurons, but we should try our best to ensure the community's voice gradually has real teeth, that we are not dependent on Dfinity being a kind and well-meaning dictator. Of course Dfinity is best qualified to work on the core code right now, but five years hence we should not still be dependent on Dfinity. To make sure we are ready, we need an independent source of funding. The Treasury idea is great. And we need independent experts who can very gradually take over some of what Dfinity is taking care of. That is what committee neurons will do. In the long run, Dfinity should not be an organisation with 300 staff but a skeleton grant-giving body run by independent committees governed by the NNS.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-09-19 14:52:53 UTC | #103

The fact there a lot of very smart people here does bring some solace. Thanks for your response. Would you be willing to create a seperate thread about the governance versus validating topic?

Like I wrote earlier, from my layman's perspective the idea of committee neurons seems like a good step forward. I wonder though whether any of the problems being faced are unresolveble. Is this the case or are there enough possibilities to reach a desirable outcome in the nns?
