I am a beginner to dfinity, and I am trying to create my token in my name, and I need a detailed explanation. Can anyone help me?

The rust ledger code is at HTTP://GitHub.vom/dfinity/ic. You could create a canister with that. There are other token proposals elsewhere.

You can use the createToken function provided by ICPEx（[https://icpex.org/createToken](https://icpex.org/createToken)）, which supports both ICRC2 and DIP20 standards. Additionally, they support burn fee and ratio fee functionality.
