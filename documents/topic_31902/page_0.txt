Hello everyone, the 2nd United Nations South Africa hackathon (with option to participate online if you can't make it in person) has been announced with $70,000 in total awards.

As with our previous hackathons ICP is the platform and, like the recent Oxford hackathon, the South Africa hackathon has two tracks. You can compete in either or both (prizes are awarded for both tracks):

**Track 1: AI (Artificial Intelligence)**
**Track 2: DeCom (Decentralized Commerce)**

Details and sign-up are online at the official hackathon page:
