Dear Motoko devs!

Due to a small automation mishap a major version bump (including the fresh `try`/`finally` feature) of `moc` got included in 0.23.0-beta.2 of `dfx`. The final `dfx` 0.23.0 will contain `moc` 0.11.3. We apologise for the oversight.

On the bright side this gives you the opportunity to make your experiences with the new feature and provide feedback. For now we suggest _not to use_ `moc` v0.12.0 _for production_ canisters. This is for an abundance of caution as we have too few pilot users putting the release through its paces.

You can expect the future `dfx` v0.24 to contain the latest and greatest Motoko! Thanks in advance for your understanding.
