I was using the bitcoin api and I noticed the bitcoin txid from the managementcanister.get_uttxos method in the management canister was different than the transaction id of a transaction i signed and sent via managementcanister.send_btc_transaction).

Is there a way to view whether the txid i signed and sent in the latter method went through? I want to keep track of transactions I sent before they get mined so I dont try to send twice on my end and am able to resend if I notice they dont show up in subsequent blocks

oh bruh. I think its flipped in txid vs the signed tx that you get.
