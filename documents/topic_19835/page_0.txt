Hi everyone,
data from [cyql.io](http://cyql.io/) is open! You can get a list of #ic projects and use it in your app. cyql is a curated list of projects that are hosted or are involved in the ic ecosystem. In order to query the projects from db you need to access the [cyql api canister](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=htxcx-3iaaa-aaaal-acd2q-cai) and call one of the methods below, depending on whether you want to get all the projects or one specific project. 

## general canister info

- cyql api canister id: htxcx-3iaaa-aaaal-acd2q-cai
- candid interface: [a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=htxcx-3iaaa-aaaal-acd2q-cai](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=htxcx-3iaaa-aaaal-acd2q-cai)

## query single doc
`get_doc(text, text)`

Method accepts two arguments of type `text`:

1. collection name: `"cyql-projects"`
2. document key (alphanumeric 12 chars string), e.g.: `"QX8lS9ogfjBJ"`

## query all docs

`list_docs(text)`

Method accepts one argument of type `text`:

1. collection name: `"cyql-projects"`
