As the ic grows, and more and more users are expected to make proposals to initiate interactions with daos: non cli users are pushed to use third party hosted (albeit very well executed) platforms to make proposals. This involves hot keying a neuron and depending on the platform or type of proposal some other steps. 

Why is there not a native “make proposal” page within the nns? 
Isnt this the natural logical conclusion of a dao based internet computer?

Hi @Henry_Suso,

Thanks for sharing the idea.

One major item on the NNS team’s roadmap is transitioning the NNS dapp to be a DAO communities portal. Currently, there is limited functionality to get to know the existing communities and contribute to them. The idea to be able to streamline the creation of some proposal has definitely popped up during brainstorming meetings and is on our radar. At the same time, proposals come in different shape and form and we’ll likely look into adding support for the ones that make sense for most of the NNS dapp users.

In general, we try to be conservative on adding new functionality to the NNS dapp. We encourage and welcome the creation of tools from the community as this is a way to avoid centralization. Ultimately, the NNS dapp is just one tool that one can use to stake, earn rewards, and participate in SNS communities.

@Henry_Suso 

this has been DFINITY's official response over the past two years. They seem to have unlimited time, resources and priority when the proposal benefits DFINITY, not the whole community.


This translates to : "NO WE ARE NOT DOING THAT"

@zkcrypto_real 

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

> this has been DFINITY’s official response over the past two years.

Can you please elaborate on this? I admit this is the first time I hear this idea and thus an official response is not how I’d personally put it.

> They seem to have unlimited time, resources and priority when the proposal benefits DFINITY, not the whole community.

I can ensure you that no organization has “unlimited time, resources and priority”, DFINITY not being an exception. Our roadmapping process takes weeks and we take the community’s input very seriously, trying to balance between the short term and the long term needs. Feel free to share your ideas how to improve the user experience in the NNS dapp in a new topic in this forum - we’d love to hear those and discuss.

Thanks for the response: 
As a user of the chain I have to differ.  It’s extremely hard finding where each different dapp has a place to propose. 

Currently Openchat, iclighthouse, proposals.network , and some others

Offer various different ways to propose. 

I think, as dao votes become more integral to even mundane defi actions (ie: getting tokens back from a permissionless list which failed) having a native system for 

Sns treasury transfer

And 

Motion proposal 

Would really help casual users interact with their platforms.

I'm working on something like that with https://toolkit.rem.codes/

After i have it a bit more stable i will do a forum post about out to share the idea behind it and ask for community input.

In the current state you can;
- do SNS upgrade proposals
- (semi) track proposal statussen
- create motion proposals
- create treasury proposals (buggy atm)

some options are only available if you have a neuron assigned.

Thanks for sharing the feedback! 

While DFINITY may have a healthy number of engineers, it's still a relatively small organization compared to web2 companies that often employ 1000+ people. Also, people working in R&D are spread across many different, very important focus areas, like consensus, cryptography, message routing, execution layer, storage layer, network layer, Motoko CDK, boundary nodes, security, research, multi-chain (Chain Fusion), Internet Identity, NNS, NNS dapp, SNS, and more that I'm forgetting.

That said, we do want to make the NNS dapp the best that it can be. Building on @georgi's answer, on our roadmap we have an item that would allow SNS DAO members to initiate upgrading SNS canisters from the NNS dapp, as well as top them up with cycles in order to provide more ways of contributing to SNS DAOs besides directly proposing upgrades to the dapp(s) controlled by the SNS.

Given the fact that this functionality of creating Motion proposals is already available elsewhere, it may not provide as much additional value as some other features we are working on. Let me know if you disagree.

Motion proposal
[/quote]

If you want to submit motion proposals with no code app you can use this

https://proposals.network/

haven't tested it out yet

NNS is fully controlled and developed by **only** DFINITY


You have to get through their bureaucracy and Dominic's lawyer to get anything done.

Yes, I’m very familiar and use this often for dao purposes, it’s why I mentioned it in my post. 

David has done a tremendous amount of work, and so did Isaac with his nns propsoal dapp. I have spent hundreds of pees making foolish and real proposals. 

I just would like to see basic proposal functjons integrated into the nns. 

For active users, interacting with daos is a daily task.
