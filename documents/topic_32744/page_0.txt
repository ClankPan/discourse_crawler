**Greetings to the ICP Community,**

We are excited to introduce the Crato Liquidity Protocol (CLP), a cutting-edge CDP-based liquidity protocol designed specifically for the ICP ecosystem. As the first native stablecoin and liquidity solution within ICP, CLP aims to revolutionize the way we interact with digital assets, providing a secure and efficient platform for asset management and stablecoin issuance.

### About CLP

CLP is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that leverages the capabilities of the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain to offer a robust liquidity protocol. Our main features include:

* **Vaults**: Users can deposit assets such as ICP, ckBTC and ckETH to create Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs).
* **Borrowing**: Users can borrow our native stablecoin, CUSD, against their deposited assets.
* **Liquidation Pools**: These pools ensure the stability of the system by handling the liquidation of undercollateralized CDPs.
* **Future Modules**: Staking and Governance modules are under development to further enhance our ecosystem.

### Latest Progress

The product speaks the best language of communication. After months of rigorous development and testing, CLP has successfully completed its first phase of product development. We have implemented and deployed the main modules, including deposits, withdrawals, lending, and liquidation, in a test environment. The public beta testing phase is now live, and we invite the community to actively participate and provide feedback.

### Current Activities and Airdrop Plan

We are thrilled to announce the public beta testing and airdrop plan for CLP! Here are the highlights:

1. **Community Promotion Airdrop**: Follow our Twitter account, retweet our post, @ three friends, and join our Telegram group. Each week, we will select 10 lucky winners for four weeks.

Only can login with your internet identity? Is it safe to connect to a testnet with your II?

According to official recommendations, we directly deploy products to the main network, and users use test tokens for testing. The testing process will not require you to transfer or authorize. So your assets are safe.
