In the `start_time` field of a SNS.yaml file, is the space between time and UTC optional or mandatory?

In the [example file](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/sns/cli/sns_init_template.yaml) the field is described as:

```
# For fields that represent time of day (such as `start_time`), devs specify
# the value as a string in form "hh::mm UTC". Where hh is hour, and mm is minute.
# Only the UTC timezone is currently supported.
```
But I noticed that in the [SNS.yaml file of WaterNeuron](https://github.com/WaterNeuron/WaterNeuron/blob/main/water_neuron_wtn_sns_init.yaml) there was no space.

```
start_time: 16:00UTC 
```

So just curious if both are supported or not in order to compose an accurate regex. I guess not but, just wanted to double check.

Yes, `start_time` must end with `\s+UTC`, as defined [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nervous_system/humanize/src/lib.rs#L91).

I noticed that the start time in WaterNeuron's SnsInitPayload is [actually](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=130376) `secondsAfterUtcMidnight: 57600` which corresponds to 16 hours. 

Most likely, the SNS.yaml file in their repo is not the one they used to submit the proposal.

Thanks for the confirmation!

Then I should be good, I use following pattern to assert the format.

```
const timeOfDaySchema = z
	.string()
	.refine((time: string): boolean => /^([01]\d|2[0-3]):([0-5]\d) UTC$/.test(time.trim()), {
		message: "Value must be a valid time of day string in the form 'hh:mm UTC'."
	});
```
