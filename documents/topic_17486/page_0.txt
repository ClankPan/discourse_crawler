We almost finished rolling out this release.
We'll make a two-week break in the regular weekly release cadence (that we followed for almost a year now), to reduce risk and to let the release team and the other DFINITY developers rest and enjoy the holidays.
We'll continue after the holidays, so after January 6, 2023.
