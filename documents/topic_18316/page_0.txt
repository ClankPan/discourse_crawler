Hi i am making the frontend on IC.

I have `<a href="/next.html?param=value"></a>`, in my `index.html` page.

My `frontend`'s `src` folder is as follows:
`./index.html`
`./index.js`
`./next.html`
`./next.js`

But i cant go to to `next` because the current url is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=canisterId" and if i go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/next.html?param=value", it will just throw me `400 (Bad request)`.

How should I change between pages on IC? Or can it only handle one-page frontend?

This is a problem only for local development. On mainnet you will be fine. 

Most browsers support the ability to write `<canister id>.localhost:<port>`. Does that work for you?

hi Severin
Yea i can but i have to put my `next.html` and `next.js` under `assets` folder, and treat them like static files. Is this the right way? Because if this is right, does this mean that the user can see my ".js" files?

Also I know this is small problem but how do I route without having to define ".html" file extension?

AFAIK most projects generate the files that will end up in the `assets` folder, maybe after they have been minimised. But @kpeacock can help more with that.

Yes, that's right. But if the files are not visible nobody would be able to use them either.

Starting with dfx 0.12.0, any `/route` is aliased to `/route.html` by default. Is that what you're looking for?

alright got it so the arrangement will be like so:
`src/index.html`
`src/index.js`
these files above get webpacked to `dist` folder.

and 
`asset/logo.svg`
`asset/next.html`
`asset/next.js`
i guess i will stick with this since it's working.

yea i'm looking to do this. Even with the current arrangement like above, i still cant achieve it. I've tried `/next` but it wont get routed to `/next.html` so i have to type in the full file name. My dfx is `0.12.1`. Or do I need to modify some stuffs on the default `webpack.config.js` to get the routing works? 
I will post the screenshots later.

url: `/next.html`
now it got reached

`frontend` folder

the `webpack.config.js` is the default, generated when one `dfx new hello`

Nevermind, I just looked at the commits a bit more close. The aliasing was only added in 0.12.2-beta.0, it landed in the changelog of 0.12.0 through a merge fail.

I would actually recommend you try the latest beta which you can install with 
```
DFX_VERSION="0.13.0-beta.2" sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

Then things should work.

If there's too many breaking changes (there shouldn't be much if anything at all) then using 0.12.2-beta.0 would already include the aliasing as well

Alright is it stable enough for development tho? If not, it's okay, maybe I can do the routing in the future. I will just focus on other things while waiting for 0.12.2

Anyway, have you looked at my file tree? Are the files supposed to be arranged like the screenshot above I posted? (pages that are not homepage, will be placed under `assets` folder)

IMO yes, 0.13.0-beta.2 is stable enough, I haven't heard of any bugs since beta.0. The other beta versions were all added because a feature we want in the next release was not yet included.

I would listen to what @kpeacock says or ask on the discord, but I think this is fine.

Yeah, definitely try out the beta build - route remapping is worth it for your purposes!

I'd also note that you can have the option to nest your content in folders, where

```
/nest
  |  index.html
  |  index.js
```
will route as `"foo.app/nest"` and `"foo.app/nest/index.js"`, depending on your preferences for how you want the files to appear
