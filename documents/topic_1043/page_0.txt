Hello everyone!

`V0.6.3` of the SDK is now available for download :rocket: :partying_face: 

The `0.6.3` release only includes the following minor fixes and enhancements:

* The  `dfx start --clean`  command has been improved to no longer crash if you run the command in a project that is already in a clean state.
Without this fix, manually removing the directories the command is intended to delete would result in  `dfx`  exiting without restarting the Internet Computer.
* The parsing logic for the  `dfx canister call`  command has been improved to more consistently recognize arguments in Candid format and to return better error messages when argument formats are not recognized.
* The Welcome page displayed when you create a new project has been updated to reflect the current location of SDK and Motoko documentation.

As a reminder, you can find more details on our recent releases on the [SDK website](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/sdk-release-notes.html) and in our [`docs` repository](https://github.com/dfinity/docs/tags).

Cheers!
