Hi, lovers of financial geekery!

Working with the Ledger & Tokenization working group was an enriching experience; I learned a lot from our fantastic community. I plan to write a few articles on ledger design and payment flows before I forget everything I learned. I've just published the first introductory article: [Fungible tokens 101](https://mmapped.blog/posts/09-fungible-tokens-101.html).

I hope you'll have at least half as much fun reading the article as I had writing it.
As usual, I'll appreciate your feedback!

P.S. The [Fees](https://mmapped.blog/posts/09-fungible-tokens-101.html#fees) section is my favorite.
