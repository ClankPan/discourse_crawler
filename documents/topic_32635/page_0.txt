Suppose a canister gets stuck by calling method `f()` that calls a method of another canister that never returns. Does it imply that calling `f()` again will be immediately stuck?

I read somewhere that such a stuck in a method canister becomes unupgradeable. Is it true that in addition to having become unupgradeable, its methods (like `f()`) become not callable anymore (stuck)?

Only if you implement some locking mechanism that says that only one call of `f()` can be in progress at a time
