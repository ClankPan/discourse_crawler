Hi,

Wanted to see the magic app with the ic0.app domain and my code but I am missing something. So I followed the steps in the e-mail newsletter today but I faced this error when accessing the url.

Then I spammed the IC with the latest compiled bootstrap.js. However, the error persists. I also tried to change the entrypoint and included originally the assets folder. 

Any other ideas?

When you created/deployed the canisters, dfx would have shown you two canister ids, just double check you‚Äôre using the canister id for the ‚Äúhello_assets‚Äù canister, not the ‚Äúhello‚Äù canister.

Hi Ori,

Thanks for the reply and the tip. However, I tried both canister ids:

```
{
  "hello": {
    "ic": "lkgxr-pmfaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q"
  },
  "hello_assets": {
    "ic": "jvgaw-3umaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-caaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q"
  }
}
```

Are you on the latest version? Run dfx --version and check you‚Äôre running 0.6.12. Also try force refreshing the browser window between attempts (Ctrl F5 or similar), that could help.

hi Ori,

Yes, I tried that and also went to the https url in icognito mode üòéü§ì. I am running 0.6.12 on a Amazon Ubuntu 18.04 instance. The errors seems to stick from worker.js but this makes no sense to me. I even kept the dfx network running in the background. I also tried the phonebook app from the tutorial and got the same error. On linkedup it did not find my OS it seems.

Is there any other motoko library with a frontend that I can try out?

Thanks for walking me through!

No problem. Hmm. You‚Äôre deploying this on the Sodium network without errors, with the --network ic flag? (You also shouldn‚Äôt need to run any network node on your instance for this).

Perhaps @stanley.jones or @hansl may have some thoughts on this too, if they have time today.

Yes. I also would like to write a blog post on [icp.news](https://icp.news) about deploying my first app. It is just hard to write if I can't get it to work üòä.

Hi @factorlive,

Seems like there's something wrong with your asset configuration. In your `dfx.json` I see you specified `source: [ "src/hello_assets" ]` which made `dfx` upload all the files in that folder as is. The `source` array specifies a list of files and folders to upload to the asset canister.

What you want instead is uploading the _output_ of your build step (the webpack.config.js).

When accessing your frontend canister https://jvgaw-3umaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-caaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q.ic0.app you basically try to download a `index.js` file at the root. If that file isn't uploaded in the asset canister it will show `not found` as the error.

You can check which files are in your asset canister using list:

Hope this helps!

This is my key take away! *Thanks* and this helped a lot. The **problem** was that I had **node not installed** on my tiny Amazon instance üòÆ. So the dfx deploy command did not trigger the build process.
