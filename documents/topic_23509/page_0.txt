Hi everyone,

I want to announce a quality of life feature in Motoko. This builds upon previous work by @lwshang on `dfx deps`.

Currently, you can import canisters into Motoko programs like so:

```
import Ledger “ic:ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai”;
```

This assumes that you have the candid file of the canister under your local `.dfx` directory.

A good way to retrieve and manage these candid files is to use the [`dfx deps`](https://internetcomputer.org/blog/features/dfx-deps) feature. You can do this by specifying the canister you want to import as a dependency and pulling it. This not only retrieves the candid file of the canister, but it also grabs the wasm for it so you can deploy a local version of your dependency to test against.

But what about the management canister? The management canister isn’t a real canister and thus it cannot be made pullable. The next release of `dfx` will contain a quality of life improvement where `dfx` will automatically emit the candid for the management canister if you import it into your Motoko program. Thus, something like the following will build on its own.

```
import Management "ic:aaaaa-aa";

actor {
  public func rand() : async Blob {
    await Management.raw_rand();
  };
};
```

Please let us know if you have any questions or run into any bugs!
