Hello,
I am encountering a specific issue when attempting to integrate a local replica, Candid UI, with an online IDE/workspace, like Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces. Here's a brief overview

**Environment**
- Any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave latest versions)
- Using an online IDE such as GitPod.  
- `dfx` version: 0.15.2
- Local deployment.

**Steps to reproduce the issue.**
1. Start a GitPod workskpace, [such as the one provided for Motoko Bootcamp.](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp/dao-adventure-training)
2. Start a local replica: `dfx start --clean --background`
3. Deploy a canister: `dfx deploy project_1` (assuming we're using the repository provided at step 1)
4. Click on the URL to access the Candid UI of the deployed canister: `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai`

**Error message** 

![Screenshot 2024-01-03 at 10.34.20|690x314](upload://rtbeBPpt9pF2kawFdSKyABOdTwt.png)

- In the console (warning message): `Could not infer host from window.location, defaulting to mainnet gateway of https://icp-api.io. Please provide a host to the HttpAgent constructor to avoid this warning.`
- In the console (error message): `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
`

**What I've tried**
- I've made sure that the port 4943 of the Gitpod workshpace is exposed. The `.gitpod.yml` file contains the following lines: 

```
ports:
  - name: Replica
    port: 4943
    visibility: public
    onOpen: ignore
```

The Candid UI canister is accessible, as well as the local replica so this is clearly not the issue. 

**What I believe is happening** 
I think the problem comes from the format of the "real" URL in the GitPod workspace. Unlike the typical format `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai`, it appears as `https://4943-motokobootc-daoadventur-s4o8fjy7a8a.ws-eu107.gitpod.io/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai`. This discrepancy might be causing an issue with the Candid UI canister's code, particularly in how it generates the `HttpAgent`. It seems to be attempting communication with the mainnet rather than the local replica. This issue aligns with similar problems discussed in [this forum thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assistance-required-backend-frontend-connection-error-subnet-not-found/24752).

The root of the error may lie in the `is_local` method within the Candid UI canister, as indicated [in this code snippet](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/blob/7b45d8a4c29ec1b3bbbb727ac0675b1bd117585b/tools/ui/src/candid.ts#L15C4-L15C4).

Right, the `is_local` check is not very robust. Can you try `bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai.localhost:4943/?id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai` to see if it works?

To help us better troubleshoot, can you check in the browser console, what's `window.location`? `is_local` is only used to decide if we want to fetch the rootkey. Another thing we can try is to always fetch the rootkey: https://github.com/dfinity/candid/blob/7b45d8a4c29ec1b3bbbb727ac0675b1bd117585b/tools/ui/src/candid.ts#L25, and try to deploy this version in the gitpod to see if it works.

@chenyan thanks for answer! 

Below is `window.location`
```
{
    "ancestorOrigins": {},
    "href": "https://4943-motokobootc-daoadventur-f63kr2ycdxm.ws-eu107.gitpod.io/?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai",
    "origin": "https://4943-motokobootc-daoadventur-f63kr2ycdxm.ws-eu107.gitpod.io",
    "protocol": "https:",
    "host": "4943-motokobootc-daoadventur-f63kr2ycdxm.ws-eu107.gitpod.io",
    "hostname": "4943-motokobootc-daoadventur-f63kr2ycdxm.ws-eu107.gitpod.io",
    "port": "",
    "pathname": "/",
    "search": "?canisterId=bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai&id=bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai",
    "hash": ""
}
```

Seems like it's indeed the issue. The rootkey is not being fetched then.

For anyone who is still running into this issue, I managed to identify the root of this problem as a change in the `@dfinity/agent` npm package in version 0.19.1. 

Bugfix PRs:
https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/pull/822
https://github.com/dfinity/candid/pull/511

If you're encountering this in your own front-end canister (outside of Candid UI), a temporary workaround is to downgrade to `@dfinity/agent` version 0.19.0. 

Cheers!
