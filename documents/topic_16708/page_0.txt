specifically, there is a function in my dapp where user can create canisters containing data(anything like pics, videos, etc.) but to do this, my dapp is the one flipping the cycles bill. using the nns i can create function to charge people but this is in ICP not cycles. is there a way i can have the initiator of the process(internet identity anchor) get charged for the cycles needed to create the canister. 
so i was wondering is anchor have their own ICP addresses, any type of identification that can be used as a billing address.
are they built with canister ids? i can try working with that.

You can ask users to send cycles with their function call. Have a look at Motoko's [Cycles.avialable](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/motoko-ref/ExperimentalCycles#value-available) and [Cycles.accept](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/motoko-ref/ExperimentalCycles#value-accept) functions.
