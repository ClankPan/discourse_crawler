With all due respect, who ever is in charge of the music on the latest X spaces & post

Please play some modern and up to date music. It is a important part.

I remember the great intro tracks on the Dfinity monthly R&D a while ago, they were so good, people used to ask about what tracks were paying & made comments saying they loved the intro music & it stayed in their mind. The music that has been added recently makes one want to turn straight around and walk away.. What happend? 

I think its a important part, if one decides to add music, it should be good and up to date.
Maybe somebody else should be in charge of that :slight_smile:

Nice. Could be what ever, the early intro tracks that were played before the monthly R&D livestream started always left a great impression.
