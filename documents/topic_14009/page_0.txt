 So I recently upgraded DSCVR to `0.11.3` and Im setting my maxTimeToLive to 7 days.  I checked the `ic-delegation` expiration and it calculates to be about 7 days in the future example: 

`expiration: "16fd8851c245d84b`  

If I don't touch anything on DSCVR and just leave the page open, within about 10 mins the `ic-delegation` and the `ic-delegation` will be removed from my `local storage` and log me out.  Sometimes it's much faster.  The only change that I believe has happened is the update to `0.11.3`.  I don't see any errors or messages in my console and for testing purposes I only have a single tab open.

I also have not been able to keep up with the updates that have been happening, so I'm curious if there is something I'm doing wrong.  

```
    "@dfinity/agent": "0.11.3",
    "@dfinity/auth-client": "0.11.3",
    "@dfinity/authentication": "0.11.3",
    "@dfinity/candid": "0.11.3",
    "@dfinity/identity": "0.11.3",
    "@dfinity/principal": "0.11.3",
```

I have my authClient configured as such the one below with the intention to mimic the example as much as possible to assist in debugging.

```
const authClient = await AuthClient.create();

      authClient.login({
        maxTimeToLive: BigInt(7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000),

        onSuccess: async () => {
          const identity = await authClient.getIdentity();
          //abstractly like this
          agent = new HttpAgent({
            host: "https://boundary.ic0.app/",
            identity: identity,
          });
          await agent.fetchRootKey();
          this.actor = Actor.createActor(idl, {
            agent,
            canisterId: 'aaaa-a',
          });
        },
        onError: () => {
          
        }
      });
```

Thank you

I used to not set any particular `maxTimeToLive` and literally set a 1 hour duration yesterday. Now that you are saying it, I also noticed it actually expired after few minutes. I also use v0.11.3.

@kpeacock `maxTimeToLive` is still the option to use to make session live longer right?

Looks like there is a IdleManager which logs the user out after 10 mins

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/authclient-update-idle-timeouts/10464/9

This is what it watches
https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/main/packages/auth-client/src/idleManager.ts#L25

You are right. I remember the idle manager has an option (even though I had a look to the PR).

From [README](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client):

> If you pass no options to the IdleManager, it will log you out after 10 minutes of inactivity by removing the `DelegationIdentity` from localStorage and then calling `window.location.reload()`.

It seems there is also an issue with `disableIdle` that was reported: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/issues/576

-------------------------

Actually disabling the idle checker seems alright. Had my browser open for more than 10min and the session was still on. Can you try following as well @rckprtr?

```
AuthClient.create({
          idleOptions: {
            disableIdle: true,
            disableDefaultIdleCallback: true
          }
        })...
```

I use create authClient in a couple places for different things, I had to disable it on every place I use it.

@rckprtr did it work out for you?

I've build a new dapp this weekend and set 7 days expiration and used above settings (https://github.com/papyrs/cycles.watch/blob/main/src/lib/stores/auth.store.ts) but I actually still get logged out after few minutes ...

-------------------------

Yes, I ran into a snag.  I call AuthClient.create() in two different spots in my code.  I had to make sure I passed in the idle disable for both of them.  I also did not have time to fully test it so I also disable the onIdle call back also.

LMK

Thanks. Looks like that was my mistake too. I set the options on my sign-in function but forgot to set these for my sync and sign-out functions too. Extracted a utilities to create the auth-client seems to have done the tricks ðŸ¤ž
