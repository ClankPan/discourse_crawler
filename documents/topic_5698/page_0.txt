I created a side project that includes a bunch of utilities and a Makefile. All interactions with IC are either through simple open source utilities, or packaged in shell scripts. No more dfx or cycles wallet, although I know you probably love them! But I just want something simple & flexible, no black box magic!

Still in very early stage, and only Linux is supported (WSL should work, but not tested). So please do not base your critical work on it. Any suggestion is welcome!
