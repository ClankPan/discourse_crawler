Thanks for the update, @Luis !

I updated the link to the corresponding RC branch and had to update the release notes due to some last minute changes.

The rollout of the latest replica version is proceeding without any issues. We can already see a huge improvement in the manifest computation of our state manager with the latest release. This chart shows the difference in one of our subnets with a huge state size before and after the version upgrade:

These changes are now available for testing in dfx 0.8.5, which has been released but not promoted. To install 0.8.5 now, you can use the command

```
DFX_VERSION=0.8.5 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
```

Last minute we got [a minor hotfix](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/67246c84f0dc1531baf82a655911508bba156f84) in that needs to be rolled to the `k44fs` app subnet that has [a running incident](https://status.internetcomputer.org/incidents/bvj16hzg890l). 
Still a good release. The bug existed since Genesis.
Expect a new proposal soon electing a [new replica version](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/009c76f820426fa371d7e050bc3e4a96d44462f0).

The rollout of this replica version was completed yesterday by [the upgrade of the NNS subnet](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/40191). 
[The next RC is already announced](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/release-notes-for-new-replica-version-50ead/10340) and currently qualified.
