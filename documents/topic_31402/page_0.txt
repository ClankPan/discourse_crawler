Hi everyone.

Is it possible to use the treasury of an SNS for Neuron rewards for a period of time and then kickstart the regular minting process when disbursing?

How to do it via the yaml file?

Thank you in advance.

Hi @CapuzR , not quite sure yet what your intention is.
Is it right that you want to first give neurons rewards from the treasury and at some point later switch the to having rewards that are newly minted tokens?

> minting process when disbursing

I was not quite sure what you refer to by "when disbursing". 

There is no built-in way in the framework to automatically reward neurons with maturity from the treasury. 
Technically, what you could maybe do is implement rewards in an SNS-owned canister that tracks voting and rewards the neurons accordingly, move some of the treasury to this canister by proposal, and then have this canister reward neurons. This would then not be in the form of maturity, so you would have to consider what tokenomics and other (non-technical) implications this has.
On the yaml side you would then define that at the start there are no rewards and after some time change the parameters of the SNS to now have rewards.

Thank you Lara.

That answers my question!! 

Rewarding the users via additional SNS-owned canister could be done using the same maturity model that SNS uses, or maybe easier could be to track the disbursement and simply distribute rewards when the app detects that the maturity has been disbursed.

Right, but just to be clear again: this could be done in a similar way but another canister would not be able to actually increase the maturity of neurons. So the rewards would have to be distributed in some other form.

Totally clear!!

Separate canister to distribute rewards.
