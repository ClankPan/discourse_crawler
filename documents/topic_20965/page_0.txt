Explain it to me what "a link between traditional businesses and a decentralized token on the blockchain with the aim of creating a community-oriented economy flow." is.  So we can add it to the new projects list. Thanks

How is asking about a project on the forum considered SPAM ? Who did I piss off with this ?

The security and facilities of the ICP blockchain support the COE structure...
This is a bit different than if the ICP development team had contributed directly.

In other cases, there was no financial support and the only support was in the development path.

ICP as the blockchain governance token in which the COE is built can be the first supporters, but if the ICP development team is not satisfied that the ICP token is placed on our website, we can remove it.
