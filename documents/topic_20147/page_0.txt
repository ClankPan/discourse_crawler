Hello, I am using connet2IC for my gameProject, and locally deploy a ledger canister with port:55018, id:dmalx-m4aaa-aaaaa-qaanq-cai.   all works fine, until I usetransfer  as your vedio. I failed with the message:
connect2ic-core-providers-plug-wallet.esm.js:278 Error: Server returned an error:
  Code: 404 (Not Found)
  Body: Canister ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai not found

    at Object.s [as resolver] (<anonymous>:149:2456)

    at e.onMessage (<anonymous>:149:3162)
    at t.receiveMessage (<anonymous>:137:857)

I have config the provider:
const providerA = new AstroX();
const providerI = new InternetIdentity();
const providerP = new PlugWallet({
  dev: true,
  // The host
  host: "http://localhost:50518",

  // Certain providers allow you to specify a canisterId for the Ledger canister
  // For example when running it locally
  ledgerCanisterId: "dmalx-m4aaa-aaaaa-qaanq-cai",
  // Certain providers allow you to specify a host for the Ledger canister
  // For example when running it locally
  ledgerHost: "http://localhost:50518",
});
const client = createClient({
  providers: [providerA, providerI, providerP],
  globalProviderConfig: {
    // Determines whether root key is fetched
    // Should be enabled while developing locally & disabled in production
    dev: true,
    // The host
    host: "http://localhost:50518",

    // Certain providers allow you to specify a canisterId for the Ledger canister
    // For example when running it locally
    ledgerCanisterId: "dmalx-m4aaa-aaaaa-qaanq-cai",
    // Certain providers allow you to specify a host for the Ledger canister
    // For example when running it locally
    ledgerHost: "http://localhost:50518",
  },
});
and I redeploy canister serval times. I am with the react?  and i am trying the plugwallet way. and set the plug right, for i transfer across accounts .
