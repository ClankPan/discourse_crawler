## Overview

Status: Closed
Project Type: Cooperative/Contest - Multiple workers can submit work, and the bounty is shared
Time Commitment: Days
Experience Level: Beginner/Intermediate
Size: USD 7'500 in ICP (at time of distribution)
Deadline: July 16th 11:59pm UTC

## Description

Digital payments in physical environments, e.g. shops, street markets etc., are getting increasingly common. With this bounty, we want to showcase the power of the Internet Computer to quickly set up a Point-of-Sale payment solution accepting ckBTC by just opening a website, and putting up a static QR code.

The solution should work like this:

1. Usage without any account: The merchant enters an existing ckBTC address, and the (open) application monitors the address and notifies the merchant about a payment. The application also allows viewing the transaction history of the ckBTC address.
2. Usage with an account: The merchant can create an account and can either enter an existing ckBTC address or create a new address tied to this account. The merchant can also set up additional notification channels to get notified about a payment by a text message. In this scenario, a backend canister needs to monitor the ckBTC account and trigger a notification, e.g. via HTTPS outcalls to courier/Twilio [1].

## Requirements

- The application allows setting a ckBTC account to monitor. Whenever the account receives a payment it will play a sound and show a notification. 
- The application allows showing a QR code that encodes the ckBTC account, such that a payer can scan the QR code, e.g. with the [NNS wallet dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/). 
- The application allows setting up an account using Internet Identity or [a related authentication method](https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-internet-computer#wallets-and-authentication) in order to set up a new ckBTC wallet.
- In authenticated mode, the application allows transferring ckBTC to another account.
- In authenticated mode, the application allows setting up payment notifications by SMS/text message.
- The application allows to review past transactions of the associated accounts (You can use the [dashboard API](https://icrc-api.internetcomputer.org/docs#/accounts/list_account_transactions_api_v1_ledgers__ledger_canister_id__accounts__id__transactions_get) to fetch the necessary data.
- Nice to have: The application allows to print out the QR code encoding the ckBTC address.


## Acceptance Criteria

- The dapp must be optimized for mobile/tablets.
- The code must be open source with an MIT license.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Design/UX
- Functionality
- Code quality

Sounds like a fun thing to build, I might be able to take it on. Last time I built for Dfinity I built The Wall – a crossover Ethereum/Internet Computer demo app where users use Metamask to login to IC. Then, they can post messages to the wall!

cool task!
I have some questions:
A single canister should handle all these tasks for all users or a separate canister for each user?

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-06-19 22:08:31 UTC | #6

Requirements look straight forward with the exception of the background notifications. It would be possible to use a timer and monitor/poll all ckBTC ledger transfers on a regular basis. That would work fine in a scenario with relative low volume of transactions. But when ckBTC picks up speed that becomes increasingly unsustainable. There is also the issue with paying for cycles for the monitoring. We don't want to introduce some kind of centralised actor in all this just to pay for cycles. 

 A sustainable setup would be to build a payment gateway canister that:
1. Accepts transfer
2. Sends notification
3. Forwards transfer to final destination. 

But from what I have read about ckBTC so far that is not technically doable, right?

-------------------------

pramitgaha | 2023-06-19 23:13:38 UTC | #7

using timers is not a good idea.
according to your idea, receiver will have to wait for a certain period to get notification of payments, till that time you gonna make payer wait.
It's doable.

-------------------------

icaten | 2023-06-20 00:01:09 UTC | #8

Since I've already built most of this between the invoice canister and the icrc1 payment flow, can I get priority? 

I'd also make it compatible with any ICRC1, just use ckbtc as the default.

[/quote]

That's up to you. I'd keep it simple, but I can see the merit of a canister per merchant architecture.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-06-20 05:57:56 UTC | #11

There are two types of notifications in the requirements:

1) If you have the website open you should get a notification when you receive a payment. So, not really background. This should be handled by polling from the frontend from my perspective. I'd just poll the balance in this scenario

2) Background notifications for signed-up users. I gave text message notifications as an example, because we think this could be used globally, but push notifications could also be added.

We deliberately don't use the invoice/subaccount design here as used in the invoice canister. There you'd watch unique subaccounts per invoice. However, this requires a QR code per invoice, and we want to have a static QR code in this scenario. Remember, this is an offline scenario where you don't have multiple people paying at the same time.

-------------------------

This is a cooperative/contest type bounty. We won't select applicants upfront. Everyone can participate and submit a solution. We'll then evaluate the submissions according to the mentioned criteria and distribute the bounty accordingly.

[/quote]

Got it. The "background notification" is tricky still if I am not missing something. 

I am assuming this: 
* Buyer uses any wallet capable of doing a ckBTC transfer. This means we have no control over that part of the flow. 
* Buyer interacts with a QR code representing the seller account. That means we cannot trigger anything from the frontend at transaction time. The buyer don't interact with a frontend at all, they just .. transfer.

That leaves us with reacting at the backend. Which means reacting to events or if there are no events, use timers/polling. 

Would it be acceptable to let the seller QR code not represent the seller address but instead a url to the seller frontend page? Then the notification can be solved easily:
1. Buyer wants to pay for something at the farmers market
2. Buyer scans merchant QR code, a web page opens
  - Merchant logo etc
  - "Enter amount to transfer" (calculator layout)
3. Buyer enters amount to transfer
4. Webpage initiates transfer, buyer signs with wallet
5. Spinner, "transfer in progress"
6. Transfer complete, webpage interacts with notification canister that sends text

Ideally, transfer and notification would be packaged together at step 4, the buyer also paying for the little amount of cycles needed for the notification.

Got it. I agree, and think the idea of a payment gateway would be a good approach if you'd want to commercialize and make it scalable. You can apply for a grant afterwards :slight_smile: 

For a demonstrator, I think the timer approach would be sufficient as well, and we could let the merchant switch it off/on or even make the interval customizable as an advanced setting.

This is also a reasonable approach but depends on a wallet standard that we don't have in place yet (See: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assigned-rfp-7-wallet-standard-reference-implementation/20024). Hence, I wouldn't want to go that route here.

b3hr4d | 2023-06-21 09:17:48 UTC | #15

Hello,

I have been working on a project, the payment system, which could be a potential fit for the requirements mentioned in this bounty. The payment is built on top of the B3Wallet, a decentralized multi-chain, and multi-owner wallet.

Here are some key features:

- **Multi-chain transactions**: The system can handle transactions across a variety of blockchains, including but not limited to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the Internet Computer.
- **Support for multiple owners**: It is designed to accommodate transactions from single owners, multiple owners, and even transactions requiring multi-signature approvals.
- **Integration with B3 Wallet**: The payment system seamlessly integrates with the B3Wallet without needing login credentials or any other form of registration, providing users with a holistic solution for their crypto transaction needs.

You can take a look at the basic example here: [Payment Github](https://github.com/B3Pay/b3-wallet/tree/main/backend/b3_payment)

I also have a demo video that walks through the process: [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM5_Lf5t0uc)

Best,
b3hr4d

cyberowl | 2023-06-21 10:05:36 UTC | #16

The UX looks way too complex.

-------------------------

b3hr4d | 2023-06-21 10:18:49 UTC | #17

Thank you for your feedback. This is indeed a demo created within the constraints of the hackathon timeframe, primarily to demonstrate functionality. I'm aware of the current UX complexities and am already in the process of refining it. The upcoming improvements include a more user-friendly UI and simpler interactions, such as QR code scanning among others.

Hey! I wanted to share a short update of Ez-POS, work still in progress.

Most features work, the major thing that remains are the async notifications. But I don't see that as a big blocker. Then there are some minor UI issues and some codebase cleanup and documentation left. Oh, and QR scanning remains also.

Try it out and send any feedback my way! Frontend is deployed here: https://hngac-6aaaa-aaaal-qb6tq-cai.icp0.io/

Is the 9th a hard deadline? I might have a difficult time meeting it as I have some family vacation planned since long this week and next.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-07-03 13:28:47 UTC | #25

We'd be open to extending the deadline for another week.

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-05 01:28:09 UTC | #26

Great, thanks! I found some time today and updated the UI wit QR scanning etc. I believe it covers all aspects of the spec now. Background notifications only thing that remains. 

Two questions:
- The API took 10 minutes plus to update after making a transfer. Is that to be expected or was it some temporary thing? Fetching directly from the canisters is more reliable but doesn't work well in anonymous mode.
- It would be nice to have access to the ledger-types when making inter canister calls to the icrc ledger canister to check for new transactions. But, those types are not published to crates.io, right? https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/5d22efeef35ba2e4a39b38a6401049b5bd6b015c/packages/icrc-ledger-types

-------------------------

pramitgaha | 2023-07-05 03:34:15 UTC | #27

it is published! https://docs.rs/ic-ledger-types/0.6.0/ic_ledger_types/

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-05 06:54:38 UTC | #28

I believe that is for the main IC ledger, not for the ckBTC/ICRC ledger.

-------------------------

pramitgaha | 2023-07-05 07:30:17 UTC | #29

icp ledger also follows icrc1 standard. so this will work for sure.

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-05 08:00:00 UTC | #30

I mean these types, for instance the response to `get_transactions`:

```rust
#[derive(CandidType, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct GetTransactionsResponse {
    pub log_length: Nat,
    pub first_index: BlockIndex,
    pub transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    pub archived_transactions: Vec<ArchivedRange<QueryTxArchiveFn>>,
}
```

Or the transaction object itself:

```rust
#[derive(CandidType, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct Transaction {
    pub kind: String,
    pub mint: Option<Mint>,
    pub burn: Option<Burn>,
    pub transfer: Option<Transfer>,
    pub approve: Option<Approve>,
    pub transfer_from: Option<TransferFrom>,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
```
But it is cool, types don't need to be on crates.io, I guess they can be imported from GitHub.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-07-05 08:05:41 UTC | #31

Update: We extended the deadline by one week.

One other thing to add. It would be very helpful if you could record a quick video walkthrough when you're ready.

-------------------------

pramitgaha | 2023-07-05 08:31:13 UTC | #32

oh yeah, if you're looking for this, it's not available. I think these are only exclusive for ckbtc at the moment.

I checked with the dashboard team. It should take 90s max, and they identified what's causing the latency and will fix it.

Still considerably longer than fetching from the canister direclty.

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-08 05:05:22 UTC | #34

This was a fun project to build, got to learn some Motoko in the process when realizing Rust canisters cannot make async calls on timer events but Motoko canisters can. :slight_smile: 

I have made the ic-pos repo public, please check out the video walkthrough published below. 

Live app: https://hngac-6aaaa-aaaal-qb6tq-cai.icp0.io/

GitHub:  https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-pos

Notes:
- Background notifications not yet implemented. Everything but the HTTPS Outcall is in place, canister monitors all transactions and matches with configured store settings. 
- No sound on incoming payment. Forgot that.
- ckBTC API is still slow, will consider switching back to monitoring canisters directly but uncertain if that can be done in "anonymous" mode.

Will fix these issues when back from trip, 17/7.

Looks good! The UI seems simple and includes most of the functionality mentioned in the RFP (besides the features you included in your notes). Once enabled background notifications should be a nice addition. 

Hopefully, the API will speed up, so we can have near-instant notifications.

I hope you enjoyed learning Motoko but Rust canisters can also make async calls on timer events, see e.g. the answers in this recent thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-subscribe-to-ethereum-contract-events-in-icp/21188.

- 🟩 SMS notifications remains to be done. 

There is not way to access debug logs when running on ic, right?

icplonger | 2023-07-17 01:52:19 UTC | #46

Hi all,

My friend and I decided to take a stab at this bounty...we're both relatively new to the IC / Motoko so it was quite a learning experience. I recently completed the Motoko bootcamp and have been working in the ecommerce space for a while so I figured this project would be a great way to dive into the IC.

https://github.com/janusdotai/slick-checkout

We ran into some roadblocks with trying to use courier to do email/sms notifications - mainly, their api doesn't support IPV6 so couldn't get it working with https-outcalls.  Trying to send notifications client-side resulting in CORS issues - will figure something out this week.

Our approach was to support both ckBTC and ICP as it would seem like the natural progression of this type of app - support any kind of token in the long run.

props to @kristofer for cranking his version out so quickly and super polished code.

fun project and we'll continue to work on it ..cheers!

-------------------------

icaten | 2023-07-17 02:05:40 UTC | #47

There's this logger you can use, which afaik is has been something of an IC standard for a while--compatible with both Motoko and Rust:

https://github.com/usergeek/canistergeek-ic-js

There was a project a couple months ago offering SMS services for canisters, not sure it was open source but iirc it was working so I'm sure there are ipv6 compatible sms relays out there.

-------------------------

icaten | 2023-07-17 02:14:07 UTC | #48

Also, in case a suitable QR code scanner library hasn't been found, this article lays out the process well:

-------------------------

kryptik | 2023-07-17 05:18:43 UTC | #50

Glad to hear you're working on the bounty! [Here](https://github.com/KryptikApp/point_of_sale/blob/main/backend/service/merchant.mo) is some code that handles sending SMS via courier. Note the 'sendSMS' function. Docs and the project itself are still in progress. Hope this helps!

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-17 12:11:53 UTC | #51

Thanks, I added a super basic log function to the canister that worked well for debugging. Blocking issue is the lack of IPv4 support for HTTP outcalls.

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-17 12:17:27 UTC | #52

Yep, the IPv4 issue seems difficult to get around. I haven't been able to find any transactional email services supporting IPv6. Will continue to look though.

-------------------------

icaten | 2023-07-17 20:00:30 UTC | #53

What's your solution for determining if an API is compatible with IPV6 only replies? I found an online lookup that worked, but I'm guessing there's an easier way to do this from the command line, if anyone knows?

-------------------------

icplonger | 2023-07-17 23:14:45 UTC | #55

just ping the domain and if it resolves to an IPV4 address chances are the outcall won't work

icaten | 2023-07-18 00:54:00 UTC | #56

I had a friend who used this a while back for setting up cryptonotifications, I remember it being open source when I first visited it, but maybe it'd still work for doing outcalls from the IC:

Hey everybody,

Thanks a lot for the submissions. If the other participants don't have an issue with it I'd be happy to see @kryptik's submission as well.

@kristofer @icplonger  I'm sorry that you ran into the IPv6 issues, I was under the impression that the Courier API has been used on mainnet before, but it seems that's not the case. It'd be very helpful to find an alternative service. Otherwise, there's no way around some proxy service.

No objections to extending the deadline, thanks.

Also, seems that IFTTT works with IPV6 - its like a poor mans zapier I managed to get email notifications working with their webhooks its clunky but works for now.  They support SMS only through 3rd party providers 

https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks

![Capture|505x188](upload://3nvhBM4AclHro6y3lmDVjOQt0Vv.png)

all you need to do is send a post with your json payload to

https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/${eventName}/with/key/${apiKey}

where eventName is your IFTTT webhook applet name

Hope this helps anyone looking for a workaround

Nice, do they support the `Idempotency-Key` header though? Otherwise multiple emails could be sent when deployed to ic network (I guess).

-------------------------

kryptik | 2023-07-19 06:51:37 UTC | #61

Awesome! We are a few hours away from completion. Excited to share.

-------------------------

icplonger | 2023-07-19 14:01:07 UTC | #62

great question, I don't think they do according to their docs no mention of idempotency keys

https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010230347-Webhooks-service-FAQ

and testing this on live caused a reject error - but I did get 13 emails and a notice from IFTTT that my daily limit on the free account almost met :joy:

so yeah we need a better workaround... to me we should have a fire and forget http outcall that doesn't go through consensus 

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/   is still in draft but waiting for services to implement it will slow things down, I mean just look at all the webservices that support IPV6 :upside_down_face:

-------------------------

kryptik | 2023-07-19 15:32:04 UTC | #63

We've completed v0! 

You can try a live demo [here](https://pay.kryptik.app/). Our implementation follows the spec, though we are still working on backend notifications (dealing with the same IPV6 issues as others).  One neat feature we developed is custom URLs for each merchant page. We would also like to continue enhancing the merchant page with transitions and branding.

All code is open source and can be viewed at [this repo](https://github.com/KryptikApp/point_of_sale). The ReadMe (still in progress) has a thorough overview of the project/features.

Developing this project (our first integration with IC) has been a good lesson on various topics throughout the ecosystem: from Motoko and local replicas to https outcalls and authentication.

All feedback is welcome! Thanks for the opportunity to work on this RFP.

P.S.: A short demo video will be out soon!

Looking forward to the promotion and **applications in real life**!

-------------------------

kryptik | 2023-07-19 15:49:09 UTC | #65

Crossing the divide from interesting POC to useful application is tricky but so important!

kristofer | 2023-07-20 14:20:04 UTC | #66

✅ Email notifications, working

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-20 21:20:13 UTC | #67

And finally:

✅ SMS notifications, working

I didn't have to make any messy workaround, instead solutions feels rather clean. I deployed a Netlify function that supports IPv6 and from there makes the requests to IPv4 Courier. Simple stuff, one ts file.

domwoe | 2023-07-20 21:18:50 UTC | #68

How are you doing it now?

-------------------------

kristofer | 2023-07-20 21:22:15 UTC | #69

1. Canister calls Netlify function on IPv6. 
2. Netlify function calls Courier.
3. Courier calls Mailgun and Twilio.

-------------------------

kryptik | 2023-07-20 22:40:23 UTC | #70

Nice solution! We tried something similar with a Vercel API endpoint, but there was no support for IPV6. We'll try to implement your approach soon.

Here is a quick demo of our submission!

kryptik | 2023-07-24 22:28:49 UTC | #72

Hi! Has there been an update on the grant's status?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-07-25 08:35:01 UTC | #73

Sorry for the delay.

@kristofer @icplonger @kryptik Thank you all for your submissions! You all did a really great job! After reviewing your submissions, we'd like to announce the following distribution:

:1st_place_medal: @kristofer USD 3'500 in ICP
:2nd_place_medal: @kryptik  USD 2'500 in ICP
:3rd_place_medal: @icplonger  USD 1'500 in ICP

I'll contact each of you in private for the next steps on claiming the awards.

In addition, I'd like to give a bit of feedback on the submissions

To @kristofer 

You provide a simple and straightforward design that perfectly fits the use case. I also love the detailed comments in the code. You missed the option to print the QR code, and it would have been nice to get a direct payment notification in the app as well, in case the app is open.
In my test, I got the email but haven't got a text message.

To @kryptik 

Also a great job on design. From a UX perspective, I was a bit confused about what to add for the address in the setup, and I'm missing the info about the current balance. In my test, I haven't got a notification, besides in the app itself.

To @icplonger 

Awesome job on your first ICP project! From what I could gather it always requires entering an external wallet address, but you still have "Send ckBTC" in the menu. I'm not sure how this would work. 


Again thank you all for the great work on this! Is anyone interested in moving the project forward? I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.

One feature to be added would be to also support the [draft standard on payment request formats](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/issues/22) that has been already implemented in the NNS frontend Dapp. This would allow a merchant to specify an amount to be requested, instead of letting the payer enter the amount.

-------------------------

kryptik | 2023-07-25 08:52:42 UTC | #74

Thanks for the update and the feedback. We're glad to have participated in this bounty. 

And yes, we are interested in carrying the project forward! The next steps for our implementation would be to add the IPV6 workaround shared by @kristofer , expand support for more tokens (within ICP and possibly other networks), and adopt the payment request format.

-------------------------

@kristofer @kryptik @icplonger 

Could we get your twitter handles for a DFINITY tweet announcement?

-------------------------

icplonger | 2023-07-25 12:56:28 UTC | #76

wow this is great!  thank you for the generous award and to the other participants congrats.

I'm already building a crypto commerce saas product called supercart.ai - its web2 based/EVM focused but my long term goal is to build a fully decentralized version and I think the IC is the most suitable chain to migrate to - however my view is "any token any chain" for commerce and not just ckbtc/icp.  As I talk to merchants I'm finding they mostly want to deal in stablecoins - something we lack on the IC right now, so a few things have to come together before I can build it out but I remain optimistic.

My twitter is @ai_janus thanks!

Payment requests would definitely add value to the app. Next logical step would then be to make it more into an actual POS where merchant can register the sale and calculate total amount:
1. Add one head of lettuce, $3
2. Add one tiny super expensive bag of micro greens, $5
3. Sum total, $8
4. Show QR with payment request
5. Buyer scans and pays

Thanks for feedback, I will fix remaining issues.
- The receive page can be printed to get QR on paper. I will style it to look nicer when printed and add a print icon.
- Direct payment in app is a available on the receive page, it takes up to a minute though because of slow API. Will add notification to main merchant page as well.
- Text messages, you are right, not working. It worked well in testing but turns out the Twilio trial account only can send sms to my phone number. I do see the requests being made on Courier though so the flow is working. Will upgrade Twilio account to have a fully functional demo. 

**Edit 26/7: Issues above have been fixed.**

I'm reading through all the ecommerce threads here in the forum. I am NOT a dev but I have a 20 year ecommerce site that is fairly sizable and legit.
Seems like progress is coming along here. I'm looking for someone interested in working with someone like me to develop my catalog and payment on the IC.
I don't care about getting fiat as payment, but I have a large catalog and the functions here come close to making the basics of my operation move smoothly enough.
I want to contribute to the IC by being a real world dude using it as proof of concept.
I've made 500,000 online sales since 1999. 
I believe I could be a unique asset or partner in development here.
I'll be reading and following but really want to make this happen.

-------------------------

icplonger | 2023-11-05 19:26:23 UTC | #80

Mrweempers,

I've built an [ecommerce platform](https://supercart.ai/) to handle your exact use-case.  It can accept payments direct p2p using crypto only (I don't deal in fiat either) and it can integrate with the most popular platforms (shopify, woocommerce etc)

Everything is non-custodial but right now, only EVM chains are supported. 

I'm working on a fully decentralized version that will run on the IC, but won't be ready until next year.

Hit me up with a DM if you are interested, I'm always looking for new merchants to integrate :+1:

-------------------------

mrweempers | 2023-11-06 11:53:25 UTC | #81

Hello and thank you.
I have filled out the contact form at Smartcart in both Brave and FireFox but did not seem to land on a proper confirmation page. Also, I think I am too new here to DM you possibly? Or I can't find it.
I'm a BigCommerce site and I'd like to try and do this if you can DM me?
Thanks again.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-02-18 21:05:16 UTC | #82

Yes lets build it on the IC. Any update?

-------------------------

icplonger | 2024-02-21 14:38:21 UTC | #83

working on it!  ive been converting my web2 commerce platform to svelte/motoko so it can run fully onchain but its taking longer than expected because I decided to learn svelte at the same time :slightly_smiling_face:

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2024-02-21 23:37:50 UTC | #84

Svelte is the way to go. Good on you.
