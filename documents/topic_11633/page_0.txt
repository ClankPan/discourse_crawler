Apple has recently released a new version of MacOS. Unfortunately, this update seems to have broken Safari TouchID support for Internet Identity on Intel devices. We are investigating the issue and looking for a resolution. We have also opened a ticket in the WebKit bug tracker: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238146

We observe the following:
* TouchID on Chrome still works as intended
* External authenticators – such as YubiKeys – still work in Safari
* Apple devices with an M1 chip do not have this issue

Whether you are affected or not, we strongly recommend creating a recovery phrase for your Internet Identity anchor and periodically making sure that you still have access to it.

We are sorry for the inconvenience and are working hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

Hi! Just a heads up, after upgrading to Monterey 12.3.1 (comes with Safari 15.4 (17613.1.17.1.13)) I'm able to use TouchID on my Intel mac. Yay! :tada:
