Is it possible for users of the IC, particularly the NNS, to get push notification on their staked neurons when Actionable Proposals are available. It would be nice if something like this was accessible in the II settings of the NNS and could have a toggle to pick and choose which and when we’d like to get these notifications for certain staked Neurons!

I would love this. Great idea

Thanks! Maybe I should put this in governance so it gets seen a bit more but I think this would help empower people to vote on there own as well.

I agree with your suggestion.  It would be nice for this to be available from the NNS dApp.  

In the meantime, Synapse has a Google group where we send push notification emails for every Governance and every SNS & Nuerons Fund proposal.  I’d be happy to send you an invite to the Google Group if you send me a DM with your email address.
