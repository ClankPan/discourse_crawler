Dear IC Community,

we are happy to announce [a new replica version ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/a094b965e20a920c838b611c4e2303ef428e56d8) that will get proposed to be elected within the next 72 hours. This rollout we need to start with two versions whereby one will have sandboxing disabled for certain subnets. [See my post on the previous release](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/release-notes-for-new-replica-version-e00f7/10598/3?u=luis).
