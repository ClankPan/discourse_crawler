Hey guys, second whitepaper that I am sharing. This is something we have been working on at Bitfinity for a while now - the problem we are trying to solve is how to integrate tokens from a bunch of different ecosystems on the EVM. 

As usual, thought and comments are welcome.  https://github.com/bitfinity-network/whitepapers/blob/main/BitFusion.pdf

Some commentary on what makes a Layer-2. 

Here's a cool table from the preparing comparing Bitfinity/IC to other BTC L2s. Standing on the shoulders of giants.
