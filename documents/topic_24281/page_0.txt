Noticed this in my neuron, but if I go to edit what I'm following, this category is not there nor does that follow appear in any other category. Is this category deprecated or is it missing from the UI?

I think that's now covered by "SNS & Neuron's Fund", but I'm not 100% sure.

I'm not following them for anything but that single category though. And there doesn't appear to be a way to remove it in the UI. 

If I look under SNS & Neurons Fund, this particular ICDevs follow is not there.

Hi @nolyoi,

Thank you for raising this issue! This is a deprecated topic in the NNS governance canister. No proposals can be submitted with this topic, and therefore no votes can be cast that you would follow ICDevs.org on. My best guess is that you followed them when this topic was still valid, and therefore it is in your neuron's followee's structure, which is what is being displayed on the nns-dapp. 

The nns-dapp has removed the ability to add/remove followees on this topic which is why you can't change it on the *Follow neurons* page you screen-shotted. 

We are internally discussing how to deal with this UI issue, but rest assured that there is no risk that you may follow on this topic when you do not mean to.

Hope this helps!
Daniel
