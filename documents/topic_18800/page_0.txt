Hey dear Dfinity people,

At the moment **we got approved grant from ICP for 5k for POC creation**, it didn't came together with previous developer, so we are looking for a new one to **join our team as co-founder to help us with development and at the moment to setup both milestones for 2.5k + 2.5k POC version to be built.** After can go for 25k and we already have interest from other communities and sponsors to grow.

We already got design for our project, prototype as demo, community in Discrod that you are welcomed to join where we are launching our first contests:
