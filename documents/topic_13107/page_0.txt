* Want to build latest of replica, motoko, dfx, etc. straight from source? Check!
* Wonder where to get [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest)? Check!
* One liner to start canister development without waiting for official release? Check!
* It is cross-platforms ready! Native on m1 macbooks, anyone? Check!
* All system canisters and did files in one place? Check!
* Looking for obscure binaries such as ic-prep or ic-admin? Check!


For example, to start canister development with platform-native dfx binaries in less than 10 seconds! (network conditions apply):

```
nix-shell https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest/download/dfx-env.tar.gz
```

This will download pre-built binaries if your platform is supported by Github CI. But also offers an option if you decide to build from source (which may take quite a while)!

Because Github has yet to support aarch64, so for m1 macbook ~~the only option now is to build from source (add `--arg force true` to the above command). So not quite ready made, but still it absolutely works! :grin:~~ Edit: I uploaded pre-built binaries for aarch64 in [this release](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/tag/20220519-aarch64). Enjoy!
 
New releases will automatically be made on a weekly basis. Or you can make PRs to have github build for you!

For non [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) users, you can still check out the binaries nevertheless, if you are curious.

Just curious, do people in the community ever build the replica themselves? I can't imagine why they would do so (even for node providers). In any case, thanks for sharing!

It is mostly because I had my 5 year old surface book replaced by a m1 macbook :grin:

But also I think it is good to get the knowledge out there "anyone can build all binaries".

Hello Paul, this is a neat project ... we are having issues trying to get a docker to run the prebuilt aarch64 binaries on an ubuntu:latest docker running on a M1 chip ... the dfx start works and launches a replica and icx-proxy nicely, but when launching even the "dfx new hello" project with a "dfx deploy" it crashes the replica and starts to "stop" and then "start" after trying to create the default identity and wallet ... here is the output: 

```

[quote="mbeekman, post:4, topic:13107"]
we are having issues trying to get a docker to run the prebuilt aarch64 binaries on an ubuntu:latest docker running on a M1 chip
[/quote]

That is an interesting setup. So you run a native aarch64 docker on m1 chip?

What is the command line you used to start the nix-shell? BTW. thanks for trying out this project!

-------------------------

PaulLiu | 2022-10-17 16:25:11 UTC | #6

I was able to reproduce the bug under aarch64 linux. Will try out a fix. Stay tuned!

-------------------------

mbeekman | 2022-10-17 18:30:12 UTC | #7

thanks ... let me know if I can help... also did nothing special to start it ... just replaced the url with the aarch64 branch as you recommended in your amendment:
```
nix-shell https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/download/20220519-aarch64/dfx-env.tar.gz
```

-------------------------

PaulLiu | 2022-10-18 02:36:54 UTC | #8

I made a fix but it will take a couple days to trickle down to the public repository of ic. Likely in next week's release of ic-nix (dfx-env) we will have it.

-------------------------

PaulLiu | 2022-10-24 11:46:14 UTC | #9

@mbeekman The problem should have been fixed in the latest release:

```
nix-shell https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/download/20221024/dfx-env.tar.gz
```

Please try it out :slight_smile:

-------------------------

mbeekman | 2022-10-24 22:57:51 UTC | #10

Awesome sauce! ... I will try it and circle back with the result here

-------------------------

der0pa | 2022-10-27 17:33:31 UTC | #11

NICE work Paul

not a dev but i got this up and running on my m1 mbp...  we only need a couple more layers of abstraction and some co-pilot AI  and I just may learn to "make" a program yet. :-)

-------------------------

mbeekman | 2023-01-28 23:16:11 UTC | #12

Just closing the loop here ... it came up with another thread on gihub about dfx ... thanks again Paul ... your works is appreciated...
