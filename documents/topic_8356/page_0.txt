The official guide say following:

Because the Internet Computer supports dapps compiled to standard WebAssembly modules, you can use standard compilers and toolchains to build applications in languages such as C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages and the `Clang` compiler.

So, Is only the CLang compiler support for C/C++ language? Is Emscripten(emcc) compiler be supported?

No, that's not technically possible, see my other reply.
