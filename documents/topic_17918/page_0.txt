In this bounty you will:

1. Add documention about how pipelinify works.
2. Create examples for:
    * Moving a file from one server to another
    * Extending a process to run across multiple rounds
3. Add the timer API to automate the execution of multi-round tasks.
4. Update from Hashmap to [Map](https://github.com/ZhenyaUsenko/motoko-hash-map) v0.7.0
5. Configure for vessel and MOPs.


This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn about Motoko
* learn about async message flow
* learn about timers

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work writing tutorials and any other open-source contributions(ie. your github).
* Include a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding

The bounty was generously funded by the DFINITY Foundation. If you would like to turbocharge this bounty you can seed additional donations of ICP to 269b560f921487247b75d5507c9af250af3a932c372111fa5fbb66eba64354c5.  ICDevs will match the bounty $40:1 ICP for the first 50 ICP out of the DFINITY grant and then 0.25:1.  All donations will be tax deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.  If you send a donation and need a donation receipt, please email the hash of your donation transaction, physical address, and name to donations@icdevs.org.  More information about how you can contribute can be found at our [donations page](https://icdevs.org/donations.html).

Hi, I can complete this task. I'm admittedly new to ICP and Motoko, however I've been programming for 8+ years on many different stacks. This bounty seems like a great entry point into Motoko, inter-Canister communication, and ICP in general. 

First, as I learn and test the tool, I can create the necessary documentation for it. Next, I can make it vessel and MOP compatible. My first contribution to the code will be upgrading it to use Map. Lastly, and at the point I have the most familiarity with the code, I'll extend its functionality to automate the execution of multi-round tasks as is required.

I can post here or elsewhere frequent updates (every 3 days maybe?).

Happy to chat further about implementation details or my qualifications.

I'll submit it to the board, but you should feel free to get started:

Hey @relaxed04 ... interested in picking this one up now that you are done with RLP?

-------------------------

relaxed04 | 2023-03-07 19:02:03 UTC | #5

Likely yes. I'll first take a quick look at what else is available and get back to you later today.

relaxed04 | 2023-03-08 14:23:39 UTC | #6

Hey @skilesare. Happy to get started on this one. 
I'm not fully aware of the bounty process here, can I get a rough idea of next steps and timelines for review and payment of RLP, thanks!

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-08 14:31:02 UTC | #7

I'm working on it.  I need to send a report to DFINITY with the completed tasks an obtain payment from them. What ever the price is on the day they pay out the grant payment is the price I use to pay out to you after the board approves the pay out.  I'm trying to get it done for you guys as we have 4 that are pending review.

-------------------------

relaxed04 | 2023-03-08 15:56:33 UTC | #8

Sounds good to me, thanks. I'll get started on this one.

-------------------------

relaxed04 | 2023-03-25 19:05:13 UTC | #9

I noticed this was reopened. Life got in the way a bit, and I've been delayed. I'll be free to re-start this in about a week if anyone hasn't jumped on it by then. Thanks.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-26 14:23:38 UTC | #10

I've submitted a proposal for you to take this one on.

Please coordinate with  @piens as he has been looking at the pipelinify stuff a good bit and may have some commentary.  https://forum.dfinity.org/u/piens/summary

@icme, @aiv, @quint, @mparikh, @cryptoschindler please vote :slight_smile:

@skilesare @relaxed04 Is this up for grabs? If yes, I would like to take it up.

-------------------------

relaxed04 | 2023-04-10 20:06:31 UTC | #12

I've started working on this over the weekend. I'll post an update here in the next couple days
