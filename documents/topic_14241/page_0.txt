= 413 out of 518 total. = 79.73%

Unless I am misunderstanding the data, which is possible: this is disgustingly centralized and easily susceptible to the same problems of cartels, censorship, and manipulation that plague EOS. This is actually MORE centralized than EOS.. This is especially disappointing for people like myself who have been trying to become a node provider for almost a year. How many of these 413 are appointed by dfinity? I'm going to guess 100%.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-07-09 20:19:12 UTC | #2

I would also like to know more about this data. @notagain DFINITY has publicly shared their plans to decentralize the boundary and other nodes, allowing anyone to get the hardware, install the software, and create a proposal to the NNS. Are you aware of those plans?

We absolutely must avoid the fate of EOS.

it's already happening. I think Dfinity has made a gross miscalculation on the importance of decentralization because it was one of the things that didn't seem to matter as much in the 2017 hype cycle where you had very centralized projects flourishing and seemingly no care given to the decentralization aspect. The market matured and changed drastically and now it is very evident, in the markets and in adoption, just how important decentralization is. 

The data in the first post is very concerning. I don't know why no one but you seems to care about it. To me it is outrageous and should be a primary focus, if not THE primary focus.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-07-10 02:21:09 UTC | #4

That being said, you are aware that DFINITY is actively working toward allowing anyone to run boundary and replica nodes, correct? The current state of decentralization may leave a lot to be desired, but it's not being ignored.

I agree that perhaps it should be given a much higher level of urgency. We're somewhat building on sand until the protocol is actually decentralized. It hasn't even been operating in an environment where Byzantines are possible yet because of how controlled the node operators are. I hope the protocol will hold up.

This is concerning. We need to diversify the distribution of nodes and hosting services. IMO decentralization aspect of nodes does not seem to be a priority for the Foundation or the community right now.

What happened to the Periodic reshuffling of nodes?

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-07-10 08:29:55 UTC | #7

Keep in mind that the network was released a year ago, and that DFINITY has already given up a significant amount of control if you look at the voting power of the NNS. Development of the IC protocol is still 99.9% DFINITY, and DFINITY is doing all of the hardware related research.

Let’s not kid ourselves that the IC is decentralized in the same way blockchains that have been around for 8+ years are, but we shouldn’t expect that to happen right away.

How decentralized was BTC or ETH 1 year after inception (honest question)? What are some realistic expectations for the speed of decentralization?

There’s also the hardware requirements and expertise required to set a rig up, not to mention the financial cost and investment risk - it’s not easy.

If you love the IC but want more node decentralization, maybe this is an opportunity for you to get involved in forming a IC community organization that will invest in the hardware to set up and run nodes on the IC? Maybe this is something the community fund looks into as well?

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-07-10 09:23:22 UTC | #8

Totally agree with you.  it takes time for the network to grow and become stable, when everything is running smoothly and the IC has many dapps that work in reality with a large number of users, the hardware is better researched.  then it's not too late to decentralize nodes, node investors will avoid the risk of hardware investment costs.  and the network is verifiable enough to expand simultaneously for investors nodes. I agree with the idea that community funds should also have a part to invest in running nodes.  it will ensure that all communities with long-term contributions and interests stick with the IC.

[/quote]

Fair point but we should also keep in mind BTC and ETH weren't securing hundreds of millions $ worth of assets at that time. 

I'm impressed this issue has only recently come up, I'd have expected Dfinity to make sure nodes were spread across multiple providers, they stated there is a huge backlog of nodes waiting to go online. Are these nodes ownee by the same providers mentioned by OP? If that's not the case why hasn't Dfinity onboarded some of the nodes on the waiting list to have more variety?

The dashboard UI could also do a better job at displaying this stat, on the main page its stated there are 50~ providers but that number doesn't mean much if a couple entities own most nodes. It's be nice to have a UI where the % is shown.

-------------------------

timo | 2022-07-10 14:16:04 UTC | #10

Looking only at the number of nodes per node provider doesn't give you the full picture. You also have to look at their assignment to the subnets. If a subnet has only 13 nodes then the best you can hope for is that the subnet is composed of 13 nodes from 13 different node providers (who are also distributed well over continents and jurisdictions). This is possible even with the high number of total nodes controlled by few node providers. As a hypothetical example think of 1000 subnets and 13 node providers each having a total of 1000 nodes, one in each subnet. Then 5 (resp. 9) node providers need to collude to break the 1/3 (resp. 2/3) threshold.

In the current situation since we only have 35 subnets the node providers you mentioned will necessarily have 2 of their nodes in the same subnet. This is not ideal and should not happen. But it is clearly an artefact of the IC being in its infancy. Growth in the number of subnets relative to the number of nodes of the largest node provider will eliminate this kind of situation.

The number of nodes per subnet will also increase. The subnets hosting the certain system functionality (NNS, SNS, ledger, cycle minting, etc.) are already larger than 13. We probably want to get to at least the range 30-50.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-07-10 15:40:17 UTC | #11

Virtually all node-related problems are rooted in Dfinity's projections of demand for the network which were, shall we say, somewhat optimistic. From the Messari report: "The team targets for the network to reach 123 data centers running 4,300 nodes by the end of 2021."
https://messari.io/article/an-introduction-to-dfinity-and-the-internet-computer

When the node count reaches 4300, the network will be substantially decentralised.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-07-10 22:55:22 UTC | #12

I’m 100% for more decentralization and post like these help us keep our eye on the ball, but we are also one year in with a mess of technical problems that we’re not anticipated and a bear market. I haven’t ever seen anything implying any plan other than further decentralization and eventually a potential badlands subnet for the adventurous.

I don't understand the rush to make bold assertions that ICP is already worse than EOS as if it's not publicly known a much larger pool of providers will be onboarded. No blockchain begins its journey fully decentralized. Bitcoin started with Satoshi owning a million of them. I can understand if there was no work being done toward improving infrastructure decentralization.

No matter how many nodes we have as long as they are hosted in data centers they are liable for the content hosted on them, they can either comply or be shut down. Then there is the NNS, which should also be more decentralized and might always take a canister down to prevent legal actions or monetary loss on the provider's end.

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2022-07-11 23:26:28 UTC | #21

There was a way to approach this suggested by lastmjs and Harrison that involved solutions such as making nodes unaware of what they're hosting and shuffling, combined with decentralized node operation should be a hit

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-11 23:27:27 UTC | #22

Those are all still very theoretical and far away in the future.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-07-12 06:03:46 UTC | #23

Unless a government can force a provider to shut down regardless of jurisdiction, then I don't see how it's possible. Let's say a project is running on a subnet with 13 or 30 nodes and only 5 of them are in the USA. Even if the USA manage to order a data center or provider to shut down the ones in its jurisdiction, wouldn't the subnet or applications keep working anyway? I might be totally wrong on this. I am assuming that it works.

 The NNS remains a point of weakness untill it's truly decentralized.

i said "reimbursed", very clearly, which is true, the costs are reimbursed 100% over time. not sure what your issue is, I just pointed out facts and you are reacting like its a personal attack to things I didn't even say.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-12 15:25:53 UTC | #25

- Even if governments couldn't force a provider to shut down in another country, they'd still have authority over those in their own. Providers have no control over the canister they host, Dfinity's solution is shifting responsability to boundary nodes, which will be able to filter which canister they serve, but will this be enough? If the new Wikileaks will be hosted on IC, do you think the US government won't care the leaked files are hosted on US servers if they are only served by boundary nodes in other countries? I'm not so sure.

- If a node provider is hit with a cease and desist, he can either shut down the node and stop receiving rewards, which will mean incurring in monetary loss and lower other provider's trust in the system, or make an NNS proposal to remove the canister, at that point voters will have to decide what's the lesser evil: protect the canister and damage the network by slowly losing providers to cease and desists or protect the provider and get bad publicity.

- Most countries have similar laws so even if nodes in a subnet are spread around they'd still have to comply with the country's request eventually.

- In the past the US has jailed people for violating US law, even tho they weren't US citizens and never did anything illegal in the US.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-07-12 16:00:06 UTC | #26

In this case, no amount of decentralization will help if a government as powerful as the United States decides to go after you, right? All of these issues will inevitably arise at some point. It will be interesting to see how we respond when they do.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-12 16:00:23 UTC | #27

Not having nodes hosted in data centers would help a lot: it's harder to send thounsads of cease and desist and there is lots of plausible deniability for the average joe, not so much for a node provider. Try seeding a torrent with a dedicated server, you'll get a notice from the hosting in 1 month max, do it with your home connection and unless you leave in specific countries you won't have any issues.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-07-12 16:29:31 UTC | #28

I agree. Running nodes residentially would definitely make it much harder for government censorship. However, that would defeat the purpose imo, which is to allow allow people built to built decentralized applications on chain that are suitable for all kinds of projects, including Enterprise level software. I don't know if I would be able to trust a node provider with my business data if I knew he was running his nodes from his basement. ICP will likely never be able to reach the same level of decentralization as other blockchain that focus is on the backend. 

Do you think running residential nodes is an option without major compromise on scalability, performance, capabilities?

[/quote]

Hard to say, performance will be impacted for sure, by how much nobody knows cause there haven't been any benchmarks in such scenarios. 
Obviously nodes running 10k hardware on gigabits connections will outpeform raspberries on home connections all the time. Some use cases like video streaming will be heavily impacted and could not be feasible or too expensive to be viable, but simpler use cases that require less CPU and bandwidth intensive operations, e.g DeFi,  will greatly benefit from the increased decentralization.

BHare1985 | 2022-07-14 20:16:49 UTC | #32

People hosting from residentual (e.g. badlands) is not at all a good solution. Akash networks realized this and backed away from their plans to focus on data center reliability. 

The most important part is to actually utilize the compute power we have now, which I doubt is even coming close considering the specs of each node and how many niche websites are on the IC right now. We need way more adoption and projects. We just have to wait until the IC needs more nodes and Dfinity will start processing through all the independent node operators who want to join, myself included. 

I think it was always known that Dfinity was going to start pretty centralized and work towards decentralization so this doesn't concern me that much, especially if there are a few random independent nodes in the subnet such that these big 8 can't collude and reach consensus easily.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-15 15:38:28 UTC | #33

I disagree, Akash is a completely different project, it aims to become the "airbnb of cloud providers" a very different concept from ICP's, they want to make it possible for providers to rent their servers without a middleman, so obviously for such a use cases home hosted nodes don't make sense.

For a chain that wants to be decentralized, uncensorable and resilient from attackers its a must have imo. They'd integrate pretty well with IC's subnet philosophy, we already have different types of subnets based on the type of services they run, at the moment there are 2 types of subnets: application and system , with more coming in the near future: SNS, storage, etc...
A subnet with lower hardware requirements and higher replication factor would cover many use cases and make the network more decentralized.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-07-20 06:06:57 UTC | #35

This is true! I personally have been following the node hardware development, and they are actively working on creating the hardware to be accessible to average users. At first they had to create the data center boundary nodes (there was a tech. reason for this), and now that they've proven it works they are working towards complete decentralization by allowing the hardware/ node providing to be accessible. However, I will say I wish it would hurry up and happen because I am excited. It is happening though...

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-07-20 06:09:11 UTC | #36

I could be wrong! I think the badlands is what users and future node hosts want. However, I have not looked into the issues mentioned above and am glad it was pointed out to look into on my own! Thanks!

Leamsi | 2022-07-27 23:40:57 UTC | #37

I think this is ICP's greatest vulnerability. I love the vision and the possibilities so much that it is depressing to see the design issues that have consistently corrupted crypto initiatives being replicated, from tokenomics to investment to lack of environmental planning and modelling at design stage (the very first BTC buyer warned about the CO2 emissions if BTC were to scale, in 2009!), and makes me extremely wary to invest. It makes financial sense as an early adopter, because I might be in a position to profit from a likely speculatory bubble, but I'm not yet convinced it makes ethical sense.

1) People in the thread have spoken of BTC as an example of decentralisation, but that is not the case. BTC, Ether,  Dogecoin and more are all, beneath the surface, hugely centralised in exactly the same way as ICP has all the hallmarks of replicating, fractally.

![Screenshot_20220710-010004_Chrome|305x500](upload://ubfIosNZoxc527iXctU4uNN519X.jpeg)

![Litecoin-wealth-distribution|690x266](upload://6tpk8UOCMUgluUUn3vo0NFR7ltj.png)

You can see that across all currencies, regardless of maturity, wealth is concentrated in a tiny number of people. If even 5 of those mega owners talk to each other, they have the power to shape the entire market and profit, and all the warnings of OP apply. So this pattern is not unique to ICP, nor a function of its youth: it is an intrinsic vulnerability in the tokenomics of all these coins.

Meanwhile, as far back as February, before the crash, 55% of BTC owners, or around 30 million people, were in the red. You can be certain they do not include the 0.01% (7000 people) who own 60% of BTC. Which means, across currencies, including this one, the vast, vast majority of investors bear all the risk, while also driving up the value for the teeeny percentage of whales.

2) In governance, those same whales, often second wave institutional investors/speculators, can artificially shape the direction of the entire ICP to maximise profit, simply by outstaking neurons and setting them to auto-follow. At that volume, they will profit whether a recommendation makes it or not, and on both ends. The recent spam exploit is crude and peanut like by comparison. Once the big funds step in, which is when they consider ICP has reached the right scale for large scale exploitation,  their exploit will not be blatant and obvious. It will be systemic and subtle. Retail investors will see value spike, and be super happy,  with gold rushes powered by belief in the vision that is now promising scale, as well as the profits. But all that rising value, will still end up with the 0.01% of whales. 

I see zero guardrails to prevent this consistent pattern, and the spam episode illustrates that good intentions or social norms are not enough. If the model incentivises speculation, speculation will happen. 

3) Finally, I worry about the investment pattern. The VCs putting millions into Dfinity are not doing it from love of humanity or a vision of a future internet. That's for the retailers whose belief they tend to exploit. But ask any venture investor (apart from true impact VCs): they are in it for the exit. And what is the VC exit pattern across crypto? A new blockchain venture has a compelling concept and a bit of traction.  Something people want to own and want to believe in and scalable. The offerings and projections are both grandiose and unrealistic to impossible (compare 2021 Dfinity projections with actual scale). You'd think VCs would balk, or push back. But you forget that it's all about, and only about the exit. The moment they put millions into the overambitious venture, that venture suddenly gains social proof for retailers, who believe in the promises, forge personal identities and peer groups and communities around the storytelling, typically combining certainty of societal emancipation and exponential wealth, and the venture takes off. The VCs stay until they judge the bubble is nearing its peak, but before the flaws crack the surface. They exit then, and so do the founders, making, as centralised owners of most of the concentrated wealth, a HUGE profit. And then, again and again and again, the venture crashes and burns, taking with it that 70-80% of investors that hold 0.01% of the value. Look at how many crypto ventures have crashed shortly after exit, to see the pattern.

As I said, I LOVE the concept, the potential, the storytelling, the rigour and the vision of ICP. I think what Dfinity have achieved is groundbreaking, potentially significant, and in so many ways, beautiful. So much I don't want to see the red flags. And that resistance in myself, is my biggest warning of danger.

Am I surprised that the OPs findings about distribution are not common knowledge or P1s? I have to admit I'm not. 

Would I be surprised to find that stake is similarly concentrated outside Dfinity? I would be surprised if it wasn’t. 

Would I be surprised if looking at the original projections I were to find a HUGE distance between promise and actuality? I would not.

Would I be shocked to discover recently or soon, some new players consolidating a significant percentage of all value? Not really.

Finally and above all: would I like to be offered evidence that proves me wrong?

I can’t find the article but dfinity has lots of onboarding for node providers going on every single month. It’s more decentralized every day and they are doing R&D to make it a dao type thing. These things take time

Yeah, I found the Dfinity equivalent
![3892f9b44d61d70151afbeee46da9e58ae650a6b-1537x986|690x442](upload://cT2rNEBIj1dXimePphDXySV7Zj9.png)

You can see the pattern replicated. 50,000+ people owned 0.8% less than 1000 people owned 75% of the value, the remaining 24% in Dfinity's hands. ))Dfinity is of course not for profit, but Dfinity team members have an 18% share, so ultimately do receive dividends of a sort.

Now, that was at Genesis. If I am wrong about replicated patterns, which I dearly wish to be, the data now should have improved the distribution since Genesis. However, if I was a betting man, I would bet that the distribution has likely seen even greater concentration.

I emphasise that none of this is to cuestion the motives of Dfinity or the sincerity behind the ICP vision. And VCs are pretty explicit about their profit motive, so no deception there either.

Rather I am calling attention to a set of design antipatterns that foretell a worrying conclusion.

Without knowing any private information, I would bet the concentration of ICP has greatly decreased because of the selling pressure created by taxes... but I have no way to truly know. 

Just speaking as one person: every month I (a DFINITY employee) vest on my 4-year schedule, I pay taxes. That means a sizable % of my tokens have to be sold just to pay for taxes every month. Every time i stake ICP, i sell a portion of it to pay for taxes. I am sure others (if not all) have to do the same. Just taking the team for example, if you assume a global simplistic average of 33%, that means 33% of the initial 18% of ICP (allocated to team members) at Genesis will be sold purely for taxes (unless people pay out-of-pocket which is rare in my experience). That's 6% of Genesis ICP alone.

That being said, some people merge maturity (which compounds their ICP) and others may live in lower-tax jurisdictions so it is possible that some entities have accumulated faster than others. I cannot honestly rule that out so this is my hunch.

In the longer run, ‘forced selling’ is the best thing that could happen to the IC ecosystem. It is the only way to decentralise, aside from neurons becoming tradable.

[quote="tsetse, post:11, topic:11011"]
not only are too many coins in too few hands but, crucially, the tokenomics is structured to favour their persistence in the same hands by rewarding them disproportionately. Anything that counters this centralisation is to my mind a good thing even if it inflates supply at a time such as now when the market is in terrible condition. If maturity has to be converted into liquid ICP and sold for tax reasons, so be it. In the long run, it will be a good thing that the ICP flowed to new owners. I am willing to bear the notional loss on my stake during this period.
[/quote]

This is what I wrote on the Draft Proposal: Compounding Maturity thread. :point_up:
I am happy that the concentration of ICP has been decreasing as a result of tax-related sales. Pity we will soon revert to a state of increasing concentration thanks to Dfinity's proposal 48623.

Alas, the more I dig, the worse it looks. It's bitterly disappointing as I allowed myself for the first time to have high hopes in ONE good use of crypto. Why is it that every time I do my due diligence before investing, the same emperor is standing there, still without any clothes?

I have looked without success for Dfinity's motion to dismiss, and I remain open minded to any counter evidence and counter arguments, but on the face of it, it looks pretty clear cut. Notwithstanding my hopes to the contrary, my presumption of innocence on the part of Dfinity, my implication that the design flaws were accidental, the more I look, the more I conclude that what I feared would happened, happened at perhaps unprecedented speed and I'm late to the party, and it's much worse than I feared. 

A beautiful story, with enough funding for genuine and significant innovation, from a hundred academic papers to a thousand patents, and an inspiring vision... has already been used to swindle retailers and eye wateringly enrich insiders. This chronology from the class action lawsuit seems hard to dispute. People are aware of the Arkham investigation which Dfinity loftily dismissed without providing counter-evidence ("taking the high ground"). 

But it's not an isolated speculative datapoint. There is a whole verifiable trail of pump and dump and rug pulling, and the very system that allowed that tiny number of people to literally make billions, each, just before retailers lost at least hundreds of millions, is what makes it virtually impossible to point the finger at everyone else. Millions of coins were verifiably sold at a time when all investors except Dfinity and its team and insiders were locked out from selling by vesting rules they applied to everyone but themselves, as publicly (and presumably accidentally) admitted by Williams at least twice. Once whe he clarified Dfinity had not itself vested, and once when he attempted to blame the early sales on Dfinity ex-employees, meaning that Dfinity employees were not locked when everyone else was. Since then 5 ex-employees anonymously said on reddit that they were indeed able to sell and did sell in that period. You might want to dismiss anonymous claims, but in light of a) the undisputed transactions that did take place
b) the vesting locks and limited actual sellers,
c) the acknowledgement by none other than Williams himself (his lawyers must really suffer with their client!) that neither employees nor Definity were unable to sell
And 
d) the lack of one single offering of actual evidence from Dfinity to counter tye claims above,

It seems reasonable to conclude the five redditors are telling the truth - a bit of icing on a gigantic, poisonous cake.

Can I ask, was anyone still here already in posession of the facts above? If so, what keeps you here? If not, and now you know, what keeps you here?

From conversations in other web3 spaces, the two reasons I'm presented with are:

1) Semi-religious faith. So much identity has been invested in the dream, the story, the community, the stake, that the facts above are not just financial but psychological and in a sense theological. ICP (insert alternative blockchain) is there to decentralise and emancipate the internet, therefore none of the above is enough, and there is a probable explanation even if I personally don't have one. 

That is easier than saying: given the facts above are true, this dream to which I have given the best of myself, brought others into, invested not just money but time, and mental and emotional resources, is a mirage, that has milked me and will milk me and 99.9% of the community (conservatively) for as long as it exists. 

2) Sunk costs fallacy. I've put so much money, energy, time and intent into this, and lost already so much, that I might as well stay in case "it gets better" and recoups my losses.

As I said in an earlier post. I myself, right at the start, find myself resistant to look directly at the red flags and acknowledge them. Imagine if I had invested significant savings and a year of volunteer work.  What rationalisations would I give myself to dismiss all the verifiable facts above? What would it really take after that investment of my money and my identity and time and maybe even relationships, for me to actually see what any sympathetic outsider without skin in the game looking in detail would consider transparently obvious? 

Maybe you don’t need to imagine. Maybe that is you. 

Again, if you have evidence, as opposed to pious hope or emphatic assertions, to counter the facts listed above, I will not be disappointed, but elated. There is substance to the dream. Until then, I think it may be time to wake up, and dream new, healthier, more authentic even if less grandiose dreams.

Silver lining: if the class action lawsuit is successful, you may well recoup some of your investment, and hopefully, your faith in humanity. For all their massive impact, the numbers speak for themselves: it is a tiny fraction of ICPers who are evidently bad actors. The 99.99% are mostly good people trying to improve their lives and make the world a better place. That should give us all hope, because in the end, I deeply believe that counts for more than a bit (or in the case of the seemingly corrupt top of the pyramid a HUUUGE amount) of money in the bank.

Would LOVE for the motion to dismiss to completely refute my post. If anyone has a copy, please let me know.

I don't believe Dfinity played fair at launch by locking in some holders and not others but, on the other hand, I don't think anything it did was criminal. 
Early participants who couldn't cash in at the start will still make a profit, so one cannot feel too bad for them.
The problem was not that Dfinity sold too much, as your entire note suggests, but that there was *too little supply* early on. That is what caused the price spike, aside from the entire market being in bubble territory at the time.
Investors who bought at ridiculously high prices and later filed a class action lawsuit are idiots. Whatever happened to caveat emptor?
I am sure there is heartburn among current Dfinity staff as well, knowing that a few ex-employees made tens of millions around the launch. Speculatively, that might be why proposals like 48623 are being prioritised.
No matter how the launch was handled, I do not believe the current price of ICP would be very different from what it is at the moment. It would have opened much lower if seed round participants had been allowed to sell from the start. Maybe it would have been around 50 on the first day and then drifted down to approximately where it is now. 
Had that happened, the IC would not have the reputation of being a scam that it now does among large sections of the community. I do blame Dfinity for that huge overhang. Both on grounds of fair play and to let the market settle at a reasonable level it would have been better to let all early participants access tokens easily and sell them quickly.
On the other hand, the one major plus of the way things went is that Dfinity is well funded and can comfortably ride out the crypto winter while continuing to promote developer growth. It has increased its head count while the industry is cutting jobs.
The fundamental reason the price is so low currently is that network uptake has been far slower than predicted and landmark advances have been delayed by months. Once BTC integration, SNS and a few DeFi related issues are sorted out, this will begin to change. That is why we on the forum remain optimistic. Even if everything in your post and Arkham's report is accurate (and I doubt it is), it does not warrant a lawsuit from early buyers or pessimism about the future of ICP.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-07-29 17:04:37 UTC | #44

There is plenty of blame to go around, specifically on Dfinity for the way launch was handled. Your biggest claim against the foundation is that some people were allowed to sell and some were not. Ok, so what? Was it criminal and unethical? I don't think so. I do believe that was a mistake. Everyone should have been allowed to sell and let the market decide what the correct price of ICP should have been. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It is what it is. I think the best viable solution now is the look at what happened and learn from the situation, not scrap the entire project.


 I can only speak for myself. I am here because I like what the foundation is trying to build. It's revolutionary in many ways and has the potential to change Crypto fron being used for speculation to real utility. I still believe that's possible. So no, even if everything you said was correct I don't believe that's enough for me to abandon the project.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-07-29 18:20:05 UTC | #45

Yes, I completely agree with your opinion.  The important thing is that they are building good things that have practical applications and taking crypto in a new direction where it is more practical in the future.

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2022-07-29 18:31:30 UTC | #46

Leamsi, I think the biggest evidence against ICP being a rug pull is the activity of its community. It might be worth taking some time to read about the various projects and developments going on in other topics on this forum.

The idea that Dfinity is a giant scam makes no sense whatsoever to me when I see the amount of hard work, patience, and effort being put in by the people who are closest to the project. Their devotion speaks volumes. If they are still hiring, building, answering questions, and releasing new updates when ICP is sitting at $5, what exactly is their exit strategy?

If this is a rug pull, the Dfinity team clearly hasn't gotten the memo.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-07-29 18:58:53 UTC | #47

The scam claim is not only ridiculous, but it is also intellectually dishonest. Nobody has been duped. People chose to buy ICP at the bull market's peak, despite the risk of being left holding the bag for some time. ICP is not the only legitimate blockchain that has experienced a massive drop following a hyped launch with limited token availability.

No top protocol has been without controversy, whether it's the ETH rolling back of a smart contract, MEV, BTC blocksize wars, Solana shutdowns, or accusations of hidden supply. Nobody argues that Dfinity is blameless and could not have handled things better. In hindsight, it would have been better to let everyone sell, and the price naturally found its bottom. But hindsight is 202/20. 

The Arkarm study is garbage since it ignores the cause of the crash, which was mostly futures driving the token price to unsustainable levels prior to the launch, as well as a lack of token circulation on exchanges.

It would have dumped anyhow because it made no sense for a brand new project to be in the top ten in terms of market capitalization.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-07-29 23:13:10 UTC | #48

I have literally no skin in the game. This was all my due diligence, precisely because I do find many of the projects and ideas exciting and full of potential.

Because I have no skin in the game, I began with a presumption of good faith, offering my help to the project in the sustainability sphere. So this is no hatchett job on my part, and as I said, I would like nothing more than to be proven wrong. I looked for the motion to dismiss to hear the other side and find some counter evidence. 

Having said that, the answers here fall into my first category.  I believe because I believe. When people say (paraphrasing) "dfinity handled it wrong at launch but now it's all OK", and "caveat emptor" and "nothing wrong " and "price would have been the same as now in the end", people are, I suggest, just avoiding cognitive dissonance, rather than courageously looking at the facts.

If the allegations are true (and they can be verified by anyone in the links provided in my screenshot), this was not "handled poorly", nor was it an accident of insufficient liquidity or futures, nor was it simply "unfair" that everyone except Dfinity, its employees and insiders was locked out at peak price. The 22 accounts that sold millions of ICP made billions of dollars. Many billions. Each. To put that in perspective, if you spent $100,000 every single day, it would take you 500 years to spend just 1 of those billions.

Meanwhile, by the time the lock expired, all the other, investors,  the very people who added value to the coin, on the pretty obvious understanding that no one could sell before them, lost 95% of the value of their investment. I believe it's more than that by now.

Again, very happy to be shown evidence rather than faith that any of this is wrong. But it IS a blockchain. We know, indisputably, how much ICP was sold at the time. And we also know the vesting terms applied to literally everyone except Dfinity and whoever Dfinity sold to or transferred to at that time.

Collapse in the value of the coin, furthermore, can be clearly tracked to key disclosures of dishonesty, unfairness or misdirection. First crash after there was a massive selloff during investor lockdown. Second crash after a tweet revealed vesting terms had not been universal contrary to all previously understood claims. Third crash when a further tweet disclosed that Dfinity employees had not been locked either.

So yeah, you can argue that it was an "accident" that those early sellers somehow managed to make billions from selling millions of ICP on the down low without competition at peak hype cycle, deciding, enforcing and hiding the very rules that placed them in zero competition, 100% control. And that the 95% crash that followed successive revelations had nothing to do with the very people who revealed them. Or that the fact that everyone other than Dfinity understood, on the basis of Dfinity's public claims, than no one was excepted from lock out vesting terms. That is a whole lot of "luck" falling one insiders' wallets, and extraordinary bad luck chancing upon everyone who took Dfinity's claims at face value.

Or you can conclude that a few savvy investors designed the perfect system to massively inflate then exclusively sell a crypto currency, rinsing and repeating, more rapidly and effectively, patterns seen again and again. Occam's razor wouls suggest one of these two scenarios is more plausible.

The only counter argument offered so far with potential plausibility would be the one that says, if this was a scam, why is Dfinity still working so hard and investing so much in ICP? But looked at more closely, this is a subtler version of I believe because I believe in Dfinity's storytelling. It would be like asking why the 7 people who control Dogecoin are still in Dogecoin after making so much money off a crypto joke. Because it's still a money maker, as long as there are true believers buying in, even at a tiny, minuscule portion of its top price. Read Greater Fool Theory on Wikipedia.

These people have already made the billions by selling without competition at the timing of their sole choice. The fall in value doesn't touch them. They are now beneficiaries of the ecosystem, and make money when one blockchain rises, and also when it falls. In addition, the project can still attract millions of investment,  which goes directly into both the salaries,  and the storytelling behind what has moved from spike bonanza to steady cash cow. 

And maybe, just maybe, they'd like, as a cherry on top, to actually make a success of the vision, validate the story, and clean up their billions. Once people get billions, they often move onto thinking about legacy. Today, perhaps the majority, and certainly a significant proportion of criminal wealth is invested in the lawful economy. The success of their above board activities may financially launder, but does not ethically clean or balance out injustice.

So as I said, I think it might still make financial sense to invest now. But I'm not sure it makes ethical sense for me personally, when the people who exploited the system so successfully,  are still custodians of the story, with most votes outside of governance on autofollow, and a degree of influence and opacity scarcely less than when they rigged the vesting terms to their advantage. Any look under the hood, I think, will show deep down centralisation. Those who say things have improved or are improving, I suspect are either in the top 10 percenters, or, far more likely, in the 80+ percent that STILL, I am confident, hold less that 3%, maybe less than 1% of the value. Perhaps the 1% has now shared a bit more of the pie with the top 10%. I would be astonished if the ratios for the vast, vast majority have changed. 

If no one else has, or does this analysis and update, of the actual present distribution of ICP, I might if I find time. 

Please, if you have any hard facts other than, Dfinity says it's all good so it probably is now, and the vision is inspiring, and so many in the community are devoted to it, so it can't be exploitative or designed to enrich a very few, and Dfinity is full of lovely people, they themselves say so, and things are decentralising apart from some Dfinity proposals and the node providers, and the sell off was not a bug but a feature for decentralisation, and this is the panglossian best of all possible words, then, to quote Moliere, "all that is very well, but let us cultivate our garden." Or to quote Monty Python, "the Romans, wonderful people the Romans".

-------------------------

darien | 2022-07-30 00:04:39 UTC | #49

so maybe we should pass a "robinhood" type of proposal...take from the whales and give to the retail investors...that way your desire of having a perfectly decentralized Internet Computer will be satisfied ah?

You already stated that you have no skin in this game so I have to assume that you are a "concerned" citizen looking out for the well being of other...so my question to you is....what is your end game, are you digging deeper to convince yourself of investing on the project or to scare off other with your walls of text containing information that must in this forum already know. 

There is no time machine...things were not optimally done but it seems to me that Dfinity is trying to improve them...it takes time.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-07-30 00:14:11 UTC | #50

You're reading far too much into this. I moved on from the launch and catastrophe over a year ago. I've gone over this story with others whose thoughts were already made up. Honestly, it's a waste of effort to debunk every allegation someone makes. My answer to people who distrust the foundation this much is to move on to different projects they believe in.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-07-30 01:28:10 UTC | #51

Yes, from a starting point of wanting to invest not just money but time on the IC (I'm a software engineer and excited by the engineering possibilities). I'm reading deeper as due diligence, You are watching live as I discover stuff around a thread began by OP,  not me, warning about excessive concentration of power in node network.  If you read my posting history you'll  see the journey from simple enthusiasm, to environmental questions, to design questions, to ethical questions, as I avidly seek facts in ICP's favour.

My only distinction is that I'm not trying to convince myself, which is what I see people doing and "moving on". I'm trying to find actual evidence my concerns are unfounded, in order to put not just skin but heart and body into ICP. But the more I look, the worse I find. 

Finally I appreciate this is old news for many of you, but if it's been debunked many times, I simply ask you point me to a factual, evidence backed thread, rather than a reaffirmation of sentiment. If the facts I pointed to, not just from the Arkham report but several sources set out in my screenshot, are easily debunked, and this is old hat, I'd be grateful if some kind soul saves me and everyone from my walls of text, and gives me a link. Am I truly the only one here that finds this not just historically but currently problematic from a standpoint of either ethics or risk (dishonest actors would affect both)?

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-07-30 01:31:22 UTC | #52

Just hope you could focus on the positive thing rather than the bad thing (just maybe). Time will say, follow your heart to keep building, maybe on #ICP, maybe #ETH if you don't like #ICP.

darien | 2022-07-30 01:37:24 UTC | #53

@Leamsi 
if you keep digging deeper...you might get to more than -95% or -167% maybe -250%

tsetse | 2022-07-30 03:08:02 UTC | #54

You say you have done 'due diligence', but all you have is a report from a year ago, which you are quoting like so many have done. That is not due diligence. Due diligence would include asking why Arkham has only ever produced one report in its entire existence, why its account started tweeting when the report came out and then stopped for a year until a counter was produced. Due diligence would include reading cryptoleaks.info's response to Arkham. 
Above all, due diligence would include understanding a bit about the technology involved, about which you have written not a word. It isn't anybody's words which are the basis of the community's trust in Dfinity it is the actual verifiable working technology.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-07-30 11:28:39 UTC | #57

I don't understand if you say you have checked and researched very carefully so why not try to think of a project launched at that time that was overvalued, in TOP10 but in terms of technology, they didn't have anything?  If at that time people said investing for value, then the #ICP value didn't actually reach that level.  all at that time were FOMO by the price, not the actual value of the project, including me.  but I do not blame the project, do not blame others, because the decision to buy and invest is up to you.  It is your own responsibility to research and evaluate to purchase and invest.  Whether it is a big profit or a loss is up to you to decide.  Don't try to blame others.  Look at the positive direction of the project, I see #IC actively developing to change the way of thinking and bring Blockchain into more practical applications for life.  why not look at it positively that they can sell $ICP at a high price to have more reserve of resources to develop #IC in the long run, and to not need to struggle to raise more capital to survive the market  bear school???  if they sold $ICP at that time but they are still working hard on the project and developing the #IC then that's a respectable thing.  Take responsibility for your own understanding and decisions.  I personally still believe in #IC and believe in the future of $ICP

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-07-30 13:35:08 UTC | #58

Thank you everyone for your ongoing engagement,  which has raised a little the level of discussion by offering more context.

First, to clarify I don't claim to have done my due diligence. I share that I am currently doing it, and your responses are part of that. Although I have programmed a little on ether and was gifted some BTC some years ago that I have given back for environmental reasons, I own no crypto, and have no interest in getting anyone to buy or sell. My interest in IC is not financial, but ethical and technical. Apart from the seemingly universal crypto design flaws which I explored in my very first post on this thread, there are so many aspects to the IC's conception that are exciting to me I even toured their jobs board to see if I could join Dfinity. 

I am grateful for the link about Arkham. I guess I hadn't found it because I haven't really investigated Arkham, which sounded dodgy to me. The article does make a good hypothetical case, even if without actual evidence, that Arkham is probably not an honest actor either. Also interesting to learn about ICP Perp. Definitely looks dodgy. Having said that, when you take out the speculation from the article and just look at the actual facts it gives, all it really shows is that the price inflation and speculation was even more complex, and (possibly) more than one dodgy stakeholder benefited from it.

But my own concerns were not based on Arkham, which I have seen cited but haven't even read. Rather I was going off ic.rocks, which tracked ICP transactions and as far as I can see it's a good faith effort by a forme Dfinity engineer, Norton Wang, who still writes positively about Dfinity, so has no axe to grind. More crucially, sentiment aside, the code for ic.rocks is open sourced in github, so I could see what was going on beneath the hood. It looks like it's no longer maintained, but when it was it did confirm the sale of millions of ICP tokens at a time no one but Dfinity and insiders had the ability to sell. So maybe Arkham was a rival and benefited from exposing the dump, but the dump did happen. 

More convincing and coherent is the post (now deleted?) that said "It’s a fact the Dfinity engineered one of the biggest and fastest pump and dumps in crypto history to my knowledge and they or people affiliated with them made billions. That doesn’t mean that Dfinity isn’t the most promising tech in crypto since Ethereum." In this argument it still makes financial and maybe even ethical sense to invest and work with ICP, acknowledging the fraudulent start, but recognising it doesn’t change its technical protential or potential profitability. 

Here I agree, and my ethical and strategic dilemma is whether I can approach it in the same way, or whether the dodginess not only at the start (past history) but at the top (same people) is a dealbreaker. Still mulling it over. Was really hoping the community would have links or answers that showed my concerns had been fully and factually refuted. Alas, it seems they have not in all this time.

Could it be that you use the same methodology that took you to the conclusion that the decline of the ICP value is ... -167.41%  and not -95% ??

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-07-30 17:16:50 UTC | #61

I made a mistake,  i corrected it within minutes. It's -98% now. Happy to correct everything else too. As I said, I much rather be proved wrong than right. As to knowing what the Arkham report said, it's been widely cited, including in the screenshot I provided. But given the ic.rocks data and the fact I had seen Arkham discredited in the community, I didn't feel like relying on it or digging deeper. This is not a gotcha piece.  I'm genuinely open minded. All I ask for is facts to retract absolutely anything I've written. That would make me happy. Then I'd be able not just to contribute but to defend Dfinity and ICP before anyone with the same, I think legitimate, questions.

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-07-30 18:38:04 UTC | #62

In this world there is no complete truth, nor complete lie.  It's just your belief how much you believe it, and how you consider it to be true.  let go of the past to look to the present and a better future, instead of trying to figure out what you think was a lie in the past, you should take that time to look at the present and evaluate  What is DFINITY doing and how is the future of ICs.  If you rate it as good then you can contribute and contribute to build the IC to become stronger and better.  rather than dig up the past, maybe for some reason the tokenomic was not good, maybe any other reason.  But the past is the past, it doesn't make the future better.  should only evaluate the current they are actually doing, and do you want to help build the future on ICs??  Simply answer this question in your heart.  I think that's enough.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-07-30 21:38:17 UTC | #63

Very scary indeed and #Dfinity needs to do something about this. The IC needs a more diverse group of node ownership. 

One thing to note, at least the IC is transparent about who owns the nodes.  For most networks you have no idea how many unique persons are actually running the networks.

Well, one last time, thank you to all who patiently shared their perspective. I have decided that at the systemic level, everything points to a repeat of all the things that make crypto a speculators' dream. 

I think there's an illusion of decentralisation,  but 1% or less will always have way disproportionate power to shape the NNS, and the rules of the system. The economics of voting incentives all play to big whales' disproportionate advantage. It is only by autovoting for every proposal that you make most money, and only those with serious resources can do so. 

In spite of so much hope from so many, I think there will be awesome innovation, but the vision is highly unlikely to land, and if it does, it will be with beneath the surface monopolies and oligarchies. There are too many exploitable loopholes, and too much focus on monetary incentives. 

Beneath the hood, I see huge emissions issues ahead as IC scales, and I can't see the node provider concentration changing until patterns have set in. Data storage is hugely inefficient without inter-node queries, and the discussions around content moderation suggest to me that this will prove an immensely divisive faultline as the system unfolds.

Above all, I think trust is needed to invest in, and it's a different thing from faith. I see lots of believers, just like in BTC, but I see almost no transparency, a history of dishonesty, and a lot of money coming into very few hands. I am pretty confident the big investors are not, like most in the forum, believers: they are speculators. And I think we haven't seen the last of pump and dump bubbles, but they will now transfer to the apps and projects and ventures in the ecosystem, rather than ICP itself, which has already been milked. 

I wish you all luck, and that your faith in the storytelling and the visions and the dreams, proves well founded, and the custodians of your dreams, about whom you actually know so little past their storytelling, will hold that precious trust more responsibly than they have. 

I guess it is goodbye for me. I will be watching developments with interest, but I will not be joining you in your leap of faith in processes which to me seem immensely fragile and exploitable and where the facts are either not available, or not commesurate with dreams and claims.

Haha, bilingual autocorrect changed my original. Should have said commesurate. But I suspect that doesn't change your point. And yes, whatever strengths I may have, brevity definitely isn't among them.

Leamsi | 2022-08-01 05:02:04 UTC | #70

Add to the transparency list:

- no information on node providers' contractual agreements. No way of knowing how they handle data privacy, how much energy and water they consume, how much redundancy they provide, etc. 
- no tools to access the blockchain and see how many coins are being minted and to which wallets those coins are going and for what (early investors, network-hosts, staking rewards, how much and % is going to each etc). If cartels existed, no one would know.
- no obvious way to know how many canisters are active, how many are being actively developed/worked on, how many are inactive/abandoned. Number created can be a bit misleading.
- no information I can see on Dfinity Foundation's financials. Most creditable non-profits have transparent governance and financial accountability. Dfinity has just 2 board members (you need a swiss citizen for a swiss non-profit) with Dominic Williams in pretty much sole control. His use of the money is entirely opaque. We know a good amount of the millions invested have gone into a venture capital company with himself and a VC as sole controllers too. The room here for manipulation and profit, between one and the other, with zero accountability and transparency, is huge. Talk about centralisation. Williams has power of veto over absolutely everything Dfinity does and invests in, and through the VC can personally profit as though the non-profit was merely an adjunct. 


As always, happy to be corrected. These are just the instances I've come across in less than a week of due diligence. I imagine more time would reveal more. But they are serious enough.

nothing noteworthy. Just a guy putting his essays through google translate citing points from the Arkham report yet claims he never read the report.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-08-02 02:37:50 UTC | #73

Haha, google translate. 🤣  I don't believe it's quite at that level yet. And I did say I would follow developments, just not invest. The fact I got 2 likes suggests there's at least 2 people who find my essays useful. That's good enough for me. Feel free to ignore me! It's the best way to avoid my writing.

As to Arkham, I find it strange you'd resort to conspiracies when I actually shared the screenshot of my main source! I haven't  read Arkham. What I really did read closely is the class action lawsuit around insider trading.  https://unicourt.com/case/pc-db5-valenti-v-dfinity-usa-research-llc-et-al-978642

You can also find the pdf on Scribd. The standard of evidence is higher in a court of law than in a piece like Arkham's, and the lawsuit finds corroborating evidence in ic.rocks, a dfinity aligned initiative.  Which I also mentioned. You could use faith to tag me as an Arkham heretic, or just look at the actual sources I shared and make your own mind up based on facts rather than hope. I'm easy with either.

Edited for two missing words, typing on mobile as I walk.

Leamsi | 2022-08-02 03:03:41 UTC | #74

And for the sake of balance, let me just say I look forward to hearing Dfinity's side too. If you're interested, their motion to dismiss is due on the 8 of September, so just over a month. They will either provide counter evidence, or more likely try to quash the lawsuit on procedural grounds. Hope it's the former. When it's out, I'll share Dfinity's side as well, so people defending them at least have some more facts to draw on than belief!

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-08-09 02:22:35 UTC | #75

Further in the path of balance here is, not the motion to dismiss, but essentially a countersuit, arguments wise, from Dominic Williams against Arkham and NYT. It does give their side of the story which I've been looking for and I'll take time to read and digest it. 

https://dfinity.org/complaint.pdf

On a very quick reading however, and in context of the evidence from locked seed investors, the evidence in this lawsuit that at least some senior management were not locked, and the fallback into semantics to explain the transfer (not sale) of ICP, which then people could choose to transfer again, and then sell, seems prima fascie to overall not really refute the narrative of the case against Williams. But will have to look more closely to confirm. It shows chutzpah, but may turn out to be an own goal discovery wise. OTOH, if Dfinity prevails on both lawsuits, they will definitely have gone some way toward regaining my trust. 

Watching this space.🕵🏽

I've lost good money on ICP so far, but I also think that its value is greatly underestimated based on the tech, team, and vision of the IC.

Thus far I've given money to people who cashed out their ICP based on the idea that it is worth less than my analysis. I'm not upset about that; I simply think they are mistaken.

Whether they are insiders, investors, or anyone else, they've given up a coin that I think holds greater value than they sold it at. At some point, I think they will either reinvest or lose out. In the meantime, I'll accumulate at a discount.

There's some storytelling involved. How else can we discuss the future? But I like the IC story, and I enjoy being part of it.

Finally I appreciate this is old news for many of you, but if it’s been debunked many times, I simply ask you point me to a factual, evidence backed thread, rather than a reaffirmation of sentiment. If the facts I pointed to, not just from the Arkham report but several sources set out in my screenshot, are easily debunked, and this is old hat, I’d be grateful if some kind soul saves me and everyone from my walls of text, and gives me a link. Am I truly the only one here that finds this not just historically but currently problematic from a standpoint of either ethics or risk (dishonest actors would affect both)?
[/quote]
I agree, it may be old news. However, I have not seen one post from an IC community member answering their actual questions or clarifying with factual evidence. All I have seen is a community ganging up on an individual seeking clarity prior to dumping their life into a project. I do not think what this individual is asking for is honestly too much to ask for. In fact, I'm rather shocked that the community again sidesteps these individuals, and just shoving them into a box labeled FUD. This person has valid concerns. They should be treated as such. If you want this individual to stop, or be informed. Why are you not informing them? Why are you ignoring the direct questions they are asking? They seem very willing to accept their position is wrong. Yet, all they are getting is silenced. This is a problem for me. Too many people on here are claiming to have the answers he seeks and just say dig around. If you have proof that this individual is wrong. They are directly asking you for that. Not around about questions interrogating his faith to the IC. If these reports are fake news (beyond a Twitter post saying it's fake news, and eventually the reporter will be sued) then why is so damn hard for an individual to ask for the proof that anyone inside a courtroom or fact-checking org. would ask for and then receive. This is what concerns me. Then, moving further, those who want full transparency from the foundation refuse to come to the table to discuss tax optimization moving forward so the entire community can be "transparent". If you ask me the community is enabling this behavior from the IC.

I want to end this off by apologizing to @Leamsi for the outright disrespect given to them on this thread. You have valid questions and concerns. Not everyone in the community is like that. You have every right to continue asking and learning. ANYONE who tells you otherwise can simply ignore you. Keep asking questions and keep learning. Forget the rest!

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-20 21:18:53 UTC | #78

Of course he or she has the right to ask questions but he doesn't have the right to be given an answer. 

A lot of people here just want to build their projects in peace. I personally come here to read on the progress that the developer community is making as well as the foundation. I am not shocked that many people are not interested in conspiracy theories that may be valid or not.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-08-22 19:14:21 UTC | #79

Thank you @jsull9 for your support, and no need to apologise. I am happy to contribute questions, and as you say, the lack of answers speak for itself.

@Sormarler it remains puzzling to me, the incuriousness of many devs in web3, when our work as engineers generally requires and hones the instict to look critically at all the systems we interact with, and code defensively even against our own selves, because we know that if your system allows errors, they will come.

In this case you refer to conspiracy theories with indifference,  and want to just build your projects in peace. In the companies I've worked for, that peace is not assumed, it's conquered. We check for security vulnerabilities. We have pipelines to inspect our code. We create unit, feature, integration and e2e tests. We log behaviour for observability. We fail gracefully. And THEN we sleep with one eye open to that vulnerability or bug we will have missed.

Now here you are building your dapps, and totally unconcerned that there are no privacy or security provisions required of node providers, even though it has been demonstrated you can access node state without secure enclaves? Fully relaxed that the sole controller of Dfinity also has an ICP VC able to invest and profit from obviously privileged knowledge.  You are excited by the promise of decentralisation, but completely relaxed about the concentration of node providers, ICP owners, datacentre co-locators, ICP voting power, ICP owners, etc., etc.

None of these things are conspiracies. These are all verifiable facts you can check for yourself. 

The only question currently in the air, is whether the confirmed billions in ICP transactions from a tiny pool of people when everyone else was locked out (all parties agree on that), was a fraudulent example of insider trading, rug pull or pump and dump, or whether it was an above board, good faith, legitimate way of doing business.  The courts will decide this. 

The factual issues above (just a sample) are not awaiting confirmation: they are facts sourced from Dfinity itself.

Now for retail investors to just say "I believe!", that is understandable. For software engineers to say: "I don't care about vulnerabilities or exploits in the system, I just want to code my apps"... that I find bizarre.

But hey, to each their own. The problem, hinted at by @jsull9, is that when you shut out or ignore all your critical friends, when you choose to go with groupthink, your feedback loop gets compromised, a constant source of confirmation bias. That's when the big errors that break a system tend to happen.

esquivada | 2022-09-12 14:44:52 UTC | #82

I am not an expert in technology, the vision of decentralizing the Internet conquered me and I have invested too much money in ICP, I think that things happened at launch that should not have happened and consequently some have gotten rich because of others in an obscene way and unethical that would be enough to delegitimize Dfinity I’m tired and disappointed. But when I see the passion with which Dominic defends his vision, something tells me that not only money moves him, in his eyes I see something else, I see the fire of Prometheus. Money doesn’t satisfy the heart, changing the world when you were born to do so. Dfinity has the resources, vision and talent to see it through. We all make mistakes, perhaps they thought that the market could absorb the rug pull, perhaps ambition could, perhaps it was fate that the next day Btc punctured… let’s go to the present, learn and continue. I think the team behind Dfinity is passionate about what they do. Do you think that Dfinity will be able to solve the problems you mention above? Greetings, it has been a pleasure to read you.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 00:32:20 UTC | #84

I have stepped back for a bit, and I'm currently exploring Kadena as the most promising alternative so far. Early days.

I would say that the structural problems I noted in my last post on this are still there. The security issues, the node centralisation, the environmental haphazardness, the constraints on scalability, the conflict of interest and commercial loopholes at the top, the several more vectors of sytemic centralisation, the political distortions of voting power distributions and following protocols. The inflationary pressures and diving value pose a more serious threat IMO than the bare numbers imply (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/emergency-proposal-assessing-the-death-spiral-of-node-inflation/16458/25), precisely because of the huge vulnerability of ICP to insider manipulation, where the people that lose are the same boutique investors who lost to market manipulation at the beginning. 

At least it's not just me saying this now, and the community seems less inclined to pushback than when I made the point that the evidence for early market manipulation to the benefit of Dfinity around genesis.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/emergency-proposal-assessing-the-death-spiral-of-node-inflation/16458/15

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/emergency-proposal-assessing-the-death-spiral-of-node-inflation/16458/22

Where there have been development is on the legal side. The case against Dfinity was torpedoed by the exposure of unethical (not certain if illegal) and definitely dishonest shenanigans by opposing counsel. It turns out, as many here suspected and argued to me (from faith more than evidence) that there was a nefarious, compromised agenda behind the lawsuits for defrauding investors.

https://cryptobriefing.com/daily-briefing-an-avalanche-of-trouble/

Ava Labs, a rival crypto basically colluded with a crypto-focused litigation lawyer (Roche) to sue its competitors at one remove. The goal was not necessarily to win the lawsuits, which was a bonus, but to expose commercially sensitive competitor secrets via legal discovery, which the shadow crypto partner could exploit. Dfinity managed to secure a leaked audio of Roche boasting about this, and the law firm leading the law suit on behalf of the early ICP investors alleged to have been swindled by Dfinity and a couple of VCs, immediately dropped out (September). The hearing on Dfinity's Motion to Dismiss, which contains its defence and explanations, was postponed.

Alas, this says nothing about the actual victims in all this,  or at least the claimants, who were exploited by Dfinity's competitors weaponising their grievances. They have been left without legal representation, but not because the accusations were found to lack evidence or grounds. As I said in my posts, and people are realising more and more, the data to conclude a) market manipulation, and b) Definity insider benefits, is not from an article or a lawsuit, but from all the publicly available numbers that any reader here can verify without intermediaries.

In fact you can now read Dfinity and Williams' defence. 

https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60120124/62/valenti-v-dfinity-usa-research-llc/

And for all the true believers... it's not good. Far from providing evidence against early insider trading, they base their defence on the fact that even if true, the case is not prosecutable on the basis of the prosecution's strategy. 

"even if the allegations in the Complaint are taken as true, it fails to state a claim under Sections
22   12(a)(1) or 15 of the Securities Act".

The document, in an equally legalistic way, says Williams himself did not sell tokens then. But it acknowledges that right when everyone was locked in, the earliest investors and ex-employees could buy and sell freely at peak prices. The fact that this money could still find its way to other pockets, including Williams, is not addressed. Remarkably, in their motion to dismiss they cite a speculative article that likewise makes the point of privileged training by a few at the start. 

Their point is that what happened may not have been fair, may not have been honest, but, it might not be prosecutable under the law as a class action lawsuit. If they win this lawsuit, it won't be because they have been absolved from the charge of insider manipulation and profit, but simply because such manipulation and profit is not covered by a specific securities law. 

The reason why they haven't mounted a stronger defence or denial, is because it's the nature of distributed ledgers to make flows transparent, so there's no hiding or questioning the clearly unethical facts. Whether they are prosecutable or not.

And the same people at the top then, are largely at the top now.

[/quote]

As a lawyer I can tell you that this approach is standard litigation strategy and strongest way to win a motion to dismiss which in this case assumes all allegations as true and attempts to succeed as a matter of law. This means that the plaintiff's case is so weak that even if everything they say is true they still have no legal basis to sue.

Also, providing evidence at this early stage would be a huge mistake and in fact impossible since "evidence" appears only at trial; not during motions. 

Accordingly, there is nothing improper to infer about the defense. Before doing so, you should learn more about how the law works. Plaintiffs have no right to argue nonsense in a court and thereby earn the right to a full factual and ethical discussion of the issues.

There is no "prosecution" by the way; you mean "plaintiff." Prosecution only applies in criminal cases not civil ones. That is one of the most basic distinctions in the law.

Keep us all posted on Kadena - I'd love to hear more about it.

  But what about investors who lost 97% of the value of their investment? Did early investors dump on them like you claim for ICP?

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 13:27:19 UTC | #89

Oh, I should have made clear there is nothing dodgy about the defence itself. It makes sense and if I was being represented, I would wish for something like this. It is simply an observation that, in terms of what I have been discussing, the defence as it stands currently is procedural rather than counterfactual, so, were Dfinity to win its motion to dismiss, it would not mean that manipulation, coin inflation, and privileged trading while 99% of investors were locked out and could only watch, did not happen: just that those facts themselves were not tried. 

Likewise I understand why the defence would want to avoid getting into a factual defense when they could win on a procedural one, particularly given commercially sensitive interests. A successful motion to dismiss could be presented as vindication (even though my point is that it wouldn't be) without having to address the substantive concerns of the plaintiffs (prosecution was a clumsy shorthand and the correction is welcome), or many in the community. Nothing to see here. Definitely best case scenario for Dfinity: we've proven the lawyer who attacked us was a dodgy agent for a commercial rival, and the Court sided with us. End of.

If someone then asks: so did the court establish that you did not engage in ethically dubious, self-enriching, market manupulative action? The answer will be no, but the question will not be heard.

My main point here is nor legal. Did Dfinity and Williams break the law? Above my pay grade. 

Were they dishonest, unethical and extraordinarily self-enriching at the cost of 99% of ICP investors, and profit in obscure yet demonstrable and eye watering ways? Even the supportive evidence Dfinity adduces in its Motion to Dismiss would seem to suggest that.

Is it past history, time to turn the page, and pin our hopes on the Internet Computer to transform society, decentralise and democratise the planet, and make ICP investors wealthy in the process?

With genuine, honest sadness, I think not. One thing is having grave systemic challenges: technological, governance; economic; environmental. If at least you can trust that the people solving them are good and honest actors with the best interests of all at heart, you can hope that brilliance, persistence and commitment will win through, and keep on investing in the "greenhouse" even at a loss, chipping in your hard earned dollars to give a beautiful project a chance. If you then make money on top, that's a bonus. 

That is how I approached the whole thing when I first came across it, even when I spotted a huge number of constraints and challenges.

But when you have a single man sitting atop a pyramid built from soooo many people's losses, when the ledger transactions demonstrate without equivocation that a tiny number of individuals launched Genesis at peak value, a value based on the investments and enthusiasm of a huge range of early adopters, and then sold and made billions while locking out all the investors that drove that very value, and then opened the doors to everyone as the value crashed, not arbitrarily but specifically due to those early transactions, then... well, wishing something to be as good as you know it *could* be, sadly doesn't make it so.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 16:42:04 UTC | #92

Will do! As I say, very early days. I hugely respect and trust @jwiegley who is their new CTO. The technologica vision and team also seem distinctive. Their technological innovations are impressive and there are structural and financial choices that make it seem on the face of it less vulnerable to the structural distortions I've observed in other crypto. But I'm aware that is was a similar first impression from ICP and here I am. So, as I explore Kadena, I approach it like I did ICP: with sympathy, open mindedness, a positive bias toward trust in good faith... and the due diligence to verify. I've only just started. If you have any links about Kadena I should follow, I am very happy and receptive to seeing them, whatever they contain (SFW!)

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 16:58:05 UTC | #93

My understanding so far is that Kadena has not particularly sought to inflate its currency or get big VC money fast. There was a brief speculative bubble that raised then dropped its price back to the baseline. As ever, the professional speculators made lots and the FOMO retail investors lost money. 


But as far as I have been able to gather, there are zero indications the bubble started from within, that the Kadena team profited in any way, or that the bull run changed whatever they were doing before and continued to do through the bull run and beyond. They seem to have a much longer term, systemic focus. They appear notably not to have created the huge first mover concentrations of power in almost every other chain, and they don't have the Crypto VC pressures to inflate and sell. They seem much more ambitious, and much more grounded.

This is, in pretty much every respect, the opposite of ICP Genesis. The speculation was internally driven, the trades were made by insiders, they were made when all investors were locked, and the shifts in valuation map to announcements that Dom himself made. Among the definite beneficiaries were VCs and Dfinity employees with custom contracts and agreements that excluded them from the lock.

Speculative runs happen. Crypto is a gambling casino with a gigantic house advantage. The problem is when the speculative runs are orchestrated by the house, demonstrate trading based on insider knowledge and privileged rights, and are followed by a crash that links to self-enriching trades and statements from a tiny number of first mover oligopolists.

Super happy for any factual data that challenges any of this reading of Kadena. That is what I myself am looking for. But so far, so good. I have concerns on the environmental front, but their innovations on POW are a potential game changer for electricity consumption, and scalability (their USP), so am having a close look before drawing any conclusions.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-11-16 17:25:55 UTC | #94

Is it normal that a former Dfinity employee left the organisation to join Kadena? I'm not that familiar with employee movements in crypto, so not sure what to make of it. I had the same confusion when Andreas Rossberg left Dfinity.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-11-16 17:39:47 UTC | #95

Obviously I have no visibility, but what is usual is that a contract will have time specific non-compete/non-poaching clause. I.e., you can't work for a competitor for x time after leaving, or recruit from our company or business. Once that time has expired, or if the new job is considered to fall outside,  or if agreed between all concerned,  the move is fine. I'm certain on of these three scenarios would have obtained.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-11-16 19:11:34 UTC | #96

I know several former DFINITY employees who now work at other blockchain efforts. I spent almost 4 years at DFINITY, still love the technology, but I like the blockchain concept overall even more and so I wanted to diversify my personal investment of time and energy in the space. There is great social benefit here, once we evolve beyond the speculators and Ponzi schemes — much in the same way that the Internet evolved beyond being a distribution network for "certain types of media".

Kadena is sufficiently different in its approach, and I liked the people working there, that I felt it would be a complimentary addition to my life-investment in blockchain thus far.

Now that I understand both technology stacks fairly well, I can say that rather than competing, they could compliment each other extremely well. If DFINITY's threshold crypto were extended to support ed25519, they could create a native bridge to Kadena the same way that they have with Bitcoin. This would open the door to a hybrid world where DFINITY (whose main strengths are universal compute via WebAssembly, high transaction speeds due to smaller replication factors, vetted node providers at some cost to decentralization) could settle financial and governance transactions through Kadena (who main strengths are stronger consensus (1/2 for Kadena vs. 2/3 for Dfinity), the simplicity of the Bitcoin model, incentivized decentralization due to PoW, scalability via multi-chain — not unlike how Dfinity has multiple subnets — and a solid contract language that is not meant for universal compute the way Wasm is).

We're already getting used to JavaScript on the front-end, Rust on the back-end... The analogy is admittedly a poor one, but it's this sort of hybridization that I've always hoped would become part of the future for blockchain. No one technology is ever going to be the best at all things.

I'm not here to speak about Kadena, though, this is a DFINITY forum — I was just answering a question personally directed at me. If you want to ask questions about Kadena itself on Reddit or our discord, I'd be happy to go into further detail over there.

If I was interested in running a node with the gen 2 hardware that was published on the wiki and I had the means and ways to do so how would I go about contacting dfinity about this. It seems that unlike other chains there are what, 7 approved centers to operate? There should be a streamlined process to allow entities that can provide and operate the hardware to register and being at will.

That is the screen you get while it is downloading the pdf. Check your downloads folder for the doc, it's likely there, or try again, wait a bit then check. I just tried and it worked fine.

Hi @Internationalwaters, you can register any datacenter (DC) that fits the technical requirements, see the procedure here: [VIII. Ensure that your datacenter is registered in the network](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding#VIII._Ensure_that_your_datacenter_is_registered_in_the_network). Any DC already housing IC nodes is very unlikely to run more nodes from another node provider anytime soon.

May I dm you? I am in the process of negotiating w some centers and would like to not be redundant.
