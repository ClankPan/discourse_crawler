Hello !

I am currently playing (locally) with the ledger canister and motoko.

There is an essential question that I ask myself concerning the address of wallet generated after going through an Internet Identity authentication. Is the wallet address unique for each canister / dapp (just like the identity)?

I wanted to see if the wallet address generated (with AccountIdentifier) was compliant for a withdrawal from an exchange and... yes it matches

Actually, to sum up:
- The Internet Identity is different for each canister
- AccountIdentifier generates a different wallet address for each canister

All is correct ?

AccountIdentifier type : https://github.com/dfinity/ledger-ref/blob/3ed0206afd231b9586c9e7b9a793948f10118297/src/Account.mo#L12

Yes. II generates a different principal per user per service authenticated with it. And account IDs are calculated by concatenating a constant string, principal, and subaccount, and SHA-224 hashing the result; the odds of a SHA-224 collision, and thus a duplicate account ID, are about one in two billion.
