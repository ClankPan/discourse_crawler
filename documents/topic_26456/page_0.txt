## **Project highlights**

Our project unleashes the full spectrum of creative potential through advanced AI tools, aimed at democratizing the art of storytelling and filmmaking. Targeted at freelancers, small and medium-sized businesses with marketing needs, and users who find AI tools challenging, our platform serves as an engaging and educational space. We empower individuals to learn and create animations and videos, making high-level filmmaking accessible on a gamified mobile platform.

## **Web3 advantages**

Unlike traditional Web2 educational platforms, our project leverages the decentralization and transparency inherent to Web3. This ensures that all learning content and tools are perpetually available, with no single point of failure. Our platform stands out by integrating open-source advancements for a collaborative and inclusive educational environment, akin to how OpenChat offers a decentralized alternative to WhatsApp.

## **How is it built**

The project is constructed using a combination of programming languages and frameworks, including Rust for blockchain interactions, and leveraging open-source libraries for AI functionalities. An architecture diagram, would illustrate the seamless integration of AI tools, educational content, and user interaction. Our design decisions focus on simplicity, engagement, and scalability, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

Specific features of the Internet Computer, such as its seamless scalability and cost-effective data storage, have been utilized to enhance our platform. These features allow us to offer a continually updated suite of tools and content, providing an ever-evolving learning experience that adapts to the needs of our users.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

Our strategy involves tapping into existing AI communities and leveraging partnerships with educational institutions. We aim to engage users through interactive challenges, community events, and by showcasing the ease with which one can create with AI on our platform. Marketing efforts will focus on demonstrating the transformative learning experience we offer.

## **Monetization**

The project is built with profitability in mind. Monetization will come from a subscription model, with the base starting at 10-25 USD monthly (adjustable according to the cost of living). In the future, we may consider launching a Service Nervous System (SNS) for decentralized governance as part of our strategy.

## **Status of the project**

Currently, our platform is in the advanced stages of development, with a launch anticipated for January 2024. We have successfully built an AI curriculum with 32 learning modules and 200 mini-lessons. We have also closed partnerships with several AI tools that will be consequently integrated, creating a user-friendly interface. Usage metrics and further technical accomplishments will be shared upon the project's release.

## **Future Plans**

Plans include continuous updates to our AI tools, expansion of our educational content, and possibly integrating virtual and augmented reality features. We also aim to attend key tech and education conferences and apply for innovation grants to further our reach and capabilities.

Have you checked out the DeAI Technical Working Group led by @patnorris? I think you should talk to all of the AI projects built on ICP and see if they would help creators.

Hello Jennifer,

Yes I am taking a look at this chat and it's quite interesting to see that they have already started to tackle some challenges arising with decentralized AI. I remember there was also the Beacon Fund back in 2022, is this still open for ICP projects? And, do you recommend we apply?

Best,

Roger Rangel

I would start with the following questions. (They do not need to be answered publicly):

1. What are your fundraising goals? How much are you looking to fundraise? What type of investors are you looking to onboard?
2. Have you received other funding? Who is currently on your cap table?
3. What is your fundraising pitch? It is important to articulate to investors why fundraising is needed at your stage. Also, what are your wins thus far that make you a viable business for investors to invest in? 

I think it would be valuable for you to talk to @radu once you have opened your fundraising round. Ping me on Discord or send me an email through Submittable for any follow-up!
