# About ICTO Project
ICTO is a comprehensive token management platform built on the Internet Computer (IC) blockchain. It addresses the critical need for automated token operations within the IC ecosystem. Our target users are developers and project teams building on IC who require robust tools for token vesting, payroll, locking, and fundraising. ICTO aims to simplify these complex processes, enabling projects to focus on their core development while ensuring transparent and secure token management.

## How is it built

ICTO is built using Motoko as the primary programming language for smart contracts on the Internet Computer blockchain. This choice allows us to leverage the full power of IC's native development environment. For the frontend, we've employed Vue3, a progressive JavaScript framework known for its performance and flexibility in building user interfaces.

#### Our architecture includes:

- **Smart Contract Layer**: Developed in Motoko, handling core token operations
- **User Interface**: Built with Vue3 for a responsive and intuitive frontend experience
- **Integration APIs**: Allows seamless integration with other IC projects

Key design decisions include modular architecture for extensibility and on-chain governance mechanisms for community-driven development.

## Internet Computer superpowers

ICTO leverages several unique features of the Internet Computer:

- **Canister Smart Contracts**: Enables complex token operations with high efficiency
- **Internet Identity**: Provides secure and user-friendly authentication
- **Cycles for Computation**: Highlights the extremely cost-effective data storage and processing on the Internet Computer
- **Chain-key Cryptography**: Enhances security in multi-signature operations
- **Inter-canister Communication**: Utilizes the flexibility of connections between canisters through Actors, allowing contracts to manage and cross-connect with each other

These features allow ICTO to offer a seamless user experience while maintaining high levels of security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Status of the project

ICTO has made significant progress in both development and recognition within the IC ecosystem:

- We have been awarded a Dfinity Developer Grant and are currently completing the final milestone. This grant has been instrumental in accelerating our development and validating our project's potential.
- Our product is now live and operational at[ https://icto.app](https://icto.app). Users can already access and utilize key features including:
  * **Token deployment**
Easily create and launch custom tokens on the Internet Computer using ICTO's deployment feature. Configure token details, leverage the official ICRC standard, and rapidly integrate your token into the expanding IC ecosystem

  * **Token locks**
  Seal your commitment to the project by visibly locking liquidity. Unlike burning tokens (hard to track), lock them securely for added transparency and trust. Ideal for token sales, ensuring fair distribution and milestone-based releases.

  * **Claim contract**
  The Claim Contract enables the most efficient distribution of tokens to users. It can be utilized for various purposes, including:

    > Payroll management
    > Linear token release
    > Airdrops
    > Vesting schedules
    > Instant unlocks

    This versatile feature allows projects to set up customized token distribution plans tailored to their specific needs. Whether it's regular salary payments, gradual token releases, community rewards, or investor vesting schedules, the Claim Contract provides a flexible and automated solution. Users can claim their allocated tokens based on predefined conditions, ensuring a transparent and trustless distribution process. This functionality significantly streamlines token management tasks for projects while offering a seamless experience for token recipients.

- **Launchpad:** 
Creating a robust launchpad that will **compete favourably** with SNS launchpad and also help to protect the interest of investors through trustless coding. We are in the final stages of developing our Launchpad feature, which we anticipate launching at the beginning of next month (July). This addition will significantly expand ICTO's capabilities and offer even more value to our users.

This progress demonstrates our commitment to delivering a robust, user-friendly token management solution for the Internet Computer ecosystem. We're excited about the upcoming launch of our Launchpad feature and continue to welcome feedback from our early users to refine and improve ICTO.
