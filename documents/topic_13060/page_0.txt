There would be lots of benefits if Motoko canisters had an "EEPROM" versioning action that could by default be enabled and public (that would increment every time there was a pair of successful pre and post callbacks to an upgrade call) unless there is already something, that has to be manually exposed?

The use case being for instance, inter canister calls in the case you don't know the rest of the network that might be calling on you.

There is a giant discussion post on this on the github as well...I'll try to find it, but if you searching for upgrade versioning you should find it.
