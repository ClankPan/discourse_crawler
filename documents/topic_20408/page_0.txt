Assuming there is one, what's the tool again that helps deserialize the output of a failing `post_upgrade` message?

I'm trying to debug my branch locally and got a long `post_upgrade` error msg. Pretty sure that if I would be able to transform all these these numbers in their textual representation, even if not structured, I would find what's my problem.

Nevermind, I found out the issue by looking at my code for the 100th times 😉.

That said, for future reference, if anyone knows the answer, might be interesting.

These numbers are candid encoded message, it is possible to decode it, however without specs you will get numbers instead of property names

I should be possible to decode without the did files using [didc](https://github.com/dfinity/candid).

Assuming I would have saved the Candid string from the `post_upgrade` hook in a file e.g. `hello.txt`, I could have decoded it with following script:

```
#!/bin/bash
value=$(<hello.txt)
didc decode "$value"
```
