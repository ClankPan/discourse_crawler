When setting up the `sns_init.yaml` there is the option to specify a `vesting_period` for a neuron, this means that the vesting period needs to be over before a neuron can be dissolved.

Is it possible to set the `vesting_period` for neurons created after the SNS swap? I can't find any reference for it so i assume its not possible, but i want to be sure.

You are right, this can currently only be set for the initial neurons and not after the SNS has been launched. For every neuron created after lauch, the relevant neuron field will be set to "none".

The reason for this is that this was introduced to allow vesting periods of initial neurons, for example developer neurons that should have a smaller dissolve delay in order not to have too much voting power, but still be committed to the DAO for longer.
