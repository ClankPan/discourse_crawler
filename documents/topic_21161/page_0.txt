I was playing around with `dfx` and setting up a new identity and cycle wallet. I tried out the `dfx quickstart` command but was stopped by an error. 

```
% dfx quickstart

```

However after running `dfx identity --network ic set-wallet ohn6u-5qaaa-aaaal-acraq-cai` and verifying that the wallet had a wasm installed, I was able to get my balance.  My question is: **does someone has an idea why I did got the error in the 1st place?** 

For information here is the full log.

You need 3.24675325 more ICP to deploy a 10 TC wallet canister on mainnet.
Deposit at least 3.24675325 ICP into the address c30ccf838855d92ed7257179bcee87d8c33a9a2e4804ddca452fe642d032e4b1, and then run this command again, to deploy a mainnet wallet.

Alternatively:
- If you have ICP in an NNS account, you can create a new canister through the NNS interface
- If you have a Discord account, you can request free cycles at https://faucet.dfinity.org
Either of these options will ask for your DFX user principal, listed above.
And either of these options will hand you back a wallet canister principal; when you run the command again, select the 'import an existing wallet' option.

  Wallet not configured.
    Diagnosis was added here.
Error explanation:
This command requires a configured wallet, but the combination of identity 'd8x-frontend' and network 'ic' has no wallet set.
How to resolve the error:
To use an identity with a configured wallet you can do one of the following:
- Run the command for a network where you have a wallet configured. To do so, add '--network <network name>' to your command.
- Switch to an identity that has a wallet configured using 'dfx identity use <identity name>'.
- Configure a wallet for this identity/network combination: 'dfx identity set-wallet <wallet id> --network <network name>'.
- Or, if you're using mainnet, and you haven't set up a wallet yet: 'dfx quickstart'.
% dfx identity --network ic set-wallet ohn6u-5qaaa-aaaal-acraq-cai

That's really weird. Let me ask round...

Should be fixed in [#3219](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3219).
