Hi, Given that we have two methods for custody/transfer of ICP tokensâ€¦.

1. Self-custody via Keysmith in conjunction with [DFINITY Canister SDK](https://github.com/dfinity/keysmith#integration-with-the-dfinity-canister-sdk).
2. Using Internet Identity in conjunction with NNS Application

Which is relatively safe from security standpoint ?
