Hello everyone,
I have made the canister. The wasm file of the frontend has been uploaded in it, now I want to see it, where can I see it? any link? 
In which url my website is running?
In which url my html will be rendered and seen?
how to deploy client side (frontend) with wasm.
I want to connect frontend and backend via wasm then how to connect?
would be cool if we could just deploy a web app both front end and backend canister with wasm at once.

Hey there, I recommend you have a look at our [quickstart](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/deploy_sample_app) tutorial, which covers the basics of deployment.

If this is not detailed enough for you, I recommend you continue reading [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/frontend/).

The typical way (and also in the links I posted earlier) is to use something like [@dfinity/agent](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/agents/javascript-intro) to do the calls to the backend canister and then host the frontend in the asset canister like the beginner tutorials show.
