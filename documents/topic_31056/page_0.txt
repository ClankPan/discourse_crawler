Hi all,

I'd like to build something subscription-based. In other words, I'd like the users of my app to be able to grant it access to transfer N icp tokens every month. 

A lot of web2 services are subscription-based, but is this technically possible at the moment on the IC? If it is, would anyone mind sharing some links, sample codes, documentation, anything.

Thanks!

With [icrc2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md) standard and icp [timer](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/periodic-tasks) its easy task to do on icp already!
