How can I check that this neuron now follows dfinity neuron ID 27:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2511989001097450386

It is a DAO managed neuron.

You can only see the followees if you are the controller or a hotkey of the neuron. I'd say add yourself as hotkey and query it from DFX?

This is the information the dashboard is **allowed to query**:

```
  public type NeuronInfo = {
    dissolve_delay_seconds : Nat64;
    recent_ballots : [BallotInfo];
    created_timestamp_seconds : Nat64;
    state : Int32;
    stake_e8s : Nat64;
    joined_community_fund_timestamp_seconds : ?Nat64;
    retrieved_at_timestamp_seconds : Nat64;
    known_neuron_data : ?KnownNeuronData;
    voting_power : Nat64;
    age_seconds : Nat64;
  };
```

You can spot check manually to determine when the neuron votes compared to when DFINITY votes.  Or run an automation every 15 minutes to check the voting result of both.  There is an ic-api that can be used or you can query the governance canister directly.  As @dfxjesse said, Followee configuration is private neuron info, so you have to periodically interrogate voting patterns to assess the Followee configuration.
