Kinic is preparing to launch its SNS DAO.

Please read the Kinic DAO [white paper ](https://74iy7-xqaaa-aaaaf-qagra-cai.raw.ic0.app/whitepaper). 
Please add any questions, suggestions, or general discussions in this post.

**Project description**

* Kinic is the first search engine that indexes front-end content hosted on blockchain. It is an information API and discovery tool.

* User requested features have ruled most of the roadmap up until now. Things like "I would love access to this data", or "how do I improve ranking?". Kinic won in its category in Supernova and the team has been working purely off those funds. **If we want open sourced community grown products like Kinic to be able to compete in the thriving data analytics and search space, we need resources.** Users are asking for the features, and we want to be able to build them effectively.

**Roadmap**
* Expand analytics API and add frontends running on multiple chains.
* 'Old-fashioned search' will be overcome by AI driven search models. Kinic will lead this space with verifiable ZKML. 

**Syndication**

We have reviewed the white-paper with multiple parties and it has been public for over 10 days.
On April 27th we will be closing all edits and creating the SNS configuration and proposal to match the white paper.

Kinic is a utility and governance token. Early backers such as CrowdFund NFT holder should be able to utilise their tokens. In the white-paper you will find that these people have 1/3 of their neurons with no vesting and the other 2/3 locked for vesting. 

You will also find that there is no 'developer team' portion in the whitepaper. This is because the developer team is passing all rights and ownership to a future Kinic development organization (NPO), with the mandate of promoting and developing Kinic. Many projects in the web3 space use the option to make NPO, and we think that is the best structure for grant funding and general growth; Dfinity is one such example.

**Funding target**

* 500,000 ICP minimum to 1,500,000 ICP maximum as detailed in our white paper. 
* The first proposal will be for data API and DB work. The core team of developers is currently two people but we plan on adding more to be truly competitive. A primary goal is to attract all of the web3 space into hosting their front-ends on-chain rather than on cloud servers.

**Community fund (CF) contribution**

Kinic will seek to sell 4.2% (250,000) to the Internet Computer’s Community Fund.

**Decentralization & voting power**

This is in the white paper in great detail.

**Security aspects**

Kinic is a consumer facing dApp with no access to sensitive user data. All aspects of Kinic DAO will be open-sourced and publicly viewable. The front-end has been open-sourced on Github since Supernova. The backend search canister will be open sourced after we conclude our discussions with CanDB, and before the SNS proposal is submitted.

Hello! 

Thank you very much for this. We are looking at your White paper as well. Very interesting. Wish you all the best!

Can you please let me know who was helping your team with SNS?

Hi,

Which portion? There are lots of technical things done and documents to be made and reviewed. The technical portions have been done by the dev team. This seems appropriate for a DM rather than a forum discussion as it depends on your team and your project.

Whatever the case, I'll be rooting for you.

Thank you. 

We are started our journey in IC ecosystem and working on product and grant. As we was running DAOs previously on another network, there was an idea to build the "open community case for SNS" when all the process from the idea, concept building to implementation are happening in real time (can participate or just observe) as an open and transparent process for all community, making all the templates, documents, masterclasses, etc done with the help of community members to the whole IC ecosystem. So later any team can use this case as an example.

This is very exciting, thanks for sharing your whitepaper.

> Kinic has processes set up for indexing using scripts that anyone can run.

Could you elaborate on what difficulties you had getting this functionality on chain?

> Third parties can purchase the ability to call the Kinic search API with KINIC tokens.

Is this a one time payment or a subscription service? What kind of integrations do you think will leverage this and do you have any prospective users?

> Creators can claim a site via the Twitter @kinic_app

Do you have any plans to decentralize this better? What is the DFX command that is given to you to claim the site?

Thank you!
> Kinic has processes set up for indexing using scripts that anyone can run.
`Could you elaborate on what difficulties you had getting this functionality on chain?`

This part does not need to be on-chain as anyone can run the scripts from anywhere. It gathers canisters that have not been indexed yet and makes a list. It checks whether a canister has been indexed yet, if not it is added to the list. 


> Third parties can purchase the ability to call the Kinic search API with KINIC tokens.

They will be paying for usage. This is not set up yet. But it will be xyz amount of tokens based on a call. Internal search is a big one. So blogging sites and social have shown strong interest in this. Outside of that anyone who is interested in ICP data.
> 
> Creators can claim a site via the Twitter @kinic_app

After you login you can see step-by-step directions. 
```
dfx canister --network ic call 73j6l-2iaaa-aaaaf-qagrq-cai requestVerifyContentOwner '(principal "HERE")'
```
Motoko does not have a way to get canister Owner info. So there is a script that needs to be called that accepts all of the requests.. also this can be run from anyone.. anywhere. The best solution, is to get canister owner = caller and call it a day. We will look into this again before launch! Let us know if you think there is another way / or this has been added to Motoko.

So is the idea that if it doesn't need to be on-chain, that it's not? There's no other reason?

> It checks whether a canister has been indexed yet, if not it is added to the list.

Could you elaborate a bit more on this? Since it's not open source yet there's no context and it's difficult to understand exactly how it's working. Is that "list" something that lives in your canister?

> Internal search is a big one. So blogging sites and social have shown strong interest in this. 

So a blog would pay to have Kinic search it's own content? Why would a site use this over a free solution like [flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) where they can index during the build step and then query the index with a worker at runtime? What's the advantage that Kinic offers to justify the paid service?

> After you login you can see step-by-step directions.

Maybe I misunderstood the Whitepaper. From reading the directions it looks like someone could claim their own canister without contacting you on Twitter and that's only there if they need support?

Minimum number of KINIC tokens that can be staked in a neuron: 4. 1 KINIC cost is planned to 1 ICP. Distributed in 5 neurons. Did distribution of neurons is possible with these sale configuration parameters?

Edit: I mean the minimum threshold of participation in the sale of 1 ICP.
I suggest changing the minimum neuron stake in the initial configuration to 0.1 KINIC, because even when purchased for 1 ICP, it gives 0.2 KINIC per neuron + small transfer fee (0.001 KINIC per neuron)!

[quote="NathanosDev, post:9, topic:19553"]
So is the idea that if it doesn’t need to be on-chain, that it’s not? There’s no other reason?
[/quote]

In this case it is better that it is not on-chain. 

1. The indexer needs to be able to scrape the Internet (HTTPs feature helps but does not beat out scrapping tools with 8+ years of real world usage). The indexers need to be nimble. Anyone can modify the script and run it from anywhere they like; It needs to reach a specific format for it to be put into the on-chain DB.This should not be pending on an SNS voting process each time an optmial indexing procedure is realized.

2. Kinic DAO is not passive. Members are responsible for the workings of the DAO. If they see a canister that is not yet indexed they have the power and responsibility to index it. Many people know Javascript, therefore many people can run the indexer scripts.

3. In the future, more indexers can be made for cross-chain support, off-chain support, AI model testing and more. Anyone can do this without asking permission. Nimble is better here.

> Could you elaborate a bit more on this? Since it’s not open source yet there’s no context and it’s difficult to understand exactly how it’s working. Is that “list” something that lives in your canister?

We have a DB (CanDB) with all of the canisters that have front-ends. The script only allows for people to append to this database. i.e. in the db we could have [a,b,c] items. The next time the script is ran, it checks that [a,b,c] exist, and if it finds 'd' it adds it to the DB.

> Internal search is a big one. So blogging sites and social have shown strong interest in this.

This is a long standing user requested feature. Flexsearch does not work on-chain and also does not index on-chain content. So to achieve what we do with Kinic they would basically need to rebuild Kinic and add Flexsearch as their in-site specific indexer. After that they would need do design a ICP specific datastore for the index data, and port Flexsearch to work in a canister. ElasticSearch could also work for this if someone wanted to build a system from scratch.

[Nuance](https://nuance.xyz/) was the first to request this. You can see what they do now. If any site could use the same procedure and algorithms to get the best content on-top, it remove endlessly recreating the wheel on a team by team basis.

> Maybe I misunderstood the Whitepaper. From reading the directions it looks like someone could claim their own canister without contacting you on Twitter and that’s only there if they need support?

Right now there is no way for Motoko to check the owner of a canister. 
1. The user makes a DFX request saying 'Hey, I own this.'
2. Someone checks that indeed the person saying 'Hey, I own this' is the correct owner of the canister. With the DAO any member will be able to do this, in place of the former Kinic team. Kinic DAO is not passive; members are involved in the process of running the DAO.

*Future, the moment this is possible in Motoko, it will simply check the code and no one will need to call the script anymore.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-04-24 21:05:19 UTC | #13

So the bulk of indexing is actually done off-chain? How do you prevent people from falsifying the indexed content that's uploaded to the canister?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-04-24 21:11:28 UTC | #14

It needs to be in a specific format. 

It has constraints: be a not yet indexed canister, most of the data points are verifiable facts (canister id, data response length, etc). It is 'mostly' a deterministic process. 

We could add a ZKP that gives a proof that the script was run correctly and host that proof on-chain. But this just simply saves another user's time to rerun the script, as if A does not match B, the corrupted data is updated with the correct deterministically indexed data.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-04-24 21:14:48 UTC | #15

Is the deterministic output verified at any point? If I just run this script now could I not just swap out keywords for a canister?

Once a canister is indexed, can it no longer be re-indexed?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-04-24 21:18:20 UTC | #16

There are special cases where it needs to be removed / re-indexed.

a. bad or false data. 
b. fraud sites and phishing sites.

Even if 'indexing' was hosted on-chain someone could read the source code and game the system. With a DAO we have multiple interested parties who can 'flag' content. If we reach a flag threshold, a canister can be re-indexed, overwritten, or removed all together.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-04-24 21:19:49 UTC | #17

Understood, thank you for taking the time to answer my questions and best of luck with your sale :pray:

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-04-24 21:21:42 UTC | #18

Not a problem. If you want to discuss elsewhere (public Space, or not) we can go really deep into the weeds on this! It will be the best possible process we can think off for SNS.

Such bad search results and experience, how dare you raise 1,500,000 ICP on SNS? LOL.

Search "internet computer" on Kinic and Google... I can't find the information I want on Kinic.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-04 06:58:18 UTC | #21

The point here is to have a DAO that improves itself to be able to compete and win against web2... not to use established web2 services that put web3 results on the bottom; or even out right ban them.

Hey @pphaolu, [**Querio**](https://querio.io/) search engine is live! We would greatly appreciate if you could try it out and provide your feedback or suggestions on our post on Dfinity's [**forum**](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/pphaolu).

Without a good user experience, what can you do to compete? It's been almost a year since Kinic has made any major updates. Same feeling of experience as last year during hackathon. kinic indexes all the front-end canister and then does the search. Just indexing regardless of results right? I don't know if you guys understand what the nature of search is or not? Do search without sorting algorithm？？？lol

-------------------------

pphaolu | 2023-05-05 05:35:24 UTC | #26

Hi, andreea.  
My friends and I have tested Querio.
Pros: neat interface, fast
Cons: The same problem as Kinic, search results are almost never considered with sorting algorithms or weights. Makes it hard for users to find the actual content they want. For example, search for "Internet Computer". BTW, I can't get any results for "querio" in Querio.

-------------------------

pphaolu | 2023-05-05 05:39:36 UTC | #27

We respect all developers. But your project is rushing to the SNS to be tested, which involves millions of icp. with all due respect, Kinic's valuation is too high.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-05 05:44:44 UTC | #28

Hi!

I understand what your saying. You want your search engine to be as good as a 30 yead-old multi-billion dollar web2 version right? That is great!! Let's build it together via open-source, community driven, 100% on-chain manner. We have some really cool ideas in the roadmap for ZKML and more.

> BTW, I can’t get any results for “querio” in Querio.

Hard to use an on-chain app search engine to find something off-chain.

It is fair to compare.. but we all need to work on the opensource web3 DB to make those features better.

Or you get issues like you mentioned and more..

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-05 06:04:19 UTC | #30

The SNS locks ICP into a treasury. It is not like the devs or anyone else gets to take it and run away with it. It simply allows development to be able to make requests to a DAO so that things can speed up.

It seems like you are proposing nothing gets funded on web3.

Edit and add: The range for Kinic is 500,000 to 1,500,000 or $3,000,000 ~ $9,000,000 at $6/ICP.
This matches closely to what a web2 startup gets during seeds or crowdfunds.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-05 08:49:52 UTC | #31

Hi @pphaolu and thanks for testing out [**Querio**](https://querio.io/)! 

Our primary goal was to give the community a needed tool that actually works, so Querio is not yet on-chain. As we speak we’re working on transferring Querio code on-chain. Our vision for Querio is to evolve into a cross-chain web3 search engine, by expanding the scope of its searches to cover other blockchains.

We’ll soon publish the whitepaper and roadmap, where you’ll find all the details. We’ll announce it on the forum when the time comes.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-05 10:56:25 UTC | #32

Stop spamming subjective judgment statements here. 

'actually works' he just said:

Since you are 100% off-chain you could just pay a cloud search service to do the API. That is the trivial part.

Hey Guys,
Happy to be here in the discussion.
Do you know if there is a comparison available that covers the technological advancements, competence, user base, and experience of KINIC and QUERIO?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-05 11:43:25 UTC | #35

I think there is not yet. But even so, I expect both to improve rapidly.

It is not quite apple to apples at the moment as one uses open-source web3 technology that runs on-chain, and that anyone can use and contribute to - [Candb](https://github.com/canscale/CanDB)

The other - probably AWS xyz search API or something like that. Actually comparing stacks would also be interesting. Kinic uses Vue - CanDB and the Internet Computer blockchain.

-------------------------

Thank you for your feedback. I think it is quite clear where 'search' in general is going - ML based models. But ML models do not currently run on-chain, and even if they did how would you trust the code was executed correctly? Or trust that the input data was not collected and mis-used — what about private inputs?

In the roadmap we have written about Zero-knowledge Machine Learning. This is a verifiable machine learning type that is quite suited for the Kinic use-case.

The Kinic Developer Organisation is well suited for this task and it is far reaching outside of the scope of just the IC - or 'indexing other blockchain'. As applications of on-chain ZKML are imperative for the future of blockchain applications.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-05-05 13:17:26 UTC | #41

I agree with your current work and roadmap! At the same time, I will participate in SNS! But the current situation seems unfavorable, for the success of SNS, of course, including my own investment success! I think it is necessary for you to make some changes before SNS launch, let users see what querio can do, you can do it, and at the same time you are better than his, even if some are not in WEB3

For Information - I asked a burning question here :: https://twitter.com/2vxsx_fae/status/1658788196795203593 

Still waiting to hear how they are proving that all the necessary licences are paid for. Being honest - for me Kinic isn't a good candidate for SNS launch. Too many off chain dependencies and human input needed to keep the cogs turning. It leaves me wondering what SNS will actually control?

I wish the team the best of luck. Keep building, keep your heart strong!

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-05-18 14:50:16 UTC | #49

I did not initiate the discussion. 

Rather, it was Kinic who first expressed their opinion on [Querio](https://querio.io/)'s topic. 

Therefore, my response was merely a form of reciprocation.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-05-18 23:38:55 UTC | #50

‪Kinic has signed a licensing agreement with the Origyn foundation to satisfy the terms of the license for a decentralization sale.‬ 

It is transferable to the Kinic DAO after the SNS is complete.

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-21 12:02:35 UTC | #55

Given Kinic is a search engine, responsible for valuable user data, will Kinic be held to the same scrutiny regarding an audit as other applications have been?

Data is subjectively as vulnerable and valuable as funds held within a DeFi Protocol - and past data leaks have shown could even lead to more consequential outcomes. 

Hoping with that being said, we’re holding everyone to the same expectation of user security.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-21 12:53:56 UTC | #56

Kinic holds no user data.

It collects information about on-chain frontends, clicks to those frontends, and when desired advertising information for the owners of the canisters. 

*It does not work with tracking cookies, nor do we use Analytics or other such tracking software.

'responsible for valuable user data'
Can you explain what you mean here if the above did not address it?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-21 13:01:05 UTC | #57

That clears it up for the most part, however I’m more so referring to the contents of user searches; I can’t see your searches, you can’t see mine.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-21 13:18:50 UTC | #58

Kinic does not store that information — at all. 

This does bring up an interesting future point when Kinic moves to an ML based model.
The inputs ('user searches') can be made private with ZKML. Right now there are a lot of issues arising as people use ChatGPT etc, and do not realize they are exposing their companies private information.

The Kinic roadmap is targeted towards pushing the boundary for what is possible with not only on-chain A.I., but privacy oriented A.I. as well.

What about this clauses in license?
So you are liable for 50K and 1% tokens to canDB?
 
**"The Software is free to use for commercial purposes, provided that the Commercial Entity meets the following requirements:**

**5.1 The Commercial Entity has less than 1 million US dollars in cumulative revenue.**

**5.2 The Commercial Entity has a valuation of less than 10 million US dollars as assessed by an independent auditor.**

**5.3 The Commercial Entity has not issued more than 20% of the total tokens or shares in a decentralization sale or public offering.**

**6. Commercial License for Qualifying Entities**

**Commercial Entities that want to use the Software after reaching the qualification threshold must purchase a license agreement in one of the following manners:**

**6.1 Pay one time, $50,000 USD cash before the qualifying event.**

**6.2 Issue 1% of the total tokens or shares in the public offering or successful decentralization sale must be issued to the Licensor as part of the offering. Any restrictions on the tokens should match those offered to other seed funders of the organization/DAO."**

[quote="apotheosis, post:1, topic:19553"]
You will also find that there is no ‘developer team’ portion in the whitepaper. This is because the developer team is passing all rights and ownership to a future Kinic development organization (NPO), with the mandate of promoting and developing Kinic. Many projects in the web3 space use the option to make NPO, and we think that is the best structure for grant funding and general growth; Dfinity is one such example.
[/quote]

Hello, is there an approximate timeline or triggering event for when the project will move to an NPO? Is it possible after the SNS launches that the DAO votes NOT to move to an NPO model? Is there a plan on where to base the NPO?

With that said, even though there is a plan to move to an NPO, is there a reason no one wants to take credit for the work put into creating Kinic? It seems like a running theme in Web3 where people ask for millions of dollars, but don't want to put their names out there. This might be the norm for VC's with money to burn, but from a small retail investor perspective, it just makes me wonder if the people creating the next new thing are the same people who just rugged investors on the last new thing.

Kinic has configured the SNS to grant the tokens to the ORIGYN Foundation to satisfy the license if successful.

Hi,

"It seems like a running theme in Web3 where people ask for millions of dollars, but don’t want to put their names out there."

The DAO treasury is not accessible by the creators directly, everything depends on a vote.. so there is really no way to 'rug'. The majority of the DAO can vote against any funding requests at any time. 

If you visit the Github repo you can see everyone who has ever helped create Kinic. Most use their real names.. those names are very much 'out there' 😉 


'project will move to an NPO' The project is not moving to an NPO.. Kinic is becoming a DAO. There will be a promotion and supportive developer entity called 'The Kinic Developer Organization'. The timing of this depends on a lot of factors.. but the core devs work in any case.

*It is the same model as Dfinity with ICP. Many projects in the space have a supportive research and developer NPO organised around a protocol.

I understand there's no real way to "rug" per se, but your team could get funding and then just say f*#k it, and stop development/voting, or participating in the project. That's also why I was curious about who the devs are.

From their whitepaper:: Scripts for finding sites and ranking them. I'm sure that's not critical for a search engine

Kinic is an on-chain service. It currently has the following off-chain dependencies:

1. Ownership of the https://kinic.io/ domain name that has been pre-paid up to May 2024. Kinic will transfer to an alternative on-chain solution as soon as practical.
2. Scripts used for finding new sites and ranking them. Ranking is based on various factors such as meta data, social handles, and reputation. There are some subjective ranking values that can be given to token holders to determine in a democratic way.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-25 00:22:40 UTC | #66

Thank you for your interest and comments.

1. A domain can be set by anyone with a cname record. Kinic.io has been pre-purchased for 2 years. The Kinic Developer Organization has access to renew.

2. This is discussed in detail above. Moreover, a community dev has recently started extending the script to work on-chain with a HTTP request; there are still a few details that need to be worked on that.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-05-26 10:04:13 UTC | #67

Well how to put this in a non offensive way, but scripts ??? extending scripts ??? does anyone know the definition of a script nowadays ?

apotheosis | 2023-05-25 14:52:58 UTC | #68

This is a confusing post. You have a dislike for scripts and code? 

Sorry but I have to use more technical terms here. 'Reproducible builds' have been created and are being tested now. If these terms are not immediately clear to anyone, please use chatGPT or similar to look them up, thank you.

This GH readme has some shell scripts (things that you run in your terminal to automate processes with code), devs are testing on different OS 'platforms' and CPU (not going to define each technical thing I say).

@apotheosis I have a question with respect to burning KINIC tokens. In the white paper you mention
* KINIC tokens can only be burned by proposal.
* The burn rate will start at 0.125% of total supply until it becomes greater than the reward rate (increasing by a factor of 1.37 each year).

Could you kindly elaborate on this ? For example it would be great to understand
1. The process through which the DAO  would decide on burning tokens.
2. The criteria for selecting which tokens to burn (I assume they would need to belong to the treasury) 
3. The basis on which future (projected) burn rates were calculated.

Many thanks in advance !

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-05-30 16:06:54 UTC | #70

P.S. It would be also great if you share the planned SNS init file in this thread, so that people can review (apologies if I missed it earlier).

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-05-30 16:34:57 UTC | #71

P.P.S. (sorry for the spam). 
The last sentence in the white paper is "Tokenholders that fail to stake their KINIC tokens and engage in voting for a reasonable time are subject to having their tokens repurchased by the DAO." 
Could you kindly elaborate what this means precisely ?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-30 17:08:44 UTC | #72

This wording was put in for some localities where 'active' DAO membership is needed.. practically the DAO could possibly vote to repurchase tokens for non-active token holders. i.e. a token holder does not stake but holds tokens for three years, the DAO could have a vote to purchase those tokens as the member could be deemed 'inactive' in certain localities.

Personally, I would believe that there are other legitimate use cases for token holders which do not involve voting & staking. It might be interesting to get further views from the community (in particular interested swap participants) on this topic.

Indeed! Ultimately this would be decided by the community DAO members with relevant information at the time.

> 1. The process through which the DAO would decide on burning tokens.

**This would have to come through a proposal like anything else.**
The tokens that are used for search and API features may return to the treasury or be burned.

> 2. The criteria for selecting which tokens to burn (I assume they would need to belong to the treasury)

> 3. The basis on which future (projected) burn rates were calculated.

These are also subject to proposals and voting. They would come from the treasury, likely captured by the search API usage or other KINIC features.

The projected weights were used to show an offset of the reward rate. This too is subject to a proposal.

bjoernek | 2023-05-31 10:52:04 UTC | #77

Many thanks for your swift feedback, @apotheosis. To better communicate my thoughts and queries, I have consolidated them into a single post.

I would like to preface this by saying that I find Kinic to be an intriguing dapp, and a highly beneficial addition to the Internet Computer ecosystem. My aim is to gain a better understanding of this dapp, as well as the plans for the SNS launch. This post contains my thoughts and does not represent any official stance on behalf of DFINITY. I aspire to create transparency without casting any judgments on right or wrong.

My feedback is grouped into four areas: Burning of tokens, machine learning, unstaked tokens and further sources of DAO revenue.

**Burning of Tokens:**
In your whitepaper, you note that KINIC tokens can be used for example for API calls or ad purchases, with the profits channeled to the SNS treasury. The SNS could then opt to burn tokens via proposal.
*Question 1:* Could you kindly confirm which paid features are currently available and which ones are planned for imminent addition? Also, do you have a tentative pricing model in mind?

You project a development of the total supply, assuming the burn rate will be 0.125% of the total supply in the first year, increasing to 3% of total supply after ten years.
*Question 2:* Could you elaborate in more detail on the rationale for these figures? For example, it would be helpful to understand the projected user base or API calls, as this, combined with target pricing, would offer transparency on the expected fee volume.

**Machine Learning:**
The executive summary of the whitepaper highlights that "Kinic’s SEO module will feature unparalleled transparency supported by zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) technology."
As this appears to be a crucial element of Kinic’s vision and roadmap, gaining a better understanding of the proposed approach and the current development stage would be beneficial.
*Question 3:* Could you detail the intended approach and highlight the current availability of these features (for instance, as a prototype)?"

**Unstaked Tokens:**
The whitepaper asserts that "Tokenholders that fail to stake their KINIC tokens and participate in voting for a reasonable time are subject to having their tokens repurchased by the DAO.” Yet, as I previously mentioned in this thread, I believe there are other valid uses for token holders that do not involve voting and staking.
*Question 4:* Could you further elaborate on the vision for the Kinic SNS? Specifically, do you foresee that token holders will always stake tokens at some point, implying it will not be permissible to hold liquid tokens for an extended period?

**Further sources of DAO Revenue:**
Your whitepaper states that "The Kinic DAO also earns ICP if the DAO stakes its ICP into a neuron on the Network Nervous System (NNS) and earns voting rewards.” I think this is not possible on the NNS. In particular, a canister is not allowed to be the controller of an NNS neuron. 
*Question 5:* Could you clarify your plans regarding this?

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-05-31 13:54:04 UTC | #78

I would like to also preface by saying that Kinic may soon be a DAO, everything is up for member discussion and a vote after that. The following is an opinion and the projected roadmap is not a certainty. 

[quote="bjoernek, post:77, topic:19553"]
*Question 1:* Could you kindly confirm which paid features are currently available and which ones are planned for imminent addition? Also, do you have a tentative pricing model in mind?
[/quote]

Within the first quarter the Kinic Developer Organization has plans to request changes to the API for usage to be payed for with KINIC. Various pricing models will be subject to a DAO vote coupled with the changes for the paid API. This will likely start out 'very inexpensive' and increase as time goes on.

[quote="bjoernek, post:77, topic:19553"]
*Question 2:* Could you elaborate in more detail on the rationale for these figures? For example, it would be helpful to understand the projected user base or API calls, as this, combined with target pricing, would offer transparency on the expected fee volume.
[/quote]

These numbers were generated with a spreadsheet provided by Dfinity. **No one can predict the future, least of all economists.** The figures suggest lower usage with increasing usage as time goes by. The rational is that more and better paid features are created over time. The initial features will be for what is being used now; the 'search API'. But the DAO could add web2 data, cross-chain data, in-site data (search Nuance only data for example from within Nuance) and much more. IMO the 'burn rate' projections are soft numbers that the DAO should achieve, while total utility rate will be much higher.

[quote="bjoernek, post:77, topic:19553"]
*Question 3:* Could you detail the intended approach and highlight the current availability of these features (for instance, as a prototype)?"
[/quote]

All of search has ML as a crucial component. Kinic was incubated at ICME. ICME has a very strong research and development team around zero-knowledge technologies and machine learning. If you want to read about the open-sourced efforts ICME is focusing on, I direct you to their public blog. https://blog.icme.io/

That being said, I will likely be one person making this proposal in the future.

There are three main privacy use-case for ZKML.

1. Private inputs (no more disclosing private company search to openML).
2. Private weights. (sometimes ML weights are expensive to compute and companies want to keep these private).
3. Private models.

Morever there is a "verifiable computation" use-case of ZKML. 

Currently, their is a strong trust assumption in any ML app. One types in a prompt and a response is returned. Your data is collected, the model could be a different model that advertised or a person in a room typing responses. Verifiable computation via ZKP removes all trust assumptions as the Verifier will reject any deviation in the proof. As Dom once said "Math is not hackable".

Kinic should bring these capabilities 100% on-chain for the benefit of many :)

More specifically, a future proposal will request integrating a ZKWasm instance that leverages 'folding techniques', with advanced lookup arguments which circumvent previous issues in ZK floating point / quantization and efficiency. I expect to see this in late Fall. 

ML powered search is going to out-perform traditional SEO and Kinic is prepared to accel in the near term. ZKML is a high impact area both of research and VC funding currently. Kinic DAO has a good chance at becoming the 'DAO' envy of the world in this area 😊 

[quote="bjoernek, post:77, topic:19553"]
*Question 4:* Could you further elaborate on the vision for the Kinic SNS? Specifically, do you foresee that token holders will always stake tokens at some point, implying it will not be permissible to hold liquid tokens for an extended period?
[/quote]

The bottom line here is that in many regions, 'members' need to be active in some way. The authors of the white paper likely had this in mind as a warning. "do you foresee" this is subject to a proposal. This is not an economics issue.

[quote="bjoernek, post:77, topic:19553"]
Your whitepaper states that "The Kinic DAO also earns ICP if the DAO stakes its ICP into a neuron on the Network Nervous System (NNS) and earns voting rewards.” I think this is not possible on the NNS. In particular, a canister is not allowed to be the controller of an NNS neuron.
*Question 5:* Could you clarify your plans regarding this?
[/quote]

Thank you for highlighting this. This may be deleted from the FE. From the authors:

"We went by what OC had. And I think any owner of ICP and stake and earn rewards, including a DAO
But if a  a canister is not allowed to be the controller of an NNS neuron then maybe that line should be deleted"

I suspect that the authors assumed that the DAO could own ICP in the future in some capacity and this line covers that.


**SNS CONFIG**
This is now open for public review. A readme is being added. 
I ask the community and NFT holders to review, to see that it matches the white paper and IDs previously provided.

Hi @apotheosis please do read this [latest post]( https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-thoughts-on-sns-decentralization-swap-proposals/20380) which highlights DFINITY's thoughts on decentralization swap proposals. 

We would encourage every team to thoughtfully consider the allocation being requested from the "Community Fund" prior to submitting their proposal.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-06-01 17:58:16 UTC | #80

Thank you.

Kinic hits all of the marks as an epic potential community driven DAO. In the white paper there has been a publicly visible [16%](https://74iy7-xqaaa-aaaaf-qagra-cai.icp0.io/whitepaper) CF request; which is much less than OpenChats's [30%~](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/109811) for example. I also think changing the process to have the CF finish SNS rounds is a great idea! Maybe there should also be some objective standards to what % is considered appropriate, in the future.

Kinic has had a 3~ month due diligence and planning process with Dfinity team members and in public forums. With such a long and detailed process I think the main thing left is to initiate a vote.

-------------------------

Pomey | 2023-06-04 14:59:44 UTC | #81

Spnr mentioned on their twitter that your valuation is USD 28.5 Milllion, which seems wrong. 

It should be 12.5 Million post money, which is 10 Million base (500K ICP * 4 = 2 Million ICP)  + 2.5 Million of 500K ICP gets raised in the SNS. That is 12.5 Million USD if SNS sale gets subscribed, and the best case can be dependent on the subscription by the community.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2023-06-04 15:23:19 UTC | #82

Yes. Not only is it not mathematically correct, it is also kind-of rude to do a review only after the proposal. They could have stated it any time during the public scrutiny in this thread; one month of time 🤷‍♀️ .

The GEO blocking feature came out last week and Kinic will be the first SNS to use it. We are not experts in this area but expect the process to be streamlined with time and the efforts of Dfinity with relevant teams and experts.

-------------------------

How you get into this Math?

Considering Hard cap, They are raising 1.5 Million ICP for 25%, pre money will be 6 Million ICP +1.5 Million ICP raised in SNS so  post money valuation  will be 7.5 million ICP = 37.5 Million USD (ICP=5USD)

Open-sourced and transparent SEO, machine learning (ZKML) and search algorithms, power a new paradigm in freedom to information-access.

This is the best one.

402,644.25 ICP with 522 participants. 1 of which did 100,000ICP.

What is the best way to get in touch with some ICP whales? 😂 

I would like to tell them: traditional 'search' models are quickly becoming obsolete.
Kinic DAO's roadmap is made to build the future of 'search'. 

On-chain zero-knowledge machine learning modules allow for amazing results.

1. Private inputs. You can have ML with health data and keep the privacy of the patients for example (KINIC API). Or allow for people to search and ask prompt questions while preserving their privacy.

2. Verifiable SEO. No deviation from the model to suit specific bias or groups.

3. Private models. A user could define their very own ML model based on open source work. They can then keep the model private while allowing access to it (KINIC API). One could imagine on-chain AI backed crypto trading bots, with verifiable computation. Or ML models suited for searching the internals of specific apps (DSCVR, Nuance, etc).

Tech VC are very active in this space because of the potential. An ICP based DAO focused on 'search' and ZKML has the promise to transform how we all interact and transact on-chain.

OC had 2375 participants. Kinic has 522 with an average of 100ICP per participant (51,000 / 521). 💪 
Kinic DAO is the first SNS (non-Dfinity). It is also the first that used the GEO-blocking feature.🤕

Let's push it over the minimum threshold.

Getting close to the deadline for end of Kinic SNS :slight_smile: 
I wanted to share some learnings from the SNS launch to help future SNS projects. 

After the voting was successfully completed there was a lot of congratulations and even a PR paper from Dfinity Marketing "Kinic hits xyz evaluation in SNS launch". There was an assumption that most projects that made it to SNS would easily be able to sell out within hours. Now we know this is not the case! 

Add in some geo-blocking, securities allegations, with bad macro and things will work against you.

1. Make a way for your users to directly contribute or at least show them how. Day one we spent a lot of time explaining how SNS works and how people could contribute. You can have 80,000 users in India.. but that traction will not help you with SNS if they have no way to contribute in the swap.

2. There was a lot of chatter 'we can just buy it after SNS when token unlocks. OC token fell in value.. '.  In the case of Kinic geo-blocked people need to buy at market after the sale.. so there is that. Something to keep in mind and plan for in your SNS.

3. It takes a lot of people contributing 10ICP to hit milestones. Kinic was focused on white paper, and tech, not marketing. Most SNS project will probably need to focus equally as hard on pure marketing. Kinic has had a lot of help from various projects and leaders in the IC space this past week 🙏 It has been insane to see 100% full-steam ahead marketing. Dfinity cannot RT or promote like they did in the past, due to reasons.. so you will need to plan for your SNS!

4. Someone bought 100,000 ICP worth of Kinic within an hour of the SNS starting. For your SNS you should probably figure our how to get more of these individuals on your side. Currently, it is the only possible way an SNS could sell out within a few hours; a statement that is provable with simple maths.

5. I think that early SNS projects should be non-profit backed and community goods; no greed. They should also have strong roadmaps. Some people want finished projects... however ultimately SNS is for creating a DAO to help improve community goods and open-sourced technology more quickly. If the project is finished and has great traction, why would it SNS? OC was backed by Dfinity so they did as an example for the SNS. The team also has Dfinity email address, so no fear of limited runway.  We can see that all upcoming SNS have had some form of traction, and execution, but none will be complete and polished apps. The SNS should be a growth engine for promising IC projects and open sourced technology.
