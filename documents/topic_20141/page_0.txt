Suppose I check the permission through the inspect message in a function of my canister, such as requiring the caller to be a specific Principal. So calling my canister from any other canister will pass the check?

From the [interface spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#system-api-inspect-message):

> The `canister_inspect_message` is *not* invoked for query calls, inter-canister calls or calls to the management canister.

Yeah, I made a demo and confirmed that calling my canister from any other canister will pass the check.
