Hi all,

For all those who are interested, I have created a dfinity module in [BlueprintJS](https://github.com/onehilltech/blueprint) called [blueprint-dfinity](https://github.com/onehilltech/blueprint/tree/master/packages/blueprint-dfinity). The goal of this module is to make it easier to write NodeJS clients for the Internet Computer. Some of the key features of this BlueprintJS module are:

* Declarative approach for defining actors instead of writing low-level JavaScript code
* Ability to bind actors and their source canisters to properties
* Codifies bootstrapping code

The current version on trunk uses the original property definition approach to define actors, and bind them to object properties. The newest version of the blueprint-dfinity, which is to be released with BlueprintJS v5, uses decorators to define the actors and bindings to properties on ES6 classes.

Please have a look and provide feedback.
