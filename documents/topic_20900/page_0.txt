I’d like to preface this by stating that this is in no means financial advice, nor is it meant to criticize the decentralized application in discussion. 

The following article is a collection of subjective personal opinions & objective observations of public information (of which have been objectively verified by the EMC Foundation), in regards to the Accumulator Neurons SNS Voting Criteria, which can be found in the resources below.

**Protocol Abstract**

Edge Matrix Computing (EMC) is a Layer 2 blockchain that aims to provide a decentralized marketplace for computational power, specifically with a focus on the training & utilization of Language Learning Models & other AI applications. 


**Analysis**

**Main Net dApp**

*Is the dApp live and operational? Has the development team demonstrated technical competence specifically regarding the Internet Computer Protocol?*

The EMC Protocol can not be considered a traditional dApp, but instead a Layer 2 Blockchain built on-top of the Internet Computer Protocol.

With this being said, the EMC Protocol currently has a functioning testnet, with over 1300+ computing nodes, and a handful of applications running. It appears as though the main net is pending the generation of an SNS DAO, as it will be utilized as the governance tool for the protocol.

https://chatbox.fun

In regards to the teams technical capabilities revolving around the Internet Computer, the team has demonstrated a few conflicting misunderstandings in regards to knowledge of the protocol within public discussions. Most notably, it has been cited that the SNS is required now, “because the token is ICRC-1 protocol and can only be generated through SNS”.

With this being said, the white paper shows a different perspective of the EMC Foundations technical understanding - offering an in-depth view of how the Internet Computer is leveraged within the EMC Protocol.

With these facts laid out, miscommunications can be plausibly attributed to a language barrier between the EMC Foundation, and parties engaging in dialogue (this statement is not intended to carry negative weight, as some have perceived it in previous dialogues).

The EMC Foundation has pledged themselves to a thorough understanding of the Internet Computer, and have insisted that they’re actively learning about the Internet Computer, and in the process of on-boarding the developers of their team to its unique functionalities.


*Is the dApp fully on-chain, meaning both the front end and back end of the protocol are hosted in Canister smart contracts?*

The EMC Protocol is not a typical dApp, and therefor results in a unique architecture. Notably, EMC is a layer 2 blockchain that leverages the Internet Computers infrastructure.

As such the blockchain itself operates independently of the Internet Computer, while leveraging Canister Smart Contracts to manage the Nodes, Computing Power Marketplace, dApp Store, Agent Management, and to record transaction history.

With this being said, the components that do leverage the Internet Computer, are currently in Canisters being utilized within the testnet, with the exception of the dApp store & Computing Power Marketplace, as they’re not yet complete.


*Does the dApp rely on third-party dependencies, such as off-chain providers, fee-gated APIs, or other mechanisms that rely on intermediaries? If so, is there a plan to transfer these dependencies to Canisters and the SNS? Additionally, is there a plan to fund these mechanisms independently, without solely relying on the SNS Treasury?*

From my understanding of the protocol, the only external dependency faced, would be the Node Providers & Computing Power of the Network.

With this being said, this is a dependency that every blockchain faces, and is something that is inherently decentralized in nature - as anyone can become supply computing power, or operate a node for the network, as long as they fulfill the hardware and $EMC requirements.


*Can the dApp, in its current form, be considered a complete product that fulfills its intended purpose? If the development team were to suddenly stop building, would the dApp still be able to function and achieve its objectives?*

Presently, the EMC Protocol does not fulfill its intended use - being the provision of a decentralized computing power marketplace & dApp store.

However, this may be attributed to the fact that the Protocol is premature, and is still under active development, before being proposed to the SNS.

In accordance to the roadmap, governance occurs after the creation of a computational power marketplace. As such, by the time the SNS Sale occurs, I would have to assume the Computing Power Marketplace, and in turn the entirety of the Protocol, will be available.

This could result in one of the more complete Protocols we’ve seen brought to SNS to date. Upon launch of main net (assuming it aligns with governance), in accordance to the roadmap, it seems as though there will be very minimal team intervention - as the entirety of the product will be completed to their vision.

However, it should be noted this is rather subjective, depending on the timeframe to complete pending functionalities, in regards to the timeframe of the SNS Sales’ occurrence.

If the marketplace & dApp store do not come before the sale, I would have to say no, it could not fulfill its objective - however if it did, the inverse would apply.

*Editing Note: Upon review by the EMC Protocol, it has been stated that it is intended for the Computing Power Marketplace & dApp store to come post-SNS.*

**Protocol Overview**

*Is the protocol open source?*

While it is stated EMC is an open source protocol, currently, only the frontend of the protocol can be located within the Github, which can be found below;

https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev


*Has the team provided a clear white paper that details the protocol comprehensively? Additionally, is there technical documentation available that explains the underlying mechanisms, functionalities, and concepts of the protocol?*

In my opinion, the EMC Foundation has provided a transparent white paper for the most part, clearly depicting the void to be filled, and the necessity of the application - while simultaneously addressing the inner workings of the protocol.

The whitepaper offers an extensive understanding of the underlying components of the protocol, specifically; State Machines, Validator Nodes, Smart Router Nodes, Computing Nodes, and other functionalities.

https://whitepaper.edgematrix.pro/en

Additionally, the EMC Github offers extensive documentation regarding the technical side of the protocol - seemingly aiming to offer a convenient on-boarding experience for alternative independent contributors.

https://github.com/EMCProtocol-dev


*Is there an insightful overview of the tokenomics provided? Is token allocation responsible & proportionate?*

Yes, the EMC Foundation does provide extensive insight into the tokenomics of $EMC, utilizing charts, tables, and equations to depict token supplies, allocations and potential inflation & deflation.

With this being said, something left unclear is the allocation groupings. It is currently unclear as to whether the EMC Foundation has a controlling interest of the treasury, similar to scenarios we’ve seen with DFINITY.

Additionally, other allocation groupings lack definition - leaving many of them up for interpretation of the reader.

https://whitepaper.edgematrix.pro/en/tokenology-of-usdemc

Currently, the token allocation of $EMC is depicted as follows;

Node Rewards - 20%

Transaction Rewards - 18%

Treasury - 15%

Team - 15%

Developer Rewards - 12%

Strategic Offering - 10%

Seed / Public Sale - 5%

Advisors / Early Supporters - 5%

With the token allocation laid out, we can break these allocations down into three groups, being “Protocol”, “Insider” & “Community”.

However, it should be noted that these groupings may be inaccurate, as allocation groupings lack definition within the paper. Primarily, I suspect that the “community” allocation could be drastically lower than portrayed - as “Strategic Offering” can imply a number of different meanings.

“Protocol” = 65% of Token Allocation

Node Rewards - 20%

Transaction Rewards - 18%

Treasury - 15%

Developer Rewards - 12%

“Insider” = 20% of Token Allocation

Team - 15%

Advisors / Early Supporters - 5%

“Community” = 15% of Token Allocation

Seed & Public Sale - 5%

Strategic Offering - 10%

This depicts that the “Community Allocation” is 5% less than the “Insider Allocation”, while the Purchaseable Allocation (being the Seed & Public Sale Allocation) is 3x less than what is assigned to the Team (Team Allocation).

With this being said, I don’t believe the token allocation, if left as present, represents a fair & proportionate decentralization sale & token allocation.


*Can the team clearly articulate why the SNS is the ideal decentralization solution for their application at this time?*

There have been conflicting reports from the EMC Foundation, when it comes to articulating why an SNS is best fit for their protocol.

However, the most compelling reasoning, has been the fact that they’d like to use the SNS DAO as their governance platform, and therefor would need access to sit upon Genesis of EMC Main net.

While I don’t disagree with the sentiment to utilize SNS as the governance framework for the protocol, I would like to note that this is not the only way to create a DAO or black-holed canisters. If the community feels as though it is premature to launch an SNS, I would reccomend that the EMC Foundation explores alternative DAO solutions, to eventually migrate to the SNS DAO.


*Is the team publicly known within the ecosystem? Do they have a visible presence in the crypto community or relevant industry events?*

While EMC’s Twitter & Social Media channels have gained traction over the recent months, all are very new - with the majority of accounts & branding being created within the last three months.

Created Twitter account March 2023

Created Youtube account April 2023

Created Github April 2023

Created Discord April 2023

Created Forum Account April 2023

As such, prior to EMC’s initial debut & acknowledgement by members of the DFINITY Foundation, the EMC foundation & protocol has not visibly played an active role within the ICP ecosystem.

Furthermore, of the publicly available team (5) members, only two reference blockchain experience within their CVs, being Alexis Zed (NFT Market) & Ping (Cosmos Hub Contributor).


*Is the team’s dynamic transparent? Do team members openly communicate and collaborate with the community?*

It is stated that the EMC Foundation has 30 active contributors, however of these 30 contributors, only 5 are available to be found within their website, being; Alexis, Alex, Shawn, Ping, and Allen.

However, this has been attributed to what is seemingly a reasonably legitimate fear of state repercussions for engaging with blockchain technology, as many of the EMC Foundation allegedly operates from within China.

https://edgematrix.pro/team/

Furthermore, given the teams rather recent entrance to the ecosystem there is not a vast history of community collaboration or communication, however the team has notably been making an effort to engage through the Mora app actively.


*What is the team’s track record and experience in the relevant field?*

The team has proclaimed extensive backgrounds, with public facing information being found below;

Alexis Zed

With this being said, I have only been able to find accounts linked to 3 of the 5 public facing members of the EMC Foundation. Additionally, it can also be noted there is no reference to KSANA or EMC within these profiles, however, this may be attributed to regional laws & restrictions.


**Proof of Valuation**

*Has the team shown comparable raises within the industry sector?*

No, the EMC Foundation has not shown comparable raises, any other reference in regards to the EMC Protocols Valuation.


*Does the valuation accurately address the current and potential market shares?*

While the EMC Foundation does touch on the potential of the AI Industry within their whitepaper, the team has not provided any form of indication regarding the valuation, or the potential market share of the product.


*Has the team provided transparency regarding the valuation? Is the valuation method disclosed, and is the math behind it available for review?*

No, the EMC Foundation has not made any of the information regarding the valuation of the EMC Protocol public or transparent. There is currently no reference to the valuation of the protocol within any documentation.


**Security Audit**

*Is a security audit necessary for the application?*

I personally believe that a security audit would be beneficial and necessary to this protocol.

As it is a blockchain, managing computing power, it has the potential to open attack vectors on the participants on its network, or itself.

As such, I would recommend some degree of code review.


*Has the code received at least some degree of review? Are there feasible in-ecosystem alternatives for conducting a security audit? Is there transparency and disclosure regarding the security measures taken?*

With information currently publicly available, there are no indications that the EMC Protocol has received any degree of code review.

In accordance to the original SNS criteria, a few potential solutions to achieving some degree of code review, include exploring the utilization of @infu / Anvil’s Blast Services, or crowdfunding specifically for the purpose of a security audit.


**Neuron Fund Allocation**

*Is the Neuron Fund utilized? If so, what percentage of the sale is the Neuron Fund?*

The EMC Foundation proposes that the Neuron Fund contributes 660,000 ICP to the SNS Sale. This equates to ~66% of the sale, assuming it meets its minimum threshold, while representing 33% of the sale, assuming it meets its maximum threshold.


*What is the size of the contribution in respect to the size of the Neuron Fund?*

Given the Neuron Fund currently consist of 5M Maturity (assuming a 1:1 ICP-Maturity ratio for simplicity), the EMC Foundation has requested that the Neuron Fund contributes ~13% of its resources.


**Conclusion**

In conclusion, while I value the protocol that the EMC Foundation has laid out, and support their application, the Accumulator Neuron will be voting to “reject to postpone” for the following reasons, as detailed above;

- The protocol is not complete; many of the core components are yet to be built, and are reliant upon the EMC Foundation if they’re too be seen through

- While the frontend of the protocol is opensource, the backend can not be found within the repository provided

- The current distribution of token allocation is not fair or proportionate (in my opinion) to SNS contributors. The team sells ~5% of the protocol for 1-2M ICP, while personally retaining ~15%

- Information regarding the valuation has not been provided - 2M ICP for 5% puts the valuation of the protocol 40M ICP / ~170m USD

- Lack of security audit within a blockchain protocol leaves potential attack vectors & vulnerabilities unaddressed

- Neuron Fund contribution exceeds 60% of sale if minimum threshold is met, while exceeding 30% if the maximum threshold is met. Additionally, requested contributions exceed 10% of total Neuron Fund Maturity.

Additionally, given the lack of internal transparency within the EMC Foundation (I do understand that this is out of a genuine fear of state repercussions), it may help absolve public concerns revolving around the EMC Foundation, if DFINITY were to publish their own due diligence.

It has been stated DFINITY has done due diligence, as members of the foundation have been personally vouching for the EMC Protocol - therefor I don’t think it is unreasonable to ask for insight on how these conclusions were deduced.

I’d again like to reiterate that I see value in a protocol of this nature, and would like to see it flourish on the Internet Computer, however I feel as though it is currently premature to go to the SNS as-is.

Thankyou for this thorough, fair and balanced analysis of the EMC project and team @Accumulating.icp 
I agree there is still much to clarify and understand about the project implementation and code release milestones and how they mesh with the desire to be DAO-governed from an early stage for the EMC protocol.
I hope and encourage the @EMCprotocol team to read this post thoroughly and respond to the specific issues you raised here that leads you to your “reject to postpone” voting decision

Appreciate the DD @Accumulating.icp 

I think the idea of EMC is amazing but given that the team showed up out of nowhere, lack of open source and high valuation. This looks more like an early 2017 ICO cash grab than a legitimate project. 

I'm curious who at Dfinity is vouching for this team and why there is less scrutiny for this project to do an SNS launch rather than Sonic who's been around for awhile?

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-06-22 21:12:34 UTC | #6

Thanks for posting your DD. I am waiting on a few pending calls with other EMC senior members (their CTO, Shawn and Flash, PM for EMC Hub) before concluding on my DD.

I have long argued that it may not necessary for folks to reveal their identity if their work can vouch for their identities. In case of devs, this can be tracked through github commits and if appropriate,  their prior history. In case of otherwise team members,  it can be tracked through their presentations , their medium articles etc.

It has been represented that one of the EMC team member had been recently to Zurich to meet Dom and perhaps Jan and Lomesh. If this could be confirmed by Dfinity (the mere existence of a meeting), that would be great for the community wanting more clarification. @diegop : can you help? Dfinity may not be in a position to officially endorse ; but nevertheless the existence of outreach would help.

cyberowl | 2023-06-22 22:25:19 UTC | #7

That is a really high valuation.

-------------------------

EMCprotocol | 2023-06-23 09:20:23 UTC | #8

First, we want to thank @Accumulating for the thorough and professional due diligence report. It shows a strong sense of responsibility towards the ICP community and the EMC project.

Secondly, we appreciate the efforts and ongoing communication from @Accumulating.icp , @Icdev2dev and @icarus . EMC team is eager and open to share EMC’s technology, business model, tokenology, and global market expansion with ICP community. We have also received valuable feedback and suggestions.

Lastly, EMC will continuously improve the GPU computing power network and develop EMC Hub (a marketplace for computing power and AI models). Base on EMC Hub, we will organize AI+Web3 hackathons to bring massive users into the IC community and Web3 through AI applications.

The EMC team has updated the tokenology based on the mechanism of SNS and the feedback collected from the community. Please refer to [Distrubution and Voting of Tokens - WhitePaper of EMC ](https://whitepaper.edgematrix.pro/en/tokenology-of-usdemc/distrubution-and-voting-of-tokens) for more information.

[/quote]

I’m going to assume this is directed at me, regardless of the incorrect @.

It’s been repeatedly stated that the $ICP ecosystem should just “trust EMC Foundation, because DFINITY did their due diligence”. This was then reinforced when you made multiple public statements endorsing & defending the EMC Foundation. 

With this being said, will DFINITY be sharing the due diligence that has been proclaimed, offering the ecosystem the same level of insight & conviction select DFINITY Foundation Members seem to hold?

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-08-10 00:06:13 UTC | #12

Did you see this post from DFINITY?  I think it qualifies as sharing their due diligence.

[quote="zire, post:53, topic:20194"]
@EMCprotocol is not a scam. It’s a legit startup founded by a group of very experienced tech entrepreneurs from China. Members of the current IC community may or may not understand or agree with the way EMC team articulates their vision. That’s all fine and I think the EMC team is open for suggestions and discussions. As @MillionMiles of 8yeargangDAO said, we in the IC community should extend open arms to welcome new players to embrace IC, not to trash them.

While it’s reasonable to perform your own due diligence on an IC project, let me share a few notes about the particular situation in China:

* China has about 7 million developers vs 24 million in the rest of the world. China has the second most number of unicorns in the world after US and is quickly catching up (say, ByteDance). Most of those developers or tech entrepreneurs are NOT on Twitter. Though Twitter seems like the way of life for crypto folks and the only place that matters to prove someone’s presence in crypto, it is not for Chinese. Every popular social media platform, from Facebook, Youtube, Google, Instagram, Reddit, Medium, Discord and Twitter is banned in China. It’s entirely possible that a famous KOL of millions of fans in China only has a puny presence on Twitter. According to [Statista, WeChat is now a top 5 social media global platform with 1.3 billion MAU and Twitter is No. 14 with 556 million MAU](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). I’m not trying to back up any specific number from EMC for them but merely saying that there is a much bigger parallel universe out there beyond the usual Twitter/DFINITY Dev Forum/Discord etc. ICP is uniquely positioned to attract developers from that parallel universe (which has been dominated by Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and ByteDance) and EMC is now trying to bridge to that crowd with its integration to ICP.
* The entire crypto industry is pretty tiny compared to the traditional Web2 space. ICP, if viewed as a decentralized AWS, is the only blockchain that can speak to literally millions of developers who are used to building on AWS/Azure/GCP in kubernetes (and every self-respectable developer is now toying with chatGPT/AIGC). Right now, there is no elegant solution for the crypto industry to reach out to this much bigger cohort, for a variety of reasons that [Signal’s founder Moxie laid out in his famous “My First Impression of Web3” article in Jan 2022 ](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html). I’d encourage members of the IC community to be more open-minded and try to help the new kid on the block. Yes, they’re new, but isn’t that what we’re trying to do here, to bring in new blood who shares our vision and audacity? We should cheer for someone who just created an account on this forum recently, not to make that a liability for them.

With this out of way, please go back to your suggestions and feedback to the EMC team on how they can present themselves better in the IC community, engage the community, and earn that trust
[/quote]

I’m asking if they’d share the due diligence that verifies the claims made within this statement. 

I’d agree they shared their final voting due diligence which is beneficial & what we’re looking for - but that doesn’t pertain to this exact scenario.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-08-10 01:44:14 UTC | #14

Do you mind pointing to some specific claims that you think need to be clarified?  It's not clear to me what due diligence is needed.  @zire is Chinese American and lives in China, so he seems like a credible contributor to the conversation who can describe the particular situation in China.  What I read to be his main point is that the IC community should be more diplomatic and welcoming to new players such as EMC Protocol.  There is nothing wrong with asking tough questions, but we can all be civilized in our conversation.  That seems like a reasonable ask to me.  Perhaps I'm not understanding the need for due diligence of the claims in this quote.

This is a bold claim to make (with a lot of weight behind it as a DFINITY employee).

Furthermore, it’s been stated by the EMC Foundation on multiple accounts that they have received DFINITYs due diligence - therefor the community should simply just trust them. 

I’m not sure why you’re trying to walk them out of explaining how this conclusion was achieved.
