A while ago @crusso suggested I write up how Motoko’s runtime value representation allows us avoiding  allocating memory when wrapping values in `?`, which is kinda important given that the iterator interface does that a lot. Enjoy:

If you like that kind of stuff: Motoko is Open Source and it is possible to contribute without being on DFINITY’s payroll!
