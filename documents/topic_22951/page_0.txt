What if neurons could choose to forgo maturity and receive limited free transactions and cycles?

What if a user could lock ICP into a neuron and instead of getting maturity, they could for example be able to run limited cycles for an AI they use (or some other app hosted on the IC) which the host/dev doesn't want to pay for
