Hi folks! New comer here, just start learning to build dfinity app! I need some help regarding user identity.

For the record, I'm using the dfx (v0.7.0-beta4) cli tool. And I've read the [access control tutorial](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/access-control.html). 

So, I know I can create identity with `dfx identity new bob`. This will generate a .pem file in `~/.config/dfx/identity/bob/identity.pem`. And I have no problem calling canister with specific identity from command line, it's in the tutorial. 

My question is, how do I do the same from a **web frontend** interface? I had a hard time finding useful info on this topic.

After some digging I learn that the frontend served from an asset canister, built with default setup, include the `@dfinity/agent` lib, and it will generate an `Anonymous` identity (using ED25519 I guess)? 

How does the .pem file relate to the ED25519 key pair generated in browser? Can I import this .pem secretKey to be used in browser (convert it into a `Ed25519KeyIdentity`) , or vice versa?

Somebody unstuck me please! Thanks in advance.

I think the correct answer is: Not at all.

The identity management in the browser is undergoing some important and presumably innovative changes, but I am not sure how much I should spoil. Expect some interesting demos at next weekâ€™s event!

Hi, where can I find info about setting up a ED25519 key pair in my browser? thank u

I have an example of generating new identity and cache it in the browser: https://github.com/ninegua/reversi/blob/master/src/reversi_assets/public/index.js#L12-L30

Note that this has nothing to do with the Internet Identity service on IC.

It is frontend javascript

If you have followed the hello world tutorial, you have created a `hello` repository, and there is javascript file in `src/hello_assets/src/index.js`. You can modify it to use your own frontend code.

I was trying to check in the code, is this still viable?
