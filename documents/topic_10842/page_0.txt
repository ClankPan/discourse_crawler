When opening the proposal 43740 and clicking ADOPT and confirming the selection I get a loading icon and in couple of seconds I get back to the proposal page where I can vote again.

If I select "Hide Open proposals where all your neurons have voted or are ineligible to vote", the proposal gets hidden, so I guess the vote got accepted but it's not showing as such. 

Thank you.
