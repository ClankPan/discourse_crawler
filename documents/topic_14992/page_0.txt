**Named Neuron Proposal - Always Votes**

Introducing the first neuron that will vote independently on all proposal types except exchange rate proposals. 

**Twitter Account:** https://twitter.com/alwaysvotes_xyz

**Website:** http://alwaysvotes.xyz/ (tip: On mobile hold you phone sideways) 

**Edit: this FAQ is not accurate anymore I will change the neuron name and voting policy to Always Reject for it's lifetime**

**Neuron Id**: 12890113924500239096

**Long term voting promise**

Will vote on every proposal so you get the maximum staking rewards.

**Current voting policy**

- Reject every proposal besides exchange rate proposals
- Announce any change in voting policy at least a month in advance
- Publish a post mortem in case “always votes” fails to vote on a proposal

**Purpose**

- Make the signal that the NNS provides less noisy by filtering out people with voter apathy. With a neuron that always rejects a bigger percentage who voted **accept** truly meant it or trusted their named neuron.
- A [protest vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_vote) for people who don’t feel properly represented by the current governance system.
- Offer a way in the future to default reject proposals except for the proposals that you care about

This is the short summary. If you would like a more extensive FAQ please go to http://alwaysvotes.xyz/. 

I will create a named neuron proposal in the coming week, but if you would already like to follow me this neuron is already working and you can follow 12890113924500239096 manually. Happy to take any questions.

**EDIT**

Based on feedback I will change the name to "Always Reject" and make that the long term voting promise. I'll update the FAQ to reflect this at a later time and leave the original one up for now.

Have a way to reject if two neurons you want to agree vote differently
[/quote]

If your neuron is following two neurons and they vote differently, then your neuron will vote to reject.  That's how the NNS following works today.  

In order to vote to Approve, greater than 50% of your Followees must vote to Approve
In order to vote to Reject, 50% or more of your Followees must vote to Reject

This plan does not work if a Followee neuron decides to abstain.  When your neuron has 3 followees, if 1 votes yes, 1 votes no, and 1 abstains, then your neuron will abstain.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-08-20 14:51:40 UTC | #3

I thought you needed more than 50% happy to update the post if I'm wrong!

Edit:

Looks like you are right:


```
if 2 * no >= followees.len() {
                return Vote::No;
}
```

Will remove that usecase from the FAQ and forum post

« Always vote “reject” » would be an accurate name for your neuron. In the case you keep « always vote », people are misled. So if you really want to genuinely offer to people the possibility of choosing such a protest vote, you have to announce it clearly : « always vote “reject” ». 

« Alway vote » is not necessarily a protest vote, it just sounds like « don’t miss a reward ». However, people have to know they will not always only vote, but vote « reject ». Otherwise, you will carry people who don’t want to alway protest, but only always vote. This is why it is misleading : people have to be warned about what they are really choosing. 

So if you want to be consistent with your purpose, describe the whole thing in the name of the neuron.

The question is : do you really want to offer the possibility of a protest vote to people (which can be respectable), or do you just want to be followed by them ? In the case where your purpose is pure of self interest, I don’t have any doubt about the fact that you will choose to rebrand it with the accurate name.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-20 19:07:12 UTC | #6

I will vote no to the this proposal for the following reasons:

1) the neuron name is designed to attract passive voters who do no research, yet the neuron intent is not aligned with the long term best interest of the IC.  I find the name to be misleading.
2) a strategic intent of this neuron is to attract disgruntled seed investors.  There could be a lot of voting power associated with these neurons if this strategy is successful.
3) it will be easy for people to think they are making a smart decision by following two neurons…a public neuron they trust AND the Always Votes neuron. A neuron configured this way will indeed always vote NO regardless of how their other trusted neuron votes.
4)  there is nothing preventing the owner of Always Votes from voting NO immediately after a proposal is submitted to the NNS (within minutes or seconds) due to the programmatic intent of how this neuron voting will work.  Once the Always Votes neuron vote is cast it will be impossible for followers to vote manually because their neuron will have already voted.
5) In the future, it will be necessary for individual proposal topics to be separated from the All Topics category in order to achieve decentralization.  I think disgruntled seed investors and new people who have no interest in anything except following a neuron that will “Always Vote” are the most likely people to configure every single proposal topic to follow Always Votes.  If this happens, then the Always Votes neuron will have pre-populated large voting power (relative to others) on proposal topics that change the protocol as we move toward decentralization.  I see this as a potentially major security risk to the IC.

While I would very much like there to be a lot of choices in the NNS dApp, this Always Votes proposal seems like too much risk.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-08-20 19:39:56 UTC | #7

@Always_Votes i am still torn on your proposal. I respect and approve of your attempt to provide a “protest vote” for individuals who want to express that they are unhappy with the state of the network. If you were to dedicate your neuron to serving only that purpose, and made that clear in the name, then I would adopt.

However, I have to agree with @Roman and @wpb that too many followers could be misled given your current choice of name. I would prefer something like “Protest Vote - Always Reject”.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-20 20:12:35 UTC | #8

It’s not straight forward. Should just be “always reject”

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-20 20:28:33 UTC | #9

Is Always Reject good enough?  The intent of this neuron is to Always Reject All Proposals Including Protocol Updates…

The person behind this proposal could easily start over with a new name and a new statement of policy and get a named neuron passed.  Nobody has any knowledge or control of how the neuron is configured except the owner.  So they could call themselves Always Votes Yes and then configure to automatically vote No on all protocol proposals.

The only concrete data that the governing body can use to approve or reject a named neuron proposal is the name of the neuron and the social media credibility of whoever claims to be behind the proposal.   It’s even possible to use someone else’s name who has social credit as a cover for someone nefarious who controls the named neuron.  That’s why it is important for the neuron ID to be posted in the forum deliberation before the NNS proposal is submitted.  When they do, it enables a few of us to validate social media identity and call attention to any discrepancies.

At least so far the named neurons that have submitted proposals are known personalities in the community.  This Always Votes neuron has a completely new and completely anonymous person behind it.  Perhaps that should be a good reason to reject no matter what the name.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-20 20:59:01 UTC | #10

I will vote against this named neuron. I don't see how this benefit the IC and act in a way to increase the value of ICP.  

In the same manner I would vote against admitting a named neuron that proposed to always vote yes.

Why are we turning the NNS into a circus?

## Response to Roman

I’m happy to make changes based on feedback but don’t try to make it seem like I’m trying to trick people with the current name and approach. I was very explicit on these points in my FAQ on [https://alwaysvotes.xyz/](https://alwaysvotes.xyz/) but I can repeat them again here:

There is a difference between the stated **long term voting promise** and the **current voting policy**. 

I only want to put things in the long term voting promise that will stay true for the entire lifetime of the neuron. 

The current voting policy only indicates how the neuron is voting **right now**. I wrote stated that it might change in the future based on community feedback. 

I also clearly stated that the neuron had multiple goals. The protest function was one which people could express through voting on non motion proposals. The other was getting noise out of the signal on motion proposals.

*”In the case where your purpose is pure of self interest”* 

Which self interest is this serving exactly? I don’t gain anything out of this. It simply rejects every vote. I’m not going to vote yes on anything even when it is in my self interest. If I did that the vote could be socially nullified as it was against the voting policy. 

I only lost money and time on this so far setting up the neurons, cron job, and trying to do a proper write up of my voting policy. 

Handing over voting power to a proper DAO is even more work for me. Changing it to simply **always reject** makes life far easier for me so consider it done. 

I also did a quick scan through your comment history to see if you have build any cool things on the IC. Instead I saw you are a member of ICPCM! It would have been nice for you to mention that bias.

## Response to wpb

Wow I’m absolutely flabbergasted. @wpb the champion of governance and important member of ICPMN immediately says he would vote no after I put in all this effort instead of having a conversation.

You gladly welcomed “Crypto Is Good” whose voting policy was to *“follow ICDevs except on proposals that I care about”* because he had the philosophy that everybody should be able to create a neuron. You welcomed every new proposal since then. 

His policy seems way more passive then setting up two neurons, writing up some code, and writing up a clear FAQ of **exactly** how I will vote. He even indicated that he is a champion for [the passive staker](https://twitter.com/crypto_is_good/status/1560815360991010817?s=21&t=-KKiACHswvCf6nJ5ZgtAow).

“*The neuron name is designed to attract passive voters who do no research, yet the neuron intent is not aligned with the long term best interest of the IC. I find the name to be misleading.”*

Please don’t try to paint me as misleading. The name “Always Votes” does exactly what it says, It always votes. If somebody truly signs up for the NNS sees “Always Votes” and only needs that to make a decision then yes I want to filter those people out. 

That is one of the main points of this neuron. To to get the noise of passive followers out of the system. You just don’t want that because the noise is currently pointed at **ICPMN**! If you truly cared about governance you would want as many *thoughtful* followers as possible.

*”A strategic intent of this neuron is to attract disgruntled seed investors. There could be a lot of voting power associated with these neurons if this strategy is successful.”*

I’m not targeting seed investors at all! I just mentioned Arthur’s article as an example of huge amounts of voting power not caring about the current form of governance. I’m there for anybody who doesn’t care. Seed investors are already getting maximum voting rewards by following ICPMN. If they were to switch over to me it would be an **active** governance decision to not follow ICPMN anymore not passive. 

For non motion proposals they are following the foundation so again that would be an **active** decision. If you are against them following me you are against active participation, the passive thing to do would be to keep following ICPMN and just collect those rewards. 

*”there is nothing preventing the owner of Always Votes from voting NO immediately after a proposal is submitted to the NNS (within minutes or seconds) due to the programmatic intent of how this neuron voting will work. Once the Always Votes neuron vote is cast it will be impossible for followers to vote manually because their neuron will have already voted”*

I stated that initially I won’t give people a promise to be able to vote themselves. And that it could become a set time of the day later. People are free to choose themselves if they are fine with that or can choose somebody else otherwise. 

You can see a timestamp of the vote in the dashboard

”*In the future, it will be necessary for individual proposal topics to be separated from the All Topics category in order to achieve decentralization. I think disgruntled seed investors and new people who have no interest in anything except following a neuron that will “Always Vote” are the most likely people to configure every single proposal topic to follow Always Votes. If this happens, then the Always Votes neuron will have pre-populated large voting power (relative to others) on proposal topics that change the protocol as we move toward decentralization. I see this as a potentially major security risk to the IC.”*

Now you are just completely speculating on how future upgrades to the NNS will look like you don’t decide that. As if seed investors who are disgruntled suddenly don’t have a long term interest in the value of their ICP anymore. If we throw that assumption out of the window we should do away with the whole NNS as it currently works. 

*”Nobody has any knowledge or control of how the neuron is configured except the owner. So they could call themselves Always Votes Yes and then configure to automatically vote No on all protocol proposals.”*
 

What? This makes absolutely no sense. If I create a named neuron called “Always Votes Yes” and and then always vote No you could easily see that in your votes and the dashboard. The whole premise is that the voting policy is so simple that it can be verified by just the votes. Something easily seen in the NNS dapp or dashboard.

*”The only concrete data that the governing body can use to approve or reject a named neuron proposal is the name of the neuron and the social media credibility of whoever claims to be behind the proposal. It’s even possible to use someone else’s name who has social credit as a cover for someone nefarious who controls the named neuron. That’s why it is important for the neuron ID to be posted in the forum deliberation before the NNS proposal is submitted.”*

Again this makes absolutely no sense. I’m not using anybody’s name here I created a brand new one. I now **have** two clear social outlets in the forum and twitter as well as a website. I **did** post my neuron ID here and on the website. On that website I explicitly state to not vote on a proposal until for “Always Votes” until I tweet about it. 

”*This Always Votes neuron has a completely new and completely anonymous person behind it. Perhaps that should be a good reason to reject no matter what the name.”*

Anonymity is one of the core values of crypto. Spinner cash won the hackathon. ICP Maximalist is anonymous! This guy could be easily lying about who he is, [you didn’t raise any issues there](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/named-neuron-proposal-the-accumulators-neuron/14980). 

---


Motion proposals are meaningless to the protocol! It only serves as an indicator for the foundation to implement the actual code changes. Having careless voting power follow ICPMN is far more dangerous than having it follow “always reject”. 

If I tried to sneakily vote yes on a motion proposal that says “query calls should always return poop emojis” everybody would just ignore it, unfollow me and nothing would happen. 

This is in stark contrast to how ICPMN works where members could be bought by some hedgefund to sway a vote and then the foundation could consider it as a mandate by the community. 

I’m really not going to get any meaningful following on non motion proposals if you have any believe at all in the long term incentives in play. These proposals are currently accepted with about 99% yes votes and basically only my neuron voting against. 

It is ridiculous that currently named neurons with a vested interest to maintain their voting power get to decide over adding new named neurons. It was all well and good until somebody shows up with actual political differences over the role passive stakers should play.

I consider this deliberation to be the conversation.  Your proposal as you have presented it will cause me to vote no.  I don’t think you gave a sufficient rebuttal to most of my points.  Being anonymous and having social credibility are different.  Many people in the IC ecosystem are anonymous while still being known to the community.  Your neuron name is misleading even if it is accurate and your intended policy strikes me as one that could be a security risk, especially in the long term.

I recognize that you clearly know the ecosystem and the participants in the ecosystem.  You seem very familiar with ICP governance and current events.  It seems probable that you are known in the community by whatever identity you normally use.  I don’t understand why you chose a new anonymous identity to pursue this proposal, but you are certainly free to make that choice.  It doesn’t help persuade me to vote for your proposal.

Which self interest is this serving exactly?
[/quote]

Simply gain more voting power and having more influence thanks to the liquid democracy, which can be a purpose per se, but also a purpose to have a direct impact on governance : ICP allows a 51% attack for very few boxes, as you don't have to stake a lot of ICP to have a lot of power, thanks to the liquid democracy. But having influence because people chose to follow you knowing explicitly what they are following, and having influence because people were misled (also* by themselves if they decide to follow without looking more detailed informations) by is different.

[quote="Always_Votes, post:11, topic:14992"]

This information is crystal clear for anyone having been in the ecosystem for a while or for anyone interested in following ICPMN, so your discover is a discover for you ; and I don't really get which bias are you talking about, but among these bias, let me give one to you : 

[quote="Always_Votes, post:11, topic:14992"]
I was very explicit on these points in my FAQ on [https://alwaysvotes.xyz/ ](https://alwaysvotes.xyz/) but I can repeat them again here:
[/quote]

As a member of the ICPMN Neuron and as someone being here since may 2021 and interested in the governance of IC since the same date, I can say you that very few people will read this, as very few people will read your message or even this forum, so "repeat them again here" will still be not enough. As you are obviously wanting to become an actor of governance (I don't have any problem with this of course, on the contrary), let me warn you that the main part of followers just want to follow – to not miss a reward, as you understood it – and won't look for detailed informations. So, a lot of people won't go beyond the name of your neuron and this name is not specific enough if you choose to take a verb as part of the name of your neuron, specifically when it is a verb linked to economic incentives. This is why I was talking about a name modification. But, obviously, you are free to choose this name.

*Still, on an ethical level, in my humble opinion : Every followees have to act knowing that very few people will read the "terms and conditions", and not take advantage of this economy of thought. This is why @wpb repeat a lot the informations about ICPMN in a maximum of channels : twitter, telegram, forum, etc. to not mislead people, even when the intention of mislead them is not among our intentions. And any followee which would say : "they were able to find the informations, they just did not look for it" would be dishonest or not skilled enough, because it is clear that the main part of the people don't read the terms and conditions. Being a followee means : go beyond the lack of will or the lack of time of the followers, so, again, repeat the conditions here is not enough.

Anyway, again, thank you for your answer.

Maybe you don't consider it like building or even valuable (as you oppose "build any cool things" and "be a member of ICPMN"), but to me, participate to the IC governance shaping, even if it was just by talking on this forum with one of the brightest spirits of our generation, is invaluable.

EDIT : @ysyms, by his question, is proving my point : 

[quote="ysyms, post:18, topic:14992"]
Can you guarantee a down vote on every proposal??
[/quote]

He is an intensive reader of the forum, a very active member of the IC, and even a reader of this topic. In one word : he is not a regular staker ; he is a staker particularly interested in IC ; still he did not see your link toward your policy document, then you understand that attach your policy document is not enough for regular stakers' awareness.

PS : to be clear, I don't suspect you of being a nefarious actor. One of the persons I respect the more in the ecosystem : @LightningLad91, told you that your initiative could have an utility, but my point is only about semantics aspects : your neuron's name is not enough accurate. **If "always reject" is not accurate either in your opinion, because you want to be able to change your vote's orientation, maybe "always protests", "always protest votes" or "always votes protesting" is a solution.**

**Repsonse to** @wpb 

”*I don’t understand why you chose a new anonymous identity to pursue this proposal, but you are certainly free to make that choice. It doesn’t help persuade me to vote for your proposal.”*

Anonimity is key to preventing a 5 dollar wrench attack. If I had created a neuron where the policy was to trust me based on my personality and involvement so far I would have to reveal it. But the policy is so simple (conceptually not the time and effort I put in it) that that isn’t necessary. You know exactly what you are getting with this neuron even if you don’t know or like me. 

The key issue here is that current named neurons get to decide over new ones. We can keep repeating that people can still choose to vote themselves, but we know that that just isn’t the reality. Especially if we are actually going to get hundreds of named neurons proposals. 

Thank you for reconsidering with fresh eyes when I update the FAQ

**Response to** @cryptoisgood 

“*I don’t think going after me strengthens your case brother. I’m pretty active in the community, governance and fully doxed. Everyone knows what I’m about”*

I really don’t mean to go after you on a personal level. You spreading the word about the IC is highly appreciated. I just meant to highlight that the effort put into the neuron wasn’t that high and that was actually one of the key points of your neuron. That everybody should be able to make one! I don’t know if I agreed with that at the time, but the NNS did and the bar has been set.

**Response to** @Roman 

“because it is clear that the main part of the people don’t read the terms and conditions.”

I actually fully agree with this point which is why I already decided to take your feedback and turn it into a simple **Always Reject** which will stay true for it’s lifetime. There really couldn’t be a more clear promise in the title of the neuron. If anybody chooses to follow it they know exactly what they are getting and we shouldn’t try to make peoples decisions for them by rejecting form the named neuron list.

But this is exactly the point of this neuron! There is a lot of uninformed voting power which needs to go somewhere. If you buy some stock simply because you like it you are not forced to vote on every minutia of running the company to get your dividend. 

On the IC we force this uninformed voting power to participate and take it as gospel when making decisions. We should just talk to key builders and ask them what they want offline before making proposals.

I don't want to get any influence with this neuron I want to give people who don't understand the IC at all to still have an outlet to participate.

The theoretical design of being long term incentivised in the protocol clearly still doesn’t work. There is tragedy of the commons at play where your personal stake is not just not a big enough motivation to put in any effort. 

**Response to** @ysyms 

In it’s current form I can’t, I could get hacked. But I think this should maybe be should possible by removing all the keys from my Internet Identity and having a voting blackholed canister as the hotkey. This seems like far too much effort at this point though when I’m not even sure I will get a meaningful following. 

But motion proposals are meaningless for the protocol. If I were to every vote yes people could just ignore it. Surely you are not including a yes vote from **Always Reject** in the results. These motion proposals are very much a social agreement. And yes definitely remove me from the list if I break that promise.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-08-21 10:33:38 UTC | #20

Btw I also don't think we should set a precedent of rejecting programmatic neurons because they encourage passive staking. 

There could be other interesting programatic neurons in the future. E.g a policy of "I will reject when 10% of the NNS rejects" because you already consider that a too large minority opposition for a proposal to go through.

I hope your vote will pass.  I will follow you for the governance voting.  If you say you will vote on all governance, I will change my setting to follow your neuron right away.
I do not agree with @wpb that a protest vote does not bring anything to IC.  Critics are important (crucial) to make the system better.  I know by experience.
Also, seems that some people will reject your neuron name because you don't think like them.  In some other thread, I have seen questions on about the person have voted before.  This is totally irrelevant.

You should not have to beg to have your named neuron as there would always have some people that may think like you.

If @cryptoisgood has been voted positive while saying he was going to vote like always... in a sluggish way, I would not understand that your would get voted out because of your conviction.

I was also very surprised that some people have already disclosed that they would vote No right here.  is this to influence the vote?

Sad to see this.  TMO it is not how the NNS will evolve the right way.

I used to vote manually on all governance proposal.  I was spending lots of time reading and trying to understand all impacts of all governance proposals.  After having seen the proposal to evade the TAX, wich have no benefit to IC and is against the Dfinity own guide, and after have seen the proposal (forgot the number) about resetting all following every 6 months to clean up the NNS (get the dead people out of voting) that was massively passed and Dfinity don't implement with some very weak excuses, I now follow to get paid and do passive staking as I find it does not worth my time.

So at least, my following to your neuron would have some sort of meaning now.

How can you help decentralization if you accept only named neuron that think like you and vote like you?  Just not making any sense to me.

Thank you for submitting this request and hope you will pass.

If @cryptoisgood has been voted positive while saying he was going to vote like always… in a sluggish way, I would not understand that your would get voted out because of your conviction.

Their main issue is that OP is anonymous. I’m a very active member of the community and everyone knows who I am. Maybe a lot of people looked past my proposal and into the person who is submitting it. That said I got plenty of rejections.

I low key have issue with protest voting. It could bring dfinity to a halt if it has more power than dfinity neuron. What if they can’t run their operations?

coteclaude | 2022-08-21 12:27:30 UTC | #27

I didn't know that being known and active on social media was a rule to be named neuron?  Where does that new thing comes from?
Is there a new named neuron guide that I am not aware of?
Does privacy only apply to transactions now?

This is exactly what I am saying.  Impossible to follow the logic.

@levi is active on this forum.  He was voted out couple of months ago for a named neuron while being very serious and knowledgable in the programming.  People were asking him how he voted in the past and, although I can be very wrong,  looks like he was rejected for his conviction. If this was the case, it is very bad.

Is it better to have 20 named neurons that think the same way and follow each other or have 5 that have different views and convictions?

Where is the logic?  I just don't get it and this is why I am all in for the protest neuron to help the NNS governance to grow in a better way.

Personally, I am against sluggish voting but I am happy that @cryptoisgood a named neuron so people who like this way to vote can follow him.

EasySteve | 2022-08-21 15:08:24 UTC | #28

While I see the value in this I do have a few thoughts as this would be the first named neuron that is set to vote programmatically using an external code base. 

1. I don't understand why voting every two hours is feasible but 24, 48, or even 70 hours is not. Technically speaking this should not be an issue. I'd like to see this ironed out.

2. Naturally the reliability of the voting mechanism will be proven over time for all to see. However, your language leads me to believe even you are not certain enough to let this run with your hands off yet. Why not wait a month and properly track progress before deploying too prod. I don't see a super urgent need for this functionality that it can't wait.

3. I understand from a cost perspective why you're using AWS but injecting your seed into a lamba function sends the wrong message about what is and is not best practice. I don't think you would have any issues receiving donations for cycles (even directly to the canister).

**What is the ideal solution?**
Bottom line is I don't dislike this idea, but it does not feel ready. This is what I would like to see before you submit a proposal to add as a named neuron:

- Neuron controlled by a blackholed canister in which all logic is processed (you'll need HTTP requests and ECDSAt signatures)
- Reject vote to occur only at the end of the voting period (or after significant amount of time from start)
- Significantly more voting history to prove reliability of the programatic voting.
- Code review/audit of the automation canister performed by established developers from the ecosystem.

You've clearly put a lot of work into this already and have a solid understanding of how governance works on the internet computer. I would love to hear your thoughts on the above.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2022-08-21 16:04:19 UTC | #29

I would argue that if a protest neuron can garner more voting power than the DFINITY Foundation & the ICA - there is probably an issue worth halting operations to protest. 

Simultaneously, I don’t thinking lumping “stagnant” voting power & “protesting” voting power together is the right way to go about it, as it leads to a conflict of interests for the followee (I’m aware OP has a program to vote no, but it brings up some questions). Naturally, “protesting” voting power will have less regard for the short-term well-being of the NNS, as they’re discontent with something that’s happening. This is most likely not the case for stagnant voting power, in fact, it’s probable to assume that they’re simply trying to optimize rewards through following a neuron. 

Optimally, I’d like to see this split into two seperate neurons; one targeted at representing the best interests of stagnant voting power, and another that is dedicated solely to protesting by voting no.

-------------------------

@cryptoisgood @Accumulating.icp 


The scenario of gaining more than 50% seems so unrealistic to me that it's not really relevant. The foundation controls pretty much 100% of the voting power on other proposals. The most contested recent proposal like the community fund had only like 25% of the voting power. Big investors are really not going to follow to this neuron they are better off sending an email. 

@EasySteve 

In the FAQ I mention waiting till the end of the voting period is possible and that I want to go in that direction. Absolutely fine with only making the named neuron proposal only when that is the case. 

Fine with waiting for a bigger voting history as well. Note that there is only 100 of ballots saved on the neuron though. To verify a bigger history we will need a third party to make screenshots or the dashboard or something for the ones that got deleted. 


```
/// The maximum number of recent ballots to keep, per neuron.
pub const MAX_NEURON_RECENT_BALLOTS: usize = 100;
```

The question is would any credible devs like you be willing to put in the effort of verifying this code? I would be happy to collaborate in a public repo but this takes time and effort and we would need to await those features. 

I'm personally wouldn't like to wait for outgoing http request, threshold EDSA and the writing of that complicated code. I would also rather have neurons just be owned by canisters if people are willing to go through alternative hoops. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-remove-the-is-self-authenticating-restriction-on-neuron-ownership/14948/23

I personally feel like there is a hurry because the fact the foundation doesn't seem to take it like a signal at all that some of these proposals like maturity modulation or Community Fund that get rejected by all community neurons and barely make it and are still being pushed through. I would like for this neuron to exist before there is another contentious proposal. 

I just scanned the forum a bit and we could also create a neuron like this: 

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-create-a-decentralized-community-neuron/12564 

Then have the following setup

Have you me and another trusted community dev setup a 2 out of 3 following relation for the manage neuron topic and have it follow my proxy neuron with the lambda function. 

This way we would have checks and balances where the most important base neuron would be controlled by established community devs. The proxy neuron would be controlled by me and the lambda function. And we would have a roadmap towards fully trustless in the feature by adding a hotkey to a canister later. 

I really don't think having it not fully trustless from the start is a major problem because any yes vote wouldn't hold any weight from a neuron called **Always Reject**. I'm not looking for power as their is no power with such a neuron. So I'm happy to hand over control to more established devs so I can stay anonymous. 

If you would be willing to work together on this that would be fantastic, but I can imagine you don't have the time. I'm already a bit demotivated at this point as it is far from clear whether it would pass with this additional effort .

Thank you for engaging in the deliberation on your proposal.  I am becoming much more comfortable with your new anonymous identity because it is clear that you are an active participant in the IC ecosystem and governance discussions.  I also appreciate how thorough you have been in scoping your plans and providing the justification.  It has quickly elevated your credibility.  I think you are addressing my two biggest concerns by changing the neuron name and by letting the community get to know you through this deliberation.

[quote="Always_Votes, post:30, topic:14992"]

[/quote]
I think you are right that there is no credible scenario right now because all protocol changes happen in proposal topics that fall under All Topics Except Governance.  However, my concern in [bullet point 5 above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/named-neuron-proposal-always-votes/14992/6?u=wpb) was in reference to the day that individual topics are removed from All Topics since there will likely be far less total voting power casting votes until neuron owners are incentivized to select a Followee for that proposal topic (and since DFINITY voting power is going down daily).  I recognize that [your rebuttal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/named-neuron-proposal-always-votes/14992/12?u=wpb) was that we have no idea how proposal topics will be decentralized.  However, I'd prefer to plan for it happening the same way that Governance was partially decentralized.  There have not been any other ideas that have surfaced on how to decentralize individual proposal topics and it seems likely that they will follow the same model as Governance.  Working with that assumption, can you programmatically stop voting NO to proposals when that proposal topic no longer falls into the All Topics Except Governance catch all category?  Can you routinely scan the NNS code and look for the proposal topics that are included with All Topics?  If the proposal topic is removed, would you be willing to change your automated action so you no longer vote NO on protocol changes?  It would be helpful to know that your open source code has this feature.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-08-21 20:14:12 UTC | #34

I see so an example of your concern is:

- DFINITY removes the Network Economics Proposal topic from All topics besides Governance
- A much smaller pecentage is voting on this now 
- Such a small percentage that **Always Rejects** now blocks any proposal

Honestly I would be wildly against such a thing happening. Doing this with motion proposals that don't affect anything is one thing. Doing it with a topic that actually affect the protocol in such a way that this scenario seems even somewhat likely is bananas. I would be happy to be a detractor to such an idea. 

I think everybody is far too eager to make changes to the NNS that affect staking or the way voting works. In any proper democracy there are checks and balances so that you can't just affect the way the governance system works with a simple majority. Doing what you are suggesting should never be done in a way were people who were following the foundation are unfollowed.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-08-22 11:48:37 UTC | #35

I don't think blindly rejecting every proposal is constructive for governance, so I'm not in favor of this as a known neuron and will vote to reject.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-22 12:01:51 UTC | #36

I like the idea, good lateral thinking, so I will vote to accept, though not sure I will follow. The conversation does bring up the fact that established named neurons now have some interest in blocking other named neurons to the extent that they are competitors for followers.
Perhaps we need a separate named neuron vote category which is reward-free, so nobody loses for not voting on it, but also accepts only individual votes rather than automatic ones. That will prevent block voting and level the playing field a little.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-08-22 12:04:31 UTC | #37

If I assume the best case scenario, stakeholders would only follow this neuron when they've lost faith in the network. This could be an interesting way to gauge sentiment. It would be interesting to see how quickly this neuron gains or loses VP over time.

 @bjoern 

Is the neuron from this post  https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-create-a-decentralized-community-neuron/12564 still available? I would love to just use that one instead of going through all those steps.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-08-22 19:58:56 UTC | #39

I will update the script to only vote at the end of a voting period before making my proposal so everybody can vote manually.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-08-23 08:25:04 UTC | #40

Indeed, no one has claimed that neuron so far.

TBH I am not entirely sure about the gains from having this decentralized setup for your proposed neuron:
- The decentralized setup primarily makes sense if your organization consists of multiple people and you want to make changes to the setup of the neuron by threshold voting. If you control this neuron through a _single_ other neuron, there is really no advantage in doing so.
- If your neuron votes automatically through a script on AWS, then the voting (which seems to be the important part here) is centralized anyway, even if you had multiple people controlling the neuron.

To me, this seems to be a case where the "right" setup seems to be:
- Have a [canister control the neuron](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-remove-the-is-self-authenticating-restriction-on-neuron-ownership/14948).
- Instead of hosting the script on AWS, build the same functionality in that canister.
- Give up central control over your canister by (a) blackholing it, (b) putting it under DAO control, or (c) letting the canister control itself.

That said, if you think this is the proper setup for your neuron, I don't mind sending you the one I created. Just send me the id of the neuron that you want to control it with, and I'll configure it so it's from then on exclusively controlled by your neuron. (And you can then again change the setup so that it's controlled by multiple independent neurons.)

Note that the NNS frontend dapp currently does not support neuron management proposals, so you'd need to be able to use your existing neuron from `dfx` or `ic-repl` in order to send management proposals.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-08-23 19:11:27 UTC | #41

Have a [canister control the neuron ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-remove-the-is-self-authenticating-restriction-on-neuron-ownership/14948).

Is the foundation going to enable this without using EDSCA and outgoing requests soon? 

I was thinking the community neuron that you created could function as the basis for a decentralised ownership in the future. 

So initially I would be the only followee on the manage neuron topic and it uses AWS lambda, but I think this way it is possible to make it progressively trustless in the future by:

- adding more neurons to "Manage Neuron" topic making it act as a sort of neuron multisig
- Change the following of other topics to a blackholed voting canister later. 

Would this be possible?

A neuron cannot literally follow a canister, but the canister could be registered as a "voting hot key" for the neuron so the canister could cast votes.

It is possible to change the "voting" neuron to being fully controlled by the canister in the future: create another neuron that is controlled by said canister, then set up "voting" neuron management to follow the canister's neuron, so the "canister" can control the voting neuron indirectly. It's just a bit more complex than it would need to be, and each manage neuron proposal costs 0.01 ICP, but that shouldn't really matter since I'd expect hardly be any changes to the neuron configuration in your scenario.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-10-19 20:12:08 UTC | #44

The proposal here:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/87142

Is indeed from me. I wanted to bring this named neuron fully onchain first, but decided that perfect is the enemy of good. 

I think taking the noise out of motion proposals is by far the most important purpose of **Always Rejects**. And since motion proposals don't affect the protocol directly it seems safe to have the automation running on centralised infrastructure. 

If I ever vote Accept you can disregard the voting power that came with it. I updated the FAQ on my website but couldn't edit the forum post anymore.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-10-19 20:53:01 UTC | #45

Thank you for naming your neuron Always Rejects instead of Always Votes.  I appreciate your reasoning behind why you want this named neuron and the compromises you are making so it can happen now.  Makes total sense.  I could never follow a neuron whose purpose is to always reject, but I also don’t think it’s my place to stand in the way of anyone else who is attracted to the voting policy you are offering.  I will vote to accept your named neuron proposal.

In the proposal it says

> I decided in the end that I would rather have the automation run every couple hours so that if something goes wrong I still have days to make sure the neuron votes on everything.

I think this use case that you give:

> This neuron also originally had the purpose to offer a way for people to default reject unless they want to vote Accept manually themselves.

is very useful but impossible if the neuron votes already after a couple of hours. If you automate it through a canister then (I guess) you can achieve automatic voting towards the end of the voting period.

-------------------------

Always_Votes | 2022-10-21 21:52:41 UTC | #48

I can update the automation later to check the proposal time and only vote after 3 days. However I think voting on every proposal is the most important promise for most people. I would want to add some extra redundancy before going that route as I would only have a day to notice if something went wrong. 

I don't really have the time right now to put in that extra effort. In the meanwhile I think the current setup could still be valuable as people seem way too eager at the moment to change tokenomics and are making the wildest proposals.

Which recent tokenomic proposal do you consider wild?  

There are no current tokenomics proposals.  

The last one that passed was [proposal 80970](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80970) and it was well deliberated over a reasonable timeframe and passed 49.4% approve to 0.4% reject.  Hence, it doesn’t seem the governing body thought it was very wild.

I don’t mind submitting a proposal to rename the neuron in a similar way to what @LightningLad91 did for TheFoolsCourt to let people know it’s not an active named neuron.  

This seems reasonable IMO:
Inactive (Request Removal) - formerly Always Rejects

If @Always_Votes doesn’t reply to this message in the next couple of weeks, does anyone object if I (or anyone else) submits a proposal that renames the Always Rejects neuron in this way?

The person behind this neuron seemed very familiar with ICP governance at the time.  Perhaps they will see this forum topic now that it has surfaced again and be willing to rename their neuron themselves.  That would certainly be the best option.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-05-10 09:08:04 UTC | #54

It seems to me that currently the 'Always Rejects' neuron, which doesn't vote (and which is hardly watched by anyone) is the least of the problems in terms of governance structure.
Let's think @wpb about who should be on this official list (or not) but they isn't on it. I mean ICA and DFINITY, which are displayed in the NNS Dapp, even though they didn't pass the vote and aren't even listed in the list of 'Known Neurons' in the NNS Governance canister!
They should be immediately removed (I mean neurons 27 & 28) from the NNS Dapp because they aren't officially registered as 'Known Neurons' and (if they want further decentralization) they shouldn't apply for inclusion by official vote. In this early stage of decentralization they have too much liquid voting power to treat they as one of the 'possible options' and not as an absolute.
