Dfinity Foundation being Swiss Non-Profit must have provided statues to Supervisory Authority of Foundations.

I request Dfinity Foundation to provide those statues to the community here so that we can all be re-assured that Dfinity Foundation values are reflective of our beliefs.

If Dfinity Foundation does not want to provide these statues,  could they explain why?

@diegop : can you please take this up?

@CashBowie is correct. Please note I had no idea where to find any of this info. We asked Legal and this is what they graciously gave us.

To be helpful, I found the direct link:

Thank you for your timely response. Hopefully this will reassure the IC eco-system.
