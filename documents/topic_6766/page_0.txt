Hi, 

I deployed a website to the IC following the steps [here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html). Basically I created a canister with the default identity via the sdk and now I want to link that canister to my other, NNS, identity. I ran the following command: 
```
dfx wallet --network ic add-controller <My principal id> 
``` 
The command worked but I can't access the details of the canister via NNS.

Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong or has experienced the same?
