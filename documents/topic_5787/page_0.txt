So i set up a cycles wallet on the IC under my local default role.

dfx ledger --network ic create-canister someID --amount .5 

Then i mistakenly created another one 

dfx ledger --network ic create-canister someID --amount .5 

I wish to move the cycles from the second wallet from the first but when i run ....

dfx wallet addresses

..... it returns the first cycles wallet, therefore how can i switch the context to the second wallet and then send the cycles to the first. Then i will delete the second cycles wallet canister.

Look for wallets.json in your .dfx directory. Make a copy of the old value!

Yep done that.

So my question is how do i access the second wallet container i created so i can move the cycles ?

As at present when ever i run ..

dfx wallet addresses

â€¦ it returns the first cycles wallet.

The other odd thing is that when i try to access it via.

https://my-second-wallet-conatiner-address.ic0.app/

..... the page wont load.
