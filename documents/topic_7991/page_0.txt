Probably a silly question, but what's the benefit of having a separate `UserId` instead of have everything rely on just `Principal`?

For example, CanCan explicitly [states](https://github.com/dfinity/cancan/blob/031f31c0f45af72e42416043e1a2415642844d4e/backend/Access.mo#L54) that a principal may be authorized with multiple usernames (i.e. user IDs) and a single username may be shared among multiple principals.

When would that be useful? If a user's `Principal` was per-session and thus constantly changing, then I would see the point. But for most authentication schemes like Internet Identity (or Torus, which I'm using), the `Principal` is stable. Same login credentials, same `Principal`.

If someone wanted to create a new account, they would create a new identity anchor on II, which would map to a new `Principal`. How would they even associate multiple user IDs with a single `Principal`?

Any thoughts? Thanks.
