I got error as I ran my `dfx deploy user_canister`
```
error: linking with `rust-lld` failed: exit status: 1

````

here is my code https://github.com/aliscie/odoc/commit/263205f1fa4ece646ac28162cc0cb0a46e55ecca

any ideas ?
I already tried 
1. `cargo clean` and `rustup update`
2. `rustup toolchain install nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin`
3. `dfx self update`
4. ```
rm Cargo.lock
rm -rf target
cargo build

```
