Hi there! We have been thinking about how to more deeply involve the community when it comes to the Internet Computer. As such, we are starting a new initiative called âœ¨[Community Conversations](https://dfinity.org/conversations/)âœ¨. 

This is a series of webinars hosted on Zoom to talk through and get your thoughts on technical updates & ongoing progress with the Internet Computer ecosystem. Of course, there will also be the opportunity for Q&A with the speakers. Yours truly will be moderating each of the Community Conversation talks ðŸ’•

First up in our Community Conversations series, we have the following topics:

* **Motoko Playground**: Yan Chen - Senior Software Engineer (Languages)
* **Staking & Neurons**: John Wiegley - Principal Software Engineer (SDK)
* **Canisters in Rust**: Roman Kashitsyn - Senior Software Engineer (Message Routing)
* **Increased Canister Storage**: Akhi Singhania - Engineering Manager (Execution)
* **Introduction to Building on the Internet Computer**: Igor Lilic & Liz Yang - Senior Developer Relations Engineer & Developer Ecosystem Program Manager

You can get the full list of upcoming Community Conversations, as well as register [here](https://dfinity.org/conversations/). Seating is limited per session, but each session will be recorded and published to YouTube after!

Please note that you do need a Zoom account to participate (you can obtain an account for free). Looking forward to seeing you there! ðŸ¥³
