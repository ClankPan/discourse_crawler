If I sell my identity in idgeek.
Will the sale be made without my approval at the first offer I receive?
If I don't like the offer, won't the sale be made?
Thankyou.

If it is below your requested amount it should give you the option to accept or decline, so that you have the ability to entertain higher offers.
