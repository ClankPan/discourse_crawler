When utilizing heap and stable structure memory with the stable structure crate ([https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures)), how can I determine the size of the heap and the stable memory separately?

While `canister_status()` seems to provide the overall memory usage, I'm interested in finding how to differentiate between the two.

Basically I want to display a user: total size zzzz Mb of which heap size xxxx Mb, stable size yyyy Mb.

Looks like there is [`ic_cdk::api::stable::stable_size`](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/stable/fn.stable_size.html) (thanks @Manu!)

You can also get the size of the heap memory specifically using [`memory_size`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/arch/wasm/fn.memory_size.html) from the Rust standard library. Note that the return value is the size in Wasm pages.
