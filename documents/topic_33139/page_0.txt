We believe the UTOPIA initiative will be very important to the Internet Computer ecosystem, and have collected a lot of questions from interested community members. Rather than answer these piecemeal, we are working to put these into a reasonably comprehensive FAQ that provides good coverage. UTOPIA is a new initiative still in the early stages. The initiative has been perfecting ways to make it easier for enterprises and governments to create private ICP networks, and connecting to potential users to get feedback, and not much else, which is why there is little more than a holding page and a deck explaining the technology currently. The FAQ will be new material, and we want to make it comprehensive, and practically speaking, that means it will hit the forum some time next week. In the meantime, thanks for your patience and support, weâ€™re looking to sharing developments with you.
