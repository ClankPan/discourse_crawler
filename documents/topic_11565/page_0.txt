Hi everyone, 

Noob in motoko here, I've been building out an application and learning at my own pace. 

I quickly learned about sudograph which is very cool but I noticed all the examples build the query from the front end. 

Do we have a query builder tool for sudograph in motoko? 

While on topic has anyone built any validation utility?

Have you seen the following examples/documentation?

* https://github.com/sudograph/sudograph/tree/main/examples/motoko-client
* https://i67uk-hiaaa-aaaae-qaaka-cai.raw.ic0.app/authorization.html#motoko-authorization

Also @ayjayem I believe has experience with using Sudograph and Motoko in an actual project, perhaps he can shed some more light on practical usage.

Yeah I did see that I was hoping some one made some kind of query builder tool that generates the string so I donâ€™t have to ðŸ˜‚.

Yeah there are no GraphQL query builder tools for Motoko. Motoko is very young and doesn't have very many libraries at all, definitely no GraphQL libraries that I know of.

Good news is that Azle https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle is coming along very well, and since it allows you to write canisters in TypeScript/JavaScript, you should then be able to use many of the GraphQL tools that people have already built, I assume there are some more mature GraphQL query builders by now.

Personally I like to just write my GraphQL directly, and I have VS Code plugins that do type-checking on them.

Oo I didnâ€™t even consider using typescript, thanks!

Keep in mind that Azle is alpha software but you can definitely try it out now

haha, if I was deterred by alpha software I would be coding Spring Boot Apps

@lastmjs @alejandrade

Apologies for the late reply on this! @alejandrade, please reach out if you'd like - not an expert by any means, but I've been working with Sudograph over the past months, and love it. Would be happy to offer whatever I can to others who could benefit as well.
