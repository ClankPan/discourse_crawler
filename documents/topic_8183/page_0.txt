I just received my new Macbook running OSX 12.0 (Monterey) and I am not able to install DFX. What I see so far is that the `install.sh` only goes to version 11.*.

```
macbook@MacBook-Pro ~ % DFX_VERSION=0.8.3 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
info: Executing dfx install script, commit: d0f6a33c6c1ef2563d7b5701015c3b4a33b070ab
info: Version found: 0.8.3
info: Creating uninstall script in ~/.cache/dfinity
info: uninstall path=/Users/macbook/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
info: Checking for latest release...
warn: Detected OS X platform older than 10.13 (High Sierra)
warn: Not forcing TLS v1.2, this is potentially less secure
```

It hangs at the last line.

(I already tried to add 12.0 to the list, but its keeps showing the same behavior)

Could somebody maybe help figuring this out?

Thanks

i finally managed to fix it, i just added the version to the install.sh and waited a long time
