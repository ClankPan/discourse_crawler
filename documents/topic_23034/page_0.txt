I have seen the problem, we should reconsider the role of node providers, they are also investors, they also need to take risks, not full-time staff guaranteed 100% profitability, we hold ICPs have no obligation to support them!

I dont think its a death spiral, i saw a post on twitter where its a few neurons dumping every month. Will try to find and share here.  No idea why that would benefit anyone but seems to be what is happening...
