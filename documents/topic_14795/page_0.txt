Is `post_install` supposed to work in dfx 0.11.0?

Here's my `dfx.json`:

```json
{
    "canisters": {
        "icrc_1": {
            "type": "custom",
            "build": "npx azle icrc_1",
            "root": "src",
            "ts": "src/index.ts",
            "candid": "src/index.did",
            "wasm": "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/icrc_1.wasm",
            "declarations": {
                "output": "test/dfx_generated/icrc_1"
            },
            "post_install": [
                "dfx generate",
                "scripts/modify_last_line.sh test/dfx_generated"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
I can't ever get the `post_install` scripts to run, I've put them in different locations in the `dfx.json` and nothing so far has worked.

I've been using the following commands, I assume `post_install` will run after any `dfx canister install` command.

```bash
dfx canister install --argument "($argument)" --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/icrc_1.wasm.gz icrc_1

dfx canister install --mode upgrade --argument "($argument)" --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/icrc_1.wasm.gz icrc_1
```

Yes, it looks like when using the `--wasm` flag, `dfx canister install` does not run the post-install scripts.

The `--wasm ` flag is meant as a way to install arbitrary wasm into an arbitrary canister.  It's subtle, but the help for the option mentions this:

> Specifies a particular WASM file to install, bypassing the dfx.json project settings.

In your case, since the wasm field matches the canister definition, if you remove the `--wasm` parameter from the command you're running, dfx will still install the same wasm, but also run the post-install scripts.
