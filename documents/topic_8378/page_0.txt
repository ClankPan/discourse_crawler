Hello everyone!

AstroX is releasing a bounty for Dart developers to enhance agent_dart and related tooling. 

The goal is to build a candid builder for agent_dart.

Candid is used to describe IDL for canister functions.
Candid builder is used to transform candid files to usable functions/classes for agent clients in different languages.
For dart language, all interfaces are classes. To make a workable builder, like we do json decoding classes, the candid builder should also transform all those interfaces into classes.
