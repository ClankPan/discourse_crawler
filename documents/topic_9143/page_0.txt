Currently, the official advise is to always stop your canisters before upgrading them. This advise is well justified, but the result is quite unsatisfactory, and unbecoming of a service hosting platform that wants to attract "real" applications.

So in this blog post I explore how to write canisters that can be safely upgraded without stopping, both now and once [the System API has improved](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/prioritize-safe-instantaneous-canister-upgrades/9039):

Are there any plans of using something like "validUntil" or other timestamp-based mechanism where the message is dropped by the replica if it comes too late?
