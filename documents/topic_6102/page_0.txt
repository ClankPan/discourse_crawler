Hi, anyone here on the verified app subnet has spare canisters to trade? I am blocked by cycles sending capabilities because I need a way to be able to send cycles to ANY canister on ANY subnet. This is related to my early thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/call-for-action-establish-a-common-cycles-transfer-interface/5871?u=quinto

I don't mind paying. Please PM if you can help. Just assign the controller of the canister to my principal id will do: de5xo-ggpwz-skaxk-mcmen-ewovl-xaas2-4hv6m-5zvjs-omjgs-uh5lt-dae. Thanks!
