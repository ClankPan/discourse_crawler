## Bounty Details

* Bounty Amount: 100 ICP
* Project Type: Single Contributor
* Opened: 12/17/2021
* Time Commitment: Days
* Project Type: Traditional
* Experience Type: Intermediate - Web Dev; Intermediate - API Integration
* Issue Type: Application Development

## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn how DAB works
* learn how Stoic wallet works
* learn how to cross call different services and standards on the IC


[DAB](https://docs.dab.ooo/nft-list/getting-started/_) is a service that allows NFT developers to register their canister and type of standard used with a central repository. Once submitted to DAB, a simple interface can be used to retrieve all of a user's NFT, send NFTs, and to get token details.

[Stoic wallet](https://stoicwallet.com) is a popular wallet used to interact with Etrepot and other Toniq labs based applications. The current process for adding new NFTs to Stoic wallet is to submit a pull request at github(https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/stoic-wallet) that specifically handles the NFT canister's NFT implementation or to implement a number of Stoic specific functions into the canister and add the canister manually by principle ID.

This integration would allow the stoic wallet to query DAB for existing collections that are in the registry and display the NFTs without having to submit a pull request or to manually add the canister and hope the get_tokens function is defined.

Requirements:

1.  Have stoic wallet query getAllgetUserTokens in DAB and append those items to the ones that stoic already finds.  Search for duplicates and remove them.
2.  Keep track of if the NFT is in DAB and use DAB's transfer function to call transfer if it is a DAB listed token.
3.  Use DAB's details function to get info and show it when a user clicks on an NFT in stoic wallet and wants to see details.

To claim the award you must produce a pull request for stoic wallet that adds this functionality and is accepted by the Toniq labs team.  Reach out to Bob or Easy Steve if you have any questions.

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work writing tutorials and any other open-source contributions(ie. your github).
* Include a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding

The bounty was generously funded by DAB/Psycadelic(40 ICP), Toniq Labs(40 ICP), and a Foundation Accelerator of 20 more ICP. If you would like to turbocharge this bounty you can seed additional donations of ICP to 66083bb3c940c7de2a70aa127ec771da75d60deadc10f5f66b280f203d8f6e73.  ICDevs will match the bounty 1:1 for the first 40 ICP out of the DFINITY grant and then 0.25:1 after that.  All donations will be tax-deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.  If you send a donation and need a donation receipt, please email the hash of your donation transaction, physical address, and name to donations@icdevs.org.  More information about how you can contribute can be found at our [donations page](https://icdevs.org/donations.html).


## General Bounty Process

### Discussion

The draft bounty is posted to the DFINITY developer's forum for discussion

### Ratification

The developer advisor's board will propose a bounty be ratified and a vote will take place to ratify the bounty.  Until a bounty is ratified by the Dev it hasn't been officially adopted. Please take this into consideration if you are considering starting early.

### Open for application

Developers can submit applications to the Dev Forum post.  The council will consider these as they come in and propose a vote to award the bounty to one of the applicants.  If you would like to apply anonymously you can send an email to austin at icdevs dot org or sending a PM on the dev forum.

### Assigned

A developer is currently working on this bounty, you are free to contribute, but any splitting of the award will need to be discussed with the currently assigned developer.

### In Review

The Dev Council is reviewing the submission

### Awarded

The award has be been given and the bounty is closed.

If no one has applied yet, I would like to work one this.

I have a question, the integration requires only working on the stoic wallet javascript side or it requires other work on the motoko backend side?

-------------------------

[My Github profile](https://github.com/tarek-eg)

* [Dab's documentation](https://docs.dab.ooo/nft-list/getting-started/) explains how to get the users NFTs.
Currently stoic wallet is using [a hard coded list](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/stoic-wallet/blob/4d8bf515e50c3136eb47f8e8192555c88945658a/src/ic/collections.js#L1) of tokens to communicate the nft list.
DAB-js library provides an api to query users tokens so probably I will have to find a way to merge both ways together or just use a custom react hook to fetch DABs tokens and merge it with stoic's one.
Using a custom hook is a good way for encapsulating the logic and allow for a DRY principal.
* The feature should be ready within a **week or 10 days** maximum

That is fantastic.  Thanks for the updates.

The PR is open for review.
The last point is not clear for me, is it something that's already implemented in stoic or a new functionality? Do you have an example for it?
Otherwise DAB's NFTS are on bar with the stoic ones and you can click on the NFT and it will open the image in a new tab.

Use DABâ€™s details function to get info and show it when a user clicks on an NFT in stoic wallet and wants to see details.

If you look at https://docs.dab.ooo/nft-list/getting-started/#gettokendetails-fetch-the-details-of-any-specific-token-on-a-collection you'll see that there is a function to pull metadata.  I actually don't know what this metadata looks like, but I'm guessing it is just json data?  You could probably just put a code block underneath the pic of the NFT and output a pretty print of the json?  I think that would suffice for now.  If sotic wants to eventually pull the data out and display it in another way they can add that later.  I don't think there is a good standard for meta data at the moment so that may have to wait until later.

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-12-27 16:45:09 UTC | #10

The metadata is actually a part of the response from `getAllUserNFTs` call, so the data is actually already there and it's just a matter of displaying it.
For now I can display it as a tool tip with some pre checks when a user hover over the image.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-12-27 16:50:50 UTC | #11

That sounds like a good compromise.... hmm...what about mobile though?

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-12-27 17:02:06 UTC | #12

I actually just noticed that stoic is displaying the metadata already.

![image|622x143](upload://w5NwbuaaQ0ulPKFt9TwfTgk10mn.png)

So I don't think that we need to do anything here other than support displaying a json object if available.

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-12-27 17:40:59 UTC | #13

The PR is updated and ready for review.
