**Dual-Token Economics with Elixir**: ELNA introduces a dual-token system, with Elixir serving as a utility token within the ELNA platform. Similar to cycles in the Internet Computer, Elixir empowers the creation of customized chatbots and facilitates AI interactions. This unique approach enhances the usability and sustainability of our ecosystem.


**ELNA LBP Now Live in Sonic**: The Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) for ELNA is now live on Sonic.

This is a golden opportunity for investors! Here are the advantages:

* **LBP 1 Supporters**: Get ready for a 20x reward! Every token bought during LBP 1 will be multiplied by 20, providing a remarkable return on investment.

* **LBP 2 Supporters**: Even if you miss LBP 1, there's still a chance to benefit. LBP 2 supporters will receive a 5x reward for their participation.
* **Elixir Airdrop**: That's not all! Every token holder will also receive an airdrop of Elixir, our utility token. Elixir is the fuel that powers ELNA's AI ecosystem, enabling the creation of custom chatbots and enhancing AI interactions.

**ELNA Timeline for the Future**:

* **Q1-Q2**: Foundation Building (Done)
* **Q1**: Focus on establishing the core infrastructure of ELNA.

AI examples available for the IC are using Burn-rs. Burn-rs has limited ONNX functionality. Can you speak to what Rust crate you are using?

But anyone with a bit of common sense knows that this simply cannot be done.

HI @hehe , 

Totally get where you're coming from ‚Äì it's a wild ride trying to fit those big language models into the Internet Computer ecosystem. üöÄ Initially, we were like, "Whoa, instruction limits, memory struggles, where's the GPU party at?" üòÖ

But hold onto your hat, because Dominic spilled the beans on some seriously cool behind-the-scenes action. Check out his posts ‚Äì they're like the backstage pass to the ICP magic show.

We've been straight shooters in our AMAs, podcasts, and posts, admitting it might sound impossible. However, things are flipping around, and we're riding this wave of change. üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So, buckle up and dive into those posts ‚Äì they might just change your "hehe" into a "whoa"! üåü
