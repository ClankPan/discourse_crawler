Hello,

I was just wondering if something like onedrive or google drive is possible on the internet computer, so people need to pay for example 5 ckusdc a month, to get a decentrelized cloud storage.

I see openchat as a competitor to whatsapp
hot or not as a competitor to tiktok
DSCVR as a competitor to X

but i never see a project trying to compete with google drive or onedrive

Is it achievable?

Hi, I believe **[IC Drive](https://twitter.com/icDrive)** might be one of the projects you're looking for - the current GUI is quite basic but it seems that upgrade is in progress and already you get 4GB of space. Also I suppose with new types of ICP subnets the functionality will get extended:

Another one might be **[Dmail Network](https://twitter.com/Dmailofficial)**, but no idea when the **`Decentralized Drive`** is launched, also not sure if the data storage will be on ICP as Dmail is a multichain project:

Another project I have been working on as a side project is Web3Disk.app

It is focussed on full ownership, security, e2e encryption, privacy etc. and less so on storage capacity and large files.

Allthough large storage and large files is possible, its more expensive and not the target market for this app.

With file system api in browsers, file sync with the os filesystem is possoble, like with google drive for example.

And the thing Im most excited about, which is interesting for all dapps, not just storage dapps, is the ability for the user to 'click&own' their canister within a minute with only a Internet Identity
