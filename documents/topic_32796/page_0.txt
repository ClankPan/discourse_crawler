I'm reading the [SNS.yaml example](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/sns/cli/sns_init_template.yaml) file linked on the IC portal and I'm comparing it to recent Snses Yaml files such as WaterNeuron or IC Footprint. I noticed that the fields to specify the minimum and maximum swap ICP are not similar.

This is what is provided by the foundation:

```
# The minimum number of ICP that is required for a decentralization swap to
    # succeed. This number divided by the number of SNS tokens being offered
    # gives the reserve price of the swap, i.e., the minimum number of ICP per
    # SNS token. If this amount is not achieved, the swap will fail. This field
    # is specified as a token. For instance, "1 token".
    minimum_icp: ~

    # The maximum number of ICP that is targeted by this decentralization swap.
    # If this amount is achieved with sufficient participation, the swap will
    # succeed immediately, without waiting for the deadline. This means that
    # a participant knows the minimum number of SNS tokens received per invested
    # ICP. If this amount is achieved without reaching `minimum_participants`,
    # the swap will immediately fail without waiting for the due date. This
    # field is specified as a token. For instance, "1 token".
    maximum_icp: ~
```

That's what's used by the Snses:

```
# Minimum amount of ICP from direct participants. This amount is required for
    # the swap to succeed. If this amount is not achieved, the swap will be
    # aborted (instead of committed) when the due date/time occurs.
    # Must be smaller than or equal than `maximum_direct_participation_icp`.
    minimum_direct_participation_icp: 200_000 tokens

    # Maximum amount of ICP from direct participants. If this amount is achieved,
    # the swap will finalize immediately, without waiting for the due date/time;
    # in this case, the swap would be committed if and only if the number of
    # direct participants (`minimum_participants`) is reached (otherwise, it
    # would be aborted).
    # Must be at least `min_participants * minimum_direct_participation_icp`.
    maximum_direct_participation_icp: 350_000 tokens
```

Which naming is correct? Or maybe both are accepted?

Hi @peterparker, the sns_init_template.yaml file you linked to is obsolete, I think we're going to remove it very soon. Thanks for pointing out this discrepancy. 

Accordingly, `{minimum, maximum}_icp` is obsolete, `{minimum, maximum}_direct_participation_icp` is to be used (this is because the Neurons' Fund participation can only be _requested_, but a specific participation _amount_ cannot be set by the team launching an SNS).

The most complete documentation for the currently-supported fields should be here: https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/example_sns_init.yaml

(We're planning to eventually have the source of truth for the SNS init template also in the mono repo; let's see when we have time to make that transition).

Thanks for the explanation. You might want to fix the Internet Computer website ([here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/tokenomics/preparation/#initial-parameters)) that points to the obsolete resource.

Thank you, it will be fixed with [this PR](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/3178).
