EDIT: vote here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/87478

After seeing some people make ludicrous suggestions, saying things like “we should unlock all seed investors neurons right now”, as an MA economist I have a counter proposal:

All seed investors’ neurons which have not yet unlocked should be automatically staked for 8 years.

This would stop the monthly dumps of several millions of ICP. Rewards would remain on their current schedule. This would stop or significantly slow the outward shift of the supply curve, which might be enough to cause price to stop falling.

Please note that even if the demand curve does not change but the supply curve continues to shift outward, price will fall. I believe investors are hesitant to increase investment into ICP in part because of the periodic unlocking of new tokens.

With the outward shift in the supply curve arrested, investors would show confidence in the future of ICP. New money would flow into the token, shifting the demand curve outward and allowing price to increase.

Suggesting that we should simply unlock all tokens now and end the period of unlocks thusly is incredibly short-sighted. With over 100 million ICP suddenly unlocked, this shock could be enough to kill the coin and the project. Who would continue to invest? But with unlocks halted as I suggest, investors would feel more comfortable. Developers would come, as the fear of monthly dumps would be far removed.

With more investment and development we would enter a cycle of positive reinforcement, where the adjusted tokenomics would lead to further development and investment.

Now, with this said, how can I formally suggest this on the NNS? I am not a developer. I am merely a master of economics. And, what are your thoughts on the matter?

Thank you. I look forward to the discussion.

Finally a proposal helping retail

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 19:16:32 UTC | #5

Please vote YES on 87478 to lock seed neurons for 8 years.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/87478

Also remember it only costs 10 ICP to submit a proposal if it loses. Maybe more retail users could make proposals that could actually help our prospects rather than those of initial investors.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-20 19:45:09 UTC | #7

The obvious issue with this is that DFINITY's neurons are seed neurons as well and they are the only source of non-VC funding at the moment.

What about using a carrot instead of a stick and offering an instant 25%(or some other number) bonus to any seeds that lock for 8 years?  I mean, that is already in the tokenomics sort of, but obviously the reward doesn't outweigh the present value or more people would be doing it(many have...see the new years eve stake last year).

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-10-20 19:47:17 UTC | #8

What will this mean for future investors tho? If you can have your neuron forcibly put into a 8 year lock up, I would be hesitant to invest at all.

-------------------------

anonymous | 2022-10-20 19:48:09 UTC | #9

Disclaimer: I'm not a seed investor. I have an 8 year neuron with XXXX ICP, so I really want the best for ICP. 

With that being said, this is a selfishly bad proposal that I will be voting no to. I'm not for early unlocks nor forcing them to be locked longer. When we sign the smart contracts, they must be honored. Pulling a shady switcheroo like that would be extremely bad.

It's not the same; the premise is, but how would you feel if someone created a proposal where you can never unlock your funds? You would be pretty upset about it, wouldn't you? And this is purely driven by self interest. You want them locked in for 8 years just so you can have some gains? If you're an 8 year staker, why care of where the price is now? 

Seed investors have the right to do whatever they want with THEIR ICP, whether it be selling or hodling. This proposal is proposing an artificial way to manipulate things, which no guarantee that it would be effective and could cause harm to the reputation of the project.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 19:56:53 UTC | #10

These neurons would receive maturity from their locked neurons. They would be just fine.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 19:58:11 UTC | #11

The capability already exists on NNS. This isn’t a new thing, it’s something that investors have always known could happen.

But it would only apply to seed investors. How much did they pay for their ICP again?

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-10-20 20:00:55 UTC | #12

Are seed investors the $4 group or the three cent group?

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 20:12:25 UTC | #13

I believe both groups are included.

People are saying it would be unfair to seed investors. I say what’s unfair is that people paid $.03 per ICP and dump millions on us each month, forcing new lows on the community and discouraging investors and developers from even trying to enter the ecosystem.

With the passage of this proposal we will have eliminated, mitigated, or staved off the greatest supply-side pressure on ICP. An increasing price lifts all boats, including those of the seed investors (who will still receive maturity on their investment).

-------------------------

ohsalmeron | 2022-10-20 20:25:51 UTC | #14

I don't have much voting power but here are my 2 cents,

A contract is a mutual agreement and it must be honored, but it can be re-negotiated.

We would need to propose a win-win situation for everyone and giving the results, a clear exit strategy for seed investors (if that's what they're looking for)

In my opinion as a developer, we should let them go asap for good if they're not comfortable with their investment.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-10-20 20:31:29 UTC | #15

Still not a fan. Yeah it sucks, but you could also say we as new investors should have known about these unlocks and the fact some people bought for 3 cents. Rather let things stand as is and hope it will work out after a few years.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 20:31:41 UTC | #16

Once their neurons are locked, we would have lots of time to debate how best to move forward.

-------------------------

Seb | 2022-10-20 20:57:24 UTC | #17

The main issue is that most seed investors aren't investing in the ecosystem at the moment and seems pretty upset about the way the launch / listing was done.
There might have been errors and miscommunications that happened with DFINITY regarding seeds investors (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/seed-round-access/2765). 

We would all win a lot if some form of contact with seed investors was reestablished and all of us together could probably find a smart solution for the ecosystem. 
I know that Arthur Falls was working on this at some point. This could probably be done by someone (or some group) who has a lot of respect in the community, some early people that are more likely to have contact with seed investors.

Brutally locking them for 8-years doesn't seem like the best solution if we want to attract them back in the ecosystem. Those people are early believer of the IC and we need to convince them to come back.
Also there is the issue of DFINITY's neurons that are tagged seeds neurons so we would loose almost all source of funding in the ecosystem...

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 20:58:25 UTC | #18

Perhaps if they’re locked for eight years, they’ll take notice, come around and start offering ideas of their own?

-------------------------

Mathias | 2022-10-20 22:40:17 UTC | #19

Come on let’s not do this please. We‘d basically be screwing them to stop the price from going down.
You could argue they‘d have better incentives to create value when being forced locked. But the reputation loss of the NNS (or whoever controls it) would be much much greater. This won‘t establish coordination into the IC ecosystem but away from it.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 22:45:53 UTC | #20

What reputation, that our governance token has fallen 99.8% and we’ve done nothing to stop it?

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 22:52:47 UTC | #21

Has nobody here heard that VCs have caused ICP’s price to tank? This is the reputation of ICP. People think of ICP as a token pumped and dumped by initial investors.

We can stop the dumping.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2022-10-20 22:54:44 UTC | #22

We have like 22 million worth of vc/seed unlocks left. You should of proposed this whenever we had a 100 million+. The damaged is already done to the ecosystem.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-20 23:32:47 UTC | #23

It’s not too late to mitigate the remaining damage.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-10-21 00:36:46 UTC | #24

This is a horrible idea. Forcing investors to stake for 8 years sets a horrible precedent and will scare off all future investors for years to come. The best thing we can do for the ecosystem is to promote the many projects built on the IC and drive adoption.

DHemingway | 2022-10-21 01:22:11 UTC | #26

Thank you for posting this. I agree with you. Fact is an 8-year staker (I am one) does not care about price today. Inflation today doesn’t matter! Growing the network is the only thing that matters - if someone proposes to lock seed neurons Vote No.

-------------------------

lhblty | 2022-10-21 02:42:06 UTC | #27

Smaug you are against IC? This is the worst idea i ever see, YOU CANT PLAY WITH INVESTOR MONEY !  Maybe i will  make a proposal to take your icp and share it to all stakers, to have a compensation for low prices. I will vote right now NOOOOOO!

cfsostill | 2022-10-21 04:37:37 UTC | #30

Making them stake 8 years also makes them even richer in the long run. More rewards for them.

-------------------------

Choiseongin | 2022-10-21 05:07:09 UTC | #32

The real problem is allocating too many tokens to the seed rounders when genesis

Seed rounders were able to purchase a large amount of tokens that would destroy the ecosystem at 0.03

Even if they sell it now, the profit is more than 150 times

Ecosystem growth is insignificant and can't fill the dumping pressure and getting worse

For the sake of the ecosystem, they too must be held accountable

I participated in the dream of a fair decentralized internet, but it may not even exist from the beginning. Everything is driven by money

This proposal is a disaster. Regardless of the original tokenomics & allocations, playing god with any neuron unlock schedules would be a death sentence for the ICP token. I look forward to voting no on this proposal.

-------------------------

lhblty | 2022-10-21 05:34:41 UTC | #34

I think adjust node reward mechanism for a fixed amount of ICP rather than dollars, it is more feasible.

-------------------------

passio | 2022-10-21 09:29:55 UTC | #35

This is the worst post i have read since the begining ! I spent a lot of my money (my real money, not crypto gains) for ICP since it’s 80, 30, 20, 10, 7, 5$… and lock for 8 years this amount of money would be see as a tyrannical behaviour. I guess there is also ennemies of the project, ennemies of justice registered on this forum, and well, we have to deal with any kind of treat.

This is how marketing in crypto works, create fear when price is low, and hype when it’s high… and then, you are probably the side of the fear. This proposal is evil.

As other people said, how could people trust icp if their previous token has been forced to be locked for 8 years ? This is an insult for justice and intelligence.

First round of ICP distribution were 0.03$ in 2017… it has been listed to 300$… went to 2800$…who has ever seen a coin listed 100.000x the price of its ICO ?

-------------------------

Mathias | 2022-10-21 08:46:13 UTC | #36

When you build something and the market perceives it to be total shit, then that is what the market perceives. There just is no magic formula. I'd prefer to see proposals about how we can do better marketing or how we can actively bring VCs into the ecosystem to fund startups. The community fund could also be a good idea (yet maybe a risky one).

-------------------------

Choiseongin | 2022-10-21 08:55:18 UTC | #37

I'll be voting no. The NNS should not be used to take control of other people's assets for our collective financial benefit.

-------------------------

dymayday | 2022-10-21 10:09:33 UTC | #41

It is tempting to solve some of our issues with this, right now. But I do think it would cause more harm in the long run.
Reputation is of utmost important in our field and so it will stain the IC forever.

I don't believe that we will find brighter days by being led by fear.
There is other ways and I'm sure we can collectively find awesome solutions !

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-10-21 10:23:26 UTC | #42

This comes across as a pretty desperate idea, made worse by the repeated justification that it comes from a "master of economics", yet the concept is to unilaterally remove future liquidity from the investment, a move singularly rejected and opposed in all regular market economics. 

Decentralization, ownership, web3 noise... all of this is, imo, about having autonomy online and having full control of your digital assets and data in a way that outdoes the regular web2/fiat system. I would also argue that, not only does this proposal not make contractual sense, but it re-emphasises a centralization and control mentality and is counter to the underlying principles of the entire movement. 

Needless to say, I will vote against.

-------------------------

cgiteach | 2022-10-21 11:00:40 UTC | #44

If you genuinely spend over 10 seconds trying to empathize with those early investors who took a risk and spent previous years building their network & reputation to be in a position of an early investor in ICP,  and came up with the conclusion that they'd react like you suggest then I personally think your judgement is questionable.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-21 14:46:06 UTC | #45

We would have eight years to decide what to do. Maybe we could lock them forever.

-------------------------

Brightcaterpillar | 2022-10-21 15:02:16 UTC | #46

It's a terrible idea. Don't mess with people's assets. They did nothing illegal that require the whole community to judge and punish them.

Use NNS wisely, not for own self gain. I will definitely vote against this.

-------------------------

Ironclad | 2022-10-21 15:19:36 UTC | #47

Maybe we could make a proposal to gather legal funds to lock you up in jail instead for trying to steal people's money, you delusional clown.

Make the proposal then.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-21 15:37:03 UTC | #49

There’s palpable anger here. Why so upset? It’s simply a proposal, and it appears that “no” will be the victor here. Are you angry that retail investors want price action to reverse? Or are you just upset that you’re scheduled to unlock in a few months and this could interfere with your dumping millions of ICP into the market?

Regardless, we all know this won’t pass; retail investors simply don’t have the voting power of the “old money” seed investors.

-------------------------

emiss | 2022-10-21 16:08:30 UTC | #51

This is a sarcastic post and a sarcastic proposal if you guys still haven't noticed. 

What he is trying to prove is whoever thought of unlocking all seeds neurons at once is a moron. If they could try to do that why can't he suggest locking all up for 8 years .

ICDevs.org is rejecting proposal 87478(locking seed neurons) for a number of reasons, most specifically that it violates the principle of non-coercion. We'd be more than happy to consider new incentive-based reasons to encourage these neurons to #8yeargang.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-21 23:29:16 UTC | #55

Hi @smaug  I voted YES on your Known Neuron proposal @smaug [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/87633](https://t.co/cz3HD3sD5W) but I voted NO on this proposal #87478. 

I support more good faith debates in ICP, even when I disagree. Thank you, Smaug for taking the time to share your ideas in good faith. 

To be honest, the main reason I voted against THIS proposal is because I am very much a "*dont do big things in complex systems*" kind of guy. You could argue i am risk averse in tokenomics. 

The idea of either *locking* OR *unlocking* any large amount of neurons changes the rules so much for my taste, that I would like to see some data or experiment to make sure it does more good than harm. I can come up with lots of stories where its good for the ecosystem and equally i can create stories where its bad, so I rejected this because "too rich for my blood."

But I appreciate the good faith arguments. So i voted for your known neuron proposal.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-22 00:05:20 UTC | #56

-------------------------

ohsalmeron | 2022-10-22 00:21:22 UTC | #57

I support the idea of reestablishing a good relationship with seed investors, for common sense, we want their ICP not only to stay, but to put that to work and be productive for the ecosystem.

I also believe in Collective Intelligence and that we can bring back investors trust with a reasonable plan and strategy for the IC to thrive, all we need for now is to move a side our personal interests and agendas for a greater good, after all we are all in this together.

-------------------------

Brightcaterpillar | 2022-10-22 05:46:55 UTC | #58

I will agree with this. Its the right step instead of proposals like immediate dissolve or locked for 8 years kinda changes.

However this would likely be dfinity's role as I doubt anyone can just reach out to seed investors or even knowing who they are.

-------------------------

Berg | 2022-10-22 05:58:22 UTC | #59

Why don't we lock absolutely everyone for 8 years?

Also, make #8yeargang the only lock option for new NNS stakers, a-la CRV where it's 4 years.

I'm half joking, but reward structure currently is too disproportionate between staking 6 months and 8 years.

Choiseongin | 2022-10-22 10:16:23 UTC | #62

The main purpose of ecosystem participation is the pursuit of profit
Whatever the reason, it markedly killed the will of seed rounders to participate.
With 150x gains already, there will be little motivation.
Also, for developers, such an environment is considered harsh
Whose sacrifice are you asking for?
enoki must have thought the same
this is really important!
No angry by a simple price drop

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-10-24 01:50:35 UTC | #63

I think that any decision to penalize an investor after the fruit of that investment has begun to benefit others, is a terrible decision. They took a risk in supporting DFINITY before the IC existed, so I have no desire to limit or change their reward for that risk.

-------------------------

thirdparty1 | 2022-10-24 08:05:38 UTC | #64

everything must be determined by expression of free will. If you artificially lock up early investors' neurons because prices fall, you can set a bad precedent for those who invest thereafter. And if you're going to dump it, it's better to dump it in a bear market like this. Forced lockdown will only exacerbate inflation resulting from compensation in the long run.
If the proposal passed and the price continues to fall, even though the seed investor's neurons were forced to be locked for eight years, would you then force the general investor's neurons to be locked?
I think it's better to study how the public can move on to web3 than artificial measures.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-24 17:16:50 UTC | #65

It has been rejected, all. I am glad I spawned lots of discussion with this proposal! From increasing NNS security to protecting us from hostile attacks, to increasing seed investors’ participation and exploring limits to NNS power, this has been great. Thank you all for your participation and I look forward to further constructive engagement with the community.
