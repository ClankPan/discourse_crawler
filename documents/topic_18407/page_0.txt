Hi everyone,
While in most cases when we talk about digital identities it's about KYC, etc., we are trying to introduce a new concept of a *digital personality*.

We consider a digital personality as a set of values, traits, interests that represents our uniqueness in terms of personal values. Potentially it has many applications - from dating/friending and social networking - to HR applications when you need to hire a person that resonates with your team's values etc.

Here i've made a more detailed description of the project: https://allkindsdao.notion.site/Allkinds-is-Web3-DAO-social-protocol-with-meta-profiles-of-values-55f9bbeebbce4208a6bf345fde05f783

At this stage there are more questions than answers, but I'd like to know your opinion on this - as builders and end users - do you see value in this? Would you consider to use it in products you are building?

Any opinion is welcome!
