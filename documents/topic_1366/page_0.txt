Hi. I’d like to set the expectations here. This repo is very early (compared to say the agent repo). There will be numerous breaking changes over the course of the next few months. 

Canisters built with a version of it should be fairly stable on a replica (because the system API doesn’t change much). But I can’t say how much we will refactor and reshape the repo between 0.1 and 0.2. I don’t know. Between token support, support for stable memory in rust, better storage api and import/export of canisters, there might be a lot of redesign. 

But in the meantime, hack away. We’ve built some really cool stuff with it and the examples in the repo will always be up to date!
