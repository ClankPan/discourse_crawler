hello!

Could the IC or the NNS enable a feature that allows for batch withdrawal of Bitcoin? For instance, could there be an option to delay Bitcoin withdrawal by an hour or a day, allowing for the bundling of transactions from multiple users who wish to withdraw on the same day, potentially reducing the withdrawal fee on the Bitcoin network?

Isn't it sufficient to handle batching at the application level?
For example, the ckBTC minter caches [retrieval requests](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/85f0c217841990a31fafa674c36691bbc7df31b0/rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/state/audit.rs#L14), which makes it possible to handle multiple requests within a single Bitcoin transaction.

Is there a reason why this approach wouldn't work for your use case?
