Is the IC Dashboard deployed as a canister on the NNS? Are the sources available for it? Thanks in advance

The IC Data Dashboard is not completely open-sourced and not controlled by the NNS at the moment. 

Some of the [APIs](https://ic-api.internetcomputer.org/api/v3/swagger) are available though.

Will the [new dashboard](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/integrating-nicp-to-the-dashboard/33614/12?u=samer) be open source?

Long thread about open sourcing dashboard [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-source-the-ic-api-that-powers-the-internet-computer-dashboard/16910/37)

The ICP Dashboard redesign will focus primarily on the front end, while the open-source requests you've mentioned are more about the back end. Therefore, the redesign and open source are separate matters.

However, if we do end up building any new features on chain as part of this redesign, we aim to make those open source.

For those interested in the availability of more verifiable data, I recommend checking out Diegoâ€™s [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-source-the-ic-api-that-powers-the-internet-computer-dashboard/16910/36?u=dylan) from earlier this year. He discussed the current thinking of R&D leadership at DFINITY and mentioned that "we are **currently working on providing more data about the IC operation that then anyone can use**."
