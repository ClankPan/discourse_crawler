## Summary

[NCC Group](https://research.nccgroup.com/category/public-report/) is a world-class cybersecurity consulting firm which has done security audits for organizations ranging from blockchain projects to Whatsapp. In March 2022, DFINITY engaged NCC Group to conduct a security and cryptography review of a threshold ECDSA implementation, which follows a novel approach described in the reference paper entitled “Design and analysis of a distributed ECDSA signing service” and available on the IACR ePrint archive at [https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/506](https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feprint.iacr.org%2F2022%2F506&data=05%7C01%7CJennifer.Fernick%40nccgroup.com%7Cc4297073350a44c3e84e08da4ecaa7ed%7Ca41111be486b45f68bd0ee01a62f368e%7C0%7C0%7C637908929721462880%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xJs6Pwxmx8EVaW4ZyBxEYE4uw46R4UCb0uYxRb65Plw%3D&reserved=0). 

Notably, Threshold ECDSA is critical in the Bitcoin < > ICP integration project.
