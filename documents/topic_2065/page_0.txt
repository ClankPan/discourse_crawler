We are miners and have some self-built IDC computer rooms and machines. We want to participate in this project. Can you help answer some questions:
1) In addition to running neurons, are there other ways, such as mining, to earn ICP?
2) Can you roughly talk about the requirements of the memory server?
3) What method will be used for application storage? Will there be any incentives to be a storage service provider in the network?

Hi gingko,
There will be full documentation for datacenters coming quite soon, it’s part of the lead up to genesis so all this info will be public then for you.

-------------------------

gingko | 2021-03-02 00:33:33 UTC | #3

Thank you very much, can you tell me about the time？

-------------------------

iFollowDfinity2 | 2021-03-04 23:53:05 UTC | #4

I also would like to receive this information just as soon as is possible.  :)

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-03-05 05:48:18 UTC | #5

I would go here:

https://support.internetcomputer.org/hc/en-us

Create an account, then click "Submit a request", and for the Category select "Node Provider -> Prospective Node Providers -> Information Request", and fill out the rest of the form.

I don't know if this website is "official" yet, but it's working well, so why wait for full documentation for someone who wants to get the ball rolling now?

As an aside, I'm sure a lot of us signed up ages ago to get notified about being a node provider. That notification never came. I suppose it still could, but DFINITY is obviously not making an effort to get the community into the data center game. Understandable, since there is a high barrier to entry, but still kind if disappointing, since the perception of decentralization in the crypto community would be much higher if average Joes were running nodes in data centers around the world. From what Dom has said, there's actually a pretty good level of decentralization with the existing node providers that have signed up, but it's not currently perceived that way on Twitter, Reddit, etc.

-------------------------

iFollowDfinity2 | 2021-03-05 10:10:10 UTC | #6

Hi Dylan, I understand that Dfinity will require a " high barrier to entry" and I have filled out the request form for prospective node provider's. I only hope that Dfinity will give myself and other "ordinary Joe's" a shot at stepping up to meet the requirements. If Dfinity would make it clear as to what the requirements are it would be much appreciated. I think that the capabilities of the ordinary Joe should not be underestimated. Everyone should get an equal opportunity don't you think?

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-03-05 16:57:56 UTC | #7

Yeah, I agree. Maybe they’ll open things up for more small-scale node providers after the network launches.

-------------------------

iFollowDfinity2 | 2021-03-05 17:24:15 UTC | #8

When you say small, what does that mean?.. I'm thinking of investing £100,000 into node equipment as I know I can get them placed into data centers in my region. I'm not a tech expert in any sense,.. more businessman. I bought ICP (IOU) recently and have a great respect for Dom and his team. what they have achieved is nothing short of a miracle.

John.

-------------------------

iFollowDfinity2 | 2021-03-05 17:28:23 UTC | #9

I also have a small group of people who have also bought ICP who would also be interested in investing in running nodes.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-03-05 17:40:05 UTC | #10

I just meant smaller than the 60+ node operators that DFINITY has onboarded so far. I don't really know what they would consider small-scale.

I'll post some Twitter links that may provide more info related to this thread.

Yeah, I didn't mean that it gives you enough info to understand the whole node provider process, just that you can start to put together an understanding of how things will work if you read every answer in the Node Provider section. I want to know everything I can about this, so I find that info interesting, but it's very incomplete.

For prospective node providers, I'd encourage you to contact DFINITY using the instructions I provided above. While they aren't publicizing this, it does seem like they are receptive to inquiries.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-03-23 18:54:18 UTC | #20

My guess is that at this point, it's much easier to become a node provider by renting space in a data center that's already approved, and harder to if you want to get approval for your own data center, but I'm just guessing.

-------------------------

iFollowDfinity2 | 2021-03-23 20:56:39 UTC | #21

I think you are probably right Dylan. 
Shame, as I've been talking to CEO of a UK green energy supply company ( with an empty suitable building- 250sqMtrs), with the intention of securing some kind of partnership with them. 
I'm thinking perhaps 25 racks 14x nodes to rack.
I can't work out what minimum investment would be required for this, which is frustrating. 
To set up data room inside building with the right power/ fibre/ fire/security I can work out.  The rest,..??? 
I'm sure this information will be available to us soon,.. I appreciate that Genesis is the main focus for now. 
Still,.. for now i'll just keep on dreaming of my independent data center, dedicated to the Internet Computer.

My colleague Mark is handling that topic and he informed me that we've currently got a queue of interested parties but are always looking for more. I've DM'd you his email address, so please feel free to reach out to him directly and he'll help you with next steps!

We'll be aiming to open this process to the broader public within a few months of launch, but for now we're still handling each one on a case-by-case basis after direct inquiry.

Sorry for the late response on the topic and for not having much concrete info to share, but thank you for staying active in the thread. This isn't my area of expertise (app engineer, not ops) but I'm also interested in the topic and happy to track down more info to share.

Wait what? I thought ICP is a permissionless protocol, even for node prividers, is it not?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-03 07:08:09 UTC | #30

It is! Data Centers apply to the NNS to be part of the network. This application turns into a proposal that people can vote on. If people decide the data center is a good fit, the application is granted. Everyone can apply to become a data-center.

Olaf | 2021-05-07 11:32:02 UTC | #31

shan | 2021-05-07 02:02:24 UTC | #33

If data centers need to apply, and ICP stakers need to vote on whether or not to accept it (aka grant permission), how is this "permissionless"? I would think that the only pre-requisite for a data center being integrated into the IC is a technical requirement: stability/uptime, hardware, etc., which can be determined in an algorithmic trustless way, and not something that would require staker consensus.

Seeing as the majority of ICP will be controlled by Dfinity / Dfinity's investors, and thus the voting power index for Dfinity/Investors would be much higher than the average user, having a staker vote to integrate a new data center is essentially centralizing this entire process at launch.

Why does integrating a data center require a staker vote to pass?

-------------------------

onqgzgtt | 2021-05-07 03:13:54 UTC | #34

That is the definition of a permissioned protocol. I was extremely disappointed by the NNS documentation Dfinity released today. For months we have been hearing that the NNS would approve nodes **algorithmically** only to learn that it will actually be done with a token holder vote. Not only that but it's not possible to host a node anonymously, node operators must provide a legal name. I don't have a problem with permissioned or centralized systems existing (although I am now questioning whether I want to deploy my own projects on the IC), but Dfinity's marketing is proving to be extremely misleading and they should be upfront and honest about the IC being a permissioned system. There is no reason why node operators should need token holder approval. Token holder voting should be a system of last resort, it should pretty much be reserved approving changes to the protocol at most.

-------------------------

hackape | 2021-05-07 05:41:11 UTC | #35

I don’t see the point, what's the value proposition of requiring approval from stake holders to join? Can only see this would potentially open up an arena for money/politics under the name of democracy. I hope you guy has strong reasons to justify this design decision.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-07 06:39:20 UTC | #36

The tokens the foundation holds are not participating in governance afaik. 

How would you algorithmically determine wether data centers applying really are independent? How would you determine they're not AWS machines? (Asking out of curiosity, not saying you're wrong)

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 07:23:33 UTC | #37

I can help clarify some points by actually going broad: *what is the goal?*

To us, the goal is building a tamperproof system where no one player or group of players can collude to mess with the system (e.g. make 2 + 2 = 5). This includes making sure that each player can not stop or slow the system either. Part of this goal is to also have this tamperproof platform be "web speed" and scalable. We want a platform that grows with more machines (throwing more machines in most protocols do not increase scale).

In studying many cases, it became clear we had to do a few things:

1. **Provide a great experience for developers and their users** - 
- most blockchain protocols, machines "mine" and if they get lucky they get a reward. This incentivizes miners from having branches that *eventually* converge. They are analogous to "bounty hunters" who get paid by the job and can turn off their machines if a better protocol comes along... even hourly. In the IC, all infrastructure providers get paid a steady stream. Nodes do not compete with each other. All nodes have to do is behave well and NOT get removed out of the network. If there is low demand on a Saturday, the node still gets paid to be part of the subnet (so it's available for a developer). Remember, the IC is meant to have beefy, world-class professional setups, not people in a garage. The NNS detects bad or faulty ones. If a node is off a few hours per day or week or is routinely slow, the NNS will remove it. This helps maintain a great experience for the developers who now have a platform that is fast, reliable, stable. 
- Because every node gets paid by minting ICP, every node creates inflation in the network. The NNS tries to maintain a healthy balance of nodes being paid so that it has what the network needs, not too much, not too little. If it needs more nodes, it can raise rewards. 
- The IC is unbounded so it can add as many nodes as NNS approves
- Better developer experience like this will lead to a better consumer experience (better apps built)... which leads to more adoption. Remember, there are only a few thousand apps in production using blockchain as backend.... and none of them using the ENTIRE app on the blockchain.

2. **Practical vs Theoretical independence** - it is important that the nodes be independent. we found that permissionless platforms pretty much led to the following cases: a few big players ruled blockchain infrastructure. This is why transparent (not anonymous) identities are important. We don't want Jeff Bezos controlling 51% of the network. The NNS tries to maintain a healthy balance of independent parties, locations, etc...

3. **Channeling The community** - In our experience, there are 100x-1000x more community members and token holders than there are infrastructure providers. We want to empower these people to have a say in the direction and keep the infrastructure side focused on high-performance, reliability, and following the protocol. The community gets paid in rewards for their votes. This is a much much lower barrier to entry for getting rewards for being a good community member. Also remember... if the community wants to change the current rules, they can do that too. 

4. **Focusing on tamperproof** - we found quite a number of attacks that users can do in a network without an NNS or identities. 

5. **Teasing apart decentralization** - Notice we teased apart what people usually mean when they say they want decentralization. They usually mean two things:

- Their apps are living in an environment that no one can tamper with (no 2 + 2 = 5)
- There is a way for people to take part in the growth of the network (getting rewards by voting not doing puzzles)

6. **"*Does this mean I will never be able to connect my machine as infrastructure?*"** - no. We have been playing and studying some ideas where we could use lower-end machines. But we want to get a good core of data centers and professional-grade setup first.

7. **Much more energy efficient** - by having machines do the actual computation for apps, that means they can spend energy on computation that matters. This is something that played a role in designing the system as well

-------------------------

onqgzgtt | 2021-05-07 08:08:13 UTC | #38

The problem is Dfinity consistently published information saying NNS would approve data centers algorithmically and that canisters could be set as their own owner, becoming "unstoppable". Today we very suddenly learned both of these are false. Data center and node approval are decided by ICP holders and canisters can be frozen (i.e. stopped) by ICP holders. Some people want to use Binance Chain and Ripple, others want to use Ethereum and Solana based on what they consider important in a network. I don't think anyone is upset with the decisions you made, I am personally upset that we were mislead.

As to some of the specifics:

Jeff Bezos could just buy a bunch of ICP.

You need peoples legal national identities to tamperproof the system? Is your method of tamperproofing calling the police on a malicious hosts?

[quote="diegop, post:37, topic:2065"]

[/quote]

ICP holders != the community. As it stands now Dfinity, Dfinity team, and big VC firms hold almost all the ICP. It will probably be years before any coalition of others can accumulate enough ICP to vote to do something against the will of Dfinity and the big VCs and by that time the precedent of a heavily permissioned model will be set and changing it will be extremely difficult. I think it makes sense to relinquish this control slowly but let's just be realistic about what could potentially be done and in what timeline.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 08:11:15 UTC | #39

by the way... I don’t think it’s an easy answer: it’s perfectly fine to accept the risk of the “Jeff bezos” or “three mining companies control 51%.” For some protocol designs, it made sense for them. It did not for our vision of IC, that’s all

-------------------------

[quote="onqgzgtt, post:38, topic:2065"]

[/quote]

Again, let’s use practical vs theoretical.

Ethereum has 8000 full nodes.

What do you think is cheaper: buying 8000 servers and running them or buying 51% of a network? We are talking orders of magnitude. 

These are the practical trade offs to consider.

[/quote]

What is the alternative? The miners dictate how the protocol advances? (Thats not intrinsically bad... but it’s also a choice. All designs need these hard choices)

Also... it seems the docs gave you the impression that people have way less influence than they actually do in governance. I should clarify that: 

Due to the “follower” model, a cryptographer like Dan Boneh May have few ICP but have many followers who vote how he votes. This gives experts more voice.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 08:19:25 UTC | #43

1. Jeff besos is worth around 130Billion. He couldn’t buy 51% of ETH even if he wanted.

2. The ping was less about Bezos but about risk... how easy do we want to make it for people to tamper? Or take control? These are security concerns. A network that can be tampered with $1MM is less secure than a network that needs $1Billion to tamper with. Nothing is perfect.

-------------------------

onqgzgtt | 2021-05-07 08:20:04 UTC | #44

I think a token holder voting model is good, I was just saying it's not realistic to think any of these major decisions will go against the will of Dfinity any time soon and once a precedent is set it is very hard to change. I do think token holder voting should be reserved as a last resort for things that can't be done algorithmically, basically network upgrades. It's a lot harder to get people to vote to enable a permissioned model than to get them to abuse one that is already there.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 08:27:52 UTC | #45

You are right. I do think Dfinity foundation has a lot of inertia. Even without the foundations tokens, it’s reasonable that a lot of people just default to “follow” any researchers or engineers who work here. 

Our goal is to seed and make sure IC is healthy. It will be a steady progress as more people take our place. I don’t expect it right away.

However.... I do think you will be surprised how many data centers, node providers, organizations, there will be even within 1 month, or 1 quarter or 1 year.

I realize we need to prove that to you: words won’t matter, but having an IC that does not need Dfinity is the goal.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 08:27:25 UTC | #46

Fwiw... I really do appreciate your points. They helped me clarify my own thinking. You did point out some areas where I was lazy in writing or thinking.

Just want to let you know, this reads as "you think you know what you want, but you don't", which I'm not sure was your intent. I don't think many developers would choose to develop on the IC if they didn't understand what decentralization is and what the benefits are.

The main point of decentralization, not listed above, is trustlessness. The promise of "unstoppable canisters" touted by Dfinity was in line with this.. up until today, where we learned that canisters can be frozen by ICP staker vote, and that becoming a host requires a ICP staker approval, in addition to a legal public identity.

It's fine to have this permission model, a lot of cryptocurrency projects have it, but I'm sure developers would have appreciated knowing that this is the case before deciding whether or not to invest their time in the IC, and not one day before launch.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 14:35:11 UTC | #48

I think you are right. My writing does read more condescending and bull headed than I intended. That was certainly not my goal.

I guess I’m surprised by your concerns since the stuff mentioned is actually stuff we have been talking about for years: NNS being able to control everything (I think it’s even as far as 2017). The new stuff just fills out the details (types, proposal categories, etc...). That surprise may have bled needlessly. That is my fault, not yours.

*I guess it’s just a classic reminder that if you write something and someone does not get it, it’s the authors responsibility.* 

To quote from a blog post from 5 months ago:

 “ *The NNS enables the holders of ICP governance utility tokens to lock them in voting neurons, which can then be used to vote on proposals submitted to the system that can be automatically executed, and can be made to follow each other in various ways such that they vote automatically — which in some sense, represents a form of [liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy). The workings will be described more fully in forthcoming technical reveals, but needless to say, many of the proposal types that it can process relate to the management of the Internet Computer’s underlying network, such as pushing upgrades and fixes to node machines, and creating subnets to scale out capacity, and this is where the real complexity currently lies*.”

*“The main point of decentralization, not listed above, is trustlessness*“

Clearly our goal of “tamperproof” Is not enough, so It *seems* (but I could be wrong) that you are saying a very valid goal: “*I want no one to ever change my code... even if the whole community disagrees with me*,” is that right? Honest question.

If so, you wouldn’t have that promise even with Bitcoin. If 51% of Bitcoin miners wanted to zero out your account, they could.

We are just putting out in the open and directly embracing that risk and designing failsafes and ways to channel it.

There are game theoretical reasons why they would
NOT do that (arguable as network becomes more valuable, it actually becomes more secure...).

I still suspect I may not be getting your high level concern, but I’m clearly not seeing it (alas... 18 hour days leading up to genesis May have fried my brain, so I’m sure i am not paying close enough attention to your posts).

I respect you people for the great work. Dfinity is the blockchain with by far the smoothest UX I've ever seen. My dev experience is great so far. I very much would like to see it success and bring to the world some real innovation. So tired of seeing EOS, TRON and the kind over the years.

I read about NNS, I'm fine with NNS and votes, but I have issue with what can be voted on.

You see, people didn't expect that joining as a node is one of those things that needs to be voted on. It's understandable if the requirement is one needs some ICP tokens at stake to become a node. But why would we need approval on top of that?

Well, decision is made, there's no point to argue further at this time. I can only voice out my concern.

Yeah people vote but who make the proposal? And who got the resource to lobby? So far what I hear is just, "trust us, we'll make the right decision". I have no problem trusting people, I have no problem using AWS either. But man, you guys are building a blockchain, trustlessness is everything.

This model just feels wrong. Even if you guys are good will champion of the project, questions still remain. Why bring in human factor in the first place? Isn't cryptography enough? How to ensure votes won't be controlled by cartel?

Guess we can only sit and see how things play out.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-05-07 22:44:08 UTC | #51

I agree with your general attitude and you hit the nail on the head few times (we had similar observations).

After, making the network upgradeable is our way of saying: "*We know we did NOT think of everything and the IC needs to improve beyond us. Past us."*

One of the reasons we call it the Internet Computer is because the Internet was seeded by a few orgs (such as Xerox, Stanford, etc...), but it lived beyond them and upgraded past their designers intent.

[quote="hackape, post:50, topic:2065"]

[/quote]

You can also propose and vote to change that! We do not know what the future will hold. we are sure the IC will need to change and adapt and needs to be better than any of us. That is why from the get-go we decided it must be not just tamperproof and upgradeable.... a tricky balance to get right.

[quote="hackape, post:50, topic:2065"]

Anyone with a neuron. it wikll be trivial to make a proposal as per the [Genesis demo on the NNS UI](https://youtu.be/xiupEw4MfxY?t=11762).

[quote="hackape, post:50, topic:2065"]
Why bring in human factor in the first place? Isn’t cryptography enough? How to ensure votes won’t be controlled by cartel?
[/quote]

I guess what I am saying is that the human factor is ALWAYS there in consensus protocols... we are just making transparent and on-chain. How many Bitcoin mining company CEOs would it take to reset something? Cryptography guarantees that consensus rules are followed. People can collude and do bad or dumb things and still be following consensus rules. We design against two scenarios: one where few people collude behind closed doors to control... or one where protocols don't advance. We opted for transparency and upgrades to balance those risks.

**You are 100% right that as a new network the IC does not have anywhere near enough players to as we would like. And you are right to be skeptical. Hold us to it.**

i value trust, I don't value lack of trust.  I personally think this project is interesting inasmuch as it helps create distributed computing infrastructure. I don't think the blockchain part is useful or helpful at all, unless it is indispensable for the project, which I do not think it is. I think it is good if we are all known to each other.

Can't agree more. Many of us are sick of seeing EOS, TRON and these BS coins controlled by cartels. The more I read about what dfinity does, the more I feel like this coin will be headed to the same direction.

The requirements to join the network as a node should be measured and granted automatically instead of giving "numbers of people" who hold the tokens to have a full control on whos to be datacenter.

I'm pulling all my investments out and telling all my friends as well.
