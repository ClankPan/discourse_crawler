Hi everyone! As of now, we have released version `0.9.3` of our JavaScript packages, which will be the last stable version before `0.10.0`. I still have documentation to do on the changes for 0.10.0, but you can read the changelog here: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/pull/476#issue-699848105

Essentially, version `0.10.0` removes all use of the Buffer and Pipe packages, as well as the non-standard Blob. Our API's are now based on native primitives, using `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`, and `DataView`. This reduces the size of our packages and requires less configuration in Webpack and other bundlers

A beta build is ready to test at `0.10.0-beta.1`, or by installing our packages with the tag `@beta`. Thanks
