With ethereum you have access to global variables like the timestamp of each block. While it isn't completely accurate down to the second, you can rely on it to for example execute code on a specific day or in a year. Dfinity so far hasn't released any methods to access timestamps or the random beacon. Will this be added in the future and if so is there a timeline for that?

Great question Fulco, I would love to know the answer to this too.
