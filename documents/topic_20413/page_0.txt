# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires Mac/Linux/WSL2, Git and Podman on your machine.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout 5eb2810653d4c72c7afc48a0450e2ad01378dfc7
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/5eb2810653d4c72c7afc48a0450e2ad01378dfc7/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/guestos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

And we have another proposal https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122748 
that provides Wasm-native stable memory.

This is an experimental build with a performance improvement. It will be rolled out only to a few subnets in this release cycle.
