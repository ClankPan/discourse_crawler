**We are here to make the status of the BABYAROF project more transparent.**
In this content, we read how the BABYAROF project was formed and how it has become one of the most decentralized ICP blockchain assets after going through many challenges along the way...

**The BABYAROF project was created without a previous plan...**

AROF first entered the NFT market and created his first NFT collection on the ICPswap platform...
The attraction of significant capital from the sale of NFT became a reason to think, should this capital be spent? Definitely not, AROF spent the funds attracted to develop a project called BABYAROF and it was at this point that BABYAROF was born...

**BABYAROF goals in the first days**

AROF dreamed of creating a different token called AROF. To accelerate the creation of the AROF token, it created a community-driven project called BABYAROF.
The BABYAROF token had two important goals, the first goal was to pump the largest ICP chain and the second goal was to create the BABYAROF army...

During the recruitment of new users, BABYAROF distributed 10,000 NFTs with the slogan of freedom, and each of these NFTs received some tokens...

The development team of BABYAROF was archiving all data in the form of wallet addresses and the problem started from here that during token distribution, at the last moment when the community was waiting to receive the tokens, they realized that the DIP20 standard could not be implemented with the help of wallet addresses. distributed...

This was a big failure that caused the distrust of the community at the beginning, and the BABYAROF project, with the help of the GHOST team, built a token with the EXT standard in less than 24 hours and distributed it among the community...

**Defects of standard token EXT**

Unfortunately, the BABYAROF token had problems with the EXT standard, which created a new challenge for the development team every day...

A big challenge was, the EXT standard forced the development team to change the white paper, and this issue again became the reason for distrust...

The next challenge was the high cost of maintaining the canister of this token standard, which forced the development team to sell tokens...

But with all these events, the BABYAROF development team was still trying to grow the project...

**One of the events that caused pressure on the development team due to low experience...**

The development team had included rewards for trading NFTs... but sending these rewards was done manually and the development team had to archive all transactions manually... this workload with no current income is part of this. The development got tired of the activity and people left the team...

The idea was very appealing to the community, but it put a lot of pressure on the development team, which caused the development team to shrink

**Worst thing to happen to BABYAROF**

The AROF person did not have access to the web space for 21 days, the reason for this was the security issues that happened to the AROF...

The absence of the AROF person and the fear of confiscation of funds by the government caused the project to stop for 21 days...

The society thought that BABYAROF had cheated and this idea was completely selective...

But after solving the problems, the situation did not return to normal, in the absence of AROF for 21 days, the archives of NFT transactions were not completed, and it was impossible to review all transactions... This event became the reason for removing the EXT token from the trading round, this event was the reason It was so that the funds were withdrawn by the investors and the BABYAROF token was severely mistrusted.

**Complete decentralization of BABYAROF token with DIP20 standard**

AROF was a bit depressed after this incident but did not give up and improved the whole situation...
BABYAROF token with DIP20 standard and made all centralized points unreachable.
The controller was left in the black hole
He burned the cash documents and...

The BABYAROF white paper was rewritten and short tutorials were uploaded on the project website for all events, so that everyone can have the ability to review and analyze the BABYAROF situation.

**Today the BABYAROF project is at a point that needs community support, we will implement a new plan that can be highly attractive to the whole community as well as new users, we invite you to read the project and contribute to the development of the BABYAROF project alongside be us**

SNS sale is must.
The help of ic ghost team is a good idea.

Certainly, the IC GHOST team is busy today and may not have enough time to guide us, but we are eager for this action.

Another issue is that the development team has nearly 4% of the liquidity, and all BABYAROF token liquidity is either burned, or is in the hands of the community, or is in a liquidity pool that cannot be accessed, we burned all the liquidity documents and We cannot access them.

But we will accept your suggestion and ask for help from the GHOST team

You need to mint baby arof token to ICRC-1 and convert 1:1 ratio to DIP-20 token for at least 2 months.
Then the remaining DIP-20 should be burned so the official token should be the ICRC-1

-------------------------

It is impossible to destroy the liquidity of DIP20 tokens... because this asset is completely decentralized and the liquidity pool can never be reduced to zero. Therefore, if we invalidate this standard, a significant portion of ICP will always remain in the pool of this token

If we replace a new standard, we cannot transfer liquidity from the previous standard to the new one. Therefore, the DIP20 standard will always remain, but maybe there is a solution for the BABYAROF project to use nns.

There is no need to destroy the liquidity pool BABYAROF/ICP (with the liquidity nft sent to black hole.)
Instead create a new liquidity pool BABYAROF(DIP20)/BABYAROF(ICRC-1).
You can actually send the new liquidity nft to the black hole if the community decides show or burn it after a period of time.

In fact we dont want to remove babyarof from ICPSwap platform.
It will be the 1st time that an already decentralized project will become SNS approved.

BABYAROF | 2023-07-31 11:00:14 UTC | #7

Therefore, we must look for new friends who can accompany us on this path.
This is an important issue, if we can completely decentralize the project, the work pressure of the team will be reduced and we can focus more on marketing and new ideas.
