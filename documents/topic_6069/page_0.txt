I created and deployed some canisters and then wanted to start with a fresh network so I used "dfx start --clean". However now when I try to deploy the canister again I get the error in the title. Do I need to need to clean something up in the canister repo as well?

Hi @Fulco 

Try this:

1. dfx cache delete (Not sure if this works but I think past week worked for me)
2. In case dfx cache delete doesn't work stop everything and delete .dfx directory (first dir inside your project).

Hope this works for you.
