I use this [certified assets canister](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/blob/0759a2846a/src/ic-certified-assets/src/lib.rs) and then use icx-asset to upload images:
```sh
icx-asset --pem ~/.config/dfx/identity/icp/identity.pem --replica https://ic0.app sync lxvgu-hiaaa-aaaag-qagaa-cai .
```
I found that if the image is smaller than 1900000 bytes, it will be uploaded in its entirety and accessed normally:

[https://lxvgu-hiaaa-aaaag-qagaa-cai.ic0.app/music.jpeg](https://lxvgu-hiaaa-aaaag-qagaa-cai.ic0.app/music.jpeg)

and if the image is larger than 1900000 bytes, it will be split into pieces and uploaded. But it cannot be accessed normally. I suspect that there is a problem with the assembly.

Here is a similar phenomenon:

Canisters are not yet able to certify chunks, and boundary nodes and the service-worker do not check chunk certificates, respectively.
There is topic about same problem
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-node-http-response-headers/10747?u=3cl1p5e7

I even prepared a draft solution for this problem, but it has not been reviewed yet

Let's hope that dfinity-team will pay attention to this problem

So is there any good solutions? 
my requirement is
* Ability to deploy a single image of around 2.5 MB into the IC canister
* Can be accessed through xxx.ic0.app/xxx.png.

Many thanks.
