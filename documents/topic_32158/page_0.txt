On the surface, the Dfinity Forum appears to be a place where everyone can freely express their opinions. However, this freedom is quickly curtailed when the so-called "internal opinion police" spot an "unpleasant" post. Such posts are promptly deleted, and the authors are either immediately blocked or placed under strict observation and moderation.

For those unfamiliar with the moderation process, it means that every post from a monitored user is pre-screened by moderators. These posts are only published if deemed acceptable. This process fundamentally undermines the principle of free expression.

The chilling effect of this policy is evident. Many users, fearful of censorship or reprisal, have chosen to leave the Dfinity Forum altogether. The platform, which should ideally encourage open dialogue and diverse perspectives, instead cultivates an environment of fear and self-censorship. Users are constantly second-guessing themselves, wary of attracting the attention of moderators.

The promise of free expression is only as strong as a platform's willingness to tolerate dissent and differing viewpoints. Unfortunately, the reality on the Dfinity Forum falls woefully short of this ideal. Heavy-handed moderation stifles genuine discourse and drives away those seeking a truly open forum. Consequently, the forum is rapidly becoming a place where only conforming and uncontroversial voices remain, while others are silenced or driven away.

So, the next time someone boasts about the freedom of expression on the Dfinity Forum, remember the invisible constraints imposed by the internal opinion police. 

True freedom cannot exist under the shadow of constant surveillance and the threat of censorship. This is the stark reality of the Dfinity Forumâ€™s so-called "free expression."
