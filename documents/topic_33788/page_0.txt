## **DooCoins**

DooCoins is a reward system for kids that motivates and teaches them important financial literacy and organization skills. Kids set goals, earn DooCoins, and redeem them for fun rewards.

## **Web3 advantages**

DooCoins introduces kids to Web3 concepts such as wallets, financial concepts and organizational skills. Basically on the backend DooCoins is a ledger.

Data ownership is an important consideration when dealing with kids data, so using ICP decentralised infrastructure is a no-brainer! 

## **How is it built**

There are 3 canisters, one backend written in Motoko, and 2 frontends, one for the kids app and one for the parents app. The frontend uses React and the apps are installable as PWA's (progressive web apps). NFID is used for Auth. It was chosen as it provides the option to login via Google, which is familiar with non-web3 users. I didn't want to put web2 users off using the app.

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

The ICP Hub Portugal have offered to help with marketing and growth

## **Monetization**

The app will be monetized through DooCoin tokens, where token ownership grants access to premium features and unlimited transactions.

## **Status of the project**

The app currently has around 100 early adopters, once feedback has been collected and acted upon we can grow the userbase
