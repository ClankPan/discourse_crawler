Hi, I'm working with a project aiming to provide multiple chain airdrop token/NFT tools.
The flow is like this

1. Airdrop creator create a vault, deposit asset into there.
2. User go to the interface then claim by their wallet.
3. The vault will send asset if the user is valid

The POC working well with ICP assets. But I concern about can I do it in another chain with canister. I know that canister now can have ability to hold other chain asset.

Have a look at our docs: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/overview

Most of your questions should be answered there

Give [NFID Vaults](https://nfidvaults.com) a try!

Our intention was exactly this and we currently have this functionality:
- Multi-sig support
- ICRC-1 token support
- Developer docs

But we ran into some challenges that we're right now working on fixing:
- There are no wallet standards, making it hard to connect other wallets without those standards
- After wallet standards, we'll add support for all standard-conformed wallets
- After supporting all wallets, we'll add support for all NFTs

:smile: cool, but do I need to wait for other chain integration?
