Hi!
I Have an object, lets say {id: 1, name: ''} this object can be null in javascript
I tried to use optional in  motoko, I faced the problem when I send object I got error
The side in motoko I tried

  public type ItemOption = {
    id: Int;
    name: Nat;    
  };

public type Item= {
option: ?ItemOption;
}

Hi!
Thanks for asking. It looks like that I have an issue when I send a object to motoko type from 
javascript when it is declared as optional in Motoko.

When I have the motoko object as nullable, I did as below:
 
// Motoko when I send null from javascript, it works, but not when I send an object for example
   {the_item: {number: 1, count: 1n  }} ...
The error says "Invalid record..."
  
public type ItemOption = {
    number: Int;
    count: Nat;    
  };
  
  public type TheParentItem = {
    ...
	the_item: ?ItemOption;
  };
  
 Here is the function which is called from javascript frontend
  func createItem(item: TheParentItem )... {}

-------------------------
