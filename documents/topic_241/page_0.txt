did anyone manage to find out how to use the above mentioned new sub command?from the description it seems like this is a language server but i can‚Äôt wrap my head around how to actually use it with vscode for example.

at first i thought if the command is  running and you modify the code it‚Äôll show you errors and so on, i also tried typing code in it like an interpreter. no success either :( 

i would appreciate if someone could point me to the right direction.

thanks!

I personally run `dfx ide`

Then I press "ENTER"

And I get this
```
dp$ dfx ide

The Motoko Language Server returned an error:

there has just been a new release that states that there is a topic in the documentation for the now called `dfx _language-service` command!

didn‚Äôt really help me though, did anyone make it work? @hansl can you give me a hint? i guess i would need to write a VSCode extension for example? the docs out there show how to write a LS extension, but i don‚Äôt get how to make it work with binaries üßê is there a simple way to invoke this with VSCode?

There's nothing more to say currently. This is an experimental feature
