Last week the [maturity modulation](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Maturity_modulation) was released. As a consequence,  the UX is updated today to more clearly represent maturity. Here’s an outline of the UX changes.

### NNS front-end app

Maturity is now shown in absolute values instead of % of staked ICP, as the conversion of maturity to ICP is uncertain.

Example for a neuron with 140 staked ICP

* Before: Maturity 10%
* Now: Maturity 14.00

![|624x399](upload://8YkKrL3xcdyBeeqjpNnov4M27DM.jpeg)

### Dashboard

On the [Governance page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) and the [Neuron page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/28), voting rewards are now displayed as maturity (the unit ICP is dropped).

![|624x168](upload://z919ehLHpHEQLLKNWcKbc7iQqPF.png)![|622x303](upload://7ZUtCuKOZNYENfNktdQoMgbYUIg.png)

On the [Circulation page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation), the Total Rewards chart has been split into three charts, taking into account the difference between ICP and maturity.

![|620x326](upload://mIz0mTpWYLT2tiflXJjSSqAnJqk.png)

On the Governance page, a Maturity Modulation chart has been added to show current and historical maturity modulation.

For ease of understanding, add a unit of maturity measurement and it will be easier to perceive
14 ICP😉

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-29 04:54:20 UTC | #4

I was going to post the same suggestion, but then I realized that leaving off the units was probably intentional.  Maturity has not been minted, so technically it’s not ICP.  It’s more like an IOU.

I've been staking since last year, but this update doesn't look good. It is difficult to see the daily rate of return if the existing percentage mark is removed and displayed only in quantity.
I think the percentage mark looks the same as before, and when the user clicks on the MERGE or SPAWN and moves the slider, It is better to show the number of ICP coins that can be obtained according to the slider adjustment ratio in real time.

Hi @thirdparty, at the moment when you spawn the amount of ICP is still uncertain due to the maturity modulation function. Hence we could only display a range of resulting ICP.

Bjoernek, that not true, fooling people with this new updates doesn't make any sense, is just a distraction from something else bad you're fellas doing as the 'decentralized' governance finally started to pickup now, when people starting to understand how it works. And apparently you, the top governing neurons by size, owned by the founders don't like that 'wake up call' and now starting to come with tricky changes proposals that would retain that power over governance in your hands. 
  Why fooling? you're going to ask... because the staking rewards dropped almost 50% in 2weeks since you've made that stupid, aka updated, changes and whatever they're meant to do, if they cut the rewards in half or more over time, WE DON'T NEED THEM! 
  When trumping from the tribune about all these amazing acomplishments, don't forget that ICP fell 99% from the ATH's and by any economic definitions, that's a failed business, bankrupt scam, call it what you want, and now those stuck with their ICP locked for 4-8years, and are 75-90% underwater with their initial investment, and can only HOPE that this POS is gonna turn around. To keep people motivated, you should REWARD the ICP holders with as much % as possible, and move all ICP's [out of TOTAL SUPPLY] in circulation, having such a big unrelesed nr of ICP's (an amount, that, to my unpleasant surprize, is still growing.. don't know why and how) is making me suspecting that majority of it will go to the top holders, which is not us, the 'little guy'. It'll be divded between the founders, the seed investors and those big whales neurons holders -  just like FED did with +$9Trln of new money printed, that very little got to people, and most of it been stolen by the government, while everyone now is paying double on everything, compared to 2years ago because of inflation. The TOTAL ICP SUPPLY has to get released, so people know that's it - we have a finite supply now, and you also should increase the burn speed of ICP, that will bring a deflationary effect on the price so we can recover from our losses.  Most need at least the price of ICP to get to the $100-200 price range over the next 3-4years, in order to recover their losses. I'm sure most retail stakeholders would agree with me, but for now, please bring the rewards back and don't invent all sort of schemes to screw up the 'little guy', if it's not broken - don't try to fix it!

We dont have a finite supply. If no one uses the ICP, it will tend to infinity. The likelyhood of that happening (no one using ICP) is next to zero.

Yes; how are we all contributing to the burn speed of icp in a consistent manner?

A couple questions:
- I was under the impression staked maturity would be displayed as a separate value, so a neuron would have ICP stake and staked maturity contributing to its VP, but now it seems staked maturity is merged with the ICP stake. Does that mean if I were to stake 100 ICP for 6 months and shortly after dissolve the neuron due to unforeseen circumstance the original, 100 ICP would go through price modulation too? Or do only tokens originated from maturity go through modulation?

- Are there any plans to allow moving non staked maturity between neurons? Some of us have many neurons with different dissolve delays and weekly/monthly merge maturity from low timeframe neurons to ones with long delays, this isn't possible anymore without being affected by modulation, which makes the merge less effective during market downturns. The only workaround I can think of involves spawning a neuron and merging it, but this action isn't available to ledger users and based on past experience probably won't be possible for months.

Staked maturity has not been implemented yet. When it is, it will be displayed as a separate value from staked ICP.

-------------------------

Jamietier | 2022-08-04 18:41:57 UTC | #14

I have ~1,182ICP staked, my neuron ID is 17121611114046667910. 

I received zero maturity yesterday and the day before yesterday (even though I voted on quite a few proposals) and received 0.0056ICP as a maturity today. I have not changed my dissolve delay or topped up my neuron recently, so don’t believe this to be causing the issue. 

My friend who has around 700 ICP staked for the same amount of time (>1year, non-dissolving) received his usual ~0.4ICP. 
 
Could anyone provide any insight as to why my rewards are 100x less than usual? I understand that reward payouts have recently changed, but I don’t believe that warrants this huge drop in rewards.

@Jamietier, according to your [neuron voting history](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/17121611114046667910?vh-s=100), there are dozens of recent proposals that your neuron has not voted on. Looking at about the past week, your neuron didn't vote on any of the proposals listed below, which could explain why your rewards are low. How do you have your neuron following set up?

Hi there

Thanks for the quick response. That’s really weird; I don’t have any followees and so therefore do solely manual voting, but I check the NNS every hour(ish) and vote on anything new - not sure how these haven’t been voted on...

Excluding that, I know that I voted on at least 8 proposals in the last two days, which should have produced more than 0.0056ICP as a maturity with a stake of over 1000 (if historical reward payouts are a good comparison, in light of the recent payout changes). 

Do you have any recommendations on followees to maximise my voting rewards? I essentially have unlimited time to vote on proposals, so manual voting is no issue for me (if this is the answer to maximising votes). 

Again, I am slightly confused as to how these proposals were either: missed by me and not voted on, or my votes were not actually registered (most likely to be an issue with my terrible internet, admittedly)

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-04 21:58:38 UTC | #17

If you give it 4 days you will get your full voting rewards as long as you have Followee(s) configured for All Topics Except Governance as well as Governance.  Ballots and eligible voting power for each neuron is established the moment a proposal is submitted, so your neuron is not eligible to vote on proposals that were submitted before being staked.  If you have a neuron older than 4 days and then add a high amount of ICP stake, you still won’t get as much reward as you think you should get until the 4 days have passed because your new voting power hasn’t been applied to the existing open ballots.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-04 22:01:15 UTC | #18

You don’t earn more voting rewards by voting manually, so that’s not a requirement to maximize voting rewards.

Exchange Rate proposals are submitted automatically and voted automatically every 10 minutes.  It’s probably not practical to vote on everything manually.

-------------------------

Jamietier | 2022-08-04 22:01:15 UTC | #19

I’m aware of the effect that topping up a neuron has, but recently have only added 30ICP to my stake (on the 31st July).

Who would you suggest to follow for both topics; does it actually matter or is it just a case of following anyone? Apologies for the host of questions, I’ve only been staking on the NNS for just over a month, and so am still learning.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-04 22:32:58 UTC | #20

The public neurons in the NNS dApp that are known to actively vote independently on Governance proposals include DFINITY, ICDevs, and ICP Maximalist Network.  Almost everyone, including public neurons, follow DFINITY for All Topics Except Governance.

[/quote]

As @wpb alluded to, proposals are rewarded 4+ days after they are created, so proposals that you voted on within the past couple of days likely haven't been rewarded yet.

I'm guessing that for whatever reason you just missed a bunch of proposals when voting manually. Setting up following is a good idea. I would follow the DFINITY Foundation on *All Topics Except Governance*, and one of the other listed neurons for *Governance*, such as ICP Maximalist Network or ICDevs.org.

random question @Jamietier ... did you merge any neurons into this neuron? No reason why it should be affected. But i heard someone say that they merged neurons and it affected their voting histpry + maturity. I wanted to see if this was your case or someone else or if its just miscommunication/misunderstanding (trying to get more data and investigate).

Thanks!

Zane | 2022-08-04 22:57:38 UTC | #23

Any update or timeline regarding the second question? 

I noticed ledger team started working again on the app after a couple months, but judging by past experience it might take months before its ready and available in Ledger Live. 

For a proposal that was supposed to incentivize merging maturity, it had the opposite effect for me so far.

-------------------------

Jamietier | 2022-08-05 11:55:54 UTC | #24

No I haven’t merged any neurons into it (other than the maturity). 

Will go ahead with the followees and report back on the amount of maturity I accumulate. Thanks for everyone’s help.

A question, now we changed from % to the actual amount earned. But it doesn't show the little earned amounts. For example neuron recieves 0.08 icp earned daily. 
But everything behind the 8 does not appear. For example 0.084848. 

For compounding this quite sucks, i don't see how much extra i get from compounding (merging). Or i really need to take a calculator with me and type the whole amount into the calculator before i start merge and re-calculate afterworths. 

I hope you get my point, a change in this for the mergers/compounders would be nice in my opnion.

Hi, maybe a stupid question, but I believe the calculation of ICP is still in percent. I monitor the maturity every. month and have a nearly equal increase, but this month it looks like the maturity is in percent and not ICP ?

Has anyone else made this observation or I’m completely wrong?

Do you mean when you click inside a neuron in the  NNS frontend dapp you still get a %? That would be odd to me. I see a scalar for maturity.

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-08-12 06:21:16 UTC | #31

No there is no % sign, but in my own calculation of the ICP reward the ICP value is too low. It seems to me that the displayed value is in percent and not in ICPs, because of the amount. But maybe my calculation are wrong.

Hello Dear team, 

I trust you are well. 

I have a few  questions. 

My staking rewards suddenly dropped almost 50 percent ever since the recent representation of maturity change took place. 

 1. Why is this happening? I would like a simple answer (not a tech guy) yet informative. 
 2. Is it temporary? I am just concerned because ever since I began staking, the staking rewards rate keep changing. It would be great to fix this so we, investors, can have piece of mind. Many of us invested for the long term (8 years) so these changes are really hurting. 

Thanks in advance for your quick response. :)

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-08-12 23:57:23 UTC | #34

I think there is a valid question here (but potentially not right dev forum thread) @gabobox @rbole 

1. Many people experienced drop in rewards recently. This includes me and almost everyone I know.

2. The main culprit is NOT the modulation (or UX around it) but the fact that governance proposals no longer get a 20x boost rewards. They now get 1x like all other types of proposals. An over-simplification: some people used to get “extra rewards” relatively speaking… but no longer do. 

 This post explains why without techno mumbo jumbo: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/rewards-fell-50/14727/6?u=diegop

3. That being said, even with changes… your rewards may still be lower than they should be. This varies from neuron to neuron.  I recommend you read this and compare this to your neurons to see if your neuron is getting the maximum rewards it should be getting:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/rewards-fell-50/14727/17?u=diegop

If you stil get lower rewards than you should, please ping us so we can investigate further!

Does this make sense? Is it helpful?

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-08-13 07:40:32 UTC | #36

Thanks also from my site, that makes things clearer. To wrap up, that I understand it clearly:

If I have a daily rewards (maturity) around 0.31 then it I should receive in a month (30*0.31)  9,3 ICP on rewards, if I vote on all possible daily votes, right?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-08-13 15:54:30 UTC | #37

[/quote]

Literally 95% Correct-ish. 

Your rewards would **hover around** 9.3 ICP, but this is where maturity modulation does kick in. When you actually disburse, it could be as low as 95% or as high as 105% of 9.3 ICP. That part is hard to predict until your spawned neuron actually disburses. 

Does that make sense? You have all inspired me to write a Wiki page on this based on these questions. So I’m very grateful.

(Given my role, I should be “that guy” and point out to readers that the number “30” used in the post above depends on the days in a month 🤓. Fórmula quoted would not work in February)

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-08-14 07:48:39 UTC | #38

Hi, thanks again for those infos.

Sure my formula will work only for months with 30 days. All of these sounds clear and I understand this, but in my case I have a neuron with a daily reward of 0.31 ICPs according to the ICP dashboard.

Maybe I’m completely wrong, but give me a minute to explain my staking strategy.

My strategy is to create every month a new neuron with the rewards of a month and reinvest those ICPs in the original neuron, so the original neuron can grow. I do it like this: split a new neuron, disburse it and increase the original neuron with the received ICPs.

That would mean on the 15th of a month I should have around 15*0.31 = 4,65 ICPs on rewards In my case the NNS app shows a value of 0,85. And this figure looks more than a percent value than a value in ICP, because if you use this number as a percentage and calc the rewards then the result is nearly the same +-.

Thanks again for helping me to understand this metric.

Clarifying question before i answer the rest: This looks a lot like “merging maturity.” If you have neuron A, You can actually merge the maturity from neuron A into itself. Is there a reason why you prefer to spawn and merge, instead? Or am i missing some nuance?

I want to make sure I follow your intent.

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-08-14 18:15:25 UTC | #40

No there is no real reason, I started with this procedure and didn’t changed it. Maybe to merge the new neuron into the “main” neuron is a better approach because of the 7 days waiting period.

I should be open and direct and admit that because of (what I and my accountants) see as the ambiguity of Tax laws in the US and California (where I live), I do not merge maturity (yet), but want to see how IRS treats ICP and maturity in 2022. “Wait and see” is my personal approach, but i know others in Dfinity do merge maturity. I just want you to be aware of options.

I usually do a version of what you originally suggested:

1. Spawn maturity into neuron 
2. Disburse new neuron
3. Sell a % of it to pay taxes (and deposit into an account for annual taxes)
4. Use the remaining ICP to create a neuron I merge into big one

I do this because I am very tax-conservative and want to make sure I always have the money on hand in case IRS takes the most conservative approach to what maturity and ICP is. This varies from country to country or state or personal comfort level as well as personal situation. So I want to be transparent what I usually do (with caveats).

LPT: I always rather pay a bit extra taxes and sleep well at night 😴 🤓

-------------------------

rbole | 2022-08-15 17:03:07 UTC | #42

I see, the tax question regarding staking income is different in any country of the world.

In my country e.g., staking income must be valued at an acquisition cost of 0 and is taxed at 27.5% on disposal, no tax on inflow.

But let me come back to my initial question. 

If I have neuron with a daily maturity von e.g. 0.31 according the ICP Dashboard. After 15 days in a month the displayed maturity must be 15 * 0.31 = 4.65 instead of 0.91 ?

Yes. That logic makes sense to me

Ok, the problem is that this particular neuron shows an amount of 0.96 per today the 16th day of the month and that  brings me back to my question two days ago? 

What I’m missing here ?

@rbole, here are a couple of things to check:

1. Make sure you have your neuron following set up correctly. Is your neuron following neurons that vote on all proposals for both `Governance` and `All Topics Except Governance`?
2. Check to see if your neuron has voted on all recent proposals. For all proposal topics except Exchange Rate, you can do this for the 100 most recent proposals by comparing the Voting History table on the IC dashboard page for your neuron with the Proposals table on the [Governance page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance?s=100). Is the Voting History table missing any proposals (other than recent ones that haven't yet been voted on)? It's a bit tedious to do this, but if your neuron is not voting on everything you should be able to see that by making this comparison.

If your neuron is voting on all proposals, you should be getting slightly higher rewards than what is shown for Estimated Rewards: Daily Rewards (Maturity) on the IC dashboard page for your neuron, which you said is 0.31 maturity per day. The reason for slightly higher rewards than the estimate is that some voting power does not vote (poorly configured neurons), and thus gives their rewards to neurons that do vote, which gives a small boost above the estimate.

@rbole everything @Dylan said is correct. 

If you do this but you still see something off, you can DM me and we can help investigate further to see if we can see anything not obvious.

I have been receiving maturity for more than year but 1 week ago it suddenly stoped. Should i make any changes ?

Hi Team,
Just wanting to ask:

 i) once the original staked time has passed... if i don't do anything, will the maturity continue to increase?
ii) if i choose to merge the maturity, example @ 100%, will the maturity continue to increase? or do i need to increase delay for the maturity to increase?
iii) if i choose to increase say for example for 188 days (minimum for vote) will that be counted from today or from the original stake date?

Thanks for you time,

What surprise  me  is it need some days countdown after start spawn.
