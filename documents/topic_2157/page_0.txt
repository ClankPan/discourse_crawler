Imagine i'm the CTO of a large global bank, and i find the Internet Computer being a compelling platform to build and strategically base most of my future internal and external business services on. Will there be a way to run my own corporate net to get started quickly within the rules of existing regulations and governance that are all tailored to how currently existing infrastructure and services are delivered and leveraged?

Yes, you can run a private network of replicas, though the documentation for this isnâ€™t out yet. You also have the option of having your private network connect out to the global network.
