Afte a day of building an app and watching it work for a few rounds, this error message popped up the next day. I am logged on to my username on ubuntu with the right permissions, but I am perpelexed why I am getting an error 0s 13. Does nayone have any idea on how to fix this dfx deploy?

Sounds like your folder/file permissions got screwed up somehow. Something with `chown -R` in the project root could probably fix it, but I'm too inexperienced to give you a full command
