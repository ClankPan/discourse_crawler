I realized there is no Rust library for converting ICP tokens into cycles. The normal way would be to use DFX. In a situation where, for example, you want to deploy canisters for your users programmatically, you need cycles for those canisters, and having a way to mint them programmatically would be useful. I tried looking into how DFX does it and came up with this, https://github.com/amschel99/mint_cycles. Let me know what ya'll think.
