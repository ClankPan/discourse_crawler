is there any particular reason why DFINITY is choosing to go backwards or is this a bug which is not letting me see **only** the details of community fund?


Tagging relevant parties from DFINITY

@diegop @lara @Kyle_Langham @chepreghy 


Hello?


Edit2: We also don’t have a dashboard details on Neuron Fund (DFN changed name of Community Fund) and how many SNS tokens are owned by the NF. GUI not CLI (you know, because DFINITY designs “everything” related to the network)


Edit 3:

Why is Wenzel spamming the thread thats asking valid questions? why are you against the community being educated? Do you not want the community to see how many tokens are there in CF?

***Anyone against this discussion clearly don’t want the community to be educated about the inner workings of the SNS***

***Since wenzel has decided to spam this thread, flag everything and derail the discussion, we will come back to this thread again in 12 hours.***

Since DFINITY has decided to lock the thread.

I will create a new thread about the topic. With same contents. Hopefully we can have a civilized discussion like educated people.



Zach DS is changing the name of the topic. If anyone has attention to spare pls give it to zach, he seems desperately holding a grudge towards ivan.

@dfinity why did you obscure Community Fund details on SNS launchpad and dashboard?.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-06 19:10:03 UTC | #7

I’m also curious as this is not only relevant but required for my Due Diligence, but also, for the defined SNS criteria provided by DFINITY.

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-09-06 19:11:37 UTC | #8

Didn't the dashboard initially show the Community Fund Details? Why are they obscuring it now?

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-06 19:37:57 UTC | #10

Agreed about information regarding the community fund contribution missing in the SNS launchpad, it does seem like a sketchy move from DFINITY's side.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-09-06 19:50:56 UTC | #11

Specifically what NF details did you see in the past that you are not seeing now?

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-09-06 19:53:48 UTC | #12

Kyle, EVERYTHING. You guys have obscured how much Funds are flowing from CF to SNS (not Neuron Fund - Because rebranding won't change its purpose)


Why did DFINITY remove it? Didnt SNS show how much CF was being used earlier? Where can I check the history of Launchpad Updates and All the UI changes that have been performed by DFINITY for NNS? Public blockchain, developed by secretive private company is it?

-------------------------

Why did DFINITY remove it?
[/quote]

They didn't have to, information on the CF contribution was always obscured in the SNS launchpad page by including it in the **Current Overall Commitment** section.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-09-06 22:47:28 UTC | #14

NF maturity can be found here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/

Amount requested from NF for each project is in each project's NNS proposal.

Individual SNS stats can be found in their project's page. 
For example OpenChat: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/3e3x2-xyaaa-aaaaq-aaalq-cai)

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-06 23:18:52 UTC | #15

That doesn't change the fact that the CF allocated for each project is obscured in the SNS launchpad project page and there's no reason to hide the number besides making it harder for newer NNS users to do proper due diligence.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-07 00:02:20 UTC | #16

How hard is it to find the proposal and view the details there? If you can't spend the 30 seconds to do that then you were never interested in doing proper DD anyway. This whole thread is the epitome of making a mountain out of a molehill. Get over it.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-07 00:22:16 UTC | #17

Way to miss the point entirely, not everyone is an experienced IC user like you or me.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-07 00:37:45 UTC | #18

If you know enough to create an II, transfer funds to your NNS wallet, and engage in an SNS sale then you know enough to find the proposal with the information you need for your DD. There's no new user who can do all that but can't figure out how to pull up a proposal. Quicker access to information is great, of course, but the change is not a big deal like the OP is making it out to be.

I'm not sure if he has some kind of anti-Dfinity agenda and is attempting to imply some nefarious conspiracy on their part. It certainly seems that way given the neurotic quintuple post at the beginning of the thread. If so then this is perhaps the dumbest possible thing to latch on to in an attempt to persuade people to believe the conspiracy. No reasonable person would make the gigantic leap from one tiny UI change to a conspiracy to defraud or confuse users. Considering this community is full of tech nerds who generally place a high importance on logic and reason, it's pointless.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-07 01:04:51 UTC | #19

Actually transferring  some ICP from a CEX and creating an II requires very little knowledge noawadays,  it's not 2021 anymore where using a YubiKey was a must.

There's simply no good reason to obscure the CF contribution in the SNS launchpad except for nefarious motives.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2023-09-07 01:19:26 UTC | #20

No good reason? It MUST absolutely be a nefarious plot to undermine the userbase and confuse new users? Because I can think of a few perfectly innocent reasons, and one well-intentioned but perhaps not well-executed reason off the top of my head. 

What if it was an oversight? Some old version of the page accidentally got rolled in to the latest update, or someone deleted that part of the code and didn't notice because it's such a trivial detail, and they were focused on more important things. Perhaps someone thought it was TOO confusing for new users and wanted to simplify the information available by only showing the total contribution. Maybe there's some legal reason that Dfinity wanted to avoid.

The point is, I have no idea what the reason is and neither do you or anyone else except the portion of the Dfinity team that works on the NNS. And they haven't answered yet. Frankly, I'm sick of opening up a thread looking for useful information only to find the goon squad has rolled in with their conspiracy theories and nitpicky, ill-intentioned complaints. I wouldn't be surprised if the team is as well, thus actively addressing these topics is given a very low priority.

+1 (plus characters since I deleted a bunch of other text)

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-09-07 03:59:19 UTC | #27

As far as I remember, initially SNS launchpad used to show the amount. Note that @Kyle_Langham still hasn’t provided details on the history of UI changes since DFINITY is the only sole UI dev of NNS front end.

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-09-07 04:11:14 UTC | #32

can you answer why DFINITY removed CF details from dashboard and NNS launchpad? Everything else you’re saying is noise.

Man you need to go touch grass right now. Get a life or maybe at least a hobby !  There is a limit to everything and you just passed it. Spamming the forum is what children do. 
With that said, new users are confused enough with the Launch Pad from the NNS as is right now.  Every project lists a link to their website and there you can find all the info you need in order to support them or not. 
Instead maybe try and educate new users  of the platform on how easy Dfinity makes to opt in and out of the Neuron's Fund and about exposing Maturity. If you don't want to support any SNS project fine let the rest of people decide.

I usually refrain from commenting on such threads because they often seem more like trolling than constructive discussions to me, no offense.

However, the claim mentioned above bothered me enough to respond. I'd like to clarify that all the changes and details are already public!

- NNS dapp is open source and can be found here: 👉 [https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp)
- Additionally, all and any changes go through the proposal process, and you can review them here: 👉 [https://nns.ic0.app/proposals/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai](https://nns.ic0.app/proposals/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai)

So, you've got the details, feel free to dig into it.

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-09-07 07:26:28 UTC | #41

So why did DFINITY remove CF details on SNS launchpad @peterparker this doesn’t seem like a straightforward question?


Branding us as trolls doesn’t address valid questions being asked. Also we’re asking specifically about SNS launchpad UI.

@peterparker from DFINITY

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-09-07 09:14:34 UTC | #45

My main point [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/why-did-dfinity-obscure-community-fund-details-on-sns-launchpad-and-ica-dashboard/22567/40?u=peterparker) was that all the relevant details are already accessible through the links I've shared. As for the rest, as mentioned earlier, I avoid participating in threads which I personally find unproductive like this one, so I won't be contributing further.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-09-07 21:23:54 UTC | #47

Not sure how you vote or if you vote at all, but as David said everything was public. I always check any changes to the NNS and build it locally and vote accordingly or state my concern regarding something while it is not decided yet. If you don't like something and want to change it just make a proposal to change it to the way you want it and wait to be reviewed and voted on.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-09-07 21:22:05 UTC | #49

Ok then, please wait for official answer on why, am sure someone will provide it in the end. Doesn't help speed it up if you just repeat it over and over.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-07 09:56:30 UTC | #50

@peterparker I've already acknowledged that DFINITY didn't remove the CF contribution in the SNS launchpad as it was obscured from the start. Regardless of @Ivan spamming in the thread, it doesn't change the fact that obscuring such important info in the SNS launchpad page of each project is a bad look for DFINITY.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-09-08 09:28:40 UTC | #52

This message is probably only interesting to @ivan, so I’ll hide the original in an edit.  It’s a strategy that seems to work for the Goon Squad.  In fact, someone should flag this as off topic, since it is.  That will also hide it except for a simple button push for the curious that think it might add a new perspective to the conversation.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-09-07 10:18:09 UTC | #53

@wpb How about you stop trying to censor people because you don't agree with them? Resorting to ad hominem attacks like "goon squad" is worse than spamming threads because DFINITY refuses to answer valid questions.

**Why did dfinity obscure details of community fund on SNS dashboard and NNS launchpad?**

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-09-07 21:22:23 UTC | #79

Maybe it’s time to close this thread.  @ivan can’t keep the conversation focused on his own topic.  He keeps wanting to talk about off topic issues and wants to do it with 5000 posts.

**MODERATOR'S NOTE:**

Over the last 18 hours, the amount of vitriol, user-generated flags has been astronomical. Come on, folks we can do better than this.

1. I am locking this thread
2. I am removing many, many flagged comments.

I should note:

1. Yes, I saw when I was personally tagged, and Lara and I did not really understand the question... nor did we find the way of asking respectful, nor do we work on the dashboard so we passed it at folks who would know more. 

2. Posts or forums that go into attacks or FUD within a day or less of posting is never a good sign the conversation is going in a healthy way.

3. It has come to my attention that folks have been trying to edit the title of the forum post in order to insult others (I am not kidding). If this continues, I will remove this thread entirely.
