Hello community,

We hope you all enjoyed the Genesis launch event!

With the Mercury Beta Mainnet launch approaching, we want to provide you with important information about what to expect in the coming days and weeks.

First, the Sodium network will be decommissioned **later today**. When Sodium is decommissioned, you will not be able to access any canisters that were previously deployed on Sodium.

Beta Mainnet will go live with over 100 nodes and multiple application (app) subnets, and will be quickly ramping up to 1,000+ nodes. Capacity will continue to grow via proposals to the Network Nervous System (NNS). Immediately following Genesis, subnet capacity will be limited to systems canisters and applications that are approved via proposals to the NNS. In the coming weeks, additional app subnets will continue to be added through NNS proposals for general use by the developer community.

We also want to share that shortly after Genesis, to facilitate the growth of the Internet Computer ecosystem and onboard even more developers to the network, the DFINITY Foundation will be offering a cycles faucet in partnership with our developer partner [Fleek](https://fleek.co/). Please stay tuned for more details on this!

In the coming days, we will be releasing additional information about how you can onboard to Beta Mainnet.

Thanks everyone! :rocket::motoko_go:

Thanks for the update, @alexa.smith . Very exciting. I have chosen to mark the occasion with a sonnet.

One late September morn she came to life,
To celebration by the young and old,
For she would bring developers delight,
By giving them a place to ship their code.
Her journey would be short, so we believed,
Her winged brother quickly sped this way,
But she would find surprise in a reprieve,
And endure beyond her fifty days.
Two hundred and a score of days then passed,
And with them winter ice would melt to spring,
Before she laid her burdens down at last,
And found a final peace in death’s sweet sting.
Now as her flower wilts and sheds its petals,
Hale Sodium, the strongest of the metals.

Hello, I said here that I cannot access the previously deployed data. I want to know that the previously deployed data contains the data I need. After the subnet is restored, can I still get the data?
These data are very important, and data in several containers are required

I'm sorry this was not what you searched :smiley: 

I think the right thing is this: https://internet-computer.typeform.com/to/IWl3iClx
there you can request to provide a node ;)
