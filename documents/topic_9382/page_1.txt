Hello, can you tell me how long it will take for cketh development? Is it more than 50% complete?

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2023-05-15 18:36:58 UTC | #102

We will provide an update on ckETH / ckERC20 and the remaining parts of Ethereum-related sub-projects in a few days.

Hi there, does anybody knows something about ipv6 eth test net rpc api? I wrote a canister to obtain the gas price of sepolia test net, but I meet the tcp network error "os 101", so I'm here for some help:)

-------------------------

diegop | 2023-05-20 03:10:50 UTC | #104

Let me ask some  folks

-------------------------

cymqqqq | 2023-05-20 03:16:57 UTC | #105

thank you diegop, it's better for sepolia ipv6 testnet, because I have deployed all test contracts on sepolia network.

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2023-05-30 11:02:21 UTC | #106

You can check the IPv6-enabled providers in the list [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-integration-with-the-ethereum-network/9382/83) whether they support the Sepolia testnet.

-------------------------

JoakimEQ | 2023-06-06 10:46:54 UTC | #107

Was there an update on this?

-------------------------

pramitgaha | 2023-06-11 11:28:18 UTC | #108

I tried most of the node providers, but I'm getting errors:
```
Err="Transport(Message("The http_request resulted into error. RejectionCode: SysTransient, Error: Failed to connect: error trying to connect: dns error: failed to lookup address information: nodename nor servname provided, or not known"))"
```

I also tried `gateway.fm` I'm getting the same error.

-------------------------

cymqqqq | 2023-06-12 03:09:27 UTC | #109

Does the node provider you tried support ipv6?

-------------------------

pramitgaha | 2023-06-12 03:36:30 UTC | #110

I tried nodes from the list provider by dieter.

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2023-06-13 09:36:00 UTC | #111

Did you try only the providers listed as IPv6-capable providers? Because an IPv4-only provider is not going to work.

-------------------------

cymqqqq | 2023-06-13 10:21:14 UTC | #112

Hi dieter, does dfinity team have a roadmap(or the timeline) for the development of cketh? and the current stage?

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2023-06-13 17:44:57 UTC | #113

Hi Jack

Here's an update on Ethereum: The Foundation decided to build the ckETH and ckERC-20 ourselves. This is likely to take some time, Q4 may be a rough estimate, without giving a strong commitment. Also note that this will initially be built on the HTTP outcalls, and later move to the Phase-2 native implementation. Work on Phase 2 will pick up again later.

Hope that answers your question.

A few points to check.
If the Dfinity Foundation is creating ckETH and ckERC, does this mean that each DeFi-related product will bridge on its own and release products in the future that swap in their own ckETH and icETH?
I felt that we are very close to ETH integration, phase 1 ckETH, but do we have to wait until Q4 even if it is phase 1?

-------------------------

Ajki | 2023-06-13 23:29:57 UTC | #115

Even though I have a feeling like I read about a July release somewhere, given the complexity of the task, I understand it takes time. After its completion, I anticipate increased user adoption. 

Although BTC integration is beneficial, I haven't seen many projects take advantage of it. Solutions like ckBTC seem to be safer, faster, and cheaper for sending BTC to other wallets compared to using the Lightning Network.

-------------------------

cymqqqq | 2023-06-14 00:26:45 UTC | #116

So, maybe the implementation of HTTP outcalls and phase2-native will be released after 2024?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-06-14 00:53:26 UTC | #117

Hi Dieter,

Thanks for the update. The Q4 timeline seems a bit different than the July 2023 ETA that was in Dom’s recent presentation that was aired. Do you mind providing some more color on timeline and what the July 2023 was referring to? 

Best,
David

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2023-06-14 07:26:41 UTC | #118

Hi David

Dom was referring to the availability of the Phase 1 of the Ethereum integration. Based on this, we will build the ckETH, ckERC-20 token implementations initially, then continue work on Phase 2 and finally switch over the implementation of ckETH / ckERC-20 to the Phase-2 implementation.

For more context: ckETH / ckERC-20 is not an easy piece of software in terms of its logic. Also, it needs to be 100% bug free. We estimated that it will take until Q4 to get this implemented in production quality. Coincidentally, this is consistent with what one of our ecosystem projects thought themselves that it would take them to implement this.

Does that answer your question?

Hi @hokosugi 

Once ckETH / ckERC-20 is available, everyone can use them for the purpose of their projects. Meanwhile, everyone may, of course, using available technologies like threshold ECDSA and HTTP outcalls, roll their own integration with the Ethereum network to be to market more quickly. However, I doubt that a production-grade implementation of ck tokens for ETH / ERC-20 can be done so quickly that it would make a huge time to market difference.

To confirm, even the Phase-1-based ckETH / ckERC-20 will take until Q4, see my previous post just above for some reasoning. Just to give you an idea on the complexity:
* Support for both ETH and ERC-20 tokens.
* Support for different ERC-20 tokens.
* High-assurance implementation. Bugs can be very costly for a code base like this, just think of attackers who can either mint ck tokens and inflate supply or redeem more of the underlying than they are eligible to. This would be disastrous, so utmost care must be taken towards building a bug-free implementation.
* Optionally, a formal modelling of the core processes, e.g., using a first-order-logic based modeling language, and showing the code implements the model.
* External security audit to further increase the assurance.

Hope that answers your question!

-------------------------

JoakimEQ | 2023-06-14 12:19:31 UTC | #120

This sounds like a highly ambitious project, way more than what was done with ckBTC (which also was complex and clearly useful). Glad to see Dfinity set sights high and with high ambition. 

You mentioned earlier that the foundation will build this on their own, but I was wondering if that was something that was set in stone or open for discussions? As many here have expressed their interest in seeing ckETH and ckETC20 (!!) come live ASAP, having other teams work on parts of the whole could be beneficial.

We've (https://equilibrium.co/) started looking again at ICP now for the past month, and submitted a grant to work on a ETH LC canister implementation. Could be interesting see what comes out of that, and if it could lead into having a conversation of other work we could be doing. Not requesting any action from your part at this moment, but just painting a possible vision of the future here that could be beneficial to everyone.

cheers!

dieter.sommer | 2023-06-16 09:25:33 UTC | #121

Hi @JoakimEQ!

This is indeed ambitious, because it's a non-trivial X-chain smart contract on the IC and the Ethereum network and we need a very high assurance of correctness. Exploitable bugs in this system would be detrimental to the whole ecosystem. Also, it needs to be ensured that the system will be maintained in the long term, ideally by the same team that has implemented it originally.

Considering the criticality of this piece of software and longer-term maintenance, we found it to be the best way forward to have a team of the DFINITY Foundation implement this piece of software and take on the long-term maintenance. Ensuring that the same team can do the maintenance is important for such complex software and increases the chance of keeping it bug free. We thought that it would be rather challenging to have many (including external) contributors on the project in addition building bits and pieces of the system and getting the same high level of assurance. Also, a community team we have been discussing this with came up with similar estimations for the timeline towards having a production-grade system available.

Your LC proposal: It may be a good idea to try out the idea of the Ethereum in-canister LC for which you have finally submitted a proposal. Need to have a look at this proposal. :-)

After https://avjzx-pyaaa-aaaaj-aadmq-cai.raw.ic0.app/ICDex/ETHtest/USDTtest 's ETHtest/USDTtest
is it now possible to trade real valuable ETH/USDT and others without CKETH ?
After all, Phase 1 integration with ETH is basically completed https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-integration-with-the-ethereum-network/9382/33
Thank you very much!
Looking forward to!

@dieter.sommer any updates on Eth integration? 

I’m sure I speak for the entire community in wanting to know how things are going! 

Cheers

-------------------------

dieter.sommer | 2023-07-19 17:46:27 UTC | #124

Here is an update on the Ethereum integration: We are currently focussing on building ckETH and ckERC-20 based on Phase 1 of the Ethereum integration, i.e., building on top of HTTP outcalls to Ethereum JSON RPC API providers. Phase 2 will start only later so we focus available resources now on the chain-key tokens.
It is estimated that this effort will be complete in Q4 this year.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-07-19 20:57:30 UTC | #125

Do you need an API key to get RPC-JSON from an RPC provider? If so, I am concerned that neither Phase 1 nor Phase 2 can be done without solving the problem of the node being able to see the key. it seems that you are considering using a SEV-SNP node, but there are still issues.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-07-22 03:30:13 UTC | #126

If Ethereum integration allows EVM on IC and EVM on Ethereum to call each other and interact with each other, does this interaction not include asynchronous processing and asym, which can do general operations? Is it only possible to do heavy processing among the processing that EVM can do?

Hi @hokosugi!

Sorry for the late response, was on a long vacation.

Excellent questions!

[/quote]

The idea is to use API providers that do not require API keys as API keys both have the problem of getting exposed and introducing centralization as someone needs to register for the API keys. SEV/SNP could address the first issue to some extent, but the centralization one still remains and is harder to address.

[/quote]

Ethereum and IC contracts calling each other is only be part of the full integration (Phase 2) that is coming after the ckETH / ckERC-20 tokens. These calls, as you mention, will be asynchronous of course and you can do anything of interest, e.g., offloading heavy computation from Ethereum to the IC, as you suggest. But you can do anything you can think of, it just needs to fit the model of being asynchronous. In Ethereum, this can be modelled similarly to an oracle call: you place the request that gets executed asynchronously and some time later a response comes back asynchronously. Everything that you can model with this approach should work.
Not sure whether this answers your question as I am not fully clear to have interpreted it correctly. If not, please do not hesitate to come back for further clarification.

How are ICP tokens going to be called when transformed to erc 20?? Ck-XX as well?? For instance ck-Kineox?? 
That is kinda confusing cause you won’t know if you are on ICP or ETH chain depending on what token is native to what ecosystem. Product team should get involved on this…
This transformation is going to be part of release 1 with ckEth or release 2??

@dieter.sommer would smart contracts on ETH be able to verify IC chainkey signatures?

[quote="JaMarco, post:130, topic:9382"]

[/quote]

You can verify BLS signatures on Ethereum, so the short answer is "yes".

However, verifying such signatures has a much higher gas cost than verifying ECDSA signatures. Depending on your use case, an approach to prevent the high gas cost could be to embed an ECDSA signature in the IC response (incurring a higher delay and cost on the IC side because an ECDSA signature must be obtained).

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-10-05 07:21:14 UTC | #132

We typically call threshold ECDSA [Chain-key signatures](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/threshold-ecdsa-signing/), so not sure if @JaMarco was asking about BLS or ECDSA.

@JaMarco The general idea is that smart contracts on ETH themselves don't need to verify the signatures, but they could just check that the `msg.sender` / `tx.origin` is a certain account controlled by a canister.

[quote="JaMarco, post:130, topic:9382, full:true"]

[/quote]

As @domwoe already mentioned, this is not necessary as the threshold ECDSA signature made by an IC smart contract is the technology foundation to realize the IC -> Ethereum direction of the integration, i.e., information flowing from IC to Ethereum in a secure manner.

If there was no threshold ECDSA available, the other prominent option of integration would be to have an "IC light client" implemented on Ethereum in a smart contract. This would require that an Ethereum smart contract validate an IC BLS threshold signature of a subnet. This would not be possible (without zk technology) in a gas-efficient way as there is no BLS precompile available yet. Using zkSNARKS or the like, one could build a gas-efficient light client on Ethereum.

But, as we have t-ECDSA, we don't need Ethereum to validate IC consensus and thus we don't need Ethereum smart contracts to validate IC's signatures.

I'm a bit lost and could use some simple clarifications.

Is the plan still to have a general-purpose Ethereum JSON-RPC canister? What is the status of that canister (phase 1 I believe is what we are calling it)? Where is the best place to go for updates on it?

diegop | 2024-03-28 14:49:48 UTC | #138

Hi,

I want to be helpful.

What data are you looking to host? There already are ways to host data on ICP and there are ways to integrate with ETH. What were you thinking ?

-------------------------

Vantage | 2024-04-03 18:08:36 UTC | #139

Thanks Diego.

I am specifically interested in the full protocol-level integration enabling smart contracts on the Internet Computer to call smart contracts on Ethereum (and vice versa). When can I expect this full integration to be available please?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2024-04-03 18:14:41 UTC | #140

Hey @Vantage,

why do you need the full integration for this? You can do this today.

See e.g this example: https://github.com/domwoe/icp-eth-coprocessor

-------------------------

Vantage | 2024-04-09 06:32:59 UTC | #141

Thank you. This is super interesting. I am now looking into these options in more detail.

With these solutions available already can you help me understand the purpose of a full end to end protocol-level integration with Ethereum is? Or is this now less of a priority?

-------------------------

Hey guys! Just checking up on this one?

-------------------------

The TLDR: full protocol integration brings stronger security guarantees.

Is this something you are unwilling to provide?

-------------------------

diegop | 2024-05-05 07:04:27 UTC | #148

Sorry I missed these messages. 

There is no official ETA yet as the work is on going. So I don’t have an answer when this would be complete.
