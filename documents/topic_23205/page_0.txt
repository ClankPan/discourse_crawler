Gosh, rarely has a side project feature taken me through so many iterations, but I'm absolutely thrilled to finally launch [Juno Analytics](https://juno.build/docs/build/analytics) today! ðŸš€

It's a simple, performant, privacy-friendly web3 analytics solutionâ€”somewhat like Google Analytics but open source and built entirely on the IC.

It empowers Juno Devs to gather valuable insights while respecting user privacy.
