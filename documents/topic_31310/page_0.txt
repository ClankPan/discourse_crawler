After **Motoko Bootcamp**, this summer we are creating an entirely new path for entrepreneurs. A path for **decentralized entrepreneurs** - one that is focused on **collaborative building**. 

We have the first public call on Monday and you're all invited to join us to learn more about our innovative hackathon,  the **Open Internet Summer** ðŸ‘‰ https://event.sessions.us/motoko-bootcamp/open-internet-summer--introduction

Have a good read.

**We will fail**, and it's not even our fault.

We are doomed because todayâ€™s system is headed for collapse. The current foundations are unsustainable, and the structures built on top of it are starting to crumble. To survive, entrepreneurs will gradually, but inevitably, make concessions. These concessions will confine their business to a path that prioritizes:

- Profit over passion.
- Efficiency over creativity.
- Compliance over autonomy.

We end up compromising our values and limiting our true potential just to fit into an outdated model.

But there is an alternative, a narrow way out of this cycle. There is another path for those playing the long-term game. It's rich, efficient, fun, and simple. But be warned, once you cross to the other side, there's no going back. **The decentralized boat is a one-way ticket.**

This path is not just a different strategy within the same outdated system; itâ€™s a complete reinvention of the game itself. It's about changing the very foundations upon which our current structures are built. **I'm not talking about winning the game; I'm talking about reinventing it.**

An extraordinary movement is emerging, a group of people, ideas, and tools with the potential to transform our systems into harmonious, life-generating ones that co-evolve with the earth.

Imagine a world where:

- Communities are stronger than corporations.
- Collaboration outperforms competition.
- Open-source generates more value than proprietary systems.
- Authenticity matters more than image.
- Sustainability takes over exploitation.
- Contribution is valued more than consumption.
- Regeneration beats degeneration.

This new world isn't defined by capital, extraction, and consumption. What matters now is purpose, connection, and values.

For the first time ever, we have technology on our sideâ€”a technology powerful enough to reinvent the organizations shaping our world. A magic card that enables us to transform how we work, collaborate, and live. The only "blockchain so powerful that it can power an entire cloud" - **the Internet Computer.**

But we have a problem.

Any entrepreneur building on the Internet Computer is following the vision of those who believed they could recreate the Internetâ€™s foundationâ€”and succeeded. They left an immense task for the next generation of builders and entrepreneurs: **rebuilding society's foundation.**

No matter who you are, this task is simply too colossal for one person.

Please, don't make the mistake of thinking that the solutions belong to traditional methods of scaling up â€” raising more money, expanding your team, writing more code, or working longer hours. All these strategies have been tried and tested, they have repeatedly failed and will fail again.

The only solution is to establish a collaborative framework that paves a new path for entrepreneurship on the Internet Computer. Startups alone won't drive the change we need. To drive real change, we must embrace a different approach.

**We must build the path of the decentralized entrepreneur.**

To kick off this journey, you are invited to the inaugural **Open Internet Summer.** This one-month collaborative hackathon focuses entirely on developing synergies between projects and re-imagining business models using the Internet Computer. Our goal is to discover the secret formula for **collaborative building**, and for that experience we need you.

How do we do it? We invite the most ambitious builders who believe in this new paradigm. Without a predefined agenda, we allow the best ideas to naturally emerge and let the magic happen. Does it sound crazy? It is, just like our future will be.

To share more and explain how you can get started, I'm hosting the first public call about the Open Internet Summer.
