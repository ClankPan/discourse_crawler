Hi everyone,

Which layer aggregates notarization shares to one notarization? Which replica aggregates notarization shares to one notarization?
I am simply trying to understand it better.

[Secure Scalability: The Internet Computer’s Peer-to-Peer Layer](https://medium.com/dfinity/secure-scalability-the-internet-computers-peer-to-peer-layer-6662d451f2cc)
According to the figure, the P2P layer appears to aggregate notarization shares to one notarization.

I could not understand which replicas aggregate notarization shares to one notarization.

5.7 Notarization
Any set of n - f notarization shares on B may be aggregated together to form a notarization for B

The above may be a wrong understanding.
N.SIG_h in the figure may be a notarization that is not a notarization shares. The BLOCK NOTARIZER in the consensus layer may be aggregate notarization shares to one notarization.

Which layer aggregates notarization shares to one notarization?
Which replica aggregates notarization shares to one notarization?
