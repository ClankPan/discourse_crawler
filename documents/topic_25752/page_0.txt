The location of the received cannot be reached to the total. SDK cannot be installed. I donâ€™t know if it is a network problem.

Here is the installing process.

My first thought is that this is indeed a network problem. Does the issue persist? Can you try using a VPN (some ISPs block the connection to `githubusercontent.com`)? And do you have any extra log output? The output you show doesn't really indicate that anything went wrong

Looks like something out of our control / something with `curl`. See also [here](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/4409)

I have changed a VPN and the problem has been solved. Thank you for your reply.
