TL;DR: [Fungible tokens: payment flows](https://mmapped.blog/posts/10-payment-flows.html)

Hi everyone!

I'm happy to announce another post in the "fungible tokens" series (the continuation of [Fungible tokens 101](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/blog-post-fungible-tokens-101/14698)). As a member of the Ledger & Tokenization Working Group, I've spent an unhealthy amount of time thinking about, comparing, and implementing various payment flows, so I decided to capture my observations in a blog post. If you notice I missed something important, please let me know, and I'll update the article!

I hope you'll find it helpful!
