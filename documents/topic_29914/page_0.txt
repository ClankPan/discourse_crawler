Hi!
Maybe I missed something basic here about ICP Outcalls.
I have an api to call from my canisters, When I used Swagger to make a POST request, I got one log with POST, but when I do the same call from a canister I got multiple POST calls, does that mean in main net each validator ( if it is a correct name) do the same POST, so it ends with multiple POST requests?
That does not sound good, because in this case I must always create a middleware to check if the same POST was done before and rsponse with the saved data? Please help, 

And plus the issue I do not find any solution for  "Uncaught (in promise) Error: Call was rejected:
  Request ID: 6ebfe0....
  Reject code: 4
  Reject text: Canister http responses were different across replicas, and no consensus was reached"

At a high level, multiple replicas (or nodes) call the API within milliseconds of each other and get a response. The replicas then agree on the response and return a response to the canister if all server responses received by the replicas are the same. 

You are getting the error `Canister http responses were different across replicas, and no consensus was reached` because the response was different across the replicas calling it. 

For GET requests, you can use a transformation function to remove fields in the response that are supposed to be different when calling at different times (ex. timestamp). 

For POST requests, as in your case, it is a bit more complicated. 

Could you possibly add an [idempotency key](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-post#important-notes-on-post-requests)?

Ok, got it now ( was expecting this multiple POST call ) I will check the idemponecy key as you mentioned, thanks!
