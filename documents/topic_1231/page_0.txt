Thank you again for supporting the work that we do here at the DFINITY Foundation. I’m excited to share that we’re soft-launching [DFINITY Education on Github](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education), a new resource for Internet Computer-related educational courses and activities.

Our first two courses cover Protocol Design and Programming Languages on the Internet Computer. Each course consists of four short modules and is designed for an undergraduate computer science student's level of understanding.

We will be releasing a new course each month. Here are a few of the topics we’ll be covering in the near future:

* Data Structures
* Web Development
* Distributed Systems
* Blockchain & Cryptocurrency
* Information Security
* Open APIs & Governance

This is just the beginning, so we would love to have your feedback! If you have a moment, we encourage you (or someone within your network) to clone or fork the activities, complete an exercise, and share any feedback you might have. For those who are interested, we are holding an [informal feedback Zoom session](https://dfinity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIpfuGvqzwoE9SJmGOBaddHWQtcZISoE1N-) on Thursday, September 10, at 12 PM PT. Feel free to drop in and share your thoughts on the educational content that you’d find most helpful in furthering your project development or research.

Please note that for those of you who create educational content for other communities or blockchain-related clubs, all of the material that will appear on DFINITY Education is open source and free to mix, adapt, and use. This content also intended to seamlessly integrate with [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

We hope to see you there!

Hello @Mike_DFN!


It seems to be what I needed to really understand what the Internet Computer is about.

Thank you! :slight_smile:

Unrelated. Why are am I unable to make comments on some threads while this thread I am able to? Do I need to be approved somehow?

Thank you.

Hi Alain, you should be able to now, along with creating topics (it’s a forum setting, as per this thread here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/hello-world-from-florida-usa/260/10 ). Let us know if this is still an issue!
