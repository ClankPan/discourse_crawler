More of a Motoko person, but had the displeasure if diagnosing an issue involving a Rust canister today. It seems that a Rust panic will always return the generic "unreachable" message when compiled to WASM for the IC. What are the main issues standing in the way of supporting messages in panic error responses? Is it more of a WASM problem than an IC problem? This feels like a critical developer experience/efficiency item.
