In a `TransferSnsTreasuryFunds` payload, there is a field `to_principal`. What's that principal, is that maybe the `owner` of the account? Is that maybe a naming inconsistency?

```
type TransferSnsTreasuryFunds = record {
  from_treasury : int32;
  to_principal : opt principal; // <----- ??????
  to_subaccount : opt Subaccount;
  memo : opt nat64;
  amount_e8s : nat64;
};
```

Yes, it's the target owner principal.
