**The COE project has started its activity with the aim of creating a decentralized community-oriented economy flow in the ICP blockchain. After 7 months, the first phase of fundraising for the COE project is near.**

The COE project has been growing the community by distributing ap-coe NFTs for the past 7 months and is scheduled to run its first vote on the DAO section of the ICPswap platform in the next 48 hours.
In the white paper of the COE project, it is considered that the first phase of fundraising is done in a group called sp-coe for the purpose of advertising and providing financial resources for development.
sp stands for sponsor.

The COE has planned advertising funding so that all the money raised stays in the chain and the funders have the opportunity to make a profit in the short term.
Therefore, we considered sp-coe as a mother category and started an exciting story in the heart of this category, which creates new events in each episode.

**First DAO and pricing of ALP NFTs**

If you hold ap-coe NFTs or buy COE tokens, you can participate in voting and determine the price of ALP NFTs.
ALP is the first project started by sp-coe. ALP is in the sp-coe category but is an independent and completely decentralized project that started its own science fiction story.

ALP is completely autonomously managed by the community and has no official website. ALP will benefit its investors and supporters and also open a new avenue for COE token trading.

**What is waiting for the community after the DAO voting and the price determination of ALP NFTs?**

ALP NFTs will be sold in two stages.
All people who hold ap-coe NFTs are placed on the ALP purchase whitelist and can buy these NFTs at a 70% discount, although this opportunity is limited.
In the second stage of sales, the rest of the NFTs will be sold in the Launchpad section.

**What do we do with the attracted capital?**

ALP has a token with a maximum liquidity of 7 million, the standard of this token is ICRC-1.
2% of the liquidity of ALP tokens is placed with COE tokens in a liquidity pool on the ICPswap platform.
This happens like this:

The COE project will add 1% of the cooperation share of its tokens to the back of its trading pool. (based on trading pair BABYAROF/COE)
50% of the funds raised from the sale of the ALP collection will go from BABYAROF to COE to purchase COE tokens. (We convert 50% of the capital first to BABYAROF and then to COE) We place the purchased COE tokens with 2% of ALP tokens in a decentralized trading pool.
50% of the attracted capital remains. These ICPs are placed in a trading pool with 2% ALP token liquidity.
2% of ALP tokens are distributed among ALP NFTs.
2% of ALP tokens are distributed with the help of the COE/ALP trading pair farm.
1% of the share of ALP tokens will be airdropped among all DSCVR users, which has a promotional role.

ALP has its own independent white paper, which we suggest you read. In this program, COE ads are done correctly, no funds are withdrawn to pay for ads, and investors who supported COE and bought ALP have the opportunity to profit from the growth of the ALP token price.

Undoubtedly, this style of advertising is unprecedented!
ALP is a strange project, I think it will become one of the most exciting tokens of the ICP chain.
