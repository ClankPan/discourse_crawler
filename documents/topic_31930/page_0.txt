### **Project highlights**

Momint is an innovative asset marketplace enabling global, fractional trade of renewable energy (Solar). 

We cater to investors seeking high-yield, secure, and liquid opportunities and businesses that need solar on their roofs. 

We bridge the gap between private capital and profitable, renewable projects. Our target users include institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, and commercial property owners, such as farms, factories, and residential estates.

### **Web3 advantages**

Unlike traditional financial rails and Web2 platforms, Momint leverages blockchain technology to provide unparalleled efficiency, security, and liquidity. Our platform enables 30-second remittance, up to 650 times cheaper than traditional methods. Ownership of assets is securely managed via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and ease of transferability across 160 jurisdictions globally. This significantly reduces the legal and administrative overhead typically associated with renewable energy investments.

With ICP we will introduce fully auditable data and near-Realtime integration with smart IoT devices to enhance data on chain about the assets and their performance.

### **How it is built**

Momint is built using a robust tech stack including Motoko and Rust for blockchain interactions, and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) for the platform's backend and frontend. Smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the Gnosis, Polygon, or Ethereum blockchains - Soon ICP! 

This setup ensures flexibility, scalability, and control over our technology. We also integrate various third-party services for enhanced functionality and security.

### **Internet Computer superpowers**

The Internet Computer's unique features have been instrumental in enhancing Momint's capabilities. Its high-speed, low-cost transactions have allowed us to offer instant transactions and asset transfers. 

The scalability of ICP is important to ensure that we can handle a growing number of transactions and users without compromising on performance. 

Additionally, its secure, decentralized nature aligns perfectly with our commitment to providing a transparent and tamper-proof platform for renewable energy investments.

### **Go-To-Market strategy**

Our go-to-market strategy involves targeting larger private equity firms and fund managers through direct sales efforts, leveraging signed Letters of Intent (LOIs) worth $100 million. For the retail market, we utilize a content marketing strategy, having garnered over 2.5 million views on YouTube, and extensive PR campaigns reaching over 450 million unique readers. We also plan to engage with relevant communities through strategic partnerships and participation in industry conferences.

### **Monetization**

Momint is a for-profit venture with a clear monetization strategy. We earn a 2% fee on every transaction, a 2% fee on each payout, and a 20% performance fee. The platform's high yield and tax incentives make it an attractive investment, ensuring consistent revenue generation. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of launching a decentralized governance token (SNS) to further enhance community engagement and investment opportunities.

### **Status of the project**

We have made significant progress with Momint, having onboarded over 53,000 retail users and facilitated $5.9 million in sales on the platform. Our project pipeline includes $20 million worth of solar projects, and we have completed over 500,000+ transactions. Our platform is fully operational today, with continuous improvements and feature additions based on user feedback and market needs.

### **Future Plans**

Looking ahead, we aim to scale our assets under management tenfold within the next 24 months and explore new revenue-generating asset classes such as digital content, managed property. 

We plan to attend key industry conferences to expand our network and visibility. 

Additionally, we hope to grow further with ICP and start listing our assets with them and move our wallets over to ICP
