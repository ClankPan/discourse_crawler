As an addition to the [SNS Launch Checklist](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-launch-checklist/19855 ) previously posted here in the forum, we have prepared a simple Google Sheet with the same items and description, but created as a work sheet with fields for your notes.

As with the other checklist, this is shared as general guidance for projects planning an SNS launch, and should not be construed as the definitive list of action items that need to be taken in preparation of any such launch.

Hey @lockanna,

thanks for catching this. The up to date SNS Launch checklist is part of the documentation now: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/tokenomics/sns-checklist/
