I upgraded to 0.6.24 but it does not create a local wallet when I deploy or create canisters...
Does this work only for a new project?

I created a new project and it created a wallet for this project. 
How do I create a wallet for an existing wallet?

We've noticed some of the same issues internally. If you delete `.dfx` and then start with `dfx start --clean`, you should get your existing project up and running with the wallet.

Sorry for the inconvenience as we shift our tooling toward a genesis model!

thank you that works! Maybe update the docs to have a migration section from 0.6.23?
