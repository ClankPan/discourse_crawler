Couldn't find the answer. There is no such panic hook in `ic-cdk-rs` either.

Will `panic` revert the state? Is it correct to use `Result::expect` and other helpers which `panic`?

Did you ever get an answer on this?

Some conflicting info here.

ic_cdk::trap can explicitly propagate the error message to the client, and the state changes before trap are reverted.

You can trap by calling by `ic_cdk::api::trap(&str)`, but the state wonâ€™t rollback.

I mean the state before the last async call won't be rolled back. State changes from the last async till trap is reverted.
