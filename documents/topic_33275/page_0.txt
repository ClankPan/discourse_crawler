**Brief Intro**
Predi is a community-driven prediction market contract framework that provides a comprehensive development and application template for communities, enabling ecosystem projects to quickly customize their own prediction products. This delivers a diverse and engaging betting and prediction experience for users. As a decentralized autonomous organization, the mission of Predi DAO is to establish a fair, transparent, and efficient prediction market infrastructure, fostering the robust growth of the blockchain ecosystem.



**Background of Product Development**
Market and User Demand: With the development and popularization of blockchain technology, prediction markets have gained increasing attention from users. Prediction markets provide a platform for users to bet on and predict the outcomes of future events, thus engaging in interesting betting and prediction activities. This market is not just a financial derivatives market; it also possesses entertainment and social attributes, attracting many prediction enthusiasts and community participants. The decentralization, transparency, and fairness brought by blockchain technology have become critical market demands for prediction platforms.

Opportunities from Emerging Public Chains: As blockchain technology continues to advance and new public chain ecosystems thrive, more projects are choosing to build prediction market platforms on emerging public chains to meet market demand and explore new business models. These new public chains offer more flexible, efficient, and low-cost development environments, providing new opportunities and possibilities for the development of prediction market platforms.

Demand for Simplified Product Forms: As the number of crypto users continues to increase, the need for simplified user experiences and product forms for prediction market platforms has become more pronounced. As an emerging market, prediction market platforms need to provide simpler, more user-friendly products to attract more users and offer a richer and more diverse betting and prediction experience.



**Problems to Solve**
Lack of simple and highly interactive products in the market
Need for increased user participation in emerging public chains



**Design Principles**
Unlike traditional products, our design of Predi draws extensively from the concepts of traditional financial institutions and products, social communication strategies, DAO governance principles, and product operation approaches. We introduced the concept of "slots": the Predi contract framework is the mainboard, and ecosystem applications connect to the mainboard through "slots." The decision on whether a specific ecosystem can join the mainboard is collectively made by DAO governance. This can be understood as a license in the financial industry or a "passcard" in the crypto space. Each ecosystem application can introduce different token supports according to its operational strategy. Predi does not concern itself with specific tokensâ€”this governance authority is decided by the ecosystem application itself. This effectively provides use cases for blockchain projects with an existing user base and good operational capabilities.

A dissemination mechanism is a fundamental part of the Predi product: just as we incentivize contract interactions, all dissemination behaviors are also encouraged.

Financial Thinking: Predi's design incorporates the ideas of traditional financial institutions and products, combined with blockchain technology features, creating an innovative and forward-looking prediction market platform.
Social Communication Thinking: Predi integrates social communication strategies, incentivizing user participation in prediction market activities through a dissemination mechanism, and encouraging users to share and promote the platform, thereby fostering community building and user growth.
DAO Governance Principles: Predi's design includes the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance model, which collectively decides whether ecosystem projects can join the mainboard, ensuring fair, transparent, and efficient platform operations.
Slot Mechanism: Predi introduces the concept of "slots," with the platform's contract framework as the mainboard, and ecosystem applications connecting to the mainboard via slots. This allows for customization and rapid integration of ecosystem projects, providing more flexibility and choice for ecosystem projects.
Open Ecosystem: Predi's design aims to build an open ecosystem, fully leveraging community power, and dancing with the ecosystem to explore unlimited possibilities, offering broader development space and cooperation opportunities for ecosystem projects.

**How it Works**

For Ecosystem Projects

Purchase a Slot: Ecosystem projects need to purchase a slot as a fundamental requirement for accessing the Predi mainboard.
Customize DAPP Operation and Interface: Ecosystem projects can customize their DAPP (Decentralized Application) operation strategies and user interfaces to ensure compatibility with the Predi platform and enhance user experience.
Initiate Voting: Slot holders can initiate a vote, inviting community members to authorize the slot's connection to the Predi platform, further ensuring the project's legitimacy and credibility.
Collaboration and Support: Ecosystem projects can collaborate with the Predi platform to add their tokens to the supported list, providing users with a richer betting and prediction experience.
Launch Prediction Products: Ecosystem projects can release various betting activities and products based on their operational strategies and user demands, including simple "yes or no" judgments and multi-option selections like "A, B, C...Z," inviting users to participate.

For Regular Users

Select Ecosystem Projects: Users can choose their preferred ecosystem projects and the prediction topics or products they are interested in.
Participate in Predictions: Users can invest corresponding tokens based on their judgments and analyses to participate in prediction activities. If the prediction is correct, they have the opportunity to share the rewards in the product pool.
Retrieve Earnings: If users' predictions are correct, they can withdraw the corresponding earnings, enjoying the benefits and fun brought by the prediction activities.
Through this operational model, the Predi platform facilitates effective interaction between ecosystem projects and regular users, promoting the development and expansion of the prediction market.



**Features**

Integrated DAO Governance: The Predi platform integrates a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance module, allowing community members to collectively decide on the access of ecosystem projects, ensuring fair, transparent, and efficient platform operation.
Ecological Development: Predi fully mobilizes community strength, dancing with the ecosystem to explore unlimited possibilities. Through an open ecosystem, Predi provides broader development space and cooperation opportunities for ecosystem projects.
Extensibility: The prediction market scenarios on Predi can extend to countless fields, including but not limited to cryptocurrency prices, presidential elections, weather, technological developments, and sports events. Users can participate based on their interests, enjoying a diverse range of betting and prediction experiences.
Outstanding Incentive Model: Predi combines judgment monetization with behavioral mining, offering users generous incentive mechanisms. By participating in betting and prediction activities, users can earn rewards and benefit from the appreciation of platform tokens.
User-Friendliness: Predi's design philosophy is to create a simple, easy-to-use, and highly interactive prediction market platform, allowing ordinary users to easily participate and enjoy the fun and benefits of betting and prediction.
Technological Innovation: Predi continually explores and innovates, introducing novel design concepts and technical mechanisms such as the slot mechanism and DAO governance module, providing users with superior and reliable prediction market products and services.
