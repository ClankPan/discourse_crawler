ollowed the instructions from [here](https://dfinity-docs-preview.netlify.app/docs/rosetta-api/ledger-local-setup.html)

This is an ancient docs preview (at least 5 months outdated). How did you end up there? This shouldn't be linked anywhere. The current version of this document is here: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup
