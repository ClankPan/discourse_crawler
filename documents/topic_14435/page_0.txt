Can someone point me to a resource for the best practices in managing canisters in a team environment.

I have reviewed the canister management docs which are from an individual perspective, but I was wondering what others have found is the preferred way to handle multiple team members updating multiple deployed canisters.

Who typically deploys, how are controllers added, how are principals communicated? Is there an accepted work flow for all of this?

Good question! I'd also like to learn of approaches that people are using. 

One way I'd think of would be to handle deployments using Github Actions.

You could also have a look at a more holistic solution for managing deployments on the IC that's currently in development: https://www.icpipeline.com/

Wow that is a robust solution.

There is a lot in there, will look into ic pipeline.

thanks for sharing this!
