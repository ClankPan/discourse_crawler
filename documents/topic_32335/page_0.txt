**Hi all DFINITY forum members, Krzysztof here from [ICP Hub Poland](https://x.com/ICPHUB_PL)!**

**This is a proposal to create a Known Neuron from our Hub for Polish-speaking community members.**

ICP Hub Poland, also known as ICP HUB Poland - RUSH, is one of the Hubs with the mission to develop the local ICP ecosystem and promote its solutions among developers and community.

For the past and this year, we have created and conducted boot camps on various programming technologies, reaching thousands participants in our educational spaces. This effort has been carried out in collaboration with organizations, companies, and universities.

We are a small team who coordinates the activities of this Hub and are responsible for driving the adoption of the ecosystem in Poland.

**Selected Hub Leaders:**

[Maciej OrÅ‚owski](https://x.com/magic_orwash) (Lead Hub Manager)

[Andrzej BTC](https://x.com/Andrzej_BTC)

[Michael Lustyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-lustyk)

[Krzysztof Å»elazko](https://x.com/kc_zelazko)

*â€¦*

*and many, many other wonderful people.*

**Why create a Known Neuron?**

As one of the Hubs where English is not our primary language, we have faced numerous situations where it becomes very difficult for the community to share their talent to build this great ecosystem.

We want to be a voice for all those who are part of the Poland community and whose trust in us translates into representation so that decentralization in ecosystem decision-making also includes those Polish speakers who have been unable to participate due to the language barrier.

We believe that the NNS (Network Nervous System) demonstrates that we can have a globally participative ecosystem and that this will be an opportunity to involve Poles in ICP governance.

**What topics will we vote on?**

From the beginning, our Hub has focused on training Polish developers to be able to build with ICP technology. However, initially we will be following topics that include Governance and SNS & Neurons' Fund. We want to give the collective vote to the widest possible. Neuron will follow between 10-15 of the most recognizable and experienced members of our community. Over time, we will expand our competences in other, specific topics, about which we will inform the overall community on an ongoing basis.

Our main goal is to achieve a balance between its decentralization among the community and active neuron voting on specific and intricate technical governance topics with the help of selectively chosen and rooting experts.

**Neuron Control**

For now, the control of the ICP Hub Poland known neuron will be my (initial configuration) and Maciej OrÅ‚owski (post followees configuration), as the persons in charge of the technological and organizational part of the Hub.

We want Poland to participate actively in ICP governance and to be a bridge for those looking to drive this great ecosystem forward.

*If nothing stands in the way, we will submit the registration proposal at the end of this week* ðŸ™‚
