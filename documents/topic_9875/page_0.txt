import RemoteCanister "ic:njgly-uaaaa-aaaah-qb6pa-cai";

gives me a following error:

`cannot import canister urls without --actor-idl`

I know its possible to do it on IC network with **actor("njgly-uaaaa-aaaah-qb6pa-cai")**, but that doesn't work when deploying locally.

Your local dev environment runs its own replica which doesn’t call out to the main network, so for now the solution is to deploy a version of the remote canister (or a mock canister with matching interface) locally and interact with that using the actor(“<canister_id>”) format.

Note it’ll get assigned a different canister id, shown in the terminal output when deploying, so you’ll need to use that id locally.
