Hi 
  I received some amount of cycles by using DFINITY's [Cycles Faucet tool](https://faucet.dfinity.org/), now I am following [XTC](https://github.com/Psychedelic/dank/tree/main/xtc) documentation to convert them to XTC.  I am running a following command, but get an error. What did I miss?  Thanks

```
dfx canister --network=ic --wallet=$(dfx identity --network=ic get-wallet) call --with-cycles $(echo "$(dfx wallet --network=ic balance | cut -d' ' -f1)-10000000000" | bc) aanaa-xaaaa-aaaah-aaeiq-cai mint "(principal \"$(dfx identity get-principal)\")"
An error happened during the call: 5: IC0503: Canister aanaa-xaaaa-aaaah-aaeiq-cai trapped explicitly: Custom(No more values on the wire, the expected type nat is not opt, reserved or null)
```
