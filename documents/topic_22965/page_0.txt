Is it possible to step by step debug rust backend canister code?
How to get the similar experience like when debug java code in IntelliJ IDEA
I walk through the docs. didn't find it. Cause I want to write code style as test driven development.
So if i can  debugðŸª² with canister. will be great to find out the problem.
I find out that : 
maybe use lldb+wasmtime can work?   ðŸ˜ˆ
What if there is a good article about setup steps for debugging will be great!

If you split canister logic and the canister interface you can write unit tests that you can debug normally. Here's how we do it in the asset canister: canister [interface](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-certified-assets/src/lib.rs), canister [logic](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-certified-assets/src/state_machine.rs), (not very nice) [tests](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-certified-assets/src/tests.rs)
