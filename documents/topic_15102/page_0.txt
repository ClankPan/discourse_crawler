```
public shared func getRoleProfile(name : types.Name) : async ?types.Profile {
    role.getProfile(name);
  };
```
I am calling role.getProfile() function from my main.mo file. The function is define in role.mo file.
The defination of the function is 
```
public func getProfile(name : types.Name) : async ?types.Profile{
      profiles.get(name);
    };
```

I am getting an error in the function getRoleProfile in main.mo. The error is 
```
expression of type
  async<$getRoleProfile__14> ?Profile__764
cannot produce expected type
  ?Profile__764
``` 

What will be the return type of this function?

Since the problems you're walking through is the world `async`, basically you can't do it immediately and have to wait for a bit until it can be done. You can solve this by adding the key word `await` in front of function you need, to satisfy the structure.

You can take a look at this post for a better understanding what's the differences between `async` and `sync`.
