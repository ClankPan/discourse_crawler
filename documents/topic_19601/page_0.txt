# Announcing NNS Updates

The NNS team will be continuing to release updates on a more regular basis (as we have been doing internally over the last 6 months) with smaller incremental changes.  

We will begin posting updates in the forums before we submit the upgrade proposals to the NNS Governance canister.  

Our goal is to give developers time to raise issues before proposal submission, and extra time for the community to verify hashes and participate in governance.

We will be generally attempting to post an update by Tuesday in the forum, followed by a proposal on Friday, and then a vote by DFINITY on Monday.  

Additionally, we may post interesting news and updates from the NNS team, as well as more context about upcoming releases


# Next Releases

The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals this Friday, April 28, 2023.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## Additional Notes / Breaking Changes

TLDR: This release contains a breaking change in NNS Governance.  Update your candid definitions to the soon to be released version if you decode proposal data in candid.  

### Details

We are working on a new proposal for creating SNSes based on learning and feedback from the SNSes that were already launched.  Because of an issue with Candid, this means that any code attempting to _decode_ a [ proposal action](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/dfinity/ic/-/blob/rs/nns/governance/src/gen/ic_nns_governance.pb.v1.rs?L608) will not be able to do so.  

The solution is to upgrade your candid to include the new variant before the NNS Governance proposal is executed.

Update: We will be releasing a slightly different version of NNS from yesterday due to a potentially breaking change we would like to better assess before releasing.  We are temporarily reverting a commit (see Release Notes) that was cleaning up some unused code in Registry.
