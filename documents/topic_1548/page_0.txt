A few weeks ago I was able to deploy my canister to Sodium just fine. Now I'm getting errors.
Here's the repo: https://github.com/phase-all/phase-all
Using DFX 0.6.12.
The first error is below:
Deploying all canisters.
All canisters have already been created.
Building canisters...
Executing 'cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package controller'
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.14s

Installing code for canister controller, with canister_id x5lkf-zecaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-eaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
An error occured:
AgentError(
    TimeoutWaitingForResponse,
)

I tried deploying again after that:
Deploying all canisters.
All canisters have already been created.

I deleted canister_ids.json and tried again, still getting errors:

After deleting canister_ids.json multiple times somehow it deployed :) Here's the URL if that's helpful: https://i3sny-2eiaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-caaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q.ic0.app/
