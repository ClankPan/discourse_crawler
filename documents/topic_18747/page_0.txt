Hello. I merged two of my neurons (Both on ledger) and I no longer see the aging reward. I have had this Neuron for 1 year or so and after the merging, the aging reward is gone. I was told I had to wait 7 days or so, I did but nothing happened. I would like to hear from you guys as this situation is quite sad for me.

Hi there,

Have you tried to look at your neuron on dashboard website ?

Like https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/yourmergedneuronnumber

It does show anything there neither ?

it shows my neuron is 7 days old :(

Have you taken in account neuron value ponderation ?

Like if you merge 2 years neuron of 1 ICP with a new neuron of 100 ICP you will end up with a 4 days old neurons

Hi Kyliux, I am not following. I beg you to break that down for me.  One of my neurons was locked for 2 years (dissolving) and the other one for 8 years (not dissolving) after the merge, the new neuron was dissolving. Thanks for your help by the way.

I havent tried to merge dissolving and locked neurons.

It might be that the merge gave the status *dissolving* to the final neuron from one of the previous onces, in that case there is no age, if its the case and wasn't your intention, I would like to thank you for sharing your experience here, it means Dfinity could improve the UI to prevent this from happening. 

Anyway, I wish you all the best =)
