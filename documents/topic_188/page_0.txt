There are some great resources published online that provide context as to what Dfinity  has been trying to accomplish since inception of the project back 2014.

For those who are more familiar with the project, I would defer to the [FAQ section](https://dfinity.org/faq/) of the official website as it contains some great documentation such as [how Threshold Relay works](https://assets.ctfassets.net/ywqk17d3hsnp/2C8QU0x3q4AwuYYU4qiEmo/fb575987ca36672152a47b83ec96c0fc/dfinity-consensus.pdf) and a post on the [Dfinity Blockchain Nervous System](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-dfinity-blockchain-nervous-system-a5dd1783288e#.duzxztt9k).
