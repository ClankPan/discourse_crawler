Hi everyone,

Example: Ms. X has stored her personal information in Project A. She wants to prove to Project B that she is an adult without revealing her Principal (or equivalent ID) from Project A. Is there a method to do this on Internet Computer?

Prerequisites:
- It is assumed that vetKD and AMD SEV have been launched.

If revealing the principal from project B to project A is allowed then it's possible by having project B ask project A if it's principal has been added as 18+ principal by anyone.

Another option is having the user use project A to generate a signature for a random challenge from project B, which project A only does if the user is 18+.

Main concern here is to avoid a user generating 18+ proofs for other users. Even if the principal is shared, this can't be avoided. First thing that comes to mind is adding something like a proof of work like Internet Identity did when creating a signature for a challenge, so automating this abuse won't scale.

Also I would add expiries to the signatures so they're only valid for a limited time (so nobody can generate a whole bunch and share them over time). 

And lastly you could store every challenge signed by project A, so project B can report to project A that it's suspicious of a challenge. If enough challenges have been reported for a user of project A, actions like banning the user could be taken.

Thank you for your reply.
random challenge is a good idea!

Since only that user knows about the random challenge, there may be nothing to worry about. It might be nice if random challenge had an expiration date.
