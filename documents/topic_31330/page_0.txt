I read the following in the forum but i dont know how to "set your local network to be a system subnet"

> The [XRC ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/uf6dk-hyaaa-aaaaq-qaaaq-cai) lives on a system subnet where making outcalls is free, so itâ€™s not necessary for it to attach cycles. If you want it to work locally you have to set your local network to be a system subnet, too

You have to configure it in `networks.json`, which is located at the place where `dfx info networks-json-path` points you to. It follows the schema that you can print with `dfx schema --for networks`. My `networks.json` to use a system subnet looks like this:

```json
{
  "local": {
      "bind": "127.0.0.1:8080",
      "type": "ephemeral",
      "replica": {
        "subnet_type": "system"
      }
    }
}
```
