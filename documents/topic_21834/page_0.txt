Thanks @ZackDS, these are valid questions. Currently the dashboard doesn't display the node machine type. This item is on the backlog of the engineering teams and will be added in a future release of the dashboard. We have reviewed the Cross Information Leak vulnerability and concluded that the risk to the IC is minimal. The main attack vector - a malicious canister - cannot generate the AVX instructions required to exploit the attack. The Cranelift JIT compiler is configured to disable these instructions.
