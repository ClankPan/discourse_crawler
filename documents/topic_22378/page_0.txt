# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/64016bcd15a39bb494591f949b289d5a92128365/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 64016bcd15a39bb494591f949b289d5a92128365
```

Note that there are more changes in this release than typical. This is because we had some issues in the qualification process, so we decided to skip a release cycle.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of this replica update.

Proposal ID: **124272**
Neuron: CodeGov.org
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566167/nns-proposal-124272) 
Voting history: [Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100&vh-topic=TOPIC_REPLICA_VERSION_MANAGEMENT)

At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period.  I encourage NNS voters to review the replica update proposal and vote manually.  Of course, you always have the choice to follow another person or another organization who is voting independently.  At this time, I am aware of [CodeGov.org](https://www.codegov.org/) neuron and [Taggr Network](https://taggr.top/#/realm/NNS-GOV) neuron who are performing this work, both of which are registered known neurons.

SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:
The week we had two new developers who joined the CodeGov project and participated in the review.  I'm looking forward to seeing further participation from @massimoalbarello and @ilbert in the coming weeks.  

RECRUITING NOTE: 
The CodeGov Project is offering attractive bounty payments to experienced Rust developers who are interested in spending a few hours each week reviewing Replica Version Management proposals, which are code changes that are submitted to the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) governance system for adoption or rejection.  We do this through IC-OS Verification and by performing a sanity check on the Release Notes.  Our votes are cast according to the findings of our reviewers.  Proposals are usually submitted on a Friday and we complete our reviews within 48 hours.  Each reviewer posts a summary of their findings in the CodeGov portal on DSCVR.one and the bounty payment is made using the tipping feature of DSCVR with ckBTC equivalent to USD.  The bounty is always announced in [this bounty payment post](https://dscvr.one/post/11096526/the-current-bounty-per-person-for-reviews-ic-os-verification) on the portal and the [deliverables for each review](https://www.codegov.org/reviews/deliverables) can be found on the codegov.org website.  It is a requirement to [Apply](https://www.codegov.org/apply) on the codegov.org website and to complete either Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN in order to get paid the bounty.  Please send me a DM or an email at codegov.org@gmail.com if you would like to discuss this opportunity further.
