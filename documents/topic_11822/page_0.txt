Hi all

I'm considering using Plug wallet in my project and would like to know if it's actually possible to have some kind of a testing setup with the Plug wallet locally so that it uses locally deployed ledger canister (which would allow me to send ICP to my plug ID and populate funds that way and then "spend" them with the local ledger canister, since from what I've seen so far, it seems Plug uses the regular ledger whenever you send transactions ?

Is it possible to do and how? If not, how do you guys go around this when doing local dev for things that require transactions using locally deployed ledger canister?

Looks like they will be implementing that feature (to be able to use PLUG locally with ledger canister) in the near future and next releases. In the meantime, what do you think is the way to go, since it's impossible to use PLUG or similar wallet(s) locally while using locally deployed ledger canister?

Have you found a solution to the problem?

For local testing you have to follow two steps :

- [ Setup ICP ledger locally](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup)

- [Setup custom Test Network in Plug](https://medium.com/plugwallet/plug-0-5-3-network-selection-49e105334d83)
