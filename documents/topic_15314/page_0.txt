Name: ICP ("Official")

Introduction: ICP ("Official") is the official community owned and managed by the DFINITY Foundation, the main developer behind ICP

## Is DFINITY building a public blockchain or a consortium chain?
## Is IC a private chain of DFINITY?
## Does DFINITY have a new definition of public blockchain?

### I know DFINITY is a major contributor to IC and I also know that DFINITY holds 21% of voting power, But what right do employees from DFINITY have to represent and control an public blockchain official community  without a vote from NNS? How is this different from fraud?  Is it because the voting power we get is a pile of air?

### Maybe someone at DFINITY has no idea what a public blockchain means?  Why can someone build a public blockchain without understanding what a public blockchain is? Shouldn't this be a basic requirement to join DFINITY? ###

-------------------------

I think you meant to say that DFINITY holds 21% of total voting power instead of 21% of neurons.

I'm not sure if this helps (or is correct), however, I had similar questions at first, then I realized (or focused on) a major part of what I was overlooking. That being, DFINITY is the Non-profit that is the biggest contributor to the ICP coin. They are distinctly *different* entities though. So, the IC network was created by DFINITY and then is open to the public. However, that doesn't mean we have any say in DFINTY as an organization *only* the public blockchain they created. However, the blockchain itself is public, the code is public, and any one of us could start building and deploying projects if we had the cycles, time, energy, and sustainable resources to do so. This is what I believe the concept of a public blockchain aims to achieve. Thus, why I feel they (the DFINITY foundation) are also slowly distancing themselves from the ICP coin and IC and making it a known distinction. 

For example, right now there is around 55% staked overall correct? Then if the community (or individual buyers) do buy up the remainder of the supply they would have more of a pull to alleviate this exact issue you speak to in my opinion at least, because the objective is to have most of it staked/ purchased by the community (you and I) so that way down the road their % is only enough as they deemed necessary. However, a lot of people may not be willing to stake, or for various other reasons we haven't purchased the total supply that would give the "community" the actual voice like some of us may want *right now*. I definitely understand your frustration. I just have to keep reminding myself of this distinction personally. I hope it gives you a new perspective if anything.

The DFINITY foundation should and could be elected through NNS without any loss of organizational efficiency. In fact, this can completely solve the decentralization problem of any public blockchain with POS, as long as it has such a wonderful mechanism as NNS.
But it seems that everyone in this forum is so frightened by this idea. I don't know why.
Maybe IC is indeed a private chain.

ysyms | 2022-09-07 09:18:48 UTC | #5

This may not be realistic, most stakers do not have the expertise to select the right person, and DFINITY as a legitimate company is not under the direct management of NNS, even if NNS passes the proposal.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-09-07 09:25:09 UTC | #6

Now the owner has fixed those weird things. Glad DFINITY took quick action on this, we didn't change our goals

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-09-07 10:56:26 UTC | #7

NNS is always learning to make good collective decisions, and, obviously, the earlier the better. 
NNS does not need to select the right person. DFINITY selects a "right" person, and then NNS approves it in the final.
If DFINITY is not under the control of NNS, then NNS means nothing but a disguise.
Many people think that BTC cannot be fully decentralized because of the existence of the BTC Core, and ETH cannot be fully decentralized because of the existence of Vitalik. But if DFINITY can be under the control of NNS, then ICP can actually be fully decentralized.

It is very strange that you do not know why given that every time you bring this up people tell you why. namely that recruitment, technical interviews, HR, etc can't possibly be conducted by leaderless democratic vote, and that nobody in their right mind would work at a company where their employment status and pay depends on an annual popularity contest

you keep saying It Will Make It More Decentralized like it's a video game stat then ignoring every actual problem raised and instead just repeating it again or giving some nothing-answer about "honor". *actual* democracies such as your favorite western government do not have you elect every employee. you elect the guys who make all the decisions and then everyone under them is hired paid and fired just like any normal company. if every parliament paper-pusher was elected by national vote then there would be so much worthless churn and dysfunction that nobody would ever have the time to write some actual laws.

if you think a DAO where every token holder votes on every last aspect of the employment process is the best way to run a company then nothing but cash stops you from proving it. in the meantime everyone else will keep developing software instead

[/quote]

To be perfectly honest, I am having a lot of trouble understanding why you would say that. Clearly, the IC is NOT "a private chain." But more importantly, you @ysyms have spent many months in the IC community where there has been ample evidence to the contrary, as well as many thoughtful answers from folks to your questions (I alone have answered many of your questions).

I am honestly starting to wonder whether our efforts answering your questions were fruitful or productive. 

If you do not believe the ample technical evidence, nor the words of many of us, maybe it is better you spend your time researching another blockchain project. 

In short, at some point I will start asking for some signs of evidence that you care at all for the IC... but I honestly have seen mostly complaints, miscommunications, and odd questions. A lot of your questions (such as on this thread) are born from looking for evidence (usually from secondary marketing material, not technical docs) for a conclusion you have already reached. If you do NOT care for the IC, then do not spend your time on this. No harm no foul. There are plenty of other chains.

-------------------------

zire | 2022-09-07 15:29:33 UTC | #10

Let me be clear @ysyms , 

- I'm the owner of the ICP Discord. You know who I am. You can address my name directly. That would be a nice manner.
- I removed "Official" from ICP Discover a few seconds after having a call with @diegop . My action has nothing to do with your post on this forum, or your suggestion to me on this topic a few days ago. Yes I let you know on Telegram and said thank-you for your suggestion (I generally thank everyone who tries to give me suggestions). I didn't change the server name because of you. Just so that we're clear. You don't have to take credit for something that had nothing to do with you. A colleague showed me your post here hours later I already changed the name.
- As @diegop said, if you don't trust the people in DFINITY or the tech we are building, feel free to join other blockchain ecosystems. Nobody is forcing you to stay here. Your hanging out in IC is turning into a tortuous story that is consuming many hours for many people who could have spent their time in much more productive way or more meaningful questions.

kusiyo | 2022-09-07 23:12:59 UTC | #12

In sum: under the control of NNS, the operation of DFINITY does not change at all; it just needs an official NNS approval in the final.

You can reject anything if you want. But if you can change your mind for a while, you will see the beauty of this idea.

I was also astonished at the response. Dfinity appears completely blind to its deficiencies. I have a whole thread about issues with transparency with which nobody from the Foundation has engaged:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/transparency-within-the-dfinity-foundation/14872
They have no decentralization roadmap, no transparency roadmap, no roadmap to transition away from Dfinity's hegemonic control over the protocol. Read through Dominic Williams' 20 year roadmap and there is no mention of any of this. They seem to really believe that because 'the tech is really good' everything else can just be wished away, including the erratic behaviour of their leader. 
I have also been told to go elsewhere by a Dfinity spokesperson, but I won't. I have a fair amount staked in the protocol and I will stay and push for good changes as best I can, and so should you, @ysyms

[quote="ysyms, post:14, topic:15314"]

[/quote]

Well this is where I think you and I have a disagreement on tone, not substance.

@zire literally wrote:

> I removed “Official” from ICP Discover a few seconds after having a call with **@diegop .**

Meaning I agreed that term "official" was not right, so @zire (Herbert) changed it. No harm, no foul. I have certainly written many things which were incorrect and then corrected them.

My disagreement is on tone. If your post had said "I dont think this is the right word," I would have agreed. Instead it goes off about dfinity employees technical acumen.  I think that this feedback on your communication style and how even when I agree on removing the word, the tone was unnecessarily purist or reactionary.

Further piece of context:

While I am on the camp that the word "official" was wrong, I think it is worth understanding Herbert's intent, and more directly, his inspiration. There are a few blockchains that have "official" discords. He wanted to create a similar lightning rod for community... 

.... Now you may say, "Why can Herbert create an official discord?" and the answer is honestly the inverse of what you assume. Anyone can create a discord channel that claims to be the "official BTC" , "official Eth", "official ICP", etc... discord channel. It is a protocol. **A channel or discord server is only as official as people are willing to concede to it such status.**

The question is NOT "*why did Herbert get right to put the word official?*" ... the question is more "*Why do you think it is the official one? I certainly do not. That is why I told Herbert and he removed it*."  

In blockchain protocols, it is up to the community to emerge the channels or leaders it wants to raise. In the same way I can call myself "King of Bitcoin" and create "official BTC discord."

ysyms | 2022-09-08 16:23:15 UTC | #18

I do not want to spend much more energy on THIS thread. But I can tell you @tsetse that I certainly SAW the earlier thread, brought it to up many leaders at DFINITY, and we took it a feedback for things to work on. The only reason no one from Foundation has not replied is my fault. I told people "I got this", but have been wanting to reply with something substantive. 

In hindsight, I should have at least replied acknowledging that we are reading it actively to see where we can improve.

Not quite.

Google and Apple are companies. They have a legal right to say "this is NOT the official discord channel".

With blockchains, anyone can create such channels and it is up to the community to decide depending on traction. It does not make them scams necessarily.

But regardless...this is a perfect example of what I am referring to:

1. I cited that Herbert changed wording because I suggested it
2. You ignore that 

It would have been better if you had written, "*I am glad you also agreed and he changed it. Next time I will assume good intent when asking."* There are many faults or bugs, treat things as bug reports and less like bad intent... makes it easier to for folks to fix them.

This is what happened:

2. I did not like X 
3. You do not like X
4. X was changed

This is what a healthy feedback loop is.

It seems we are stuck in:

5. You want to discuss X 
6. I say "I also didn't like X and X was changed, so whats the point?"

in fact you have backpedaled so hard just to post that that you have reduced it to something that requires no change: if dfinity is to act as normal, but with NNS sign off on the final product, that already happens and the most recent one was [999f7cc](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/78693)

I feel that the right person or in this case organization is why we are mostly here as we believe in this project. Who is to say that most stakers or any stakers have the expertise. I personally have invested into this project and feel they, Dfinity, do have the expertise to make decisions on my behalf and I expect many will disagree but that is what I believe is democracy, as everyone has a say so those of us with less expertise understand the concerns to find a solution.

While it is useful to point out the issues as you see it, you are applying Reverse Representation by telling us that we are not capable and therefore not reasonably able when voting.

Reverse Representation means that you are in fact behaviour just like that of whom you accuse.

Good point, as pointed out by @ysyms most of us may not capable so Dfinity should have control.

> @civolian: Web3 blockchain developers are valiantly seeking the holy grail of true decentralization.
> 
> They sincerely want token holders to be meaningfully involved, but it seems nothing will motivate them to vote at the levels needed for true decentralization. The futility is disheartening, and it’s tempting to conclude that token holders will never make the effort to get educated and vote.
> 
> They’re only interested in windfalls, which means we’ll just have to accept the fact that decentralization is fundamentally limited and can only be maximized within those limits by clever incentivization mechanisms.

This is also my experience which was stated by @civolian but I point to the last line which I feel is true and disturbing, by clever incentivization mechanisms.

Dfinity has in my opinion been clear about their intention and have stated that this will also take time, discussion and voting to achieve. The pace of this change will not be achieved by accusations but with discussion but too often I see others create clever schemes to encourage those who don’t have the expertise to see Difinty as the enemy.

I feel we have the right to express our ideas, concerns and then have discussion with the community to make change.

Could you imagine a country without a single figurehead or Government, it would not be possible and in my opinion, we would then see many argue that they are and should lead, putting down their strongest opponent as the bad guy.

As pointed out here

> @[xpung](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/xpung) HR, etc can’t possibly be conducted by leaderless democratic vote, and that nobody in their right mind would work at a company where their employment status and pay depends on an annual popularity contest.

> @[diegop](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/diegop) Is IC a private chain of DFINITY?

It is in my opinion both Private and Public. As I might not have the expertise and get it wrong but this is my honest opinion.

The IC is built on a system that is different to the rest of the internet so that any existing technology built on Web2 and 3 cannot run on the IC and in my opinion a private system but public in the way you can built and replicate the current old internet onto the IC without Dfinity or anyone else's permission.

I see this as a very good reason for doing this. In my opinion the old Internet is broken and needs to be replaced and I feel the IC is where I want to be.
> 
> @[ysyms](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/ysyms) DFINITY. Ha ha
> 
> this values are going to reshape the Internet, is it to return to feudal society?

Yes, history will always repeat itself and even the internet community will tell you that most projects have a 30 year lifespan, so one day the IC may be replaced. 

We are already seeing a feudal society within the IC community with your own clever incentivization mechanisms and why I agree with you.

> @[tsetse](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/tsetse) They have no decentralization roadmap, no transparency roadmap, no roadmap to transition away from Dfinity’s hegemonic control over the protocol.


I would think that Dfinity has many unanswered questions about what they are building and maybe they are flying by the seat of their pants and I am sure that many here personally may feel they do know the answer, that they should pose their concerns as questions for discussion and not declare themselves as having the right answer.

Dfinity as I understand it has some of the best qualified people in their team to build the IC and move forward with many of these unanswered questions, I think we will have to wait for these answers from those better qualified than me. There is no guarantee that the IC will succeed at all.

Please be a healthier person @ysyms as anger does not help you and forgive us who are less experienced and I am sure you can point out problems as you see it for our gain as a better community and your relentless attack of @diegop is not really fair or acceptable.

I think it's kind of funny that we're having this heated discussion on forum.dfinity.org, a centrally hosted web2 forum that the Dfinity foundation provides.

The IC is more than just Dfinity, and I agree with removing the "Official" branding from the new Discord. I personally have been very involved with supporting the community-run developer Discord, which ironically still is called "Dfinity Dev Official", even though it is not run by Dfinity at all.

I think there are two fairly uncontroversial takeaways from this thread, which seems to have mostly run its course.

1. The IC ought to move to more decentralized organization and discussion over time
2. Dfinity still currently plays in important role in fostering discussion today, and should both take concrete steps to reduce that dependency, as well as the perception of that dependency in our comms + messaging

In sum: under the control of NNS, the operation of DFINITY does not change at all; it just needs an official NNS approval in the final.

Why do I repeat it here? Because it can answer all of your questions. You just do not listen carefully.

I will repeat it again and again, until someone can find its logical flaws. I really hope that someone can change my mind.

Of course, DFINITY does not need to be under the control of NNS, because it is possible that IC (including NNS) is indeed under the control of DFINITY.

I love NNS so much. If DFINITY can be under the control of NNS, then it will make ICP fully decentralized and may eventually rule the whole digital world.

I thus believe that IC will be the Metaverse. But I hope that this Metaverse will be under the control of NNS, not under the control of DFINITY.

Before you object, you can change your mind for about five minutes. That's all I need.

wpb | 2022-09-09 02:37:26 UTC | #40

I didn't intend to get involved in this one, but since you tagged me I'll provide my $0.02.

I think a project like the internet computer requires that it start off centralized in a lot of ways, but can, and is, evolving toward a decentralized state.  This evolution will take many years or even decades, which I think is the right pace.  I think there have been many communications from DFINITY that decentralization is a goal and many examples of how they have helped push the community in that direction.  I want DFINITY to continue doing what they think is in the long term best interest of the IC.  I have no issue with the creation of the new ICP Discord server by DFINITY.  By the way, thanks for sharing the link as I hadn't seen it yet ;-)

This topic seems reasonable as a forum discussion, but it was escalated to an NNS proposal ([79944](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/79944)) by @ysyms today.  It is not possible for a response from @zire, @diegop, or anyone at DFINITY to occur through the NNS, which in my opinion makes it an inappropriate form of communication.  I believe the NNS should be used to make governance decisions for the internet computer instead of announcement spam.  I had hoped we moved beyond all forms of spam, but admittedly advertisement spam is still a risk.  Hence, I have started deliberation on a [new proposal topic](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-mitigate-nns-advertisement-spam-a-temporary-solution/15360) to mitigate advertisement spam until a long term solution can be implemented.  Feel free to join the discussion.

I agree, I really am for people sharing their thoughts and opinions. However, personally, I feel the NNS proposal was a bit *too* far. I feel the discussion should have ended here. You may be running the risk of becoming a "bad actor" in the space. I would take a few days off and re-adjust after this proposal is rejected.

 From my understanding, @ysyms is challenging what you guys said before
>"If you do not believe the ample technical evidence, nor the words of many of us, maybe it is better you spend your time researching another blockchain project." 
from @diegop 

>"As @diegop said, if you don’t trust the people in DFINITY or the tech we are building, feel free to join other blockchain ecosystems. "  
from @zire 

The sentence is not friendly for the person who made the suggestion even the suggestion is quite reasonable. act as Dfinity officials, you should be more inclusive of everyone instead of hearing criticism and saying, you don't like it here, you can leave. From my perspective, it's not right manner to handle this.

Dfinity should be open-minded to criticism, @ysyms  is an 8-year staker, just because of his loves ICP, he wants IC to do better in decentralization. A democratic voice should be allowed here, even if his wording is drastic.

But unfortunately, your inappropriate response that led to proposal 79944 occurred.

I think we should make lessons learn here.

The sentence is not friendly for the person who made the suggestion even the suggestion is quite reasonable
[/quote]

I can certainly appreciate why it may appear that way. I frankly welcome critcism. I protect it in this forum and subreddit. 

And maybe I’m just *personally* tired of replying and engaging with Ysyms’s comments because I ONLY hear criticisms (valid and invalid) and no acknowledgment of the “time spent engaging with his questions” or “when things complained about are fixed” (making me question how important the problem was in the first place… or if the problem was an opportunity to be a criticize). **It’s possible this tiredness has clouded my judgment. I cannot rule that out.**

To be perfectly, honest… I do not think the posts by ysyms were reasonable given the wider context of his past history of posts. The suggestion to remove “official” from a Discord server is in of itself reasonable and indeed I had independently told @zire and he had independently removed it. But ysysms posts went beyond that(as they usually do). Indeed, even though the initial complaint from ysyms was resolved (the word “official” was removed), there only followed and odd series of replies from him such as:

[quote="ysyms, post:21, topic:15314"]
So DFINITY is guiding the community to recognize DFINITY as the official official of the ICP blockchain
[/quote]

For example here is from the initial post:

[quote="ysyms, post:1, topic:15314"]
Maybe someone at DFINITY has no idea what a public blockchain means? Why can someone build a public blockchain without understanding what a public blockchain is? Shouldn’t this be a basic requirement to join DFINITY?
[/quote]

This is close to a *borderline* ad hominem attack. Imagine if I were to tell Google search engine team “don’t you guys know what a search engine is? Should this be a basic requirement for joining Google Search?” It would of course be seen not as criticism of search but as direct questioning of the team’s skills. 

That being said, I still engaged and try to answer the original question ysyms posted in good faith.

In this thread, when there was ONE positive opportunity he had for replying with constructive criticism, I pointed it out to him so we can take action… and no response and of yet.

[quote="diegop, post:30, topic:15314"]
Now THAT is useful feedback. I was under the impression it was. Can you point out where it was not? That would help a bunch.

If You think I am being too harsh @MillionMiles, definitely let me know. This is how I can improve.

Glad to see your quick response!

Yes, I agree with you that @ysyms words were somewhat inappropriate. maybe because translation issue or culture different. 

but anyway,  I guess he want to emphasize that a sense of decentralization should be ingrained in all of Dfinity's official external activities.  the discord name of ICP(Official) is an unimaginable mistake from his understanding, so his wording starts to get emotional when you tell him to leave.

I want to express my thought:
If Dfinity only care about technology, not concerned about decentralization, then the powerful google, Microsoft, Amazon will be able to defeat IC.

That's what my concerns.

**A major contributor is the best definition of Dfinity, but definitely not ICP(Official)**

@diegop Sometimes people's demands are unreasonable, sometimes their maturity level is low.

You've been consistently patient and humble from every exchange I've seen. Please don't change.

I agree, this or (@diegop) is what has helped me feel more comfortable in the space as well.

More transparency and decentralized is needed, otherwise SEC would say ICP is a stock of Dfinity.
But the employees entitlement don’t need the NNS approval, it’s a issue of Dfinity internal. Every action Dfinity takes on ICP chain will be governed by NNS, that’s enough and adequate.

I went onto the discord site and had a look around.

As I see it the discord is a website that is built by theDfinity team and if they had not declared this and made it clear to everyone which in my opinion would have result in a distrust and does not warrant any approval from Neuron holders of ICP or needs to be voted on by the NNS.

The IC, if this project is built on, is available to everyone on a public network that needs no permission to be built on.

I actually use the company to connect to my coin account and upload my transactions for the financial year to determine my tax which worked very well.

Accointing by Discord

The site in my opinion is a classic presentation for advertising the IC and getting anyone and everyone interested in the Public IC - P.

Even the discord name changed to "ICP", i don't think it's a appropriate discord name. I think "Dfinity(Official)" is the best. 

Look at the example, Japanese community to use ICP's official Discord Japanese channel as official community.
![WX20220911-134737@2x|614x500](upload://rdzUqofyL1T6Pa1Zn6obBSlo9nq.jpeg)


If this Discord is the official ICP community, the consequence is that maybe more and more community within the ecology will gradually be established based on the ICP official Discord, which is a bad signal of centralization. 
 
This is my opinion, looking forward to see any response.

Million, I created the `ICP` Discord server. It's a server run by the DFINITY team with strong support from many community leaders who help us moderate different language channels. We welcome all ICP members to join this Discord as this is where we often hang out as well, fielding questions from the community. If a community member wants to create another ICP XXX channel, by all means please go ahead. Nobody is saying you must join which server. The choice is always with the community. The only asset DFINITY team members can control is our own time, and we'd like to spend that time on a server where we know where to reach out to the maximum ICP community members possible in the most efficient and effective manner.

Million, 

You're firing at the wrong target. 

When @ysyms started creating spam posts on NNS a few months ago, I organized a Twitter Spaces event and invited pretty much all the lead KOLs in the Chinese IC community (and @diegop joined as well briefly just to lend his support) to have an open discussion on ysyms ' feedback and suggestions. https://twitter.com/herbertyang/status/1511262522220851200 . It was a very spirited discussion that went on for 200 minutes, yes 200 minutes. Everybody chimed in and many shared their support or at least appreciation for the spirit of ysyms' act. @PaulLiu gave an excellent lecture on how governance works on IC. ysyms spoke for less than 10 sentences all in all, despite multiple times where I tried to give him the mic. 

Before you name-call DFINITY members for not being open-minded to criticism, maybe it would be helpful to brush up some history in the community.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2022-10-21 11:01:54 UTC | #58

OK, understand, no problem, we should move forward to other more import topics. :smiley:

Kvic,

Please read the welcome message upon first-time login into the ICP Discord, or just go to channel `_guide`. 

> Introduction to ICP community, Part I
Hi fam, welcome to the ICP Discord community hosted by the DFINITY team!

I think we made it pretty clear who created this Discord server.

cryptoisgood | 2022-10-21 11:54:58 UTC | #60

Omg this is so petty

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-20 21:15:52 UTC | #61

Maybe ICA. DFinity is an independent entity that is making a contribution, and holders have no right over how it is structured or led.
