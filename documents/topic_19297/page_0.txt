**TLDR**

There is no industry standard for defining circulating supply (CS) and coins can vary drastically on their definition due to particularities of the specific coin. At the time of Mainnet launch, DFINITY chose a complicated and conservative definition for circulating supply, and we are now evaluating how to simplify that definition and align closer to the behaviors of major L1 chains. We submit to the community that a reasonable definition of CS for ICP, which both simplifies the definition and aligns with industry practices, is to define circulating supply as total supply minus liquid tokens owned by the DFINITY Foundation.

**No Standard Circulating Supply Definition**

Definitions for Circulating Supply vary drastically across the industry and are necessarily vague due to the differences between each coin and project. Take a look at this definition for circulating supply:

“The best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public’s hands.” - [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/circulating-supply)

These types of definitions are commonplace among almost every single trusted crypto source. Oftentimes, one source’s definition directly contradicts another source’s definition, for example, the definition found on [21 Shares](https://21shares.com/research/understanding-circulating-supply-the-xrp-case-study) removes staked tokens out of circulating supply, whereas almost every other definition includes staked tokens in the circulating supply based on some conditions.

The net result is that there is no consensus within the industry on what constitutes circulating supply and each coin more or less determines its own definition, usually with consideration to the expectations of crypto participants like CMC. In most cases, it appears coins typically consider their foundation’s coins to be considered non-circulating, however even that basic standard is only loosely followed.

**What Other Coins Are Doing**

It’s challenging to find a definition for circulating supply for most coins (for the record - ICP’s current circulating supply definition can be found [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Total_supply,_circulating_supply,_and_staked_ICP#Definitions)). In a lot of cases, we are left having to guess how the coin defined its circulating supply based on the percentage of total minted supply

that is considered circulating. In almost every case, a coin’s circulating supply is at least 70% of total mint and in many cases (such as Cardano, TRON, Aptos and Algorand) the percentage is greater than 96% (which begs the question, how are these coin’s foundations funding themselves?). For comparison, ICP’s current percentage of circulating supply is 59%.

![|279x350](upload://60ghztEBir0RK8pVzWz0fGEK1ed.png)

It seems that universally there is a desire to categorize as much of a coin’s supply as circulating for two reasons:

1. To increase the coin’s market cap and therefore coin ranking on sites like CoinMarketCap.
2. To decrease the appearance of dilution risk.

A good rule of thumb for any crypto project seems to be: maximize your circulating supply.

**How is ICP Circulating Supply Currently Calculated?**

If you clicked the link above on how to calculate the circulating supply for ICP today, and you are scratching your head trying to understand it, you’re not alone. It’s complicated. This definition was created to provide context on Genesis tokens. However, the definition fails in many fringe cases, such as:

* ECT and Seed round neurons that locked and/or increased their dissolve delay are still considered non-circulating even though their owners performed a market action (extending their dissolve delay) and are participating in governance.
* ICP that DFINITY holds on behalf of other entities are considered non-circulating even though the ICP is owned by those other entities.
* ICP unclaimed (usually ECT and Seed) will always be considered in the non-circulating supply, despite the fact that it is not owned by the foundation and has a high likelihood of becoming dormant. For comparison, Satoshi’s bitcoin (similarly dormant) is considered part of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

**DFINITY’s Proposed Formula**

While there are many different definitions for Circulating Supply, DFINITY prefers to align with [Coin Market Cap’s definition](https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043396252-Supply-Circulating-Total-Max-) due to their premier status within the industry. Their definition is: “The best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public’s hands.” The two main parts of this definition are:

* “Circulating in the market” - DFINITY understands this to mean tokens being used for a market purpose, such as governance (staked on the NNS), utility (liquidity in applications, payment, etc) or hodling.
* “General public’s hands” - DFINITY understands this to mean tokens not held by the Foundation.

With the above definitions, a very simple definition for circulating supply emerges:

ICP Circulating Supply = [Total Supply of ICP] minus [Liquid Tokens Owned by DFINITY]

We believe this definition both aligns ICP with other L1 blockchain practices, adheres to the best practices from leading crypto voices like CoinMarketCap and provides a simple definition that is easy to understand and is useful for which to base decisions on.

Under this definition, the circulating supply of ICP today would be ~416M ICP. This would put the percent of circulating supply to total supply at ~84%, which is in line with our peers.

Note - in some cases DFINITY has a contractual obligation to transfer ICP to another party. Under this definition, that ICP would remain in non-circulating supply until the date of transfer, at which point it would enter circulating supply.

**Benefits of Changing CS Definition**

To summarize the above text, DFINITY believes that changing the Circulating Supply definition will have the following benefits:

* The definition will become simpler and easier to understand, enabling better decision-making based on the circulating supply.
* Align ICP’s definition closer to the practices of our peers
* Reduce inaccurate impressions of future dilution

**Feedback from CMC:**

DFINITY recognizes that CoinMarketCap is looked upon within the industry as the leading source of coin information. We have reached out to them to ensure our intended approach aligns with their expectations and their understanding of similar situations for L1 blockchains. The feedback we received was:

* There are challenges to defining circulating supply due to particularities for each coin
* The community should read this article for context: https://blockworks.co/news/okb-okx-market-cap-10-billion
* ICP has unique qualities, like on-chain governance, that make a good case for updating the circulating supply
* Token ownership and control are important considerations when determining circulating supply definitions.
* There could be an industry opportunity for a new metric that conveys “what can be sold” based on the industry’s adoption of staking and token-locking contracts but there would be challenges in: 1) using it as a ranking mechanism due to the ease in which a project could allocate all the assets to the team and subsequently unlock everything to manipulate its rank. [Hayden from Uniswap](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1436432658700115998) is aware of how easy it is to game the system. 2) Tracking unlocked vs locked assets in a programmatic fashion.
* Shared appreciation over DFINITY / Internet Computer’s transparent approach to this discussion and the intent to ratify the definition through a DAO vote.

We will share this forum post and the subsequent comments with Coin Market Cap and invite them to provide feedback on the definition.

**Next Steps**

DFINITY is interested in the community’s thoughts regarding this topic. After discussion, if the community is in agreement with a definition, DFINITY plans to submit a motion proposal to the NNS for governance approval. If the proposal is approved then DFINITY will update the formula on the dashboard for Circulating Supply and will update any required integrations with external partners like CoinMarketCap.

EDITS:
1. Updated the link to CoinMarketCap's definition.
2. Updated the text under "Feedback from CMC" per their feedback after reading the post and subsequent discussion.  Note - we will continue to seek feedback from CMC as this discussion evolves.
3. Updated expected change in circulating supply based on more recent data.

@Kyle_Langham very illuminating post (even if it illuminated the varieties and vagueness of industry at times). I do like things going towards simple.

Clarifying Question: I understand from your post that the locking/unlocking or staking/dissolving of tokens into neurons would not affect circulating supply under proposed definition (and general standards). Did I get that right? No bias either way, just wanted to confirm I understood as intended.

@Kyle_Langham can you elaborate on the definition of “Liquid Tokens owned by DFINITY”?

What are all of the different pieces that would make up this definition? Are the 4xxx neurons that have unlocked/dissolved part of the circulating supply?


Also, what is the end goal here - to raise the ICP market cap as shown on Coinmarketcap?

@diegop My understanding is that this the only changes would be for ECR/Seed investors who make an active “lock” or “increase dissolve delay” action.

@Kyle_Langham is this right?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-05 17:14:49 UTC | #5

Hi @diegop, that is correct.  Everything staked on the NNS (whether dissolving or locked) would be considered circulating under the proposed definition.  The argument is that it would align with our understanding of "circulating in the market".  Given that ICP can be used as a governance token, all staked tokens are being used for intended market action.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-05 17:22:23 UTC | #6

"Liquid tokens owned by DFINITY" would be all tokens not staked on the NNS in which DFINITY has legal ownership and full control.

The 4xxx neurons would be considered circulating under the proposed definition by nature of them being staked on the NNS.  (See my response to Diego just above).

In terms of end goal - we want to simplify the CS definition (as it stands today it is extremely challenging to understand and therefore useless in decision-making) and we want to standardize to common industry practices (as best as possible) to allow crypto stakeholders to compare apples to apples.

Edit: I have a personal desire to simplify the CS definition because I get asked often about the definition and (a) have trouble explaining it and (b) have trouble justifying it.  A simpler and more meaningful CS definition will make my job easier :slight_smile:

Why are these not considered part of the circulating supply? It seems like they could “technically” be sold at any point, no?

> Why are these not considered part of the circulating supply? It seems like they could “technically” be sold at any point, no?

Yes, that is true, however most leaders in the industry consider liquid foundation tokens to be non-circulating, I believe because they represent "dilution risk".  I know that CoinMarketCap prefers this as well.  However, it's important to say that this isn't necessarily followed by all coins, as ADA, TRON and Aptos all have circulating supplies >%98, suggesting either their foundations have dumped their tokens or they are not considering part of their circulating supply.  Regardless of those coins' approaches to CS, our intended goal is to match the practices of the industry at large, which involves calling the Foundation's liquid tokens to be non-circulating.

> Also, what is the total amount of this liquid token supply owned by DFINITY (what impact would it have if it was considered part of the circulating supply)?

The foundation currently has 98.8M ICP tokens liquid that it, as of today, owns and controls.  It's worth noting that the foundation also has contractual obligations to disburse some of those tokens at pre-defined dates.  I don't have the details of those obligations.  At the time that the foundation fulfills those obligations, that ICP would be considered circulating because it would no longer be owned or controlled by the foundation.  Also note, the Foundation has 28M ICP in 8-year neurons.

@Kyle_Langham, thanks for the post.

I can understand your desire to have a working definition, and CMC's seems reasonable.

My understanding of DFINITY from public statements is that they officially view themselves as one of many contributors to the IC, in theory no more separated from the general public than any other large contributor that might desire to step up and propose NNS changes. If that is the case, it seems better to include their tokens in the CS, regardless of how other foundations view themselves.

The point on which I've seen more criticism is in leaving staked maturity out of the CS. Since staked maturity is used in governance, has value, and can become tradable fairly quickly, what are your thoughts about including it in the CS count?

-------------------------

FranHefner | 2023-04-05 19:57:51 UTC | #11


This topic is very interesting! I think we should keep it simple and see what you really think when you read the " **circulating supply**"

The simplest thing that occurs to me and I think it is the most accurate is...

**The circulating supply is all the coins that could be sold/traded on a DEX or CEX.**

**Things that are NOT circulating supply: Everything that is staking, everything that is blocked to add liquidity in the dex, everything that for any technical reason cannot be moved or sold.**

-------------------------

diegop | 2023-04-05 20:04:50 UTC | #12

@FranHefner Just a quick thought inspired by what you wrote:

I think one of the main realizations @Kyle_Langham has come across in his research and conversations, is that this discussion is *partly* logic... and *partly* "how much should ICP community conform to a general status of industry standards so people can compare apples to apples" as much as possible in an imperfect world.

This is a valid argument.  The IC is unique to all other coins because of the NNS's total control over the protocol code base.  I think this requires a little more research on my end.

> The point on which I’ve seen more criticism is in leaving staked maturity out of the CS. Since staked maturity is used in governance, has value, and can become tradable fairly quickly, what are your thoughts about including it in the CS count?

Because supply is consistently defined as tokens minted across the industry, we've been reluctant to include maturity in any supply metric (since it is not yet minted ICP), including circulating supply and inflation calculations.  My two cents is bringing maturity into the definition would take us away from our two goals of (1) creating a simpler definition and (2) aligning with our peers.  Although you bring up a valid point that staked maturity does serve a market purpose in governance.

Forreal | 2023-04-05 21:46:21 UTC | #14

1. Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of assets that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands. We have found that Circulating Supply is a much better metric than [Total Supply](https://coinmarketcap.com/glossary/#total-supply) for determining the market capitalization. The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using [public float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_float) to determine the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.
2. Assets that are locked (via smart contracts or legal contracts), allocated to the team or private investors, or not able to be sold on the public market, cannot affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:



The quote above I got from CMC definition. Staked ICP would not meet the criteria to be added as circulating supply.

-------------------------

levi | 2023-04-05 22:25:04 UTC | #15

How about not using this ambiguous phrase and instead using new terms that clarify the specific meaning. 

Dfinity foundation liquid tokens: xx 
Dfinity foundation 8-year-staked tokens: xx 
Total tokens staked for 8-years: xx
Total tokens staked for at least a year: xx
Total tokens not staked: xx
Total staked maturity: xx
Maturity definition: staking rewards with an ability to liquidate subject to a 7 day modulation period. 

If the goal is to be clear, then use the clearest terms possible.

Good question. The intent (I believe) is to surface a definition or number for coin market cap and others. **The numbers you mention are all already public info** I believe, but the issue is placed like CMC don’t just take these numbers, but ask for an aggregate because they ask communities of L1s to provide their own definition of CS.

Does that make sense?

If the definitions of CS are different for each coin, then it makes no sense to compare coins using the “CS” which is what CMC is doing with their chart.

If there must be a number, my view is to put the total supply.

profudge30 | 2023-04-05 23:46:40 UTC | #18

They mention in the post, coins held by neurons on the nns(staked) would be considered circulating supply. Liquid, is any coin not held by the DFINITY foundation.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-04-06 00:23:01 UTC | #19

So the market cap will increase to $2 billion within a day? Does nobody see a problem with that?
It’s going to get spammed everywhere that icps circulating supply increased by 35% in a day initially. How many other coins that despise icp will take advantage of this is what I’m wondering.
So if people panic dump we could see the current mcap again which would put the coin a 3.25. We could also panic dump and recover to the current price once every one finds out nothing technically changed. Or we could panic dump and slightly recover to a 1.75 mcap with the new circulating supply.
All I’m saying is if the circulating supply and market cap increase by 35% within a single day and the price is the same people will take advantage of this to cause panic ESPECIALLY with this coin

-------------------------

romulusp | 2023-04-06 04:35:58 UTC | #22

All the time was there, in that 35 milion i have around 600 lock for 8 years non disolving, is the people ICP not Dfinity. Many will still keep in maturity and not disolving .

I'm no wise man, but this is exactly what I predict would happen.

Anything that changes market cap suddenly would be seen as market manipulation, regardless of what arguments DFINITY Foundation would have. It would really damage the image that we IC community  project (as if we had a positive image to begin with!).

After all, what is wrong with sticking with current definition? After 2 more years, circulating would be close to market cap anyway.

What is there to gain with changing the definition? "Catching up with industrial norm"? @Kyle_Langham How many do you think would care had you not raised this topic?

Hi All,

With my non developer background the input I would have,

Why don’t we keep Bitcoin as the prime example. 

Anything that’s not been mined, is not part of the market cap, If it doesn’t exist it shouldn’t be part of the calculation.

At the same time, lost btc remains part of the btc circulating supply calculation.

My own conclusion:
Staked icp exist, hence they should be part of the supply.

Icp that exists only as “voting power for maturity” from an existing neuron, doesnt actually exist yet, it shouldn’t be part of the circulating supply  

I understand btc and icp are 2 totally different fruits, but if we wanna stick with the core philosophy we should always look back at the founding tech and draw our conclusion from there, sometimes. (Not all the time)

-------------------------

benji | 2023-04-06 09:09:22 UTC | #27

I would agree that we shouldn't change the CS definition because investors are irrational.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-06 12:25:18 UTC | #28

Hi @levi.  I definitely agree that the CS phrase is ambiguous.  Unfortunately, since it's the standard metric within the industry our choice is to adopt it and try to make the most sense of it, or not be listed in most aggregate.

I like your idea of creating our own meaningful metrics, useful for our community.  You list a few good ones.  The following are on the dashboard (dashboard.internetcomputer.org) and the other ones I can talk to the dashboard team about adding.
> Dfinity foundation 8-year-staked tokens: xx
> Total tokens staked for 8-years: xx
> Total tokens staked for at least a year: xx
> Total tokens not staked: xx

> If there must be a number, my view is to put the total supply.

Yes, I agree with this statement, particularly given how the industry has changed in the last two years (DeFi contracts, governance, etc).  It would require a large change within the industry, but I would support a move towards this goal for the industry.

@Forreal - we discussed whether staked tokens should be considered non-circulating for the reason you pointed out.  Ultimately we could not find a single case where that standard was upheld... every single proof of stake coin considers the staked coins to be circulating.  We later got clarification from CMC that "locked" in this context is similar to the term "escrow".

> The quote above I got from CMC definition. Staked ICP would not meet the criteria to be added as circulating supply.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-06 12:16:48 UTC | #29

Coin Market Cap mentioned that its somewhat common for coins to change their circulating supply metric, however this is the first time a coin has done so transparently.  Usually it occurs behind the scenes with a change in the coin's financial APIs and third parties (like CoinMarketCap) are left with the responsibility of discovering it and making a decision on whether the new definition is within reason of industry expectations.  From this, I gather that there is low risk of being accused of market manipulation, particularly since we have chosen a path of full transparency.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-04-06 13:18:56 UTC | #30

I guarantee if you guys change the definition it’s going to hurt all investors. I don’t think you understand how irrational people are especially when all you need to cause panic is say icp increased their circulating supply by 35% and just have a before and after pic. That alone will cause the price to drop.
I say don’t this change and leave it be. There’s no problems with the definition. 
If you guys do decide to change the definition please let everyone know exactly when so I can short this coin temporarily.

If a company discovers inaccuracies in their valuations and does not correct them due to fear of appearances, that is considered market manipulation.

This is a case where the lack of universal standards probably means there is no legal liability, but that is beside the point. A healthy organization strives to be accurate in its accounting because that is what is fair to their investors and best for their long term interests.

mrwangharuto | 2023-04-06 19:29:49 UTC | #34

Hello @kpeacock and DFINITY team, I think you should consider make a ver simple Circulation Supply definition as the amount of tokens available and liquid in the market, because you have created an outstanding architecture, you can perfectly differenciate the amount of ICP in the addresses from the ICP staked in the neurons, so a simple definition would be:

" All the ICP tokens in addresses ready to transfer or use is by the owner is a circulation supply"

" All the ICP tokens staked in the NNS as neurons are not circulation supply"

Total Supply = Circulation supply + Staked Supply

I do not think maturity should be considered as Staked supply until the spawn neuron is made.

I do not think DFINITY tokens should be excluded from the Circulation Supply, why is that? If DFINITY Foundation has the tokens ready to use, those tokens are also circulation supply. If they want to put the tokens to non circulation supply then, they can lock the tokens as a neuron.

And to finalize, if DFINITY foundation and Members of the dfinity team have so many tokens supply that it's affecting the amount of circulation supply or total supply of tokens, they can always as they do, make more bounty programs, burn a part of the tokens they hold (I mean, if there is a huge amount of them, burn some would not impact their wealth...). 

Hope it helps, anyway, whatever the final definition, I love what you are building and congrats to dfinity's team members.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-06 19:44:51 UTC | #35

I don't have any concrete examples, but I can reach back out to CMC to see if they will provide some.

I agree with @Jabberwocky and @benji that there is the potential for inaccurate conclusions to occur if we change the CS definition, particularly by persons who have not read this forum thread.  Prior to making the original forum post, we discussed that internally as a potential risk and concluded the benefit of making a more clear definition and aligning with peers outweighed that potential risk.  I welcome the community's feedback on that assessment.

For anyone concerned with the risk discussed above, I'd recommend Messari's circulating supply charts as a great reference to investigate more.  A few charts that show a large jump in CS are:

I'm not sure @Jabberwocky and @benji what the problem would be if ICP went to $3.25 as a result of brute's selling after the circulating supply was adjusted. It would be temporary. It would be the transfer of ICP from weak hands to strong hands - normal market occurrence.
Buying opportunity of a lifetime and 8-year gang holders don't care either, we have an 8-year long term outlook in my opinion.

dfisher | 2023-04-06 20:23:56 UTC | #37

I’d like to echo concerns pointed out here. 

I do think any change in the definition of circulating supply will land us with accusations of market manipulation. We want to be known for our technology, and this may end up causing unwanted negative attention. 

If I understand correctly, the change in the definition will cause our ranking to go from 41 to like 35. I’m not sure it’s worth the brain damage for such a small movement.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-04-06 21:13:50 UTC | #38

You can guarantee a price dump from this change but cannot guarantee it will be restored to the same price once everything cools off

-------------------------

mrwangharuto | 2023-04-06 23:14:24 UTC | #39

I agree with @Jabberwocky, maybe this is not the best time, in a bear market, to make this kind of adjustments, we could wait until a bull run occurs, the ICP holder community has already suffered enough holding ICP tokens which have been continuosly dumping in price. 

In my opinion maybe focus on ckETH, BadLands, and other functionalities prior this theoretical definitions without any use case would be a better path for now.

We can delay this for a while and adjust when the time is more favorable.

Does not circulating mean coins that can be bought and sold but Staked coins are not coins at all but are promised when they are un-staked and then put into circulation and be counted.

My Staked coins have already been counted and Spawned coins in Neuron will not be available to the end of a staked period and will have no bearing on the market till they are released which then will be added to the total supply and counted.

Staking is a voting power ONLY!.

Tron - Max Supply -- Not Known - Total Supply 90,934,599,345

Polkadot - Max Supply -- Not Known - Total Supply 1,300,256,554

Solana Max Supply -- Not Known Total Supply 539,312,705

Max supply states that: 
The maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency. It is analogous to the fully diluted shares in the stock market.

If this data has not been submitted by the project or verified by the CMC team, max supply shows

But a new thing I have noticed: 
The CoinMarketCap team has verified the project's circulating supply to be as follows:

ICP
Max Supply -- Not Known
Total Supply 497,342,812

Verified Data
The CoinMarketCap team has verified the project's circulating supply to be as follows:
Circulating Supply 298,492,813 ICP

As I understand it the max supply when not stated can change quickly, not by stakers but the Coin owners themselves or maybe one day the Stakers.

The system as I see it is correctly stated and will be updated when the circumstances change.

The Max Supply of ICP can be changed in the future by Billions or even Trillions. It makes sense to me. If the IC is the new Internet then the max coins will have to grow to accommodate the cycles needed and if the coin is set to Max of 24m, would then be worth the price of BTC.

Will the ICP coin ever be worth anything but a cycle?

I would like to see a max supply as you don’t need to but a whole coin.

It appears much of the feedback in this forum thread is aligning towards concern that changing the CS definition may have an immediate negative impact on the price of the token.  I'm interested in learning more about this view in order to understand it better.  @Jabberwocky , @mrwangharuto , @dfisher @benji - could you explain more please?  Particularly useful would be examples, articles or analyses that demonstrate and/or support your concern and would be useful for understanding your position.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-04-07 02:54:04 UTC | #42

As an example, the FUD around launch caused a big distraction redirecting focus away from ICP technology. We wanted people to focus on the tech, and instead they questioned the integrity of the Dfinity team and we were left talking about things to the broader crypto world we didn’t want to focus on. That was not our fault, but it is an example of a major distraction.

I fear the non-ICP broader crypto public (Justin Bons of the world) are not looking to give us the benefit of the doubt, and will accuse us of trying to manipulate the CS in order to climb the rankings. It should be pointed out that we are not currently (yet) trusted and viewed favorably by the broader crypto ecosystem, and this could worsen things.

I could be wrong, but it is certainly a risk we should consider.

Try this with average crypto Joe, which explanation will he understand?

1. DFINITY just released XXX more coins into circulation.
2. (insert your favorite explanation of why previous CS was wrong, and new CS is right)

It doesn't matter if (1) is plainly wrong. I guarantee you it will be the dominating narrative if we do this.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-04-07 12:46:09 UTC | #47

These are my calculations on this topic with explanations:
* Total supply = all tokens on ICP Ledger [including total amount of ICP tokens in neurons (dissolve delay ≥ 0)]
* Circulating supply = all tokens on ICP Ledger [including total amount of ICP tokens dissolved in neurons (dissolve delay = 0)]

1. During the calculations, all neurons in the network should be considered equally, regardless of who they belong to and whether they were received during genesis by their controllers or not.
2. Maturity, IS NOT an ICP token and isn't exchangeable exactly 1:1, so it should not be taken into account at all when calculating the total amount of ICP in circulation.
3. I believe that this is the most logical and objective approach to this topic.

All neurons are these same, MATURITY ≠ ICP and that's only true definition.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-07 14:09:17 UTC | #48

There was an entire section dedicated to maturity in the [NNS and ICP Token Report](https://medium.com/dfinity/nns-and-icp-token-metrics-quarterly-report-first-quarter-2023-af960647a47f), published earlier this week.  There's also a real-time display of maturity on the dashboard (as you referenced later in this forum).

## TLDR: 

Since I am **NOT** working on this topic as @Kyle_Langham is (all I know is what is written in this forum just like everyone else), I wanted to hopefully simplify some of the complexity I see here and share my personal (non-DFINITY) opinion. I am just **one voice** and of course respect and acquiesce 🫡 to the community. 

## Question at hand

1. One of @Kyle_Langham 's responsibilities is to further transparency (by making data much easier to access and to understand). A lot of it is due to to feedback from folks like yourself and broader crypto. He has worked a lot on this and continues, of course.

2. One of the common complaints he has heard from folks is that there are parts of ICP that may be reasonable or logical, but they differ too much from the norm to make comparisons helpful. 

3. This is why @Kyle_Langham created this post: 

The question he is struggling with is less "*what is the most accurate way to represent CS?*" 

and more...

***"How much should ICP definitions/terms modify to go along with crypto standards?"***

Modifying to go along with standards may have short term repercussions (or none at all), but the question is how much adapting to standards is important and how much appetite there is.

## My personal (non-DFINITY opinion):

1. I think we should clean up whatever we can to make things easier to compare.

2. I am not sure I agree that Foundation tokens should be outside the CS, but I recognize that if that is what many L1s and Foundations do, *it is more important that we all drive in the same side of the road than to argue right or left.*

3. I admit I am ok with the trolls of the world jumping on this if it means making ICP easier to understand and compare for broader base in the long run. I am not convinced it will be that meaningful or distracting since there already are trolls who spread FUD, but I empathize with those concerned.

4. I believe that other projects have changed the CS definition on CMC, and usually without any deliberation (and honestly no real correlation to impact). What is unusual here is that this is being discussed.

5. Quite frankly, I find the total supply and supply not locked in smart contracts more helpful definitions to the intent of what CS was originally aiming for, but I recognize that industry is converging on what CS should be. I think these number should be easily discoverable (and applaud @Kyle_Langham for making them so).

## What my thinking hinges on

Like @Kyle_Langham I want to see the community's perspective on this, but I also intend to make my own decision. Here are some areas where my current thinking hinges:

a. My thinking hinges on my understanding on what "driving on the same side of the road" is, as much as possible in an imperfect world. Data could change that.

b. My thinking hinges on my understanding that CS definition changes in other L1s have not been much more than short term blips or discussions after the fact. 

c. I read CMC's feedback from @Kyle_Langham (and know they are reading this forum), so I am using this as information. 

[quote="Kyle_Langham, post:1, topic:19297"]
**Feedback from CMC:**

DFINITY recognizes that CoinMarketCap is looked upon within the industry as the leading source of coin information. We have reached out to them to ensure our intended approach aligns with their expectations and their understanding of similar situations for L1 blockchains. The feedback we received was:

* There are challenges to defining circulating supply due to particularities for each coin
* The community should read this article for context: [$10B Mystery: Is OKB Really the 7th Largest Crypto? - Blockworks ](https://blockworks.co/news/okb-okx-market-cap-10-billion)
* ICP has unique qualities, like on-chain governance, that make a good case for updating the circulating supply
* Token ownership and control are important considerations when determining circulating supply definitions.
* There could be an industry opportunity for a new metric that conveys “what can be sold” based on the industry’s adoption of staking and token-locking contracts but there would be challenges in: 1) using it as a ranking mechanism due to the ease in which a project could allocate all the assets to the team and subsequently unlock everything to manipulate its rank. [Hayden from Uniswap](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1436432658700115998) is aware of how easy it is to game the system. 2) Tracking unlocked vs locked assets in a programmatic fashion.
* Shared appreciation over DFINITY / Internet Computer’s transparent approach to this discussion and the intent to ratify the definition through a DAO vote.

We will share this forum post and the subsequent comments with Coin Market Cap and invite them to provide feedback on the definition.

If we do this, we do it for the right reasons - to make it simpler and more comparable.

But isn't the whole problem here that there *are no* standards?

If the goal is to look like other coins we can define CS as 80% of TS and be done 🤷‍♂️ Simple and easy to calculate. My point about accuracy assumed that this measurement had real utility, but if it's akin to picking which side of the road to drive on, I agree with @diegop that there's no need to argue.

I also agree with @dfisher and @diegop that public impression on this particular issue shouldn't inform policy. But imo doing this for the right reasons means obtaining a number that conveys something real to investors for them to base their decisions on.

[/quote]

To be honest, this is the initial main question: 
1. *How much do we want to spend energy creating a metric that best represents the nuances of ICP* vs *How much energy do we want to spend energy adjusting to go with as close to standard as possible*? This is a very valid question and I do not think it has an obvious answer. I just posted my own opinion that CS is most helpful as a comparable metric.

2. I do not discourage and in fact even ENCOURAGE that we continue adding metrics to dashboards to allow users to understand the nuances of ICP ecosystem. That way we have our cake and eat it too:

* provide high-level metric for comparing apples to apples
* provide data so people diving to understand can see how the ecosystem breaks out, etc...

You are right @Jonathan . @Kyle_Langham is doing his best to provide some patterns, (maybe "patterns" is better than "standards"), and it's possible that even if one agrees we should focus CS on industry patterns, one may disagree with what those patterns tell us. That is question #2 if one agrees what direction CS should take

-------------------------

benji | 2023-04-09 19:51:00 UTC | #55

I agree that it's important to increase transparency in every aspect and the CS is very important. However considering 1/ the lack of standards and 2/ potential reactions from people not familiar with ICP, is it possible to defer this exercise until when the market situation starts to improve?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-10 16:11:13 UTC | #56

To summarize the feedback I've received, below is the concerns expressed, organized in order by the number of community members who have expressed them.  Please let me know if I've missed anything:
1. **Narrative/Price** - the change in CS may create FUD around market manipulation and negatively impact price.
2. **New metric** - DFINITY should create new and more meaningful metrics.
2. **Staked ICP** - tokens locked on the NNS should not be part of the CS.
3. **DFINITY tokens** - all of DFINITY's tokens should be included in the CS.
4.  **Maturity** - Arguments both for and against including maturity in CS.

I will be discussing these concerns internally within DFINITY to determine the best path forward.  My current thinking on each items is:
1. **Narrative/Price** - (a) I think this forum thread is a great counter argument against any FUD. (b) CoinMarketCap expressed that coins update their definitions of CS, but this is the first time it's ever been done transparently and (c) I did a statistical analysis of large jumps in CS and price performance for 7 days and 30 days and found no correlation.  From a statistical point of view, this topic is completely independent of price action.
2. **New metric** - I fully agree with this and plan to continue that work with Coin Market Cap.
2. **Staked ICP** - Excluding NNS staked ICP from CS would take us away from our goal of aligning with our peers as I have found no examples of a coin that does that  in the top 50 coins (great example - 100% of ETH tokens are in their CS).  Coin Market Cap also confirmed that their usage of the term "locked" is in relation to an escrow-like situations, not staking as a utility of the coin.
3. **DFINITY tokens** - this argument, based on the unique fact that the foundation does not control the IC but rather is a contributor to it, is valid and requires more thought.
4.  **Maturity** - The industry is pretty consistent in supply being limited to minted tokens.  That's true for inflation calculations and supply metrics.  Including maturity would take us away from our goal of aligning to the industry.

Just out of curiosity, or to play devil's advocate perhaps… what changes (if any) are code changes in this motion proposal? will it be to update the API's? 

To be honest, I am trying to (slowly perhaps) increase my voting standards and am struggling with my decision on this proposal. I will be watching the conversation and I'll vote on my own accord (as always), however, in full disclosure I am leaning towards "No".

There is no need to redefine the circulating supply of ICP. It is a little too early for those changes. I personally do not think fitting into the current market rankings is necessary for the growth of the ecosystem

[quote="Kyle_Langham, post:1, topic:19297"]
For comparison, Satoshi’s bitcoin (similarly dormant) is considered part of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.
[/quote]
This definition put Bitcoin market structure at risk. By knowing the total supply governments can team up and control Bitcoin market structure at their pleasure. They can buy and dump whenever they want with high certainty hence controlling the Bitcoin market flow. Of course there exists a resistance, but by knowing circulating supply they have enough information to control BTC and benefit to having a say when the price is to be high and low with high precision. I tend to be more defensive, but my overall general thought is that NOT KNOWING TOTAL CIRCULATING SURPLY IS A SAFETY PRECAUTION TO AVOID A RAG AND PULL. Not knowing total circulating supply further allows the market to react naturally to demand and supply.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-04-11 13:13:34 UTC | #63

If:
ICP Circulating Supply = [Total Supply of ICP] minus [Liquid Tokens Owned by DFINITY]
it means that:
ICP Not Circulating Supply = Liquid Tokens Owned by DFINITY

I don't think it's reasonable to exclude the tokens of a given network participant just because he has a lot of them. Doesn't such a definition put DFINITY above all other ICP token holders?
In other networks, a given foundation is usually the only developer. In our case, it was supposed to be different...

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-11 13:53:44 UTC | #64

Yes, I think this is a logical argument that ICP Circulating Supply could/should equal its Total Supply.  We discussed this option internally and decided it was best to follow our goal of aligning to our peers (which usually do not include foundation liquid supply in the circulating supply).  CoinMarketCap also acknowledged this difference in our conversations and also expressed unease with a definition that produced circulating supply equal to total supply (even though some coins have already gone that route).

We (the ICP community) could explore the option of saying all coins are circulating.

[/quote]
I can understand their unease at having CS = TS. Is there perhaps a reasonable way to instead limit the inclusion of staked coins in CS?

For example, counting 8-year, non-dissolving neurons as "circulating" seems inconsistent with the purpose of having staked ICP to begin with. Isn't the non-liquid nature of these assets the very thing that gives them value to the IC ecosystem?

I understand this would go against current behaviors in the industry, but I would like to know what CMC thinks about this. Since they are the ones displaying this information as a market indicator, perhaps they can provide some guidance as to what they are trying to convey and where to place these limits.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-04-11 18:51:28 UTC | #66

Thank you for this topic @Kyle_Langham, I like the proposed change bacause:
- it will be easy to see if DFINITY is selling ICP
  - might help a lot against FUD which uses such argument
- the `Circulating Supply` stats on CMC will (hopefully) stop increasing every month by millions
  - the number which causes feeling of inflation will be more stable

Only other thing which I believe might be useful (on CMC) is to add some `Liquid supply` stats - which is (from my understanding) what is now reported as `Circulating Supply`.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-04-12 05:49:02 UTC | #67

If we want to have info on liquid supply perhaps a better place to show that would be the IC dashboard. Not sure we need to display all that data on CMC since it’s just supposed to be a place to benchmark, not do real analytics. 

Only on the IC dashboard, it would be nice to show a bridge between liquid supply -> circulating supply -> total supply -> total supply + staked maturity -> total supply + total maturity (which includes maturity that is not staked).  

Personally for me (I know ppl disagree), but I think liquid supply + maturity that is not staked is the truest measure of liquidity.

@Kyle_Langham let me know your thoughts

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-04-12 04:41:25 UTC | #68

Sure why not, a lot of the stats are already visible on https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons and https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation, but it might be convenient to have a dedicated `Supply` tab or graph.

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-13 21:01:45 UTC | #73

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2023-04-14 05:57:14 UTC | #74

Just want to point out that although I do think there are market benefits to us adjusting our CS upward, there are reasons to accurately report the limit of our CS as well due to laws of supply and demand. 

Ultimately I hope this discussion will inspire CMC to introduce new standards that will allow us to really compare our ecosystem and value to others. And I think we have nothing to fear.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-04-18 19:38:12 UTC | #76

As a follow up to NNS proposal 117360, DFINITY plans to update the Circulating Supply API within the next 24 hours per the new Circulating Supply definition. The change will be first reflected on the IC dashboard and then will propagate to coin aggregators on their subsequent data pulls (daily in most cases).

**A Quick Recap**

DFINITY recognized that the definition they chose for Circulating Supply (CS) at mainnet launch was (1) not aligned with ICP’s peers and (2) was overly complicated and confusing. After researching and discussing with major market leaders like Coin Market Cap, DFINITY recommended to the ICP community a change in the CS definition to define the metric as all tokens except the Foundation’s liquid tokens (Circulating Supply = [Total Supply] minus [Liquid Tokens Owned by the Foundation]). The new definition was recommended with the dual goals of (1) aligning to industry peers and (2) producing a simpler definition that is more understandable. The forum thread above captures the conversation around that discussion.

The high-level justifications for the chosen definition are:

* ICP staked on the NNS is being used for the designed utility of the ICP token (governance participation) and therefore all tokens staked on the NNS should be included in the CS.
* All staked tokens on the NNS are controlled by their owners (i.e., there are no escrow-like situations in which the token holder is not in control of actions taken to the token).
* The industry tends to consider liquid tokens held by the foundations to be non-circulating.

After community discussion, DFINITY proposed to ratify the new definition with the NNS DAO through a motion proposal. [That proposal was adopted](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/117360) with 99.5% of votes in favor. DFINITY is now ready to execute the proposal by updating the circulating supply APIs.

The net impact of this change in definition will be the inclusion of ~132M ICP into the circulating supply. ICP’s circulating supply to total supply ratio will be ~86%, which is in line with ICP’s peers.

If you have any questions, please reply to this post and I’ll address them.  Thanks!

Edit 1: Updated new CS tokens figure and CS:TS ratio.  Previous numbers had an error in the calculation.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2023-04-18 19:24:16 UTC | #77

@dfisher, I agree with displaying a reconciliation between the different totals on the dashboard as a type of continuity schedule. I have asked for that before as well.

Maturity should definitely be included in some total if the numbers are going to be comparable to shares in a company, since maturity represents a current claim on the overall value of the token economy. Maturity is equivalent to outstanding shares that have not yet been issued, similar to how fully diluted share counts work. Maturity tokens are the same as money already spent, shares already outstanding with third parties, or stock options currently exercisable, since they can no longer create any future benefit to the token economy. They can only benefit the owner of the maturity. By contrast, foundation tokens are arguably equivalent to treasury shares that were "issued" but are no yet "outstanding" as a claim on net assets, since all those tokens can still be spent later (e.g., on R&D resources, project bounties, marketing, etc.) to increase the value of the token economy. 

As a result, the "circulating supply" number is basically irrelevant. To me, the market cap. of ICP must logically be the token price X total tokens with an external claim on the value of the token economy. In my view, that is equivalent to token price X (total token supply + all maturity - foundation tokens). If someone disagrees, please explain why.

The price of ICP was rising nicely until this proposal went into effect. Suddenly, ICP appeared in the TOP 30 of CoinMarketCap and the price does a pullback (people came to the conclusion that it was some manipulation of the real supply of tokens).

(NO) thank everyone who supported her!

The entire crypto market has been moving in the same direction over the same timeframe.  I’m not convinced the correlation proves causation between ICP price and CS definition change when the broader crypto market is seeing analogous performance.
