What will happen if I do something like this
```
ic_cdk::call::<(), ()>(ic_cdk::id(), "_test_fn", ());
```

I tried, and it looks like nothing happened at all - `_test_fn()` is never called.
Am I doing something wrong, or it is forbidden by design?

I figured it out myself - the method gets called as expected.
