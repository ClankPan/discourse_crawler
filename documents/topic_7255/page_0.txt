Consider adding a large-scale and ongoing bug bounty program. I believe DFINITY now has a responsible security vulnerability disclosure process, which is one excellent step in the right direction. But I think DFINITY should also allocate a large amount of funds towards rewarding those who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities. I think this program warrants multiple millions of dollars towards responsible disclosure.

I am not confident the system is secure when it has only been looked over by members of the Foundation, or those close to them (I assume this has been the case, I could be wrong).

I second this, not much else to say. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:

If you want small-scale instead of large-scale there is https://github.com/nomeata/capture-the-ic-token ;-)

Hahaha, I haven't been able to break that one yet. Super fun

Great feedback! The foundation is moving towards Vulnerability Rewards Program from just being a disclosure program as we speak. The foundation is looking to reward those who come up with significant security findings.

Great news, thank you!

I hope the rewards will be competitive to attract the best hackers and security researchers from inside and outside of crypto.

I want to update you all that I have escalated this. I know the security team has plans on this, but I want to see how much I can share (they are, by nature, a  friendly but secretive bunch ;) )

#ICP Dapp Vulnerability Reporting

**Ref: ISO/IEC 29147:2018**

**Issue**

The #ICP Dapp ecosystem also needs a conduit for #ICP Dapp vulnerability reporting and disposition. Most Dapp builders are very small compared to major tech vendors and are unlikely to have an established vulnerability disclosure process.

**Factors**

* As Dapps are deployed on the #ICP, vulnerabilities will be identified and there is a need to ensure quick and easy identification and communication.
* It is difficult to figure out to whom a vulnerability should be reported while ensuring confidentiality and consistent processes.
* Dapp developers are unlikely to register with their Common Vulnerability Exposure national authorities.

**Approach** :

Facilitation of the vulnerability process governed by a Vulnerability DAO (VulDAO) that would:

* act as the [CVE Numbering Authority (CNAs)](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCNA) for any apps registered with the DAO.
* Maintain a register containing the name of the Dapp, the reporting contact, the disclosure policy, vulnerability reports, and their disposition.
* register the DAO as the reporting mechanism with the CVE manager (There is no monetary fee for CVE CNA registration and no contract to sign).
* establish a public vulnerability disclosure policy and seek ratification.
* host a public web site ( **VulDapp** ) on the #ICP for new vulnerability disclosures.
* ensure members agree to the CVE terms of use of the CVE manager.

Sample Disclosure Policy

**REPORTING A VULNERABILITY**

We strongly encourage you to report potential security vulnerabilities using the VulDapp, before disclosing them in a public forum.

The VulDapp will maintain the list of security contacts for each registered Dapp.

Only use the VulDapp contact mechanism to report undisclosed security vulnerabilities for registered #ICP Dapps to facilitate the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. The VulDapp cannot accept regular bug reports or other security-related queries through this contact mechanism. Recipients will ignore communication sent to these contacts that does not relate to an undisclosed security problem in a #ICP Dapp registered with the #ICPVul Dapp.

Please send one plain-text message for each vulnerability you are reporting using the VulDapp . Rich content (diagrams, video, PDF, etc.) will not be accepted.

Please do not encrypt submissions.

**VULNERABILITY INFORMATION**

You can usually find information on known vulnerabilities for an registered Dapp on the Vuldapp web page. For convenience, consult the list for VulDAO listed projects. Do not ask:

* how to use the registered Dapp securely
* whether a published vulnerability applies to specific versions of the canister you are using
* whether a published vulnerability applies to the configuration of the canister you are using
* about obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* about the availability of patches and/or new releases to address a published vulnerability

The relevant Dapp would have a forum to ask such questions on their discord, telegram, twitter, etc. The registered Dapp team will ignore any such questions you send directly to them.

**VULNERABILITY HANDLING**

An overview of the vulnerability handling process is:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately using the VulDapp website
* The appropriate Dapp security team works privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
* The project creates a new release of the Dapp to deliver its fix.
* The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how the fix has been applied or how to apply the fix as appropriate.

@diegop Is there an update on an ongoing bug bounty program? I know this exists: https://dfinity.org/vulnerability-disclosure-program/ but there is no information on reward amounts if I'm not mistaken.

-------------------------

rsundar01 | 2022-03-27 06:38:50 UTC | #11

Hi lastmjs, We have been providing bounties the past few months even though it has not been explicitly mentioned on the program website. There is a quite of work that is going on currently and you should see the updates in the next few weeks. I will keep you posted.
