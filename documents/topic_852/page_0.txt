The [Motoko base library](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base) is now open on our DFINITY organization GitHub!

This is particularly exciting for developers, as it provides an example package for use with the [Vessel package manager](https://github.com/kritzcreek/vessel), enhanced testing and documentation, and the opportunity to contribute directly and expand the library.

Check out the announcement on Twitter (and the *amazing* Motoko animation) [here](https://twitter.com/dfinity/status/1280662788491243520?s=20)!
