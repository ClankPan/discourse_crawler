Folks, I am wondering why the Internet Computer as one of the first and basic use cases does not offer a truly decentralized cloud 3.0 compute platform for node operators of other chains. Would that not be the proof in the pudding for its cloud ambitions? Weaning Web3 nodes off hyperscaler platforms. Or did I miss it?
