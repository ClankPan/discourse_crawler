I tried to run the `icx-proxy` but received the following error after a GET request.
```

I'm guessing you built the ic-proxy binary from scratch recently.

If so, I believe you're running into this [bug](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/asset-canister-upload-script/9322/19?u=jzxchiang) with the agent-rs library.

I actually read that thread but didn't apply the change you suggested as the `Cargo.toml` already references the local version:

`ic-agent = { path = "../ic-agent", version = "0.10" }`

But I will try it and will get back to you, many thanks!

icx-proxy is now hosted here: https://github.com/dfinity/icx-proxy

The reason you are seeing that error is probably because https://github.com/dfinity/icx-proxy/blob/main/Cargo.toml#L27 still references ic-agent 0.9.  The error you're seeing started happening when building ic-agent 0.9 with reqwest 0.11.6 (and maybe 0.11.7).

Another option for running icx-proxy is to run the version bundled with dfx, which should avoid this problem: `$(dfx cache show)/icx-proxy <parameters>`
