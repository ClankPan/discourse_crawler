I found one in the wild that wasn't ICDevs.org. Any reason why this happens sometimes? A refresh almost always fixes it, but it isn't good ux.

Hey @skilesare 

OpenChat is not using a custom domain, but are going through Cloudflare. I don't know why they chose to do so and whether the frontend is hosted in a canister or somewhere else.

There can be multiple reasons why Cloudflare can't reach the origin if it is hosted on the IC. For example, the subnet hosting the canister is being upgraded. The canister itself is being upgraded. The boundary nodes have an issue.

I don't see any subnet upgrade happening at that time.
