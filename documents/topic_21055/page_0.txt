When making ICP mortgage into neurons
```
https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai/call
https://icp-api.io/api/v2/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai/call
```
Would requesting the two links have a different effect

Or you need to initiate a transfer to the neuron account when staking the neuron
```
https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai/call
https://icp-api.io/api/v2/canister/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai/call
```
Will these two paths be different?

Hi @ic_axb 

the three domains `ic0.app`, `ip0.io` and `icp-api.io` behave the same for API calls (query, update, read state, status). In your case, it doesn't make a difference whether you use one or the other.

There is however one difference between `icp-api.io` and the other two domains `ic0.app` and `icp0.io`. `icp-api.io` only serves the API endpoints, whereas the other two domains also serve the service worker and raw endpoints for the canister subdomains (e.g., `<canister-id>.ic0.app`).

For example, you can access the IC website over [`oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai.ic0.app`](https://oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai.ic0.app/), but not over [`oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai.icp-api.io`](https://oa7fk-maaaa-aaaam-abgka-cai.icp-api.io/).
