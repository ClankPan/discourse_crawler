In this [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/questions-about-commands-actions-to-go-through-sns-launch/31378/7?u=peterparker) it was mentioned that the `id` optional parameter of `ManageNeuron` should be discarded as it was the legacy way of specifying the id of the neuron submitting the command.

Given that it's what I'm using in [proposals.network](https://proposals.network/), I just wanted to start a thread to ask if "discarded" in this context means "deprecated and someday it won't work anymore, pay attention" or "deprecated, but it's totally fine if you are using it, and it will continue to work, no worries"?

Just replying as I'd like to know the answer to this too!

I use manage neuron in a number of places. Why is it going away?

It’s not.  This thread is about the ‘ID’ optional parameter of the ManageNeuron command.  

For what it’s worth, I use ManageNeuron (through ic-repl) as well for Synapse, CodeGov, and my proposals neuron.

So is this just saying that you're going to need a reference by sub account? Or nonce?

There is a lot more detail in the original [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/questions-about-commands-actions-to-go-through-sns-launch/31378/7) referenced in the OP.  I think someone from DFINITY needs to answer, but when I read the thread I didn't have the impression that the ManageNeuron command is being deprecated.

The question is strictly, solely and only about the parameter `id`.

As a member of the NNS team, I think what @Andre-Popovitch meant is simply that the caller need not populate the `id` field. I am pretty sure he did not mean that NNS governance will stop supporting the `id` field. I believe he simply meant that the `neuron_id_or_subaccount` field is considered more "stylish" than the `id` field.

FWIW, I am not aware of any desire/intention/plan to stop supporting the `id` field. If I'm right, then there is no need to migrate.

Having said this, I don't want to put words in his mouth. I just wanted to give y'all a sooner reply (it will be a few more hours before he wakes up today). Hopefully, he will simply confirm what I've said above :point_up:

Sorry for the confusion everyone!

In response to @skilesare: the `manage_neuron` endpoint is not going anywhere and is not deprecated in any way.

in response to @peterparker / @dfxjesse / @wpb: My intent was “legacy, but it’s totally fine if you are using it, and it will continue to work, no worries”. It is simply that the `neuron_id_or_subaccount` field can do anything the `id` field can do, but the inverse is not true. Therefore if you populate the other two fields, there is never any need to populate `id`. When writing my previous post I was worried that the user I was replying to would be confused about the apparent duplication in functionality, so I was trying to prevent that by preemptively recommending that they ignore `id`. **We certainly have no plans to break backwards compatibility by removing the `id` field or anything like that**.

Sorry again for the confusion!
