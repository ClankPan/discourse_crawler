This weekend I was looking for a date-time library that was simple to use and flexible enough to support my use case.

Heavily inspired by @enzo's chronosphere, I reworked a bit of the library design into https://github.com/byronbecker/motoko-datetime

Right now it's pretty bare-bones, but if any of you want to contribute or add to it please feel free to do so (I'll happily accept PRs).
