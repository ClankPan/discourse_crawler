Hello everyone,

I have built a multiplayer pong game in python where a ckBitcoin is the pong ball, and I would like to put it on the ICP via motoko.
I have no experience coding in motoko.
Can somebody help me do this?
Especially with the multiplayer socket connections.
My code uses localhost so server.py and client.py for player 1 and client.py for player 2 must be run on the same computer.
Hoping with motoko there is a way to run on a free Virtual Private Server for server.py.
All in motoko, yes.

Here is the game code - githubdotcom/MarvinMK-bit/PongGame
Thank you.

I had a little help.

Update: you can play on two different computers if they share a wi-fi connection (copy the Ipv4 address for the Wi-Fi and replace with localhost in both server.py and client.py)
