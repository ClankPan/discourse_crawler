There is an error in the docs.

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/cycles/cycles-ledger#topping-up-a-canister

The docs shows: 

`dfx cycles top-up `AMOUNT` `CANISTER_ID` --network ic`

but must be

`dfx cycles top-up `CANISTER_ID` `AMOUNT`  --network ic`

Thanks for reporting! It'll be fixed soon.
