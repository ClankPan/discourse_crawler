ELNA.ai is planning to launch its SNS DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale soon.

This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the ELNA.ai SNS and ask the founding dev team any questions you may have.

ELNAâ€™s mission is to democratize AI. Being the world's first fully on-chain decentralized generative AI platform, ELNA allows for training of large language models to create AI chat agents that seamlessly integrate on any platform. Being built on the Internet Computer, ELNAâ€™s vector db implementation in canisters allow for scalability and speed of data/code read and retrieval. And its RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) delivers highly contextualized and recent information that can be fact-checked using source citations.


Please refer to the Tokenomics and ELNAâ€™s Whitepaper for further details.

Hi @branbuilder 

it seems that you are using the legacy SNS tokenomics excel sheet. 

Please have a look at this SNS tokenomics wiki [page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration), to get pointers to the most recent SNS init file template and also the SNS tokenomics analyzer.

I would like to have my already staked ICP coin back (unstaking). can you please tell me how to make them unstak?

Hi, this is a different topic so if more assistance is needed please **create a new one to get more support**.

Otherwise, in general you need to click the `Start Dissolving` in the `Locked` Neuron and then wait for the `Dissolve Delay` period - after it passes you will be able to `Disburse` your ICP:

Another option which could be faster (but you might need to give some discount) is to sell your II (includes the locked Neuron(s)) on [https://idgeek.app](https://IDGeek)

Hope this helps.

I thought you just received a developer grant. 

Did you already complete that?

btw...
Don't get me wrong. I am bullish on the ELNA project and vision, and hope it succeeds.

I am just very interested to try out your RAG db running on the IC.

There is no consumer product yet so yeah I agree with you. I think the majority of projects who launched so far have not been ready and it showed with the lack of liquidity as they need the funds to develop. SNS should be used for complete or almost complete products.

Do you have a timeline for the roadmap items? Do you have a timeline for when you want to make an SNS proposal?

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2024-01-03 08:49:31 UTC | #11

Heyy @jennifertran! Do check our roadmap here:
https://www.elna.ai/roadmaps.html 

And we'll be announcing the exact SNS date soon.

Hi @Phasma, we appreciate you, but we believe there's been a gap in understanding here.
ELNA's functionality is already in full bloom, and our current work is geared mainly towards adding more agents to the current list -

Agents: ðŸ”—https://gpdbs-xqaaa-aaaah-adtiq-cai.icp0.io/

as well as releasing specialized agents as products that solve for societal problem statements - the first one in the works being an Ederly Care Companion to help alleviate their loneliness. 


We hope you check the link out and ping us on Discord to be whitelisted and start training ELNA with your data to create agents of your liking and monetize it in the near futureðŸ«¶

Hi, please can you clarify why your agent (Pratheesh) reports that is **developed by `OpenAI` and identifies itself as `ChatGPT`**?

I didn't see such information mentioned in the [Whitepaper](https://docs.elna.live/) but I had just a quick walk through so could have missed it (sorry in such case).
Also note that I'm not AI expert so I'm not making any conclusions.

@branbuilder ,

These experiments from @plsak demonstrate you're running most of your services off-chain, which is to be expected, because the IC does not yet offer the infrastructure to run everything you're providing on-chain. The vector DB might be the exception, and I am very interested to learn more about your approach.

It would be awesome if you could join the [Technical Working Group DeAI](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-deai/24621) meetings. We meet every Thursday, and today we had a great discussion on the most pressing needs to make on chain AI a possibility. 

Your input and sharing of experiences would be very valuable for the community. :pray:

branbuilder | 2024-01-05 15:22:50 UTC | #17

Thanks @bjoernek 
Will check the same and will do the needful

branbuilder | 2024-01-05 19:23:19 UTC | #18

HI @icpp 

We have completed 2 milestones and now are working on the on-chain Vector DB.

Well-wishers like you are our main source of motivation

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2024-01-05 19:12:54 UTC | #19

@icpp 
Your wonderful implementation of "Llama2.c" has been one of our inspirations to make an LLM agent on ICP, so that people can use implementations like the Llama2.c to create LLM agents with the help of RAG and other integration tools running on the ICP chain.

We have completed the initial orchestration and prompt engines, now testing the embedding and vector. Would love to have a second call with you for the integration of Llama2.c to ELNA.

Now there are memory and instruction limits to run larger models but we are confident of running it in future updates.

Llama2.c + ELNA = Chat GPT agents killer.

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2024-01-05 19:16:08 UTC | #20

Hi @jennifertran 

We've completed the orchestration, prompt engine and integration of external LLMs like Chat GPT.

And we are in the process of completing our vector db by next month.

We've been working with multiple clients for various feature add-ons like twitter integration, telegram, chrome extension support etc.

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2024-01-05 19:36:20 UTC | #21

Hi @plsak , 
Apologies for the confusion

ELNA is an LLM agent creation platform, meaning -

We help you create custom autonomous agents, using LLMs like Chat GPT (with prompt engine, vector db for knowledge base, orchestration etc.), which will be running on chain.

We are not building LLMs like GPT but support the integration of LLMs like GPT, Llama2.c etc.

The current bot which you tried is the integration of the OpenAI api, currently there are some limits to run larger models completely on the IC chain.


Hope we've cleared your doubts, please feel free to ask more for any clarity

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2024-01-05 19:22:33 UTC | #22

Will join https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-deai/24621 from the next one, we had briefly popped in for the first one.

WAGMI possible - decentralised AI on ICP

As I have answered @plsak - our vision is to make autonomous LLM agents on IC.

-------------------------

icpp | 2024-01-05 23:42:38 UTC | #23

@branbuilder 
Thank you for that clear explanation of the ELNA architecture. That all makes sense.

Look forward to collaborating further on this.

-------------------------

icpp | 2024-01-06 03:39:32 UTC | #24

@branbuilder ,
I also want to crosslink this message from @jeshli , with a great proposal to introduce optionally charging for query calls in exchange for a big increase in the instructions limit.

I believe this would make it possible for you to run the LLM agents of ELNA on chain.

If it would indeed unblock you, please voice that with DFINITY to put more weight behind this request. The ELNA project is the most visible AI project on the IC, and your support would mean a lot.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-composite-queries/15979/75?u=icpp

EDIT: this proposal would unblock the instructions limit. Still probably blocked by the memory and lack of GPU limits, but perhaps certain, smaller LLM agents could already run with just this instructions limit removed.

Anyone who is blocked by GPU limits should reply to this new thread.  Community feedback is requested for Gen 3 node specs on the topic of GPU.

Hey @branbuilder,

Congratulations on submitting the proposal https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=128102

Based on the proposal, the following canisters will be controlled by the SNS:

```
 #User manegement canister
    - ev7jo-jaaaa-aaaah-adthq-cai
    #RAG canister
    - n4ahg-pqaaa-aaaah-advla-cai
    #frontend canister
    - gpdbs-xqaaa-aaaah-adtiq-cai
    #agent canister
    - gichg-2iaaa-aaaah-adtia-cai
```

However, I can't find the implementation of the RAG canister, and I can't map it very well to the architecture described here: https://docs.elna.ai/elna-whitepaper/technology-architecture. Could you please clarify this further?

It's also not clear to if and how the [Vector DB canister](https://github.com/elna-ai/elna-vector-db) is part of the system.

```
#RAG canister
    - n4ahg-pqaaa-aaaah-advla-cai
```
[/quote]

Sorry for the confusion. There is some miss naming in the git, description and diagram. 

**RAG Canister:** Key to enhancing LLM interaction, this canister orchestrates the prompt engine, linking it with the vector database for efficient data retrieval and processing. It plays a crucial role in the generation and handling of prompts for LLMs.

In git you could find in the name "elnaAi"
https://github.com/elna-ai/ELNA-DApp/tree/main/elnaAi
In the diagram you can see it as RAG canister [Prompt Engine and Agent Orchestration]

>will correct the naming & description.


We plan to have the VectorDB [https://github.com/elna-ai/elna-vector-db] implementation done on the user side, where user have the control .

bjoernek | 2024-02-27 08:39:43 UTC | #28

Question on the token distribution:

The proposal text states
> Proposed Token Distribution Total token supply - 250 Million Reserved for SNS treasury - 50.70% To be distributed by the NNS-run decentralisation swap which includes the Community Fund - 25.00% Allocated to the ELNA founding team which vest over 36 months - 15% Allocated to seed investors which vest over 36 months - 3% Allocated to LBP participants & other airdrops which vest over 12 months - 5.3%

Adding these numbers up gives me 99%. In contrast the whitepaper, includes an additional 1% for airdrops. 

Furthermore, I see from the SNS init file that the 5.3% for LBP is included in the treasury component. Could you please explain why (and when is the distribution of these tokens planned) ?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-02-27 08:46:51 UTC | #29

Further question, as I am trying to understand the technical architecture and the roadmap: 

Which precise components from the technical architecture are
a) not yet implemented or not yet accessible
b) already implemented (on chain)
c) already implemented (off chain)

Would it be fair to summarize that so far access control and the agent metadata is on-chain and implemented (so belonging to category b) ) ?

-------------------------

branbuilder | 2024-02-27 08:53:46 UTC | #30

Hi @bjoernek, 

Additional 1% of the total token supply indeed is reserved for future airdrops. This allocation is designed to enhance community engagement and participation in the Elna ecosystem. The slight oversight in the aggregation of percentages in the proposal text was an error on our part, and we appreciate your understanding in this matter.

As for the 5.3% allocation for Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) participants and other airdrops being included in the SNS treasury component, this decision was made with strategic intent. Including these tokens in the treasury allows us to manage their distribution more effectively and transparently through treasury proposals post-Service Nervous System (SNS) implementation. The distribution of these tokens is planned to occur in a phased manner, following the successful deployment of the SNS and the establishment of a governance framework that facilitates community-driven decisions

With respect to our white-paper > technology architecture
https://docs.elna.ai/elna-whitepaper/technology-architecture

Major components on chain are 
* Vector DB and Similarity Search
* Agent Framework > management of the agent and RAG
* User Interface
* User Management
*Agent Marketplace


Off the chain we have the model inferencing and LLM.
We are working on the on chain inferencing and larger LLMs [waiting for GPU canisters and larger instruction limits]
