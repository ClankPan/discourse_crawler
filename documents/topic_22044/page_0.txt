Should SNS discussions happen on these “developer forums”, or is a better place for them an ICP application, such as OpenChat, DSCVR, or Taggr?

[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]
* These forums should stay the central place for dapp specific (i.e. Modclub, Catalyze, EMC) SNS launch discussions.
* This is a developer forum. Force dapp/application specific SNS launch discussions to move to an ICP application (i.e. OpenChat, DSCVR, Taggr). Lock all posts in violation.
* Strongly encourage the use of an ICP application such as OpenChat, DSCVR, or Taggr as a central forum for a dapp to promote their SNS launch. Do not censor these forums, but instead kindly redirect users to the SNS discussion location hosted on ICP.
* Show results.

Why not just keep them here? SNS is very important and it should be pref in all channels. Not sure what gets the most visibility, maybe twitter?

I personally enjoy writing here vs elsewhere.

Here’s my reasoning for starting this topic. @diegop and @bjoernek, as communications/SNS leads I’m curious what how you/the foundation feel about some of these points.

Sometimes, “SNS launch” topic posts can be heated, attracting a lot of users and attention. 

Pushing (gently or forcefully) promotional SNS discussions away from these forums could produce several positive developments.

1. ICP applications can benefit from the additional user traffic.
2. Decentralize SNS launch away from these forums, and DFINITY being relied onfor SNS launch discusssion, including being “blamed” for moderating too much or too little.
3. These forums are web2, built directly on top of the Discourse service which is based in the United States. The acceptable use policy of the [terms of service](https://meta.discourse.org/tos#heading--acceptable-use) states that any content posted which breaks U.S. law (securities violations?) is grounds for termination, and any [legal disputes](https://meta.discourse.org/tos#heading--disputes) would need to be held in a San Francisco, California courtroom.
4. Refocus these forums to be more about ICP development and governance of the greater IC

@justmythoughts 
I like your idea of hosting discussions about SNS launches on dapps that operate on the IC.  It would be crucial to ensure that the entire community is informed and that voters can easily access relevant information, but this seems manageable.

Enhancing the proposal, it would be beneficial if the dapp could automatically extract and present data & analysis from the proposal to aid the review. For instance, it could show the actual token distribution based on the init file and the subsequent distribution of voting power.

I would also like to hear the opinions of @diegop @Lomesh-dfn1 on this topic.

@justmythoughts right now I couldn't agree more with you on this. The X/Twitter wars are one thing; what grown adults choose to do with their precious time and energy in public forums unrelated to the Internet Computer project is up to them, I don't care.

But these forums are specifically for technical discussion and cooperative support of those who are working on the platform or wanting to be informed and engaged about the platform and it's future development.

SNS discussions are supposed to be focussed on explaining and challenging the technical and operational aspects of the teams and their projects. It is *entirely* possible for everyone to conduct their due diligence and probing questions in a direct but respectful manner, as per the forum rules clearly state.

Frankly I am sick to death of reading post after post in thread upon thread full of undisciplined, unprofessional conduct by people who *say* they are doing so for the greater good, but appear to me to be so involved in their own idealised picture of what the Internet Computer should be for them that they act like spoilt children when they don't get *exactly* the response they want from other people who owe them nothing but a fair hearing.

Please, can we take the sh**-show discussions elsewhere and keep these forums for those who are able and willing to avoid the three A's: accusations, anger and angst.

Technically, only 39% of voters want these forums to be the central place for SNS discussions to occur, while the remaining 61% want SNS discussions to occur elsewhere (either by force or soft encouragement).

kpeacock | 2023-09-07 16:04:38 UTC | #19

My 2 cents are that these SNS discussions
- are unrelated to developer technical questions
- make me kinda sad

and since I don't work on SNS features and have no plans to invest, all they're doing for me is making it harder to discover and respond to technical questions

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-07 16:17:21 UTC | #20

I just want to point out that just over a year ago, participants within this forum begged me to take long form discussion to the forums, as it’s the only place long form critical conversations can take place, without “damaging the reputation of the Internet Computer” or acting as “negative PR”. 

I’ll happily take all of this back to twitter where we can talk about it publicly without being censored - but again, you asked me to come here in the first place.

(No, I’m not making a statement on behalf of everyone, but rather myself. Please don’t try to attach other peoples actions to me. Thanks.)

Dfinity is not equipped to moderate a political or really anything is substance forum. They have proven this time and time again this should be a developer only forum. nuanced discussion should be pushed to Twitter or dscvr

I think SNS and other Governance related discussions should stay on the forum.  

In my opinion, the problem is that moderation rules are not optimized to maintain and enforce civilized conversation.  I don’t know all the configuration options of Discourse, but reputation based privileges and consensus type moderation decisions could probably be improved.  For example, why should someone who has over 50% of their comments hidden due to rule violations be allowed to continue making posts, comments, edits, flags, etc?  Was it really the right decision recently to let moderated content from participants with low level reputation be hidden instead of being deleted?  I think these are fair questions and improvements can be made so it is a more enjoyable and civilized experience for people who want to maintain an intellectually honest and helpful environment..

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-08 01:43:32 UTC | #25

Naa man that’s ridiculous. What is the point of these posts for the SNS? To circle jerk over the technology?

No it’s to get feedback from the community, the people who are going to be investing into the shit coin.

 If you  remove the people who are buying the shit coin for some kind of safe space then you lost the plot.

Crypto is rude if you can’t handle it you need to quit.

Side note, there are emotional intelligence classes that can help you so you learn to speak without sounding so condescending. That is why people are always triggered by your posts.

[/quote]

The answer is pretty simple…to allow the project team to provide information about their project and their SNS structure and for the community to have a chance to ask questions.  All of that can and should be civilized.  There is no need to call it a shit coin or to insinuate people lack emotional intelligence.or to claim people are being condescending.  For the IC to be successful at attracting mainstream adoption, the “crypto is rude” justification needs to be retired.  We can do better.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-09-08 02:23:52 UTC | #27

Don’t these projects want investors? Because if you don’t want anyone to invest this is the perfect attitude.

At icp we rather be poor then take money from people who are rude.

wpb | 2023-09-08 02:26:18 UTC | #28

I don’t understand.  Would you please clarify?  What did I say that makes you think I’m proposing something that won’t attract investors?  It seems to me that having a more civilized place for discussion is more attractive for new and existing investors.  Civilized discussion in no way means that intellectually honest conversations can’t happen.  They absolutely should happen and they have never been moderated on the forum.

You don’t understand crypto culture.

This will not attract investors.

The SNS is a degen tool for gamblers, the people in icp ecosystem that invest in these shit coins are degen gamblers and you are pushing them away. 

You and honestly this ecosystem needs to learn about their target market. 

Either that or try to get regulated and only allow accredited investors. Which is dumb.

That’s fine you can disagree all the way to 0 it’s not sweat off my back.

But there is a reason meme coins have more volume than the entire ICP ecosystem including the ICP coin.

There is a reason a single NFT collection in solana does more volume in a day than has been raised by the SNS.

It’s because those ecosystems embrace crypto culture.


Edit:

Draggins understands crypto which is why people like them.

On the contrary and in support of products being developed in the IC, conversations about SNS should be kept on the forum and not anywhere else. In the fourth quarter of 2023, I still question what dfinity employees are doing on twitter? The spirit and energy of IC enthusiast's need move the conversations and marketing strategies to web3 platforms like DSCVR or district. 
Those complaining need find ways to manage pressure. It would be a long way before AI can be able to moderate conversations fairly. In the meantime, the focus need be adding resources to moderators or hiring modulators on full time clock basis. If you can't survive internet trolls, the market would eat you alive. I do not mean to encourage such behavior, but i think the solution is to deal with the behavior logically by moderating conversations and encouraging civil participation.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-09-08 03:31:51 UTC | #33

Increased moderation is definitely an option, but it’s up to the owners of this forum to decide which message they want to send.

As a developer, I for one did not have any experience with crypto prior to the Internet Computer. I do not identify with the “Degen culture” mentioned in this thread, and originally invested because of the roadmap, vision, and execution both on the cryptography and engineering side of things.

As an investor, I am purely interested in the IC from a technology aspect and have no interest in reading through 50 comments from a back-and-forth argument, reading a post with half its comments hidden, or where the conversation turns personal on these forums.

Compared to the software economy crypto is tiny and insignificant. The IC wins if corporations and developers adopt it for legitimate use cases that provide real, tangible value. VetKeys might actually just be the feature that tips the scales and provides that value. That corporate money is big money on the sidelines, and it will have a hard time taking the IC seriously if they spend a more than a week in this forum.

My two cents to any moderators reading this - don’t try to be people pleasers, people will be unhappy no matter how you moderate. If you provide more post restrictions to these forum (just like any subreddit), developers and your DFINITY team will be happier, and some community members will leave/go elsewhere, even to use ICP apps more often - and that isn’t a bad thing.

There wouldn't be an issue if certain individuals would stop posting like they're on /biz/ memeing with the other chuds, on a forum that's clearly meant for professional discussions. I'm not sure why anyone would think that's a good idea or an effective strategy for changing minds. Hard questions and criticism are great, it's when things start getting personal that the purpose is lost and these threads devolve into pointless shit-flinging.

Anyway, as for the main topic, there are plenty of interesting and useful technical questions and criticisms for SNS projects. Developers should continue to make threads and be active here.

The overwhelming majority of retail investors are not going to come to these forums. They're going to hang out on the various web 2 social media sites, or hopefully at some point migrate over to IC social media. There's ZERO reasons why the official developer forums need to descend into chaos and allow degenerate shitposting, unfounded accusations, and spam. If anything, that will actively HARM the ecosystem because developers won't have quick access to high quality, high density information they need to do their job. They'll have to wade through pages of trash to find that information, and many of them may just decide to move on.

Gives even more of a reason to ban all none technical talk from these forums.

At this point there is so many reasons it’s irresponsible the rules haven’t been changed.

Reasons to make this dev only forum:

- Give developers a place to build.
- Promote icp ecosystem.
- Allow regular degens to enjoy governance process
- Force projects to learn how to manage communities.


Reasons to keep this forum the way it is:

- Safe space
- Be broke

This is a parameter set by the administrators of this forum & has no relevance to this topic.

I believe you are going off topic , attempting to draw correlation to something completely unrelated. I suppose we will let the moderators decide!

In the meantime, you should stop abusing exploits in the edit / flag function & report it within the thread of forum issues you are so concerned about!

Didn’t read all comments so maybe somebody already put out this idea, but wouldn’t it be nice for somebody to build out a specific dapp to discuss SNSes and keep the forum for the technical questions and developer focused?

A black holed canister per SNS discussion, where the content is moderated by the discussion participants? 

Maybe dfinity could put out a grant for this?

True, but who is going to decide to redirect all the traffic to a specific dapp like the ones mentioned?

But take it all with a grain of salt, I didn’t gave the idea a lot of thought
