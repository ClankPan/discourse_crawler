Thank you for reviews!

About technical details - I need to figure out some things:
1) WebRTC (similiar to OpenChat maybe)
2) WebRTC/Websockets hybrid
3) Pure WebSockets
4) REST for failsafe

I'll test multiple solutions thats why I didn't gave datails.

The web2-based version (Python/Django) works on 2 ports: Redis+Daphne/WebSockets for a data sync and classic REST for upload/download blob files (and outside of Redis to not waste a RAM)).
