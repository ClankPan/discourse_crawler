Help! 
Can we verify some user transaction from canister side, done using wallet, say Plug? 
Basically, while building a payment service I want to verify if a transaction was actually successful, and I don't want to do that on client side using transaction response object.
So is there any way we can store transaction data while transfer, and cross verify it with Users successful transactions? (may using API plug use for fetching users transactions).


PS: let me know if I am not clear.

Is there anyway to get Transaction detail using Block height (we get as a response on successful transaction)?

What ledger? Icp? Yes..if you query blocks you will see the transaction in the ledger. You might get a redirect to the archive canister if the block is old.
