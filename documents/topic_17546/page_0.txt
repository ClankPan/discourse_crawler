Hi! I wrote an article about the ICP ledger internals: https://mmapped.blog/posts/13-icp-ledger.html.
Let me know if you think I missed something important or if you'd like me to dive deeper into some of the ICP-ledgerâ€“related topics.

Thanks for all your blog articles, they are incredibly helpful for understanding the IC.

I still don't understand how we ended up in the token standard dilemma that we did. This ledger has been there since day one and works extraordinarily well. We should have done a motoko implementation earlier and had an approvals canister from the jump and maybe we would have avoided it.

Excited to see icrc-1 come to ICP when it is ready!
