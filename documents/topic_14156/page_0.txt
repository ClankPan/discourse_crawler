Hi Everyone

The proposal announced [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/protected-recovery-phrases-proposal-to-upgrade-internet-identity/14153) has been accepted. This means that the protected recovery phrases feature is now available for everyone on https://identity.ic0.app.

Go check it out! :-)

Hi, quick question. Can I protect my "Recovery KEY" too using the protected seed phrase ? Because I see the same option with recovery key.

Hi @ajismyid 

Thanks for the feedback. No, this is unfortunately a front-end bug and it's not possible (the actual call will result in a misleading error message saying the recovery phrase is invalid, which is not true). We will fix this in the coming days.

However, we have kept open the possibility to allow protecting other devices in a future release.
