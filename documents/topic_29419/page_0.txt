SurveyEase is an IC-based survey tool designed to empower users to create, distribute, and analyze unique questionnaires. Our user-friendly interface streamlines the entire survey process, making it accessible to anyone â€“ from academic researchers to business professionals.

Here's what sets SurveyEase apart:

* **Flexibility**: Design surveys with various question types, including multiple-choice, open-ended, rating scales, and more.
* **Customization**: Control survey settings, making questions optional or compulsory based on your needs.
* **Multilingual Support**: Design surveys for a global audience, catering to diverse cultures and languages.
* **Advanced Analytics**: Gain valuable insights from your data with robust analytics tools. Generate reports, visualize results in real time, and track trends.
* **Pre-Built Templates**: Get started quickly with customizable survey templates that cater to various purposes.
* **Dynamic Behavior**: This system utilizes a JSON configuration to orchestrate user flow, manage data collection, and enable offline functionality.
* **Hierarchical Roles**: Manage user access with a role-based system, ensuring data security.
* **Offline Functionality**: Collect data even without an internet connection. Surveys automatically sync upon reconnecting.

## Web3 Advantages 

While many survey tools exist, SurveyEase leverages the power of the Internet Computer (ICP) to offer a unique advantage: enhanced security. Built on a decentralized network, SurveyEase protects user data from breaches and unauthorized access. Additionally, ICP's scaling capabilities ensure our platform can handle a growing user base without compromising performance.



SurveyEase utilizes a modern tech stack for efficient development:

* **Frontend**: Flutter - for building an intuitive and responsive user interface.
* **Backend**: Motoko - a secure smart contract language specifically designed for the Internet Computer.

## The Wizard Flow Engine: Powering Dynamic Surveys

The brain behind this system is the wizard flow controller. It acts as a conductor, orchestrating the user experience based on a JSON payload. This payload defines the sequence of screens, the data collected on each screen, and where that data ultimately resides. The controller leverages this blueprint to dynamically generate the user interface and survey flow. Crucially, the controller also plays a vital role in offline data management. It stores user input in the cache, ensuring a seamless experience even without an internet connection. Once online, the controller synchronizes this cached data with the data canister stored securely in the Internet Computer (IC). This intelligent design not only guarantees a smooth user experience but also ensures the efficient management and transfer of user data.

Here's how the wizard flow engine works step by step:

* **JSON Input**: Users define the survey structure using a user-friendly JSON format.
* **Dynamic UI Generation**: Based on the JSON template, the wizard flow engine generates an intuitive and user-friendly survey interface. It doesn't simply create a form; it constructs a series of interactive screens tailored to the specific survey questions.
* **Question Type Recognition**: The engine intelligently recognizes different question types within the JSON input, such as single-select, multiple-select, freeform text, or signature fields.
* **Robust Functionality**: The wizard flow engine offers a broad range of functionalities:
  * **Image Capture**: Allows users to integrate photo questions into the survey.
  * **Single & Multiple Inputs**: Handles both single-line and multi-line text inputs for flexible responses.
  * **Offline Syncing**: Even without an internet connection, the engine facilitates offline data collection with automatic syncing upon reconnection.

* **Screen Navigation**: Based on user responses and survey logic, the wizard flow directs users to the appropriate next screen.
* **Conditional Logic**: The engine implements conditional logic, allowing users to control whether respondents can proceed to the next screen based on their answers or skip specific sections.

Overall, the wizard flow engine is a cornerstone of SurveyEase, enabling dynamic survey creation and a seamless user experience.

## Internet Computer Superpowers

We leverage two key features of the Internet Computer:

* **Security**: The decentralized architecture of ICP safeguards sensitive user data.
* **Scalability**: ICP's infinite scaling potential ensures SurveyEase can accommodate a vast user base.

## Go-To-Market Strategy 
Our initial target audience includes academic researchers, professors, and students. We'll establish partnerships with universities to gain user feedback and refine the platform. Social media outreach will also be a key component of our marketing strategy.

## Monetization

SurveyEase will operate on a freemium model. The free tier allows the creation of surveys with limited questions and entries. Paid tiers will offer increased capacity based on cycles burned on the Internet Computer. Users will purchase tokens (yet to be priced) to unlock additional features like more questions and entries.

## Status of the Project

SurveyEase is currently in the development stage. We're building the core functionalities and collaborating with professors at our university for initial testing.

## Future Plans

In the next 12 months, we aim to:

* Launch the alpha release, gathering user feedback for further improvements.
* Release a web version of the application to allow users to create their survey using a drag-and-drop tool.
* Secure partnerships with professors and researchers for wider user adoption and diverse perspectives.
* Leverage existing international connections to promote SurveyEase on a global scale.
* Continuously refine the platform based on user feedback and market demands.

We're excited to bring SurveyEase to the world and empower users to conduct secure and insightful surveys. Feel free to ask any questions you might have about our project!
