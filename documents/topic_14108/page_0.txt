TL;DR: [IC internals: XNet protocol](https://mmapped.blog/posts/08-ic-xnet.html)

I'm happy to announce the next post in the "IC internals" series.
A [few people](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/blog-post-ic-internals-orthogonal-persistence/12456/4?u=roman-kashitsyn) wanted to know more about the subnet communication protocol, so here it is!

Warning: the article is not beginner-friendly; it's detailed enough to serve as onboarding material for new engineers in the Message Routing team. Still, I believe the XNet protocol is a marvelous feat of research and engineering that deserves to be covered in detail.
