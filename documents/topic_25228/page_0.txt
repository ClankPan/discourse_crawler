I'm getting an error when trying to deploy locally:
Message byte size 2574554 is larger than the max allowed 2097152.

tried to shrink using ic-wasm but still bigger than the 2mb limitation.
Any way around that (code is c++ based and built using icpp)?

Hi @ktimam,

have you tried gzipping the WASM?

See: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/larger-wasm

That worked. Thanks a lot.
