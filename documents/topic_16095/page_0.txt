Hello.


As the title of topic states, this is a proposal to initiate motion for developing a new feature on NNS front-end UI to allow users to submit proposals directly from the NNS Dapp.

The idea was inspired by Isaac's NNS proposal submission dapp

-> https://nnsproposal.icp.xyz/


**Rationale**: Will allow easy submission of proposal from the front-end dapp. Many proposals have been submitted through Isaac's dapp, which shows that participants need an easier alternative to submit proposals without having to use CLI



Suggestions and ideas are welcome

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-23 07:22:15 UTC | #2

Soon after this, I'd like to see an in-built minimalistic forum for discussing proposals within the NNS Dapp.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-23 07:24:26 UTC | #3

Without the terms and conditions of this forum please and thanks.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-23 07:25:25 UTC | #4

Obviously, free-speech is important. Give users a feature to hide replies if they don't wanna see a reply or get offended by it.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-23 07:32:25 UTC | #5

That's it. The ability to block or hide a user if they feel drawn as well. Hopefully, everyone would remain at the very least respectful when *actually* discussing a NNS proposal. We don't all have to be best friends, but business is business. I don't support this forum as a way to engage in governance topics anymore. Essentially, it is saying any feedback comments absolutely anything you say, post, create, or share is then owned by the foundation. That means the foundation owns every idea, proposal, almost the entire NNS by this standards. I think this could/ should be discussed more at the very least. It *could* be an issue.

That's also the reason I don't bother discussing anything here. No offense, this is an echo chamber. Only good thing to come out of this forum IMO is devs building and sharing tools.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-23 07:38:08 UTC | #7

That's it. But even those tools and devs building/ sharing ideas should be careful sharing any of their ideas on this forum. Even in private messages the foundation would then outright own any proprietary rights to your product. If you say it on here it is no longer yours but is the foundations to choose what they want to do. If you share or give the wrong idea out, that idea is now the foundations and not yours and you agree to this by even say making this post, or my commenting and leaving this feedback lmao It's just a useless echochamber. I thought it would be a useful way to engage with developers and the wider serious staking community and what I got was an ironic facade and unbelievable arrogance and feelings of superiority

Hey, well done.  This is actually a useful post from you @CatPirate.

I agree with your suggestion and I think we have all wanted this for a long time.  The DFINITY answer is likely to be that they have prioritized SNS or something like that, so I'm doubtful a proposal will move the needle on implementation.  However, it has never been brought to the formal proposal stage, so maybe that is something worthwhile.

I think the NNS dApp implementation should include several stages.  The first is initial proposal with requirement to deliberate for a min time period (e.g. 7 days).  Then give the proposer an opportunity to revise the proposal into the final details before voting begins.

Using a staged approach, we could also implement a "table the proposal" feature that can be used as a spam filter.  If someone moves to table the proposal during deliberation, then a vote occurs and it will not move forward if the motion to table the proposal is approved.

There could also be a crowdfund requirement before the formal proposal is submitted such that each proposal is supported by more than one person.

Then I would say DFINITY needs to do a better job with prioritization.

For starters, a minimalistic submission feature is enough IMO

We should just write memes and post them on Twitter because it's easier.  :rofl:

Seriously though, @jsull9 has some good points...

My personal take is that they use standard T&C language so DFINITY can take down anything someone posts that reasonable people would agree should be removed and to protect whatever intellectual property rights they legally own.  I've seen a lot of questionable stuff posted on the forum that has stayed up.  I think the actual implementation of the rules is reasonably fair.  Nonetheless, I still support the idea of this original post that submitting proposals should be built into the NNS dApp and I would assume that means a different set of T&C would apply, if any.  

Damn it, I just echoed what @CatPirate said to start this forum topic.  Where is my original thought?  Here comes the self writing meme... :writing_hand:

https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/what-is-an-echo-chamber/1/ 

This is what an Echo chamber is @wpb just in case you did not know...


Also, again I'd like to say I do not use twitter, telegram, fb, snap whatever, i don't tik the tok 

I use WEB 3 products hosted on the IC more specifically Distrikt because the Distrikt team is the only one who actually takes time to get to know their investors and users. I do not want to use a censored forum. 

I suggested we make a separate forum to discuss governance. NOT poke fun at people about memes and what have you (ahem @wpb) I will not use DSCVR to do this. 

We need a forum where our ideas stay ours, our data stays ours, we control the proprietary rights to our own ideas and thoughts. Nothing we say or do that gets put into the NNS right now is ours. EVERYTHING is the foundations. You don't own anything. Kinda feel like maybe this is why greyscale turned the ICP token down... Do we not own anything we build or develop on the IC? is it all just the foundations by legality? If so, how does this mean we own anything even on projects hosted on the IC? 

Then it makes sense why some continue to think the foundation is a sham. It's like okay, we own everything UNLESS we say it here, develop it off grant funding, So, really we might not own *anything* all of your hardwork was work done for free and then is now a product of the foundation. We all have been giving away free labor to the foundation (by these definitions). If you want a true image of what the community wants you have to let them actually own their ideas. I was all for sharing my ideas personally, then I spent hours reading the fine print and I see why people in the space refuse to share their opinions or even give suggestions. Why would anyone want to continue to give suggestions like @wpb mentions, when if they do so they no longer are the ones who own the idea. It's exploitation with no compensation.

And the foundation has been nothing but unappreciative and has ignored other builders. Important to note that ICPMN  ( now synapse ) has three employees of DFINITY as their voting members. Surely nothing to see here folks, just very very very decentralized governance lmao. If you would just go to DFINITY's twitter, its filled with ICPMN members circle-jerking.

I deleted Twitter and ONLY use Distrikt, because well the whole point of making these beautiful creations is to LEAVE POINTLESS TROLL FARMS LIKE TWITTER and use the applications designed and hosted on the IC/ web 3. Therefore, I have to turn that suggestion down. I 100% refuse to join twitter among many others and give them my data. It kinda doesn't make sense to me why everyone has the ability to leave and take control over their data like the IC's mission statement, but because they are rewarded by a following or base they continue to exploit themselves. Why? How can we develop projects then not even actively use them ourselves but ONLY continue to use and force users to use web 2 platforms in order to stay up to date. How can no one else see this as a *huge* issue? 

I will not give my upmost attention to the forum or any of my heart filled suggestions until I know they are if anything owned by the community and not the foundation. THIS is where I agree transparency within the foundation is going to help foster/ facilitate the growth of the project. However, it is also where I see you will only create echo chambers until you create a web 3 product where there is no "cloud fare" built 100% on chain like Distrikt. Then give the users what they want and what the who flipping mission statement of Dfinity is. Give us our flipping rights back to our own data, content, ideas, thoughts, and opinions. AND STOP trying to force us to use the same products you want us to leave.

In case you forgot my suggestions on the tokenomics Sh#tshow you and dfinity created, I could remind you again. In fact, I'd be happy to spend my whole day tomorrow writing a big summary of it.


"It all started when NNS participants began siphoning the rewards from unaware users...." would be something like this.



Somehow clicking yes or no mindlessly on a proposal made these people eligible to siphon rewards

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-23 19:30:08 UTC | #21

Not asking you to use Twitter. I use distrikt as well. Its the chicken and the egg problem everywhere on-chain. Point being twitter provides a medium to share about ic to onboard web2 peeps.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-23 19:37:02 UTC | #22

my opinion is that the Medium is the message. In this case then the medium would be twitter and the message would be use twitter to discuss the IC which is ironic. I want the medium to be hosted on-chain so the message is "stay on-chain"

-------------------------

vavram | 2022-10-23 19:41:02 UTC | #23

Completely agree, this should be a top priority at DFINITY and for anyone invested in the Internet Computer who wants to move forwards towards decentralization.

[/quote]

That’s exactly why I suggested building a forum within NNS dapps. In fact, this entire forum could be built within NNS. Gmail or github login leveraging NFID with a specific disclaimer could be implemented to onboard “beginners”, however not recommended to let them create neuron with this.




Forum is public so wouldn’t need authentication to read. If its too much for nns subnet, use other subnets for forum, secured with random providers across the globe. NNS could add dfinity members or anyone else as moderators to keep spam posts away.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-23 20:02:01 UTC | #25

Would you entertain the idea of creating an in depth proposal for the foundation and developers to read and begin considering? This might help facilitate the macro level change *we* want

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-23 21:14:26 UTC | #26

I will begin drafting a proposal but please don’t expect it to be fancy.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-10-23 23:47:27 UTC | #27

I don’t think we can do proposals asking dfinity to build entire software projects. You’re talking about an entire team of people. 


I think we would be better off crowd funding a forum out of @aiv ‘s project than trying to disrupt dfinity’s road map.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-24 00:46:04 UTC | #28

I know for a fact that it would only take DFINITY like 4-10 man hours to implement proposals through the NNS dapp for Motion and Known Neuron proposal types. Considering the small amount of work, I see no reason why they couldn't quickly add this along with the next batch of NNS updates.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-10-24 00:53:11 UTC | #29

Naa I’m talking about all the other features. Forum and stuff

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-24 01:10:41 UTC | #30

I’ve been waiting for a year for manage neuron to be put back and it was originally there. It is two characters that need to be added(a number and a comma in an array). I don’t think the amount of work required has anything to do with actual time to implementation (other than being the floor for possible implementation).

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-24 01:37:00 UTC | #31

Lol, we could make a bounty to fork the NNS app and add these features.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-10-24 02:05:22 UTC | #32

I thinks dscvr is adding ability to vote maybe they can add ability to create proposals too.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-24 09:15:08 UTC | #33

taggr.top and openchat already have bots for this.

There is a dscvr portal with NNS slug already https://dscvr.one/p/nns, just no one uses it.

Manu | 2022-10-24 12:04:24 UTC | #34

Nice idea @CatPirate! Do you think it has to be the NNS dapp? It could also be a separate canister that allows you to do this. I believe that via hotkey access to neurons, a canister could submit proposals on behalf of your neurons staked in the NNS dapp.

-------------------------

lucianc_11 | 2022-10-24 13:49:15 UTC | #35

This is much needed, especially the feature to discuss proposals directly via the NNS.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-24 17:39:16 UTC | #36

Dont wanna burden NNS subnet, but at the same time want to see forum within NNS dapp front end, one can directly create proposal and people could discuss on the submitted proposal as well.


Goal is to onboard users via public forum - with simple guides n tutorials within NNS front-end. There are many possibilities with this. For starters we can just let users submit proposals via NNS( let neuron holders comment if possible on the proposal).


Maybe leverage open chat’s existing architecture and blend it with current forum’s UI. Once it gets there we can enable tipping feature for incentivizing

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-10-24 18:52:19 UTC | #37

This would be ideal. We really need to get the NNS autonomous and by consequence as complete as possible : the governance must start and end into the NNS. A call to a forum relying on the WEB 2 is unreadable for newcomers. This would bring consistency to the ICP’s goal : be the foundation of the web. From this perspective, relying on a forum outside of the NNS and based on the web 2 is inconsistent or at least can be perceived as inconsistent : eventually, it implies that ICP is based on the Web 2. At least marketingly and ideologically, it is problematic. We need to gather the whole governance (votes and debates) there.

As soon as we have to explain to newcomers : « the pre proposals and the debates are elsewhere », we lose something.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2022-10-26 06:44:09 UTC | #38

If you have time, why don't you create this feature? Would be very cool to see an outside contribution to the NNS Dapp and I'm confident we would get funding for the 10 man hours to compensate you.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-26 12:27:27 UTC | #39

I would love to, except I'd need to learn Rust first. I made the NNS Proposal Dapp in Motoko, but the official NNS dapp is in Rust (and way more complex).

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2022-10-26 12:42:21 UTC | #40

Oh I thought this only needs work on the frontend

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-26 13:16:30 UTC | #41

I'd have to check to be sure, but I think the NNS front end is separated from the actual NNS canister, and as such there would be a little back end work setting up calls between the canisters.

However, there's technically nothing stopping anyone from simply forking the entire NNS dapp, and adding whatever features are needed. The issue there is that now a trusted party would be in control of that fork instead of DFINITY.... Unless it transferred control over to an SNS...

Next year maybe someone will made an SNS NNS dapp? That's a lot of fun acronyms!

DFINITY is the major contributor to IC.


I don't think this simple dapp would cost a lot of their resources. We need a feature to submit proposals via NNS, not a killer dapp.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-10-26 14:05:44 UTC | #46

Hey everybody! We (NNS-dapp team member here) have it in our backlog but to be honest, never gave it any priority sofar notably because this year e.g. rewriting the dapp in svelte from scratch and other projects like Sns had prio. 

I'll share with the foundation and team that it would be a welcomed feature. Go on with the discussion and proposal, it's a cool idea :+1:

-------------------------

bitdivine | 2022-10-28 14:58:22 UTC | #47

Regarding discussing posts, it would be cool if the NNS team didn't have to invent its own forum.  Can't we link to or embed some existing on-chain forum?
