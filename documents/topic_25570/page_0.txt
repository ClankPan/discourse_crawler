Yesterday, I received some answers regarding how to query the memory ([thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/getting-heap-and-stable-size/25533/3?u=peterparker)). I am now comparing two approaches, and I am getting different values.

When I deploy a canister and install its wasm, I obtain different values when comparing `canister_status` and `memory_size`:

Through `canister_status`, I get a `memory_size` of **30.02 MB**, while `core::arch::wasm32::memory_size(0)` returns 28 (approximately **1.75 MB**) if I'm not mistaken.

I assume these two numbers indicate different things, but what am I missing?

Somehow give a brand new canster with only few heap data, I naively assumed that both would indicate the same size.

The size difference oddly looks similar to the same difference in my today's thread about stable structure. Therefore, I would guess this is for the same reason, and I can close this thread in favor of the other: [https://forum.dfinity.org/t/stable-memory-consumed-even-if-not-used/25599/2?u=peterparker](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/stable-memory-consumed-even-if-not-used/25599/2?u=peterparker)
