It’s a sad that Dfinity does not recognize the importance of having native, mainstream stablecoin integration with ICP. Please, no comments on how it will be solved with CK tokens, since that will never be as seamless as native support.

Is there any other reason ICP lacks native USDC integration besides Dfinity's unwillingness to implement it? Since USDC integration also requires payment to Circle, if Dfinity is unwilling to fund it, I'm pretty sure the ICP community could raise the necessary funds for it.

Blockchains with native USDC support.

maybe theres some regulartory issues or something were not seeing being that icp is different than every other project just implementing a stable coin may cause some issues not really sure though just throwing possibilities out there.

-------------------------

I very much agree with the idea of having a native stablecoin in the ICP ecosystem. There may be many specific implementation methods, such as the USDC you mentioned, which is issued by Circle and uses US dollars or dollar-denominated assets as pledge assets.

My point of view is to use mainstream tokens with high consensus and strong liquidity as collateral, and use the US dollar price as the benchmark to issue native stablecoin in the ICP ecosystem.

Compared with using US dollars as collateral and using BTC as collateral, there are pros and cons. The former can quickly gain user recognition, while the latter is more friendly to the future - the "native" we mentioned is not only for the ICP ecosystem, Also targeting the crypto world.

Jonathan | 2024-03-25 05:18:06 UTC | #8

I'm thinking that it will take resources away from the development of the ecosystem, which seems designed to stand on it's own merit.

Adopting a coin based upon a particular currency... doesn't this essentially adopt that currency?

Personally I use USDT more than USDC. 

Where I do agree with you is that I doubt people would adopt ckUSDC/ckUSDT right away even if it was integrated on exchanges. I think it would come gradually as people discover the ICP ecosystem and I think having native USDC/USDT support would help with that.

This question has been raised for almost three years, and can I surmise that a large number of the community's powerful neurons do not want to advance the progress of native stablecoins? Otherwise, why has it been ignored for so long?

-------------------------

BasedGiant | 2024-03-25 21:07:52 UTC | #13

One of the main reasons we should have USDC and USDT native is that it gives the chain more credibility.

I'm mega bullish on ICP, but the lack of native USDC and USDT makes us look like Neanderthals.

Even Flow has native USDC, this is hilarious. I feel like a second tier citizen of the blockchain world.

**This is our personal opinion:**
Integrating with stablecoin in an emotional way can slow down the development of the ecosystem.
We have no doubt that the existence of stablecoin can bring a new wave of liquidity, but emotional actions in this regard undoubtedly create danger for the society. We believe that this merger should be done at the right time. This integration should be done in the most correct way. (like ckBTC and ckETH)

After this style of action, ecosystem projects create dollar pools. The wave of demand can cause the price of ICP to grow exponentially.. Note, the astronomical prices for ICP will slow down the development of new projects, because the cost of development will be heavy.

Fun fact. In Denver last month I stumbled out of some golf rave bar with a bunch of ICP folks and we walk waaaay to far through the streets of Denver. A few party lines are way too long. We keep walking. Eventually, we give up and I head to my hotel. Deciding I'm not quite done and that there is a bar I went to the year previous just a block from my hotel that has some good fancy cocktails, I decided that since I've walked about 8 miles and ridden an electric scooter about 18 miles in the almost freezing weather that day, that it is a treat yourself night and I head to the bar.  The place is packed.  A few people are waiting for a spot and eventually, they tell me and this random guy to follow them and take us to the bar and sit us right next to each other.

It's only a bit awkward.

"So...ugh...you here for the conference....."  ...and low and behold, not only was he here for the conference but he worked in BizDev for Circle.  We had a lovely chat and I can guarantee you that no one is sitting around ignoring USDC on the IC.  They are excited to see how the bridged USDC works out long-term native integration is a possibility.

It may actually be harder to do on the IC because when you do a native implementation there is a metric fuck ton of regulatory and non-cryptoy stuff that has to be done so that Circle doesn't run afoul of KYC/AML/OFAC issues.  On anon networks you can kind of ignore it, but since the IC runs on mostly known hardware owned by subpoena people it might 13x the amount of work that has to be done.

I support a native stable coin. This may take some time. In the meantime I would prefer a bridge to ETH L2s like Base, Arbitrum or Optimism as Jordan as suggested before. ckUSDC are still going to be expensive to send to and from the IC since the transactions have to touch the ethereum network.

-------------------------

BANG | 2024-03-26 00:45:54 UTC | #18

I am highly curious to know why on each point? I myself voted yes for reason being that developers have an additional on ramp for those who are new to the tech but familiar with USDC. Usually, that is the on/off ramp for most. I look forward to Gold being the stable coin, until then, I dont believe it could hurt? Again, I am here to learn.

I support a native stable coin.

Without it, I and many other developers need to deposit fiat in CEX (or something like that) first, then exchange it to ICP, and then transfer ICP to other wallets, then convert ICP to cycles or other tokens.

It's not an enjoyable experience to hold and use ICP tokens, and might block many web2 users to get in.

Therefore, I believe that native stable coin is necessary to ICP ecosystem.

Here are some thoughts regarding this topic:
Here's Bitcoin Suisse's CHF Stablecoin👇
[https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/cryptofranc](https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/cryptofranc)
So, as the foundation is in Switzerland, how about considering bringing a CHF stablecoin like Bitcoin Suisse has?
I am really not aware on what are the barriers and so on, but I think this is also another good approach to fixing this issue.
As we all know, CHF has a good reputation, so this can also facilitate bringing mass adoption into the IC.
I hope to hear comments from others as well in this regard.
Thanks.

-------------------------

Bing | 2024-03-26 14:37:16 UTC | #24

Similar to USDT, XCHF is also a stablecoin anchored to fiat currency, which is mainstream at the current market stage. This is also a realistic choice, and there is no problem in the short to medium term.

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-04-22 00:42:03 UTC | #25

I am here due to having lost confidence in Cardano. And the lack of a worthwhile stablecoin was something that influenced my decision. The long-time understanding was that Charles Hoskinson didn’t want native usdc because he didn’t want to yield that much control over to a third party. So then I learn more about icp and, in particular, ckbtc and cketh. Then to learn that usdc may be implemented via the same method. And this sounds like the best of both worlds. They’re going to have usdc but not lose control of their blockchain and/or defi. No other blockchain has this because no other blockchain can. I’m impressed so far. How is native usdc that much more of an advantage?

-------------------------

Onadrac | 2024-04-22 00:53:43 UTC | #27

I wasn’t aware that ckusdc would be that impractical for overall use. Hopefully they make a decision that works for everyone.

-------------------------

Bing | 2024-04-22 15:41:21 UTC | #28

The business path of ckusdc on ICP is too long and cannot achieve effective inter-chain risk isolation.
  This is the reason why we are not optimistic about token mapping of infrastructure types other than public chain gas.

[/quote]

The main advantage is that it is issued by an official provider and does not depend on any other chain. What happens if there is the most liquidity in ckUSDC and something goes terribly wrong with Ethereum? It's not likely, but it can happen.

The fact is that among stablecoins, USDC is considered the most regulated one. If so many chains have a native implementation, it's a major disadvantage for ICP not to have it. How many developers are also choosing chains based on the stablecoin implementations they support? In my opinion, this should have been done 2 years ago.

-------------------------

Agnostic | 2024-04-29 17:33:33 UTC | #31

"Does not depend on any other chain"

Haven't people raised similar issues about having native Bitcoin instead of ckBTC?  Like this point, for example...

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-bitcoin/6147/543?u=agnostic


And that point was responded to by **Timo** here:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-bitcoin/6147/528?u=agnostic
> **Saying to want to hold Bitcoin “directly, not ckBTC” does not make sense. It it isn’t possible. Bitcoin will be held by a canister and all we can have is a key that controls the entire canister or at least some assets in the canister. Because of this indirection we call them “ckBTC” and not “BTC”. But the indirection will always be there.**

What would matter most is that ckUSDC is exactly as USDC in terms of value while leveraging the benefits of the ICP's infrastructure (faster transactions, cheaper, etc).  Although, maybe it would look better and less confusing (unless you read up on it, which perhaps lots won't do) to the general public to get rid of the "ck" where it shows your token balances in the NNS.

Agnostic | 2024-05-03 00:15:37 UTC | #32

Just found an updated post from that same poster regarding ckUSDC...now not a good idea...

[quote="dfisher, post:17, topic:22819"]
Thanks @manu. I would strongly suggest rolling out ckUSDC with ckETH in Q4 if that’s possible.
[/quote]

And Timo now says...
[quote="timo, post:20, topic:22819"]
You can’t wrap centrally issued tokens in this way like you can with BTC, ETH, etc. The problem is the issuer can freeze the whole pool and they will if there is one transaction going on that they don’t like, making all ckUSDC worthless even if they aren’t related to that transaction. Central issuers must issue natively on ICP.

Ever notice how "circle" and "cycle" sound similar?

Well, "cycle" is already a native, stable currency on the ICP.

I voted No because adding some unnecessary organizational relationship is quite antithetical to the idea of decentralization here.

(As a bonus, unlike USD, which will be forever loosing value because of, well, the powers that be, "cycles" will have a well-defined utility, forever.  Now that's a stable coin!)

My views differ notably. For instance, a vast number of cycles are currently in circulation, often available at significant discounts. This makes them a poor choice for maintaining peg value. The primary reason is the foundation's practice of distributing cycles for free to developers; a situation expected to shift once most circulating cycles are consumed by dApps.

Before even considering anything else related to cycles, it's crucial to implement tracking on the dashboard for clear visibility of their circulation.

Regarding USDC, the ICP protocol should support any type of enterprise adoption. Ultimately, the decision to use it rests with users. The absence of a globally recognized stablecoin, natively integrated across top blockchains, is a significant strategic misstep.

Talking about 'unnecessary organizational relationships' is somewhat moot in the context of ICP, since the main point is to ensure compliance with whatever comes next. The blockchain space is about to change drastically over the next few (months) years due to various new rules and regulations. Chains that are unable to comply will likely fade away.

The points that @skilesare raises at the end of his story seem like the best reasons to stop considering this seriously.

More philosophically (my additional point, to add to the better points already raised above by @skilesare):

We are comparing two ways to store value and circulate it:
ICP cycles and the US dollar.

Whatever complaints you have about cycles being printed "for free" or not otherwise having enough accounting for it to be "stable" applies even more so to the US dollar.  The US dollar is among the worst choices for "maintaining peg value" when you actually consider the value of assets, not just "money".

Cycles will always be a valuable asset.  If that were not true, the entire ICP system would fall down and fail, and it isn't doing that.

Watch the US dollar fall down and fail.  It's already happening as we write.

[quote="matthew, post:35, topic:28821"]

[/quote]

Don't get me wrong the free cycles were (and still are) necessary to bootstrap new developers, and many of these cycles are in circulation, available at significant discounts. Therefore, they are **currently** not a good choice if being pegged is important. Once the ecosystem has matured to the point where there is no need to subsidize new developers with free cycles, it could serve as the best solution for stable coin, maintaining the peg built into the protocol itself.

Would I prefer a decentralized, algorithmic, globally accepted stablecoin over USDC? Definitely, and we can switch as soon as one is available. Until then, not having a native USDC stablecoin that is available on other chains is not a viable path if global adoption is something the ecosystem cares about.

-------------------------

ishaaqziyan | 2024-05-04 16:30:03 UTC | #37

Here are two options, which I found after thorough research, which seems quite viable:
1)There is a project named Ondo Finance who has enabled native USD at SUI, Mantle and many other projects, which is known as USDY.
Maybe utilize this approach for the time being should be good, IMO.
https://ondo.finance/usdy
Already have 200milish TVL so liquidity should not be a problem.

2) First Digital Labs, hosting FDUSD, which is now the stablecoin used by Binance, after Paxos left the initial partnership.
Maybe reaching out to them should also be a good resolution.

As the main person that refills the faucet I can confidently say that the faucet does not mint _that_ many cycles. Best guess (but still only a guess): Back when 1 ICP converted to less than 3 trillion cycles the faucet probably had an impact, although even back then I would have argued that it wasn't responsible for more than a few percent of the cycles surplus. And now with the recent increase in conversion rate the faucet did not hand out even remotely enough cycles to keep the discount on DEXes (compared to minting) this stable.
