**I have a technical question - where I need technical help.**

We are building a Crowdfunding marketplace, where users log in with "Internet Identity" wallet.

1. When a User has logged in via Internet Identity. (https://nns.ic0.app).

2. Our platform would like to be verified - with the user's permission - IF they are a member of the "8-year gang". (YES/NO).
The same question is explained in another way: To verify yes/no, when a user logs in via Internet Identity - if the user is staking ICP for 8 years and with Dissolve Delay. 

3. Additional information. I did notice that when I log in with Internet Identity and when I am staking, I have Stalking Neuron ID: - with the ICP Staking. Maybe we can check if the "Internet Identity" has a "staking Neuron ID?

Please let us know how we can technically verify if a user is part of the 8-year gang.

Hello there,

FYI - The Internet Identity principal is unique to each domain. Therefore, an II principal connected to your site will be different from the II principal using the same passkey connected to the NNS dapp. It already would be challenging to verify the owner of an II principal that was generated on the NNS dapp. 

Also, only controllers/owners of a neuron can see the list of the neurons that they created. Therefore, there is not a way for you given any principal see the list of neurons that they own.

You can know if a neuron is part of the "8 year gang" or has a dissolve delay of 8 years by calling and passing in the neuron ID in the `get_neuron_info` function in the [Governance Canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai).
