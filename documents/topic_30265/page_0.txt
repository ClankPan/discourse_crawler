Is it or would it be possible to have an SNS that acts like an NNS allowing things like sub SNS's "SSNS"?

I would like to build a community dapp for Multiple Occupancy land holders and allow each MO to have it's own "SSNS" with the main hub being the SNS.
Thanks!

Based on your explanation you are trying to achieve some kind of decentralized governance for lands owned by multiple land owners, and i think for that you can create a governance canister in which land owners have the ability of voting and proposal creation and etc.. . once you implement that canister you can create an SNS to handover the control of that governance canister to the community.

Thanks for the reply!

Kind of yes, but actually I would like to give each MO the ability to create and govern different stakes on there respective MO but also have a main hub for all MO's. 

For example each occupant could stake or propose things that generate value for there MO (veggie garden, orchards or construction etc.) .
