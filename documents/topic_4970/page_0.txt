**Fix/Remove highlighted statement**
*It is suggested elsewhere a user will eventually be able to transfer cycles and once there is sufficient demand for computation theoretically they should act as a stable-coin... I believe I saw cycles being transferred in an open chat demo (not sure if that feature is still being pursued or not)*

**Fix this sentence**
*new projects **create** a*

**fix this sentence**
*should probably say, "... in a separate terminal or the background", or something along the lines.*

**Remove section 3 from "Non-goals"**
*as it's now an advertised goal*
... actually, I guess it's a bit cloudy as this is in the Motoko SDK section not ICP as a whole.

**Add semicolon to end for consistency with references later in this section**

*"A substitution [of?] semantics?"*

*A bit confusing as worded, should maybe read, "For example, nesting your program within one you do not trust cannot arbitrarily re-associate your variable occurrences with different meanings."*

parenthesis should be after word, *"...value (result)"*

"Numbers." should be a heading

**seem to mix up caller and callee at the 2nd part of this paragraph**

... shared **function** *(drop s)*

The documentation is open source, if you feel comfortable using GitHub you can fork it and implement the changes yourself. Makes you a contributor to the IC and saves some overhead ðŸ˜Ž

You sure this specific documentation for Motoko is there?

... cannot find it.

You are totally right, this should be the correct one

I believe there may have been a fly on the wall of this post as Motoko was open-sourced that same day.

... they have also been very responsive to pull requests.
