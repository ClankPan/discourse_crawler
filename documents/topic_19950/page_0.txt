I will probably try this in the morning, but curious if you can call install_code from a canister on that very same canister.

If possible this would be a more elegant way to overcome the Wasm binary limit when using an intermediate canister to deploy, rather than spinning up a new canister.

So is this possible?

I can confirm that this works, though it seems that the management_canister cross-canister call will not return properly, because by the time the callback needs to be called the binary has been swapped out:

Here's the error on the call:

```

call_on_cleanup also failed:
