Greetings,

Iâ€™ve created a new II in the new website https://identity.internetcomputer.org/

However, this new II does not work with any dapp, it only works with the NNS new website.

Will this new II eventually work? is it safe?

Identities are by default limited to the domain, most dapps use https://identity.ic0.app.

You can make the identity available at this other domain by using adding a passkey:

- Go to https://identity.internetcomputer.org
- Login and click "Add passkey"
- Copy the url below the passcode
- Change the domain in this url to https://identity.ic0.app and navigate to it.
- Follow instructions

You can alternatively use the recovery phrase from https://identity.internetcomputer.org on https://identity.ic0.app which has the same result.

Some dapps like Juno have a link to authenticate with the older II domain (https://identity.ic0.app). Most dapps only use the older II domain.
