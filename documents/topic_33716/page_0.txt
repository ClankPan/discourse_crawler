This is a small update about public neurons. In the [motion proposal for Public & Private Neurons](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130832), it says that the subaccount of a public neuron will be redacted (when the neuron is being read by an unprivileged principal). Whereas, DFINITY now thinks it is best not to redact this field, because it can be inferred fairly easily.

It seems like exposing subaccount would not be controversial, especially, since it favors transparency. If there are no objections, exposing subaccount will be implemented.

I have no issue with this proposed change.  It seems reasonable to me.
