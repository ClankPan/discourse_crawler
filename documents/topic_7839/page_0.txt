Is there an interface documentation for the ledger canister (with its canister ID and stuff)? Also, do I need the .did file for the ledger canister in by .dfx directory, or do I just need to send messages to the canister itself?

You can find its canister id and explore the interface here if it helps:
[Canlista: nns-ledger/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/listing/nns-ledger-10244/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai)

To copy the .did click “view .did file” there, you don’t need this to call the canister, but it can be used by tools like didc to decode the responses.

A forwarding canister for the protobuf interface is here too: [Canlista: ledger-candid](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/listing/ledger-candid-10278) and ic.rocks also has the protobuf endpoints: https://ic.rocks/principal/ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai

Re docs I think only those for getting started with the Rosetta api are up at the moment:
[https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/integration/ledger-quick-start.html#_ledger_canister_overview](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/integration/ledger-quick-start.html#_ledger_canister_overview)

If you’re just looking to interact with the ledger from dfx there is a dfx ledger command, which is well documented here: [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference/dfx-ledger.html](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/cli-reference/dfx-ledger.html)

Thanks, this looks right! Is there a way to get transaction history for a particular address? Like all transfers to/from an account?
