**Rune Specific Internet Canisters (RSIC)**

**RSIC: A PEER-TO-PEER RUNE ALLOCATION SYSTEM**

This is the first rune on Internet Computer Protocol.

Read the rules of the game below if you choose to play.

**SUPPLY CHAIN:**

RSIC Distribution Centers    - RSIC availability

RSIC Controller      - RSIC & rune distribution

RSIC Factory (Rune Specific Internet Canisters)  - Purpose: mine runes.

RSIC Booster Factory  - Boost miners

Rune Foundry. Purpose: generate runes.  - Rune Token Canister

**SITUATION:**

A technological arms race has begun. 6,000 cutting-edge RSICs, manufactured in our Factory, are being availed from our Distribution Centers to the ICP community as a Free mint. The RSICs are designed for the sole purpose of securing a bag of runes. These runes will be generated, in our Foundry, after the runes protocol launches on bitcoin or at the 840,000 Block.

**RULES OF THE GAME:**

1. All RSICs are NFTs. 6,000 were manufactured in total. Our factory and distribution centers have since mysteriously exploded.

2. All RSICs are being availed to the ICP community as Free mint.

3. RSIC holders have 3 choices: (1) mine runes. (2) sell RSICs on market. (3) fade.

4. RSICs must be activated before they start mining. To activate your RSIC in the Rune Distribution Centers decentralised application.

5. Every bitcoin block, runes will be allocated to the address holding activated RSIC(s). Until the supply is fully allocated.

6. Rune allocations stack (more RSICs = more runes). There is no limit on the number of RSICs per address.

7. There are 4 types of rune allocation: flat, random, boosted, and p-halving.

8. RSICs holders till token generation event will be rewarded with runes.

9. 7% of RSICs are reserved for the game designers.

10.3% of RSICs are reserved for the game promoters & influencers on FCFS basis.

**RUNE ALLOCATION TYPES & DISTRIBUTION:**

1. FLAT (up to 30% of fully diluted rune supply): a flat reward of 6 runes per bitcoin block per active RSIC.

2. BOOSTED (up to 30% of fully diluted rune supply): a single boost will be available to all RSICs. The instructions will be published after 24 hours of all RSICs minted.

3. RANDOM (25% baseline + residual runes from flat and boosted): an additional reward per block allocated via random hash alignment. If your RSICs type code aligns with the last digit of a given blockhash, your RSIC mines 336 runes in that block. All RSICs indicate hash alignment with current block with a visual cue (hint: orange).

4. POST-HALVING: 5 allocations (5% + 4% + 3% + 2% + 1% of fully diluted rune supply) will be made on block 840,000. Each RSIC gets one ticket for this raffle for every consecutive block it was held in the address holding it when block 840,000 is mined.
