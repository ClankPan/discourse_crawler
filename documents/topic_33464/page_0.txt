The worldwide IT outage recently has affected millions of people around the world

If the ICP was the default internet medium worldwide instead of legacy tech, would that cure all future IT outages?

This would completely depend on the strength of the community and the level of decentralisation and due dilligence that takes place when the community accepts a new update. Greater levels of decentralisation + stronger community voting culture is actively being pushed for in numerous different ways - e.g -> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/do-u-c-what-ic-ic-proposals-that-mislead-and-a-10-000-icp-giveaway/33299

I think it's questionable

I assume bad code is still bad code and can possibly cause errors or outages. All it takes might be one line of disastrous code going through a proposal or removing a critical one and the affected part crashes. Assuming this can happen on both dapp level as blockchain/infrastructure level. I'm not a developer though but where there is human input, there is vulnerability.

ICP is software, ICP Ledger and NNS outage only within last month or so should tell you the answer to your question.

How does ICP solve a vendor update on a windows machine?

Any software is vulnerable to bugs.
