I've noticed that in my local replica setup (combo of `dfx replica` and `icx-proxy`), update calls from my agent-js client consistently take longer than 2 seconds, on the order of 4-5s.

Is that normal?

I haven't yet deployed that code to mainnet, but I'm hoping that updates are generally faster on mainnet (if that's even possible). For example, when I use Distrikt or other live apps, updates seem to take closer to 2-3s.
