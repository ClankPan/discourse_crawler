Thanks for the NNS [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/o4zdy6/we_are_david_johan_nicolas_and_ryan_ask_us/), but I still have a question and a request:

* How often are proposals GCed?

* Can I view historical proposals anywhere? I am missing 5k records since I was not archiving this data at network launch. The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ic-association/nns-proposals) contains some, but not all, historical proposals. Specifically, I am looking for KYC proposals in the range 1-340. This is quite [important data](https://ic.rocks/proposal/kyc) that should not be lost.

KYC proposals are now in the [Github](https://github.com/ic-association/nns-proposals/tree/main/proposals/kyc)! Turns out I wasn't missing any, but good to have a source of truth on this.
