I accidentally deleted the recovery device that was associated with a wallet, I have the Internet Identity number and another longer number but can not find my recovery phrase.  What can I do to reassociate the recovery device to the Internet Identity Number so that I can access the wallet again as I have assets staked in the wallet?

-------------------------

I have the long number that was associated with my device when I first set up my internet identity, can I use that to readd the device?

Did you delete only the recovery device, but can you still login with another device?

If you can, you should be able to add another recovery after logging in https://identity.ic0.app/

I only deleted the recovery device and then immediately added another device through the recovery phrase I had but when I used that recovery phrase I wasn’t able to see the tokens that were in the wallet on the new device even though the same internet identity was used on both.  What can I do to add the other device back as I think the recovery phrase was only for the wallet with no assets?

-------------------------

I was able to get back into the asset wallet one time after I did this.

Some questions to help you better:

* Where do you see the assets? Is it in NNS dapp (https://nns.ic0.app/)?
* What do you use as a recovery device? Is it a Ledger device?
* Do I understand right that you have two devices?
* What do you mean by "asset wallet"? Is it the NNS dapp?
* Can you share some screenshots of the wallet (hiding the account and balance)?

Sorry for the list, hehe. I'd like to understand you problem.

 I see the assets in the NNS Dapp wallet online.
I use an Iphone as a recovery device.
Yes, I have two different devices, both Iphones.
It is the nns.ic0.app.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If you see the neurons, can you explain what do you mean by:

[quote="llynn69, post:4, topic:31067"]

[/quote]

Are some neurons missing? Or the balance is not correct?

-------------------------

llynn69 | 2024-06-09 16:26:19 UTC | #9

I can see the neurons that are being staked but the wallet that was connected when I put the wrong recovery phrase in was mine and we need to be able to get into my husband’s wallet as that is where the tokens are stored.  We have since found his recovery phrase but since mine was put in after I deleted his recovery device because we couldn’t find his at the time, it shows it as an invalid recovery phrase.  I’ve asked support , after they told me to create a new passkey on his device, if we would then be able to access his wallet since we have his recovery phrase now or if it would create a new wallet and have yet to get a reply.

-------------------------

I believe you might need to a new device now.

Ledger has a blog post on how to do that: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9568409959581-Ledger-Recover-How-to-recover-access-to-your-wallet?docs=true

I don't think you can have one device with two identities, though. So, either you choose one or get another device.

Does that help?

-------------------------

We don’t have the ledger, we both use our iPhones.  If I deleted my phone as the recovery device, would we be able to recover his wallet on his phone using his recovery phrase?

How is that you lost your acces 30 days back, and you answer every 2 weeks?..

-------------------------

llynn69 | 2024-06-16 03:31:37 UTC | #14

Because of doing research on my own to try to get back in and waiting on an answer that’s actually helpful from those that are supposed to know more than I do about it.

Thanks for your patience @llynn69 , I was out of the office on holidays the last 10 days.

Do you have one or two Internet Identities?

What do you mean that you have your iPhone as Recovery Method? Only FIDO security keys, like Yubi keys are allowed.

But you can add your iPhone as devices and login with them as well, is that what you mean? You don't need to go over the recovery flow, you can directly log in with the iPhone.

Where do you see your phone as "Recovery device"?

Here:

Just in case, don't remove any device yet. That shouldn't affect recovering with the phrase.

I hope this helps or the answers will help me better understand the problem.

My husband’s iPhone was the recovery device associated with his internet identity and I accidentally deleted it but was able to recover the internet identity using my phone and what I thought was his recovery phrase, we both have internet identities and wallets. When I recovered his internet identity it linked to my iPhone and my wallet, since it was my recovery phrase but I can see the neurons we have staked and even vote on proposals it just shows nothing in the wallet as his wallet was the one that had the tokens in it. We have since found his recovery phrase but since I put mine in when recovering the wallet it doesn’t recognize his as being connected to his internet identity. What do I have to do to fix this because he needs access to the tokens when it comes time to sell?

Hi,

I can see how this is all confusing. That's why I need to ask some further questions, sorry.

You say you have two Internet Identities:

Xxxx: You husband's
Yyyy: Yours.

Is this correct?

You deleted the recovery device of Xxxx, and added your phone. Is this correct?

You can log in https://nns.ic0.app/ with Yyyy, but not with Xxxx. Is this correct?

You can log in https://identity.ic0.app/ with Xxxx, using the recovery device (which is your phone). Is this correct?

Would you mind answering those specific questions so that I can understand better your problem and help you?

Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi,

Yes have 2 internet identities. I deleted my husband’s recovery device by accident. I can log in to his internet identity with my recovery device as I added it as soon as I realized what happened and he couldn’t get back into his but when I reviewed the account I put in my recovery phrase, not his. I can see all of the neurons and am even able to vote on proposals, our neurons are staked. The wallet attached I believe is mine and it doesn’t have any of the tokens in it, his does. I have not tried logging into my internet identity as I have been trying to get his straight because that’s where our money is. I log in to https://www. nns.ic0.app/
Any help is greatly appreciated so we can gain access to his wallet again where we can sell our tokens when we’re ready. We have found his recovery phrase but since I put mine in when I recovered the identity it keeps telling us his isn’t put in correctly.

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-07-01 15:46:34 UTC | #19

Ok, thanks for the answers!

Did you try to add your husband's iPhone with "Add New Passkey" after logging in his identity with your phone?

![Screenshot 2024-07-01 at 17.43.12|641x499](upload://t379ThdIvvFlsrwgjoy3M36OKhG.jpeg)

Which identity do you use in https://nns.ic0.app/ when you see the neurons? Yours or your husband's?

-------------------------

llynn69 | 2024-07-01 19:25:41 UTC | #20

Yes, it won’t allow us to add it back. I don’t know if it’s because it’s still showing his passkey is saved in his passwords even though it doesn’t work. We haven’t deleted it yet because we didn’t want to mess anything else up. We use his internet identity to see the neurons but it has my wallet attached because of using my recovery phrase instead of his.

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2024-07-02 06:43:12 UTC | #21

Could you send me a screenshot per DM of what you mean by "because it’s still showing his passkey is saved in his password"? Do you mean that it's in the "Recovery Methods"?

![Screenshot 2024-07-02 at 08.41.00|382x342](upload://cmuJiTgHa2ydgbUSHMJL0USM1Zu.jpeg)

Do you have more passkeys attached that you control? If so, it's save to remove it and add it again.

One more question. What do you mean by "it has my wallet attached"? Is the wallet a Hardware Wallet?

Thanks!
