Today, I'm excited to present to you a new software that will decentralize how you interact with the Internet Computer: The Local [IC HTTP Proxy](https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy). This solution is designed to establish a fully decentralized and verifiable communication channel with dApps, opening new doors for seamless interaction with the network.

<big>What is the local IC HTTP Proxy?</big>

The Local IC HTTP Proxy is a proof-of-concept application that allows your local system to act as a proxy for communicating with the Internet Computer. It harnesses the power of certification and completely bypasses the usage of the [Boundary Node's HTTP Gateway](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Boundary_Nodes) that has been the existing approach up until now.

</div>

*<div align=center>Figure 2: Internet Computer HTTP connections With the IC HTTP Proxy</div>*

As shown on Figure 2, the HTTP Gateway with the IC HTTP Proxy enabled is completely moved to your local device, this shifts remote connections to exclusively be utilizing the API Boundary Nodes that are also being decentralized in the near future as explained on [this post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-node-roadmap/15562).

<big>How Does It Work?</big>

Instead of a remote server that typically acts as an intermediary between your system and the Internet Computer, the local IC HTTP Proxy places this power in your hands. The proxy runs locally, providing a direct and decentralized channel to communicate with dApps running on the Internet Computer.

The proxy implements the [IC HTTP Gateway Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#http-gateway), translating the default HTTP requests into the expected api calls to the canister. Also, it leverages the `_canister-id` DNS TXT records available for custom domains to determine what canister that domain is serving. This way, your requests and data get processed directly by the API Boundary Node and all the HTTP transformation and verification happen locally in the proxy.

Last but certainly not least, it terminates TLS locally for dApp domains so that you can completely avoid the existing centralized Certificate Authorities.

<big>How to start the Proxy?</big>

After the proxy is installed in your system (currently supports Windows and MacOSX), launch the application and a taskbar item will appear, by clicking it you can simply start and all your HTTP IC connections will be made secure through it.

<big>What happens to my non IC network connections while running the Proxy?</big>

The IC HTTP Proxy only cares about Internet Computer network connections, for all others it does a passthrough not handling them in any way. 

<big>What's the Benefit?</big>

The implications of this approach are wide-ranging:

**Decentralization:** The key principle of blockchain technology, decentralization, is strengthened by eliminating the need for centralized servers for communication (as mentioned above API Boundary Nodes are also being decentralized in the near future).

**Enhanced Performance:** The system efficiency is optimized as the service worker no longer needs to be loaded, which improves the time to load dApps on the first visit.

**Greater Control:** By allowing your system to communicate directly with the API Boundary Node, you have increased control over your network interactions and can bypass centralized Certificate Authorities for the remote implementations of the IC HTTP Gateway Protocol.

<big>**Call to Action: Try it yourself!**</big>

As this is still experimental, I'm inviting you to be part of this testing phase. Your feedback is of utmost importance to both me and the entire Trust team, as it will significantly influence the future development of this project. Be it a bug report, a feature suggestion, or even a success story, we are eager to hear it all.

You can download the Local IC HTTP Proxy from the [releases page](https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy/releases) and start exploring. For tech-savvy users interested in diving deep into the software codebase and building from scratch, our comprehensive [documentation](https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy) serves as an essential guide. Remember to share your feedback in this thread.

Let's embrace the future of decentralized communication together! We look forward to your active participation.

Isn't this a proxy that can change IP addresses? Why hasn't my IP changed?

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-06-01 07:15:08 UTC | #5

Hi @icper, it won't change your ip address! This proxy is running locally, which means that it will still use your own public IP Address. The goal of this proxy is not to change your IP, rather, it's to move the IC HTTP Gateway Protocol to your local device and terminate the TLS locally for you which will avoid the centralized Certificate Authorities on the HTTP side, with it you can communicate directly with API Boundary Nodes that will be decentralized in the near future.

Moreover, with the proxy enabled you won't have the service worker being loaded when you visit a dApp, the proxy will take care of its responsibilities. This also means that a dApp that you visit can have their very own service worker delivered from an asset canister.

If you want to change your IP Address, you should still be able to add a VPN connection in your device and the IC HTTP Proxy should work on top of it.

Hello! Thank you very much for your detailed reply! But I am a non-computer professional, can you explain the benefits of enabling this agent more simply?

-------------------------

ysyms | 2023-06-01 11:41:53 UTC | #9

I seem to be unable to start, regardless of whether I use a VPN or not. The device is a MacBook M1 Pro, and the software version I downloaded is ic-http-proxy-mac-universal-0.0.2-alpha.dmg.

This proxy creates a direct connection to the Internet Computer's API endpoint, skipping the Boundary Node's HTTP Gateway, which makes it the most decentralized way of accessing the Internet Computer today.

**Some of the benefits that this would enable are:**

- Decentralization
- Faster load times on the first visit to a new dApp domain
- Support for crypto domains in the future

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-06-01 12:17:24 UTC | #11

That's interesting, thanks for the details and the screenshots! You should have logs under `~/Library/Preferences/dfinity/ichttpproxy` to help debug the issue. 

Feel free to PM me with the logs. I'm happy to help debug the issue.

It’s going to be a hard sell to get me to install a proxy.

-------------------------

icper | 2023-06-02 02:45:24 UTC | #13

If you can bundle it with some useful tools, I think it's a good idea. It's really hard to convince people to download it

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-06-02 09:38:29 UTC | #14

Thanks for the feedback! Did you have some ideas of what useful tools that you would like included in the proxy?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-06-02 09:39:47 UTC | #15

It's understandable that you would be cautious installing a proxy on your system. Would you like to discuss your reservations further? It's important to us that people can feel comfortable using this software.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-06-02 14:06:57 UTC | #16

I have to trust you wont be snooping through my traffic right? It's not that I don't trust you all but it just doesn't seem like I need to take the risk.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-06-02 14:36:13 UTC | #17

It's true that any proxy has the ability to snoop on system traffic, but you don't have to "trust" us that this proxy is not doing that. The code is open source and can be verified by you, or anyone else.

The zip distributable is built deterministically (unfortunately the "native" installers are very difficult to build deterministically) or the application can be built directly, the only dependencies necessary are [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

isn't the application built and installed in the nodes? Can i verify those are acting correctly?

Btw I'm not being passive aggressive. I'm genuinely asking .

>Btw I’m not being passive aggressive. I’m genuinely asking .

Don't worry, these are important questions to ask!

> isn’t the application built and installed in the nodes? Can i verify those are acting correctly?

Ah are you referring to how a standard proxy will send your traffic to a remote server? That's not how this proxy works. There's no remote server receiving your traffic because the proxying happens locally on your computer. The proxy server that's running on your local computer communicates directly with the Internet Computer network on an encrypted connection in the same way the Service Worker does when it's installed in your browser.

So the proxy application _could_ snoop on your traffic, but since it runs entirely on your machine, you can verify the code before you build it and then you can see that it's not doing any snooping.

1. The first utility software I can think of is the v-p-n proxy server of the official icp, but I don't know whether it can be done

To, the reason is that if I want to speed up must be my network environment is not good, so I need to change the IP


2. A second useful piece of software might be a desktop-based nns polling system or wallet, but it is much simpler to understand than the web.

3. A third utility might be a pledge/mining software based on resolving domain name services, which people might download and install if they could generate revenue.

-------------------------

Icdev2dev | 2023-06-02 23:42:54 UTC | #22

This is awesome work.

Since i do have all the necessary infrastructure to get this build going, i will take you up on the offer of getting a reproducible build. Which zip file should i  be comparing against?


If everything goes well, i can propose to CodeGov that we (as a part of the community) can verify additional builds. Of course this wiĺl involve "invasive" code review everytime there's an update (as well as initially). Of course the verification would be on "best effort".

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-06-02 23:50:26 UTC | #23

As a non-technical person, here is my cursory read on the above...

Download this peice of software to speed up connection to the IC and thus enhanced performance. The decentralization and greater control piece do not affect my user experience...

So my first question is, can I download this on mobile too? And secondly, I do not know how to download and run software from github. Will you make this more accessible?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2023-06-03 19:06:09 UTC | #24

FYI I am getting an error when trying to log into OpenChat using Internet Identity:

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 at 12.04.03 PM|489x500](upload://nosonti7xiVPhBKFhgGOrldPBe3.jpeg)

I don't get this when the proxy is not running.

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-06-03 19:21:24 UTC | #25

Hi @jzxchiang 

There was an issue in OpenChat independent of the IC HTTP Proxy, which caused the same problem and should have been resolved. I just tried to reproduce it, but didn't manage. For me it worked, with the IC HTTP Proxy. Could you provide is with more details, please: do you try to access OpenChat over oc.app or the canister URL

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-06-03 19:25:49 UTC | #26

Hi @dfisher 

To download the software, just go to [Github](https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy) and click on either the "install mac OS X" or the "install windows" button (see screenshot) based on the operating system you are using. This will download the installer.

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 at 21.23.04|690x67](upload://6O9Q1woTKz7KOpM7hVmj4GWaeXq.png)


This is still a proof-of-concept and we are trying to gather community feedback. Therefore, we don't have a mobile version yet. Based on the feedback, we will further improve the proxy and its user experience.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2023-06-03 19:29:10 UTC | #27

Unfortunately, it's still happening to me. It only happens when I try logging in from a logged out state.

It happens when I click on Launch app:

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 at 12.27.17 PM|690x371](upload://bSZRtKDpV7qQGFi6lDTd9Z8gJug.jpeg)

It then opens a new tab with URL https://identity.ic0.app/#authorize containing the error message I showed above.

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-06-05 06:50:01 UTC | #28

Hi @Mania, this proxy is still a proof of concept, the only supported platforms are Windows and MacOSX. 

With that in mind, we've already tested how this would look like on mobile and it is possible to accomplish the same end result as with the Desktop proxy with a slightly different approach, however, at this stage we are collecting community feedback for the Desktop version, this will help improve it's capabilities and user experience. 

Once we have established a baseline of what capabilities it would need to offer, we can focus on making a stable release of this Desktop proxy version and after that focus on alternatives such as supporting mobile platforms.

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-06-05 06:55:33 UTC | #29

That's awesome @Icdev2dev, you have three zip files on the release page, for Windows, Intel Mac and Arm Mac. Let me know if you run into any issues.

raymondk | 2023-06-15 20:37:54 UTC | #32

@MillionMiles when you start the propxy, are you getting the prompt to enter your admin password?

You can also try launching the app from your terminal under: `/Applications/IC HTTP Proxy.app/Contents/MacOS` and see some logs in the console maybe that would give us a good indication of what is happening.

hokosugi | 2023-07-19 21:52:45 UTC | #37

This is a rudimentary question,
I'm not sure if the communication to the API boundary node is encrypted afterwards if you terminate TLS locally. Regardless of local termination of TLS,
are API calls from the HTTP gate way to the boundary node encrypted?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-07-19 22:22:29 UTC | #38

Great question!

TLS is terminated locally to allow for translating standard web requests to a format that the IC can understand. The translated requests are then sent to the API boundary nodes through a new TLS connection so everything remains encrypted.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-07-19 22:43:33 UTC | #39

Thank you!
So you're saying that the TLS termination at the HTTP Gate way has been replaced by a local one, so one of the centralized pathways has been eliminated, so one step more decentralized?
However, the Local -> API Boundary node still requires a TLS connection and the message is encrypted and protected, but the centralization is not yet completely eliminated.

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-07-19 22:56:19 UTC | #40

Yes that's exactly right! Once the API boundary nodes are fully decentralized (which is in progress), using this proxy will be a fully end to end decentralized solution.

-------------------------

bblist | 2023-09-08 02:48:24 UTC | #41

And the cost regarding cycles?

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2023-09-08 08:15:18 UTC | #42

> And the cost regarding cycles?

Are you referring to the proxy?
The proxy runs locally, not on the network so there is no cycle cost associated with it.

-------------------------

jasonkingss | 2023-11-25 22:48:05 UTC | #43

The Local IC HTTP Proxy introduces a paradigm shift in how users interact with the Internet Computer, emphasizing decentralization and verifiability. This proof-of-concept application leverages certification, providing users with a direct and secure communication channel with dApps, thereby eliminating the need for the existing Boundary Node's HTTP Gateway.

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-28 02:50:22 UTC | #44

How could I go about verifying the code as a person who understands little code?

-------------------------

rbirkner | 2023-11-28 20:34:53 UTC | #45

Without knowing how to code, it might be a bit difficult. One idea I had would be to use an AI assistant such as copilot or chatgpt. So far I have been very impressed by how it explains code snippets. This however means that you are again trusting another party.

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-30 01:32:26 UTC | #46

@wpb is this something you and CodeGov have the ability to look into? I know you guys mostly review the replica code of the IC but as the only coders I am aware of that do public reviews I figured I'd ask.

-------------------------

Samer | 2024-04-28 15:31:29 UTC | #48

How do we setup the Http proxy locally and configure it to point to dfx?

I want to test Certification v2 responses locally (without manually verifying the response coming from dfx)

-------------------------

NathanosDev | 2024-04-28 15:37:04 UTC | #49

If you return an `IC-Certificate` header with your response then it is already verified by `icx-proxy` in dfx, so there's no need to set up a separate proxy.

If you're also interested in making some automated tests with PocketIC to verify the responses, you can check out this [example project](https://github.com/dfinity/response-verification/blob/main/examples/http-certification/json-api/src/tests/src/todos.spec.ts#L76-L84).

The same could be done with the Rust client for PocketIC too.

Great! But when the `IC-Certificate` header is not present, it just passes correct?

-------------------------

Yep, that's correct.
