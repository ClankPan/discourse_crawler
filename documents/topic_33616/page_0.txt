Hello, we are a time focused blockchain called Clockchain. 

We have a logging system that lets you store and timestamp critical data on the Clockchain Network. 

This ensures that your critical data is not only safe and retrievable at some later date but allows the user to authenticate that data from anywhere in the world instantly. 

With our logging/timestamp and searchable chain, never worry whether your data is a deep fake or false ever again. By comparing your present data to previously logged data users can quickly check and verify their data. 

Our chain is fast allowing you to log 10,000 times a second making industrial use of our chain a reality. 

In addition we have a time service that sends out verified time accurate down to the second. And allows automated systems verify the time it is using is indeed accurate.

And should you then want to prove the time you used was indeed utilized at the correct time or show a client you executed something at the correct time you can always log your time data usage on the Clockchain for future reference at the same time.

Please email me if you are interested as we are looking for great partners all the time. 

Thank you for reading. Hope you have a great day!
