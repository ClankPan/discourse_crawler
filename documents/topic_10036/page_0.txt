Dear Dfinity experts, 

Getting the below error while upgrading or deploying the canister

Upgrading code for canister xxx, with canister_id xxx-iaaaa-xxxx-qaeia-cai
The invocation to the wallet call forward method failed with the error: An error happened during the call: 5: Canister xxx-iaaaa-xxxx-qaeia-cai trapped explicitly: IDL error: variant or record tag out of order

Thank you in advance.
Regards
Tanish
