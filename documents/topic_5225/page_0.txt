Hi! I'm a new developer trying to figure out how the Internet Computer works and I'm having a lot of trouble right now, so I'm not sure if this is a dumb question but I'd appreciate some sort of clarification: How do I create a new canister within an existing project? Say I run `dfx new hello`. Then I understand that I have just created the canisters "hello" and "hello_assets". However, how do I create a new canister within this project? Do I run `dfx new` again? But that would create two more canisters. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Hi rban,

`dfx new` gives you a template for an application, but after it's there, you can modify it however you like. The entrypoint of the config is in `dfx.json`, which you can then customize to rename the canisters, add new ones to the json, or remove any you weren't using. I recommend looking at https://github.com/dfinity/examples for references
