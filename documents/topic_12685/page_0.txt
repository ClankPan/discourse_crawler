Hi there!

I realized there had been no announcement when the [Internet Identity forum category](https://forum.dfinity.org/c/internet-identity/32) was created. It's the perfect place for everything II related, so check it out if you want to create a post related to II, or if you're interested in II!

Hope to see you there
