There is also another version `cabe2ae3`, which enabled QUIC state sync, which will enable nodes to become productive faster after they join a subnet.
* [[cabe2ae3](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/cabe2ae3)] Networking: feat: Enable QUIC state sync

This version will be deployed to a few subnets only in this rollout cycle, to get a signal from the production deployment. It will be deployed to all other subnets in the coming weeks.
