Hello everybody!

After months of hard work, long code reviews and negotiations [MSQ Snap](https://icp.msq.tech/) finally hits the MetaMask Snaps Store, which officially means MSQ is now in **Public Beta 1.0**  :tada: :tada: :tada:

https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/fort-major/msq/

Here is a one-minute video explainer of what is MSQ:

https://vimeo.com/931708010?share=copy

For more information, visit our website:

https://icp.msq.tech

## Call For Action

If you're building a dApp and want to add a proper `Login with MetaMask` button to it, DM me here or send an email to `sasha@msq.tech`. I'll guide you through the integration process (which is super easy, btw). You could also [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/RMxyF5Huhs) and contact me there, if that works better for you.

Also, you can integrate with MSQ without our help. There is a tutorial on how to do that available [at our Github](https://github.com/fort-major/msq/blob/master/documentation/integration.md).

MetaMask's user base is [~30M people](https://blockworks.co/news/metamask-monthly-active-users-blockaid). Many of them are mobile users and Snaps don't yet work with mobile MetaMask, but anyways. It is a huge number of people, all of which will be able to access your dApp without installing or setting up any additional software or hardware.

## Our Achievements So Far

MSQ's codebase [has been successfully audited](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2024/03/msq-snap/) by Consensys Diligence. Moreover, for several last weeks its code was reviewed by MetaMask's team, which is very careful when it comes to letting Snaps into the Store.

We (MSQ team) have secured multiple significant grants to fund this work: one from MetaMask Grants DAO and another from Dfinity Foundation. To receive validation from multiple respected entities was our initial goal. As another proof of our commitment and expertise.

## Future Plans

**May-June 2024**

- **MSQ Pay**: We're introducing an enhanced payment method that supports multiple cryptocurrencies but operates in U.S. dollar equivalents. Sellers can create on-chain invoices in dollars, and buyers can pay in any listed currency at the current exchange rates sourced from [ICPCoins dApp](https://icpcoins.com/). This system simplifies crypto transactions, making them as straightforward as using traditional money.
- **Currency Display**: All assets in MSQ will show their value in USD to make it easier for users to understand and use cryptocurrency.

**July 2024**

- **User Profile and Contacts**: Users will have the option to add personal information to their profiles and create a contacts list. This will streamline the process of sending money, allowing users to select recipients from their contacts instead of entering account details manually.

**August-September 2024**

- **Shops without Shops**: Users can set up a dedicated product page linked to their MSQ wallet, similar to a feature offered by Stripe. This allows users to sell products directly through MSQ, enhancing the adoption of cryptocurrency for everyday transactions.

**October 2024**

- **Crypto Gifts**: We are developing a feature that allows users to send cryptocurrency as gifts directly from their MSQ wallet. This can be done within their contacts list or to new users who haven't joined MSQ yet, using a secure method that involves delivering a cryptographic key pair.

## Outro

Thanks for reading! Give it a try, let us know what you think and ask anything.

Take care!

This is an amazing product. I just set up a wallet in my metamask. Silky smooth experience, congrats!

Right now my app only uses grandaddy II as an auth option, but I'll reach you about adding this once I get to the rest.

Things like this make me so happy to see. 

My first thought was....man..who is doing this...can it be trusted...I haven't heard of MSQ...lots of worry and then I look and the author and it is senior.joinu...heh! I know that name!

![image|558x500](upload://3ZiaRmapvXSzyRp1EF4t0ZAxg7W.png)

If we all stick around here long enough we are going to build some awesome stuff!!!!

Congrats on getting through all the audits. I can't wait to try it out.  Just having it on Desktop is amazing and if we can get snaps on mobile this will be a rocket ship for the IC.

[quote="skilesare, post:12, topic:30499"]
-What is a “mask”? Sound interesting!
[/quote]

MSQ works very similarly to Internet Identity in terms of privacy. In II we have one separate identity per website and if we want to login to a website with a new identity, we create a new anchor. In MSQ there are no anchors, you just can create and use as many masks for each website you want.

The "Mask" is an identity. A key pair that only exists inside your MetaMask extension. We use that word to hide technical details and also emphasize that it kinda "hides" who you really are from the website you're interacting with. You can have multiple masks per every website you've logged in to. 

[quote="skilesare, post:12, topic:30499"]

[/quote]

Yes, feedback here is good. Thanks a lot!

I assume, you're having this issue because your vertical screen size is not enough. Since it is a desktop app, for now we designed it to be a minimum of 800px vertically. But since it is the first day after realease and you're already hitting that limit, we should probably fix that. :)

-------------------------

senior.joinu | 2024-05-10 10:51:32 UTC | #14

Hey @skilesare 
The issue should be resolved by now. This popup should render properly on smaller resolutions.

Thanks once again for pointing this one out!

-------------------------

senior.joinu | 2024-05-13 11:43:01 UTC | #15

Good news!

11 projects already replied with interest to our proposal to try integrating MSQ into their dApps.
Obviously, those are spoken agreements, they don't guarantee success, but we believe this is a decent outcome, considering the release happened only 5 days ago.

By the way, now you can also text us via Telegram: [@msqwallet](https://t.me/msqwallet)
We also have a Twitter account by the same handle: [@msqwallet](https://twitter.com/msqwallet)

jennifertran | 2024-05-13 15:38:51 UTC | #16

Looks good overall!

1. You should make it clear that you are creating a new principal to interact with. There does not seem to be to load an existing principal.

2. You should also make it clear that you see all of your token balances through the MSQ site and not Metamask.

-------------------------

senior.joinu | 2024-05-13 16:07:53 UTC | #17

Thanks for the feedback!

How do you think, what is the best way to make this information more visible?


We have UI screenshots in MetaMask Snaps Store. They show very clearly how all of this work.

![image|690x232](upload://fARDC8oDZWFbAC60RD0vfAVVaQV.jpeg)

Our promo video contains similar information, but in action:

https://vimeo.com/931708010

And the UI mockups from our landing page also include a little bit of this information:

![Screenshot from 2024-05-13 18-56-41|689x344](upload://2EhIptRLz5s9r058qiMtO5LaVxh.png)

We could include the video into the landing page, probably.

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2024-05-13 18:29:33 UTC | #18

Can you explicitly mention the "MSQ Dashboard" (or the name of the web interface)?

-------------------------

senior.joinu | 2024-05-13 18:31:29 UTC | #19

I’m not quite sure I understand you. Mention where? And what exactly?

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2024-05-13 18:35:05 UTC | #20

Metamask users usually interact only with the Metamask app itself. It should be clear that you can connect Metamask on MSQ and interact with ICP through the MSQ dapp/dashboard/website. However, you are not going to be able to view anything that you see the tokens and balances listed on the MSQ dapp/dashboard/website within the Metamask app itself.

Hi everyone!
I got some great news.

You can use MSQ to login to Sonic DEX now!
https://app.sonic.ooo/

Also, MSQ is now integrated into [Artemis wallet connector](https://github.com/sonicdex/artemis). So if you're already using it, just make sure to upgrade it to version `1.0.2` or higher to add MSQ to your dapp with zero effort. 

Have a wonderful week!

jennifertran | 2024-06-11 00:12:55 UTC | #22

Hello there, can you please elaborate on how the scoped-identity architecture helps protect users from signature-stealing attacks?

-------------------------

senior.joinu | 2024-06-11 09:48:52 UTC | #23

Hi @jennifertran,
Great question!

MSQ's scoped-identities work very similar to how it is done in the Internet Identity, so they provide similar security features.

Imagine you're using ExampleSwap DEX on daily basis. One day you're browsing Reddit and see a post like this `Only today! ExampleSwap's final airdrop! Perform a single swap and become eligible for it! https://app.exampieswap.com`. 

You follow the link, and find yourself on ExampleSwap. Everything looks and works the same. You see the same pools, same exchange rates, usual UIs and data everywhere. The only thing that is different is that you're not authorized for some reason. But the website, once you enter, shows you a pop-up like `Your authorization session has expired to keep you safe. Please re-connect your wallet.` You think "yeah, that's how dApps on the IC usually work - they deauthorize you from time to time, so I guess it is fine". Now let's consider two scenarios.

**1 You use some global-identity wallet** (no names to not offend anyone) 

You re-connect your wallet, it says something like `This website wants to be able to call these 45 canisters, do you allow it?`. Obviously, you don't check every canister ID manually, you just check a couple of them, see that they are the same as the last time you authorized, and press "Allow". Now you think "Okay, looks like it is time to swap ang get the airdrop!". You choose the ICP/EXE pair, select amounts and press the `Swap` button. Your wallet says `This website wants to perform a batch of transactions on your behalf: Approve ICP, Transfer ICP - do you agree?`. Everything seems normal, so you agree. Everything happens as usual, you see the swap is performed. Let's imagine that the exchange rate is 1:1, so when you check your wallet you see that exaclty N ICP was deducted from it and exactly N EXE was added to it. Everything is great. The website even shows you a message like `You're now eligible for the airdrop, which will be distributed today at 23:59 EST. Thank you and have a great day!`

You turn off your computer and go for a walk with your friends. The next day you check you balance again to find out that you no longer own any ICP - they are all gone.

Turns out this was a phishing website. It was a perfect copy of ExampleSwap that was connected directly to ExampleSwap's canisters. But instead of performing your swaps directly via liquidity pool canisters, it performed them though a proxy canister. When you approved ICP, you actually approved it to that proxy canister, which instead of asking for N ICP allowance, asked for 1.000.000 ICP allowance. Then it performed the swap for you and transferred you the EXEs. It did everything as you would expect to not raise any alarms early and be able to trick more people like you the same way. Then, after several hours it just transferred all the ICP's from your wallet, since you allowed it to do so via the `ICRC2 approve` call. 

You could save yourself from this attack, but this would require you to manually check all the consent messages and payloads that the wallet is trying to sign. For example, you could notice a new canister (proxy canister) among 44 old ones during the wallet connection phase. But most probably you would just think that this is some new canister ExampleSwap has added to their list. 
Or you could notice that a canister ID targeted for the `approve ICP` call is different from ExampleSwap's ICP/EXE pool canister ID. But most probably you don't remember ICP/EXE pool canister ID and you would be too lazy to check it through the dashboard. 
You could also notice that the allowance amount is way higher than your swap amount, but many dApps do that - they ask you for a bigger allowance to not call this method multiple times and be able to just transfer from you without bothering you with another consent message.
And of course, you could notice that the domain name is different - it is `exampieswap.com` and not `exampleswap.com` - but this requires some focus. And most probably, once you click on that link and see that everything looks exactly the same, you won't second guess yourself about checking the domain name. Especially if you're in a rush to go get outside to see your friends.

So, in this scenario, the chances your signature for the `ICRC2 approve` method being stolen are pretty high, even if you are an experienced crypto user. For newbies this rate is almost 100%. 

Why don't we see these attacks happening yet? My personal understanding is that because IC's DeFi space is tiny (in comparison with Ethereum). A real attack on some DEX like Sonic or ICPSwap like this would yield... $30k, $50k at best luck? Since creating a perfect website clone like this would already cost at least half of that amount, it is simply not worth it. But if nothing changes, and the space grows over time, we will definitely see cases like this - on Ethereum [they happen very often](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/approval-phishing-cryptocurrency-scams-2023/). 

**2 You use some scoped-identity system, like MSQ or Internet Identity**

You re-connect your wallet only to find out that for some reason it offers you a different set of identities for this website. They don't match the old ones - you have a different principal now for some reason. Let's assume you're super-unfocused right now and don't notice that.

You continue to the DEX. You navigate to the `swaps` tab and try to swap ICP for EXE. But for some reason you don't own any ICP. You're refreshing the page, thinking that this might be a connectivity problem, but nothing changes. 

And that's it. End of story. Even if you're an absolute newbie, you will most probably try rebooting your pc and opening ExampleSwap again. If you open it via your bookmarks, you'll figure out that there is no airdrop. And even if you don't figure it out - making a swap via the legit website is absolutely safe. If you open it via the same phishing link again, you'll see that nothing has changed and you're going to ask questions.

There is no way to perform such an attack when your identity system uses website's origin as a seed for keypair generation. Even if you figure out a way to use cyrillic letters instead of latin in your phishing domain name ("eхampleswap.com" - "х" is cyrillic vs "exampleswap.com" - all latin) - you can't fool the hashing algorithm, because these letters have different byte content anyway.

**Conclusion**

Scoped-identity auth systems (as MSQ) are just superior in terms of protecting users against nasty stuff online. Yes, there are problems with interoperability such systems introduce. But it will all be figured out in a couple of years. The most important thing is to guarantee safety.

By the way, if you're interested in security, check out an article we've made together with Consensus Diligence. They liked to audit our Snap and offered us to tell others how to write code that is easy to audit.

https://metamask.io/news/developers/5-security-audit-tips-from-msq-snap-and-consensys-diligence/

And a bit of news: you can use MSQ to sign in to three DEXes on the IC:
* [Sonic](https://app.sonic.ooo/)
* [ICPSwap](https://app.icpswap.com/)
* [ICPex](https://icpex.org/)

Great, it could bring more users to ecosystem. 

Looking for future integration
