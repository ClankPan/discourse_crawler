Hello!

We're about to launch Cosmicrafts Reforged and want to share with you some information about the game, how it was built and what we went through.

1. **Project Highlights**
  * **Description:** Cosmicrafts is a real-time strategy game fully integrated with a Web3 economy, running entirely on the Internet Computer. We aim to bring action and fun to Web3 gaming with a cohesive free-to-play, play-to-earn model. The game features player progress elements such as upgradable ICRC7 NFTs, ICRC1 free tokens, user profiles with statistics, missions/achievements with rewards, and NFT Lootboxes that can be opened or transferred.
  * **Target Users:** Our target audience includes gamers who enjoy real-time strategy games and are interested in Web3 gaming experiences.
  * **Problem/Need:** Cosmicrafts addresses the need for sustainable, free-to-play and long-term engagement in Web3 gaming by providing a player-owned economy and true asset ownership.
2. **Web3 Advantages**
  * Cosmicrafts leverages successful Web2 gaming examples and transforms them into a Web3 experience. The game focuses on community and player progress, offering a unique player-owned economy and true asset ownership.
3. **How It Is Built**
  * **Languages/Frameworks:** Canisters are built with Motoko, while Unity is used as the game engine with C# as the main language. ICP.NET is the main tool for communication with the Internet Computer. Boom DAO tools are used to automate processes. The login website is developed with Javascript, and blockchain wallets are integrated by creating an ICP wallet from a unique signed message.
4. **ICP Superpowers**
  * The Internet Computer's gasless fees remove technological barriers for users, providing a seamless experience. The speed of ICP ensures that players enjoy a similar Web2 experience in terms of responsiveness and performance.
5. **Go-To-Market Strategy**
  * Our strategy focuses on testing the product and building a community. With tokens, NFTs, lootboxes, and a ranked game mode, we plan to scale competitively and enter the esports market. Airdrops, seasonal events, and a mission and season pass system will also be utilized to engage users and build the community.
6. **Monetization**
  * Cosmicrafts is built for profit, with plans to monetize through a central store and marketplace. The launch of SNS as a DAO is a key objective, enabling community governance and participation.
7. **Status**
  * Cosmicrafts has been in development since 2016, with many iterations over the years. The current version represents a significant milestone as it completes the integration of the Web3 economy. While there is still work to be done, we anticipate a final release/global launch within the next year.

Kept it short, if you have any questions let me know!
