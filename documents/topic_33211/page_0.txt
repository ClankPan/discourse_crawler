Regarding the discussion of mobile application products' development.
1. Satslink uses II, it is necessary to further investigate and evaluate whether IC compatible internet identify can provide a better experience. Is there any other solution that is better, such as MSQ? 
2. Satslink is a VPN product that requires payment, so we plan to use cycles and ICP for payment. Of course, cycles is the best choice for the application because it is stable. Can I directly use canister to receive payments for cycles？

These changes primarily reflect updates in the key features of our project.
1. Uer authorization - Each user receives a unique and dedicated identity for every domain they interact with via user authorization.
2. Payment System - Based on MSQ, allowing direct purchases of ICP and ICRC-1, and payment of service fees within the IC ecosystem.
3. Pricing - Designed based on the IC Exchange Rate Canister, ensuring dynamic and fair pricing for Satslink’s services.

These changes aim to enhance the clarity and functionality of our proposal, highlighting the innovative integration of MSQ and the dynamic pricing mechanism based on the IC Exchange Rate Canister.
