## Features

* These changes are in preparation for the upcoming [https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-schnorr-facilitating-brc-20-trading-solana-integration-certificate-signing-and-more/28993](Threshold Schnorr feature).

    * Registry subnet records now support more generic master public keys, enabling the threshold Schnorr signature scheme in addition to (priorly supported) threshold ECDSA scheme.
    * Since the ECDSA-specific data has already been migrated to the generic format, this release switches the source of truth from the legacy to the new format.
    * The following NNS governance proposals have been extended to support the new generic master public keys: Create Subnet, Update Subnet Config, Recover Subnet.
    * The Registry now allows for new master public keys to be added to an existing signing subnet. Removing keys held by a signing subnet is still forbidden.

The CodeGov project completed reviews for the proposals and voted to adopt them. You can find details on [OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/168083459961697538699863191526193241390/94).
At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.
