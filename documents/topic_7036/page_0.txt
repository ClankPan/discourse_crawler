Hi,

So far my tests with Dfinity make calls between canisters that belong to the same project and they are deployed at the same time with the same owner. So all users' data are in the owner's canister.

I imagine a scenario with two canisters (A and B), that B could be deployed n times by different owners. Registration would be done dynamically using an UI with A. So A could send messages to instances of B that do not belong to the same owners.

I looked at the [pub-sub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/pub-sub) example but they are deployed with the same owner

1) Is this possible ? 
2) If yes, what could be the (good) approach ?

Thanks for suggestions
