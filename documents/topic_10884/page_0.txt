Just a quick update on the bounty program.  We have more resources now, but we are adjusting how we denominate our bounties.  Some of the ICP we have in the treasury and we can let that float with the market price and offer some upside to longer-term bounties.  Some of the other resources we are going to start denominating in USD so that we can determine the number of ICP at the time the prize is awarded.  You can see our latest bounties with the updated numbers at: https://icdevs.org/bounties.html.

@skilesare ,

I have an idea for a bounty related to C++.

What is the best way to pitch it?

Thanks!

I wonder if anyone is working on the sqlite + stable memory [effort](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sqlite-backed-by-stable-memory-the-perfect-match/9998).

Sqlite should already work on wasm linear memory. I think the only action item is to make it work on stable memory (not trivial).

That could actually be a huge multiplier on developer velocity. Imagine "SQL on blockchain". A big deal IMO.
