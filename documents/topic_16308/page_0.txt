**What am I proposing?**

The proposal changes the value of transactions from 0.0001 ICP to a fixed value in USD $0.01 (or equivalent in current cycles so as not to take the USD as a reference). In each transaction the equivalent of $0.01 would be burned

**Why am I proposing it?**

Because I think that we must help reduce the impact of inflation in bear markets, in addition to helping to make the cost of the transaction more consistent regardless of the price of the token.

(I want to thank @smaug, (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/scaling-transaction-fees/16257) @THLO @diegop and @bogdanwarinschi for encouraging me to share this simple idea, although I think dfinity thought of everything and such a simple idea would seem like a joke compared to all the research out there on the price of a transaction but maybe it's not such a bad idea)

![Balance|459x324](upload://56u4A8r9JDqEB71b4xmd0MUI7Dx.jpeg)


**Why can such a simple proposal work?**

More complex ideas may come up related to dynamic cost values ​​or cycle costs (I thought of more complex options), but I'll leave all of that because I think keeping tokenomics simple and transparent serves us all. Fiat values ​​are easy to understand and everyone measures everything in fiat values.

**What impact does it have on current applications?**

Basically the impact does not exist, since the transactions of any app need to increase exponentially for them to have an impact (possibly positive).
We must also reflect that at prices of $100 per ICP it would be exactly the same scenario.

**What impact can it have in the long term?**

The impact at current values ​​with the number of current transactions will have almost no impact, this is long-term thinking, considering the expansion of the ecosystem and the volume of transactions of long-term applications (Games, Defi, social etc etc)

In the long term the positive points are:

* Decrease the volatility of the token price in the future. :white_check_mark:
* Help reduce inflation with low token prices (more tokens would be burned at low prices) :fire:
* Developers have a clearer long-term picture of the costs incurred by exponentially increasing the number of transactions. :motoko_go:

I share a very simple table and graph where you can get an idea of ​​the potential that you can have just by applying this proposal.

![grafico|690x293](upload://eRQngvyNDmQhcnut0WHKlQu5Ehm.jpeg)

I appreciate any feedback you have!

Thank you very much!

Plus:
I think it is related to what @Zane commented (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/can-the-ic-become-deflationary/16125/), this can help it to be truly deflationary in the event that the token drops a lot in price. Also @bjoernek was going to comment some related idea. Thank you very much !

My initial reaction is that this would be better if specified in cycles to match how people already think about storage costs, and also because it’s a better fit for a global platform.

I think you mean blackholed...but yeah..this could be a problem.  Also...why 0.01 and not .001?  There is something about transactions being less than a penny that is fairly appealing in the space.  I think $0.001 is still like 5000x more expensive than now.

Would it be respecting the value of 0.01 but expressed in cycles? What you would have to think about is in all the apps and exchanges out there, that value is not easily accessible to easily show the user how much the transaction will cost before sending it. How do you intend to resolve this point?

Good point... I thought that value for the current balance that occurs with the scenario of an ICP price of 100, on the other hand when lowering one from 0.01 to 0.001, what you produce is that you have to have values ​​of number of transactions exponentially larger so that this idea has a minimum impact. I think 0.01 is a good balance between low cost and impact (without having to have hundreds of millions of transactions)

Thank you all very much for your comments! It is good to continue the discussion, I think that it can be used to address this idea, whether to maintain it, modify it, or discard it... in any case, the discussion is positive. Thank you very much !

FranHefner | 2022-11-02 15:07:31 UTC | #7

I add to the comment above, if you see the table that I shared, you can see the case if it were worth USD 0.001 per transaction, it has practically no impact, even greatly increasing the number of transactions. (it would be equivalent to burning 0.01 but with the token worth $1000 and not $100)

Thx !!

IMHO, think and define the tokenomics through fiat, here the $, is problematic. What about the own fluctuations of the $, etc ? Let us stay in a decentralized and autonomous (conceptually) world : with ICP and Cycles.

-------------------------

steffen.icp | 2022-11-02 18:45:24 UTC | #9

I like the proposed idea:

* in order to scale, the IC needs to be easily accessible also to non-web3 developer
* non-web3 developer do not think in ICP (or ETH, or BTC,...), but in FIAT 
* the main challenge for any big chain is right now: 
=> if the chain becomes successful the tokens become expensive
=> if the tokens are expensive, the transactions become ridiculously expensive (see ETH, BTC transaction fees)

By setting the price per transaction in USD (or any other FIAT), the prices to run any service as a dev on ICP become much more predictable and less dependent on the costs of a coin. Additionally it is just way easier to grasp for non-web 3 developers in my opinion.

You are right that you are taking an external variable to determine a fee... But also in exhibitions all the time it refers to values ​​in dollars as a sample of what ICP is capable of. Example:
Storage / year $5 .
The nodes charge a sum in dollars that represent ICP but there you are also putting dollar value in tokenomics, it seems to me that we are always related.

Do you mean only changing the fee required when transferring ICPs to 0.01 USD? This seems to have some issues, for example when using the ICP for some operations, such as transactions in the NFT marketplace, if the marketplace charges 1% from 2 ICP worth of NFT transactions, is 0.01 USD too high of a transaction fee? Would it kill such transactions?

Hi @FranHefner, thank you sharing your idea and creating a detailed write-up!

As a quick feedback from my side 
* I see the benefit to linking the transaction fee to a predictable amount in fiat currency terms/cycles and also like the effect of an automatic stabilizer.
* As mentioned by @THLO the overall impact on tokenomics is (and should be) small (as transactions should be cheap and transaction fees are very small compared to node provider and voting rewards).

Thanks for comment! It's a good observation ! What would happen in the current scenario when the token is worth $100 or more?

Value: $100
$0.01  =>  0.0001 
Value $200
$0.02  =>  0.0001

Would you start killing from 0.01 and up? The market in ETH lived for a long time in POW and the transactions were worth hundreds of times more than $0.01 and nobody killed anybody... The market adapts. Entretop, I would review the charge and would not charge %1 if it is worth less than 1 ICP, I would find a way to sell it at 1 ICP + 0.01, then I would take it from there, there are many ways.

Thanks @bjoernek  for taking the time to read and comment! 

It is a small impact in current conditions, that would be positive!
The question is is it worth it?
If you look at the table, with eth or sol transactions, the market can never go down to those prices if we have that level of transactions because there would be less supply left and the price would increase. This would make it normalize the price to more reasonable values. ICP cannot work with values ​​less than 2 or 3 for a long time (due to inflation). And I think this would help not to get into that situation. Thx again !

Just in case it's not fully clear, the cost to run services (i.e., canisters) is measured in cycles, which are already tied to a basket of fiat currencies. Only ICP ledger transaction have a fee in ICP.

As I mentioned [before](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/scaling-transaction-fees/16257/2?u=thlo), and @bjoernek agrees, I don't think this change would have a tremendous impact on the burn rate.
However, this proposal has some appeal: In the current model, if the ICP price drops, the cost to run a denial-of-service attack goes down as well. Keeping the transaction fee fixed in fiat terms would mitigate this risk.
I'm not sure if this security concern is reason enough to change the current mechanism, though.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-03 15:15:50 UTC | #17

Businesses like to also be able to compute running costs precisely to determine profit models without unpredictability,even before starting the project. So keeping fee fixed in fiat terms will ease adoption in enterprise applications.

Thank you! @THLO 
Therefore, I can conclude that it will have no impact under current conditions (except for the possible enhancement of DDoS attacks).
But I can also assume that in the long term the proposal could work.

At the moment no negative points were found if I understood correctly. :white_check_mark:

We dismissed the impact on already deployed, blackholed canisters pretty quickly. Here is my case against this change:

1. Added latency
    * Depending on how the call is implemented, every canister will need to call out and check the SDR or USD conversion rate every time that ICP is transferred, or at least periodically. Extra canister calls will increase transaction latency by another 2-4 seconds for an already slow process.
2. Complexity
    * Transferring ICP is already a painful workflow (speaking as someone who has built on it). Dynamic fees adds another barrier to technical adoption
3. Backwards Compatibility
    * We encourage canisters that are responsible for transacting in ICP to remove all their controllers aside from the blackhole canister. Blackholed canisters will have the ICP ledger fee hardcoded, and will break (possibly irrecoverably) if dynamic pricing is introduced. 

I won't speak to the upsides of this proposal, but I think everyone should weigh them against the consequences to smart contracts that manage ICP

-------------------------

JxBrian | 2022-11-03 16:01:55 UTC | #20

There is a common phrase in the hood. “THE PRICE OF YESTERDAY IS NOT THE PRICE OF TODAY” 

How safe is setting the price in US dollars? Is that  price permanent of 1% of a dollar (0.01) or would that price change? 

Cycles make sense to me because they are somehow constant but ..0.01 hmmm doesn’t seem to add up to me.

Thanks for the answers ! 
Beginner questions.
1. 
Currently it is set that the transaction cost is 0.0001, that is not verified anywhere? why if you set a different value (daily or weekly) it would imply an increase in latency ?  if currently it also comes out somewhere that you have to burn 0.0001 per transaction.

2.When you talk about adoption, do you mean adoption for dfinity programmers to adapt the proposal or mass adoption of application developers? If what I told you about point 1 (an update every day/week) is applied, wouldn't it be transparent or more predictable than the current price that changes enormously every day?

3. The truth is that I don't have technical knowledge to ask you any questions on this point, I just wonder what happens in other blockchains where you have a dynamic burn for each transaction...

If I ask you in the long term, how much are you going to spend to make 1 million transactions and you have on the one hand a cost of 0.0001 ICP, vs a cost of USD 0.01. What would be an easier answer?

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-11-03 16:52:21 UTC | #22

Let's take a simple hypothetical - a canister that holds an ICP balance. Every time its method `disburse` is called, it sends its balance to a specific AccountId.

Today, that process is as simple as calling the ICP Ledger canister's `transfer` method with the following info: 
```
  public type TransferArgs = {
    memo : Memo;
    amount : Tokens;
    fee : Tokens;
    from_subaccount : ?SubAccount;
    to : AccountIdentifier;
    created_at_time : ?TimeStamp;
  };
```

Today, that flow would look like this: the canister calls the ICP ledger and checks its balance. **1 async call**.

Then, the canister knows everything it needs. The `memo`, `fee`, `from_subaccount` and `to` can all be hardcoded, and `created_at_time` is optional. The `amount` is whatever it has in its balance, minus `0.0001` ICP as the fee. The transfer will run, totalling **2 async calls**.

____ 

With this proposal, the fee becomes dynamic. We need to configure some sort of scheduled job to update the fee, and we also need logic for what to do in case the fee is wrong. The safest way to handle this would be to request the fee with each transfer, but that would make each update require **3 async calls** instead of 2. Instead, the more rational choice would be to cut out the check, and to either have additional costs from using the canister heartbeat feature, or to use an off-chain scheduling service to update the conversion rate.

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-11-03 16:56:52 UTC | #23

To answer your questions: 

1. Most canisters may have at best error handling for the price, but most will just have that number hardcoded today, because the number does not change in practice.

2. I mean adoption of application developers

3. I think that the mental model of "how much does this cost" to a layperson is different from an engineer. Simply put, a transaction costs `0.0001 ICP`. The smart contract doesn't need to care about fiat currency at all right now, because the units it transacts in are just tokens. `0.0001 ICP` is 100% predictable. It only has the appearance of fluctuating when you are comparing it to your wallet balance in Coinbase or whatever

I love it. Thank you for your hard work on this proposal! I will vote for this proposal, whether the final form ends up being articulated in cycles or in $USD. It helps reduce the possibility of a downward spiral in price and also prevents the he transaction fee from getting out of control at hypothetical higher prices.

Safety comes first and when I think about ICP.  Cheap alternatives tend to be more expensive in the long run…. FYI Usually I don’t respond more than twice without getting paid; to avoid going around in circles that’s just me. 

To answer your question, in order to prevent a rug & pull,  the dynamics of the network have to Match the market demand.  If ICP is hot obviously more is at stake so it would be expensive to transact, simple market dynamics.

Heihachi | 2022-11-03 19:40:37 UTC | #27

I like your idea but instead to change the fees, it is better to increase the number of transaction.
Approximately 10k transactions are 1 icp.

I agree with @skilesare that .001$ would be a better price for tx fees, it'd be way more expensive than the current one, while still being cheap and appealing, .01$ might not look like much but it quickly adds up when you're doing thousands of tx.

[quote="kpeacock, post:19, topic:16308"]

[/quote]

I agree with all your points, but imo this scenario could happen regardless in the future. Even with a fixed fee if the price of ICP pumps or dumps by orders of magnitude the NNS might decide to change the tx fee cost, e.g with 1k$ ICP hypothetical price 1tx would cost 0.1$, that's definitely way more than intended. 
So it might be preferable to promote asap better practices when handling tx fees and break a few canisters now rather than many in a few years.

Mathias | 2022-11-03 22:27:23 UTC | #30

I‘m building something requiring micro payments. Or at least rather small payments. 

Don’t underestimate the use cases that we could see related to small payments, I think it’s still unexplored territory. At least if I understand correctly a part of the intention behind this proposal is to make ICP payments more expensive simply to burn more, correct? 

I think it would send a bad signal. A mass coordinated effort to approach VCs would probably do more for the price than that.

I‘m also wondering how price increases will impact the transaction costs, like how scalable are ledger transactions exactly? I did not properly think about it running on a single subnet. I was assuming the fees would go up by less than on other chains due to horizontal scaling. Am I completely wrong about this?

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-11-03 22:36:30 UTC | #31

I believe $.001 per transaction is the same as the current burn at $10

If all devs needed to burn at least one ICP to get started we would already have had a large burn rate. Making a minimal burn rate for ICP should be much more feasible than a minimum transaction fee. 

extra perk: This ensures that the people making the canisters have at least 1ICP of vested interest in the site (no bots, mass-made phishing sites etc).

No it does not.. That is a common false assumption with 0 empirical evidence. Apple charges $99/yr to developers and they are doing fine. So do AWS, Heroku, any platform for devs.. moreover they are normally a lot more than $5 to deploy.

Actually with a 'cheap' price it can be viewed as an 'inferior good' which would dissuade the exact type of developers we would want to onboard.

-------------------------

Those platforms are established already, the IC isn't. Besides AWS and Heroku charge based on usage just like IC, don't they? Apple is the exception, but hey it's freaking Apple.

Plus you can't simply replicate their model, on the IC a single dApp can have hundreds/thousands of canister, whose creation already has a relatively high fee (0.1 XDR iirc), charging 1 ICP to create a canister will make TONS of use cases financially unfeasible. If you were to charge 1 ICP for the ability to create canisters, someone would create service to create canister and switch their ownership to bypass paying the 1 ICP fee. You can't do that on the Apple store or better yet I doubt many would do it cause as an account owner it'd mean a malicious app could get your account terminated and as developer it means fully entrusting your software in the hands of a 3rd party.

Our goal should be to make DX better and lower operational costs as much as possible, not do the opposite.

You misread - the minimal amount to make Cycles should be 1 ICP. Not to deploy, etc.
As a developer you need at-least $5 vested interest.

-------------------------

AWS and Heroku charge monthly and for usage.. there is a sunk cost to develop using them. Same with Apple but Apple is worse because they do not let you deploy apps without paying it.

hundreds/thousands of canister - what kind of service? It sounds fun 🤩 

-> If you were to charge 1 ICP for the ability to create canisters, someone would create service to create canister

That person would still need to burn a minimal 1 ICP to get Cycles.

-> Our goal should be to make DX better and lower operational costs as much as possible, not do the opposite.

Inferior goods demand decrease as income increase.. so high skill devs all around the world want to work with really cool new shit, that normally has a premium (Apple, AWS, Heroku, ETH, whatever). 

The perception of an instant ramen 'crypto' is the opposite of what we would like. This sounds contradictory but is based in solid economic theory which are also proven by the models of any other developer platform.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-11-04 01:14:04 UTC | #39

1) Cycle trading is a thing.

2) I don't see how that would be an improvement, even if it were enforceable. It's bad for DX, it doesn't stop bad actors from creating canisters and if ICP token increases in price it will only become a pointless barrier to entry, which is against the whole point of the IC.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2022-11-04 01:18:02 UTC | #40

You are inadvertently calling the economic models of AWS, Heroku, Apple, ETH, and other successful developer platforms wrong. 

There needs to be a minimal cost to reflect its status as a Veblen good. This attracts capable devs rather than dissuading them.

1. Cool if they need to trade Cycles great. It shows that they have an active interest in developing. Or they could just burn one ICP or whatever the 'minimal rate' is determined to be.

2. It does stop bad actors as they need to do extra steps or pay a minimum to do 'bad things'.

If I had to take an educated guess OpenChat comes to mind. They create 1 canister per user/chat.

He could burn many in bulk and sell them on a dex.

Respectfully disagree. The premium is there because the companies have the luxury to charge it as they dominate in their niche, as a dev when I see the 99$/year fee for Apple dev license I don't think "Man so premium", but "that's bullshit", but it's Apple and it owns a huge piece of the mobile market so i either play by their rules or don't play at all. 

The IC on the other hand is the laughing stock of crypto at the moment, I doubt adding more arbitrary walls will give outsiders a "premium feeling".

They can buy/sell cycles on the market and I doubt 5$ has ever stopped anyone from doing evil, I know guys who'd spend thousands just to DDOS Minecraft servers. It will stop many from taking the IC in consideration tho. 

This is my opinion, if you believe it's a good idea make a proposal.

-------------------------

apotheosis | 2022-11-04 02:56:01 UTC | #43

The premium comes from the fact that iPhone owners are also more likely than Android users to pay money for apps. It is a really good example of a 'luxury market' with a monopoly 😅 .

> as a dev when I see the 99$/year fee for Apple dev license I don’t think “Man so premium”, but “that’s bullshit”,

You may feel that way but after the sunk cost you are more likely to want to produce value with it. 
Last time I tried AWS they made me put in a card while signing up... ETH even requires that end-users pay per transaction which is insane. Using time to learn something or spending money creates stickiness.. 

I know of 100,000 'hello worlds' that could have been 100,000 burned ICP, which could help increase the price, which could help increase demand, if we do in fact make a luxury good.

This would also make marketing efforts like Hackathons more valuable. 5000 devs try IC and burn at least 5000 ICP doing it. It shows real demand.

For no (3), issue is that pricing in ICP may be predictable in the crypto world, but enterprises who account in fiat will find this cost very unpredictable. At USD 1000 per ICP, the price per transaction will be $0.1 USD which is quite expensive in enterprise terms. To attract enterprise applications we need to keep it predictable in fiat terms.

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-11-04 16:35:52 UTC | #45

Personally, I'm fine with a change that sets the rates against fiat as long as 

1. Transfers stay very cheap
2. The rate setting runs periodically, in a way that is designed to be predictable and accessible for canisters

[/quote]

With these 2 caveats the only downsides of this change that comes to mind are: breaking some blackholed canisters as previously stated and possibly introducing a scenario where long running transactions are rejected cause the fee initially approved is different from the up to date one, so devs will have to account for this edge case.

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-11-04 22:13:01 UTC | #47

In my ideal world, you would have a stable fee for a 1-week period, with 24-48 hour notice for the new price. There would also be a grace window where the old fee is still accepted after the new fee has been officially adopted

FranHefner | 2022-11-05 00:46:12 UTC | #48

Thanks for following the thread! so there is a hope that the proposal will not be discarded? We would have to wait for someone to explain the current model as it was thought, which I estimate went through several people before deciding how much a transfer would cost. We still need to know ( if it is possible), the research that was done to determine the price :open_book: Thank you! :raised_hands:

Maybe in a few days @diegop or @kpeacock could ask whoever did it or knows if it is possible to at least share a little bit of the research to find out :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-11-07 16:30:26 UTC | #49

My understanding is that we basically set it as low as we figured we could manage without hitting Denial of Service constraints. The cost of each transaction is essentially negligible to the network - the only constraint is the maximum throughput.

One of my first questions when I came onboard was "why can't we make it free?"

Can’t canisters be updated via NNS votes
[/quote]

being updated vis nns is not a good thing for a frozened canister. My main point is that the fee of a transaction may be designed as a dynamic parameter in the API...

I think it works and can compensate for ICP's poor economic model!
