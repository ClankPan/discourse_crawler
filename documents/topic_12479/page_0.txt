Thanks to the IPC Foundation for open sourcing the asynchronous, interactive, distributed ECDSA key generation scheme. If I understand correctly, the resharing scheme should allow resharing threshold shares to new sets of nodes (larger or smaller than the previous set) without changing the ECDSA public key. 

Do I understand correctly that reshares are produced from products of old shares? I haven't been able to understand the difference between masked and unmasked resharings, shown [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/c40033ecd1f9945e4a861f2f96a099786126cf85/rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/tecdsa/tests/test_utils.rs#L165). Are masked and unmasked defined somewhere? Is there an example in the code where a set of shares are reshared to a larger number of shares, where some nodes are new with no previously existing shares?

Thanks!

Masked and unmasked appear to be defined [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/35e277c83238774a4287b58398e8c875c36284e4/rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/tecdsa/src/lib.rs#L24).

A masked dealing is a Pedersen commitment, while an unmasked dealing is a discrete log commitment. 

This helps. Still attempting to find an example or understand the protocol for resharing to a larger set of shares with an increased threshold.

There was a really great survey [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1390.pdf) on this technology ... I think resharing is not that complex :

"When [sk] is already a Shamir sharing, the parties
simply generate a zero secret sharing which they add to
the existing secret."

This is section 4.2.

Thanks, this paper did help improve my understanding of what might be going on, but @victorshoup mentions in [this](https://youtu.be/MulbKPwv6_s?t=871) video as well as [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-ecdsa-signatures/6152/9?u=xander) post that none of the ECDSA threshold sharing protocols described in that paper satisfied their needs so they designed a new protocol. I couldn't find a description of the ECDSA threshold protocol that was decided upon.

@Manu mentioned:
> The full cryptographic details of the interactive DKG and threshold ECDSA signing will be published in a paper that should appear in the following weeks.

I just found the paper, it came out a couple of weeks ago, [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-ecdsa-signatures/6152/157?u=xander).

This is what I needed to understand what's going on, and I was able to reproduce resharing to a larger number of nodes. The key insights I was missing were:
- Lambda values can simply be created with the `Random` protocol
- The previous set of dealers can reshare to a larger number of recipients using the same protocol

Hi @xander Xander,

I'm interested in your work on resharing - could you possibly share the repository where this has been implemented? Your help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
