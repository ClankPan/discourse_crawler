## Introduction

Dear ICP Community,

We are excited to formally announce the upcoming decentralisation sale for [IC Footprint](https://owqnd-biaaa-aaaak-qidaq-cai.icp0.io/dashboard/projects), the native energy management and sustainability protocol for the Internet Computer network. Over the past two years, our team worked to both understand the environmental impact of ICP, and develop a platform to enable its decarbonisation. 

The launch of the IC Footprint SNS marks the next stage in the development of a climate tech industry on ICP. By open-sourcing our technology and enabling a framework for decentralised innovation, it is our firm belief that we can build the world’s most advanced green cloud computing network. This will benefit all network stakeholders by optimising network resource consumption, increasing the attractiveness of the network for SMEs and enterprises, and simplifying regulatory compliance. The attached whitepaper outlines our vision for achieving this and provides context as to the broader trends in the climate tech space that ICP can, and must, take advantage of. 

We invite you to join IC Footprint. This forum post is designed to collect feedback from the community in order to ensure a collaborative, and commercially driven approach to decarbonising ICP and Web3 more broadly. Your insight and participation are crucial for shaping the future of sustainable blockchain technology.

## Overview

**I. Climate Technology Super-Charged by ICP**

IC Footprint is the native energy management and sustainability protocol for the Internet Computer (IC) network, supporting decentralised applications (DApps), Service Nervous Systems (SNSs), Utopias, and node operators in measuring, reporting, and reducing their environmental impact. IC Footprint is an infrastructure play, deploying the foundational technologies to advance the IC’s green compute capabilities and create a climate tech industry on the network.

**III. Why Participate?**

1. Climate Tech Industry Opportunity: In Q4 2023, [€10Bn](https://dealroom.co/guides/climate-tech#:~:text=Investment%20by%20geography,-Climate%20tech%20VC&text=Europe%20held%20its%20best%20quarter,2020%20and%20any%20previous%20years.) was invested in climate tech solutions in Europe alone. Blockchain generally, and ICP specifically, have a central role to play in climate tech development, with on-chain solutions already emerging to solve crucial problems in the the energy transition and environmental commodity markets. IC FOOTPRINT will lead this vertical within ICP, unlocking exciting commercial opportunities along the way.

2. Governance: FOOTPRINT token holders will play a central role in shaping sustainability in Web3. From decision-making on strategic direction to influence over token incentives and project development, token holders sit at the core of IC FOOTPRINT operations.

3. Global Public Good: Climate change is one of the great challenges of the age, and will impact each of our lives. Novel technologies such as blockchain and AI are our greatest hope of limiting and reversing environmental degradation. Join a dedicated, experienced team and contribute to tackling this global issue.

**IV. Key Tailwind Trends**

1. Surging electricity demand from data centres, driven by AI and blockchain. Data centre driven electricity demand to triple in from 2.5 - 7.5% of US total by 2030 according to [BCG](https://cpowerenergy.com/demand-growth-offers-opportunities-for-data-centers/#:~:text=According%20to%20Boston%20Consulting%20Group,of%20the%20nation's%20total%20homes.) 

2. Growing renewable energy in grids increases the variability of tariff, grid load and grid carbon intensity, creating opportunities for optimisation and arbitrage [Energy Management Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_management_software) is increasingly important for managing variability and is a rapidly growing vertical with an estimated market size of £40+ billion.

3. Environmental regulations impacting enterprise cloud procurement requirements. [EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en) came into force in January, 2023.
5. The unfolding global climate crisis is influencing [consumer behaviour](https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change-support) and buying preferences.

**V. Key Takeaways**

1. Compute networks are intimately linked to the energy industry, which is digitising, expanding and becoming renewable simultaneously. Huge opportunities exist for cloud networks that can foresee and adapt to these changing fundamentals.

2. Implementing energy management systems and high-fidelity energy data analytics at the protocol level will reduce the cost of network operation, create revenue-generating products and enable network decarbonisation.

3. The IC technology stack can exploit new use cases to create novel products for commercialisation. IC Footprint is designed as a protocol to supercharge the development of IC native climate technology solutions, which can be commercialised within the ICP ecosystem, cross-chain, on Web2, and even with non-digital companies.

An excellent mission statement. Energy management and monitoring is global need that the IC platform could play a central role in if IC Footprint achieves its potential. Looking forward learning more!

Hello Icarus,

Thanks for the feedback. We'll be sharing more about the unique potential we see for building IC native energy management systems. What's more, we see huge potential in leveraging the IC technology stack as a USP as we move to commercialisation on other chains and verticals.

-------------------------

C12 | 2024-07-05 07:35:07 UTC | #4

This is an incredibly exciting announcement. I wholeheartedly support this initiative, and could not agree more that the decentralisation sale for IC Footprint represents a huge step towards building the world’s most advanced green cloud computing network. 

The focus on fostering a collaborative, and commercially driven approach to decarbonizing ICP and Web3 more broadly aligns perfectly with [C12's values](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/210), and I look forward to actively participating in this groundbreaking project.

Fantastic work @orlhut & the Carbon Crowd team!

-------------------------

aligatorr89 | 2024-07-16 21:41:57 UTC | #5

Hi IC footprint!
You are building the platform for trading with emissions and energy management. What is the primary reason for choosing icp? Like more community driven, less energy consumption, more robust infrastrcture?

-------------------------

orlhut | 2024-07-17 15:20:47 UTC | #6

Hello @aligatorr89, 

Great question. The answer is two-fold, with one part relating to Web3 more generally, and the second to ICP specifically. I'd also point you towards the [Advantages of Building on ICP](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ic-footprint-docs.appspot.com/o/ICF%20Whitepaper.pdf?alt=media&token=4c0aa974-4e8a-4153-809c-f4184ae10f58) section in the whitepaper, but I'll add some more colour below.

***

**ICP runs its own hardware**

This allows us to:

- gain real-time data from the host OS about energy consumption
- conduct 'perfect measurement' because we don't have the added abstraction layer of virtual machines
- understand with higher levels of certainty the grid the node is operating on

Taken together, this means our analytics are of higher quality, and crucially, that the IC can act as a 'first best customer'. In other words, we can build and test products directly on the IC, and then commercialise them on other chains, clouds and IOT networks. This approach would not be possible on other chain or cloud providers.

**Fully on-chain solution**

ICPs canister technology meant we can build our entire platform on-chain. In IC Footprint's first iteration, the goal was to build only an environmental commodity trading platform. We planned to use blockchain for a portion of the build, but leverage Web2 platforms alongside this. However, when we tried to understand the emissions of our platform on Web2 (we thought it was hypocritical to build a climate tech platform without understanding the impact of it), we saw that was going to be extremely difficult. At the same time, we'd need to trust the cloud providers that the figures they gave us were actually accurate.

This led us to begin shifting our entire tech stack onto ICP.

**Chainkey Technology**

Although this has only come into force more recently, we believe chainkey (ck) technology makes ICP an obvious choice for building a trading platform leveraging environmental commodities that are spread across Web2 and numerous different chains. Thanks to ck, we can provide a unified platform for all these environmental commodities in a single place.

***

I hope those give a little more context to our decision to build on ICP. As mentioned, head over to our whitepaper for more info, and happy to answer any other questions you have.

Hi @orlhut, was your platform not open-sourced before your announcement above or is this a new development?

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-07-18 19:40:15 UTC | #9

I've been quite busy and only just come across IC Footprint, so I'm playing catch up. Sounds like a very cool project, but I don't understand that late timing on open-sourcing the code. How is anyone supposed to perform proper due diligence with these timescales. Please correct me if I'm missing something :)

Here's a relevant comment on FuelDAO's SNS attempt.
[quote="ld-dfn1, post:20, topic:31481"]
the github link, it was only shared with the proposal submission instead of during the community syndication phase (missing the prescribed guidelines). In the future we would be **declining proposals that do not adhere strictly** to the timeline prescribed in the voting guidelines
[/quote]

In IC Footprint's case, the github link wasn't even shared with the proposal (nor at the time of the submission), but days later.

I'm inclined to reject on these terms, unless someone points out that I'm missing something. I think the project sounds great. But there's not time to look into the details properly, which I think is a must.

-------------------------

orlhut | 2024-07-18 19:43:05 UTC | #10

Hello @Lorimer,

The majority of the repo's were open-sourced for the duration and were reviewable in the github link of the original post. The final one is now also open-sourced, but I thought I'd just repost them all for convenience.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-07-18 19:53:53 UTC | #11

[quote="orlhut, post:1, topic:32724"]
Off-chain code will be open-sourced at the moment of NNS Proposal
[/quote]

Could you point out which repo's were closed-source until the 'moment of the NNS Proposal'?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2024-07-19 14:34:18 UTC | #12

Dear @orlhut and team,

Thank you for your work on IC Footprint and your proposal to create an SNS for the project. IC Footprint is an established project in the ecosystem and has been part of the DFINITY Developer Grants.

On behalf of DFINITY, I need to communicate that DFINITY will reject this proposal because the code was not publicly shared during the syndication phase, but only a day after the proposal was sent to the NNS. This leaves too little time for the community to review the code.

The notice that DFINITY will reject in this case has been communicated recently:

[quote="ld-dfn1, post:20, topic:31481"]
While the team did share the init file and the github link, it was only shared with the proposal submission instead of during the community syndication phase (missing the prescribed guidelines). In the future we would be declining proposals that do not adhere strictly to the timeline prescribed in the voting guidelines.

We wish the team well on their continued journey of building IC Footprint.

frederico02 | 2024-07-20 12:01:23 UTC | #13

I don’t think I quite understand. What exactly will FOOTPRINT do? Monitor energy usage for different projects?

-------------------------

ajmoose | 2024-07-21 22:42:02 UTC | #14

Is this just monitor to make recommendations? I would like clarification, this is not going to try and set any governance for anything other than IC Footprint. What is the plan once you have metrics and data on hardware and consumption? If its for informational usage that is good but if it is anything but that and tries to impact or bypass the community in any way with changes that are presented without IC Footprints name on proposals that is a break in trust. I am currently busy with limited daily internet. I would be nice to have a list of what's good and bad from both sides, those that  oppose and those that are for it. We should have a category page that hosts both sides of the conversations for people that are on time crunches to get a pros and cons from opposing sides.
