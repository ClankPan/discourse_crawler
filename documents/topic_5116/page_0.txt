I am aware that BigMap is not out yet, and sudograph by @lastmjs is still limited to one canister. 
What are production sites doing right now? Dscvr.one: in general what is the database used there?

How fun :grinning: . I will probably do a data canister layer ad hoc. If I give users an id to remember, that id could tell me which data canister their data resides in; like an area code. When scaling I will make the new people have a new area code.

Are you using Motoko or rust ?

My project is up on IC. Mostly doing FE now but am starting on BE, and plan on using Motoko.

Currently DSCVR is built in Rust.  I believe IC applications wont be built in one language, will about the right tool for the job.

I an interested in knowing the plan when data grows outside of the one canister.
