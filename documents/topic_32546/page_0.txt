Is there a reason that dfx requires authentication/password when doing a build. I understand the deploy but it can get tedious when doing it over and over again.
Or if anyone know any tricks with WSL2 like a keychain

No reason. [PR to fix it](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/3813).

Workaround until it's in a release: `dfx --identity anonymous build`
