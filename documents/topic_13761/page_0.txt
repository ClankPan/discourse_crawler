So this might be a dumb question but I still wanted to get some advices from people working in IC develops.
I am currently studying in second year of my University. I would like to learn knowledge about developing on IC, there is thing like Motoko playground and some documents about it...However I found it hard to understand and digest. 

I have studied some basic of Rust/C++ in the past, and I am informed that I could use Rust on IC developing directly,but I kind of confused with how to deploy my code(for example a little calculator) on IC?

Is there any sequences of learning ,like tutorial videos or practice question bank....but it's about developing skills on IC?
