Now there is a huge problem in EVM ecosystem that tokens between L2s cannot move easily. Someone is trading a meme coin in Base cannot quickly move liquidity to trade another meme coin in Optimism. They have to swap to ETH/USDT, bridge to OP to trade. Every step there is gas fees. This problem causes EVM ecosystem running behind SOL. I assume Chain Fusion tech can ck every ERC20 on any EVM chain now? If someone can build a ckEVM dex to let people trade different meme coins across all L2s GAS FREE, this could be huge.

Two questions:
1. Is this technically possible? ie ck ERC20 from Base?
2. Are you aware any project in IC trying to do this?
