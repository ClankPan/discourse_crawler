Hello,

I am trying to reference the treasury account of OpenFPL for topping up the cycles wallet but I have the following error:

![image|690x332](upload://wqkGZCrzwKg0eV4THjnxglmp5V.png)

So on footballgod (another app I use) I do the same thing but have no problem referencing Self.

Any help greatly appreciated, here is the link to the file:

I believe the problem is that the actor is invoking `setCheckCyclesWalletTimer` as part of its initialisation code (line 419), which passes the function `checkCanisterWalletBalance` to `Timer.setTimer`. That function, however, when called, ultimately ends up trying to call `getTreasuryAccount`, which needs `Self`. And Motoko cannot know what `Timer.setTimer` is doing with the function it's given, conservatively it must assume that it might try to call it right away, which would hit the incompletely initialised `Self`.

So you'll need to stage the initialisation of the timer somehow to resolve this.

You are a legend. 

Yeah I just need to initialise that through a function, I really appreciate the assist.
