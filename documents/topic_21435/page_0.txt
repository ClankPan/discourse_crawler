Modclub is preparing to launch its SNS DAO and expects to begin the decentralization sale soon.

This forum serves as an opportunity for the IC community to discuss the Modclub SNS and ask questions.

Modclub’s mission is to support IC dApps by handling resource-intensive tasks like moderation, verification, data labeling, and more. Modclub provides the IC with fast, accurate, and scalable solutions by leveraging advanced technologies and a global community-driven workforce. Modclub is built fully on-chain, and the first SaaS model application on the IC!

Please refer to the [proposal summary](https://github.com/modclub-app/modclub/blob/main/sns/sns_proposal_summary.md) and [Modclub whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/kuxk6x5pghemyrje) for more details.

The tokenomics paper and fully open-sourced code will be released later this week, and the updated links can be found in the [proposal summary](https://github.com/modclub-app/modclub/blob/main/sns/sns_proposal_summary.md).

It is recommended to review these documents before asking questions, as they may already contain answers.

I've been a moderator on the platform for a while, although I am not very active, I'm looking forward to being able to earn MOD tokens instead of points. 
I think Modclub will be a much needed project for dApps in the ecosystem. Good luck team.

The road to freedom of thought is ancient, and will likely never end - but we haven't arrived at the Status Quo of today by accident - people have participated, learnt and shared their experiences for the betterment of all. 

ModClub presents us all with the opportunity to understand the requirements for safeguarding basic human freedoms across decentralised products and services.

IMO, there is a huge and worrisome gap between the Right to Free Speech and the understanding this is a privilege that comes with Responsibilities.

Hi, thank you all for your support! We have an update we just added our SNS configuration to the proposal summary.

Disclaimer: This post reflects my personal opinion as part of my role as CTO for FPDAO.

Flower Power DAO used Modclub [for PoH to guard access](https://github.com/flowerpowerdao/poh) to the Punks NFT sale. It was a very smooth experience integrating with Modclub thanks to the SDK they provided and there were almost 4k principals being whitelisted, having to solve numerous challenges to get rid of bots. 
All of this was accomplished without any hiccups and showed that the vision of independent canisters interacting with each others services is a reality today already.
I personally think Modclub is a great example of a SaaS business built on the IC and look forward to their decentralisation!

Thank you for the proposal. You mentioned that you will utilize the latest SNS canisters, and they will be public. 

Can you please provide more information on the technical architecture of the canisters? Have you tested the canisters that you plan on using?

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-26 14:57:31 UTC | #8

Hi @jennifertran 

Thank you for the excellent question.

Our platform's architecture is arranged into canisters, each with a distinct role, which contributes to the smooth operation of Modclub. Here's a more detailed description:

1. **Vesting Canister**: This canister manages the temporary holding of moderator tokens. These tokens empower moderators with voting rights and the ability to claim rewards.
2. **Reputation Canister**: This canister is in charge of monitoring and managing both reputation points and seniority of moderators, keeping track of their status and contributions.
3. **Main Modclub Canister**: As the backbone of our platform, it contains all the essential business logic of our platform. This includes task moderation, proof-of-humanity (POH), and more.
4. **Security Canister**: The safety of the platform is paramount, and this canister handles all matters related to security and permissions.

The security-related checks within our platform are handled by message inspection across all canisters. Moreover, we employ a system message-bus (Publish-Subscribe model) which permits operations such as processing of heavy-duty tasks and real-time updates to occur asynchronously. This enhances the efficiency of our platform, especially under high-load conditions.

As for testing, we follow a layered approach with several different levels:

1. **Unit Testing**: Each individual component of the software is tested to ensure it functions as expected in isolation. This includes methods, functions, or even individual canisters.
2. **Integration Testing**: Once the units have been individually tested, we then examine how they work together. This layer focuses on the interaction between different parts of the software.
3. **E2E Testing**: At this layer, we assess the system as a whole. This includes all the canisters and their interactions and verifies that the entirety of Modclub functions as designed.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: The final layer of testing, ensures the software meets all requirements and is ready for deployment.

Currently, we perform testing related to SNS on our QA environment. You will be able to check everything in detail in our public repository which will be published soon.

Edit: Updated wallet canister description.
Edit2: Wallet canister is only used now for testing internally. It is not deployed as part of the SNS launch.

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2023-07-20 05:01:06 UTC | #9

Thank you for the detail, I'm looking forward to reviewing the code on your public repo. Also, do you have any plans on conducting a security audit?

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-20 19:37:45 UTC | #10

As part of our security strategy, we have already engaged with an external contractor to perform an in-depth security audit of our project. This includes a thorough analysis of the codebase, infrastructure, and all critical components that comprise our system.

Following the results from the audit, we've implemented a comprehensive security layer to enhance the protection of our platform. Our security architecture is designed to address both common threats as well as sophisticated, targeted attacks that could potentially affect the stability and integrity of our system. The aim here is to create a resilient and secure environment that can withstand adversarial attempts while providing a seamless and secure experience for our users.

In addition to these measures, we also believe in the power of the open-source community in helping maintain and improve the security of our project. Similar to Hot Or Not, we will also introduce a bug bounty program. This initiative will incentivize the community to uncover and report any overlooked security flaws, making it a win-win scenario for everyone involved. 

Rest assured, we are committed to continuous improvement and regular audits to ensure the highest level of security. We understand that security is not a one-time achievement, but rather an ongoing commitment to protect our users and their information.

Any info about tokenomics?

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-21 14:31:44 UTC | #12

Hi @Heihachi 

A link to the tokenomics can be found in the [proposal summary](https://github.com/modclub-app/modclub/blob/main/sns/sns_proposal_summary.md) at the bottom under Notes.

modclub | 2023-07-22 18:44:23 UTC | #13

Hello everyone,

We're thrilled to announce that the source code for Modclub, is now available! Find it [here](https://github.com/modclub-app/modclub_src).

This release embodies our commitment to openness, collaboration, and innovation. 

Please note that a small part of the code, related to wallets, is undergoing final audit and will be made available within the next 3-4 days.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2023-07-24 12:19:22 UTC | #14

I can't wait to see this go live. Modclub has been one of my favourite token ecosystems projects to watch. Raheel and his team have done a great job of synthesising all the lessons from incentivised community engagement projects of the past and applying them to a service-based business. It already has demonstrated whitelisting services provided to Flower Power DAO and a ton of other NFT projects. It's among the most solid web 3 services with applicability to the Web 2 world out there.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-07-24 12:25:56 UTC | #15

The only one project so far 100% legit, clear as daylight with info to cover all interested from IC OG's  and newcomers to the space. 
Marks the most points laid out by Dfinity in the SNS launch check list. Glad to see you here.
You got our votes. 
God bless.

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-25 03:54:31 UTC | #17

We are delighted to announce that we have created the proposal to whitelist the Modclub Foundation principal ID in preparation for our SNS launch. This marks another exciting step towards decentralization. We thank you for your continued support!

Hello everyone,

Our proposal progress is looking positive. We wanted to share that we have updated our [white paper](https://docsend.com/view/hdj9zkhnnbd3n2sy) with an architecture overview and dependencies. We have also provided the remaining source code in the public repo [here](https://github.com/modclub-app/modclub_src)

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2023-07-26 21:01:02 UTC | #19

Thank you so much! Have you tested the SNS functionality? Any results from testing the source code?

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-26 21:23:27 UTC | #20

Hi @jennifertran Yes we are actively testing Modclub using the SNS testflight. The following have been tested:

* SNS configuration and deployment
* Proposal creation to allow SNS to become the controller of all canisters
* Canister upgrade proposal and execution
* Function proposal creation and function proposal execution.

The forum posts and support from Dfinity have been very helpful in setting up and testing the SNS functionality. We will be sure to request support when we encounter issues.

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2023-07-26 21:27:18 UTC | #21

Great, please let us know if you run into any issues and when you complete other tests and are confident that you are done with all necessary testing.

Hi Modclub Team,

I like the proof of humanity concept. all the best for your SNS. Meantime what's your revenue model?

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-27 15:00:02 UTC | #23

Hi,

Thank you for the kind words. You can find further details in our [white paper](https://docsend.com/view/hdj9zkhnnbd3n2sy)

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-07-31 01:21:12 UTC | #24

We're incredibly grateful for the support from the community on the whitelisting proposal. Your positive feedback via the forum and social media truly matters to us.

We're making a slight adjustment to our [tokenomics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/175y0SuA6zDnGq4yFhl0AcHQr0-jVh11xjRsVIhDc8zc/edit?usp=sharing). The maximum dissolve delay, previously 4 years, is now 1 year. This move enables us to phase out founder adjustments, ensuring greater decentralization of our DAO.

Thank you for your continued support.

-------------------------

MrBennyP | 2023-08-03 02:22:54 UTC | #25

Modclub is the real deal.  The IC community needs proof of humanity and they're taking the bull by the horns.

Keep up the great work, if it's not clear as day....you have my vote.

modclub | 2023-08-04 18:37:54 UTC | #26

Hi everyone,

We are thrilled to share with you that we have reserved 2% of our tokens for airdrop. If you've been checking our [SNS dashboard for Modclub](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/w7g63-nqaaa-aaaaq-aabca-cai), you might have noticed that the total tokens do not yet amount to 1B MOD. The reason for this is simply because these tokens are still in the pipeline, yet to be minted.

As soon as the SNS swap is complete, these tokens will be minted through a proposal and distributed to our funded holders, existing moderators, and other airdrop recipients. We are working on the precise distribution details and amounts, and we are excited to share this information with you soon. Please stay tuned to our [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/ModclubApp) feed and Discord for these updates.

Thank you for your continuous support!

Cheers, Modclub Team

Important update for the community!

Hi everyone, 

We’ve run into an issue with the SNS Proposal Launch. You may notice that there are multiple Modclub SNS Proposals up. We were told that only one proposal could go through at a time and that it was first come first serve. Modclub had multiple nodes running using separate neuron Ids to submit our proposal at the deadline of EMC's proposal. And it seems like the NNS allowed multiple to go in at the same time. 

We have reached out to Dfinity and will work to resolve the issue.

For voting purposes please use Proposal 123929
https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=123929

I didn't realize the queue is so crammed to require scripting proposals (Valid only for SNSes requesting funds from NF).
Dfinity can't do much more than what they just did - rejecting proposals except one:

Hi everyone,

We want to thank Dfinity for quickly confirming and addressing the bug that led to multiple Modclub proposals. Their team has taken immediate action to reject all but proposal 123929. 

**Please use proposal 123929** **if you would like to cast your vote**: [https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=123929](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=123929)

We thank you for your patience as Dfinity works towards fixing this bug in their system.

modclub | 2023-08-10 16:51:29 UTC | #33

Hi everyone,

Modclub launched a proposal to allow [Modclub to Resume SNS Token Swap Proposal after multiple OpenSnsTokenSwap bug fix is implemented](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=123978).

This NNS proposal is to enable Modclub to resume our SNS Token Swap Proposal where we were interrupted by the NNS bug.

On Monday August 7th, Modclub discovered a [bug in the NNS](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/bug-with-multiple-open-swap-proposals-for-the-same-project/21983) which allowed multiple proposals to be live simultaneously, this should not have been possible.

Modclub was to proceed with proposal 123929, which would have been successfully closed by Thursday August 10th, at 8:40 am EST. But when the additional proposals were rejected an automatic cleanup mechanism was triggered, and our SNS was put into an invalid state.

As a result Modclub had to restart the whitelisting process to resume the SNS Swap Proposal. This whitelisting has been successfully executed for [Proposal 123956](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=123956).

For more details on the NNS bug and the mechanisms that rendered our existing swap proposal invalid, please read Dfinitys forum post [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/multiple-opensnstokenswap-proposals-update/21994).

Modclub Team

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-08-10 18:51:29 UTC | #34

Hey @modclub would you please clarify further why this [proposal 123978](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123978) is necessary?  Do you really need to wait for the NNS bug to be fixed?  You already have a working automation to submit your SNS proposal.  If you only submit 1 proposal instead of 14 proposals then you won’t trigger the bug again.  Why not just respectfully request that the other SNS projects not try to compete to be next in line, which they would only be able to do if they also automate their submission?    Have you asked @Seers @atomikm @icpmaximalist @EMCprotocol about their intentions and are any of them actively trying to race to be next in line?  It seems more palatable to ask them to show you courtesy than asking DFINITY, or anyone else, to vote no to an SNS proposal just because they submit their proposal before you.  What am I missing about why you made this request via Governance proposal?

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-08-10 19:25:05 UTC | #35

Hi happy to answer all your questions!

Dfinity has explained that if we submitted a single proposal, the bug could still be triggered if another SNS project submitted their proposal concurrently.

We had an opportunity to resubmit today as no other teams have their SNS up. But [Dfinity voted to pause SNS Proposals](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-update-august-7-2023/21992 ) until the bug is fixed. 

As you know our SNS Proposal was made invalid due to this NNS bug. 

We've proposed a queueing system in a previous [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-suggestion-implementation-of-a-queueing-system-for-sns-dao-proposals/21969) and have reached out to other teams to collaborate. We’ve talked to the BOOMDAO team, they have been really great, and are happy to coordinate proposal submission order. However, not all teams have responded yet, which could still lead to potential issues.

Our proposal is a formal attempt to establish that queue. It's not intended to disadvantage other projects but to facilitate orderly process. And allow us to continue our SNS Swap that was already in progress. From a technical perspective this issues should not have happened as we confirmed with Dfinity multiple times before we submitted the initial SNS proposal on Monday. 

We hope this answers all your questions!

Modclub Team

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-11 06:03:10 UTC | #36

We're okay with letting them go next.

-------------------------

modclub | 2023-08-12 16:15:15 UTC | #37

All projects moving towards the SNS have agreed to allow Modclub to resume the SNS Proposal process after Dfinity fixes the NNS bug. Thanks to BOOM DAO (@icpmaximalist, @atomikm) @Seers , and @EMCprotocol! 
We believe in implementing a queuing system to streamline SNS setup and make resource allocation and project planning more manageable, making the process more developer-friendly.
