Following up on https://forum.dfinity.org/t/agent-js-0-10-0/6315, agent-js 0.10.0 is out today. This was my last big API refactor planned for the time being, and developers can expect `0.10.x ` to be a stable minor version for a while. 

I've also added a changelog to https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app, which I'll be keeping up to date with future releases.
