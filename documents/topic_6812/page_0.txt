It's really great to see the status information here: https://status.internetcomputer.org/

And I love knowing about the incidents that are reported, the expected downtime, when they're fixed etc.

What I am very curious to know per incident (and probably others as well) is exactly what went wrong and how the fix is implemented. Detailed post-mortems for these events would be very nice to have, considering the novelty of this network, the purported security and scalability properties, etc. Post-mortems would really help the community to assess the security and robustness of the network, how susceptible it is to certain attacks or faults, how fixes are truly implemented, etc.

Dear Jordan, we currently complete post-mortems for every network issue of a certain severity. Sharing the reports with the community is a great idea. We will look into it and let you know. Emma
