Is there a way to test with this restriction removed other than recompiling without the offending line?  As the team works to remove the restriction, perhaps we could get some test wasms built and stashed somewhere?

Edit: It looks like there are only a few places that need to be updated. If I pull those out, how can I compile the nns governance canister given I've cloned the repo.
