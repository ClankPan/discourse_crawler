I noticed CanCan rewards users with points, which can then optionally be converted to governance tokens.

Something similar with DSCVR, which separates social tokens from service tokens. I'm not sure if only one, or both, will eventually be listed on an exchange.

What's the benefit of these "dual token" architectures? Why not just have a single token?
