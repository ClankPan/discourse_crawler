Hello,

I'm representing Jagad and am thrilled to announce our ICP grant project. The ICP Sub-Account Indexer is a powerful tool for managing ICP sub-accounts on the Internet Computer.

### Our Journey

We aimed to create a reliable tool to efficiently track and manage ICP token transfers. Through continuous development, we've built a robust system that enhances user control and security in handling ICP sub-accounts.

### Key Features of ICP Sub-Account Indexer

**Subaccount Management**: Add and manage subaccounts effortlessly, ensuring privacy and security through SHA224 encryption for unique subaccount IDs.

**Transaction Tracking**: Efficiently lists and clears transactions, allowing users to keep track of all activities within their subaccounts.

**Fund Sweeping**: Automatically sweep funds from subaccounts to a main user vault, simplifying fund consolidation and management.

### On-Chain Advantages

The ICP Sub-Account Indexer operates on a decentralized network, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing security. Users benefit from full control over their data and assets in a transparent and auditable environment.

### Technical Overview

- **Languages**: Rust
- **Canister Methods**: Add subaccounts, list transactions, clear transactions, sweep funds, issue refunds, retrieve canister status

### Design Highlights

Our design leverages SHA224 encryption to derive unique subaccount IDs, ensuring efficient batch processing of transactions. This approach guarantees scalability and performance without compromising security.

#### Sequence Flow

To illustrate how the ICP Sub-Account Indexer works, we've created a sequence diagram to visualize the integration process for your app.
