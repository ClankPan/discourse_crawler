installed dfx 0.15.1 on my wsl2 on my new computer, ran 
"dfx new hello_world"
"cd hello_world"
"dfx start --background"
"dfx deploy"
deployed, backend canister candid interface works but not front-end, throws error idon't remember.
did this sequence more than once, but now whenever im either trying to deploy or install canisters console freezes and after a while it throws a time out error 
```

that's an example while trying to deploy

Sounds like it could be a WSL issue... To debug, can you please put this in your `dfx.json` and see if you notice any errors in the replica's output? It probably helps to run the replica in a different terminal

```
  "defaults": {
    "replica": {
      "log_level": "info"
    }
  },
  "networks": {
    "local": {
      "bind": "127.0.0.1:4943"
    }
  },

```

now i'm running dfx in a separate terminal
```
dfx deploy

And do you get any interesting outputs from the `dfx start` terminal?

-------------------------

no
so i just reinstalled wsl and now it's again working, backend canister candid interface working just fine but front-end says "not found", however i noticed that when i do "npm install" i get an error, how important is this step?

this is the error
```

Nice! Glad to hear that's working

[quote="MotoshiNakasato, post:5, topic:24640"]
but front-end says “not found”, however i noticed that when i do “npm install” i get an error, how important is this step?
[/quote]

If the frontend can't be built, either because the dependencies can't be installed or because the build itself fails, then there is no frontend to be uploaded, so I would even _expect_ to get 'not found'

it keeps happening spontaneously btw... i can't keep reinstalling the WSL every time

That looks very wrong... But I don't see how I can reproduce this. Can you maybe try the new 0.15.2-beta.0 of dfx? Maybe the replica included in that works better?
