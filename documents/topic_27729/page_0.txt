I have a wallet create using dfx.
I sent IC to it, I see it has a balance
I try to run `dfx deploy --network ic` and get an error "In order to create a canister on this network, you must use a wallet in order to allocate cycles to the new canister"
then it says to remove the "no-wallet" argument and try again, but I didn't have the no-wallet argument.

I have a funded account - well I thought I did, I tried  "dfx wallet balance --network ic" tells me "failed to setup wallet caller. no wallet configured for combination of identity icdev and network ic)"

`dfx ledger balance --network=ic` does show a balance

How do I deploy my canister from the dfx command line?

Dfx (intentionally) does not automatically use your ICP. You can set up a cycles wallet like described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-wallet#creating-a-cycles-wallet-on-the-mainnet). Once that is set up you can `dfx deploy`
