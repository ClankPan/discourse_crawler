If you have updated to the latest version `0.4.10`, the template html is loading and you get the "Enter your name" prompt, but there seems to be no feedback after that, make sure you visit `localhost:8000` and not `127.0.0.1:8000`. The latter doesnt serve the response from the actor for me.

There is a bug right now that made it through, unfortunately. We don't wait for enough time from the client and timeout in the frontend. We have a fix ready. You could fix it yourself but that would require modifying the (minified) userlib.

Instead we will likely do a 0.4.11 with this single fix before the new year. Otherwise most (if not all) your calls will fail. I think queries should be slightly more stable but might also fail a lot.

`0.4.11` is just out the oven and solves the call. You should use localhost which should work with this new version. Alexa will post the notes soon :)
