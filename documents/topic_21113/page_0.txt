This exciting initiative represents a crucial milestone in our efforts to provide a robust and versatile trading environment. The LBP model offers a novel approach to project fundraising, providing fair and efficient price discovery. 

Our inaugural LBP launched today at 12:00 PM UTC, featuring a limited supply of 100,000 tokens and a 20X bonus for the first pool. The mechanism and user experience of our LBP will be familiar to those who've previously used ETH platforms. This is the dawn of a new era in ICP token launches, and we are thrilled to be leading the way. 

LBP will be soon permissionless and open-source. It's currently using a multi-canister architecture for enhanced scalability and performance. 

Join us in this journey, and let's revolutionize the ICP DeFi landscape together.
