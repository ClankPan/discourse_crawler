I hear often that the boundary nodes are a major point of centralization for the IC. I’ve witnessed firsthand the effects that one faulty boundary node had on the entire network.
Months ago, one boundary node went down and it left a large portion of IC users unable to access any app built on the ic for the entire time that the node was down. I’m curious if there are any more key infrastructures that are also centralized (as in the case of the boundary node infrastructure) and where is the progress being tracked with regard to decentralizing these infrastructures?
