Introducing EA Kazi, Elevating freelancing with trust and verifiability
A decentralized synergy of Fiver and Udemy providing a verifiable and trust system for the Web3 GIG Economy built on ICP.

Project Highlight:

EA Kazi innovatively merges the functionalities of Fiverr and Udemy within the Web3 Gig Economy, offering a verifiable and trustworthy system for freelancers and clients. Notably, it provides freelancers with free training opportunities, with payment deferred until after securing gigs, facilitated by NFT certificates. Trainers also receive lifelong royalties whenever their issued certificates are used to secure jobs.

Web3 Advantages:

Utilizing Web3 technology, EA Kazi ensures transparency, immutability, and decentralization, empowering users with greater control over their data and transactions. Smart contracts on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) automate agreements, enhancing security and efficiency.

How It's Built:

EA Kazi leverages the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to host its decentralized application, ensuring scalability and resilience. Smart contracts facilitate secure and automated transactions, while NFT certificates enable freelancers to access training for free and pay royalties upon gig acquisition.

Internet Computer Protocol Superpowers

Hosting directly on the internet via ICP grants EA Kazi unparalleled accessibility and scalability. This eliminates reliance on traditional web hosting services, enhancing the platform's reliability and reach within the Web3 ecosystem.Also the use of the Internet Identity makes the streamlined process to be fully decentralized

Go-to-Market Strategy:

EA Kazi employs community engagement, strategic partnerships, and targeted marketing to reach freelancers, clients, and stakeholders. Social media, developer communities, and industry events are leveraged to establish EA Kazi as a leading platform in the decentralized gig economy.

Monetization

Revenue streams include transaction fees, premium features, and partnerships. Additionally, tokenization and governance mechanisms incentivize participation and value creation. Trainers receive lifelong royalties for NFT certificates used to secure jobs.

Status of the Project:

Currently in the beta stage, EA Kazi focuses on enhancing features, security, and user experience. Continuous testing and iteration are prioritized to ensure a robust platform at launch. Also with plans to integrate ckBTC and ckETH as payment gateways with off-ramp features allowing freelancers to earn in top currencies and convert with ease.

Future Plans

EA Kazi aims to expand its user base, onboard more freelancers and clients, and diversify service offerings. Integration of additional Web3 technologies, such as decentralized identity and DeFi features, will further enhance the ecosystem and value proposition.

EA Kazi at the moment has fully integrated the IC on flutter mobile and it's beautiful! It took us months to achieve this and probably the first time this is done. Anticipate!
