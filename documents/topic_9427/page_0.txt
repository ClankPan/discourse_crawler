I swear I was able to access `this` in the actor body before. Now I'm getting a 

```
cannot use this before this has been defined
```

You can use `this` inside a method, but not in the initialisation expression of an actor's state variable â€“ at that point, the actor itself is not yet defined (same as with objects). It always was like that.

I'm afraid you'll have to initialise the variable from within a method somehow.
