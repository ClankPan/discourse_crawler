## Doxa

Doxa is a multistablecoin plartform with the doxadollar

The Doxa Dollar is groundbreaking stablecoin leveraging the power of the Internet Computer to provide a stable, decentralized, and secure stablecoin while addressing the need for a native stablecoin coin on ICP.

It is backed up 1:1 to the US dollar and over-collateralized by cKUSDC in the stability pool.

**How it works**

Doxa dollar is backed up 1:1 to the US dollar and over-collateralized by cKUSDC in the stability pool.

For each Doxa Dollar minted equal USD amounts of the reserve asset (ckUSDC) is stored in a canister.

The stability pool ensures that there is an excess supply of ckUSDC and maintains the doxa dollar peg at $1, even when the prices of USDC go below $1. This is done through depositing more ckUSDC in the reserve pool when the prices of USDC are below the $1 and withdrawing ckUSDc from the Reserve pool when the prices of USDC are above $1.
