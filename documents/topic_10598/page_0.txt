Dear IC Community,

we are happy to announce [a new replica version](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/e00f758c89d5c37b794dec308c0444a99ac1e9f7) that will get proposed to be elected within the next 48 hours.
The release notes are as follows:

```
* Consensus: Cache finalized chain
* Consensus: Continue to attempt to validate a block even when an invalid notarization is found
* Consensus: Slow consensus down when the gap between finalization and the last cup gets too large
* Consensus: Use BTreeSet to ensure share signatures are deduplicated when aggregating
* Crypto: Add BIP32 key derivation for Threshold ECDSA
* Crypto: Add ZK proofs of equality, product, and for MEGa
* Crypto: Optimize the Threshold ECDSA protocol
* Crypto: PublicCoefficients::lagrange_coefficients_at_zero should reject duplicate inputs
* Crypto: Use random number generator from CSP instead of OpenSSL for TLS keygen
* Execution: Add invariants checks in scheduler
* Execution: Enable canister sandbox
* Execution: Handle all syscalls in sandbox
* Execution: Register callbacks within sandbox
* Execution: Registering canisters metric at the end of loop based on executed canister list
* Networking: Use dedicated OS threads for peer flows
* Node: Mark orchestrator and replica as permissive domains
* Node: SELinux policy for canister sandbox
* Node: SSH and replica AVC denial fixes
* Orchestration: Implemented node re-assignment
* Various bugfixes and test updates
```
[The rollout of the current version](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/release-notes-for-new-replica-version-50ead/10340) went well as expected and will be finalized today by the upgrade of the NNS subnet.

This rollout is a bit bumpy. Yesterday we had [a code yellow incident](https://status.internetcomputer.org/incidents/brw0c81vn56m) that we needed to [patch](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/42783) today. We could identify issues with all subnets that have a higher load. The sandboxing feature that we tried out last week on a subnet with a mid-level load caused suspicious memory utilisation patterns on subnets with a higher load. We want to analyze that further before running into the next incident and therefore decided to disable sandboxing on the top 5 subnets with a higher load. The corresponding patching is still ongoing.

This rollout was completed successfully [by updating the NNS subnet](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/43500). Some subnets remain without the sandboxing feature enabled until we have identified everything that we saw this week. 
[The next rollout](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/release-notes-for-new-replica-version-a094b/10696/2) has started and already addresses some findings.
