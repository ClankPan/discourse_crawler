**TL;DR**: DFINITY proposes to let neurons choose whether they are public or private. This would control which aspects of the neuron are visible to the rest of the world.

# Background

Earlier, a motion proposal was passed to create a neuron index in the NNS (basically, a list of all neuron IDs). This would add a great deal of transparency to the NNS.

# Motivation

On the other hand, for neurons that are more privacy sensitive, the additional transparency created by a neuron index might be unwelcome. Therefore, this proposal would let those neurons maintain their privacy if and when a neuron index feature is added to the NNS. Furthermore, in the meantime, they would be able to increase their privacy.

DFINITY proposes that neurons be able to decide whether they are public or private. Additional benefits of this proposal include the following:

* Neurons who want to keep their voting private would be able to make their ballots not visible to the rest of the world (even if their ID is or becomes known).
* On the other hand, those neurons that want to invite the world's scrutiny (such as those who advertise themselves for following) would gain the ability to expose a great deal of additional information about themselves.

In either case, the neuron would be in control of their own visibility; thus, addressing the competing concerns of both transparency vs. privacy.

# Overview

The choice of public or private would control which fields in a neuron would be visible to the rest of the world.

Neurons would be private by default. That is, if a neuron takes no action, it would be considered private.

Known neurons would always be public.

# Private Neurons

Currently, a subset of fields of all neurons are readable by the rest of the world (as long as the neuron's ID is or becomes known). Whereas, only the following fields of private neurons would be visible:

* id
* stake & voting power (not maturity, though staked maturity can be inferred)
* voting power bonus:
  * dissolve delay
  * age (also creation time)

This means that the following fields would not be visible for private neurons:

* ballots
* Neurons' Fund membership

# Public Neurons

For public neurons, with one exception, all information would be visible to all. The exception is ICP ledger account ID. The reason for this exception is that it seems particularly sensitive, since it can be used for in-depth ledger tracing. The remaining information, which would be visible, is as follows:

* id
* controller
* hot_keys
* kyc_verified
* not_for_profit
* known_neuron_data
* cached_neuron_stake_e8s
* neuron_fees_e8s
* maturity_e8s_equivalent
* staked_maturity_e8s_equivalent
* auto_stake_maturity
* when_dissolved_timestamp_seconds
* dissolve_delay_seconds
* aging_since_timestamp_seconds
* created_timestamp_aeconds
* followees
* recent_ballots
* joined_community_fund_timestamp_seconds
* transfer

# Next Steps

DFINITY is really excited to start working towards developing a neuron index for the NNS. Feedback on this proposal would be greatly appreciated. Once the community has reached consensus, DFINITY will begin implementation.

Sormarler | 2024-06-06 17:59:17 UTC | #2

Yes please make it happen. Whenever you can add options for users it should be the default choice.

-------------------------

Doudi | 2024-06-06 18:17:32 UTC | #3

No comment about that. 

But since you are about to make a proposal to implement it, could you also suggest to let neurons ( known or not ) the possibility to have and change their description over time ?

Something like a edit button and a markdown format would be nice. With max 2000 characters.

Would be beautiful to see a bit of customisation there.

Privacy is a huge plus, but this would break functionality in dapps like NNSCat ([https://iz6s6-kqaaa-aaaae-qaakq-cai.ic0.app/](https://iz6s6-kqaaa-aaaae-qaakq-cai.ic0.app/)) which lets you enter your neuron id and see whether you’ve voted on proposals, without having to keep logging in (or set hotkeys). It does this by checking the ballots for the neuron id you entered.

-------------------------

cryptodriver | 2024-06-07 03:01:01 UTC | #5

In many ways, ICP is doing more and more things that against blockchain.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-06-07 03:38:21 UTC | #6

I'd like to see the governance canisters have their own auditable, state-reproducing ICRC-3 log. I think it is important for the long-term trust and "blockchainyness" of the system.  We know we can ditch history because of the alien math, but no one else does and no one else trusts it. If ballots want to be secret, then we likely need to implement something like MACI. (https://clr.fund/#/about/maci)

-------------------------

MIGA | 2024-06-07 07:45:10 UTC | #7

This is a big step toward the right direction. Please make it happen. There is definitely a strong need to separate/distinguish public neurons from private neurons. 

Just to confirm, under this proposal, a public neuron will be able to see which other neurons are following it and how much voting power is pledged on it, correct? 

Say, my own public neuron has voting power of 10; 3 other neurons are following mine, with additional total voting power of 5. So I should be able to see: 

1. total number of my followers = 3; 
2. the neuron ID for each of these 3 followers; 
3. the voting power for each of these 3 followers; 
4. the total voting power that is associated with my neuron = 15. 

Is that the right understanding? Thanks!

cryptodriver | 2024-06-07 08:27:45 UTC | #8

Transparency, openness, and trustworthiness are essential elements of blockchain. ICP is going against the trend.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-06-08 00:35:48 UTC | #9

Are you for or against this?  I think giving users choices is the thing to do.

-------------------------

antinutrino | 2024-06-08 07:23:55 UTC | #10

I'm not sure I really understand why we would need public and private neurons. As previous comments have highlighted this appears to go against the fundamental concepts of transparency, openness and trust that are engrained within blockchain. I can't think of a good reason why we shouldn't be able to see which way a neuron has voted, it would seem to go against open governance.

I'd much rather see a proposal that allows for better control of staked neurons, such as moving from one II to another. That would be much more useful and not going against blockchain fundamentals.

-------------------------

Ajki | 2024-06-08 08:17:42 UTC | #11

I am against private neurons. The NNS governance should be fully transparent to ensure accountability and trust. 

On one hand, we are finally getting a neuron index to enhance transparency significantly. On the other hand, there are suggestions to reduce some of that transparency.

Can someone explain the benefits for governance if neurons could hide their votes?I can only think of it being used for nefarious purposes.

-------------------------

CLP | 2024-06-08 10:44:21 UTC | #12

I support it.
This is a good proposal: it supports multiple scenarios from a mechanism perspective, increases flexibility, and gives the choice to developers/users themselves.

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2024-06-08 12:30:24 UTC | #13

There's major downsides here for transparency and governance auditing. This change doesn't matter for the overwhelming majority of users, and the only real upsides I can think of are in a few edge cases. Maybe someone is being blackmailed to vote a certain way? But then the blackmailer would just demand proof of vote another way, or that you make your neuron non-private. Maybe you're a public figure with a known neuron ID and want to vote a certain way that is unpopular and don't want to risk reputational damage? Okay, but that would be a very rare situation and doesn't justify diminishing the entire network's ability to audit votes. For what other situations would this be of any real benefit?

-------------------------

cryptodriver | 2024-06-08 13:14:01 UTC | #14

I definitely totally against anything that against blockchain.

Trustworthiness is almost the only function of blockchain. 
However, ICP has been going against the trend and gradually reducing the trustworthiness that ICP lacks.

-------------------------

darien | 2024-06-08 13:30:23 UTC | #15

@cryptodriver I am not understanding.... how not knowing the way a Neruron, that is not a Known Neuron votes os so anti Blockchain.
Could you explain...

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-06-08 19:15:55 UTC | #16

There is no privacy on a blockchain. Transparency is paramount. Don't screw this up.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-06-08 22:30:07 UTC | #17

Zk provides plenty of privacy.

-------------------------

Mar | 2024-06-09 07:16:35 UTC | #18

I think I'm somewhat in favor; this could allow DFINITY employees to vote against the official DFINITY vote (increasing decentralisation). I don't think it matters much for the rest of us.

To be honest, I didn't think the original [proposal 48491](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491) made by @Kyle_Langham for neuron indexing was really about exposing information that is currently private.  I thought it was just about releasing all neuron IDs so they can all be accounted for using the existing public information about all neurons.  I think this is sufficient without having to consider the public/private option.

[quote="daniel-wong, post:1, topic:31597"]
DFINITY proposes that neurons be able to decide whether they are public or private.
[/quote]
If this change is implemented, will the neuron owner have the ability to make it reversible?  There are people who have been voting members for Synapse and CodeGov in the past who created new neurons and made their neuron IDs public (e.g. gave permission to publish their name and neuron ID on the [synapse.vote](https://www.synapse.vote/voting-members) or [codegov.org](https://www.codegov.org/neuron) websites).  They did this for the purpose of voting transparently on specific proposal topics while they were active as voting members (aka Followees) for these known neurons.  However, when they are no longer voting members, they no longer have a need or desire to stay in the public limelight.  It would be nice if they could toggle off the public configuration and not have to worry about whether people in the ecosystem are following them and don't have to see their voting history displayed on the dashbaord or IDGeek.

[quote="daniel-wong, post:1, topic:31597"]
In either case, the neuron would be in control of their own visibility; thus, addressing the competing concerns of both transparency vs. privacy.
[/quote]
Another use case for public / private configurations would be to enable known neurons to remove themselves from the known neuron registry.  I suspect there are many known neurons today that would select this option if it were available including The Fool's Court (@LightningLad91 may be able to confirm).

If you provide this optionality for the known neuron, then it would be good to indicate that the neuron ID is no longer public in the NNS dApp.  That is probably something that people would want to know if they are following a neuron that was once a public known neuron, but their status has changed.

[quote="daniel-wong, post:1, topic:31597"]
The remaining information, which would be visible, is as follows:
...
- hot_keys
...
- followees
...
[/quote]

I believe the public information proposed would be fine for both CodeGov and Synapse.  If fact, this would make it easier to expose our Followees than our current methodology, which is Neuron Management proposals and website updates.

It would also be nice if the public information about Followee configuration could be exposed for each topic individually.  That way it would be easy for people to see which known neurons claim to specialize in specific proposal topics instead of having them show up in the list for all proposal topics.  For example, most known neurons are only known to specialize in the Governance and the SNS&Neurons fund, but not any of the technical topics.  This leads to confusion about which known neurons are really suitable choices for individual topics.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2024-06-10 11:30:10 UTC | #20

Thanks for tagging me @wpb. I agree it would be nice to remove The Fools' Court from the known neuron listing.

@daniel-wong I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the public/private neuron concept. In general, it seems like we should want as much transparency as possible without hurting anyone. Given the lack of personal information tied to a neuron I don't see how public ballots hurt anyone.

I also found these two lines very interesting when considered together:

[quote="daniel-wong, post:1, topic:31597"]
Neurons would be private by default. That is, if a neuron takes no action, it would be considered private.
[/quote]

[quote="daniel-wong, post:1, topic:31597"]
Whereas, only the following fields of private neurons would be visible:

* stake & voting power (not maturity, though staked maturity can be inferred)
[/quote]

If this proposal was adopted and implemented would it mean we'd no longer be able to account for the unstaked maturity controlled by private neurons?

-------------------------

cryptodriver | 2024-06-10 12:42:24 UTC | #21

The fact is that whether you object or not, ICP will veto your objection through absolute voting rights. This is ironic. Without openness and trustworthiness, why do we need blockchain?

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:30890"]
In response to community feedback, the proposal to reduce neuron dissolve delays was modified to include an opt-in mechanism. If 25% of neurons opt in, the proposed changes would result in a modest 3.8% reduction in voting rewards. **Given the community’s concerns and the limited impact, it is recommended not to pursue this proposal further.**

The second proposal, concerning exchange maturity, has received relatively little attention and has been highlighted as complex by the community. **Considering these factors, it is advised to table this proposal for now.**
[/quote]

-------------------------

daniel-wong | 2024-06-11 12:38:09 UTC | #23

Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you for all the feedback. It really is appreciated.

I think the main concern is that neurons can choose for their votes to be hidden. Let me address that in this post. For specific individual questions, I'll reply in a separate post.

In regards to votes being private, the concern is very valid and understandable. Clearly, the more transparent the system is, the easier it is to trust it. On the other hand, I don't think implementing this proposal means that the system can't be trusted anymore.

Regarding transparency and trust, here are some important points that we hope people will consider:

* As the system stands now, not all votes are visible to the whole world. This proposal would not change that.
* The vote counting machine itself is completely transparent. By [reading the code] of the governance canister and the platform that it runs on, you can prove or refute *by yourself* that it does what it's supposed to (e.g. votes are counted correctly). There is no need to take someone else's word for it (e.g. DFINITY).
* Not everything in all blockchains is public. For example, you generally cannot connect an ID with a real life person.
* Trust is always our highest aim. Whereas, you can think of transparency as a *means* to achieve trust as an *end*.
* When applied in the wrong places, transparency *destroys* trust. For example, it is of the utmost importance that encryption keys ***not*** be transparent.

[reading the code]: https://github.com/dfinity/ic

I think the question should be, "Do I need to take someone else's word at face value? Or, can I prove or refute *by myself* that the system does what it's supposed to?". If you can prove or refute correctness by yourself, I would argue that the system is verifiable (and therefore, trustworthy).

Regarding privacy, here are some additional points:

* It is *also* a reasonable concern, and deserves our consideration. Examples abound, including in the realm of voting. Some have already been mentioned in earlier posts. Let me offer another one: when voting on whether to form a labor union, it is generally considered "good" that ballots be kept secret so that people can vote without fear of retaliation.
* Private voting is normal in the offline world. One reason is to prevent vote buying.
* It is possible to reconcile privacy with verifiability.

One way to achieve both privacy and verifiability is for the vote counting *process* to be transparent to everyone, not necessarily every individual ballot. This is just as true inside the blockchain world as it is outside. The way this is achieved in the ICP governance is to open source the vote counting machine. Everyone can (and should) inspect it.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-06-14 01:07:20 UTC | #24

100%. There are some crypto ethos we should adhere, especially transparency for transactions.

-------------------------

Ajki | 2024-06-16 13:15:33 UTC | #25

Please refrain from implementing any privacy options in governance matters, as everything should be completely transparent, including voting choices, stake, voting power, maturity, follow/followers, dissolved delay, age, etc.

**The NNS DAO will lose all credibility if participation details are hidden.** 
As ICP is still in its early days, we have been anticipating upgrades to enhance transparency. However, just as the Neuron index, which will significantly improve transparency, has passed, there is already talk of making details hidden.

I sincerely hope Dfinity drops the matter and announces it as they did with possible tokenomics changes. 

If more NO votes are needed on this topic, let us know so we can run a X campaign calling on the community to voice their opinions here. I don't think it's something positive that should be publicized on X, and Dfinity should also refrain from voting in case of a proposal.

Why would you make votes for this poll public?  :grinning:

I guess it's a convenient way to know who to attack if someone votes YES and you are in the anti-private neuron camp...

...AND vice versa of course.

It's quite ironic to use a public poll to assess the sentiment of who is in favor of private neurons.

BTW, I hope this doesn't come across in a negative way.  It was only meant to be funny.

[/quote]

To prove the point, otherwise, we may end up with the majority in the comments being against private neurons while the poll shows the opposite. That's what we risk happening with NNS DAO governance.

I strongly believe that if you vote, you should be prepared to explain the reason behind your choice if called upon. While private voting may have its place, I believe it does way more harm than good. We should strive for greater transparency, even if it complicates certain situations where private voting might be preferred.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-06-17 03:57:00 UTC | #31

Neurons currently have private information that I believe should remain private unless the neuron owner wants to make it public.  The original intent of the neuron index proposal was to make sure that all neurons in the NNS could be accounted for since some of them have hidden neuron IDs.  This is the only major problem that needs to be solved.  This doesn't mean they need to be any more public than every other neuron.  The only place that it makes sense to have the private / public neuron discussion that goes beyond the current public / private information that already exists for every neuron is in relation to registered known neurons.  It would be helpful to make Followee selection AND hotkey IDs for registered known neurons public information.  Their votes are already public and they are stored indefinitely on the dashboard.  Interestingly, the NNS does not keep an indefinite record of the vote history of registered known neurons, but I think it should.  Any neuron that is not a registered known neuron should have the right to choose if their vote history is public or private.  I see this in a similar way to real world elections.  You don't have the right to know your neighbors vote unless they tell you.  In fact, the privacy of voting is essential to real world elections in order to get a true independent, objective result.  Otherwise, special interest groups would put pressure on citizens all the time to vote a specific way.  The same goes for blockchain governance.  It's just a bad idea to force neuron owners to have a public vote history.  At least the privacy part today comes from the fact that the vote history is recorded by neuron ID instead of identity.

[/quote]

I'm not suggesting that every neuron needs to go through KYC and expose its data. Each neuron remains private since the identity behind it is unknown unless it is voluntarily disclosed.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but what advantage is there in concealing data from an already anonymous neurons?

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-06-17 16:06:16 UTC | #33

Two examples come to mind.

1. Synapse and CodeGov Followees create new neurons for the purpose of making their votes on specific topics transparent to the community.  While they are voting members, they are not promising anything except transparency on those specific topics.  It does not include all topics and it is only for the duration that they are voting members on those topics.  However, once they expose the neuron ID and link it to their identity, their vote continues to be shown on the dashboard and vpgeek on all topics including after they have stopped their service as a public voter.  This is unfair to them because it can be easily misinterpreted and misrepresented.  They should be able to turn off this public visibility if the apps do not do it for them.
2. Neurons have account IDs that can often be somewhat easy to link to the neuron IDs by simply correlating staked amounts, dissolve delay, and age with voting power (all public information for any neuron ID).  Genesis neuron accounts can also be identified because the very first transaction in their account is a mint that occurred at genesis.  There are people who are skilled at tracing transaction history and making connections between publicly revealed identities and neuron IDs even when the publicly revealed information was not intended to result in connection to their neuron ID.  These connections should not be made easy if the neuron owner doesn't want it to be public.

I'm looking at this from the perspective that private members of the community should be allowed to remain private so they can vote with their own convictions without having to be influenced by vocal people in the community who will try to use their influence to persuade their vote.  Everyone needs to have the freedom to vote independent of these influences.

Maybe it's just me, but I honestly don't see the issue with transparent voting, especially considering the current blockchain space where other chains with  on-chain voting that allows direct tracking of wallets. 

I hope other community members share their perspectives, and thank you for providing examples.

My Comments:


I think this is a useless proposal and a malicious one because it allows these "named" neurons and champions of "decentralization" to escape accountability and collusion than they already are capable of.


I never see DFINITY building tools to improve transparency regarding voting, smart contracts and tokenomics. What's up with that I wonder... Maybe just the priorities don't align with world computer vision as some of the stake holders are not capable of it so they end up creating barriers to those who are.

-------------------------

Ajki | 2024-06-18 12:15:04 UTC | #42

I firmly believe that DFINITY, Synapse, and CodeGov are committed to the best interests of the ICP. I want to avoid posts like the one above that spread conspiracy theories, which transparent voting would negate. 

I am not saying that there aren't certain use cases where private neurons would be beneficial, but at what cost?

As the Russian proverb says, "Trust, but verify."

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-18 19:12:54 UTC | #47

Thanks DFINITY for consulting the community, and providing context. It's unfortunate that it's being met with animosity.

While I think this idea provides something valuable for the minority who may value their voting privacy (for whatever reason :person_shrugging:) I wonder if it also takes something valuable away from the majority (I'm assuming most people aren't fussed about their voting history being public and are skeptical of the motivations of those who are).

Perhaps individuals who wish to *take* their voting transparency away from the community should receive smaller rewards (in effect, paying some amount for their priviledge). This would incentivise transparency, recognising the value it provides for others, but wouldn't mandate it. The exact differential could be decided on by the community. What do you think?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-28 13:17:22 UTC | #48

Hi all, 
let me first reiterate or clarify a few important points about the high-level design.

**In many ways this proposal would *increase* transparency.**

* The design makes additional information available about some neurons (public ones) and especially about *known neurons*. This enables users to base their decision on who they want to follow on more on-chain, and therefore verifiable, information. For example, as a follower I can learn whether a known neuron that I follow in turn follows others and if so who these other neurons are.
* Already now, users can de facto “hide” the information about their neuron by not revealing their neuron ID, *including their stake*. A neuron index would ensure that neurons cannot be “hidden” anymore. The index would *list all neurons* with some information about them, *including the neuron’s stake*. This would provide more transparency, for example how the voting power is distributed among unique principals. ****Correction edit: this should say "among unique neurons."*** * 
* Already now, users can de facto “hide” the information about their neuron by not revealing their neuron ID, *including their ballots*. As this is an “indirect way” rather than an explicit feature, not all users might be aware about this and some might be surprised what kind of information they reveal when searching for their neuron on a dashboard. Since users already have this choice, we think it is preferable to give users an explicit choice that is easy to understand.

**This proposal does not decrease verifiability.**

* We agree that transparency is important. Why is this the case? The main motivation for transparency is to achieve verifiability, fully following the blockchain and security principle of *“verify, don’t trust”.*
* In voting, verifiability is split into *individual verifiability* which ensures that each voter can verify that their ballot was submitted and *universal verifiability* which ensures that anyone can convince themselves that all submitted ballots were counted in the result. Both of these properties are given in NNS governance: every user can see that their ballot is included in governance and everyone can verify the governance code and convince themselves that all submitted votes are considered in the end-result.
* Compared to now, the new design might make some ballots become visible which are not visible now - for example neurons whose ID is not known now but that choose to be public in the new design. The converse is also possible: for neurons whose ID is known but that will choose to be private. In both cases some ballots are visible while others are not. More importantly, *in both cases individual and universal verifiability are given as argued above.*

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-20 09:12:11 UTC | #49

Hi @Doudi, this is a nice idea. We also discussed that it would be nice for public neurons, no matter if known or not, to get a name. As always there are some details that would have to be considered.
We propose to tackle and discuss this with the community as a separate feature, as we think they are sufficiently independent and the change proposed here already adds value.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-20 09:19:22 UTC | #50

You are right that this change would require such platforms to adopt. We could communicate the detailed new APIs early and discuss how we can make the required work as minimal as possible. 
We think the change is worth this investment for the above mentioned reasons, such as:
* Such platforms could now show additional information for many neurons
* It cannot happen that users accidentally reveal information about their neuron that they didn't intent simply because they entered their neuron ID.

Keeping a log of all actions is an interesting idea, but I think it could maybe be discussed as an independent feature as I think this could be done with the current or the new proposed design and with all state being public or some of it being private (e.g., a canister can keep a log that can only be read in certain ways or circumstances). 
Would you agree?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-20 09:35:10 UTC | #52

Thanks for the feedback and the question!
The part about the followers is not quite right:
A public neuron would allow you to see (almost) all the properties of *this* neuron. Each neuron has a field that specifies who this neuron follows on which topics. So the neuron includes the follow**ees** but not the follow**ers**.
To make an example, let's assume: 

* Bob's neuron follows Charlies's neuron
* Bob's neuron is public
* Alice's neuron follows Bob's neuron 

When **looking at Bob's public neuron, we can see that Bob follows Charlie's neuron**. This is because Bob's neuron has a field defining who Bob follows. This allows Bob to follow someone else if he wants. So this is a "property of Bob's neuron" (you can think "this is Bob's choice").
In contrast, everyone can follow Bob's neuron. For example, Bob can share his neuron ID on X and Alice could just have found it there and decided that she trusts Bob on certain decisions. This is not tracked in Bob's neuron and Bob might not know about this. Rather, this is stored in Alice's neuron. Therefore **if we look at Bob's neuron, we do not see that Alice (or anyone else) follows Bob.**
Does this help? Please let us know if you have additional questions!

Thanks for the detailed answer, let me try to answer some questions / remarks in it!

> I didn’t think the original [proposal 48491 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491) made by @Kyle_Langham for neuron indexing was really about exposing information that is currently private.

Yes I think we agree with this. But de facto a neuron can "hide" some information atm by making sure the neuron ID is not known. This would not be possible anymore after an index. Therefore one could say that the index would actually "break some privacy" that is there today and see the introduction of private neurons as a way to have the choice that neurons have today but in a more explicit way. 

>If this change is implemented, will the neuron owner have the ability to make it reversible?

Yes, this is the idea!

> It would also be nice if the public information about Followee configuration could be exposed for each topic individually.

IIRC the following is already a map of topic to followees. So I think it would indeed be possible for frontends / dashboard to parse this and display it nicely per topic.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-20 09:53:33 UTC | #54

Just want to clarify a few points here to avoid misunderstandings:

> it allows these “named” neurons and champions of “decentralization” to escape accountability

The named neurons (or "known neurons") would all be public. So more information about them would be known and thus I think they could be held accountable even more than today.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-20 10:03:26 UTC | #55

Thanks for this idea!
I personally prefer not adding different rewards for private neurons for the following reasons:
* There could be neurons that always wanted to remain private when they staked. They could now do so by keeping their neuron ID confidential. If we introduce a neuron index, they might want to become private. They would now get less rewards for a similar behavior than now and could **perceive this as unfair.**
* Making voting rewards dependent on one more factor comes with a cost. First, this makes the code that computes the voting rewards **more complex** (and complexity usually also comes with higher risks of bugs) and, more importantly, this makes it even **harder for new users to understand** the NNS and what rewards they can expect. This can be justified in some case, but in my opinion there are other cases where this is more justified (for example in the context of periodic confirmation and voting activity). 
* We could consider **other ways to incentivise neurons to be public**. For example, above someone mentioned that also neurons that are not "known neurons" could have a name or description. Such a feature could be introduced but for **public neurons only** - this would maybe motivate more users to move to public.

In many ways this proposal would *increase* transparency.
[/quote]

I would like to add that many of us were eagerly awaiting Dfinity to enhance transparency, as **the current system lacks it**. 

The Neuron Index would solve this issue. Personally, I always expected that it would eventually be added, understanding that there were more pressing priorities initially. Despite the potential minor use cases for private neurons, I believe the cost is too high to cater to a small minority, as it would compromise the expected transparency of the DAO.

No transparency or partial transparency is, in my opinion, the same; it's either no transparency or full transparency. When it comes to governance, we know what the majority expect, so I will definitely vote NO for such a proposal.

**Can we get a clear statement on whether Dfinity plans to vote on the proposal if it appears on the NNS?**

-------------------------

vavram | 2024-06-20 13:11:51 UTC | #57

Completely agreed, any obfuscation whether optional or not does nothing but undermine the core principles of blockchain like transparency and trustlessness. Can't say I'm surprised that DFINITY wants to implement another shady feature like this.

-------------------------

Txo | 2024-06-20 13:36:41 UTC | #58

While the proposal claims to increase transparency, introducing private neurons could create loopholes for hidden agendas and obscure governance activities, contradicting the primary goal of full transparency.

If you allow private neurons you undermine the integrity and trust in the NNS governance system.

Transparency first, trust follows

-------------------------

Vrive058 | 2024-06-20 13:42:41 UTC | #59

Transparency is a Big factor. On this early years of development.
Keeping it "open" creates Trust & accountability.
Being private at least right now, may lead to manipulation on voting.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-06-20 14:45:32 UTC | #60

I understand where DFINITY comes from on this topic and understand that there is an emergent property of how the IC runs that doesn't require complete history to be verifiable since genesis, but using it at this point creates confusion and misalignment with the general crypto-ecosystem in general.  People don't get it and they DON'T trust it. Never mind that they should or that they can verify the code....they want to see, touch, feel the log and verify there has been no funny business.

If a feature such as zkVotes and MACI have the property of hiding data, that is generally acceptable as long as the inputs that produce the validation are available.

Further, since nodes can/could keep track of incoming messages and signatures the 'secretness' is only as good as the nodes are honest.  Basically, as practice, if it could become public, just make it public.

I'm not against secret ballots as I think things like MACI attached to zkHumanity are just about the only hope for truly safe and well-formed coin voting...I just don't like to see 'sorta' secret ballots and I'm weary of having to try to re-explain that the IC doesn't need to record and archive this info on-chain because of alien math.  Just put the data on the chain and let the maxis figure out the emergent tech once bought in.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-21 08:16:29 UTC | #61

Thanks for taking the time to reply! 

To narrow it down, I think we agree that transparency is important but we probably disagree on the statement
> it’s either no transparency or full transparency

In my view it should be *enough transparency* to make the system fully verifiable - which does not necessarily mean that *everything* is open. 

Indeed, I think there are just different opinions on this part and it is probably most constructive to bring this to a motion proposal. 
I therefore plan to draft a motion proposal next week. With it, I can also try to get a better understanding of how DFINITY plans to vote.

I hope this makes sense and I wish you soon a nice weekend!

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-21 08:27:08 UTC | #62

Thanks for the reply.

Can you elaborate why you think something like MACI is better?
Do I understand correctly that you think it is more acceptable because it is more what people are used to and because it provides stronger privacy?

> I just don’t like to see ‘sorta’ secret ballots

I think this could be strengthened in the future and already distinguishing private and public neurons would also help as a step if we ever want to go there (probably even if we add more elaborate encryption schemes or so, we always want to be ballots of e.g, the know neurons to be open)

-------------------------

[/quote]

What does "enough transparency" actually mean? 
Basically, we are setting up the system to obfuscate transparency and calling it "transparent enough." As I said, there is no middle ground here.

The sad thing is that, based on this topic, the minority pointed out case where they could see it as useful, while the majority is against it.

I also believe it's premature to make a formal proposal before gathering more feedback. The official Dfinity account on X should post about it, similar to how it handled the tokenomics change. Governance is one of the most crucial aspects for ICP, and it's too important an issue to rush, especially during the summer when many people are on vacation and not actively participating.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-06-21 12:10:47 UTC | #64

MACI becomes a better solution when things like coercion and bribery enter into the coin-voting realm.  It allows you to submit many votes but only one of them is a real vote and there is no way for a briber or coercive individual to figure out which is which...even the user can't be coerced into showing which vote is real.

Initial ideation: 

https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413
https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html

State of the Art: 

https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci?files=1

These things are likely not that important *until they are.*. And until we get decentralized away from DFINITY having a majority of liquid staking VP is likely the first hurdle to getting to a point where that could happen.  So it may not be a major concern, but I think it is worth making sure that the tech isn't moving away from a position where it could be useful.

-------------------------

Txo | 2024-06-21 14:36:47 UTC | #65

How do you address concerns about accountability if neuron holders voting decisions are entirely private?

What specific instances of pressure or manipulation have been reported that necessitate this change, and how will privacy directly mitigate these issues?

Can you provide concrete evidence or data showing that privacy will lead to more genuine participation and reduced coercion?

What are the specific technical and logistical challenges anticipated in implementing zkVotes and MACI, and how will they be addressed?

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-06-22 00:44:38 UTC | #66

I fully disagree with that. I believe ICP governance and anything related to transactions should be fully transparent and public like every other blockchain. The only exception to keeping things private are data inside applications like social media and other types of applications. But governance should be fully transparent and adhere to the crypto ethos.

[/quote]

Thanks for your response @lara. Could you clarify what you mean by 'remain private'. My understanding is that right now I could use the dashboard (or the API that feeds it) to enumerate all neurons in existence, and track their stake and voting history. Is this not correct? Couldn't I currently build my own neuron index if I wanted, by pulling details from the API?

I get the impression that different aspects of 'privacy' are being conflated in this thread. *One aspect is*:
- Visibility or inferability of the **ownership** of neurons. *an entirely separate aspect is*
- Visibility of what each neuron is doing

My understanding is that you're proposing allowing individuals to *take* visibility of what their neurons are **doing** away from the community. Is that not correct?

I don't see how visibility of ownership really comes into this. For example, you can create separate internet identities if desired, to conceal your own identity and/or separate certain activities from another II that you use.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-24 11:42:50 UTC | #68

Thanks for the questions, here some initial answer from me: 

> How do you address concerns about accountability if neuron holders voting decisions are entirely private?

Here I think we have to define what we mean by accountability. Since it is not clear which person is behind a neuron, I guess one can argue that full accountability according to some definitions would be hard in any case.

> What specific instances of pressure or manipulation have been reported that necessitate this change, and how will privacy directly mitigate these issues?

I am personally not aware that concrete cases have been reported, but I know that different users expressed the wish to not reveal their ballots. 
IMH one main motivation for this in any democracy is that small players can express their opinion even though they might be worried to contradict the "bigger players" or more influential community members.
Personally, in the NNS but also in real world voting, even though I haven't felt any pressure from anywhere, I prefer that I can take decision freely without even having to think about how my vote could be perceived by others and what consequences that might have for my reputation etc.

>Can you provide concrete evidence or data showing that privacy will lead to more genuine participation and reduced coercion?

I think no one can do this for the concrete case of the NNS, because to so we first would need to measure these things (which might not be very easy) and then also try out the both options to compare them.

>What are the specific technical and logistical challenges anticipated in implementing zkVotes and MACI, and how will they be addressed?

I am not sure if you have something concrete in mind with "logistical" challenge? But generally, I don't think we have fully researched these options. If we decide to explore more cryptographic voting protocols, there are also plenty of other options out there. So if we go this way, I think we should first compare the protocols that have already been mentioned here with other options.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-24 11:55:42 UTC | #69

Thanks for the clarifying question! 

> My understanding is that right now I could use the dashboard (or the API that feeds it) to enumerate all neurons in existence, and track their stake and voting history. Is this not correct? 

This is not correct. Whenever a new neuron is created, it gets a new random neuron ID. This is not known to anyone except for the user that created the neuron.
This is also the reason **why no one, including the dashboard, can currently build a neuron index**: we don't know all the neuron IDs that exist - only NNS governance does.

The dashboard only includes the neurons whose IDs became public in one or the other way. For example, if a user enters their neuron ID on the dashboard to look at it, the dashboard will afterward remember the ID and this neuron can later be found by other, too. 
So if you would like to keep your ballots, or any other aspects, of your neuron private, you could be very careful to never share your neuron ID.  As mentioned above, I think this is not ideal as this might not be known by everyone and can indeed be very confusing (both for those who would like to have this option but are not aware that they can do this but also for those who accidentally enter their neuron ID on the dashboard or elsewhere and are not aware of the consequences). 

This is also why the neuron index would be a big win for transparency: it would introduce an index on the governance that explicitly lists all neuron IDs - also allowing the dashboard and other integrations to know all neurons IDs.

> I get the impression that different aspects of ‘privacy’ are being conflated in this thread. My understanding is that you’re proposing allowing individuals to *take* visibility of what their neurons are **doing** away from the community. Is that not correct?

Right, this is not about the ownership in the sense of which real-life person owns a neuron but rather about what a neuron is doing - for which neuron it might be known that it belongs to a certain user on the forum / X / real life person or it might not be known.
As argued above, this would also add visibility - for example revealing all the neurons and their stake, which is not the case now. 
I hope the first part of may question clarifies to what extent it actually makes more information accessible?

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-06-24 20:06:07 UTC | #70

Thanks @lara, this information is very helpful. I wasn't aware of this. I'll run some experiments to see if I can witness this behaviour in action :slight_smile:  (I'll also plan to check the code at some point)

I'm still of the opinion that it would be good to incentivise users to make their ballots public, but I'm not strongly opinionated about it.

Just for arguments sake, lets say all but a few neurons end up making their ballots private after this change is made. Would DFINITY consider this to be a fine outcome?

-------------------------

> ****Correction edit: this should say “among unique neurons.”*** *

For full transparency and to avoid misunderstandings I wanted to point out that I fixed this typo in my previous message. The rest of the message is still unchanged.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-06-28 13:54:28 UTC | #72

Hi all, 
thanks again for all the feedback and questions above! Since this discussion has been open for three weeks now, we think a good next steps is to submit a motion proposal to better understand what the full NNS community thinks about the idea. 

We plan to submit the motion proposal next week on Monday (July 1st). 
Let me already share the motion proposal draft with you here:

# Proposal Title:

Public and private neurons & neuron index

# Proposal Summary:

## TL;DR

Introduce public and private neurons and a neuron index

* Public neurons provide more transparency to followers
* Private neurons keep ballots confidential
* More transparency by revealing all neurons’ IDs and their stake

## Current situation

**For a neuron whose neuron ID is known, there is some information that everyone can get about the neuron, including:**

* The neuron’s stake and voting power
* The neuron’s voting power bonus in the form of the dissolve delay and age (and the neuron’s creation time)
* The neuron’s ballots

* Whether the neuron is a member of the Neurons’ Fund

**Not all neuron IDs of neurons in the NNS governance are known today.**

The reason for this is that whenever a new neuron is created, it gets a new random neuron ID. This neuron ID is only known to the user that created the neuron and to the NNS.

**This has the following consequences.**

1. If a **user would like to hide information about their neuron, they can keep their neuron ID secret.** This is an important feature to some users who would like to keep their ballots private, in order to vote freely and not fear consequences. For these neurons whose IDs are kept secret, no information is publicly known.
2. It is **not possible today to build an index of all neurons**. The community has adopted a proposal to build a neuron index in NNS governance (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491). Once implemented, this allows users to get a comprehensive overview of how much each neuron stakes, allowing for example to get more insights with respect to how much stake is locked for how long.
3. If a user **would like to show details about their neuron to the public, there is no easy way to do so**. This means for example, that followers of a known neuron cannot easily query the NNS to learn settings of the known neuron, such as who the known neuron follows on different topics.

## Proposed new design

This proposal suggests a new design that addresses all needs above. For all neurons, it provides more transparency with respect to the stake. At the same time it maintains the users’ choice how much they would like to reveal with respect to their ballots where this is requested. Finally, for users who would like to reveal more information about their neuron, the new design provides an easy way to do so.

### Details of the new design

* For public neurons, everyone can read all fields of the neuron, except for the ICP ledger account ID. The reason for this exception is that this is particularly sensitive and can be used for in-depth ledger tracing.
* For private neurons, everyone can read the following fields
  * Neuron ID
  * The neuron’s stake and voting power
  * The neuron’s voting power bonus in the form of the dissolve delay and age (and the neuron’s creation time)
  * The neuron’s type indicating that the neuron is a seed or ECT neuron
* A neuron index in NNS governance lists all private and public neurons.
* Neuron can choose to be private or public and change this at any point in time. The known neurons are public while all other neurons are set to private by default.

This design has the following consequences regarding the above mentioned user needs.

1. If a user would like to keep their voting behavior confidential, they can set their neuron to be private.
2. The neuron index provides more transparency by listing all neurons and important information about them, such as how much they stake.
3. If a user would like to show details about their neurons to the public, they can set their neuron to be public. This allows any neuron, but especially known neurons, to provide additional transparency about their behavior to their followers.

### Resulting properties

* This design increases the transparency with respect to the neurons’ stake and voting power.
* This design maintains the main verifiability properties of the voting process.
  * As is the case now, each user can verify that their vote was submitted (individual verifiability) and all users and outsiders can verify that the tallying process is correct by verifying the code (universal verifiability).
  * With respect to ballot visibility, the new design can make some ballots visible which are not visible now (unknown neuron IDs that chose to be public) and vice versa (neurons who choose to be private).

[/quote]

So why do we need private neurons? As you said, it's not clear who the user behind it is. Why can't the system be fully transparent, and why is there a need to hide how neurons voted?

Don’t be a known neuron and don’t expose your Neuron ID – problem solved. I seriously think this is one of the biggest mistakes since **the majority of the community, as seen in this topic, is against it.** **If, before making an official proposal, DFINITY wants to get general feedback first, why is it completely ignored in this case?**

As an analogy with real-world voting, we have anonymous ballots, but now we are basically allowing those anonymous ballots to hide information how they voted and how much voting power they have.This clearly does not make any sense. 


If already exposed neurons don't want everyone to see how they vote, then make a proposal so that, one time, the same Internet Identity can generate a new Neuron ID and remove the feature after a month.

[quote="lara, post:68, topic:31597"]

Who are these different users, and where is the support for this proposal? 

Besides DFINITY, only three more people support it. After three weeks, it is clear that the vast majority on this topic is against it. 

Why push a proposal with so little support? This situation seems like insider manipulation that will cause more harm than good. What exactly needs to be hidden? There are other solutions available. Either garner more support or delay the proposal.

**I am asking again: Will DFINITY vote on this proposal?** or this is also something that need to be hidden ???

Could we get @dominicwilliams stance on it?

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-06-28 21:11:44 UTC | #75

I will certainly vote against this proposal. I remain entirely unconvinced that partial transparency has any place in blockchain governance. I have not read a single strong argument for why this is a good idea, while the evidence suggests that everyone in the community wants full transparency. Whom are we trying to protect? There are places for secrecy, but governance is not one of them.

-------------------------

Ori | 2024-06-29 11:41:24 UTC | #76

Thanks Lara. A more granular permission would be needed, apps that simply want to let you keep track of which proposals you’ve voted on do not need or want full hotkey levels of trust. 
Giving users the choice to set a permission that allows them to just view their ballots in an app would be ideal.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-01 11:48:50 UTC | #77

>So why do we need private neurons? As you said, it’s not clear who the user behind it is. 

One example that was pointed out by others in this thread is that it could be useful for a user who is contributing to a known neuron at some point (in which case the information should be public), but later they prefer to keep the information private as they are not contributing anymore to a known neuron. 

> If, before making an official proposal, DFINITY wants to get general feedback first, why is it completely ignored in this case?

To me, this forum conversation demonstrates that we are not ignoring the feedback. We listen to the counter-points and take the time to understand it and to engage in a discussion. This time, it was just the case that in the end there are different preferences with respect to which properties are more important. We have taken into account the feedback but haven't changed our view. 

>After three weeks, it is clear that the vast majority on this topic is against it. 
Why push a proposal with so little support? 

As much as we understand that not everyone agrees, we believe this feature brings value to many NNS DAO participants that are not necessarily active on the forum. Therefore, we propose to follow with a motion proposal to be able to take into account not only the voice on the forum but from the full NNS DAO. 

With respect to DFINITY's preferences: I shared the above view and motion proposal as the view of DFINITY and not just my personal view. So DFINITY likes the proposal.

-------------------------

Do I understand correctly that you can only follow public neurons? I think this is a big consequence that may not be sufficiently clear to everybody. 

What happens when I follow a public neuron that then chooses to become private? Would I not follow anymore? 

If we make all non-known-neurons private, does that mean all following for neurons that are not registered as known neurons is reset?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-07-02 08:46:24 UTC | #84

> Do I understand correctly that you can only follow public neurons? I think this is a big consequence that may not be sufficiently clear to everybody.

This is not included in the feature we are discussing in this motion proposal. It is something that we were brainstorming about as a future step, but then we would of course present a more detailed design and discuss this feature again with the community. 

Independently from this features, it is suggested to work on periodic confirmation of following (see the current idea [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increasing-decentralization-reducing-icp-inflation-with-a-single-proposal/30953/92)). I think a better moment to discuss whether following should be limited to public neurons is after we have periodic confirmation and learned how this would work (which will already reset some following).

> What happens when I follow a public neuron that then chooses to become private? Would I not follow anymore?
If we make all non-known-neurons private, does that mean all following for neurons that are not registered as known neurons is reset?

To avoid misunderstandings, let me repeat that **the current feature would not influence following at all and nothing would be reset**.

[quote="lara, post:48, topic:31597"]
Already now, users can de facto “hide” the information about their neuron by not revealing their neuron ID, *including their stake*. A neuron index would ensure that neurons cannot be “hidden” anymore. The index would *list all neurons* with some information about them, *including the neuron’s stake*. This would provide more transparency, for example how the voting power is distributed among unique neurons.
[/quote]
This might be a late question to ask, but I'm curious about the answer if there is one. In the quote above, to achieve transparency, it is necessary to unhide all neuron IDs with neuron index. 

My question here, is the goal of this transparency for accountability? If the goal is for accountability, can this be achieved using some kind of cryptographic technique (perhaps something similar like zero knowledge) to verify the validity of the data and show them as aggregate/summary, and not necessary to expose all neuron IDs? The goal is to achieved the objective without tinkering with the privacy that is currently in place in the system.

Throwing in my summarized thoughts:
* Decentralized networks must primarily focus on earning trust
* Trust is earned by being public, not private
* Therefore I join @Ajki, @Sormarler, and others that governance should be public
* Verifiable privacy is a difficult, long-term endeavor to work towards once trust is earned

I expect that DFINITY will vote.

Thanks for the question. 
You mean whether it would be possible to show the same information but without the neuron IDs in a trustworthy way?

The governance canister already has aggregated data, e.g., how much stake is in neurons that are locked 0-6 months, 6-12 months etc. 
One could imaging doing the same in a more fine-grained way, up to the neuron-level.
Because the governance canister can be verified, this information would be trustworthy. 

I think there was just a decision to be made what info is and isn't included to achieve a balance of the requirements: As there were no voices raised wrt keeping the neuron IDs private (only the ballots), but some that would like to have as much as possible public, this is just the tradeoff that was proposed.

In my understanding (CMIIW),  the main goal of "neuron index would ensure that neurons cannot be 'hidden' anymore" is to build trust using traditional methods, allowing people to reproduce the number in a granular way to verify the 'correctness' of the information displayed by the governance canister.

Although, as you mentioned, "because the governance canister can be verified, this information would be trustworthy," but the neuron index is still requested, this suggests there is still some level of distrust. 

If this level of distrust is what is being addressed, could the objective be achieved with some form of cryptographic verification / Zk proving without the need to create a neuron index ?

However, if the purpose of the neuron index is indeed to enable data intelligence practices to track down the owners of specific neurons, then this is a different matter.

In my opinion, hiding the neuron ID in the neuron index alone is not enough, because the unique figures of staking amount, maturity, and voting power of each individual neuron could already provide enough information to track down the owner or behaviour of the neuron.

The main difference that I see between public and private neurons is the ability to keep your vote confidential or not. Everything else is transparent and it seems like the indexer will be able to reveal ALL neurons with even more details. I’m on board with this, I don’t see any wrong unless I’m missing something.

I am asking again: Will DFINITY vote on this proposal?

So much for Dfinity not voting on governance proposals.

I must say, it's truly disappointing how this proposal was rushed.Requests for comments were basically ignored since the majority was highly against private neurons.

To be fair, DFINITY votes on the vast majority of Governance proposals.  It's not very often that they abstain.  Even if they didn't vote, the result is still very lopsided in favor of this proposal.  It seems to me that the vocal opposition that commented in this thread were actually the minority opinion.  This is why it is typically a good idea to take a proposal to the NNS instead of leaving it to be decided by forum discussions.  You don't really know who is in the majority until the NNS votes are cast.

It could be that this is possible, depending on the information reviewers are interested in. 
One advantage of including the neurons' data that doesn't need to be private in plaintext format (not in some ZK proof) is that this is probably the easiest way for users to understand. Understanding ZK proofs requires substantial more knowledge to fully understand.

I don't think this is the goal.

For developers, I have started a [new thread regarding API changes and migration strategy](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-comments-api-changes-for-public-private-neurons/33360) for this feature.
