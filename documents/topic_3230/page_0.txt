Hi , I’m trying to connect to the ledger and get the account identifier . 
I have generated the Principal Identifier . 
I’m following all the steps , when I get to step 5 which 
dfx ledger account-id 
It says command not found and I can’t proceed . 
I also tried step 6 same thing . 
If someone can help please . I’m not a developer and I feel it’s hard to connect so I can send, recieve ICP and stake. 
Your help is really appreciated

    DFX_VERSION=0.7.0-beta.7 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

Download the above version of dfx to use the ledger commands.

To get your balance on the IC you can do:
`dfx ledger --network ic balance` (this gives the balance for the account-id associated with your current dfx identity) or `dfx ledger --network ic <ledger account-id>` (this gives the balance of a specific account)

Thank you Prithvi, It did actually work, Thank you so much. I am just waiting to receive the ICP for now so I can continue with the rest of the commands and hopefully they work smoothly. Thanks again
