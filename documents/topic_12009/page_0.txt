Hi everyone,

With my team we are really motivated to gather the Paris community  and organize some events where builders can share their experiences building on the Internet Computer.
If you are interested, please leave a comment.
We are still brainstorming around the scope and the format of the events. Feel free to give us your insights around this.
The name of the group is not the definitive, we can still discuss this too. 

Our objective is to schedule a event in person in Paris (we can host the event at our office). 

See you soon !
