Hi, I would like to gather info from my canisters using the Rust agent by calling [canister_status](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#ic-canister_status) using the management canister but here is what I get as a response :

`The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content:
<html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.21.3</center>
</body>
</html>`


Using the interface spec [from here](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#ic-candid) : 
> canister_status : (record {canister_id : principal}) -> (record {
      status : variant { running; stopping; stopped };
      settings: definite_canister_settings;
      module_hash: opt blob;
      memory_size: nat;
      cycles: nat;
  });

```Rust
let management_canister_id = Principal::from_text("aaaaa-aa")?;
// Address is actually a different valid one on the ic.
let arg = Encode!( &Canister { canister_id: Principal::from_text("rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai") } )?;

agent
    .update(&management_canister_id, "canister_status")
     .with_arg(&arg)
     .call_and_wait(self.waiter.clone())
     .await?;
```

I've seen an example using JS, but does anyone managed to make it work with the Rust agent ?

(Sorry for the formatting, I have no idea to make it pretty looking for code snippet)

OK, I managed to get one step further by using the method [with_effective_canister_id](https://agent-rust.netlify.app/ic_agent/agent/struct.updatebuilder#method.with_effective_canister_id) while building my update call using the agent and now I get this in return :

> The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 403 Forbidden, content type "application/cbor", content: Only controllers of canister *****-taaaa-aaaae-aag7a-cai can call ic00 method canister_status

I am the controller of this one. I wonder what I'm missing here :thinking:

hummm I've tried with [canister_status from ic_utils](https://docs.rs/ic-utils/latest/ic_utils/canister/struct.Canister.html#method.canister_status) but I get the same error message about not being a controller.

So, I got it working !!

In order to work, the canister needs to have the principal-id as a controller and not only the wallet-id as needed with dfx 0.8.4.

I hope it will help someone else :sweat_smile:
