I have deployed an application on the IC. Now I am testing to upgrade the canister in the project. 
I am following [this article](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/project-setup/manage-canisters#upgrade-a-canister) to do so.

When I execute the command 
```
dfx canister --network ic install --all --mode upgrade
```
it runs successfully and shows me something like this,
```

But nothing get upgrade :no_mouth: 

Is the command not workable? 
**also tried to use "deploy" command which works though. But my concern is why it is not upgrading.

That because there's no changes in the project and DFX doesn't find any new assets to upload

-------------------------

Persu | 2022-09-23 07:35:54 UTC | #3

But I made a changes in the frontend file (index.html), mainly for testing only..

-------------------------

Maybe you forgot to save.

If you see these lines in the log you posted,

```
/index.html (2750 bytes) sha a66b84a50397e4000ebca538f8327a5dea61e6d4474e10b2c9cad360a09f29eb is already installed

```

DFX calculated the hash for your index.html file and found no changes to the already present file, hence did not upload it again.

-------------------------

Also in your `dfx.json` file that lists all your canisters, the asset canister listed has a `source` entry.

Ensure that the changes you made are included there or compiles to an output that is included there

-------------------------

That is what my concern is, I am changing the content of the file and trying to upgrade it. But why does it responding to that?

**I have saved the file.

-------------------------

Persu | 2022-09-23 09:56:50 UTC | #7

Does it work for you? I have delete everything from my index.html file and try to update it. It shows me the same msg and interestingly the frontend doesn't change anything! 

Do we need to run any other command after that?

Note: The dfx deploy works fine though. It change the required changes.

-------------------------

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/dfx-deploy

`dfx deploy` runs these 3 commands. You can run them yourself:

```
dfx canister create --all
dfx build
dfx canister install --all
```

Looks like you are only running install. If you don't run `dfx build` before it, it will not recompile your frontend into a new wasm that contains the changed code. That is what you're probably running into

-------------------------

Bravo!! It works!
The command goes like this,
```
dfx canister --network ic create --all
dfx build
dfx canister --network ic install --all --mode upgrade
```

Thank you!! :innocent:

I actually believe the asset canister Wasm doesn't change when you change the assets to upload to it. The assets aren't baked into the Wasm during build, rather `dfx` runs `icx-asset` to check if any assets changed and have to be uploaded/removed.
