Hi everyone,

If a DID is issued to a legal entity and that entity uses it to sign, do we need to implement the DID and its signature separately from Internet Identity? Is Internet Identity basically an authentication for each individual and cannot it be used as a corporate signature in the context of DID?

Could you please explain how you are issuing DIDs? Is it a legal entity DID?
