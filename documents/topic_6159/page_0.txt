I know there are discussions at Dfinity for things like automatic compounding for neuron voting rewards as well as combining and splitting neurons.  Is that something we need to discuss here is is that just a go-do for Dfinity?  If that is a discussion, I would like to say I am in full support and would like to see that happen ASAP.

Given the intentional long term investing tokenomics design, I would like to see better solutions for how neurons can be transferred to beneficiaries of an estate.  I want to remain invested for life, but the solutions to this problem that seem to be available today are quite unsatisfying.  I think there must be better ways to transfer neuron ownership to beneficiaries than fully dissolving an 8 year neuron or enabling a single beneficiary to take control of the principle ID.  I think a better solution needs to come from Dfinity instead of 3rd party products.  I agree with the reasoning why neuron ownership transfer is not allowed, but this is the one exception that I think makes sense.  I'm not at all trying to open the flood gates for other reasons for transferring neuron ownership and I understand this is a risk, but I'm just hoping someone at Dfinity can come up with a clever way to make this happen.

A way to beat/match the Eth burning strategy should be explored if possible. [Eth burn 120million Eth coins at peak.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0)

Alixthe | 2021-08-18 10:52:29 UTC | #5

Good point. How about a Master II (refer my post [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/expanded-internet-identity-support/6149/3?u=alixthe)) which can manage multiple IIs.  Also, perhaps the Master II could be pre-configured for certain eventualities for example in the event of a death (which needs to be verified by say the beneficiary), NNS will automatically spawn and pay ICP rewards to beneficiaries (assuming this is the intention for beneficiaries to have a continuous source of income from ICP staked) in the proportion set by the holder of the Master II.

-------------------------

Alixthe | 2021-08-18 11:07:09 UTC | #6

Firstly, thanks for opening up these proposals for community consideration - much appreciated!

At the moment, we can increase dissolve delay but cannot decrease. Is Dfinity planning to allow this to occur, in the event for example (referencing wpb) a death occurs and beneficiaries need immediate access to the funds locked-up (or perhaps if an unforeseen event occurs and the ICP holder needs urgent access to funds).  Perhaps there should be some discussion around this and what type of penalties need to be applied if a staked account is unlocked and disbursed.

In the alternative, perhaps some smart developer may already be developing a defi product that can borrow against the staked ICP in return for another token (say a stable coin or an ICP-derivative) which can be repaid from funds (and rewards) staked on the NNS.

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-08-18 12:50:45 UTC | #7

I like the idea of letting people unstake with a *severe* penalty. That penalty could then be distributed to other stakers.

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-08-18 20:30:40 UTC | #8

According to Coinmarketcap (https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043396252-Supply-Circulating-Total-Max-),

"Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of assets that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands. We have found that Circulating Supply is a much better metric than Total Supply for determining the market capitalization.

Assets that are locked (via smart contracts or legal contracts), allocated to the team or private investors, or not able to be sold on the public market, cannot affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following..."

Does the listed circulating supply of ICP take into consideration the tokens locked into neurons at any given point in time?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2021-08-19 13:04:49 UTC | #9

I prefer dfinity open up ownership transfer of a neuron (without restrictions) and then letting the market build the 3rd party marketplaces that allow someone to liquidate their neuron (by selling to another person), borrow against it, etc.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2021-08-19 13:09:49 UTC | #10

I think (but am not totally sure) that circulating supply is total ICP minted minus all ICP not on an exchange.  Most of the ICP not on exchanges is on the NNS.

The definition you provide basically states that locked coins are illiquid, which is only somewhat true in the case of ICP.  On the NNS there are millions of coins that are unlocked (or unlocking soon) and could be moved to an exchange in theory.  These coins are practically liquid.  However, there are many millions (100M+) that are locked for many years.  These coins are completely illiquid and couldn't affect price for many years.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2021-08-19 13:17:37 UTC | #11

I imagine one reason for this thread is because of the discussion of a change in tokenomics spawned by Domicic (...h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai.raw.ic0.app/post/88087/tokenomics-proposal-for-nns).

My personal opinion is that no sweeping change to the tokenomics model is needed at this time.  While there is still a lot of ICP in fully dissolved neurons, and if these tokens were to be sold it would probably negatively impact the price in the short or medium term, I think the overall design is working as it should (moving tokens from short term traders to long term stakers).  Over time this dynamic should work itself out.

However, I do think managing the number of new nodes, the inflation rate and the cycle burning rate should be closely monitored by anyone who has staked (and adjusted accordingly) to ensure, in order, : (1) rapid adoption by developers, (2) flexibility in network to support growth and (3) the proper balancing between minting new ICP tokens and the current burn rate.

-------------------------

MichaelAnnh | 2021-08-19 14:45:30 UTC | #12

I've given [input](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/staking-imbalance-via-1icp-treshold/6375?u=michaelannh) regarding the Tokenomics and the 1ICP treshold for spawning a neuron.

That's one important thing which came to my mind.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-08-19 14:46:00 UTC | #13

I like everything you said except for the 'without restrictions' part.

There are valid security concerns with letting someone just transfer their neuron at will. One of the abuse cases described by Dfinity was a scenario where someone capable of acquiring a large amount of ICP staked it for 8 years, voted in favor of a proposal or series of proposals that would harm the network, and then immediately sold it to avoid any financial loss.

I think there should be some sort of delay or waiting period (no voting capability) before a transfer can be completed.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-08-19 14:49:15 UTC | #14

I fully agree with this. I think the tokenomics model is working just fine. This will take time and I'd prefer ICP to slowly transfer into the hands of long-term stakeholders instead of day traders.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-08-24 00:22:18 UTC | #15

Hello all, just wanted to introduce myself. My name is John Wiegley and I'm a Principal Engineer at DFINITY, since three years ago. I've working with @johan on ideas related to future Tokenomics proposals, and have read all of ideas above with great interest. Please keep the flow of ideas coming, and let me know what you find confusing or worrisome, or what works great for you, in the current model.

Transfer of neurons is a hot issue that gets asked about in many places. There are definitely security issues, as mentioned above, where transferability could detach stakeholders from consequences, leading to negative voting scenarios. However, allowing early exit at penalty is definitely worth thinking about more. It's something Johan and I have discussed in the past, and even written some proposals to address, and we are still chewing on the idea. How would you imagine something like this working, that does not take away accountability from our current voting system?

John

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-08-25 16:38:14 UTC | #16

Nice to meet you John. I understand that there are security issues with an "early exit," but  I think those issues can largely be mitigated if you impose a *severe* penalty on those who do exit early. The way I envision this working is imposing some threshold amount for exiting a neuron early (say, 10%), and then increasing the penalty based on how much time is left on the neuron (up to, say, 40%). 

I cannot stress enough how important it is to make the penalty severe. As of my writing this, an 8-year neuron makes a return of nearly 30% in a year. If the penalty is not severe (e.g., if it is only 5%), an investor who wants to lock up their tokens for a short time (e.g., 6 months) could lock up their ICP in an 8-year neuron, and exit early for a massive profit. Indeed, if the exit penalty is low enough, no rational investor would lock their tokens in anything but an 8-year neuron. 

Separately, the penalty acts as a "tax" for any bad actor who wants to harm the system by (1) buying ICP, (2) voting with the ICP, and (3) selling the ICP immediately after voting. That tax must be severe to deter bad actors.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-08-26 20:36:09 UTC | #17

I'm curious what the initial reason for opening this thread was? Are there any problems with the tokenomics that the Foundation finds grave?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-08-26 20:41:27 UTC | #18

One of my biggest concerns is the gravity of the all-or-nothing lockup. I'm curious to know how this system was designed, as in was any empirical evidence used to test human psychology at a 4 year lockup versus an 8 year lockup?

I really wonder if there are differences in human behavior (we want people to choose to maximize the value of ICP and thus the Internet Computer, or vice versa) between 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 years given it's an all-or-nothing lockup and that number of years is just so incredibly long on the curve of innovation.

So, one proposal I have is getting rid of the all-or-nothing lockup by unlocking ICP in proportion to the current dissolve delay.

Right now, the dissolve delay mainly affects rate of return (in the maturity calculation) AFAIU, unless the dissolve delay is 0, and then the ICP can be unlocked. What if a portion of the ICP were unlocked as the dissolve delay decreased? So if you hit dissolve on a neuron with an 8 year delay, 1 year in to the dissolving you could unlock 7/8 of the ICP, and this would of course by calculated each day or whatever, similar to how the maturity is calculated now.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-08-26 20:41:57 UTC | #19

Good question. 

I cannot seem to find the exact thread on Dscvr.one. but the inspiration for this thread is that Dom was on a dscvr thread with folks and he both received some feedback and said foundation would propose some changes.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-08-26 21:26:34 UTC | #20

I would not make any changes to this amazing neurons tokenomics, but only few technical upgrades.
As it is design now, it offer the best of all worlds.  People can create multiple neurons and set them up with different dissolve delay if they think about claiming back their original token amount.  Having 8 years lockup offer more rewards which is normal.  Some people, like me, intend to build a yearly income by leaving the 8 years for ever.  As it reward bow, in 5 years, with reinvesting all the rewards, it will produce the same amount per year as the original amount to create the neuron.  This is huge.  Why would you change such a great system?
The upgrades could be:
Have a huge screen warning with full explanations of the impact when upgrading the dissolve delays, with an Accept button.
Would be also very nice to be able to combine neurons with the highest dissolve delays of the two.
It would not be fair to have people to get in the 8 years in order to get maximum rewards and be able to get out before, even with penalty.  Everybody would do this for sure.

And I will come back with a optional proof of ownership system.  Was thinking about creating a NFT with the account and the owner info where the voting system could give back control of the account to the real owner.  This will be necessary to have mass adoption and remove being scare of loosing everything on a simple mistake, or stolen account, etc…  This will happen and may ruin or seriously damage a life.  But I think Dfinity have enough on their plate for now so this is why I do not push hard for something like this in the near future.  This would be huge as people would feel as safe as a bank account where people cannot loose their account in any way.
If blockchain NFT can proof a piece of art to be the original for ever, I cannot see that all IC engineer cannot create a proof of ownership somehow, which is closely the same.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-08-26 23:01:31 UTC | #21

 Hi John 
Nice to meet you. Transferability is already built-in into the NNS through following another neuron. If one bad actor wants to "buy" sufficient votes, he could set up a smart-contract of sorts that would require other neurons to follow a specific neuron for a specific time with the promise of "rewarding" such neurons.   Am I mistaken?

-------------------------

Trevor | 2021-08-29 05:43:45 UTC | #22

I have some non-technical thoughts on ICP tokenomics informed from a few friends I have in other crypto spaces and my own reading on how laypeople perceive tokenomics. There are two big buckets I'd like to bring up and hopefully whoever replies can cure my ignorance. 

Firs I think what confuses me is how to quantify the gap between new ICP being created and ICP being burned for cycles. If you look at [https://ic.rocks/charts](https://ic.rocks/charts), the rate of new ICP being burned vs minted isn't even on the same planet The outlier best day in August is 600 ICP burned and the day with the least amount of ICP Minted was ~11,000. With some days being less than 1 ICP burned daily. 

Even with the cherry picked best values so far for inflation, that's an 18x amount of ICP that would need need to be burned daily to get to deflationary. However, that goal post will keep moving as more node providers come online. Because of that, part of me feels like fairly high inflation will happen forever.  A lot of people in the crypto world are obsessed with inflation rates, they view cryptocurrency as a hedge to inflation and view it in opposition to fiat monetary policy. ICP does not appear to currently work this way, which I think turns off a lot of people. I say this as someone who is a big fan of ICP and thinks that 100x usage of the mainnet is realistic. 

Even then, the numbers don't add up one way or another. Are most rewards given to neurons or to data centers? How is the rate for rewards to data centers made? Is there an idea of what % of ICP will be minted from neurons vs rewards to data centers? I assume Dfinity has at least an estimate of that and could clarify the direction of new ICP being minted in the short-medium term. If it's largely just from neurons then acceleration of minting will inevitably slow down and it's not a concern, if it's largely from data centers, then there should be more clear info on how they are rewarded and how those rewards will work over time.

The second bucket is the big elephant in the room for some people. The allocation of ICP tokens is kind of a mystery. Talking to a couple people I was able to find the Genesis allocation, but it seems clear that the current allocation is a big question mark. This big question mark is clear from messaging a few different people within the community, and I think where a large source of FUD is created from, and could be stopped with clearer communication/more transparency. 

In a [recent interview](https://youtu.be/JLanS3ueYV0?t=1647) Dominic Williams stated "For the record, the Dfinity Foundation did not sell a single ICP for five weeks after Genesis. And in fact, founder and founder levels, employees were locked up for the first week, so clearly didn't we cause the fall in price, or the rise." This leads to even more confusion in my opinion. It's not clear what percentage of ICP is held by the foundation or employees currently, and if so, what percentage is locked up in neurons and for how long of a delay? What happened after 5 weeks? I assume this is just an off the cuff statement, but it's a pretty specific time frame and odd not to just say founders, founder levels and employees largely had/have their ICP staked away.

TLDR I think that it should be made clear what amount of ICP is held by the Foundation, the Association and from Founder level employees, otherwise it's going to inevitably create FUD from misinformed or malicious people. Additionally, most people in the larger cryptospace view cryptocurrency in relation to fiat, and the way ICP does inflation and deflation, while quite brilliant in my opinion, doesn't really give a clear signal to what inflation currently is and how it will go down, given it doesn't seem transparent how new data centers get added, or their rewards. It's easy to just say over time more ICP will be burned into cycles, but the math doesn't add up as how I currently understand it. While I am not advocating some massive deflation, from my readings it is clear the larger crypto community prefers projects that are either deflationary in nature, or with an inflation rate below recent trends of USD.

Lastly, I'd like to just thank everyone at Dfinity and whoever reads this post. Diego and company have done an amazing job on the subreddit, but I felt since this post took quite a bit of time, it made sense to post it here. My apologies if this is pretty open ended, is says you can help by asking questions so I asked many!

@jwiegley @johan @diegop thank you for asking the community to offer ideas related to tokenomics.  I think you are doing an excellent job of seeking feedback and responding to concerns.

In my opinion we should not make significant changes the tokenomics.  I don’t really like the idea of making it easy to transfer neurons or allowing shorter unstake periods with penalties.  The rules are clear in the Dfinity publications on this topic and every investor should DYOR to know what they are signing up for when they stake ICP.  This project is way too young to be making those kinds of changes to the tokenomics and I would prefer to give it more time.  

I think there are better ways to make it attractive to stake ICP.  A stated goal is to achieve 90% staking.  I would like to see metrics published by Dfinity foundation that can be tracked to understand progress toward that 90% goal.  If we are not measurably moving in that direction, then think about what can be done to make it more attractive to stake ICP and participate in governance.  Do this by rewarding existing participants in governance.  Two examples of this come to mind.  

First, there is a deadline for claiming ICP minted at genesis.  Make a concerted effort to ensure that every genesis recipient has fair opportunity to claim their ICP.  However, the ICP that remains unclaimed (which is currently significant) could be redistributed to investors who have already staked long term.  Any current neuron with a dissolve delay more than 4 years means the investor has signaled intent for long term participation of governance, which is the stated goal of the tokenomics of ICP.  Every neuron with a dissolve delay of more than 4 years was configured that way by individual investors after genesis.  Reward those investors.  Redistribute the ICP proportional to the existing voting power of neurons.  Redistribute the ICP into locked and voting neurons with an 8 year dissolve delay.  Set a deadline for when the redistribution will occur and publicize it widely well in advance.  Generate a buzz.  KYC, if needed.  I think this will cause a sudden rush to stake liquid ICP and for investors to increase dissolve delay of their existing neurons. 

The second example is related to the fact that the Dfinity foundation is a large holder of ICP.  I don’t know how much of it is currently staked, but if some of it is not staked long term then consider staking it and redistributing the monthly rewards to other long term stakers.  Do this every month for the next 4 years.  Make it a significant perk for long term investors to participate in governance.

Both of these ideas accomplish multiple stated goals in the tokenomics without substantially changing the tokenomics.  This is a way to make it significantly more attractive for investors to stake ICP and participate in governance.  This accelerates the rate at which decentralization of the internet computer will occur.  This takes liquid ICP off the market, which will cause a price increase.  This moves us toward the 90% ICP staking goal faster.  

I do not believe that the tokenomics need to change.  I do believe that we need to give it more time for the tokenomics take effect as designed.  If anything needs to be done, then make it more attractive to achieve the 90% staking goal faster.

-------------------------

integral_wizard | 2021-08-29 11:27:05 UTC | #24

Shouldn't the actual value/code running on ICP accomplish this? You need to burn ICP for cycles. Adoption will bring a natural deflationary side

-------------------------

integral_wizard | 2021-08-29 11:38:13 UTC | #25

Agree with what you said. Regarding the second point, ic.rocks should be accurate. Although  the neuron 4000-4000 is a mystery to me.
https://ic.rocks/neuron/allocations

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-08-29 13:23:04 UTC | #26

Seconding this. Tokenomics as designed and publicized were a big draw for me as an early investor, and all of the tokenomics parameters seem very nicely-calibrated for the IC in steady-state. As Wenzel notes, neuron transfer is worrisome for the security reasons outlined in previously published Dfinity materials.

If the goal is to get to 90% staking and encourage decentralization, then that's where the focus should be - how do we make staking and participating in governance more attractive?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-08-29 13:37:13 UTC | #27

Hi @wpb 
I read carefully your post and agree for most part. I also, have expressed not to make any important changes as we got in with the actual rules.
My question to you is Why do you say the goal is to have 90% stake in the neurons?
If this is to create an artificial value to ICP by creating low ICP available supply, I do not think this is a good strategy.
With mass adoption and IC technical success that it should have, having many ICP in circulation, thus creating large volume for trading, is a better option on the long run.  Have some ICP available for large institution to get in and hold long term.
Creating artificial value by locking the vast majority , on hype or whatever else, is never a good way on long term.  And the way I see it, Dfinity (and yourself and myself) are looking for a very long term.  So long that I have no intention to unlock my 8 years ever. This is how much I believe in the IC project.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-08-29 14:06:51 UTC | #28

Good question.  Dfinity stated the goal in the article linked below in the section toward the end titled Calculating Voting Rewards. In my opinion, this goal is foundational to the tokenomics design.  This article had the biggest influence on my decision to invest and stake because it lays out the tokenomics rules and goals in detail.

https://link.medium.com/NQBEzKfn7ib

“Calculating Voting Rewards, Overview
We begin by deciding that 90 percent of the total supply of ICP should be locked in neurons. Then we estimate what returns, in the form of newly minted ICP, must be provided to those locking their ICP to incentivize 90 percent participation. This allows us to calculate the total rewards that must be paid if we are successful. We then decide to distribute this quantity of newly minted ICP regardless of the current level of participation, such that participants will receive larger rewards until participation reaches 90 percent, allowing the markets to persuade those who are not currently participating to participate.”

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-08-29 14:21:00 UTC | #29

I, also have read that document before investing.  I think we have 2 different interpretation for the 90%.
As they wrote "We begin by deciding that 90 percent of the total supply of ICP should be locked in neurons".  I read it as they have made their calculation while thinking the probability that 90% of ICP will be locked at some time.  But I do not read it as this is a goal.  It was an assumption to me. But I can be wrong.
Still, I think having a good supply for the market is good for stability and avoid manipulation.  If only 10% of the supply is available on the market and 2 or 3 whales are part of that 10%, they will do whatever they want with the price.
Market will decide at the end.  Will be interesting to see in 2 - 3 years

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-08-29 17:43:24 UTC | #30

Hmmm.  I suppose you are right.  I hadn’t considered that idea previously and I would not want that to happen.  Vote following through liquid democracy should be a personal and independent decision, not a contractual obligation for some service provided.  I suppose this is a good reason it should not be visible which neurons are following which neurons, which is not possible today.  I believe this is why ic.rocks and others cannot determine the liquid voting power of specific neurons.

This is a good place to introduce another request for the Dfinity foundation.  I don’t know if anyone else has already defined a term for this yet, but for now I will call it liquid voting power.  Liquid voting power is the overall total voting power of a neuron inclusive of its own voting power and the total voting power it obtains from all vote followers in the liquid democracy model.  

I think it is important to be able to track the liquid voting power of neurons.  I think only Dfinity foundation can/should make this metric visible.  The stated goal is decentralization over time.  This will happen.  The only time in IC history that individual neurons should have greater than 51% liquid voting power should be Dfinity foundation in the early days.  As decentralization occurs, we will need metrics that enable visibility to which neurons are gaining enough liquid voting power to control the NNS.

-------------------------

crabtr26 | 2021-08-29 15:49:24 UTC | #31

Seconding this. I came here thinking I wanted neurons to be freely traded, but after reading some of the other comments I agree that the security concerns make sense. I don’t like the idea of being able to unlock staked neurons early, even for a penalty. I would much prefer to see a streamlined way to transfer ownership of an existing neuron to a beneficiary in the event of a death, sickness, etc. I think many people in the community, myself included, are not planning to dissolve our neurons ever. We definitely do not want to rely on passing down Yubi keys.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-08-29 16:25:02 UTC | #32

Just wanted to add my support for Wenzel’s proposal. I think being able to monitor the Liquid Voting Power (LVP?) of a neuron would be useful for a lot of reasons.

It would be really interesting to watch an organization’s LVP move up or down in real time. Especially as the network matures and more influencers become active in the community.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-08-29 17:38:12 UTC | #33

Agree with measuring "liquid voting power" - makes a lot of sense.

-------------------------

allwynpinto | 2021-08-29 17:44:30 UTC | #34

I had bought it to this forum about airdrops for investors who hold for more than 5 years+ 
This will woo more people to be invested in the nns..
Airdrops is a thing that attracts the market. ICP has everything in it, However right now what ICP needs is big quality investors locking in for long term which will enhance the project and also lift up the morale of all developers at the same😊

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-08-29 18:09:49 UTC | #35

Make neurons transferable (as NFT) and then you can sell them on secondary markets at a discount, where the future ICP will be discounted via the market's time-value of money. 

If the protocol forbids neuron transferability, people will have canisters own neurons that can be transfered like NFT ("wrapped neuron"). If IC prevents canisters from owning neurons, external blockchains will implement chain key crypto where smart contracts will wrap the neurons into NFTs (similar to how IC plans to control native Bitcoin with canisters).

The long term security of the protocol cannot assume neurons will never be transferable. The irony is IC's chain key crypto has forever destroyed non-transferability for all crypto assets. Everything will be transferable and liquid in the future.

Therefore we should just accept this reality and model security based on neurons being transferable, and make them transferable ASAP rather than waste time with early unlock penalties that force the protocol to determine the time-value of money, when that is a job for markets.

[quote="Trevor, post:22, topic:6159"]
usage of the mainnet is realistic.
[/quote]

Seconding this. The stated inflation rate is 10% annually for the first 8 years. So each day reward is 10%/365*current_total_supply if I understand this code correctly https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/e362530172c44679313b1b7fca1e90d8967545d8/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L5297. That means reward for each day increase if the total supply is increasing. What I don't know is whether the 10% rewards include node provider reward. I hope the foundation could make the reward info for node provider a public info, which might also incentivize people to become node prioviders.

-------------------------

wang | 2021-08-29 23:45:30 UTC | #37

I support the idea of "liquid voting power". It would serve as a leaderboard to incentivize independent parties to gain followers.

In addition, I would like to request neuron naming (perhaps the NNS team is tracking this issue).

After reading the entire thread I have to say thank you to all of the people putting some serious time into thinking through their ideas and presenting them here. Also thank you to the Dfinity Team for demonstrating that they want to move in the direction of the community driving the future of the IC.

Given the current discussion above, this is a summary of my current stance on tokenomics:

1. Like @wpb and some others have said I agree that we should not make any changes to the current programmatic mechanics of the tokenomics. I think more time should be given to capture some metrics to determine how the tokenomics are actually playing out. Without some metrics on the key variables, making changes is somewhat uninformed (if not completely random). This is dangerous because the "levers" and the strength of those levers aren't fully understood.

2. I agree that more metrics should be made transparent. The primary ones being:
     a. Percent of ICP locked up over varying time periods (this would answer some of the behavioral 
         questions that @lastmjs has asked above), 
     b. A measurement of neuron liquid voting power so that a "take over" of the IC can be defended 
         against.
     c. Some analysis should be completed to confirm whether it is possible to reach ICP price appreciation 
        (or even stable) state through the mechanics of the deflationary/inflationary mechanics. @Trevor 
         asks some good questions on this above.

3. I'm really on the fence regarding unclaimed ICP. I can't decide if it should just be left alone, burned, or re-distributed. This is a really tough one that probably has some legal issues that vary by country/jurisdiction.

4. Due to the security reasons expressed, I think we should do whatever we can to avoid the creation of a Neuron trading market.

These are some really tough concepts that will take a lot of smart people debating in order to come to the best possible outcome.

I  fully agree with this. I think the tokenomics model is working just fine

icpmax | 2021-08-30 07:20:47 UTC | #40

How do people still think it's good token economics. I was just reading for days but could not resist anymore ICP has terrible token economics.
First, let's look at this;
Dscvr thread: here you go fools .
and, now the current situation is for a 4 years seeds (the ones bought each 0.03$) going to dump on current buyers. It's like a leaking boat and if there is not any investment coming people going to lose 70% of their money at the end of 4 years. Besides any gain, it's really risky, and when more people learn this they are going to avoid investment on icp, without the help of the community, icp is going to leak more like a snowball effect. Even after 4 years foundation etc is going to mint 300M coins? is it like a joke? nothing is transparent about token economics since day1 its understandable with that much-broken level.  I believe that ICP not going to survive well with that broken token economics people are not blind as creators of this thinks. 
Honestly, I have no idea how to fix this but maybe stopping the aging of seed neurons and increasing the maturity rate of neurons created after launch as 2-3x maybe can lead to a bit equal distribution. 
There should be 75-80% of coins on exchanges, not 10%. It was a broken launch, who launches with 0.005% coin on the first day and make their coin on the top 3 as there was 40$B investment on it at the first day (probably the real market cap was around 200M$) and with showing circulating supply 127M and dump other 10-20M coins weeks later. It's has terrible token economics and with this level of tech, it could be in the top 3 for real atm. Really sad these happened to ICP.

@icpmax,  I'm having a tough time following this, but I think your primary critique is about the token distribution--not the tokenomics. We can't do anything about the distribution of ICP at this point. And that's not what this thread is about. This thread is about tweaking the set of incentives around the ICP token to meet some desired purpose (whether it is to increase the security of the network, to increase demand for token, etc.).

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-08-30 14:26:09 UTC | #42

For most, I disagree with @icpmax.  Those seed investors (which I am not and have bought my few first ICP at 320$) had invested 10k, 30k or whatever (at .03 cents each ICP) back years ago when Internet Computer was only on paper, not much more then a dream.  These investors had the most faith that the dream would come true. Without these investors, IC would just not exist.  Now, if these investors believed enough to pour thousand of dollars in a dream, why would they sell now that IC is alive and work amazingly? These people believe much more in Crypto then fiat money.  Why would they sell?  To buy other cryptos? or get back to fiat?  Where will they invest their fiat money obtained from that dump?  What is better then ICP as investment for the next 20 years?  If you have a clue, let me know, I may be interested.
I just believe (but may be wrong) these seeds will invest most of their new obtained ICP in the NNS and have great returns, while the price would go up.
I don't see many other ways (other then Dfinity have done) to obtain funds for a project on paper only. 
Our risk to invest in ICP now, a great working layer 1 network, is millions times less then for these seeds investors at the time.
What I found to be bad at launch wad the lack on clear information, which is a general statement and complain as I can see.  Now, we have to live with it and go forward, if we believe in the technology of course, which I do from the very beginning I learn about IC. (When ICP was selling at 320$ back in May)
This is my thinking but respect yours.

If the penalty were so severe that it ate into the principal, and if the totality of said penalty were burned or distributed to, say, only locked neurons, then MAYBE I'd agree.  But even then it's a maybe.  

And regarding neuron transfers... one thought is for neurons to be transferrable to other II's that are subordinate to my master II (i.e., created by me via my master II).  And perhaps there needs to be a rule that a neuron can only be transferred to a subordinate II that has been in existence for a year (or some other arbitrary time)... or perhaps the % of the neuron that can be transferred is dependent upon the age of the subordinate II.

I'm not a fan of transferring neurons, except for legacy/estate needs.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-08-30 18:09:51 UTC | #44

Anyone who believes neurons should not be transferable is making the same mistake as Bitcoin's decaying block reward: it is a bad security assumption for the future. 

If an external blockchain implements chain key crypto and private smart contracts, one will be able to create neurons on addresses controlled by the external blockchain. Then later one could transfer ownership of this neuron on the other blockchain, while on the IC it appears nothing happened. Only the buyer of the neuron would know the transfer happened, preventing NNS voters from blacklisting transferred neurons.

If the security of the IC/NNS depends on neurons not being transferrable, it faces a ticking time bomb of another blockchain implementing CKC and private smart contracts. If just 1% of locked ICP wants to be sold annually, that is still a huge market to build a product for. Then an attacker could still perform whatever governance attack they want, while only losing the discount on locked ICP. The discount will still be non-trivial, because neuron sellers have to incentivize buyers over just buying their own ICP and staking. Plus, the sale won't happen instantly, so the attacker still risks the price of ICP declining after a bad proposal is passed.

The counter to the governance attack is for neuron buyers to be aware of the voting status of the neurons they wish to buy. Buyers will not want to buy neurons that are actively voting because of the risk of becoming a bagholder after a governance attack. I expect neuron markets to prevent listing of neurons for sale that are actively voting to save buyers the trouble of manually looking that up.

If the IC directly allows neuron transfers, it could implement some light rules/restrictions to enhance security, that are not enough to incentive the creation of an external neuron market. For instance, adding small delays to voting/following/transferring actions could prevent attackers from instantly voting then liquidating a neuron. Or create a special neuron state that allows it to be transferred but not vote. It would be better for the IC to have some control over neuron markets than for them to have free reign on external blockchains.

MichaelAnnh | 2021-08-31 14:34:45 UTC | #45

I personally think that other projects like Polkadot raise some sincere questions regarding the tokenomics and governance: 

Here is the [link](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance) on Polkadot's governance mechanism.

> To vote, a voter generally must lock their tokens up for at least the enactment delay period beyond the end of the referendum. This is in order to ensure that some minimal economic buy-in to the result is needed and to dissuade vote selling.
It is possible to vote without locking at all, but your vote is worth a small fraction of a normal vote, given your stake. At the same time, holding only a small amount of tokens does not mean that the holder cannot influence the referendum result, thanks to time-locking. You can read more about this at [Voluntary Locking](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#voluntary-locking).

> Example:
> 
> Peter: Votes `No` with 10 DOT for a 128 week lock period  => 10 * 6 = 60 Votes
> 
> Logan: Votes `Yes` with 20 DOT for a 4 week lock period => 20 * 1 = 20 Votes
> 
> Kevin: Votes `Yes` with 15 DOT for a 8 week lock period => 15 * 2 = 30 Votes

So that raises for me the first question: **Why are we afraid of shorter lock-up periods?** Polkadot shows exactly how this could be solved. 

If one doesn't lock up his DOT for a vote, he'll only get voting power with a factor of 0.1. = > 128weeks against zero delay equals a factor of 60(!) in voting power weight difference.
That means someone who locks up 1Dot for 128weeks has got the same voting power as someone with 60DOT. 
In my opinion that should be enough to actually counter the argument: "Only long-term holders should be able to vote/benefit from staking etc."
The huge advantage of a system like Polkadot is the that it actually let's everyone benefit. ICP feels more like a punishment with the 6month lock-up atm. I understand the arguments, but **in comparison with Polkadot we should ask ourselves: Why?** 

I don't have a good answer for this. Polkadot differs between staking and governance voting. I know that it's not the case here. However even **staking is possible with a lock-up delay of 28days on Polkadot.** 
And I actually don't see any argument why that shouldn't be brought to ICP. 

If we don't find proper solutions to these questions, we'll probably end up like cowards. The only argument I can find is that a minimum lock of 6month, brings stability to the price, since ICP are longer out of circulation.
That's also the complete opposite of what we should oppose to the fiat system: If we make it hard to liquidiate, because we're afraid that the price could go down, what does that say about the system and ourselves? Are we that afraid that the free market could punish us for some flaws?  
It's like a country embracing capital controls in order to prevent capital flight and help the exchange rate... 
That's normally a completely desperate act. Look at some countries with high inflation and ask yourselves how that turned out for them. 

_______

Next thing: 6month minimum lock up in combination with 1ICP treshold for spawning a neuron
Who benefits more? Someone with 1000 ICP or someone with 10ICP?
Someone with 1k ICP and an annual inflation rate of 10% would generate ~8.3 ICP a month or 2 ICP a week. With 7 days delay for unlocking the new neuron, he'd actually have much liquid ICP available. He could restake them again to earn interest on his interest (making him benefit even more), or he could also sell them, which completely counters many of the arguments. I've already described it [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/staking-imbalance-via-1icp-treshold/6375). 

The [staking guide](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/staking-imbalance-via-1icp-treshold/6375) explains it:

```
There is a “Spawn Neuron” button that is grayed out until I have at least 1 ICP in rewards. You can compute how many newly minted ICP you have by taking your maturity % and multiplying by the number of ICP you have staked in the neuron. Once your ICP rewards are greater than 1 ICP it will let you spawn a new neuron with the newly minted ICP staked in it. Once you spawn a new neuron it will have a 7-day dissolve delay after which you can either send it to a different wallet or add it to your existing staked wallet.
```

Someone with only 10ICP would have to wait much longer to be able to earn interest on his interest. Futhermore he would also have less liquidity than someone with a high stake, earning the 1ICP really fast.
What did the person with "only" 10 ICP do wrong? Right, he didn't have as much money or wasn't as lucky as someone else to get such a high amount of ICP that early. Now he is punished, and the whale benefits exponentially. I don't have to explain that even the current banking system is more equal since we all get the same low interest rate. 
I personally see it this way: A while could dump on the market with his freshly minted ICP (staking reward) while I still can't spawn a new Neuron. Here you are clearly prefered if you have a high stake or to turn it around:
=> One actually gets punished for only having a small stake. 
**IMO this is an oligarchy on steroids.** 

Neuron age is an interesting concept, however if we bring it back to the inequality discussion it's not clear if that isn't exactly the opposite of the wanted effect.

Let's take Dfinitys stake (Idk how  high atm): Probably 20% of the Genesis supply
If that is staked => 10% a year. 
20% on ~400Mio ICP => 80 Mio ICP 
10% a year => 8Mio ICP a year (8Mio ICP @60$ are 480 Mio$ a year from staking only(!))
Now additional benefits due to Neuron age (one of the first stakers and 1ICP treshold liquidity, earning interest on interest) => Dfinity can easily pay staff from staking only. How should that thing ever become decentralized with that whale tokenomics? 

___________

@wpb
I have to disagree with your statement:

>  we should not make significant changes the tokenomics.


@BrianGaller
You've written, that you wanted actual data first. Fair way to go. However I don't read that there is sensitivity on this matter. I read many comments which say the following: Wait, let's watch it. etc. 
And that's what really concerns me. 

Having bad tokenomics is one thing, but not seeing the flaws is a whole other story. I've actually never seen a project like that: Without doubt the greatest tech. Without doubt horrible tokenomics, and I clearly stand to my opinion (my provided facts should speak for themselves). @Trevor wrote another great comment in here about some more flaws. 

If ICP wants to succeed it will need great tech, great tokenomics and community support. Putting it on the long bench and thinking that this will somehow fix itself, will let the problems appear squared in a few years. By embracing an oligarchy, ICP loses points to tokenomics and this thing will come back like a boomerang after years. Benefiting the whales will let us lose community support (think of our fiat system). Maybe not today, but it will get worse with each year. Look at the wealth distribution in the US. ICP can do this within 5 years. If you don't believe me, take some numbers and calculate them in Matlab via interest of interest on high stakes. 

_______

tldr: IMO ICP tokenomics is horrible. Without major governance/staking upgrades, the system could set itself up for failure. 

Proposals:
- Polkadot governance should be studied and partly copied to ICP
- 1 ICP treshold for spawning a new Neuron should be lowered, or completely abolished (better). 
- 6 month minimum lock-up period should be significantly lowered
- Neuron Following should be decentralized to more parties
- More transparancy regarding staking stats is required (already in discussion in here?) 
- Discussion on how to avoid oligarchic structures is required
- Discussions about the treasury should be established (e.g. treasury votes with ICP?)

wpb | 2021-09-01 12:08:51 UTC | #46

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on these topics.  I respect your opinion.  I just wanted to say that I agree with one of your proposals, which is that the 1 ICP threshold to spawn a neuron does disproportionally benefit larger token holders who are compounding their voting rewards and are willing to manually spawn, dissolve, and top up as quickly as possible.  For anyone that is not compounding, it makes no difference as the reward rate of return is equal (assuming equivalent dissolve delay and age) no matter how many ICP are locked.  In practice, I suspect a lot of folks are compounding and want the compounding to happen automatically.  It is my hope that the automatic compounding feature that Dfinity foundation is working on will be implemented on a daily basis so this issue goes away.  If it doesn't address this issue, I think a strong case should be made for enabling compounding to equally benefit everyone no matter how many ICP are staked.  There are probably multiple ways of accomplishing that goal and I would advocate for Dfinity foundation to pursue that type of proposal regarding the tokenomics.

Edit:  Another way to give large and small token holder equality from compounding would be to change the definition of when the Spawn Neuron is allowed.  The fact that it is pegged to 1 ICP is what creates the inequality.  If it were pegged to Maturity (the ratio between ICP reward and ICP staked) then that inequality would go away.

-------------------------

iBardak | 2021-08-31 17:07:13 UTC | #47

I believe that in order to achieve the maximum number of stacked neurons, it is necessary to offer a non - proprietary value. Let's think about it? What can be valuable for a true fan of the IC ecosystem? Allocations in startups. We need to somehow encourage true stakeholders by providing guaranteed allocations in projects that are interesting for them. What can be the model? Let's fantasize. You can add the Noblesse parameter equal to the Maturity parameter. From which it will be possible to spawn a sub-neuron. This sub-neuron will be able to vote for a certain project and get a proportional guaranteed allocation. After voting, the sub-neuron disappears. It is important that these neurons cannot leave their host to avoid speculation and market valuation. I believe that it will also be beneficial for the project owners.
First of all: this will give them the power of public recognition.
Secondly: the owners of strong sub-neurons cannot be weak hands

There is an expression Canadian people are saying:  "Don't try to use the shovel before it snow".  We can assume and try to solve tons of problems that may never arise.  Good for discussion though.  My stance, for what it is worth, is wait and see how it goes and solve problems as they arise.  So far, I am only impressed about IC technology, Dfinity and every one involved (developers, etc..).  Neurons rewards were design to rewards more investors with long term view.  But short term are quiet well serve as well to me.  Whales (I am not at all) are whales for a reason. They believe and invested in a paper only system.  Now, I would think they have all incentive to have IC to work at his best, to get their investment at his best as well.

-------------------------

Trevor | 2021-09-01 04:07:15 UTC | #49

I'd like to point out Diego explained most ICP minted are from neuron rewards not node providers, so part of my concerns are alliviated. 

I think personally there are several different topics here being discussed and they should go into relevant threads. I would call mine "Inflationary rate." 

While I'm aware the ecosystem will lead to ICP getting burned, it would be good to get some numbers behind that so the math works out. I think this ties into better understanding of costs and what it would take to have tokens burned = tokens minted with a 5-10% inflation rate plus node provider fees.

-------------------------

MichaelAnnh | 2021-09-01 08:46:39 UTC | #50

I absolutely agree on your view that automatic compounding doesn't solve the issue. It actually further embraces the problem. Now you've to take a look on your neuron once in a while. High stakes might forget to spawn new neurons. There is also human work (still really low amount) in the process, which  slows it a bit down. 

With automatic compouding they can lean back while the ICP itself helps them to use the oligarchic structure perfectly with zero additional effort. That's insane.
No wonder that whales want automatic compounding => The rich want to get richer, and that as easily as possible. I've written that exactly in my other thread.

> Furthermore what I didn’t mention is that the period for reaching the 1 ICP gets smaller and smaller, the higher the staked amount gets. => That even puts more dynamic into the exponential curve for whales.
Imagine an automatic script which does that after a few votes/days.

Could you explain your statement more exactly, pls? It's interesting:

> If it were pegged to a ratio between ICP reward and ICP staked then that inequality would go away.

The problem with this is, that someone with a high stake, could simply split his neuron up a few times and avoid getting into the problem. That might incentivice to get smaller neurons and put less dynamic into the exponential curve. However if you take a look at my example in the other thread, you'll see that the difference of someone having 2 neurons with *amount*/2 or one neuron with *amount* is not that severe. 

It will get interesting if someone is forced to split up his neurons to an amount equal of a smaller stakeholder. However this would need serious calculations, and further analysis if there is a way to simply avoid it. If someone with 1k ICP will get the same percentual reward after the same amount of time as someone with 10ICP, the system is fair (excluding Neuron age at that point).

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-09-01 12:15:54 UTC | #51

Hey @MichaelAnnh, I just want to clarify what I was trying to say in the previous post…

I am in favor of automatic compounding.

I am in favor of compounding methods that ensure reward rate of returns benefit large and small stake holders equally.  Daily automatic compounding achieves this goal, but there are manual methods as well.

If automatic compounding is not going to be implemented, then pegging the manual Spawn Neuron action to a fixed Maturity threshold instead of a fixed ICP reward threshold also achieves this goal of equality.  However, pegging to a fixed Maturity creates new problems such as how long it will take to achieve that Maturity.

-------------------------

Wow - a lot of very thoughtful discussion here. In separate posts to come soon, I'd like to offer my own two cents. But first, I thought it would be useful to all involved here to try to summarize ideas raised so far (apologies in advance for not tagging all of who have advocated support for given ideas - the forum here doesn't seem to permit tagging more than 10 members in a single post):


**Some key ideas raised to this point:**
* **1.** Re-calibrating **ICP inflation and burning parameters** - to achieve today something closer to a non-inflationary supply of ICP (@Trevor, @BrianGaller - who advocates for some study to be conducted to see whether this is needed).
* **2.** Providing the **ability to transfer neurons** to another - to the beneficiary of an estate if need be (@wpb), but also potentially to anyone else at any time, possibly with penalties (@Alixthe, @talkingant).
* **3.** Creating visibility into "**liquid voting power**" - both to provide general awareness of where control of the NNS lies at any given moment (@wpb), and also providing clarity regarding who owns how much ICP (@Trevor).
* **4.** Finding **better ways to achieve the 90% staking goal** - both to decentralize faster and in the process achieving certain guarantees against 51% attacks (@wpb).
* **5.** Supporting **shorter ICP lockup periods** in staking (@MichaelAnnh).


**Some other good ideas raised to this point:**
* **6.** Fine-tuning **staking reward mechanics** - namely, automatic compounding of staking rewards, and/or changing the threshold for spawning new neurons, so as not to disadvantage smaller ICP stakers (@wpb, @MichaelAnnh).
* **7.** Providing greater control over one's own neurons - i.e., **combining and/or splitting neurons** (@wpb).
* **8.** Ensuring that **centralized exchanges reflect only circulating supply of ICP** (unlocked supply), rather than all supply (@tlbalog).

Please do let me know if I've in any way inadvertently misrepresented anyone's position here, and I will undertake to adjust. Thoughts on some of these topics to come soon.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-01 21:24:31 UTC | #53

On **point 1. - recalibrating ICP inflation and burning parameters:**

I believe that current parameters are quite nicely calibrated for the steady-state economics that we might anticipate for the IC. I've reached out to both @Trevor and @BrianGaller directly on Telegram to share thoughts, and invite anyone who may be interested to connect with me on Telegram (not sharing here, as thoughts have implications for ICP's price, and this Forum isn't meant for price-talk).

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-01 15:20:34 UTC | #54

On **point 2. - providing the ability to transfer neurons to another**: 

I definitely think it's worthwhile to consider how to transfer to the beneficiary of an estate. This would provide peace of mind, and if designed nicely, could, I would imagine, be made hard to abuse.

On the idea of enabling neuron transfer in general, the security implications are worrisome. But I think @talkingant raises some really interesting points. It hadn't occurred to me that, if another blockchain platform were to adopt chain key technology, users of that blockchain could create transferable neurons there, with no way to know or mitigate on the IC itself. I'm quite curious to learn more about how this would work. Because if neuron transfer really can't be prevented, then yes, much better to prepare for the inevitable, sooner rather than later, and find other ways to mitigate the unavoidable risks of neuron transfer.

Still, even if chain key's adoption by another platform would enable neuron transfer, it will most likely take a long time for other platforms to adopt chain key. So we have time to figure out how to manage associated risks.

So I think we're still better off at the moment aiming to keep neuron transfer disabled, until we can find workable ways to mitigate risks - risks that really could undo the IC, if not managed properly.

Only once we've found appropriate mitigations - and just as soon as we have - then I think it would be great to enable neuron transfer.. I think the novel creative opportunities represented by neuron transfer could be significant.. just need to make sure we do this in a safe way.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-01 15:22:46 UTC | #55

On **point 3. - creating visibility into “liquid voting power"**:

I think this is a great, uncontroversial idea that should be pursued without hesitation.

Same goes for **point 4. - Finding better ways to achieve the 90% staking goal.**

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-01 15:26:19 UTC | #56

On **point 5. - supporting shorter ICP lockup periods in staking**:

I think this is interesting, and worth considering... so long as voting power is sufficiently small for trivial lockup periods so as to prevent interested parties from swooping in to successfully make a quick gain at the expense of those who are invested in the IC's long-term success. I think this idea deserves more thought.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-01 15:29:16 UTC | #57

Finally, I think all of points 6., 7., and 8. are good, fairly uncontroversial ideas:

* 6. Fine-tuning **staking reward mechanics** - namely, automatic compounding of staking rewards, and/or changing the threshold for spawning new neurons so as not to disadvantage smaller ICP stakers.
* 7. Providing greater control over one’s own neurons - i.e., **combining and/or splitting neurons**.
* 8. Ensuring that **centralized exchanges reflect only circulating supply of ICP** (unlocked supply), rather than all supply.

-------------------------

MichaelAnnh | 2021-09-02 10:37:02 UTC | #58

**Point 2:** @ayjayem

I think your whole summary is great and @talkingant actually put some practical insights from the free market into the discussion of this point. I can't speak about the threat of others implementing chain key technology, since my knowledge about it is too low. Your statement was. 
 
> Still, even if chain key’s adoption by another platform would enable neuron transfer, it will most likely take a long time for other platforms to adopt chain key. So we have time to figure out how to manage associated risks.

I think the free market puts pressure on this from another side. p2p and otc deals. Let's take a look at this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICPTrader/comments/pd7519/locked_icp/). 
They talk about selling locked ICP with -50% on spot. People could start to sell Yubikeys/ accounts (secure if the seed is deleted from identity managment /if device is changed) via p2p and otc trades. People might start a huge shadow market for neurons/accounts, without anyone knowing about the actual distribution numbers. 

The irony on this is that many of the fears which are tried to be controlled desperately might become true anyway: People grabing cheap locked ICP and being able to vote. Of course someone would have to accumulate like crazy to start an attack, and in the end there is one question: Why should someone accumulate locked ICP, in order to vote against the ICP? There is no answer to it in the short term. On the long term there is also no answer to it with that lock-up period (playing through some scenarios would be interesting). The only instance being that insane could be a government actively buying ICP at any price in order to censor/mess with it one day. Here comes the PoS vs PoW debate again. 

What this tells us is that **we can't control the free market** and people's behaviour, and we shouldn't try to. That would be the same mistake as central banks trying to print their problems out of their way. They'll just emerge at some other point much worse. We should just **give the whole protocol a great framework, a sort of constitution** which is strong enough to resist governance voting attacks.
IMO that can't be done with the permanent fear that anything could go wrong. There has to be power and courage. We should put faith in people and encourage them in governance voting. We should award them and not punish them with 6month lock-ups and rejecting neuron trading.

Everytime something is strongly forbidden/unwanted , people will find their paths, especially in crypto space. If neuron trading is forbidden like in the example above, the free market will get into p2p/otc trading. 
The next possible approach for the free market: Proxy voting and lending voting rights. Not buying/selling ICP directly, but only votes to certain decisions. 
What prevents someone from calling out a certain amount of money for a certain amount of ICP on the next vote? Nothing. What prevents someone from accepting it? Nothing. That's an infinite story, and the more ICP loses its head in something that can't be controlled, the worse it will get. 

Many of the fears could disperse, via establishing **Point 5** with the **Polkadot approach**. Governance rights via weighted lock-ups. An additional consitutional approach could be that changing the lock-up weights would not only require a simple majority, rather a 2/3 majority. Maker protocol also shows how something could be done: They've got an [emergency shutdown](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/emergency-shutdown/) which can be triggered by a 50k MKR burn deposit (only 5% of the supply). It might not be directly related in terms of topic but it's just another example where people have much more faith in governance, and take responsibility, than our community might assume. **Liberal market + strong governance.**
_______
tldr: The free market will find its paths anyway. We should focus on establishing a great framework for all these processes. ICP should find a way to incentivice people to vote for a bright future and to engage with the protocol in the long term. Not via controlling what can't be controlled: Humans
My comparison with Polkadot in a comment above should show how that could be done (**Point 5**).  

_________
**Point 6:** @wpb 
I'd really like to hear more about automatic compounding. I doubt that it will fix the issue, as I've described above. Just let me know more about it (Calculation, and how it could be made fair). 

Your alternate suggestion is worth a try:

> If automatic compounding is not going to be implemented, then pegging the manual Spawn Neuron action to a fixed Maturity threshold instead of a fixed ICP reward threshold also achieves this goal of equality. However, pegging to a fixed Maturity creates new problems such as how long it will take to achieve that Maturity.

I had time to think about it and I actually don't find any way how that could be used by high stakes to their advantage. If spawning a new neuron is fixed to a certain maturity (e.g. 2.5%), everyone has got the same condition (neuron age not considered here). If 2 Person (A 10 ICP, B 1kICP) decide to stake at the same time, they'll be able to spawn a neuron at the exact same time (e.g at 2.5% maturity). That's fairness. 

If there is concern that the liquidity of ICP by holders (especially big pockets) is decreased, we're at the perfect track. => If someone fears that his advantage isn't here anymore, there might be something we got right. Now we get to a point where the minimum 6month lock-up period could really hurt. 
Assets staked for that amount of time and not getting any liquid ICP that fast because of the 2.5% minimum maturity => That might be too much and it's rather a punishment than an award. 
Here comes **point 5** into play again.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-09-02 11:23:58 UTC | #59

@MichaelAnnh  My definition of automatic compounding is related to making it easier to apply reward ICP to the staked balance of ICP in a neuron.  

Currently it is a manual process since we have to wait for the maturity to represent at least 1 ICP of voting rewards, click Spawn Neuron, go to the new neuron and click Unlock, wait 7 days for the dissolve delay to expire, click Disperse to release that reward ICP out of the new neuron, go back to the parent neuron, and click top up neuron.  It’s just an undesirable way to compound your ICP rewards.  

So automatic compounding would automate these tasks as a minimum solution without changing any of the required steps or timing.

Automatic daily compounding would apply the daily voting rewards to the staked balance instead of building maturity.  It would be an option for people whose goal is to compound instead of liquidate their rewards.  This is an option that should be configurable any time, whether your neuron is locked or dissolving.  The reason this is fair for everyone is that everyone receives the same voting reward rate of return every day no matter how many ICP are staked assuming the same neuron configuration of dissolve delay and age.

I would like to agree with the possible dangers of relying on non-transferability of neurons. My intuition tells me it would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to actually prevent neuron transfers, and I agree with the idea that attempting to prevent them could lead to undesirable outcomes.

I'm not sure if neuron transfers should be fully embraced, or what mitigations should be put in place...but the idea that you can fully prevent transfers should probably be put to rest, and fighting them may prove disastrous.

Deep thought on this is warranted.

Also, just a fun idea to throw out, would anyone be interested in sharing their views on some of these topics in my Demergence podcast? I'd love to get a series of "debates" going on there, perhaps we could do one episode on one controversial topic, and two community members with opposing viewpoints could fight it out in a civil manner. There are many ways to do this, but if people would be interested in coming on Demergence let me know.

Here's some data validating my claims: https://twitter.com/kylelangham/status/1433077356596502528?s=20

Assuming the data is correct, and I'd love to know more about how the data was collected from the author, almost no one is creating neurons for 5, 6, or 7 years. It's as if 5, 6, 7, and 8 year neurons are all equivalent.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-02 13:51:37 UTC | #63

**Point 2:** You raise some more great points, @MichaelAnnh.

First and foremost, I think you're very right to suggest to never underestimate the free market and human ingenuity. Outright bans rarely, if ever, work.. by far the most sustainable solutions are the ones that individuals *want* to use as intended - ones where there's little to gain by skirting or gaming, creating shadow markets in the process, as you note.

So I also very much share your intuition to continue to pursue *economic* guardrails for the security of the IC (the IC already has many of these), rather than strictly prohibitive technical ones: try to make it so that it is in very few parties' *interest* to act counter to what's good for the IC's long-term success. As you note, perhaps only large state actors and others with significant clout and interests beyond the financial would then have any reason to act maliciously. 

I think it's also a great point that it appears that one can in fact already today transfer a neuron, by selling the identity and *deleting the seed phrase.* (Wasn't aware that you could delete the seed phrase - thought that once it was set, it was set for good.. but logging into the Internet Identity app just this morning proved my ignorance here as well!)

In view of all of this, here's an updated stance.

I maintain that we as a community should look to the IC's security first. To the extent that it's currently possible to *discourage* malicious behaviour using technical means - until we figure out a better, more sustainable way - I think we should. In the immediate term, for example, that may mean ensuring that every Internet Identity is created with a seed phrase, and making that seed phrase permanent and impossible to delete.

But at the same time, post-haste, I think we should start looking into longer-term risk mitigations, to prepare for what increasingly seems to be the inevitability that neurons will at some point, maybe sooner rather than later, be transferable. And here, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility, remote as it may seem at the moment, that we *could* encounter malicious behaviour from interested state actors, or other monied parties with non-financial goals. The IC could be world-changing, and very smart global players have already evidenced their own early belief in this too, to date having invested at least hundreds of millions of dollars. So as the IC continues to mature and prove its potential global influence, I don't think we'll be able to rely on ICP buyers' financial self-interest alone.. it may take more than that.

And as soon as we have sound risk mitigations in place, it would be great to enable neuron transfer officially. The creative opportunities could be significant, and should be fully supported, to the extent that it's safe.

Really appreciate your thoughts @MichaelAnnh.. thanks again.

[/quote]

This is an existential question that you should add to your list.  Does having liquid neurons break the underlying incentives of the NNS?  It certainly reduces the effectiveness of the skin-in-the-game mechanism....but by how much?

Could we barbell this so that a market doesn't develop...or at least there is a floor/ceiling or a very narrow market.  If I can always get out of my neuron for N = N - (x * Years staked) where x is the percentage of the underlying that you lose per year then the market that emerges should only be in between that floor and the full amount.  It seems like that market would attract a much smaller participation.

Ultimately though, does any ability to get out of a neuron increase the likely hood of an NNS attack? It does. How much?  I don't have a ton of answers, just trying to document the questions.

Another fun idea: Is anyone interested in having some informal small group video/audio chats, sort of like a Continental Congress or Town Hall? Seems in-person discussions could be very nice since all of the issues here are deep and ideas and solutions complex and nuanced, hard to get it all down in writing.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-09-03 01:24:59 UTC | #66

@ayjayem you have some very good points.  I know you proposed permanent seed phrases for internet identities, but maybe the idea also applies well to individual neurons.  Would anyone ever buy a neuron that has permanent seed phrase?  Not me.  Anybody who knows that seed phrase could take it over.  That would make it a huge personal risk to buy a neuron from someone else.  This seems like it would be an effective deterrent for neuron transferability.

I think very good and interesting points have been made about neuron transfer by many people in this roadmap conversation.  I am eagerly awaiting a response from Dfinity foundation about whether there is anything built into IC technology to deter this activity.  Several people have indicated that neuron transfer is inevitable.  For example, @talkingant argues that "IC’s chain key crypto has forever destroyed non-transferability for all crypto assets".  Do the cryptographers at the Dfinity foundation agree?  Or is there something about chain key cryptography that is not public knowledge or the public doesn't understand yet that prevents this inevitability?  It seems that Dfinity foundation intentionally designed the tokenomics to make it hard to transfer neurons, but I'd like to know if they have anything baked into the technology stack to enforce this tokenomics design principle?  It is a huge team of cryptographers after all and hopefully they already considered these issues.

@lastmjs your idea of a Town Hall is brilliant.  I think it is important to have folks from the Dfinity foundation present because it would help panelists avoid conjecture.  The format would be a good way to further refine the questions, concerns, ideas, and solutions that are being discussed.

-------------------------

MichaelAnnh | 2021-09-03 13:14:48 UTC | #67

The discussion is really great. 

@ayjayem You've proposed the following: 

> To the extent that it’s currently possible to *discourage* malicious behaviour using technical means - until we figure out a better, more sustainable way - I think we should. In the immediate term, for example, that may mean ensuring that every Internet Identity is created with a seed phrase, and making that seed phrase permanent and impossible to delete.

@wpb 's statement is right on this: 

> That would make it a huge personal risk to buy a neuron from someone else. This seems like it would be an effective deterrent for neuron transferability.

@ayjayem you've correctly mentioned, that my approach would be quite liberal. 
At this state, **I'd actually see adding a permanent seed phrase the opposite of what ICP should do**. It's another restriction, another fear that is carried on, further preventing some secondary liquidity. 

IMO neuron trading is a huge opportunity which could embrace a completely new industry and economic system. An opportunity which could bring growth and worth to ICP. I think we agree on this, however we disagree on the path. Maybe I need to research on all of the security concerns, in order to understand your points better. If you've got more infos/statements/a list of concerns, I'd be glad to dive deeper into it. 

Here I can add another crypto project: [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/)
They have got a liquidity pool. If a certain treshold is not sustained, NXM can't be liquidiated directly in the pool. They knew that and helped to actively embrace a secondary market. If people want to get rid of NXM, but the pool MCR (100% I think) isn't met, they can't liquidate directly. 
They wrap NXM to get WNXM and sell it. The market knows this liquidity issue and says: "Well if you want to sell WNXM you'd receive less than with the current pool ratio."  => price difference and sellers actually lose money. There is an economic thinking now. NXM also has governance rights as far as I know. **I've not yet heard that bringing in secondary liquidity had negative impact on voting behaviour**. 
It would be interesting what they say about this concern. 

If this is translated to ICP it would mean that a simple neuron trading plattform could be embraced where there'd be a difference on the spot price according to supply/demand. The market would price in the liquidity and lock- up period. Someone selling will take e.g. -20% on his 2y locked neuron. 

Again, I have to ask: What are the exact concerns, if other projects show much more courage on things like that? If the correct concern is, that someone votes against the protocol, sells his neuron and leaves afterwards, then you always make the statement out of the view of the malicious actor, not out of the view of the potential buyer, who stacks cheap ICP. Their time horizon is probably higher than to the next neuron trade. If they seriously believe in ICP over the long term, they will buy up all the cheap neurons, and let them work for them. They'll try to engage in governance to actually improve the value of ICP. If something like that would come, I'd only buy neurons and not ICP. If they offer me cheap neurons, be sure I'd take them. 

I absolutely agree on your following point:

> And here, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility, remote as it may seem at the moment, that we *could* encounter malicious behaviour from interested state actors, or other monied parties with non-financial goals. The IC could be world-changing, and very smart global players have already evidenced their own early belief in this too, to date having invested at least hundreds of millions of dollars.

We should make some scenarios and ask ourselves how a potential malicious actor could trade/benefit from such a system without risking everything. Im really interested in all the wild scenarios, possibly coupled to insights in ICP security. 

If we take a look at it from the free market again a few things could happen: 
Huge spot difference on neurons to liquid ICP. => People will find a way to use it: Either speculate on falling ICP price/ or buying up cheap neurons. This could actually be a healing process telling us more about ICP itself and how people think about it, than anything in blockchain before. Look on how "On-chain analysis of btc and other assets" suddenly became a completely new phenomenon/analysis tool for traders/analysts etc. What could neuron trading possibly do? This could be huge. 

I see reports of neuron prices in the morning. Wild speculations, analyst coverage and interpretation what this tells us about future ICP price.... never ending possibilities with neuron trading alone. 
For me it's much more a great opportunity than a security issue. 

The free market puts pressure onto things which don't work until they do. That's why people flee out of fiat into crypto. 
We should accept all the signals. By actually not adding a permanent seed phrase we'd say in full consciousness: "Hey, we see it and we actually like neuron trading."
Now adding a permanent seed phrase would create the next wave of anger and could even harm the project: 
"Now they've also taken p2p neuron trading." I already hear it...

A quick response to another statement:
> So as the IC continues to mature and prove its potential global influence, I don’t think we’ll be able to rely on ICP buyers’ financial self-interest alone… it may take more than that.

IMO that can be resolved by great governance + community. If your ICP get coupled to governance rights with an enormous bandwith of voting decisions you can participitate, people will have less incentive to look at prices. => One doesn't give up such a right that simply. I actually don't care if the price moves +50% or  -50% atm, if I look at my ICP holding as a form of democratic right. If we'd flee from a country everytime a government makes a bad decision, we'd be normads again. 
This is another aspect of tokenomics and I'm convinced that great governance will lead to community support, and create inherent value for a project. If ICP goes along this path it will have a bright future. 
I've just seen a [tweet](https://twitter.com/lastmjs/status/1433136780698656770?s=20) of @lastmjs and that's exactly the way to go.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-03 17:17:12 UTC | #68

Thanks for this @MichaelAnnh. It sounds like the key point of difference right now comes down to the actual risks and concerns posed by enabling neuron transfer - we both agree that neuron transfer would be great to enable, so long as it's safe (read: secure against 51% attacks, and generally still conducive to long-term good governance of the IC).

Are you on Telegram? If so, might I suggest that we connect there to discuss - don't want to air possible attack vectors in a public forum.

If you want, you can hit me up at @Ayjayem on Telegram.

MichaelAnnh | 2021-09-03 15:20:21 UTC | #69

I see how your approach fixes the inequality regarding "interest of interest", however it doesn't solve the liquidity advantage for large holders. Large holders simply get liquidity faster due to the 1ICP treshold. Automatic compounding doesn't change that. Of course 10ICP vs 1kICP get the same reward speaking in terms of maturity via compounding, however large holders still reach the 1ICP treshold faster due to their high stake. 

If there is serious market action, high stakes have got a liquidity advantage, which small guys don't have. 
E.g.: ICP rises to 300$ => 1kICP probably gets 1-2 ICP a week. At 300$ that would suddenly be 300$ to 600$ on liquidity in a week. The high stake holder can dump it, the small guy (10ICP) can't (even if it would only be a fraction; we speak about 0.01 to 0.02 ICP a week =>@300$ : 3$ to 6$). 
It's the simple fact that the high stake holder can (and will) use it to realise profit and engage in the market, while the small fish can't. 

This has nothing to do with fairness and leads highly to inequality. Why does someone with a higher stake get that advantage over smaller fish? There is simply no reasonable explanation.

Lowering the treshold, wouldn't make it fair, it would only make it less unfair. 

@wpb Pegging the condition to a fixed maturity would be interesting, as you've suggested. I actually can't think of any scenario on how to get an advantage right now, since each neuron (same age) would get percentual ICP released at the same time. That would be worth a try. However compounding alone won't help. 

___________
@lastmjs
Your townhall proposal is great, and I'll give your podcasts a try.  

@ayjayem Thx for the invitation. I'm looking forward to hearing more about it.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-09-03 17:29:17 UTC | #70

@MichaelAnnh you make an excellent point regarding the liquidity advantage of large stakeholders.  Thank you for illustrating it so well.  

Automatic compounding, whether it is daily or based on a fixed threshold maturity, provides equality for accumulation, but not equality for liquidity.  I'm in favor of equality for both accumulation and liquidity, so I would advocate for a fixed threshold maturity to Spawn Neuron instead of the 1 ICP threshold.  

I think a fixed threshold maturity of 1 % is reasonable (although I personally would not object to it being higher).  At the current voting reward rate of return, a fixed threshold maturity of 1% means neurons with 8 year dissolve delay would be able to Spawn Neuron approx every 12 days and neurons with 6 month dissolve delay would be able to do it every 25 days.  

I have no problem with this difference in timeline because it is another mechanism that makes it more attractive for longer term investing, which is the goal of the tokenomics.  This would not be an inequality in my mind, this is the investment choice that everyone gets to make and it applies equally to everyone.

All of that said, I still really want to advocate for daily automatic compounding for anyone who chooses accumulation as their preferred participation strategy.  My points above are only intended to address the inequality of liquidity between large and small stakeholders.  Implementing a fixed maturity threshold to Spawn Neuron does not negate the ability to also allow automatic compounding or automatic daily compounding.

---

I am definitely not sold on the idea that neurons should be transferrable.  I would only be interested in that idea if the Dfinity foundation confirms that they believe there is a security risk that exists by not making them transferrable and they believe there are no mitigation strategy options.  Unless that happens, I would rather stick to the current tokenomics design which is intended to prohibit neuron transfer due to security risks and the desire to attract long term investors.

To me, the free market trading that should exist is the ICP token, not the neuron.  If an individual decides to participate in governance by staking, then they need to go into that decision with eyes wide open after DYOR.  It's a choice and all investors should understand the commitment and live with the consequences.  I don't even have sympathy for seed investors (etc) on this point because part of their investment risk was a commitment to accept the tokenomics that Dfinity had the right to design in the best interest of the project.  I just don't agree with the idea that neurons need to be transferrable in a free market when they were not designed for that purpose.

I've seen that a "Merge Maturity" button was included. I'm really astonished and happy about this. This helps to fix an underlying problem. 

As you've written:

I’m in favor of equality for both accumulation and liquidity, so I would advocate for a fixed threshold maturity to Spawn Neuron instead of the 1 ICP threshold.

The merge maturity button helps to provide equality for accumulation now. I hope the liquidity aspect will also be fixed soon, via your approach.

hi all, i recently lost some funds using the NNS wallet app. (see https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-disburse-changes-account-address-randomly-nns-doesnt-validate-account-lost-icp/7024/3)

Apparently we are able to transfer funds to invalid account addresses: so i'd like to propose for consideration that the NNS (a) return any funds which are sent to invalid addresses (b) enforce checksum on accounts for transfers of ICP so that in the future ICP cannot be sent to account addresses which don't actually exist.

thanks

i don't like this proposal it adds another layer of complexity to spawning which just isnt necessary.  we already have enough to deal with and the 1 icp threshold is easy and simple to understand.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-09-08 13:53:45 UTC | #75

i don't see this as a problem.  someone's invested more in this system and they get an advantage. 

whales also have the issue that they cannot sell all of their coins immediately or have to find otc buyers, as well as invest in better security and systems for evaluating proposals.  so if you want to get into "equivalency" there are may facets of the prism to see reality from besides when a neuron reaches that magical 1 icp.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-09-08 13:51:05 UTC | #76

I don't see any value to the network in being able to transfer neurons.  I see a big security risk for myself and other neuron holders. Also it will create a sort of "votes for sale" situation that will misalign incentives for long term growth that the network benefits from long term staking when some people will decide to sell their neurons or some rental market comes into play where basically it becomes cheaper to attack the system. 

anyway if neurons can be transferred then we might as well get rid of staking because what's the point then. as no one will have anything at stake since they can sell immediately.

MichaelAnnh | 2021-09-09 13:20:20 UTC | #77

@superduper

> i don’t see this as a problem. someone’s invested more in this system and they get an advantage.

So you want someone with more money to have an exponential advantage? Where does your assumption come that 10% invested of 2 people with different net worth should lead to an advantage for the one with the higher stake?


Large holders have to find Otc buyers for their 100ks of ICP.... That's indeed such a problem if you have net worth of millions of dollars and you have to knock on the door of an exchange. Indeed, I'm so glad that I'm not a millionair and won't have to deal with such things.  ***Sarcasm off**

The only reasonable argument is the security aspect, if you have a higher stake. So large holders want to get something extra for having to deal with higher security for their stake? Is this your main concern? Just to add a few points to this aspect: 

1. If yes, it should be discussed and not be hidden behind the shadow of unclear tokenomics. 
2.  The exponential function is hard to handle. As I've provided in multiple comments, the advantage of this would multiply over time to such an extent, that a large holder could probably buy up a whole country just to secure his stake. 
3.  IMO the protocol should aim for as much decentralization as possible. Since that can only happen over governance, it should mean that neurons/votes/holdings should be distributed over time. Additional incentives to prefer larger holdings are a bit contrary to this. @lastmjs made a great podcast about this.
4. Large holders have already got a big advantage they always seem to forget: Their large holding. Someone with a large holding can live from the staking reward atm. Spending a few ICP on additional security seems to be a fair trade for beeing able to practically not work and earn as much as a few middle class workers a month. 
5. Comparison to other projects: Eth PoS doesn't give you more just because you have a high stake. Also not Polkadot, or Cardano. So why do we want to go a complete other way here again? 


At least we got rid of this with the merge maturity button now, so the only discussion point is the liquidity aspect. One of my arguments:

> If there is serious market action, high stakes have got a liquidity advantage, which small guys don’t have.
E.g.: ICP rises to 300$ => 1kICP probably gets 1-2 ICP a week. At 300$ that would suddenly be 300$ to 600$ on liquidity in a week. The high stake holder can dump it, the small guy (10ICP) can’t (even if it would only be a fraction; we speak about 0.01 to 0.02 ICP a week =>@300$ : 3$ to 6$).
It’s the simple fact that the high stake holder can (and will) use it to realise profit and engage in the market, while the small fish can’t.

If you want to say that this is justified because of greater expenses for security, then I'd like to have some calculations/facts and discussions about this. 

What is an acceptable amount of money for something like that? Is the 1ICP treshold liquidity advantage good for this? Should we make another incentive? E.g. Dfinity treasury wallet pays for this directly, instead taxing the small holders indirectly via the liquidity over the 1ICP treshold? What do others say to the presented points above? 

Why do other projects don't have this kind of arguments/problems? 
Of course they have other approaches via stake pools and nominated proof of stake, however they are not so different. The stake pool operators collect a certain amount of fee of the people, who are delegating to them. 
=> If that is translated, it would mean that the neurons we're following should collect fees. If someone with a high stake wants to collect additional income, he should advertise his neuron and make others follow him. Would that be an approach suitable for Dfinity? 
Via this he could earn without giving others a liquidity disadvantage, he could pay for additional security, and it would lead to more decentralization of the IC, since direct participation in governance becomes rewarded more. Of course he'd also have to work for his earned ICP, that's what I see as an absolute win for all. 
**Work more => earn more** instead of **have more => earn more** 


____________
@superduper
My main concern in the neuron discussion is that the free market will find it's paths anyway. Surpressing free market processes over the long term, only destabilizes the system. Actually we could both sell our votes atm. It doesn't make sense but we could. You could call out a price and I could answer. Buying votes without transfering ICP or neurons. It's possible. 

I hope there will be a Townhall soon for all this kind of discussions.

I agree on this and would be interested in the Foundations reasoning behind setting the threshhold to 1 ICP instead of a certain maturity as communicated @diegop

> The maturity of a neuron starts at 0 but increases with voting activity. When a neuron’s maturity grows beyond a certain threshold, then it can spawn a new neuron containing newly minted ICP, which resets its own maturity back to zero.

[source: https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8]

Another thing I would like to suggest is the option to lock a neuron in "merge maturity mode". This would automatically merge the maturity (maybe once a day) and not allow neuron owners to spawn any neurons to retrieve their voting rewards. The lock-up mechanism would be exactly the same as it already is and users would benefit from an additional bonus, just like the age bonus.

For anyone who is interested in discussing these topics face to face, we're having a Town Hall video call meeting to discuss these governance/tokenomics topics this Friday at 5PM UTC in the DFINITY Devs Discord: https://discord.gg/m3x86APHyX

I know it is short notice, the first time is tricky. But if it goes well and seems useful we can iterate on the process and hold these meetings on a regular basis or ad hoc whenever is necessary.

I hope to see you there.

"most of the ICP minted is from staking not node providers", for now*. We only have ~250 node machines right now. Should be 100x at least to really start flexing off the computational capabilities. And to have any global impact, it should eventually have 1M+ machines. Otherwise the computational fire power is just way to low to host global apps.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-09 21:19:07 UTC | #82

Nice thing is that node provider capacity can scale with IC computational demand, which itself drives token price - meaning that each ICP would go further in paying node providers, when there's a need to bring more node providers on to the network.

So simplistically, if IC canister demands grow 2x, suppose we need 2x more subnets (if already at capacity); this costs 2x as much to pay the new nodes on those new subnets.

But it’s reasonable to assume that ICP price grows roughly 2x in the same period (at least - probably more if you buy into Metcalfe’s Law), and so still the same amount of ICP must be minted to pay node providers (who get paid a relatively constant fiat amount, even if remitted in ICP). So roughly the same proportion (or even a falling proportion) of minted ICP should go to node providers vs. stakers over time, by this logic.

How about a fork? Looks like part of the community is starting a new project that is a fork of icp called
 icpreboot

LightningLad91 | 2021-09-09 23:46:42 UTC | #84

Fwiw, I agree with your proposal to set a threshold based on neuron maturity, if that’s possible.

It might be helpful if @diegop could provide the team’s rationale for setting it to 1 ICP in the first place.

I agree with being able to transfer neurons, but not instantaneously. I think users should have to express their intent to transfer their neuron by initiating a countdown (weeks or months). During this countdown the  neuron should no longer be allowed to vote. once the timer runs out the user should be able to set up a contract whereby another user can deposit a specified amount of ICP. If the correct amount is deposited the neuron ownership will be transferred and the transfer delay immediately reset.

Just my two cents on the matter

-------------------------

integral_wizard | 2021-09-10 08:55:44 UTC | #85

I agree in general. But the demand elasticity is much greater than our capabilities to scale up the fleet size. The IC computational demand is already greater than what we have. Even a single problematic data center right now can slow down a whole region. Looking at the pace of II anchor growth (exponential), canister growth (exponential) and node fleet size (linear, or on pause?), what is obvious is that the computational capability does not grow as fast as everything else. We talk about "boundless scalability" and that is a great achievement on the software side but what it eventually comes down to is the computational capacity, which has problems. The interest is there, I'm waiting in the queue myself, but there is no visibility and seemingly nothing is happening. I'm sure a lot of work is happening behind the scenes though.

Social recovery might be the solution to this: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html

We just finished up our first community governance meeting, what I've been calling a Town Hall meeting.

Here's my summary of the most important conclusions and action items. Hopefully others in attendance will share their take-aways if beneficial:

1. Neuron transfers seems a contentious topic: should we try to restrict them completely, put in some restrictions, or open transfers completely? Seems like we need a lot of deep thoughts and persuasions on this topic
2. How will the inflation/deflation of the IC play out over the long term? I think we need someone to do a deep dive and create models mapping out various plausible scenarios. We want to make sure inflation will be in check at future theoretical levels of usage. The relationship between cycle burning and node operator reward inflation seems most important to understanding deflationary pressures...or perhaps just cycle burning. We need to know what amount of burn we can expect in the future. Charts and graphs please, if someone is looking for something beneficial to do this is an open opportunity.

I see neuron sales/transfers kinda working like life insurance policies or annuities sales…where you would have to take a hit or get paid out cents on the dollar to cash out early but it could become an interesting market on an exchange.  Unique compared to other tokens.  

Example:  a neuron with 100 ICP with an 8 year delay.

Why would someone sell?  They need emergency liquidity maybe…

Would you pay market price for that?  Of course not because you could just do that on a normal exchange.  So you would buy at a discount and your return would be the market price after dissolve.

I don’t see the vote buying argument.  If you wanted to buy votes go buy up tons of ICP on an exchange and stake but you could get votes at a discount but only if people are willing to sell at a loss.

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-09-11 23:00:16 UTC | #89

Here's one concern I have. If neurons are transferable, in a market downturn many neuron holders would sell their neurons--almost certainly at a discount to the price of the ICP in the neuron. Anyone who wanted to buy ICP to stake in a neuron would almost certainly buy neurons on the secondary market instead of ICP. If long-term investors are all buying neurons instead of ICP in the downturn, the price of ICP could absolutely crater due to the severe supply/demand imbalance.

-------------------------

namyIC | 2021-09-12 13:34:29 UTC | #90

I am strongly against a secondary market for neurons. No one would be able to anticipate how an actor with hostile takeover intentions could social engineer people into selling their neurons or how the holder would dump the neuron price on such a market in a stressed market scenario. Preferably, introduce an unwinding mechanism where the neuron holder pays a non-linear (based on time to maturity, dissolve time, etc) termination fee in ICP (a % of the ICP locked in the neuron) that goes straight to Dfinity or distributed pro rata to all neuron holders as locked ICP in their configured neurons. Dissolve/unwind the neuron and the remaining ICP after termination fee goes back to the holder which then can be sold on the market.

@lastmjs 
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tokenomics-proposal-community-consideration/6159/86

If I follow this thread of @Alixthe and @wpb I've got a few questions on what is discussed there: 


Are you talking about simple multisig or much more social recovery? 
If you're talking about social recovery in terms of neuron ownership/transfer you should really be aware that this is an absolute sensitive matter IMO. @Alixthe wrote: 

>  Also, perhaps the Master II could be pre-configured for certain eventualities for example in the event of a death (which needs to be verified by say the beneficiary)

Where does social recovery start and where does it stop? The further it is pushed, the more it gets into the direction of **KYC**. I think everyone sees this 3 fat marked letters now, and knows how sensitive this could get. As it is formulated above, you put yourself into an oracle problem, which further relies on trusted 3rd parties. The beneficiary can act fraudulant as well, that's where 3rd parties would come into play. And in the end you've suddenly got a neuron which is only transferable if a certain lawyer (completely different from country to country) agrees to this. This wouldn't go well in cryptoland (see Davos FUD). 

If it is only much more an addition/tool for someone it could be a whole different story. The 2 following statements are completely different: 

"You'll get an additional tool, where you can set up social recovery, if you want it." 
"You'll only be able to transfer a neuron if you set up social recovery." 

One statement might give freedom, the other one might take it.

Your mechanism is interesting. I'm quite on your side with this. However this would already go deeper into implementation. 
I think there are still many points which have to be resolved if I read the latest posts. You've also written:

You're approach is great the more I think about it. Maybe it's a correct balance between complete liberal free neuron trading vs restriction and shadow market. 
This could be enough to counter liquidity arguments: Paying a  fee to unlock early is fair, otherwise I'd have to chose a shadow p2p market and trust on some unknown party. If I really need to liquidate I could, and ICP wouldn't restricit it. With a fee there could be enough motivation not to do it. However it might become a political tool in the future (one governance vote makes restrictions much harder and the other one makes them loose). Since we all have governance rights that wouldn't be such a problem (hopefully with enough decentralization).

@BenTaylor
I see your concern, but IMO that would lead to a healing effect. I've written something before which addresses your concern. 


https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tokenomics-proposal-community-consideration/6159/67?u=michaelannh

The main question we should ask ourselves is: Are we afraid to make some sincere postive longterm changes in tokenomics, because it might have a negative impact on the price over the short term?

No one should ever invest money that one can’t afford to loose in the first place. However, with that said, I completely understand that one’s life situation can go from better to worse quite fast and therefore it would be beneficial to unwind the locked neuron(s) in that case in case of the need of emergency funds. But in order to do so it must come to a cost and I believe it is best if that cost come to such a price that it should be close to ones last resort of options. This is the governance of the whole network and if one decides to unwind the cost of ones decision of doing so should benefit the rest of the neuron holders in the network why I am leaning more towards a pro rata distribution model of the fee paid for unwinding. We have a perfectly capable primary market where ICP is traded, creating one for neurons would most likely make this one very illiquid as well on top of the other concerns I mentioned earlier. Just my 2 cents!

coteclaude | 2021-09-12 20:46:21 UTC | #93

It is clear to me that the actual design (by Dominic and Dfinity team) was done with a long term vision rewarding more investors ready to lock their investment on long term.  The longer, the better reward.  it make so much sense.  Obviously, I see that some people would want to have the best long term reward, while being able to sell their neuron quickly.  At then end, 100% would go to neurons, the rewards would go down for everyone and the ICP price would also being kept low as the entire supply would be available for sell somehow.  Just make absolutely no sense to me and this is not what I have signed up for.  It is a hard decision to lock for 1 year and have your investment available in a quiet short period compare to 8 years but if you have any doubt, go for the 1 year.  But we have to do it and live with it.  
On another related but different subject, we should first vote on how many % of votes should be needed to pass some of the proposals. Not all proposals weight the same.  A change proposal that affect others financials should certainly need a 80% or 90% approvals for passing.  I don't understand why or where it comes from that a 50+1 adoption level was adopted for a fit for all proposals.

Very interesting @lastmjs and thanks for the information ~ just read Vitalik's article with one of his key takeaways summarised below:

"*To me, the goal of crypto was never to remove the need for *all* trust. **Rather, the goal of crypto is to give people access to cryptographic and economic building blocks that give people more *choice* in whom to trust, and furthermore allow people to build more *constrained* forms of trust** : giving someone the power to do some things on your behalf without giving them the power to do everything. Viewed in this way, **multisig and social recovery are a perfect expression of this principle** : each participant has *some* influence over the ability to accept or reject transactions, but no one can move funds unilaterally.*"

Alixthe | 2021-09-13 00:08:45 UTC | #95

Hello @Michaelannh ~ thanks for tagging me. Surprised that a simple post can generate so much interest. The beauty of this is right or wrong, ideas are being put forward as there is so much to learn from others. 

For me, I am just a layperson throwing out ideas for discussion as I am neither a crypto tokenomics expert nor someone who professes to be and you for one are obviously a learned and well researched person in this field based on your highly analytical and well thought-out posts.

I have not been keeping pace with all the comments here on this forum but have read snippets here and there.  With so much interest generated and comments received (93 posts and counting), we should probably start thinking of summarising what has been discussed as follows:

1. Without over-thinking, what is the number 1 problem (if any) in ICP's tokenomics that needs to be solved right now? 

2. If this problem has been identified, what are the proposed solution(s) (extra points for proposed solutions from qualified and experienced crypto tokenomics experts) that the community can come up with?

3. From all the proposed solutions received, what are the pros and cons in implementing each of the proposed solutions together with supporting evidence / calculations / research backing up these proposals?

4. Put the best proposal to be voted-upon by the community.

5. Repeat step 1. 

A summary of the above should be pinned to this main post for the benefit of others who have not kept up with all the posts here (apologies if I am somehow reiterating what @lastmjs may have mentioned previously but I guess this should be high on the agenda).

On a side note, I have also noticed a few posts about issues with transferring of neurons. Not sure if this is the same but Harrison Hines mentioned in his recent community conversation that "neurons as NFTs" was on Fleek's roadmap as per the following link:
https://youtu.be/1Fewxn4ZN-0?t=3040

Wonder how this is going to play out.

Thanks.

I highly agree with the eventual importance of having different vote threshold levels for different types of proposals.

ayjayem | 2021-09-13 19:13:48 UTC | #97

Another challenge with neuron transfer: wouldn't this very much complicate liquid democracy?

Once neurons start following a broader variety of other neurons, wouldn't neuron transfer make it much more of a challenge to ensure that you're still following who you want to, given that the neuron you're following may at any arbitrary time be sold to another principal? Many of the guarantees of liquid democracy would seem to break down.

This could also very much compound the security risks here.

Malicious actors technically need only a significant proportion of the *liquid voting power on the IC* at a given moment to determine NNS outcomes. Some neurons can have small ICP stakes, but a ton of voting power from followers and their followers. So it could be relatively very cheap to buy at-least-momentary control of the IC if neurons can be transferred - nothing remotely close to the cost of "50% of the ICP + 1 vote," as is more commonly discussed.

Unless these challenges can be addressed, supporting neuron transfer looks prohibitively risky.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-09-13 15:22:57 UTC | #98

I love this. Personally, I am somewhat confident that I could create a small group of 3-5 people that would be one of the most unbreakable networks ever to exist, considering how strong my trust is in them. I would trust them with my funds, if not my life. I hope many of us have people like this in our lives.

-------------------------

ayjayem | 2021-09-15 04:56:49 UTC | #99

I think these are really good points.

If neurons can be sold, neurons basically just become speculative ICP futures (with certain optionality attached, and bonus-adjusted for dissolve delay and age bonuses). The incentives for ICP holders to steward the IC's development for its long-term success mostly evaporate.

Combined with the fact that liquid democracy could become unworkable with neuron transfer (per [post above](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/tokenomics-proposal-community-consideration/6159/97)), how would governance on the IC function anymore?

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-09-13 18:51:50 UTC | #100

so in a free market parties can decide on rules and boundaries.  a free market isn't willy nilly anything goes as participants are free to make rules and come to agreement among participants; you are free to not participate and create your own market with no rules at all and see if anyone wants to be a part of it as well.  the rules of the dfinity market are such that people who funded this project and gave it money knew that it would be a staking type system, and in general staking type systems involve locking up coins which generally entails not being able to sell that account. given that no one was forced to give the foundation money it seems obvious to me that the free market of people who gave money went along with this idea. 

i don't know how many have set their dissolve delay to 8 years now but those who have basically have consented to the current arrangement. you can talk about free market all you want but you must recognize that in a free market actors are free to collude and agree on rules/contracts

regarding the minimums have you considered the "nothing at stake issue" this is a major issue and well i do not know the internal functions of the dfinity system i can tell you that perhaps you should consider the idea that another reason the minimum exists as such is because of scaling issues around the ledger that need to be worked on.  so the solution isn't let's make it harder for investors but lets make the system function better to provide more access. and to your point about decentralization if we were to move to a % based system it would mean that less new coins are available to be sold to the market thus thwarting the ability of new stakers to come on board.

and btw the minimum on Eth is 32 Eth, which is quite a lot, and so yes you actually get more for having a high stake vs having only 16 eth and needing to participate in a pool. By  comparison waiting for 1 ICP ($55) to be generated on a daily basis given that the current yield is about 25%+  (if locked for a long time) requires about 1470 ICP which currently has a market value of $81k, whereas 32 Eth is over 100k; so i'm not sure how you can claim that the other systems somehow offer something better to the small investor.

finally as far as payments for following as you say they should collect fees but they can also choose not to collect fees (remember that free market!). an entity that wants more votes would obviously have lower fees or even no fees. in the case of dfinity foundation most of the important proposals come from it at this point and it has a sizable war chest so one can imagine that they value having more followers and voting power at this point rather than charging some fee.

your concerns are well places but I think in the case of the 1 icp minimum you are attributing to some sort of poor design decision to what is more easily explained by technical scaling issues that in the future may improve.  and with regard to neurons you have to acknowledge that while it's true that someone locked into an 8 year dissolve may sell their vote it would be highly irrational for them to sell their vote for a change that would have a negative impact 8 years down the line, whereas if he were free to sell his neuron whole the system losses the extra protection of participants who must without doubt consider what are the long term consequences of their actions.

[quote="superduper, post:100, topic:6159"]

[/quote]

You're right. That's what the whole discussion is about at the moment.
I'd personally like looser conditions at many points. Others don't. So we agree on frameworks and the majority (Dfinity) decides. If I think that some points aren't worth the risk, I could just move to another crypto project. 
And that's the point: I've provided so many written lines in here, which show how other projects are governed, and what Dfinity/we as a community could learn from them to improve our tokenomics. 
Another of your lines:

[quote="superduper, post:100, topic:6159"]

[/quote]

No, staking type projects don't require locking up tokens in general. See Cardano for an example. Others have less restricitve rules. One of them is Polkadot (28d unlocking period). Yes, stakers agree to the terms and conditions Dfinity sets, but my point is that others have far better conditions (IMO). You can neglect that fact but in the end, competitors don't sleep and that's exactly where pressure starts. Why should someone stake for Dfinity if he has far better conditions somewhere else? For the tech?

To which extent does that compensate better conditions? If you want to sell leasing contracts for a Lamborghini, and prevent people to get out of it, that's ok, but that's not my approach. Before doing so, I'd ask people why they need a Lamborghini and if it is a good investment? If they can't say anything I'd ask them if they really needed a leasing contract and if they could just buy a cheaper car instead. They could also pay a few hundred bucks to drive a Lambo on a race track for an hour if they really needed it for their pleasure. Now translate that to ICP vs Eth/Ada/Dot. 

Furthermore you're already able to sell your Neurons via the shadow market. So that argument is also not valid atm (see discussion above): 


[quote="MichaelAnnh, post:58, topic:6159"]
think the free market puts pressure on this from another side. p2p and otc deals. Let’s take a look at this [reddit post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ICPTrader/comments/pd7519/locked_icp/).
They talk about selling locked ICP with -50% on spot. People could start to sell Yubikeys/ accounts (secure if the seed is deleted from identity managment /if device is changed) via p2p and otc trades. People might start a huge shadow market for neurons/accounts, without anyone knowing about the actual distribution numbers.
[/quote]


And now to your next point: 

[quote="superduper, post:100, topic:6159"]
and to your point about decentralization if we were to move to a % based system it would mean that less new coins are available to be sold to the market thus thwarting the ability of new stakers to come on board.
[/quote]

I've already made some points in another comment: 

[quote="MichaelAnnh, post:58, topic:6159"]
If there is concern that the liquidity of ICP by holders (especially big pockets) is decreased, we’re at the perfect track. => If someone fears that his advantage isn’t here anymore, there might be something we got right. Now we get to a point where the minimum 6month lock-up period could really hurt.
Assets staked for that amount of time and not getting any liquid ICP that fast because of the 2.5% minimum maturity => That might be too much and it’s rather a punishment than an award.
Here comes **point 5** into play again.

Your next statement:

[quote="superduper, post:100, topic:6159"]

As you can see there is a huge gap. Either you're in long term (8 years) or you are more on the "I stake for 1-3 years and look on how the project has developed by then. Maybe I'll stake longer, if I like what I see." Long term could be people with high interest in the projetct/or long-term commitment (Developer/Dfinity wallets themselves)
That's what the free market tells me.

Actually exchanges offer staking services. You don't need 16 Eth there...
However you've got a valid point, if you throw in eth/dot vs icp. Their capital requirements in minimum stake benefits large holders (32 eth/40dot). At Polkadot they've decreased (~200Dot to 40Dot), however if the price rises it gets countered again. In the end it's a problem and they've to work on that. 
As you've pointed out, they might benefit large holders there, and ICP benefits them with the 1ICP treshold. 
However we should ask ourselves if both systems have their flaws and if there are others which are a bit better? Cardano doesn't have requirements like that, as far as I know. I also think that Eth will bring down the 32 Eth after the merge. Dot is also decreasing it. => They improve their tokenomics. 

We could just play it down and watch them pass ICP. Not my choice. 

[quote="superduper, post:100, topic:6159"]

[/quote]

I get your concern. You're basically saying that price dumping in voting fees might counteract the decentralication which was initially intended. So it might become a tool which adds to unfairness like the 1ICP treshold.

Just a few thoughts: 

Why do you assume everyone would follow Dfinity it they had alternatives? Of course most devs and Dfinity are practically in one boat, but in spite of that, I'd prefer voting for a dev directly. 
Let's take @lastmjs for an example. I listened to his podcasts, read his stuff on Twitter, etc...
If he'd set up a voting neuron and he'd take 5% from followees , I'd do it, because I'd know that he'd vote in my interest (since I agree to his views). Would you vote for a party/politician you don't agree with, just because they offer you more (I don't want to say that I don't agree with Dfinity)? 

I know many people in this world do so, and that's a huge problem. Many vote for something in the short term without the long-term view. Do voting fees contribute to this misbehaviour or not? Let's draw a scenario:  Party A collects fees, has a high amount of followers and starts fee dumping so its follower get more. More followers will add their votes to A: A gains more and more power and suddenly makes a vote which is absolutely harmful for everyone. Maybe they don't get it in the short term but suddenly ICP turns into something we know from 1930-1945. 
IMO fees are not the problem if we fear centralization. Fees are only an instrument for bad actors to help them fullfill their wishes. Fees wouldn't contribute to that as long as: 

- Huge stakes have got sincere interest in decentralization, doing the right thing **and**
- Actors don't purely put their votes into something out of short term capitalistic interest

If both points are invalid, we've got a problem. We've got 2 security levels.

your concerns are well places but I think in the case of the 1 icp minimum you are attributing to some sort of poor design decision to what is more easily explained by technical scaling issues that in the future may improve.

IMO the liquidity inequality via the 1ICP treshold can add much more to centralization than price dumping of a voting fee. Scenario here: 

Party A (huge stake) waits for a sudden price increase and liquidates the huge stack, generated via the 1 ICP treshold. 
The market dumps and party A buys back the liquidated ICP for a cheaper price. Stakers with a low stake can't do anything in the meantime. They can't interact with the market and counter A's effort to centralize. Repeat this steps a few times and suddenly you've got an instance with absolute power, without ever relying on other voters. **You've only got 1 security level:** 

- Party A has got sincere interest in decentralization

If we'd like to further introduce additional mechanisms for decentralization Dfinity could also integrate a minimum fee on voting neurons to avoid price dumping on voting fees. This would benefit lower neurons thus lead to more decentralization. **Now you've got 3 security levels instead of one.** 
=> Big player could shut down the minium fee via a vote (they'd require a majority for this). Afterwards the majority of capitalistic players would have to vote for him. And in the 3rd step his malicious interest has to take over. However price dumping in voting fees isn't even necessary to gain the majority in power. You could even do that without it. As you see the voting fee could be a governance tool. If centralization is too much you could incentivize voting for small neurons via adjusting the fee (maybe Gaussian distribution?).

and with regard to neurons you have to acknowledge that while it’s true that someone locked into an 8 year dissolve may sell their vote it would be highly irrational for them to sell their vote for a change that would have a negative impact 8 years down the line, whereas if he were free to sell his neuron whole the system losses the extra protection of participants who must without doubt consider what are the long term consequences of their actions.

I sincerely think that the community should start to make a load of scenarios on what might actually happen.
