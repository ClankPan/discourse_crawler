I just want to say i think this is a really great back and forth you have going. As someone who is observing the conversation I do take issue with a couple of your points:

[quote="MichaelAnnh, post:101, topic:6159"]
And that’s the point: I’ve provided so many written lines in here, which show how other projects are governed, and what Dfinity/we as a community could learn from them to improve our tokenomics.
[/quote]

1. Why do you think we should try to learn anything from the tokenomic models of ADA/ETH/DOT? Is it because they've been around longer? Or are you saying their % staked is higher an therefore they are a better model to follow? Proof-of-Stake networks are still very new and I don't think we can consider these models to be proven effective just because they seem appealing today.

[quote="MichaelAnnh, post:101, topic:6159"]
and that there is nearly no one staking for 5,6,7y?
[/quote]

That is definitely an interesting point. However, there is a growing number of people staking ICP for 8 years. Most of which aren't dissolving. I don't have a reference now but I will find one later and update. What this tells me is that we might consider changing the max lock-up to something like 3-4 years. To me the extra 4 years seems more irritating than beneficial. Would be great if @diegop could get someone from Dfinity to comment on why 8 was chosen.

[quote="MichaelAnnh, post:101, topic:6159"]
I sincerely think that the community should start to make a load of scenarios on what might actually happen.
[/quote]

I know we have talked about this topic quite a bit in the ICP Maximalist telegram channel. If you're interested in taking part in a (respectful) discussion you are more than welcome to join the conversation. See @icpmaximalist on Twitter for telegram link.

Fair question. I actually don't know their percentage numbers. If it comes to that eth is actually still pretty bad (~7 Mio Eth on ~116 Mio Eth in circulation). Lock up till after the merge (unknown) and already down at 5% annual return. Quite some risk for that return.
Cardano leads the statistics here I think. I'd have to research what the percentage staked is at the moment.

You're absolutely right with the argument. Other approaches are still young and no one knows which one is the best atm. That's why I try to give an overview and ask questions. Time will show which one has got the better tokenomics/governance. However if I compare some of them with ICP and watch the main arguments on why ICP is governed that way, I'll always get the same impression: 

We are far more concerned about a 51% attack than any PoS competitior. Much of our governance/tokenomics is founded on that. 6month lock up, discussion about neurons, etc. 

And that's my main point: I can't predict the future, but this discrepancy is concerning me. If I look at Polkadot and Gavin Wood I'd be really cautious if I'd claim they'll fail because they don't have a 6month lock-up. They have good developers and tech as well.
So why do they think this can be done with 28day lock-up and we think we need 6 months lock-up? 
Or why does Cardano think they don't need a lock-up at all? By the way, all mentioned projects have got a higher market cap than ICP atm. So their holders have got far more to lose than we have, and yet we're far more concerned about a 51% attack than they're. **Why?** 

Either they'll fail miserably with their approach and ICP is right with the lock-up to ensure long-term governance, or in the end they'll succeed and pressure on ICP will increase steadily. 

I really don't have answers to that, and no one has given me a satisfying one yet. Is it only because we are far more cautious? However if we bring in that argument I could also counter it again with centralization arguments: The longer ICP/Dfinity stays too cautious/restrictive/protective and fears giving up governance rights, the less likely its decentralization will become. Who takes part in the governance if it stays too protective? This could be a huge side effect.

And that's why I think we should learn from other projects, or at least have a discussion about their approaches vs ICP approach.

Hey @MichaelAnnh @LightningLad91

I definitely would not want to change the max dissolve delay to make it shorter.

The max neuron dissolve delay of 8 years is important because it discourages unlocking the neuron.  It is more attractive to leave the neuron locked with an 8 year dissolve delay and liquidate ICP rewards indefinitely than it is to unlock a neuron with an 8 year dissolve delay so you can liquidate the total ICP in 8 years.  Longer dissolve delays makes long term governance more attractive.  

The long dissolve delay also creates deflationary pressure for ICP.  Eventually we will see somewhere around 90% staking in 8 year neurons, which I predict people will chose not to reverse.  Decentralization will occur because eventually it will make more sense for individuals to liquidate rewards than compound rewards.

-------------------------

[quote="wpb, post:105, topic:6159"]

[/quote]

Is it really the number 8 that discourages unlocking the neuron or the promise of max rewards that discourages this?

[/quote]

I agree we need a long term dissolve delay for max rewards but what I think we're all trying to figure out is if 8 is really the right number. What is the major advantage of 8? 4 years seems like a significantly long enough period of time to feel the affects of any bad voting history so why do we push it out to 8? Perhaps there is a reason for the 8 year lock-up but that isn't apparent to me.

If we want to promote more long term staking I think reducing the max delay might help. Some people may want max rewards but aren't willing to bite the bullet for 8 years. I think this is reflected by the lack of neurons being locked up for 4, 5,6,7 years. We could also make the argument that lowering the range from 8 years to 4 years would increase the rewards for smaller lock-ups, promoting even more staking. I want to reach the 90% staked goal as well but I don't think we need to shoot for all neurons being locked for max delay. I think we should promote any level of commitment from 6mos+ and if the 4,5,6,7 year range is wasting away then why not re-work the system so everyone benefits? 

This all really just comes down to why 8 years? Why was that number chosen. I really hope someone from Dfinity can chime in and provide this context for our consideration.

Thank you for providing this perspective. I agree that we should continue to monitor the situation and adjust accordingly. I'm just not convinced we've given it enough time to determine if a drastically smaller lockup (< 6 Mos.) is warranted. I do think we should try to address the large gap in staking between 3 years and 8 years. 

The great news is that the flexibility of the NNS allows us to make these changes when needed.

-------------------------

mac | 2021-09-30 21:56:46 UTC | #108

Do we have any good responses from Dfinity on this? Why can't we transfer ownership of a locked neuron from one address to another address? Here are scenarios I can brainstorm where this functionality is critical:

1. Your original address is compromised so you need to generate a new identity and move your existing neurons to your newly created and secure address. This seems necessary from a security standpoint.

2. You want to have a third party manage the handling of your neurons, how can you transfer full custody to the third parties?

3. What if you want to sell a locked neuron? You need to be able to transfer the locked neuron to a buyer controlled address.

Does Dfinity have any plan to implement this feature on the roadmap? We need to be able to transfer control of neurons, whether they are locked for 8 years or not.

@diegop

-------------------------

Ori | 2021-10-01 09:27:42 UTC | #109

Your third point is actually the reason transfer of neurons is not allowed, since a holder could vote against the interests of the network and then immediately sell, removing the risk of their stake losing value.

-------------------------

mac | 2021-10-01 21:55:39 UTC | #110

This hardly outweighs the need for security.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-10-13 03:12:06 UTC | #111

Hi mac,

On your first point, we recognize that there is a need to deal with compromised keys and to safeguard the neurons controlled by them. No concrete proposal has been made yet, but we are continuing to think about this and review alternatives. We're just not being hasty in rushing to a solution that could have other consequences.

On the second point, we are considering expanding the notion of a hot key to fuller set of privileges. This would allow, for example, granting permission to a neuron manager to spawn or merge maturity, without allowing the manager to start dissolving or disburse assets.

On the third point, such a proposal will likely never come from DFINITY, since it makes it possible for a disingenuous party to purchase a large number of locked neurons, use them to vote on a specific proposal, and then sell them. We want stakeholders to have a personal and enduring stake in what they vote for, since they incentivizing votes that have the best interest of the network in mind.

LightningLad91 | 2021-10-13 11:12:37 UTC | #112

Hi John. I would like to understand why Dfinity chose a max lock up of 8 years vs 4 or 5 years. Do you know of anyone that can explain that to us?

Sorry for the late notice, but tomorrow Friday October 29th at 5pm UTC we'll be having another governance video discussion here: https://discord.gg/m3x86APHyX

We will focus on what is arguably the most pressing and contentious governance and tokenomics topic, neuron transfers.

Please bring your thoughts to this discussion and collaborate to help address the concern.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-18 10:39:23 UTC | #115

We have started a new topic related to tokenomics that can be found here…

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters/8661

It is focused on a specific proposal to change the dissolve delay bonus and age bonus parameters of the tokenomics.  It is not intended to replace other valuable discussion on a wide variety of tokenomics ideas that can be found here.

kmanxhuka | 2021-11-25 23:30:25 UTC | #118

How about putting a voting ban on the sold neurons for an amount of time. Whenever someone buys a neuron, he can't cast votes for 1, 3 or 6 months. Also, set a cool down timer before you can sell a neuron, for example, I have to stop my neuron from voting for a month or two, and after that, I can sell it. Then, when someone buys it, he also can't vote with that neuron unless the new cool down time has passed (1,3, 6 months). 
This could discourage malicious parties to cast votes which could harm the network because they couldn't sell their neurons until the cool down has passed.
Hope I was clear.

I thought people here would appreciate this new page. The dashboard team worked last few weeks to make sure it is a helpful piece of info for the community in making decisions for voting, etc… Feedback is always welcomed.

Extra node cost (1 time cost) 0per month
Extra average node cost (1 time cost) per month, per node.
etc...

I appreciate the feedback (please, keep it coming), I do not want to discourage you. Though I should note that adding most of that is the current intent.

Sidenote: most obvious thing you will see from circulation... NNS rewards *dwarf* node provider minting/costs, so the dashboard team spent more time to make sure that part of the dashboard and APIs were solid.

This is great Diego, thanks to you and the team!

Could you explain what "undisbursed" rewards are? Are these voting rewards that were locked up in neurons or is this ICP that is just sitting in a fully dissolved neuron?

[quote="LightningLad91, post:125, topic:6159"]

[/quote]

I believe are NNS rewards which have are either sitting on the neuron or unrealized % maturity that’s don’t exist as actual ICP yet.

@Dylan did I get that right?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-09 20:44:17 UTC | #127

Undisbursed rewards exist as maturity only, and have not yet been "minted" by either spawning the rewards into a new neuron, or merging that maturity back into the stake of the neuron that accrued the maturity. Put another way, undisbursed rewards have not yet increased supply, since that only happens when rewards are minted by one of the above two means.

Do you know if this % return assumes continuous compounding or annual? I know it says annualized but I just want to confirm:

Thanks john! Really appreciate it

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-12-09 23:44:52 UTC | #131

@jwiegley explained it perfectly.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-12-09 23:50:15 UTC | #132

No, there is no compounding. The calculation takes the "trailing 24-hour" return (i.e., based on the most recent daily *reward event*) for a "neuron with an age of zero" and multiplies that by the number of days in a year to calculate an "annualized return".

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-09 23:50:56 UTC | #133

The 28.4% is the uncompounded return, but it assumes that a lot of factors hold constant and really only applies (and even then, just approximately) to the first year.

-------------------------

cnr | 2021-12-09 23:51:26 UTC | #134

Great. So if I'm hitting "merge maturity" every day, I should in theory be earning more than 28.4% annually?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-09 23:57:27 UTC | #135

That's correct, you should earn a little bit more in that case, my own modeling suggests around 31%.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-12-10 00:01:47 UTC | #136

Just note that if more people start to stake ICP and total voting power goes up as a result, then your slice of the rewards pie will become smaller and your returns will go down. Hence the disclaimer under the slider. Over the past few months, the estimated annualized return for an 8-year dissolve delay hasn't gone down by much, but it's always possible that it will go down.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-10 00:03:23 UTC | #137

Yes, exactly what @Dylan said; in fact, competing stakeholders is the largest factor in return, so the more popular it becomes to do so, the smaller APYs will get.

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-12-10 00:16:28 UTC | #138

Supply and demand. Supply and demand.

-------------------------

cnr | 2021-12-10 19:27:03 UTC | #139

Right, the benefit of people staking is that tradable supply drops. So we should expect a rough inverse relationship between returns from interest and returns from the token value. 

As interest rates go down, token value should increase since when they're staked they can't be traded.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-10 19:30:18 UTC | #140

In this respect it's very similar to bonds: A bond offers high rates of interest when prices are low, to attract investors; but as people bid up the price of the bond, it's rate goes down, because it doesn't need to incentivize anymore.

-------------------------

cnr | 2021-12-10 19:45:18 UTC | #141

I'm curious to see how it will actually play out. Demand can still fluctuate wildly and, given that neuron staking funds are locked, it will leave supply relatively stable. 

E.g. if the market drops again, demand for icp might drop, but the total amount of staked icp will remain roughly the same (at most, ticking down total vote power at a rate of 1 second worth of voting power per account per second if everyone starts dissolving simultaneously. That's not real fast.) This is unlike a bond, which can be sold on the market at any time. 

Does this mean we should expect fewer flash crashes out of ICP?

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-13 03:22:37 UTC | #142

@diegop @jwiegley @Dylan 

Great job with the dashboard updates!  I really appreciate seeing the node provider, dispersed, and undispersed rewards displayed so clearly.  My hope is that the community will stop focusing so much on node provider rewards and start focusing more on inflation created by dissolving neurons as well as the unminted ICP that is sitting in neurons as earned maturity.  Those are, by far, more important to the inflation / deflation story than node provider rewards.  

I really hope the IC community will think more about how to incentivize staking because it would address the concerns about liquid ICP inflation much faster than burning ICP to pay for compute power.  The time lapse dissolve of neurons has an incredible deflationary effect, especially long dissolve delays, because it is irreversible except for the passage of time.  The #8yeargang has proven to be highly committed because over 97% of those neurons are not dissolving, which is almost almost equivalent to burning ICP.  Every time that dissolve delay slider moves up, it has a deflationary effect.  We spend too much time as a community thinking about ICP tokenomics in the same paradigms as other blockchains when the reality is that ICP tokenomics add completely new dynamics, especially the dissolve delay bonus and (potentially) the age bonus.

I know there are other features of the dashboard that are being worked on now, but one that I think would be helpful to the community is a breakdown of neurons by dissolve delay and dissolve status.  More specifically, it would be helpful to see that breakdown in terms of both total ICP and total voting power.  Taking this type of analytics a bit further, it would be very enlightening to easily see how this data changes over time.  Anyway, I'm sure you have some great new features in the works and I'm looking forward to seeing them as they roll out.  Once again, great job!

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-12-12 06:53:57 UTC | #143

I'm surprised there's so much "undisbursed" ICP sitting in neurons as maturity. They're literally useless there. Not liquid and no compounding. Do people just forget to do something with it? I know I do from time to time, but 73% of all rewards being "undisbursed" is quite high IMO.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-13 19:59:24 UTC | #144

Technically, reward maturity is liquid within 7 days, which is effectively liquid in my opinion.  It simply doesn’t exist yet (hasn’t been minted), which means it doesn’t count toward total available supply.  TBH, I’m not sure it is healthy overall for maturity to accumulate too much in neurons.  It’s probably something the IC community needs to start talking about.

edit: I originally made a comment about taxes that I am redacting since the proper answer is not known and tax professionals may conclude that taxes must be paid on voting reward maturity.  @dfisher @jwiegley thanks for asking the question and providing insight.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2021-12-12 08:28:56 UTC | #145

@wpb your post on taxes is is very insightful and something I hadn’t thought of. My tax accountants told me staking income has been deemed by the IRS to be income when it is received. But as you described, with maturity the tokens haven’t yet been minted so has the income event occurred yet? Two questions for you:  

1. Do you have professional tax advice from an accounting firm to corroborate your position that ICP staking income should only be recognized when the income becomes liquid and not just when maturity is accumulated?

2. Is this position even preferable? If there’s income tax to pay from staking and it’s just a question of when (during maturity accumulating or when it becomes liquid) wouldn’t you prefer to pay it sooner if you expect the price to go up over time? Sooner means a lower cost basis since we are all hoping the ICP price will be higher in 8 years from now than today. That’s precisely the reason folks do a 83(b) election…

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-13 20:02:44 UTC | #146

edit: Please read this comment with caution because I'm not a tax professional and may be completely wrong about tax implications.  I'm not deleting the comment simply because it does at least explain some of the mechanics behind what maturity represents and what happens when you spawn neuron or merge maturity.

Good questions.  I have not received professional tax advice and I’m not a tax advisor, so I am making an assumption that taxes don’t have to be paid on reward Maturity until the ICP rewards are minted by either Merge Maturity or Spawn Neuron events.  Maturity is just a way of accounting for how much ICP rewards you have earned, but it is not a payment or transaction.  It doesn’t seem logical to me to pay taxes on ICP assets that do not exist and have not been recorded on the ledger, but maybe I’m wrong.  It would be nice if someone who is a tax professional can comment on this detail.

Question 2 is really a tax strategy decision for each individual.  Personally I don’t want my maturity to accumulate in a neuron for many reasons including the reason you outlined.  Right now I am more interested in compounding voting rewards so they  grow faster and I can increase governance participation.  Many years down the road, I anticipate having a preference for liquidating rewards on a monthly basis.  Hence, I can’t relate to the decisions that are being made to allow maturity to grow significantly.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-13 17:29:18 UTC | #147

@wpb Just so you know, my own tax attorney has informed me that their best interpretation of the IRS's wishes (in the United States) is that simple accrual of maturity (happening each day) is the taxable event, and not the moment of minting by spawning or merging.

I'm not a tax attorney, and this is not a definitive answer or tax advice, just an indication that you may want to consult expert advice before suggesting any particular interpretation. We just don't know yet how the IRS will regard staking on the IC, and unfortunately we may not know until the first person who is audited can report back to us.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-12-14 04:06:26 UTC | #148

I'm guessing that the untapped maturity is mostly from seed round investors who are managing dozens of neurons through command line. For them, it might just be more of a hassle than it's worth to spawn the maturity.

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2021-12-19 12:30:17 UTC | #149

I'm sure that this thread is the wrong place, but I don't know where to ask this question. 
Sorry I'm not an expert and fairly new to ICP (invested since August)
I hope this is ok :slight_smile: 

I'm analyzing the reasons of the continuing price erosion and I think one point is that the circulating supply inflates more than the total supply. I use the data from the circulation dashboard (sorry can't insert a link somehow)

And it clearly shows that since Genesis the total supply has increased by 6,330,330 (~ 1.4%) but the circulating supply has increased by 67,759,778 (~55,1%) which is ten times larger than the inflation rate of the total supply. And I think the circulating supply has a much bigger impact on price development.

Are there any information why the inflation rate of the circulating supply is so much higher than the inflation rate of the total supply?

-------------------------

RatherIcy | 2021-12-19 12:47:29 UTC | #150

Inflation of the circulating supply is higher because of the monthly neuron unlocks. Every month a neuron with around 4 million ICP gets unlocked and slowly released into the market. The last one dissolved on Dec 10th and these will continue monthly for some time. I’m not exactly sure how many neurons are left, maybe someone else has that info. I wish I knew this before staking but it was a lot of documentation to read.

Thank you you two @RatherIcy and @LightningLad91! That clarified already a lot and the article is a very good reading.
I searched for the dissolving neurons in the next years and as I see it there will dissolve neurons every month in the next two years with each 1-4 million ICP (neuron 4009-40037). I will do further analysis but my intuition says that we should expect a price halving till the end of 2022 if the demand does not increase substantially since there will come a lot of ICP into the market and the reputation of the project is already struggling with the bad price development since Genesis. 
But after that period better times should come.

Another factor worth considering is the fact that Node Providers are paid monthly ICP in fiat equivalent, meaning if the price declines more ICP are minted to cover node costs. The good thing is, if demand for ICP increases those rewards will decrease.

Check out the Total Rewards chart in the dashboard link below to see how small node provider rewards are in the inflation story.  ICP price would need to be in the low single digits before it starts to compete with voting reward inflation.  By far the biggest contributor to inflation of circulating supply is the dissolving of genesis neurons.

Im very, very much in favor of any mechanism that reduces supply side and increases demand side. at current state there is so much supply and so little demand. in hindsight, this scenario should have been foreseen and addressed before the genesis event! Now its where it is and Im very much in favor of changing current tokenomics!

I would like to highlight an important risk raised previously, but which is becoming increasingly urgent. The risk is that of controllers of neurons with many followers ("high-follower-neurons") selling their neurons - and in effect, followers - one way or another. This possibility (or perhaps likelihood), ultimately undermines liquid democracy and the decentralization of governance on the IC, and I believe needs to be addressed quickly.

The post noted below outlines this risk. Appreciate review and comment.

Son terra luna çöküşü, sınırsız token ihracı ile enflasyonun degerleri nasıl yok ettiğini gördük. Şu an itibarı ile krpto piyasasının en itibarlı tokenomik modeli etherıumun modelidir. Mümkün ise sıfır enflasyon ile sistemin sürdürülmesi. Çünkü enflasyon degeri aşındırmaktadır. Agın çalışması için jetona da ihtiyaç var. O halde etherium bu dengeyi nasıl kurmuş ise, orta vadede İCP de bu dengeyi kurabilir ise jetonlar deger kazanır.

should we have a proposal on a maximum supply limit for $ICP??  to be able to limit the inflation of $ICP minted and increasing every day?  instead need better economic model for the growth of $ICP.

Seriously we need to revise tokennomics
Tired of talking on Twitter, no improvement forever

Liquidity escape, the collapse of retail investors, the outlet of seed rounders, the inability to overcome the narrative,

Many people openly say that aptos will become icp2.0 (-99%)

All this evil comes from poorly designed tokennomics

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here is another someone crazy proposal to reduce inflation :)
Have voluntary token burn mechanisms. Sounds crazy but with the right incentives people will burn their ICP :)

Step into the realm of voluntary token burn mechanisms, where the line between madness and brilliance blurs into a frenzy of excitement!  Imagine a world where every burnt ICP sparks a flame of change, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary with just the flicker of a virtual bonfire.

Step 1: Burn your ICP 
Embark on an adventure like no other as you journey to a website teeming with possibilities! Choose your destiny as you select from a myriad of options, from igniting a tiny spark with a fraction of ICP to unleashing the blaze with a golden inferno! Every burn fuels the flames of progress!

People go to a website as see options such as:
Burn 0.0001 ICP -> NNS Wallet gets 1 white star and 1 stick 🔥
Burn 0.001 ICP   -> NNS Wallet gets 2 white star and 2 sticks 🔥🔥
Burn 0.01 ICP     -> NNS Wallet gets 3 white star and 3 sticks 🔥🔥🔥
Burn 0.1ICP        -> NNS Wallet gets 4 white star and 4 sticks 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Burn 1 ICP          -> NNS Wallet gets 1 GOLDEN STAR ! and 1 branch  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Burn Custom Amount  -> NNS Wallet gets n number of stars and sticks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Step 2: Huge Bonfire Celebration!
Witness the spectacle of a lifetime as we gather around the roaring bonfire at the dawn of each month! Feel the heat as participants from around the globe unite to toss their sticks and branches into the fiery abyss! With each click, the blaze grows fiercer, fueled by the collective passion of the community!

-Only wallets with sticks/branches can participate but anyone can go to the bonfire to celebrate!
-Whatever sticks are left over, get automatically burned OR they can save n number of sticks for a later bonfire.
-At the top of the website are a sorted list of wallet profiles that participated the burn this month for recognition! 
-At the bottom of the website is a chat for people to hang out (like an OpenChat hangout)

Step 3: Reward
Prepare to reap the rewards of your fiery devotion as 95% of the ICP in the burn wallets is consumed by the flames of change! But wait, what about the other 5%?! One lucky soul shall emerge from the ashes as the recipient of 5% of the ICP, chosen by fate itself!

The wallets with stars get more valuable as they are more rare. These stars are permanently etched to that wallet's identity and of course can get sold for a higher price of IDGeek. Behold the birth of a new era, where stars shine brighter than ever before! These celestial treasures, etched into the very fabric of your wallet's identity, become coveted symbols of prestige and power!

Of course there could be other incentive such as NFTs or a ticket to meet Dominic Williams haha.
The rewards and number of winner can very month to month.
