Hello all,

Join **DFINITY Education** for a second workshop on Governance today (5/24) at 11am PST. More info on the [event page](https://www.meetup.com/internet-computer-education-meetup/events/gdhthsycchbgc/).

--

This is part of an ongoing series of community-oriented workshops that run on a weekly basis. As weâ€™ve previously shared, **DFINITY Education** is an effort to help students get up-to-speed with IC development through the lens of traditional computer science concepts. Its [Github repos](https://github.com/DFINITY-Education/) include several modules and are meant to serve as the backbone for educators looking to build out their own computer science coursework offerings.

Community workshops take place every Monday at 11am PST. To stay up-to-date with all things **DFINITY Education** , make sure to sign up for our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/internet-computer-education-meetup/).

Hope to see you there! Feel free to message me or @csolimano with any questions or suggestions you have.
