So finally my staked ICP has appeared  and in the neuron tab "UNLOCKED". I have a neuron ID and my amount is correct.

I have two Options:
1) Increase Dissolve Delay (I assume "LOCKS" the Neuron for my desired set time frame, is this correct?)
2) Disburse (If i click this I can only assume because my neurons aren't "LOCKED" it will move my ICP tokens back to my main wallet, is this correct?)

Now I have some more ICP I got in the dip i want to add to this Neuron ID... Can someone please confirm how this is done correctly?

1) Is it best to do this when my Neurons are unlocked?
2) Is it safe to do this on a iPhone safari? 

Someone said on reddit it's as simple as transfer ICP to the address the original neuron was created on...

Thanks for any help possible.

I would like to know as well. I understand from another user’s post that I should be able to transfer ICP to the existing Neuron like any other account, but the identifier shown for my neuron is not an actual account number so I don’t know how to find that information.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 10:00:13 UTC | #3

Click on your wallet “main” section where your ICP amount is listed. It will take you to another screen where you’re transactions are. You should see the wallet/staking address in there.

1. Increase Dissolve Delay (I assume “LOCKS” the Neuron for my desired set time frame, is this correct?)
A Yes 
2. Disburse (If i click this I can only assume because my neurons aren’t “LOCKED” it will move my ICP tokens back to my main wallet, is this correct?) 
A: Yes

1. Is it best to do this when my Neurons are unlocked?
You can add ICPs even when neurons are locked but I guess for clarity it's better to start with the entire balance at the same time. 

2. Is it safe to do this on a iPhone safari?
Yes, but I've heard people complaining that old updates are not working as they should so make sure you update to the latest version. Also make sure you add multiple devices as well. 

Personally I'm waiting for ledger hardware support and then I'll use that as my main device + macbook + phone just to be sure.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 11:00:11 UTC | #5

Thanks mate,

Can I assume you just transfer the ICP to the same contract address that you originally staked too?

Also you only earn the ICP once it’s locked right? Basically having them staked and unlocked does nothing?

-------------------------

Gabriel | 2021-05-20 12:11:30 UTC | #6

> Can I assume you just transfer the ICP to the same contract address that you originally staked too?

Yeah that should be the case.

> Also you only earn the ICP once it’s locked right? Basically having them staked and unlocked does nothing?

locked and the dissolve delay set for > 6 moths AND voting but you can follow dfinity foundation and that takes care of your issue.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 11:34:31 UTC | #7

So yea I followed the foundations on all the voting groups. So I can leave my neuron unlocked and earn ICP? or I have to lock greater the 6 months to earn ICP rewards?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-20 12:04:05 UTC | #8

@Jello You can only vote and in turn receive voting rewards if your lockup period is at least 6 months.

Also, the voting rewards you get are dependent on your voting power which increases as you lock up your ICP for longer durations.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-20 12:05:37 UTC | #9

This is my exact question right now.  I think in principle you can go to your main account, create the new transaction, and send to the address of your staked neuron.  However, this isn't working for me as expected.  I have tried twice with small amounts of ICP (1 ICP and 0.1 ICP).  The first time was before the staking was fixed and my ICP did not show up in my neuron.  I submitted a support ticket, but got no response.  After dfinity posted that staking was fixed, the ICP did show up in my neuron.  I tried a second time yesterday with an even smaller amount of ICP and again it has not shown up in my neuron 12 hours later.  I want to increase the amount of ICP in my neuron so it can spawn faster and I can "dividend reinvest" faster, so I'd prefer not to create new neurons every time I want to stake.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 12:07:36 UTC | #10

 I sent a small amount of ICP to the address it originally staked to, the transaction shows as completed at https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org but my neuron staked amount has changed either :(

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-20 12:10:06 UTC | #11

@Gabriel you can vote as long as your dissolve delay is > 6 months regardless of if the neuron is in the dissolving state or locked state.

Regarding topping up neurons... Currently if you send ICP to an existing neuron's address the neuron will not automatically be updated to reflect this increased amount.

This is something that will be added to the NNS app shortly but for now if you have already sent ICP to the neuron's address you will need to contact support and they can refresh the neuron's balance for you.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 12:11:57 UTC | #12

Awesome thanks mate I will send the rest of my ICP and get support to update!!!

-------------------------

Gabriel | 2021-05-20 12:13:00 UTC | #13

Yeah I know, but those were not my questions, I was trying to reply but forgot to use Blockquote :)

> This is something that will be added to the NNS app shortly but for now if you have already sent ICP to the neuron’s address you will need to contact support and they can refresh the neuron’s balance for you.

Hmm I thought that bug was fixed, thanks

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 12:25:25 UTC | #14

Any suggestions on what to included in the support ticket???


Neuron Id, main wallet address and staking address enough?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-20 12:30:42 UTC | #15

I'm pretty sure they will just need your principal (which you can find on the Neurons tab) + the neuron's address

-------------------------

wyz | 2021-05-20 12:48:47 UTC | #16

Can I adding some more ICP to my existed Neuron rather than not to create new one?

-------------------------

wyz | 2021-05-20 12:54:02 UTC | #17

I have 10 ICP, 
1. create one Neuron with 10 ICP
2. create two Neuron with 5 ICP each
Which way I can get reward of ICP more effectively

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-20 13:06:04 UTC | #18

Both would be exactly the same.

Your voting power grows linearly with your stake, so if you double the stake, that neuron will get double the rewards.

And yes you can add to an existing neuron, you need to send tokens to the neuron's address (this will be the address the original 'stake neuron' transaction was sent to), and then email support with your principal and the neuron's address and they can refresh its balance.

-------------------------

ICPNorway | 2021-05-20 13:19:09 UTC | #19

Could you add this to https://status.internetcomputer.org/ so that we can track the process of fixing this issue?

-------------------------

wyz | 2021-05-20 13:22:34 UTC | #20

@hpeebles Thanks you a lot, Buddy

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-20 13:28:07 UTC | #21

There is an important difference between staking with higher amounts of ICP in a single neuron vs splitting ICP into multiple neurons.  Even though the growth rate is the same (assuming dissolve delay and neuron age are equal), the time it takes to reach the threshold required to spawn a new neuron and release the ICP voting rewards is different.  From what I understand, you don't reach the threshold maturity necessary to spawn a new neuron until you accumulate 1 ICP of voting rewards (which is the minimum ICP necessary to create a new neuron).

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-20 13:37:06 UTC | #22

I raised my support ticket as requested by @hpeebles.. I will let you know how it goes and if my balance gets refreshed:)

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-20 13:41:42 UTC | #23

Thank you.  I was just about to reply and ask you to give us an update when it is complete.  Also, thank you for raising this specific question in the dfininty forum.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-20 13:43:29 UTC | #24

Why does this need manual action from the support to display?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-20 14:08:56 UTC | #25

Account balances are held in the ledger canister whereas the details of each neuron are held in the governance canister. To update a neuron's balance you need to send tokens to its account in the ledger and then also notify the governance canister that the neuron's balance has been updated.

Until the governance canister is notified of the updated balance your rewards will be given out based on your original balance. This notification cannot be done via the NNS app yet so for now you need to send your principal + the neuron address to support and they can notify the governance canister of the updated balance.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-20 14:12:35 UTC | #26

Thank you for your explanation!
But we can still notify by calling with dfx from the command line using `notify_dfx`, right?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-20 14:28:16 UTC | #27

Yes you can use dfx too! I'll build the dfx command. I could do with an example to test it with though.

If someone has sent tokens to an existing neuron and has their principal + the neuron address to hand I can test my command to make sure it works.

It won't be using 'notify_dfx' by the way.

There is a new method on the governance canister called 'claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account' which should be used for this.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-20 16:35:55 UTC | #28

This sounds interesting.  I have no programming experience, but wouldn’t mind learning more about these types of details.  Would you be willing/able to share?  I don’t have a sense of whether this is a big ask or an easy ask, so my apologies if its too big of an ask.  I don’t even know what it means to use dfx commands.

-------------------------

ray | 2021-05-20 21:01:38 UTC | #29

How long do you expect the implementation to take until the ICP gets updated automatic when adding to a Neuron? thanks!

-------------------------

nerdoutcj | 2021-05-20 22:05:42 UTC | #30

Just to be clear - toping up a neuron will have an impact on its maturity.

Awesome thank you I am doing this close to my original stake on the 20th so minimal impact now. But great info for future staking! Maybe better to create a new neuron.

I have created and locked the new one. Not sure on the difference and/or impact of multiple neurons vs. topping up the existing one. 

Would be great if someone gives a run down or points to the source of information.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-21 09:26:30 UTC | #35

no difference apart from hitting the maturity threshhold to spawn a new neuron earlier. apparently your rewards need to be > 1 ICP to spawn a new neuron.

Is it normal about the fee don't refunded?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-05-21 09:34:31 UTC | #37

Currently subnets are still being added so not everyone can deploy on mainnet right now. There is a small penalty of ICP being burned for the deploy call, probably to prevent flooding the network.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-21 10:07:41 UTC | #41

Hey mate I raise a ticket for my neuron refresh, is support under the pump at the moment? When could I expect a response do you think?

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-21 13:17:59 UTC | #42

Hi @wyz.  Our friend @Jello also provided the link to support at support.dfinity.org. You then select “submit a request” in the upper right corner of the page.

I don’t know what info support needs to notify the governance canister of the incoming transfer, so what I submitted in the support ticket was my NNS account address the transfer came from (Account page), the neuron address the transfer was sent to (from transaction history page as you have shown in red), and the neuron account number (Neuron page).

As with @Jello, I have not heard anything back from support and my 0.1 ICP transfer has not shown up in my neuron yet as displayed on the NNS app.  Hopefully support will get to it sometime today.  That said, I did check my neuron wallet transactions on dashboard.internetcomputer.org and the 0.1 ICP transfer does show up.  Hence, the ICP is not lost...the governance canister just doesn't know about it.  This might also mean that it may not be receiving staking rewards until the governance canister is notified.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-21 11:58:19 UTC | #43

Let’s hope support pick up the pace. We all want the project to get over these cosmetic problems so we get on with the real vision.

-------------------------

ICPNorway | 2021-05-22 05:15:04 UTC | #44

Any update here? Have people heared back from support and gotten their neurons updated?

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-22 23:54:39 UTC | #45

Still waiting unfortunately obviously support aren’t ready yet. Hopefully they pick up their  game soon. 

I see the conflict:

1) support are spending time helping people deploy their ideas on ICP
2) support don’t  have time to help the investment/finance side of the model.

Hopefully this gets balanced soon.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-22 11:24:57 UTC | #46

I have not heard back from support yet either.  I’m waiting to stake more ICP until this issue is resolved, so really interested in seeing it resolved soon.  It seems like this is fundamental to the ICP governance tokenomics and should have a higher priority.  It’s not even identified as a known issue.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-05-22 18:23:46 UTC | #47

Hello. I was wondering if you were still working on a command that we could use to refresh our staked neurons; do you still need someone to provide you with a Prin-ID and Neuron address to use?

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-05-22 20:40:59 UTC | #48

I actually DMed him mine but no response so far.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-05-22 20:42:40 UTC | #49

ok, i was wondering if anyone did, thanks!

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-23 00:09:33 UTC | #50

Sorry for being slow to get back to you on this!

Try this command -
dfx canister --network=mercury --no-wallet call governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account ‘(record {controller=principal “your principal Id”; memo=your memo})’

Alternatively you can paste your principal and then either your account identifier or the memo from your stake neuron transaction (I can find the memo form the account identifier via this page https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/) and I can run the command for you since I think running it may require that you have access to the governance canister candid file.

That goes out to anyone who wants to refresh their neuron stake. Simply send me your details and I'll run the command to refresh the stake.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-05-23 01:23:18 UTC | #51

Thank you for the response and for offering to help. I am curious if I can get this to run myself. If not then I will definitely DM you my neuron info.

So I tried running the command you provided and it responded with:

"ComputeNetworkNotFound(mercury)"

So i set --network=ic and ran it again. This time I got the following error:

"The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai trapped explicitly: Panicked at 'Deserialization Failed: "Deserialize error: Type mismatch. Type on the wire: Int; Expected type: Nat64"', /builds/dfinity-lab-dfinity/rs/rust_canisters/dfn_core/src/endpoint.rs:123:21"

I have a feeling this is a problem with the way I passed the memo or principal ID. I pasted the principal Id exactly as it is displayed on the Neuron tab, quotes included. The memo was just a large number. Was I supposed to put something around the memo ID?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-23 01:33:38 UTC | #52

Here's one I did that worked -
dfx canister --network=mercury --no-wallet call governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account '(record {controller=principal "bmgju-swk3a-vmjqt-d5f2n-zouhf-b2obh-4wyx2-yozlx-ykgsf-qt2ch-nqe"; memo=11815817180990677432})'

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-05-23 01:35:33 UTC | #53

Thank you again!

So I got the command to work but I had to add ":nat64" to the end of my memo id. 

I checked my neuron and it did update everything.

Thank you so much for the help!

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-23 01:42:33 UTC | #54

@hpeebles thanks for all the help with running the refresh command. I closed my ticket I will need to learn how to run these commands for the future.

He has now responded and he has refreshed my neuron. He said he had been swamped with work.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-23 04:08:07 UTC | #56

I'm not sure if I should know this already, but it's something I haven't taken the time to learn about IC yet...where are the private keys?  Are any of the principal ID, the neuron number, the neuron crypto address, or the memo considered the private keys for ICP?  Are the private keys handled transparently behind the scenes via a handshake with our Internet Identity such that they are never exposed?  Are there any private keys at all?  My apologies if this is a dumb question.

Also, to run your command line on my computer, will I need to install the DFINITY Canister Software Development Kit (SDK)?

-------------------------

wyz | 2021-05-23 05:25:46 UTC | #57

I wanna know where you got your ICP, just bought from coin market like Coinbase？

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-05-23 06:28:55 UTC | #58

Yes it’s on all major exchanges like binance, coinbase …

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-05-23 09:17:15 UTC | #59

How practical is it for the team to give airdrop recipients the option to either keep receiving their tokens monthly or stake them in a neuron? Perhaps ask us to create a neuron and then Coinlist dumps the remaining tokens there for us.

I think the team should consider that, it'll give us the option of participating in governance & get rewards during the 1 year wait.

In case this is not your area, who should I be talking to about this?

Thanks

Hey @nerdoutcj, @wyz, @wpb, @Jello,

Here's some information on *how to distribute the ICP to maximize the voting reward*:

Basically, the more voting power we get, the more reward we're supposed gain.
And there're three factors related to voting power:
1. The number of locked ICP
2. The length of dissolve delay
3. The age of  the neuron


Here's the detail:
**1.The number of locked ICP:** With all other things being equal,  the more ICP you locked, the more reward  you're supposed to get.

**2. The length of dissolve delay:** With all other things being equal, the longer you set the dissolve delay, the more reward  you're supposed to get.

**3. The age of  the neuron:** With all other things being equal, the older the neuron is, the more reward  you're supposed to get.
* Only locked neuron has age. The neuron starts aging when the neuron was created or last stopped dissolving. 
* Whenever a neuron starts dissolving, its age is reset to zero and remains zero while it is dissolving. And if the dissolving state turned off, then the neuron starts aging again, from zero.
* Refresh the stake will change(decrease) the maturity and age of the neuron prorated.

Here's some usual situation, saying:

1. I have 10 ICP, and have not yet created any neurons:  
a) create one Neuron with 10 ICP
b) create two Neuron with 5 ICP each
**Understanding:** according the three factors talking above, with all other things being equal, a) and b) will gain the same reward.

2. I have already created a neuron with 5 ICP, now I get 5 more ICP on hand:
a) create a new Neuron with 5 ICP
b) add the 5 ICP to the existed neuron
**Understanding:**
   * The difference between a) and b) is that, b) will firstly refresh(decrease) the existed neuron's age.
   * That means it will simultaneously affect two factors: increasing the number of staking ICP, and decreasing the age of neuron. 
   * Quoting from [< Understanding the Internet Computer’s Network Nervous System, Neurons, and ICP Utility Tokens>:](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8) *"if the stake is doubled, the maturity and age will be halved, so spawning will yield the same amount and the age bonus will be the same as before (in absolute terms)."*.  
    * It means at the current top-up time, the overall rewards will not change. But when the neuron grows as old as before, it will yield more than before. 
    * This suggests that, if the existed neuron is old enough, don't bother to add more ICP into it, instead, creating a new neuron will be just fine. Anyway, it will not hurt the overall reward.

Above is my personal understanding currently, not official answers.
It could be wrong or will evolve, so please do check and verify them by yourself.
And further discussion is warmly welcomed.

Chris | 2021-05-24 13:50:58 UTC | #67

It does, but your reward amount remains the same in the end as the maturity is just stating how much percent of your stake you can expect to see in a freshly spawned neuron.

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-25 03:00:12 UTC | #68

This is excellent info thanks mate. 

Now here's a couple of questions:

1) If I staked my neuron for 8 years, can I just increase the dissolve delay every 6 months back out to 8years? If so I assume you could get a neuron age over 8 years old!
2) When I spawn a neuron from Maturity will this impact or affect the age of the original neuron or is maturity a separate function to original neuron?

-------------------------

christophediprima | 2021-05-25 15:03:23 UTC | #69

Can’t have the command running on my Mac! It says “error: Found argument ‘–no-wallet’ which wasn’t expected, or isn’t valid in this context”.

Any idea on what’s going wrong? Would be nice I could run it myself but here are my details, would be awesome to if someone could execute the command for me!

**principal Id:** t2u5w-xamy3-wzf2u-bgfxx-wiv4h-mezc7-v6pbe-oblz4-bzzub-44qvv-vae
**Memo:** 5040378567644815886

-------------------------

Damon | 2021-05-25 22:32:01 UTC | #70

1. Technically, yes, you can do that. But by doing that, you'll not get a neuron age over 8 years old. 2 reasons for that:
   * Neuron starts aging only at locked status, as long as you start dissolving, the age of neuron will be reset to 0.
   * When the maturity of a neuron has risen above a threshold, it can be instructed to spawn a new neuron. When a neuron spawns a new neuron, its maturity falls to zero, so it'll not be 8 years old.
   * To achieve what you want, you may do like this: locked your neuron with setting 8 years dissolve delay, and do not start dissolving it. So, it'll starts aging with the maximum 8 years dissolve delay, and there's no need to increase the dissolve delay.

2. When the maturity of a neuron has risen above a threshold, it can be instructed to spawn a new neuron. When a neuron spawns a new neuron, its maturity falls to zero.
   * The exact threshold value is not known, it seems to be controlled by algorithm.
   * Here's an example: *a neuron that contains 100 ICP and has a maturity of 10 percent can spawn a new neuron that contains 10 ICP in expectation. Newly spawned neurons have a dissolve delay of only one day, allowing the ICP locked inside to be easily retrieved if desired. Of course, the newly spawned neuron has an age of zero days.*
   * Reference: [Understanding the Internet Computer’s Network Nervous System, Neurons, and ICP Utility Tokens](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8),「Algorithm」part.

There's two fundamental and critical concept to understand staking & rewarding: Lock & Dissolve.
* Lock the neuron, then they'll be Locked status, so they can start aging. The older, the better reward.
* Dissolve the neuron, then they'll be Dissolving status, and their age will be reset to 0. Still, you can get reward, but it will be less since its age is 0.

The basic idea is, if you want more reward, you long and lock them, and there's nothing else you need to do. By understanding this, I truly realize the simplicity and beauty behind this mechanism.

Sorted!

Your memo was wrong by the way, but I found the correct one here -
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/fef2f716a5a9afa187fad47d2c3e617ed8c4188e807cc6ee07d32a0fd85c9fe9

Then I ran this command and it refreshed the neuron -
dfx canister --network=mercury --no-wallet call governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account '(record {controller=principal "t2u5w-xamy3-wzf2u-bgfxx-wiv4h-mezc7-v6pbe-oblz4-bzzub-44qvv-vae"; memo=8312538503409505771})'

The --no-wallet argument was introduced in DFX version 0.7.0 which I don't think has been made generally available.
But you can still install it by running the following -
DFX_VERSION=0.7.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

Or you may just be able to run the command without the --no-wallet arg but I'm not 100% sure on that one.

Can we have a dedicated increase stake button?

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-26 18:33:17 UTC | #76

I finally heard back from Dfinity Support today and they have updated my neuron in the NNS app.  They didn't indicate if the solution was specific to my neuron or across the board.  So if anyone is still having issues with their ICP showing up in their neuron after a transfer to an existing neuron, then I still suggest submitting a support ticket.  I also read in a different thread (either in this forum or on reddit) that dfinity is working on an update tot he NNS app that will address this issue.  Hopefully the issue is going to be broadly resolved soon.

-------------------------

zbraniecki | 2021-05-27 07:08:01 UTC | #77

I tried calling command line to refresh:
```
▶ dfx canister --network=mercury --no-wallet call governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account '(record {controller=principal “uoxxr-i33aa-oqdxa-efquo-jznod-bdl7j-d52af-sdcyb-bkj46-xhpbj-hae”; memo=3106565063110009896})'c
ComputeNetworkNotFound(mercury)
```

I tried switching `--network=mercury` to `--network=ic`:

```
▶ dfx canister --network=ic --no-wallet call governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account '(record {controller=principal “uoxxr-i33aa-oqdxa-efquo-jznod-bdl7j-d52af-sdcyb-bkj46-xhpbj-hae”; memo=3106565063110009896})'
Cannot find canister id. Please issue 'dfx canister --network ic create governance'.
```

What am I doing wrong? I feel like the missing step is that I'm not authenticated so may not have access to nns identity (I only did `dfx new example` and `cd` into it before calling this). How should I authenticate myself or if it's not an authentication issue, how can I get to the point where I can execute the command myself to refresh neuron?

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-27 11:30:38 UTC | #78

Hey @hpeebles  what are the chances of the nns having a refresh button on the neuron page? Would tidy up the last of these headaches that’s for sure!

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-27 14:28:24 UTC | #79

Yep! This is being worked on and should make its way to live over the next few days

-------------------------

zbraniecki | 2021-05-27 16:17:42 UTC | #80

@hpeebles - can you refresh it for me? My principal is "uoxxr-i33aa-oqdxa-efquo-jznod-bdl7j-d52af-sdcyb-bkj46-xhpbj-hae".
As for memo, I'm not sure how to pick the right one from - https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/a2a7736511cb4c69a375a49c61778ddecd51ca64c7bd9cf8b37a2850913b94f6?p=1

the latest transation seems to have `0`?

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-27 17:21:27 UTC | #81

I've just refreshed it!

The memo needs to be taken from the first transaction to the neuron's address.

In your case it is this transaction - 
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/f7d163036a34f123517e27817f94ef19cca9836e5dd36008daac651f17a1b452

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-28 05:45:13 UTC | #82

This will be amazing!

A new video guiding people through the process would be super beneficial especially after all these fixes have been deployed.

@hpeebles is there any .did spec or documentation on this mystery method `claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account` ?

If doubling the ICP stake of a neuron results in the maturity getting halved, what's the benefit of topping up an existing neuron with more ICP?

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-05-31 11:26:00 UTC | #87

No extra benefit other than having all in a single location. But it should allow for easy handling. If you decide to change your followees in future for instance, you can do it all in a single place.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-05-31 15:28:57 UTC | #88

Done!

The overall maturity in terms of ICP stays the same when you top up a neuron, but since we display it as a percentage of the amount staked it will appear reduced.

-------------------------

dabzor420 | 2021-05-31 16:29:00 UTC | #89

Thank you sir everything looks good.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-05-31 20:01:33 UTC | #90

Has this app update (refresh neuron) been implemented?  I don’t see any new buttons (other than an address copy, which is appreciated).  Does the new refresh button only appear after you send ICP to an existing neuron?

-------------------------

Jello | 2021-05-31 21:12:19 UTC | #91

Pretty certain it hasn’t been done yet. Just got mine manually refreshed again.

-------------------------

dtvrse | 2021-06-01 10:27:12 UTC | #92

Hi, I'm having the same issue as [zbraniecki](/u/zbraniecki) earlier: whenever I call the governance claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account command, I get the error: ComputeNetworkNotFound(mercury).
I have the dfx running on localhost and I'm pretty sure I have the principal and memo right. What am I missing to refresh the neuron stake? Thanks!

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2021-06-02 13:21:24 UTC | #93

This `claim_or_refresh_neuron_from_account` should be added to the dids in the IC repository!

-------------------------

zbraniecki | 2021-06-04 04:53:05 UTC | #94

@hpeebles - can I ask for another refresh?

principal: "uoxxr-i33aa-oqdxa-efquo-jznod-bdl7j-d52af-sdcyb-bkj46-xhpbj-hae"
memo: "3422782772760842249"

Thank you!

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-04 08:39:04 UTC | #95

It will be soon! AFAIK that repo is 1 release version behind live (this may not always be 100% true, plus different components can be released separately anyway).

And since that function is brand new and is only in the latest release, it hasn't made its way to that repo yet.

@zbraniecki Done!

-------------------------

zbraniecki | 2021-06-04 20:54:53 UTC | #96

Thank you @hpeebles !

I'm now trying to reason about investment model that should be optimal for the NNS staking logic.

Let's assume I have 10 ICP locked in a Neuron. If I understand the model properly, I need to reach maturity 10% to be able to spawn a new neuron (10 ICP * 10% = 100%). is that correct?

If so, then I have a choice between spawning immediately when I reach 100% in order to make the new ICP start contributing to staking, or I can wait until my maurity * ICP count gets to a larger number and spawn more then. Is that correct?

And then, when I spawn it, I can either add it to the existing neuron (which reduces maturity) or create a new neuron.

What's the difference between those three strategies (spawn immediately and add to the original neuron, wait until more maturity accrues and spawn more and start a new neuron or add to the existing one).

How should one reason about those strategies?

-------------------------

xiaochengzou | 2021-06-05 00:09:39 UTC | #97

Is there any timeline on supporting stacking more ICP to existing neuron via self-service, instead of asking hpeebles to do the refresh?
If not, can we +1 on the support so dfinite team can prioritize the work? 
Thanks!

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-05 00:17:03 UTC | #98

Since the update we put out yesterday, neurons created since May 19th can be topped up by simply sending more ICP to the address the original stake neuron transaction went to.

For neurons created before that date we'll hopefully have a fix out next week.

The reason neurons created before May 19th don't work is because before that date we didn't collect the memo values which are needed to perform the refresh.

You can check if it will work for your neuron by finding the original 'Stake Neuron' transaction in your transaction list. If it is marked as 'Stake Neuron' then topping up will work automatically, if it is labelled as 'Send' then it will still have to be manual.

But as you know... until the fix goes live you can send me your details and it takes me quite literally 10 seconds to sort it :wink:

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-05 00:19:41 UTC | #99

We want to make the user experience better too... so soon there will be a nice and simple 'Top Up' button on each neuron.

We had to build the functionality to support this first (which we've now done), making it easy to use will follow ASAP!

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-06-05 00:33:33 UTC | #100

There has been a murmuring of people talking about potentially supporting compounding interest where each day (if opted in) your rewards are automatically added to your current stake. There's nothing concrete on this yet. But keep an eye out for this functionality as it would be the most lucrative way to turn your ICP into more ICP.

-------------------------

xiaochengzou | 2021-06-05 00:48:04 UTC | #101

Thanks hpeebles! I’ve created my neuron before May 19th, and I didn’t find the “stake neuron” label on the Original stacking transaction (neither the “send” label actually, but I guess it defaults to “send”), so I think the fix doesn’t apply mine. 

I am going to wait next week then. 

Btw, I am impressed that you guys fix issues quickly. Nice job!
