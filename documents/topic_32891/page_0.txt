I see that other chains are seeking technology for gas-free transfers, such as a certain stablecoin. This was mentioned in a tweet by someone who deployed on TRX. Maybe the Dfinity team could talk to them about forming some kind of partnership. I think it might be possible to achieve this by issuing a CKTRX or CKTRXUSDT, or something similarï¼Ÿ
