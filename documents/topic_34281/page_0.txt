I am looking for an IC hosted data storage solution that can be used to persist and retrieve data (files, images, text content etc). It must be performant, accessible to a backend canister architecture and scale without intervention. Have looked at a couple of solutions but they now appear to be dormant or not fit for purpose.

Any ideas?

I have developed a storage Infura called ICDA, and you can refer to the project introduction at [Project Introduction](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internetcomputer-da-layer-showcase/33956
). 

It is currently in the MVP version, with main features including K-V storage and the generation of storage proofs for the stored data (which can be understood as a Merkle Tree plus Signature). 

I have already stored more than 20G of data, and ICDA is performing very well. 

Are you interested in using my solution?
