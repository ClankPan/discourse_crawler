Given that a #[update] might cause a random function (i.e. raw_rand --> vec<u8>) to execute and if I were to store the output of that function in the replica's state (static mut ...), it seems that each replica would store a different vec<u8>. Is this correct understanding?

Not correct, because the IC random generator goes through consensus.
