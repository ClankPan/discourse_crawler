Laughter is the best medicine, and as crypto enthusiasts this joke should crack a smile in a bear market around family tables 🙏

**A guy said to God, “God, is it true that to you a billion years is like a second?”**

***God said yes.***

**The guy said, “God, is it true that to you a billion dollars is like a penny?”**

**God said yes.**

**The guy said, “God, can I have a penny?”**

**God said, “Sure, just a second.”**

…😂😂😂
