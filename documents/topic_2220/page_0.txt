I am making a CURD [project](https://github.com/FUTingFei/djob) like linkedup, here is a [tutorial](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/access-control.html) about how to add  access control with motoko but I want to know how to add  access control with javascript in frontend(react)?

We are working on some examples on this topic, and hope to have them for you soon! In the meantime, and on the whole, I would recommend thinking of your canister like an API. Even though we are coming up with a pattern to generate principal ID's per-browser, there's nothing preventing you from using a user name and password, or to integrate with a 3rd party OATH solution. 

PS don't forget to salt your passwords! ðŸ§‚
