Hello!
I'm working on a project and looking for help from people with a bit more knowledge and experience than me in Motoko, React, and JavaScript. 
It's a project in the NFT arena. It's currently under development but as soon as it is ready I will apply for a grant, look for investors, and begin fundraising. It is a truly exciting project and I truly believe it could change the way the NFT market is currently running. contact me if you would like to get more details.
Thank you for your help.

Hi @Chaimalbi 
If you have specific technical questions, feel free to just post them here. 

You can apply for a grant at any point. Some of the projects we give a grant have not started yet, and some are further along.
