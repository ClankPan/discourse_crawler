There is a line:
--memo=244837814094590 \ # Include a numeric memo.
Help me understand what this memo means and which number exactly should i write there?

Hey @alabamalama,

There is a description in the [Integrate with the Internet Computer ledger documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/integration/ledger-quick-start.html):

> Any transaction can store an 8-byte memo â€” this memo field is used by the Rosetta API to store the nonce that distinguishes between transactions. However, other uses for the field are possible.

This feature is useful to disambiguate transactions (with the same source, destination and amount).
