I use rust create user profile module, and I referenced the wall project, I tried to create local user data, always fail, do you know why?

'''
    let profile_store = storage::get_mut::<ProfileStore>();
    profile_store.insert(principal_id, profile.clone());

'''

Iâ€™m not sure if this is the cause but @AdamS removed that API recently:

An alternative approach is recommended by @roman-kashitsyn here:
