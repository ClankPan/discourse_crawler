The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposal today, 2023-08-07. DFINITY plans to vote on this proposal on Thursday, 2023-08-10.

## This Release

Disable OpenSnsTokenSwap proposals in NNS governance. This is a temporary measure to prevent the possibility that multiple proposals of this type can be opened simultaneously. This feature will be re-enabled (via a subsequent upgrade proposal) after the proper fix is implemented.
