When I try to download a part of a HTML file:

```text
curl -H 'range: 1-10' -v https://XXX.icp0.io/
```

I get

```
x-ic-streaming-response: false
```

What does it mean? Why isn't it streamed? Why don't I get only bytes 1-10, but the entire HTML? How to change to `x-ic-streaming-response: true`?

The asset canister does not support streaming yet. I plan to work on it soon
