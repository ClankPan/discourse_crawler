So Dominic tweeted : "https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1441411796678684673" about community fund neurons

It appears to be written in present tense: 

Neurons can be configured as "community fund neurons"

Should I read this to mean that I can invest in a neuron today in this manner? I suppose that there are some tricky issues to deal with in this context.

Are there any such current opportunities that are out there?  Is this even allowed within the dfinity forum? Or should it be outside the dfinity forum?
