Fetching manifest https://sdk.dfinity.org/manifest.json
Creating new project "test"...
...

$ cd test
$ dfx deploy --network ic --no-wallet
Deploying all canisters.
Creating canisters...
Creating canister "test"...
Error: The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content: <html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>

Bad error message, I know. Will be fixed in 0.10.0.
The real error message should be `No wallet found/configured for identity XXX on network ic`, meaning that you have to have a wallet set up/created/configured for your identity (or use a different identity with the wallet configured). The flag `--no-wallet` affects who will control the created canisters, but it is no longer necessary as it is implied by now IIRC. If you skip the flag you should get the same result.
