Hi community, Cristian here from ICP Hub Mexico :wave: 

***This is a proposal to create a Known Neuron from our Hub for Spanish-speaking regions :muscle:*** 

ICP Hub M√©xico, previously known as ICP Hub Latam, is one of the Hubs with the mission of bringing the technology, education, and opportunities of the Internet Computer ecosystem to Spanish-speaking regions.

For the past year, we have created and conducted bootcamps each month on various technologies such as Motoko and Azle, reaching over 1000 participants in our educational spaces. This effort has been carried out in collaboration with institutions, organizations, companies, and universities.

We are a team of 8 people who coordinate the activities of this hub and are responsible for driving the adoption of the ecosystem in multiple countries in Latin America.

**Team Members:**

* Claudio Cossio
* Cristina Loustaunau
* Cristian Zambrano
* Luz Margarita
* Issac Klassen
* Manuel Haro
* Mariangel Blanco
* Jorge Badillo

**Why create a Known Neuron?**

As one of the Hubs where English is not our primary language, we have faced numerous situations where it becomes very difficult for the community to share their talent to build this great ecosystem.

We want to be a voice for all those who are part of the Latin American community and whose trust in us translates into representation so that decentralization in ecosystem decision-making also includes those Spanish speakers who have been unable to participate due to the language barrier.

We believe that the NNS (Network Nervous System) demonstrates that we can have a globally participative ecosystem and that this will be an opportunity to involve Latinos in ICP governance.

**What topics will we vote on?**

From the beginning, our Hub has been focused on training Hispanic developers to be capable of building with ICP technology. Therefore, we will follow topics that encompass governance and technology such as:

* System Canister Management
* Governance
* Subnet Management
* Node Admin

**Neuron Control**

For now, the control of the neuron will be my responsibility, as the person in charge of the technological/educational part of the Hub. As one of the founding members, I have undertaken the following activities, which have earned trust in me:

* I have coordinated the design, continuous update, and implementation of educational programs for developers to date.
* I have the task of guiding Latin projects built on ICP through our incubator for DApps called Zona Tres Labs.
* Every week, I participate in R&D meetings to stay abreast of the latest developments ICP brings to the ecosystem.

At the same time, the founding team of the Hub has access to the identity where this neuron was created, and decisions will be made consensually, as has been our experience in coordinating this Hub.

We want Latin America to participate actively in ICP governance and to be a bridge for those looking to drive this great ecosystem forward.

LATAM talent has a lot to contribute to achieve the implementation and improvement of the IC Protocol.
Become that development pole that provides solutions to the problems of the context of this region.
The participation of the ICP Hub Mexico community in making decisions that lead to having a decentralized protocol will be essential :ok_hand: :grinning:

I totally agree, there is work ahead that will be developed efficiently by the ICP Hub M√©xico :100: :raised_hands:
