Hi All,

I am trying to deploy my hello world app on Dfinity. While installing npm using 'sudo apt install npm' or 'npm install', it is not able to locate and install npm. I guess because of this, when I try to deploy, it shows: 'Connection refused (os error 11). Can anybody please help?

Thanks,
Pushpraj

Follow this to install npm on your system first
https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

After you installed npm, inside your project directory run `npm install`. 

Another thing you need to do is running `dfx start` fron inside your project directory in another terminal before you're to able to successfully run `dfx deploy`

I would recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing node installations
