Not an IC related question more a Rust noob question.

I got a vulnerability detected and reported in a new canister I started developping but, don't know really how to track it down nor how to solve it. The issue does not seem to originate from my code but, from a crate I am using, so a bit lost how to find which one and what is vulnerable. How do I know which dependency has the issue? Any advice would be appreciated!

Dude, it's because my canister name is `telemetry`, and the security vulnerability was issued for a crate called ... `telemetry` üôà.

If I rename my canister, no issue.
