I've been using the new Orbis social network recently and it's really impressive. It's built using [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and it's shaping up to be a great place to meet and discuss web3 technologies. I just created a new group called ICP to discuss the Internet Computer. It strikes me that it could be a useful place for reaching out across the crypto divides to make the case for others to come and try it out. Please take a moment to sign up and join the new group!
