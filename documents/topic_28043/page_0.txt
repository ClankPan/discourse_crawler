Dfinity Neuron periodically has large Neurons go from dissolving to dissolved, and ICPs are transferred from these Neurons.
This is data extracted from the [vpgeek site](https://f2djv-5aaaa-aaaah-qdbea-cai.raw.icp0.io/feed)
The data circled in blue represents the maximum (98%) of ICP transfers from Dfinity's dissolved Neurons. If these data are correct, these are relatively large transfers.
What is the purpose of these transfers?I do not intend to pursue this question, but I am curious.
By the way, We know that the 4 remaining Dfinity Neurons that are dissolving, [including the 2 this month (4035, 18099889815598761901), will be completed in May](https://f2djv-5aaaa-aaaah-qdbea-cai.raw.icp0.io/dfinityNeurons?state=eyJwcm9wb3NhbFRvcGljRmlsdGVyIjoiZ292ZXJuYW5jZUFuZFNucyIsInNvcnRpbmciOlt7ImtleSI6ImRpc3NvbHZlRGVsYXkiLCJvcmRlciI6ImRlc2MifV0sImZpbHRlciI6W3sibmFtZSI6InN0YXRlIiwidmFsdWVzIjpbIkRpc3NvbHZpbmciXX1dLCJ0aW1lUGVyaW9kIjoibGFzdDMwRGF5cyIsInBpZUNoYXJ0c05ldXJvblR5cGUiOiJhbGwiLCJ1bnN0YWtlZElDUENoYXJ0TmV1cm9uVHlwZSI6ImFsbCJ9), and that the other Neurons are "not dissolving".

I think the 4xxx neurons were for the VCs, not the foundation.

According to [this list](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-voting-power/11801/2) 4001 through 4037 are controlled by the foundation. I don't have any info beyond that though...

Controlled, yeah, but as far as I know the disbursed ICP is sent to the VCs afterwards, hence the massive red candles around the 10th of each month over the past 2 years.

Lots of VCs these days can hardly read, let alone work a complex computational device.  Probably makes sense that their funds are secured by people who know what they're doing.
