Hey guys.

First time ICPer

Am logged into NNS and clicked on my the little profile-head top-right to try managing ID - It asks for my ID # but then pops up a QR code that needs to be scanned to login.

It appears that no other option to login exists on my iMac which is strange for desktop users. I am also quite surprised that you need to re-log when clicking this button in NNS.

Regardless, what is the workaround?  Am I missing something? Also I was sure that I already authorised my iphone as a secondary device but it won't login there either so that's why I wanted to login on my Mac and check.

Anyway, thoughts?

Simultaneously logged into NNS and unable to login to Internet Identity. I have my # and passkey on this computer but for some reason it wants QR even though its on the same ICP-passkeyed iMac as NNS is.

I'm not sure why this post was greyed out after I posted it - maybe it's cause it was my first post - not sure if anyone had the ability to actually reply but it was my first post so I probably missed something.

So I solved the problem. But only by avoiding two methods. It appears that accessing internet identity manager from the top-right of nns may be broken. Secondly, the login problem was with the iphone being added as a recovery device.

Solution 1: Once I removed the iphone as a recovery device and re-added my iPhone as a passkey instead it worked. Perhaps a passkey must be created before assigning it as a recovery device? - i'm not sure. So maybe now the iphone can be the recovery device?

Solution 2 - simple - just accessed internet identity with my mac from the main homepage and it worked instantly. For some reason if you access the internet identity from the top-right of nns, you cannot login.

Anyhoo, that's that. Perhaps someone else could test this and see if it is in fact broken atm.

Peace.
