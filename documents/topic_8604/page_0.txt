As the title says. 

By the way, did anyone get luck trying to implement stable memory collections for rust?

The IC's stable memory API is modelled after Wasm's memory model and is a stop gap measure until we can expose it directly as a proper memory inside Wasm (blocking on Wasm's long-due multi-memory proposal landing in the standard).

For a variety of reasons, Wasm does not currently support shrinking memory, although that keeps being discussed. It's a fairly tricky problem, though.
