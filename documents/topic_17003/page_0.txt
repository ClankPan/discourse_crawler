If someone makes a proposal and it is rejected by the community, how long do they have to wait before revising the proposal and re-submitting it? 
Thank you.

From a technical standpoint no delay is enforced AFAIK. From a social standpoint my suggestion would be I think once people had the chance to re-deliberate and a decent amount of people changed their opinions
