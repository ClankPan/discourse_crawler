# Community Statement on Constructive Dialogue

Dear Community Members,

By popular demand, we deleted a recent thread that was full of toxicity, personal attacks, conspiracy theories, and unhelpful discourse, driven by a handful of individuals.

Tl’dr, ICP community spaces should be safe places for positive and constructive discourse, rather than platforms where people aim to spread conspiracy theories about initiatives, and promote slurs and attacks against DFINITY, its team members, or other community members.

It has also come to our attention that some of the "concerned community members" involved, are really masquerading as ICP community members. Some are linked to adversaries who are seeking to harm the Internet Computer project for competitive reasons, and/or seeking to extract money through baseless lawsuits in America.

Regardless of what the underlying reasons for such behavior are, it has no place in ICP community spaces under our stewardship, and we shall seek to exclude it for the benefit of our wonderful broader community and the Internet Computer project as a whole.

With that in mind, we’ve made the decision to remove certain content that violated these principles.

## A better policy for everyone moving forward

The broader ICP community is amazing, and the ICP community, and projects that are the product of enormous work and effort, deserve much better. Therefore, going forward, we will aim to make ICP community spaces under our stewardship a gold standard for personal safety, constructive discourse, positive engagement, and rational discussion.

We have shifted policy to protect our community and project, we will actively seek to remove those standing in the way of creating spaces that establish this gold standard. We say to those promoting toxicity, you are not welcome, please leave.

## DFINITY initiatives and activities

DFINITY constantly aims to improve ICP technology, the Internet Computer ecosystem, and extend the reach of ICP technology to create network effects that benefit the ecosystem. These are our guiding principles.

Regarding the UTOPIA initiative, it is still in the early stages, but we will seek to answer questions with AMAs and means with appropriate timing. Needless to say, UTOPIA is just another initiative that continues our tireless pursuit of these principles and aims, which forms part of a battery of such initiatives, such as enabling the Internet Computer to run AI as smart contracts.

## Closing Thoughts

We wish to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone in the community that has provided so much support, we have your back. We’ll continue working to build out the Internet Computer network and ecosystem. Onwards and upwards.

Best Regards,

DFINITY Leadership Team
