Are there any working multisig wallets ready to be used on ICP?
I found [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icdevs-org-bounty-15-motoko-wallet-5-000/11282) about a bounty on this before. Is there a product out for this?

No one has sufficiently completed the bounty. It is on the list of things we need to do.
