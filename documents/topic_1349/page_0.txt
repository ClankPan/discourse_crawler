Hello community, I am a Monoko developer and now looking for a way of how to launch and maintain my own testnet or maybe mainet node
I'd like to setup my node and join it to a network
Do you know how to do it right now?

The requirements for setting up a node are currently quite high and probably not possible with consumer grade hardware/internet access. non the less this would be the form you would need to fill out
