# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires an x86-64 based machine, Ubuntu 20.04 or a newer version of the OS, Git, and Podman.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout 9c89622231301daf93528aa3b64b4d1ec4657680
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/9c89622231301daf93528aa3b64b4d1ec4657680/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/guestos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

@mrngilles @free @sat @nikola-milosa @Luka @pietrodimarco @dmanu 

As you probably recognize, @Zane has been performing a sanity check on the Release Notes of these Replica Version Management proposals for several months now.  I'd like to bring it to your attention that we now have two additional reviewers, @ZackDS and @cyberowl, who are also spending time on these sanity checks.  Will you and your teams at DFINITY please take a look at their reports that are documented in the CodeGov portal on DSCVR and let us know if you have any constructive feedback on our reviews.  I really appreciate how DFINITY is so professional about organizing these proposals and summarizing the Release Notes to enable reviews by the community.  If there is anything that stands out that we are doing well or needs improvement, then please feel free to let us know.  My goal is to achieve continuous improvement for the reviews performed by the CodeGov project.  It is important to note that we are not trying to audit the code in detail.  Our goal is to determine if the changes make sense and if there is anything unexpected or obviously incorrect that should be escalated.  To that end, this week @cyberowl identified an incorrect comment in one of the commits that you might want to double check.  It's a minor detail, but future developers may appreciate having the comment fixed.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of this replica update.

Proposal ID: **123784**
Neuron: CodeGov.org
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov portal on DSCVR](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566118/nns-proposal-123784) 
Voting history: [Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100&vh-topic=TOPIC_REPLICA_VERSION_MANAGEMENT)

At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period.  I encourage NNS voters to review the replica update proposal and vote manually.  Of course, you always have the choice to follow another person or another organization who is voting independently.  At this time, I am aware of [CodeGov.org](https://www.codegov.org/) neuron and [Taggr Network](https://taggr.top/#/realm/NNS-GOV) neuron who are performing this work, both of which are registered known neurons.
