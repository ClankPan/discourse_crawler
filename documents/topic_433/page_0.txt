You seem to have multiple `dfx.json` in that git. Could you start from scratch and avoid running `dfx new` or having multiple `dfx.json`?

Are you trying to run `dfx build` from the root of that git repository?

Your motoko code seems fine, but the project is embedded in the other so it might be you're not doing things from the right place.

Yes, go to the mtoko_babysteps folder, delete everything in there so itâ€™s empty, then just run this command once:

  dfx new hello_world

Try from there...
