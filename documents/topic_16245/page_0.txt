Hey everyone,

During my search to understand the arguments for and against an NNS treasury, Funded Contributors, and trying to solve funding problems for my own projects and others', a core question seems to be if there are legitimate uses of inflation of ICP by the NNS, outside of node operator and voting rewards, and even with an inflation cap. I ask for your voices to be heard in this Twitter poll on the matter:

If you have more thoughts you'd like to share here, please do.

IMO, not a good time to ask investors to give up some of their rewards. I would formulate this question (together with the NNS Treasury idea) once we are in a more comfortable situations.
