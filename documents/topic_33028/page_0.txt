### TL;DR:

* Just launched: Roshambo, a rock scissor paper game part of Dragon Eyes platform
* It's available on [https://icp.dragoneyes.xyz/roshambo](https://icp.dragoneyes.xyz/roshambo)
* You can bet from 0.1, 1 or 5 ICP with 50:50 chance to double your money if you win.

### Background
Starting from a [simple dice game](https://icp.dragoneyes.xyz/dice) (with a twist), Dragon Eyes generates $200K++ in revenue in the first few months in ICP, which mostly distributed back as reward to the players.

We also have the Arbitrum version of Dice using SIWE (Sign in With Ethereum) [available here.](https://arb.dragoneyes.xyz)

It's an immediate Product/Market Fit and we double down by building more casual games and going multichain, and will be launching in Base (EVM L2) & Telegram with the business layer in ICP.

The goal is eventually a fully decentralized gam(bl)ing platform where the profit of the house is streamed back to the players via the native token after TGE.

Play against an onchain randomizer with provably fair 50:50 chance to win in this classic game.

* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beat Paper
* Paper beats Rock

If you win, you double your ICP. If you lose, well-- you lose your iCP. 
But whether you win or lose, you will get $EYES, the reward token of Dragon Eyes ecosystem that works like points for allocation on the native token airdrop after TGE.

### Connect & Top Up
1. Connect wallet
Login using Google. If this is the first time, a new ICP wallet will be generated for you and will be paired with your google account.
2. Top up ICP to this wallet
 Transfer ICP from your existing wallet or use your favorite CEX to withdraw some ICP to this wallet address.

### How to Play
1. Pick Bet Size
2. Hold Rock / Paper / Scissor to Shoot
3. Now you're playing!

## Roadmap
We'll be releasing for more casual games and going multichain. Please find our roadmap here: [Dragon Eyes Roadmap 2024](https://dragoneyes.notion.site/Dragon-Eyes-Roadmap-2024-a2b77980d4ba455998f4e650e5181a7d)

Pretty cool app. I have been enjoying it so far.  What other games do you plan to add?

-------------------------

Thanks!

In less than three days, we got over 1,000 rounds played, with more than 400 ICP bet.

The next phase is increasing our user base by enabling the $EYES version of every game we have. We will have our marketing engine run after we launch on other chains, while the business layer stays on the IC.

Probably this will be the one of the first successful cases of mass adoption for chain fusion ;)

FWIW,
The ICP community is small, and the goal of releasing the ICP frontend version first is to get feedback quickly and iterate faster. In a few hours, we already got some data and iterated some parts of the game.

There will be a version of the game with higher stakes; the reward is 20x when you win 3x in a row. üòä

All of our games are casual and mobile-first. In our pipeline, we‚Äôll release:

* Variable Spin (a la YoloGames)
* EyeRoll (a version of Wheel of Fortune, but fancier & better)
* Solitaire (bet on your skill to rearrange the deck)

-------------------------

### Updates

* 3,5K++ rounds played in less than 1 week with no marketing budget
* 2000++ ICP in transaction, with 660+ ICP rewards already paid to users (win/draw/lose chance is equally 1/3)
* cut "shoot time" by 30% so instead of 20s each shoot is around 10-15s
* Did we mention that we're burning cycles each round played by users?

### Next
- Launch EVM & BTC version using SIWE & SIWB
- Launch Roshambo Streak -- you can 20x your ICP if winning 3x in a row
- Launch EYEROLL -- this is the game for free users' first funnel available multichain so they don't need to have ICP to play the game

If you're talking and whining about the lack of mass adoption and Product/Market Fit on ICP tech -- well, we probably have the solution..
