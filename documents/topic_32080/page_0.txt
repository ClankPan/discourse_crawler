Trax don’t have a community and never respond to investors after it’s launch. Trax DAO have my funds lockup in their SNS and no one is available for questioning and clarification. No updates and correspondence with Investors.

I think Trax is one of the projects that discredits DAOnism on ICP.

I propose more scrutiny into DAOnism. Cos, IC blockchain is blamed for inefficient status of some of these DAOs.

Why should I burn my valuable 10 ICP token for any new project like WaterNeuron? Because I am a fish? How different is Water Neuron from Trax DAO or any other new SNS on IC?

Trax is giving a bad vibes to SNS launches. Until TRAX DAO is unDAOed or until TRAX DAO pay some respect to their Investors, Don’t invest in any new SNS launch DYOR, they are all Trax. 
#dontgetittwisted blame my outburst on Trax DAO cos they have my funds lockedup and they don’t respect investors.

This is a one man’s demonstration against Trax DAO (Trash DAO)

Take Trax down from DAO status. They don’t deserve it and I regret participating in the Swap.
