You can find out the controllers of a canister by searching for the canister at https://icscan.io/canister, or by using an agent, calling the `readState` API, and then parsing the values stored in a tree in the certificate. Agent JS has a [CanisterStatus](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.ic0.app/agent/modules/CanisterStatus.html) API to make this easy.

There is no way to find canisters controlled by a principal, however

You can also search for the canister ID on the [IC dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canisters) to see its controllers.

Iâ€™ll throw another one in the mix ; ) you can search any canister id here: [https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/)

Best way to find the controller from your console is

dfx canister --network ic info <canistername>
