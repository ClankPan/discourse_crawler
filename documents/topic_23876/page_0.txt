Recently I got an airdrop to a wallet tied to Sonic, I used Internet Identity to login into my sonic.
But sonic itself doesn't support NFT.
I can see my NFT on nft geek but have no way to access it.

Is there any way to connect 3rd party wallet to an II app's tied wallet

I have the same problem with my NNS wallet itself. NFTs are trapped and I can't get it out.
