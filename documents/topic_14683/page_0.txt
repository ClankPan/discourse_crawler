I'm currently working on an application on the IC (experimental MVP so far only). Besides that, I spend quite some time reading up on contract theory trying to understand what the IC will allow us to build in terms of new incentive structures.

It would be nice to know more people personally from the ecosystem. If someone's up to having a chat, let me know.
