Hello!

Is the dfx installer supposed to install `moc` as well? It's not doing that on my linux laptop :stuck_out_tongue: 

In any case, how do I install `moc` and the base libraries on a linux laptop (Fedora 36)?

Yes, the install script should download a lot of utilities. As of dfx 0.11.2 the full list should look like this:
```bash
‚ùØ ls $(dfx cache show) 
base				        libgmp.10.dylib
canister_sandbox		    libsecp256k1.0.dylib
dfx				            libz.1.2.12.dylib
ic-btc-adapter		     	mo-doc
ic-canister-http-adapter	mo-ide
ic-ref				        moc
ic-starter			        replica
icx-proxy			        sandbox_launcher
libffi.8.dylib
```
BUT the install script does not add this directory to `$PATH`, so `moc` won't be accessible through she command line. If you want it in your path, you'll have to do that on your own, but I'd recommend you add `$(dfx cache show)` so you get the latest one when you upgrade dfx.

hmm .. that's weird:

```
$ dfx cache show
/home/user/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.11.2
$ ls /home/user/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.11.2
ls: cannot access '/home/user/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.11.2': No such file or directory
```

it merely installs `dfx` under (my pre-existing) `$HOME/bin` directory.

Ah, right, I forgot: It's not the install script that fills the cache but dfx once it runs certain operations. `dfx new` does the trick.

Aaaaaaaaaaah, okay, that's a bit "unusual" :stuck_out_tongue:

You could also run `dfx cache install` after upgrading to populate that directory ; )
