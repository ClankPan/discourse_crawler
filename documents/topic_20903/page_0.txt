# What is happening?

The boundary nodes are being updated with some potentially breaking changes to address security vulnerabilities:

1. `/api` calls will only be allowed on the base domains:
   * `icp-api.io`
   * `ic0.app`
   * `icp0.io`
2. Calls to /_/raw will require certification
3. requests by crawlers for SEO will require certification

Since some changes are potentially breaking we will do the rollout in stages giving you the opportunity to test your dapps before the changes are rolled out to production.

# Change details

## `/api` calls

Boundary nodes receive `/api` requests to domains like:

* `mainnet.dfinity.network`
* `boundary.ic0.app`
* `<canister_id>.ic0.app`

For more details see the [https interface spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#http-interface).

In order to fix a security vulnerability, the /api/ calls will only be allowed on the base domains:

* `icp-api.io`
* `ic0.app`
* `icp0.io`

**What does it mean?**

In the first phase, `/api` requests to a hostname other than the base domains will be redirected to `icp-api.io`.

For example:

`boundary.ic0.app/api/v2/<canister_id>/query` will be redirected to `icp-api.io/api/v2/<canister_id>/query`. In the second phase, `/api` requests are only allowed on the base domains.

Recent versions of agent-js and agent-rs already rewrite `/api/*` requests to subdomains of the base domains to the base domain itself. (e.g., `<canister_id>.ic0.app` → `ic0.app`) and no changes are required.

**Who is affected?**

If you are using older libraries or have implemented your own you might have `/api` requests going to other hostnames, those requests will get redirected and eventually rejected. If you use newer libraries, this will not affect you.

# Timeline

**Thursday June 22nd** - We have reserved 1 boundary node at [2604:6800:258:1:5000:98ff:fe7d:347b], [162.247.129.233] with the updated configuration. You can use dnsmasq or configure your /etc/hosts file (or windows equivalent) to point to it if you want to test your application. Note that you will need to point the following URLs (possibly more if you are using custom domains):

* `icp0.app`
* `<canister_id>.ic0.app`
* `icp0.io`
* `<canister_id>.icp0.io`
* `icp-api.io`

During this period, that preview boundary node will track the regular boundary node releases. ie if there is a production deployment during this time, this particular boundary node will be patched and upgraded at the same time.

**Wednesday July 5th 5pm UTC** - For a duration of 24 hours we will update the production boundary nodes to accept `/api` requests only on the base domain names. `/api` requests to other hostnames will be redirected. After the 24 hours have elapsed we will rollback the changes. The idea is to rollback faster in case of widespread outage and to give you time to push fixes before we make the changes permanent.

**Wednesday July 12th at 5pm UTC** - For a duration of 24 hours we will update the production boundary nodes to accept `/api` requests only on the base domain names. `/api` requests to other hostnames will be redirected. After the 24 hours have elapsed we will rollback the changes. The idea is to rollback faster in case of widespread outage and to give you time to push fixes before we make the changes permanent.

**Wednesday July 19th at 5pm UTC** - Production boundary nodes will only serve `/api` requests on the base domain names hostname, and redirect `/api` requests received for other hostnames.

**Wednesday July 26th at 5pm UTC** - Boundary nodes will stop accepting `/api` requests to hostnames other than the base domain names.

Please use this forum thread to reach out with any questions or issues you encounter.

[/quote]


Hello. Can you please clarify what this will mean for canisters that host assets that aren’t certified? For example, most NFT canisters allow for viewing of NFT images through <canister_id>.raw.ic0.app. Will that still be possible after this change is implemented?

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-06-22 23:17:13 UTC | #3

Hi @LightningLad91 -

First some context:

`/_/raw/` and `<canisterid>.raw.ic0.app` are different things:

* `/_/raw` is a special path used by some projects to serve a dapp specific service worker 
* `<canisterid>.raw.ic0.app` is a way to get the decoded http response directly from the boundary node.

As far as `<canisterid>.raw.ic0.app` - we don't expect that behavior to change. You can verify it for yourself by setting an entry like this in your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
# replace <canisterid> with your actual canister id
162.247.129.233     <canisterid>.raw.ic0.app
````

And the behavior should remain the same.

LightningLad91 | 2023-06-22 23:18:32 UTC | #4

Thank you. Really appreciate the explanation and I am relieved that those collections will keep working.

Hi, could you clarify that what should we do with the third one "requests by crawlers for SEO will require certification"? What changes do we have to make with the SEO crawlers?

Will this affect us if we are using an Alternate(fork) of icxproxy?

Would be nice to know what we need to be at in order to ensure there is no breaking change in our code

[/quote]

I would suggest using at least: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/releases/tag/v0.15.4 

However, looking at the code it looks the rewrite from *.ic0.app to ic0.app has been in agent-js since this commit: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/commit/7b4333fd1462bb36009b7c59df5cff0ef3e24587 which is quite a while ago (Dec 2021)

Thanks @raymondk! This seems to translate to v0.10.3

It's hard for me to say without knowing exactly how you are using your fork of icx-proxy.
The most important part IMO is that you are making /api requests to one of the base domains. For example you shouldn't be making /api calls to `<canisterid>.ic0.app` or `boundary.dfinity.network`

Hope that answers your question - but I'm happy to discuss it live if you want to go into your specific use case.

hi @cyaolong -

For some context - search engine crawlers go through a special path where they will use icx-proxy on the boundary node to translate api responses into HTML - very similar to how you would be accessing resource over raw (ie canisterid.raw.ic0.app)

In general:
* if you are using raw and that's all you care about, nothing should change for you.
* if you are using the regular endpoint and you do not have a custom service worker then your assets are already being certified and you should be good to go.

Folks who might run into issues are likely to be those who are using a custom service worker that doesn't enforce certification.

Hope that helps

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-06-26 13:19:15 UTC | #15

Our fork is here:  https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/icx-proxy/ the basic usage is in the readme.

Looks like we are passing in the replica uri upon config:  https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/icx-proxy/blob/f6bdce44189a56c9a33d071b41049d2d06e78b34/src/main.rs#L552

Looks like we are using in the setup.  Sounds like we need to update that?

```
https://ic0.app
```

in

```
icx-proxy --replica "https://ic0.app" --redis-url "redis://tf-icx-proxy-redis-cluster-dev-us-east-1.tvmdlr.ng.0001.use1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379" --phonebook-id "ngrpb-5qaaa-aaaaj-adz7a-cai"
```

rbirkner | 2023-06-26 14:14:51 UTC | #16

Hi @skilesare 

Yes, you should use one of the three base domains. Ideally, you use `icp-api.io` as it is dedicated to the API endpoints, whereas the others also serve "browser requests" (i.e., the service worker). Due to that, `icp-api.io` is less likely to be added to a domain blocklist like the one of Spamhaus.

I've noticed refreshing any page on my dapp with a URL that has a path after the apps entry point is now simply failing, I've noticed the same when refreshing my browser after a search on Kinic, here's my error (I presume the route after the base domain is the problem here):

Timestamp: Tue, 27 Jun 2023 14:29:01 GMT

Request: {
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "https://6t32g-3yaaa-aaaao-ai56a-cai.icp0.io/dashboard",
  "origin": "https://6t32g-3yaaa-aaaao-ai56a-cai.icp0.io"
}

Response: {
  "status": 500,
  "statusText": "Response verification failed",
  "body": "Response verification failed"
}

Unless I haven't understood correctly does this mean we can no longer reload specific pages on our dapp without the base address as our entry point? Navigation through my dapp works without problem but reloading assets for a specific page fails...

@Fortaite this is related to a different issue:

the request
```
icp-api.io

will there be any difference

I request ic0.app when staking neurons
Initiate manage_neuron's

```
claim_or_refresh_arg = ManageNeuron {

Hello folks! Reminder that tomorrow (July 5th) we will be doing our 24h production test at 5pm UTC.
Please use this thread to report errors if you encounter any.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-05 18:15:57 UTC | #25

Hi folks - this is an update to let you know that the boundary nodes have been updated for the 24h period.

If you run into any issues please let us know in this thread.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-07-05 18:30:14 UTC | #26

Not sure if it is related. Sometimes I get this, sometimes I don't. I think it's related to Internet Identity. I repeatedly logout and login and it fixes or breaks.

raymondk | 2023-07-05 21:40:56 UTC | #28

Hello there - some community members noticed issues affecting their production apps. We're cutting the test short and rolling back the boundary nodes to the previous version.
I'll update this thread when the rollback is done.

Based on the results of this experiment, we might adjust the rollout plan and will keep you updated in this thread.

-------------------------

FranHefner | 2023-07-05 21:55:52 UTC | #29

I had problems with some origyn features ( https://governance.origyn.network/#/stakes) Also, I already spoke with @skilesare , I thank him for his time! they will fix it soon!

--
ADD: Now it works!

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-05 22:50:33 UTC | #30

Rollback is complete.

For those who want to test - the host at [2604:6800:258:1:5000:98ff:fe7d:347b], [162.247.129.233] has the future configuration and is still available for you to test.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-08 00:44:58 UTC | #31

Hello folks - please note that we've adjusted the timeline in response to the issues from the production test on July 5th.

Essentially we're pushing full production rollout by a week - we'll use July 12th to run another 24h test and give folks a chance to validate their fixes from this week.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-12 17:29:01 UTC | #32

Hello everyone - the rollout for the 24h test is starting now - please notify us in this thread if you run into any issues.

This is happening on the Origyn Dashboard.  It is a bit of a lift to re-bootstrap our ci/cd at the moment and (teaser) we are hoping to have a brand new dapp running on the IC out as soon as Monday....so we're just going to ride this test out and push to have the new dapp out before this goes live.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-13 14:40:33 UTC | #35

@skilesare @FranHefner I'm going to start rolling back shortly.

Note that eventually /api requests to any domain that is not strictly to the base domains will be rejected.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-19 20:09:48 UTC | #36

Hi folks - we deployed a canary of this today and expect to do a full production rollout tomorrow.
Please reply here if you run into any problems.

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-28 13:28:08 UTC | #37

Hello everyone and thanks for putting up with all the changes.
We're at the last phase (which was supposed to be for july 26th) were we are planning to disable the redirects.

We've delayed the change a little bit because there are some 80k requests per hour going to `boundary.ic0.app` that will break when we disable redirects. They seem to be coming mostly from the same machines which look like they're pulling transaction information.

We're trying to identify the source of the requests to give them a warning in case they've missed the thread.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-07-28 16:28:27 UTC | #38

We found that this was messing with our Rosetta API(thanks @bitbruce ).  We've notified the two exchanges that run their own rosetta nodes pointing to the OGY ledger, but haven't heard much back from them. I'll follow up...perhaps there are others running rosetta nodes against ICP?

-------------------------

raymondk | 2023-07-28 18:53:11 UTC | #39

Normally the rosetta endpoints should not have been affected by this change.
Do you know exactly what is broken?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-07-28 21:13:48 UTC | #40

![image|690x116](upload://uOq4WNQ8YeKMLk72M9CCh4yhTzD.png)

We changed our config to use [icp-api.io](http://icp-api.io/) and the errors went away.
