Can we query ckBTC ledger canister using http_request as well? 
I am asking this because I can clearly see ledger canister has http_request method in it here : https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai 

But I cant find any documentation or codebase, where I can see http methods like to query balance etc directly from ledger canister instead of calling icrc1_balance from another canister and then exposing that other canister method to a http GET request.

No that I know.

According code, the `http_request` on ICRC1 ledger canister is used to provide metrics and logs.
