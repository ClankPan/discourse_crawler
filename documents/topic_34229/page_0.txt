Hi! I'm working on an node + express API to consume ckBtc minter and ledger canister provided in IC documentation. I create a complete flow for deposit, convert to ckbtc, transfer to external wallets in ckbtc addresses. 

Everything works fine but I have a question in the retrieve method. The candid flow explanations mentions that the method "to" address is obtained in the method `get_withdrawal_account` and then deposit ckbtc to that address.

My doubt is placed here. I supposed to transfer with for example `icrc1_transfer` to that address, and then call `retrieve_btc`with the BTC address to deposit the amount? 

Thanks for helping and I would try it but minimum amount is too expensive to that. I can't risk 0.001 BTC to make a shoot on this.

I believe that you are following the previous flow.

There is a new flow which you can find in detail [here under the Converting ckBTC to BTC section](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Chain-key_Bitcoin).

From a high-level, you have to:
1. Call `icrc2_approve` with the account that you want to take ckBTC from on the ckBTC ledger to allow the ckBTC ledger to take ckBTC away

2. Call `retrieve_btc_with_approval` with the same account above specifying the BTC amount and BTC address

I Resolved it with the common transfer without approval. I was able to do it! I have now an issue with notify my users. Can I send you a message?

I am assuming that you went with the older method? Yes, feel free to provide more info.

Well I didn't found where to send you a private message, so I tell you here:

In my API I need to add something like a webhook, to call to the wallet backend to notify users when they receive a transfer. There's anyway to do that? I was searching info and only found the `get_events` method but it will have so many troubles to implement. 

I have not a custom canister, I am using ckBtc Minter and Ledger and creating an address from unique value (username) and uuid. I need to know the exact time they receive a deposit to notify them.

If you could help me with this, I will be gratefull to you the rest of my life. üôåüèª
