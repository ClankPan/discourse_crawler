@dominicwilliams When the proposal officially comes out, What is the proposed verdict on 8yr neurons being able to add new ICP to their stake? Are we able to add newly purchased ICP? Can we autostake our maturity? Will we be able to choose to turn on and off autostake maturity at will? Thanks!

I wouldn't levy such a heavy accusation considering Fabio literally mentions that he takes no money from anyone in most of his videos. Sure, many influencers take money, and often do this by simply remaining silent and not disclosing. The difference between remaining silent and outright lying about it could probably amount to a difference between deceptive advertising and actual fraud. Considering how he has a legal background, and a relatively small channel, it would logically follow that it would not be in his interest to do this. I believe in conspiracy theories, but this makes no sense.

EDIT: I removed the R-word

Thanks Diego for the insightful words as usual.


Yes the forums is very clean, so clean that its almost too good to be true :) 


You should be compensated for your excellent work by DFINITY. They should employ you and pay you a good salary :) 


I think there should be a third option of not making any changes to the tokenomics so casually every now and then. Maybe we should focus on adoption and user onboarding instead of tweaking tokenomics to move the price.

Can someone explain to me what would make sense to leave the old neurons set to 8 years if they would still generate the same rewards as 5-year-old neurons? this is nonsense. why maintain a neuron with an 8-year dissolv period, incurring greater risk and reaping proportionately less profit. apr for 6 months - 1 year is disproportionately high for people who have been investing for 5 or 8 years. Reducing inflation WILL NOT DRIVE DEMAND AND WILL NOT IN ITSELF LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN PRICES. APR modifications that hit the hardest at people staking for a very long term / real investors are suicidal - good luck after losing your most important legion. All changes in staking should result in the release of all neurons and only then would everyone decide again whether they want to continue staking under the new rules, only such a solution is fair. if it is different, next year we will reduce the maximum staking to 3 or 4 years, then maybe to 2 years there will be a cut in APR parallel, which will do NOTHING anyway because reduced inflation (which is not high) will not increase the price, it may help, but the ICP is too young / too small to bring the expected effect. Without good momentum, investors will leave - after all, they (the sensible ones) don't sell their rewards at ridiculously low prices. The apr for neurons should range from 3 to 5% up to a year and grow exponentially, not linearly, up to 8 years - I think it would make sense. I have the impression that this idea wants at all costs to raise the short-term price of ICP for a group of early investors at the expense of us, so that they can dump their tokens - and ultimately abandon the project in a year, when the stage of releasing tokens for them ends, or after the liquidity is exhausted. I hope that we will be able to defend icp against ..this idea and this proposal will be rejected or accepted in the form I described. second proposition - if someone helps someone with taxes by raising mutirity on ICP, I have nothing against it.

reminiscence | 2024-05-10 10:29:25 UTC | #461

It's a good point. I feel somehow fooled if the before promised reward function is changed without me having the possibility to cancel my commitment. I did stake because I thoroughly calculated the risks/rewards. This proposal would completely change that. It feels like a contract that is changed without my explicit consent.

It's important that the community decides about the inflation but every individual must be able to decide whether they still are willing to commit or not if one of the proposals gets an approval.

I was going to say the exact same.  I am 8 years gang since June 2021.  
Remember the maturity stuff to have the bodies to save taxes (wich will not to me, matter of time)?
And then, end of summer or fall 2022, the discussion, including @Kyle_Langham from Dfinity supporting to completely eliminating the rewards to save the network, but let the seed investors continuing dumping every month because, apparently, they deserved it.
This is how I feel too, for 3 years now.  Those early investors seems to have tons of undercover power, still.
They just finished, today in fact, to have their neurons released, except a very small part for the next 12 months.
Those proposals always come from the same person and the timing is just insane.

But I do not blame anybody. Only myself.  I should not be here.  My responsibility to have believed everything they said and everything they were promoting.

To be fair though, I still believe in the network itself.  Being a very experimented developper in Web2, I think it is amazing.  But I also think they abuse financially and they are not finished yet, seems like.  Only my thaughts though.

Went from 99% lost to now 50% lost.  Thanks for receiving rewards and have DCA to only 50% lost.
But, yes, sure, would sell you the price I paid.  My average is 25$ now.  Deal?
If no deal, need to DCA more to get even.   Even after 3-4 years is not the best investment, do you agree?

Have 88,000 to sell at 25$.  Are you up?

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-10 12:38:11 UTC | #465

Unfortunately what you paid is irrelevant.  Price is under $13 and if you want out so badly you get to sell at a discount not a premium. Feel free to go ahead and put it on the marketplace then you can at least get some offers.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-10 14:36:29 UTC | #466

Thank you Erik for this conversation.  You are right and you made me change my mind.  If this proposal come to a vote, I will vote YES.
Why?  Because you are right to say that I want get out. (But not stupid enough to get out at 50% lost)

So, instead of restaking all rewards in my 8 years neurons as I do right now to DCA, I would lower my years to 5, unlock, sell all my rewards during 4 years and 9 months (remember Dom would change to minimum 3 months instead of 6 for rewards)
And get all my bag available in 5 years hoping the price will be over 20$.  5 years is not too bad. Already been 3 years. Would make 8 total, enough for me. Price came from hundreds to 12$ in the first 3 years but I am confident it may reverse and go the other way somehow.

This last hope to have the price at 20$ is certainly my main concern though.  
1- As of now, 40 millions ICP will come on the market in the next 5 years, not counting the rewards to come. 
2- Risk that more 8 years stakers do like me and we all get our bag available for sale at the same time in 5 years.

Maybe Dom would think to a mechanism where not all these 5 years unlock becomes available at the same time?  
Maybe I will be the only one to do this... hopefully.

I will take the risk as it is the only chance I have to have a decent way out. As you can see, I am not a greedy person.

Thanks Erik.  I seriously appreciate your comments.  Make me think and plan and maybe other members on this forum too.

EDIT: Obviously, Dom have some doubt about the future of the price too.  If not, he would not do such a proposal.

I don't get why you think a big sell out will happen in 5 years. From your image it is clear that 23 millions are dissolving the coming here alone. In 5 years most of the sells (if it will happen is questionable) are already over. If you're right your strategy won't help.

If the ICP price will constantly decrease due to inflation, the reward received does not matter. If the rewards are cut and the ICP turns into a deflationary structure and the ICP prices rise as a result, I think this is a better outcome than receiving a reward.

[/quote]

This measure **does not guarantee** that inflation will decrease in the long run, so 8-year neurons will be negatively affected.

-------------------------

osman | 2024-05-10 18:50:45 UTC | #471

Currently, almost all of the approximately 500,000 ICP printed extra monthly is distributed as rewards. This measure guarantees that inflation will fall significantly, but it does not guarantee that a deflationary period will occur. It is certain that ICPs distributed as rewards create inflation. Inflation also puts downward pressure on the price of ICP. If inflation is not created under the name of the reward mechanism and no additional ICP payments are made to idle capacities at the nodes, a deflationary ICP is an achievable target.

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2024-05-10 19:33:42 UTC | #472

The main sell pressure comes from the seed investor token unlocks (3.23 millions). There is a statistic that half of the unlocks gets staked in average. So lets say 1.615 millions get sold.


Now voting rewards: Around half of voting rewards are restacked. This means remain 250k each month get sold. The proposal would reduce the inflation at around 20%, meaning 50k less each month. 
So current sell pressure: 1615k + 250k = 1865k
Sell pressure with proposal: 1865k-50k= 1815k

Do you really think a change of 50k/1865k=2.6% of sell pressure has any significant impact on price?

kmanxhuka | 2024-05-10 23:01:53 UTC | #473

Hi! I've been following this topic closely since the beginning, and I'm a big supporter of ICP, with many 8-year neurons. I don't plan to back out unless things change dramatically. 
It's comforting to see many others who believe in the project like I do.

When I first read @dominicwilliams proposal, it worried me. How could such a big project be so fragile, especially when its biggest supporters could be affected so much?

I think there should be a rule that tokenomic proposals need more than 60% YES votes to pass. People's money is on the line, so we need to take these decisions seriously.

When someone mentioned that the existing 8-year neurons shouldn't be touched, I thought "that's fine, as long as my neurons stay in tact (along with its rewards)", but then it came to my mind that this wouldn't be fair to those who find out about ICP later on, and want to be ICP Maxis like me, which would not encourage them to join the project. Let the 8yeargang grow, who, as I've seen, are the best ambassadors for onboarding new members into ICP.

Regarding selling pressure, it's the market doing it's thing. Every project is on selling pressure these days. Let it have it's way. When the bulls come, things will change. Looking at the charts, you'll see that the most selling pressure occurs when VC neurons get dissolved. The rewards of staked neurons are not the ones who contribute to this huge pressure. And also, I don't know why Dominic is so obsessed with the selling pressure, which leads him to do proposals like this (see maturity modulation proposal purposes). There should be liquidity on the market, let the market decide the value of the coin. We should do our job by improving the infrastructure of the protocol, marketing the capabilities of it and teaching people the benefits of using ICP; and not waste our time trying to manipulate the market by decreasing selling pressure.

**Me and others who support my neuron will vote against the first proposal if it involves changing tokenomics that could scare away long-term supporters.**

-------------------------

let4be | 2024-05-11 16:55:57 UTC | #474

Thinking more about it - I fully support you, I as well will be voting against any variation of the 1st proposal
Current tokenomics works perfectly fine, we shouldn't create unnecessary division and disarray in the community. It's likely to have a contrary effect on selling pressure and project success in general.

What we should focus on - is building, especially in the DeFi area.
This is what trully matters - get ICP good DeFi, stablecoins, multiple CEX exposure for good projects that are building on ICP and see it fly against all selling pressure

-------------------------

osman | 2024-05-12 00:36:18 UTC | #475

The work of the Definity team to reduce inflation by reducing the amount of tokens compulsorily minted until the protocol can finance itself with its revenues made me hopeful.
All stakers need to understand this first: Rewards paid with high interest rates ultimately cause inflation by increasing the amount of ICP we hold. This inflation also puts downward pressure on ICP prices in the spot market. While high rewards increase the number of tokens we have, they cause serious harm to all of us by pushing down the token prices in the market. ICP awards are meaningful when they give them with real income. Because the rewards to be given with real income will not be made by printing and distributing tokens, but by purchasing tokens from the spot market and distributing them to stakers, it will not cause inflation.
I absolutely support any decision to prevent inflation. If it is possible;
up to 1 year
 Rate of rewards paid to stakers =Let the previous month's inflation rate be put to vote as +0,5%.
up to 5 year
Rate of rewards paid to stakers =Let the previous month's inflation rate be put to vote as +1%.
up to 8 year
Rate of rewards paid to stakers =Let the previous month's inflation rate be put to vote as +1,5%.
 In other words, as inflation decreases, reward rates should also decrease.
(I find it useful to remind you. I am also a staker)

coteclaude | 2024-05-12 01:48:11 UTC | #476

Your theory and all theories I have read here are making sense.  What does not make any sense is the 3 years tokenomics history so far.
While the token went from 100's of $ down to 2.87, Dfinity was defending their tokenomics.  While in the worst period, they got a thread with analysis and graph showing the burn would surpass the nodes and governance rewards combined in 4-5 years.  There was not a single mention that governance rewards inflation was a problem.
Since then, within the exact same tokenomics, the ICP price went from 2.87 to the 12's $ in 6 months and while still early VCs dumping monthly.  Suddenly, now, there is an inflation problems.
I think there is more, much more to the story that we all don't know.
It's almost impossible that Dfinity (Dominic) are just waking up to the tokenomics, after 3 years of price nightmare, and just realize there is an inflation problem.  They are way too smart people.

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2024-05-12 09:00:25 UTC | #477

My vote decision will be based solely on data and not conjectures. Currently I see more disadvantages than advantages and it wouldn't affect price for the next coming years. So my answer currently is no.

If the proposal is created by some other reasons, it's up to dfinity to be transparent in order to win my and other votes. It's simple as that.

-------------------------

viva | 2024-05-12 10:42:02 UTC | #479

The higher the currency price, the more cycles that ICP can exchange, and the DAPP will actually burn less ICP, the higher the currency price, the more serious this problem is, according to the current deflation and inflation mechanism, I personally think this is the case. I hope that the real elite will take these issues into account, and as a non-professional, I may not be able to consider many issues in an incomplete way or even wrong. According to the experience of many countries, elite governance and mass participation can develop better, just like the Senate and House of Representatives in the United States, and I think it is similar to the governance of IC. Because sometimes the knowledge and vision of ordinary people are insufficient.

-------------------------

frederico02 | 2024-05-12 11:33:51 UTC | #480

Lets get some charts and data from a simulation on both proposals. I think that is the clearest way to settle the argument. We can debate about the finer points all we like but without some analytics on the proposals this will go nowhere.

-------------------------

RobertoClaudio | 2024-05-13 03:55:33 UTC | #481

ICP inflation is high but has been falling since the token was launched. Right now, it's around 7% per year.

For all intents and purposes, we must consider maturity equal to ICP.

Free Maturity can be converted into ICP with a delay of 10 days.
Stake maturity provides the same voting power and rewards as ICP.

Below is a spreadsheet with historical inflations for 6 and 12 months.

I think the rate of decline in inflation is very slow (only 10%/year).

Dominic's updated proposal appears to be conducive to the healthy growth of the ICP ecosystem.

Small changes to token economics cannot balance the opinions of all parties, and I think only a redesign of token economics can be reversed, such as stICP, no longer have staked years, inflation is designed at 3%, and more Dapps are enabled through Restaking.

This is precisely my question as well.

Why is it that the tokenomics was great when launching the token at 100s of $, and now it is not? 

What has changed?

Since this supposedly was not a rug-pull, there must have been a reason for launching the token at hundreds of dollars, right? 

What am I missing here?

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2024-05-14 02:38:26 UTC | #485

You are confused. I believe Dfinity was defending the “death spiral” as it related to the lower the ICP price the higher the node provider rewards. As the case is the higher the ICP price the less ICP is paid to the node operators. As was the case, the cyclical nature of the market has corrected and there is no death spiral, just FUD. 
As you want to spread more FUD, or you just must be confused again, ICP inflation is Not a problem as you stated. It appears Dominic made a forum post and proposed a tweak to “make it better” and reduce it. If we do nothing that is fine too, why you might ask, because inflation is not a problem. 
The likely culprit here is your FUD posts and misinterpretations and general negative sentiment. It is very clear to see.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-14 07:50:47 UTC | #486

Call me Fudder as much as you want if this make you feel good.
Here is the reality, not FUD.

With the new numbers, with the new proposal and when the rewards will be at 5% of the supply.  Calculated with same numbers of voters and stakers as of today.
5 years: 6.78% 
1 year: 3.57%

Now make your own conclusion if these new numbers will attrack new stakers.

I could be wrong but I taught the goal was to have as many stakers as possible.  Please let me know if this has changed, or if I got that wrong from the beginning.

This is reality, real numbers, not FUD.  

In order to vote the right way, as they wish will be right, voters need to be informed rightly.

I can be a little off, but not by much.

EDIT: actual 8 years are offered to stay at same level for their current neuron.  Only new stakers would be affected.
Actual stakers will not be able to re-stake new rewards at old rate.  New lower rate will apply. So good chance new rewards for actual stakers will not be stake at those low rates.

-------------------------

JMVR | 2024-05-14 14:32:01 UTC | #487

The launching price was due pair to the FTX perpetual future inflated before the launching date. Dont know what was the exact price Dfinity wanted to launch the token. Anyone knows ?

a few months ago when icp was at 2.90 and people was talking about icp going to less thanna dollar and probably crashing down to 0 because of the death spiral, which it ended up being FUd and nonsense, i wtote a comment on X when i was taking to another user and i was trying to explain to him why everybody stacking for 8 years was bad for the project because it was creating way too many tokensand therefore that will drive the price down

let's be fair
we are all here to make money
but we have to be fair and try to find mutual ground and meet in the middle, here is the deal

dfinity has to inpose a balance that is good and beneficial for both, the users meaning the investors but they also have to think about their project or network

i think the proposal is beneficial and fair but we have greedy people that only care about themselves even if they have to destroy the project in their quest for wealth

i will completely understand if dfinity will change previous agreements but they are not doing that, they ate giving you the option if you want to
lower your neuron from 8 to 5 years, they are only proposing the 5 year neuron limit on the new neurons that willbe created after the proposal is accepted if it passed

people act like they can't add another 3 or 4 years if they really want to, i think stacking for a bit less is better because you can always increase your dissolve delay but you can't decrease it and the person also has to push the disolve button in order for the count down to begin

i honestly don't mean any disrespect and i apologies if anybody takes my comment the wrong way but i think the ones complaining are the ones being greedy that do not think about others or don't really care about the project success or network and only care about their own benefit

i will vote yes
i will take it even in step further
take it down to 4 instead of 5
if the way want to stacke fir 8 years , 12 years, whatever they like they can do the sane process every 4 years

if difinity lower the % reward 
tbey cry and complaint when this was announce from the begining

i have one idea 
what people will say or do
if dfinity decides to implement or requires a certain amount of ICP in order to stake for X amount of time

for example
you need a minimum of 1,000 icp to be able to stacke for 4 years

4 years being the new max

less than 333 icp = 1 year stacking

more than 334 less than 666 = 2 years stacking

more than 667 less than 999 = 3 years stacking

more than 1,000 = max stacking
number can be diferent or change but that will get rid of tbe problem

people demanding things
if you don't meet the minimun requirement then you have to select the option you can afford

[/quote]

I can only speak for myself but I can definitely say it's not about greed. I want ICP to flourish, I believe on the mission to create a secure world computer. 

Of course I hope to make money (you don't?) but I would be absolutely fine with less rewards if it would be necessary and really an effective measure. But that isn't the case. 

As I've shown in my previous post the sell pressure is currently dominated by VC token unlocks and not the modest inflation (really fixed 7% that slowly decrease to 5% is not high especially considering that over half of the rewards get restaked). 

The proposal would not reduce sell pressure to an extent worth to be mentioned. 

By the way the death spiral risk is caused how node provider get rewards not by staking rewards. A death spiral can only be prevented by reducing the node provider rewards if price falls under a critical point. But that's another topic...

So if you think this proposal is a good risk management measure: no it's not. It's a drop in the bucket, nothing more.

So in sum, if sell pressure is strong the next months a theoretical death spiral could occur regardless whether the proposal is accepted or not.

antoniooninato | 2024-05-15 09:13:57 UTC | #490

i respect your opinion, is common in life for people to have diferent opinions and diferent point of views, that is totally fine

if you really think about it
you even mention vc restaking
which it creates more tokens via rewards
then than turn into a vicious circle aka a loop
that is exactly the reason why dfinity has to do something and try to control and lower the rewards, some way some how

but even if stacking is lower to 5 years people can still restake after the period expire or simply increase the slider back to full 5 years every month that way they get the maximun rewards

this is what is all about

of course i want to make money
but i don't want to destroy the project just because i want to make money
how we are going to make money
if users destroy the project?

this is the reason why i wrote that there it has to be a balance that is beneficial for both
dfinity and the investors

for you it might be meaningless
but maybe you are looking at the short term 
but in a longer term it might be beneficial

when we 1st started the avg % in rewards for 8 years was much higher and it started going down little by little and i guess it might still continue to go down a little bit more
many people complaint but this was explained in the begining

those who got in early took advantage while it last it but you can't expect to have the same deal for ever and don't expect changes
specially when it was announce that things might change in the future and the reason why

many people simply wants to live off the rewards

stake for 8 years
get the max rewards
do not press the dissolve delay and get as much free icp you possibly can
then mint and sell those icp
while you still keep all your icp
waiting for the price to go extremely high

so what is happening there?
supply is increasing and sell preassure
it doesn't matter if is vc or the avg joe

nothing wrong with making rewards
nothing wrong with holding or staking
nothing wrong waiting for the proce to go up

what i think is wrong is not understanding how we can make things better simply because people only care about their personal interest
is all about me and i do not care about others including dfinity

we i got news for those who think that way
if dfinity fails then we all fail and we all
lose our money

if you want to make money
if you want to succed
you have to help dfinity win
that is the only way

i rather lose a little to win a lot
than to want more and lose everything
you are free to disagree

if the proposal fail then dfinity can also lower the % in rewards
either way i'm good
i have more than enough icp

at this point is obvious that we see things completely diferent

also my english is not perfect
but i still try
honestly i don't mean any disrespect
but i think you sre contradicting yourself

let me get this clear
you saying that stacking do not create new supply?

if vc restack half of their unlock tokens or at least a good amount of tokens for certain amount of time, they don't get more new tokens via reward?

back to your comment about a drop in the bucket, while it might look or seem like a little or meaningless, eventually that bucket is going to get full and then that will make a diference

at the end of the day
is not about what you and i think
is what the big majority thinks
in my opinion rewards are getting out of control

people just want to stacke for the long run 
they don't even care, follow or support the project, they just want to comeback 10 to 20 years into the future to cash out


that is if we make it and we get there
they want to destroy our present in order for them to build their future

funny thing is that is they destroy our present then they won't have any future

even we disagree
it was good talking to you
let's see how things play out

one last comment
the more free icp people get
the less icp that people will buy
if they want icp then make them buy it
instead of giving it to them for free
is ok a little % or a little amount
but huges amount of free icp creates a problem

[quote="antoniooninato, post:492, topic:30352"]
let me get this clear
you saying that stacking do not create new supply?

if vc restack half of their unlock tokens or at least a good amount of tokens for certain amount of time, they don’t get more new tokens via reward?
[/quote]

Maturity/tokens you stake are locked and thus cannot be sold. So real inflation is less if you don't sell rewards. But of course you get more rewards by increasing your voting power.

But that doesn't produce a form of hyper inflation as you imply by saying that rewards are out of control. Inflation decreases and has a target of 5% per year. 

Inflation is not a bad thing per se if you're able to compensate it (=staking).

It's comparable to putting your fiat into a money market funds: the fiat money inflates but the price of the fund increases, too, effectively giving you inflation protection.

And it doesn't matter if inflation is 0%, 2% or 7%, as long as you get compensated.

Just reducing rewards doesn't help the network. You hope for a magical positive price action that won't come by a small inflation reduction. Again: price is low because of VC token sells.

Inflation has a purpose: it motivates investors to stake/lock their tokens. With less inflation there is also less motivation for staking.

In the end the proposal is beneficial for people who don't want to stake or not for a long time. Meaning people that care more about their personal profits and less about the project. 

From that perspective this proposal is even harmful and that's not what I want.

now we are finally getting some where
thanks for bringing that up
because this will show or prove that changes has been made

so i don't understand why people are trying to put road blocks on progress
around a year ago maturity was added to the total amount, then something changed
i guess a proposal was passed and that locked maturity is now hidden from the total amount

so in the same way they did that to try to fix things and makes things better
i guess they are trying to do the same thing now again, problem is most people will complaint because dfinity is trying to take free stuff from them, meaning tokens rewards

i guess is not hard to understand how most people will act or react if you try to take things from them that they once were getting for free

of course they are going to complaint
who doesn't like free stuff

i'm not saying not to give rewards
all i'm saying that dfinity has to regulate things a bit better now, a few months ago when we were on the bear market and things were looking very bad, dfinity came with a few solutions because we had to survive that bear market and we did, we had a pump that gave us life and hope

but if we don't act now
we can easy go back to that same hole and this time we might not come out or survive
to avoid that that is better to make things as easy as possible now while we can

but most people simply want to act after is too late, while others don't wait until the last minute to act

by reducing the amount of token that are minted, created, added as rewards
that will lower the total supply

i'm also fair and i think is innevitable that dfinity eventually will have to take a look at their burning mechanism by increasing fees a bit that also will help burn more icp

the fees are way too low right now and a little tweak there might also help
so you see i'm fair

[/quote]

Reward reduction is currently the wrong measure. Maybe in a few years but currently the unlocks are the real issue. If you want to regulate that, you should instead propose to slow down VC unlocks. That would really help stabilize the price. But reducing rewards for a 2.6% reduction of sell pressure is pointless in the current situation and only punishes long term holders.

That's all what I had to say.

-------------------------

Luppo | 2024-05-15 13:03:49 UTC | #496

Cap all the lockers that got ICP pre official release. That sounds like the fairest way to go, how many millions ICP would this affect? Everyone who bought after May 10. 2021 should be able to keep 8 years stake. Future ICP staked from a set date, also max 5 years.

-------------------------

antoniooninato | 2024-05-15 15:14:55 UTC | #497

prolonging the agony is even worse
getting rid of all vc or seed investors asap for me is a better option

this month the last unlock was around 3 millions
tokens that was the last big unlock
we have around one year left of unlockings
if you check the amount that is going to be realease each month for the next year
the total amount is also around 3 millions
the unlocks are slowing down in amount
is better to finally get rid of the unlocks so we can finally move on
but you want to postpone them or slow them down

i don't see any benefit
that will make things even worse 
because the 1st thing people will do after their tokens unlock if the price is high
they will sell
but if their tokens unlocks and the price is low or not high enough, they might still hold, restacke or sell just a low portion of their bag

i really hope we can agree on something one day 😁😂😭

because in this topic we are going in opposite direction, is perfectly fine anyway
i also fun to have exchange diferent point of views, nothing personal
👍🏻

-------------------------

antoniooninato | 2024-05-15 15:51:23 UTC | #498

really think about it
if vc or seed investors are the problem
then getting rid of them asap is the best option

if dfinity slow down or put a hold on unlocks
then it will take longer to get rid of them
the 1st thing they will do after their tokens unlock if the price is high is sell or dump all their tokens driving the price down massively
after we were already up
is better to get rid of them now
while we are still low
since they bought at 0.03
they might sell a big amount of their bag or at least a reasonable amount

then we go back to square one
the never ending story if they keep restacking their tokens, since they have so many tokens
they can easily create a lot more via rewards
they are chocking us to death
we will never move up untill we get rid of them
by slowing down or reducing the rewards that will create less tokens
that os good for a 1st step in the right direction
but a few nore steps has to be taken after that
but things will get a lot worse if we simply don't do anything

also by reducing the amount of icp that people will get via rewards that will stop people from stacking for such a long periods of time
because the amount they will get is no longer really worth waiting all that time, i think that will help to control supply from increasing

-------------------------

bloppelsteg | 2024-05-15 17:28:36 UTC | #499

They obvs can't answer that because of the way the SEC automagically considers something a security if the founders are caught guaranteeing or intimating that something should be X price.

You can see the price action of ICP IOUs up to the launch date [here](https://coincodex.com/crypto/internet-computer-iou/?start=2019-09-04&end=2021-05-11).

Isn't inflation a problem? While LUNA coin was at $130 and a supply of 150,000,000 tokens, luna coin dropped to $0.00000001 with the release of 4.5 trillion tokens in one day. This event was a very good experiment that showed what inflation is.

The things that look wrong to you are easily figured out if you consider it's effectively a dead page that was replaced by the [new one](https://coincodex.com/crypto/internet-computer/) when the token launched:

The 99% figure includes an ATH wick from the last day on FTX and start on Binance (which still seems to be smoothed-down, but most sites smooth wicks out completely)
This old page only displayed data from MEXC and FTX at the time and stopped being updated once FTX jumped out the window - MEXC isn't considered a trusted website.

New metrics without the pre-launch screwarounds for anybody who bothered to look display as:

A company paying a 6.36% dividend can't be trusted, and thats ICP right now.
8 year guys need to understand that if inflation won't go down the first that are harmed are them. 
ICP will go to zero unless inflation goes down at least a 50%.

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-05-16 09:06:03 UTC | #506

A simple thing we can do is set the inflation to trend to zero after 8 years, instead of stopping at 5%. That would respect current contracts and set a path towards deflation. We can always increase the rewards later on if needed.

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-16 09:30:24 UTC | #507

Didn't Dfinity put a deflationary measure into the reward system already? Dropping down to 5% over X amount of years? Like they thought about this already. Didn't they also already make a tokenomics change since launch? What happens when we accept this reduction and then in 6 months we have another "Hey guys we need to cut your rewards again" proposal? Anyone who was on Taggr within the last few months has an idea of how this could go. Rewards were changed multiple times and a lot of people lost faith and sold because it wasn't what was agreed upon when they signed up. Maybe we need to follow suite and lose 60% of our users in order to be sustainable long term but it'll be another black eye on the chart when we drop to new ATL. Future adoption will be almost non-existent at that point.

-------------------------

bloppelsteg | 2024-05-16 09:46:27 UTC | #508

BTC's inflation rate was higher until 2016 and was double that again for its first 4 years, still seems to have done well fairly well for itself.

I'd argue adoption is our main problem, I'm sure Dfinity are as stunned as I am that the wider ETH dev community aren't all over it because a good few were hyped about the possibilities 7-8 years ago but in the meantime their community grew by an order of magnitude at minimum so the amount who knew what Dfinity was by the time launch rolled around was easily less than 10% of the wider dev community, it was just another random new project appearing before their eyes so now the 90%+ have to be spoonfed (against their will, they make it a struggle) the history and purpose pre-2021.

-------------------------

osman | 2024-05-16 14:05:39 UTC | #509

The exact supply limit of BTC has been determined. This information alone is enough to push the price of BTC up. There is no supply limit on platforms such as ICP. Everyone's expectation is that applications will be created on the platform, the platform will finance itself by making money from it, and the rest of the earnings will be given to token holders as a reward.
Since there is no gain;
1- Tokens are printed to finance the platform
2- In order to save token prices in the market from downward pressure, they distribute rewards to token holders in return for staking.
In other words, there is a mechanism that creates inflation.
1-The most permanent way to turn this mechanism into a definitive one is for the platform to make money.
2-Otherwise, all token holders, node holders and definity foundation  must continue on their way with a common sacrifice and minimum inflation tokenomics.
3- One must somehow find new investors to deposit money into the Definity ICP token and the ICP platform. In this scenario, the arrival of new investors will reduce the need to mint tokens, as the commission fees arising from ICP wallet transfers will increase with the increase in transaction volume on the ICP platform.

antoniooninato | 2024-05-16 22:25:46 UTC | #512

while i understand that dfinity did mentioned and specified that the % in rewards was propense to be change, alter or modify based on a few factors, i also understand that dfinity can't simply try to fix something just by only cutting down on rewards

at some point dfinity also has to look at another alternatives and try to find a way to fix things without doing the same process over and over again, because people are going to feel like they are being target and they are the ones paying for everything

soon dfinity will have to take a look at the fee or burning mechanism, i do understand that they want to keep the price down but they can increase the fee just a little and still keep the price down to be competitive

they can't take everything just from one side or sector, fees are ridicously small a little bump won't hurt, we need to burn cycles and keep supply down in order for the price to go up

-------------------------

osman | 2024-05-16 22:45:12 UTC | #513

As I mentioned in my article above, sacrifices should not be expected only from stakers. If sacrifices are required to reduce inflation, all parties must sacrifice equally

-------------------------

antoniooninato | 2024-05-16 23:10:25 UTC | #514

i totally agree with you sir
100%

if we are willing to sacrifice for the greater good
then is fair for dfinity to also do the same

i do agree with the proposal to cut down a little bit on rewards because i think too many tokens are bein created

i guess is fair to expect dfinity to increase a little bit the fees in order to increase or speed up the burning mechanism

dfinity to be fair and i think many people has already mentioned this as a possibility or alternative to help fight or reduce inflation

-------------------------

Luppo | 2024-05-17 00:32:53 UTC | #515

All well and good. Still let seed investors get a max 5 year neuro lock. + future locks. Atleast start with seed investors. Getting ICP at 0.03$ and forever gaining massively from neuron stake is kinda heartbreaking for retail.

Hi all, 

I have provided further analysis on the proposals in this thread in a separate [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/analysis-of-proposals-on-neuron-dissolve-delays-and-exchange-maturity/30890). 

In a nutshell, we suggest to not pursue the two proposals further, given the concerns raised and the relatively low impact.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-17 14:18:12 UTC | #518

@Hitman I know I don't know definitively the answer about the yield, lol that's why I said don't quote me, the answer will need to come from someone who does. 😅

I made a guess/assumption based on what I thought could be a possible reason. My line of thinking was, it would make sense to me if different countries/jurisdictions have different legal requirements when advertising a rate of return. To protect the consumer interest perhaps from things like predatory lending etc, or maybe to simplify the numbers for people with a standardised "measurement", I don't know. But what I do know is that I have noticed the same thing as @Slav.ICP regarding the numbers on the yield. 

But I made it clear that I wasn't 100% on it so they knew I might be wrong and that it was an assumption, was just adding to the question in a way I could. 
People make assumptions on things they don't know based on their own internal reasoning, making initial assumptions based on individual reasoning (with the intention of tweaking with new information) is a part of learning in general for a lot of people, so I don't see why you would discourage that, but each their own.

It made sense to me as a POSSIBLE reason and still does, but I also would like to know a definitive answer. 

Lol I know you said don't assume ☝️. 
But because you obviously know my answer is wrong, I'm going to assume you know the actual answer. 
Could you please share it with @Slav.ICP and myself?
As I'm keen to know also.
Thanks

@bjoernek I have some questions about the neurons fund. Any feedback is welcome, thanks.

I noticed people aren't really incentivised to participate in the neurons fund, is this deliberate or would dfinity ideally like to see more people contributing more ICP to the fund?

Currently I would say the individual incentive is to not participate due to possible risk of loss of maturity, do you agree?

This is more aimed at the topic of inflation and how the neuron fund works I guess.

As it stands now, the ICP that is committed by the neurons fund into projects (for example ELNA) on the launchpad, does dfinity receive project tokens (ELNA) in return for the ICP from the fund? 
Or is the ICP allocation from the fund considered a grant as such?

What if this was how participation in the fund worked at an individual level?
Would it do anything for inflation?

Something like the following.
Maturity that has been allocated to the neuron fund via staking is committed evenly to projects on the launchpad in exchange for the project tokens (exactly how the launchpad works, but taken automatically and incrementally from allocated maturity). 

So X amount of ICP is removed from that person's maturity, they then receive X amount of the new token in their wallet as you would normally when using the launchpad. 

It's effectively no different to actively participating in a launch, however it's automatic and more evenly distributed across projects over the long term and it's taken from the maturity of however much you choose to participate in the fund. 

It would give people small exposure to most projects being launched spread out over time.
 
Obviously I'm assuming here that in general the projects are much more likely to burn the ICP rather than hold it. 

Does this make sense? Would this have any meaningful impact on inflation or is it just kicking the problem down the road?

I think people would be more likely to allocate some of their staked ICP to the fund if they were also getting exposure to the many projects going through the launchpad and would willingly part ways with their ICP maturity if this is how participation in the fund worked. 
I'm just not sure if it would help with inflation in the way or extent that I think it could.

What do you think? 
Or is there something I'm missing as to why it wouldn't work?

Thanks

-------------------------

MDC | 2024-05-18 23:42:34 UTC | #521

I'm just a little guy out there hoping to earn some passive income in the future with staked ICP. I don't have time to read all these comments. But I think you should leave existing neurons alone and whatever you want to do should only affect neurons that are created **after** the proposal passes. I can't afford to add more ICP to my neuron now. But I don't like the idea of my neuron getting reduced to 5 years if I decide I can contribute more ICP to it x amount of time from now.

hi i think a very important point is not being taken under consideration

first i want to make clear that i'm not criticizing the excellent job that was put together and the data that was used to explain everything in a simple way

but i think there is something missing, the numbers that are being use to make the calculations, are the current numbers

everything that is not there that will come later is not being taken under consideration

how the numbers will look if we don't put a stop to this 8 years stacking madness now
everybody buys icp and stack them for 8 years, the number will continue to increase and go up
then it won't be the little or insignificant number that we are getting now as a result
emphasized text
i honestly think that is better to lower the amount of time from 8 to 5 because no one can't deny that a year neuron creates more free icp that a 5 year neuron

therefore the quantity of icp being created as reward will be much less

my point 
the number or % being look is only the current
but that number can be or go much higher creating a higher % or bigger inflation problem

you guys are looking at short term and not a long term
anyway just my opinion

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2024-05-19 14:05:05 UTC | #525

It doesn't matter how many people respectively how much ICP is staked. The amount of new maturity is the same. This means if more people stake for 8 years all get less rewards. There's no horror scenario.

Btw. it is actually a good thing for price if 80%-90% is staked since this would result into an supply shock sooner or later.

-------------------------

antoniooninato | 2024-05-19 15:51:00 UTC | #526

i understand your points
they are both valids
but if we use the same logic
then 5 year neurons will create less supply or rewards than 8 year neurons

i think the problem is that people are extremist and only see benefits if is a drastic change
they don't see any good or use if is something that they consider small or insignificant

if is small or insignificance then it can be small or insignificant either way

while the 2nd comment or statement is true
because stacking will stop most people from selling
that actually doesn't guarrantee anything because anyone can their their internet identity at any time in geek id

i will reduce staking to 4 year max
increase fees only on exchanges
day traders should pay a little extra
sending from or to the NNS will stay the same
or probably a little increase too won't hurt
but theonesthat has to pay a bit more
are the ones buying and selling
that will help a little
then when you add both new methods together that will make a diference
enough for now to help stabilize a little

i don't understand why the opposition
if is something that will make things better

anyway one way or another dfinity will make things better eventually

people just want free icp even if that keeps creating new supply and it keeps holding back the price

This idea has a lot of potential, but some will say: “I thought I knew I was following XYZ and then the network reset my follows when I wasn’t looking; insiders took advantage of me!” etc.
[/quote]

Sure some people might say that but they won't have  a leg to stand on because they should be looking after their investments. If someone can pay every once every six months they are probably not contributing much to the network anyways.  We could publish a reminder on all the main social media platforms a week prior to each reset. 

There is no reason to not follow through with a periodic reset after two years of being passed.

i do not want to go off topic here
but since the whole idea or purpose behind the proposal is to try to reduce inflation and while the proposal is design for that
a few other options are also good for that like increasing feed in order to burn more cycles

but some times even a good idea might seem a little crazy or inlogicalfor others
while probably a crazy or inlogical idea might be perfectly fine for others

i have a crazy idea going around in my head
why don't we just call it
burnathon

like once a month for the next few months
or whatever time dfinity thinks is necesary to create a burnathon

users contribute 1 icp
we need a minimun of 5,000 icp minum in order to execute the burning proposal
if we don't reach the minumun amount then all tokens are return to their rightful owners

1st price = 1,000 icp
2nd price = 500 icp
3rd price = 100 icp

trust me a lot of people are going to participate because they are only putting one icp with the chance of winning from 100 to 1,000 icp

the rest of the tokens will be burn

let's just assume that 20,000 users participate
then that means that 18,400 icp will be burn

the number can be more or less but that is a good start, do that for a few months and that will help burn some icp while users also participate with the chance of winning icp

they make money
we burn icp
everybody is happy

the ones that don't win
only lost 1 icp
i can live happy risking 1 icp with tbe chance of winning up to 1,000 icp even if idon't win

just by people participating and we burning supply, pricecan go up

i think is a good idea
burnathon

So X amount of ICP is removed from that person’s maturity, they then receive X amount of the new token in their wallet as you would normally when using the launchpad.
[/quote]
What currently happens is close to what you are describing: Users/controllers of NF neurons receive hotkeys to SNS neurons and can participate in SNS voting. At a later point in time, once the SNS tokens are sold by NNS, the received ICP is burned and users will receive an according amount of maturity. 
However there is one obstacle to this process in the moment: Token liquidity of most SNS projects is very low and hence it would be very challenging to trigger this process in the moment.

i have another susgestion or solution
the whole idea about not even pressing tbe dissolve delay button and leaving an 8 year neuron in not dissolving state for ever
milking the cow and creating new supply
i think is total madness

how about a proposal
that put a limit on how long a neuron can be on non dissolving state

meaning that the user has a max of 2 years to press the button and if the person doesn't press the button then the neuron automatically beging dissolving or the countdown

once a neuron reaches the max of 2 years
the person can't stop the neuron from dissolving

my susgestion that i know many are not going to like it

4 years max neuron stacking
2 years max neuron in non dissolve state

is absurd having people stacking for 8 years and not pressing the dissolve delay button
constantly creating new supply
lowering the price

enough of the non sense
is time for a change

I don't think that's a brilliant idea. A lot of coins would be released in a short period of time and then I'm curious to see how the price develops. You just have to burn a lot more, then it will lead to the goal. There is a high risk involved in not liquidating and this should be rewarded accordingly.

Actually, I think it would be good to implement reconfirmation for non-dissolving neurons, since there will be lost wallets, and over time vast amounts of ICP may be staked that will forever dilute supply with rewards that will never be claimed.

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2024-05-25 06:58:22 UTC | #537

A lost neuron won't increase supply since you get maturity not ICP as rewards and maturity only increases voting power. Loosing access to a neuron is thus deflationary.

CMC status is important.
But it's also reflective of success.

ICP has potential that still needs to be converted into success.

At this time, inflation is only a problem for those who are not fully invested in ICP. For those who believe in its success, patience has been and will continue to be a virtue.

The maturity is basically ICP, and while it's true that we are receiving rewards in maturity now, that may change in the future. In my opinion, rewards should be given only to "active" accounts, so reconfirming activity every few years would have a beneficial effect.

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2024-05-25 10:57:50 UTC | #540

No it's not. As long as you don't disburse maturity, ICP is not affected in any way. Not even rewards are affected since the amount of maturity minted per year depends on the total ICP supply and not staked maturity. If noone would disburse maturity to ICP we'd have effectively no inflation (neglecting node provider rewards).

By giving rewards only to active accounts the probability of higher inflation is in fact higher since active accounts are more willing to disburse maturity than inactive ones.

You do know that maturity was not the thing  at the genesis, and it was changed later on through a governance vote. Who is to say that it won't be changed again, especially since, in some jurisdictions, it could be viewed as tax evasion? 

**The main thing is, do we want any kind of rewards for lost wallets?**

-------------------------

reminiscence | 2024-05-25 11:22:32 UTC | #542

Of course everything can be changed in future. But why discussing something hypocritical that is not relevant for the present?

I don't see any need for not giving rewards. It's simply not relevant IMHO.

It's always wise to plan ahead for future events. 
I'm not saying it should be done; that's up to a possible governance vote. 
I'm simply gauging others opinions on the matter.

Mpeiz | 2024-05-25 12:27:27 UTC | #544

Thanks, yeah I didn't know it worked. I did a test on two small neurons over just a small amount of time, so it may be inaccurate. But I noticed the neuron participating in the neuron fund received less in maturity than the other one. Why would this be? 
Because I was considering putting more of my main neuron in the neurons fund but as long as the rewards were the same as if I wasn't participating. 

But they seemed to be less? Is the maturity return on participating in the fund supposed to be equal to the regular return or is there some other variable?
Thanks

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-25 12:59:38 UTC | #545

Thanks again for explaining that.
Who are the users/controllers of NF who receive these tokens? 
Are these the NF participants or the actual NF itself?

But yeah I get your point that the price difference makes it irrelevant.

Serious question here, if anyone could answer, can the Internet Computer sustain a price of $0.5 - 3 during another bear market...?

Will this price cause it to inflate faster like Luna? or are there proactive measures in place against this happening ? Asking because I hear all node providers are paid in a fiat-rate, irrespective of $icp price/market cap/liquidity

Your suggestion of simply increasing the trend to 0% or 1% as opposed to stopping at 5% seems simple and effective in regards to solving the problem over a long time period

inb4 deathspiral FUD

BTC is near its ATH, if it dumps into another depression within the next year is it really FUD for icp to prepare for a potential low price, seeing as we are inflating incredibly quickly either way at the moment 

Otherwise icp will literally print over the whole of the BTC supply every year with current supply and above 5+% inflation, which would increase further if we dump again. Not a good look

Maturity was a thing at Genesis


maturity modulation wasn't a thing at genesis.


Neurons received voting rewards as maturity, which they could use to mint new ICP tokens.


In the end, maturity has always been used to Mint New ICP tokens -> inflation.


Are neurons the Bonds of ICP? does that Make DFINITY the federal reserve?

Unlike Luna, ICP doesn't allow conversion of cycles into new ICP tokens. Burn happens only 1 way, i.e. burning ICP for Cycles (computation gas)


Only way you can mint new tokens is by

1. Node Provider (NP) rewards -> fixed and managed manually by DFINITY, distributed by NP Reward proposal
2. Voting rewards -> Maturity used to mint ICP tokens
3. A tokenomics proposal to mint tokens by the NNS (theoretically possible)


Death spiral shouldn't be a threat unless the price falls too low for a long time and there are thousands of nodes that need to be compensated while accounting for this low price action, since NP Rewards get calculated in Fiat, not ICP tokens.


Example

Lets assume that Node Provider rewards are $1,000 per month for 1 Node.


If ICP price is $100 USD, then Node Provider rewards distributed to them will be 1000/100 = 10 ICP tokens


If price of ICP is $1 USD, then NP rewards will be 1000 ICP.



On the other hand, fixed inflation and deflation is healthy for good economy, especially in blockchains since they guarantee immutability and no central authority is able to modify tokenomics however it wants and whenever it wants.


Modifying tokenomics with low quality proposals only ruin the credibility of the blockchain.

The controlller of NF SNS neurons is the NNS. However, individual members of the NF (i.e. the controller of NF NNS neurons) receive hotkeys for NF SNS neurons linked to them, so that they can vote and define following (see also the explanation [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/neurons-fund/#3-participation-in-sns-governance)).

**Moderator's note:**

**TLDR**: I am locking this thread, but not because of any bad behavior, but because I have gotten a lot of feedback that its too large to properly digest properly. Too many ideas and comments. New ideas can come from new threads.



In fact, one main comment which many people missed was this one:

[quote="bjoernek, post:517, topic:30352, full:true"]
Hi all,

I have provided further analysis on the proposals in this thread in a separate [post ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/analysis-of-proposals-on-neuron-dissolve-delays-and-exchange-maturity/30890).

In a nutshell, we suggest to not pursue the two proposals further, given the concerns raised and the relatively low impact.
[/quote]

In this comment, @bjoernek is writing on behalf of DFINITY explaining why DFINITY got the feedback Dom was looking for, and **DFINITY decided to not pursue the proposal further.**

There is even a new thread about it here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/analysis-of-proposals-on-neuron-dissolve-delays-and-exchange-maturity/30890
