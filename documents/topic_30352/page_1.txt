The great thing about the NNS is that it isn't static and that it is able to grow/improve, but this is also the most scary ICP concept for a lot of people.

I think the fact that these types decisions are hard to pass and take a lot of discussion is in itself a feature and not a bug. **It's democracy of a DAO in action**, big changes need a lot of community deliberation.

As long as existing neurons aren't changed by default, and even get a choice, then I think this ultimately shows the power of the NNS to evolve while remaining stable and trustworthy.

I also love seeing all these different perspectives from various DFINITY team members like yourself, and Dom's thoughtful replies in response to feedback. DFINITY's doing some great work in this thread and it's appreciated!

There will always be a few trolls like cat pirate, but that's because people really love ICP and care deeply about this network. Just remember what Leslie Knope says:

ICPewPew | 2024-05-06 20:55:36 UTC | #130

My man Dom,
 Sorry but i would not feel good about this regarding my self interest. I have saved up and locked up my 8 year neuron with intent of receiving 1 ICP in rewards daily for the foreseeable future. The fact that my neuron would be reduced to a 5 year stake and accrue less % and maturity would not sit right with me for i never intended on dissolving my neuron, with that in mind i figured i would recoup my investment via maturity within 5-6 years and now if this happens it would take A LOT longer, it doesn't seem right. Also 8 year staker (8 yearsgang) would be considered the most loyal no? putting commitment for 8 years, this is not wanted by the 8 yearsgang community from what i see on X so it would be doing a disservice to us imo. Now my opinion is to allow people with 8 year neurons who would like to reduce to 5 years do so which i don't think would be many at all and let the rest of us keep our neuron at 8 years with current stats, we would be the ultimate OG neurons. but maybe turn off adding ICP and maybe auto stake maturity to these neurons for the sake of your point of reducing the stake in the 1st place. maybe set a certain date were after that date no more auto maturity and adding ICP to 8 year neurons occur.  I personally don't feel positive at all about changing this up it affects us most loyal to the project and our rewards not cool imo. srry Dom know its prob not what you wanna hear but this is how I and i think a lot of us 8 yearsgang stakers feel as well.

Pew Pew Bang Bang 8 YEARSGANG for life!

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-05-06 20:57:22 UTC | #131

Ok, I came late to suggest giving people this option 😅. (Although 5Y neurons might not be so happy with it).

In the future, it would be nice to have the rewards somehow dependent on the cycle burning, in the direction of futarchy.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2024-05-06 20:57:26 UTC | #132

It is not a pay cut though. It's more of a reduced time staked. Kind of like if your employer cut your weekly hours from 40 to 30. Sure it's a reduced income but it's not a pay cut  since the amount you get paid per hour does not change. Still sucks though. Likewise for this new proposal you have your ICP stake for 5 years which is a 37% decrease in how long you have to Wait until your ICP is fully dissolved.

-------------------------

jamesbeadle | 2024-05-06 21:00:53 UTC | #133

Yeah but the neuron will be forever staked, it's only use is to pay developers. So on 8 years it pays the development team 10K ICP a year, and on 5 years 8K ICP is a pay cut.

-------------------------

MotokoMartin | 2024-05-06 21:06:21 UTC | #134

Yes, I love this.

Also made a post about in on X if anyone would like te debate on it.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 21:12:40 UTC | #135

People always appreciate choice and having time to decide... So over six months, say, the network could progressively lower the max neuron dissolve delay of neurons with >5Y delay *if* they haven't opted to keep it the same.

An "Opt-out of dissolve delay reduction" neuron config checkbox would be added. If this wasn't checked, then 3 months after an NNS proposal was adopted agreeing the tokenomics change, say, an 8Y neuron's dissolve delay would have fallen to 6.5Y, and the owner wouldn't be able to put it back.

That would give early neuron holders the choice/freedom to stay where they are with all the same behaviors if that's what they want, as well as time to decide, together with some extra degree of adjustability if they wish to compromise by e.g. allowing a delay to fall to just 7 (neuron splitting functionality would be useful for helping neuron holders get the balance they want)

This arrangement looks pretty win-win on first sight.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-06 21:07:31 UTC | #136

I feel as though by eliminating the ability to create 8 Year Neurons, you’re simultaneously eliminating the greatest marketing campaign we have for staking - the 8 Year Gang - which not only secures the network through voting power, but also combats the inflation of the network, given the duration of stakes. 

I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but maybe it’s more appropriate to bring deflationary factors in alignment with inflationary factors than trying to simply remove more voting rewards to combat inflation.

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2024-05-06 21:11:49 UTC | #137

I mean, leading up to the implementation of this I'm betting we'd see an "8 year gang" gold rush.

Also, it'll immortalize those who got the 8 year neurons and choose to keep them. Imagine an "8 Year Gang OG Lounge" at a future ICPCC conference, lol!

I reacted irrationally originally to this post, i've since had time to reflect and talk to others, so I apolgize for that, let's just wait and see what the new roadmap on the 10th looks like before myself especially lose my head when there's perhaps no need to, as others maybe keeping theirs

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2024-05-06 21:14:02 UTC | #140

How about giving an option to 8 years locked neurons to stay as 8 years or change it to 5 years, . Going forward, 8 years neurons no longer offered and maximum up to 5 years!

HELLLL NOOOO to give a 20% hair cut to the 8 year gang.
NO NO NO
Im pissed off that that is even a proposal.
8 year gang stacked to get that specific percentage.
If the 8 year gang wanted to stacked to 5 year, they would have done that instead 

No comment on number 2, difficult to understand if someone can please explain with a simple 100ICP staked example

-------------------------

Schnitzel | 2024-05-06 21:21:01 UTC | #145

After reading all the comments, YES! that would definitely the best solution.

-------------------------

CA1 | 2024-05-06 21:21:58 UTC | #146

You stake 100 ICP
You gain 1 maturity
You use that 1 maturity to "free" one of your ICP's (instead of spawning it)
You have 99 ICP staked and 1 "free maturity"
The reason this is appealing is because of tax-reasons, because you are able to substitute your locked ICP over time, so it isn't "realized" which creates a taxable event.

-------------------------

amircryptola1 | 2024-05-06 21:23:25 UTC | #147

It’s really encouraging to see the active and vibrant discussions in here but I have to ask - why hasn’t this been implemented yet? This will have the largest impact by far on inflation and ensure the community is most active in governance

Not only that but there is plenty of precedent in other networks doing the same — for example in DOT or ATOM networks you have to check and make sure your validators are still active and participating, otherwise you won’t earn your rewards. 

Didn’t the proposal for this already pass too @dominicwilliams

-------------------------

ScouseWill79 | 2024-05-06 21:23:54 UTC | #148

Would this mean if we opted to keep out >5 yr (ie 8 yr) we wouldn't be able to add to it? Just wondering

-------------------------

CA1 | 2024-05-06 21:29:38 UTC | #150

In a top-up sense at the very least - yes - with accruing maturity probably also, but that is more debatable.
The problem with allowing top-ups is that someone could buy a neuron with 1 ICP (EDIT: that was already staked for 8 years) and add 999 to it and suddenly have circumvented the entire “8-year-gang” concept.

-------------------------

ScouseWill79 | 2024-05-06 21:30:55 UTC | #151

I'd not considered that but then i'm just a small fry and couldn'tif I wanted to, all pro's and cons though I suppose as I probably wouldn't be able to hit my target of 111 staked on this neuron so would probably look to offload for liquid and have to put into the 5 yr one

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2024-05-06 21:31:56 UTC | #152

No, after the one-time choice to keep our  >5 yr (ie 8 yr) neuron, topping up the neuron would become impossible.
As he stated in the reply.
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/possible-optimizations-of-nns-tokenomics/30352/125?u=ic_maximillion

-------------------------

ScouseWill79 | 2024-05-06 21:32:29 UTC | #153

So at earning 0.01 per day, I suppose i'd have to unload to get the liquid to pop into a 5 yr neuron if I couldn't top up

-------------------------

Infinity-and-beyond | 2024-05-06 21:38:46 UTC | #154

Ahh waw, that is a nice explanation. 
Right, so the proposed is "tax neutral" 
but the current model is, if I "spawn," that equals New ICP which equals New Income which I have to pay taxes on. Is that right?

-------------------------

Infinity-and-beyond | 2024-05-06 21:49:39 UTC | #155

that is a way better proposal 
dont hurt the current 8 year gang

-------------------------

CA1 | 2024-05-06 21:50:58 UTC | #156

Yes, basically the 100 staked ICP that can be freed should be tax exempt, because you already paid tax on them once. As far as I understand (not tax advice) with most traditional tax-systems this is not the case for maturity, because it is a bi-product of your taxed asset that hasn't yet been taxed.

-------------------------

Monkeycruise | 2024-05-06 21:56:37 UTC | #157

Hello everyone,

I want to express my appreciation for the ongoing discussions surrounding adjustments to our tokenomics. It's clear that many of us, as long-term participants, have a vested interest in the potential changes being proposed.

One important consideration highlighted in these discussions is the perspective of those who have committed to an 8-year lock-up period. For many of us, this decision was made with certain return expectations based on proposed schedules. Therefore, any proposed reduction in the lock-up period coupled with decreased rewards may not align with our original motivations. The 8-year-gang for the most part was going to be around way longer than 8 years with some possibly not even hitting that dissolve buttons until many decades later. Keeping that in mind lower the dissolve to 5 years fails to be a valuable incentive for this cohort of contributors.

One potential solution that could be explored is allowing current 8-year holders to maintain their existing APY schedule, provided they refrain from adding to their neuron. This approach would acknowledge the expectations set when capital was committed for an extended period.

I'm grateful to be part of this community and value the contributions of all members in finding solutions that benefit us collectively.

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:105, topic:30352, full:true"]
re: Proposal 1, the idea could arguably work with these modifications:

1) All holders of neurons where dissolve delays is above 5Y, are given a one-time choice per neuron:
-- Drop to 5Y
-- Stay at >5Y (e.g. stay at 8Y)

2) After the change, it would become impossible to set the dissolve delay beyond 5Y on new or existing neurons (even though some early neurons would stay at 8Y because their owners want to maximize maturity growth and bought into that config)

3) Adjust the overall neuron reward down so that, given some amount of ICP locked, some age, and some dissolve delay, maturity continues growing at very nearly exactly the _same_ rate it does today 

This would still have some immediate impact, since I think many early people would probably hedge and allow some of their neurons to drop to 5Y, and obviously over a long period of time the impact would grow, because it wouldn't be possible to create new 8Y neurons.

[EDIT/UPDATE on seeing what MotokoMartin said]
4) And it would become impossible to top-up a neuron with >5Y dissolve delay (otherwise the change could be circumvented)
[/quote]




I think this is a reasonable adjustment to Proposal 1, as it provides some degree of control as well as preparation time for those currently in > 5 YR stakes. It also would allow somewhat of a “grandfathered in” situation to early supporters.

-------------------------

5oclockk | 2024-05-06 22:02:12 UTC | #160

I believe you need to take into consideration the high interest rates in the US. Right now, I took on debt at a rate lower then the APY gained from current t 8-year $ICP. By lowering this to 5-year, you'll lose out on those capitalizing on that difference. In addition, whether 5 or 8 years, the majority is locking until minimum retirement if not for life. I think you'll have LESS people locking the max which will limit the current benefit of dwindling supply. 

When supply lowers, the price will eventually go up. I think inflation needs to be combatted with utilization and burn.

Monkeycruise | 2024-05-06 22:08:34 UTC | #162

This I can definitely get behind! It addresses some of the sentiment comments I made earlier and this proposal is better aligned with investor behaviour for decisions to be made, and that have been made in the past. I am supportive of a change that will surely have a positive impact on the network and it’s tokenomics whilst still ensuring people feel supported on long term investments they have already committed to.

-------------------------

Feelgood | 2024-05-06 22:24:53 UTC | #163

This sounds fair to me, but I hope I can still top up my 8year neuron with my staked maturity.
It should only be impossible to top up the >5 neuron with new ICP.

Ilike the exchange or „free“ your stacked ICP for maturity, too. At least this is how I understand proposal 2.

-------------------------

toasterfrog | 2024-05-06 22:19:33 UTC | #164

Some scattered ideas:

1) Increasing cycle usage = need for cycles = deflationary ICP. Why doesn't DFINITY subsidize running crypto architecture for other projects. Run an Ethereum RPC. Or validators for some other project. This would burn cycles (reverse gas model but DFINITY would foot the bill) and allow for other projects to see the power of DFINITY actually have an effect on their network. It is tough for any crypto project to take a leap and run infrastructure on ICP - for now. Why not DFINITY lead the way and help to burn some cycles themselves? 

2) Pay 8 year neuron's maturity from DFINITY's own treasury for a set period of time. 

This forum post is moot because in the end it comes down to a vote via the neurons and we all know who holds the majority voting power. If DFINITY did not hold the majority vote then all neurons would vote for what is most economically favorable to them - which this proposal is not.

-------------------------

toasterfrog | 2024-05-06 22:34:24 UTC | #165


*DFINITY does not have the majority power but it does hold quite a large amount. I wonder if a proposal to reduce rewards would even be voted in by neurons if DFINITY only has ~20% voting power.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2024-05-06 22:30:26 UTC | #166

@dominicwilliams 

One additional point to consider here is that DFINITY is currently https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597, which will make it much easier to transfer control of neurons. This change will then make it significantly easier for secondary neuron marketplaces to pop up without needing to sell the attached Internet Identity, decreasing the commitment and "risk" that an investor makes when purchasing ICP and staking it for 8 years.

[quote="aiv, post:138, topic:30352"]
I mean, leading up to the implementation of this I’m betting we’d see an “8 year gang” gold rush.

Also, it’ll immortalize those who got the 8 year neurons and choose to keep them. Imagine an “8 Year Gang OG Lounge” at a future ICPCC conference, lol!
[/quote]

While an OG system works with fundraising and gamified achievement systems, the Internet Computer is a mature, decentralized network. Any two-tiered approach will result in unintended side-effects of grandfathering in 8-year neurons, such as secondary neuron marketplaces.

We already have [IDGeek](https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.icp0.io/marketplace), which has facilitated the transfer over 170k ICP (~2 million USD) worth of "locked" ICP assets, and has 22k ICP (~250k USD) off assets listed for sale. If a "grandfathered", two-tiered approach does end up passing and allows investors to keep their >5 year neurons, we'd undoubtedly soon see 8 year neurons going for significantly higher prices on these secondary marketplaces.

Therefore, I do **not** believe we should create a 2-tiered system between the "OGs" and the present ICP stakers, just to make everyone (e.g. 8-year neuron holders, of which I am one) happy? 

It follows that the fairest approach is for the change to apply to both new and existing neurons. 

[quote="dfisher, post:27, topic:30352"]
Option 1 makes sense to reduce inflation. I’d also argue it’s a good idea to just keep it simple and make the change on all existing and new neurons. Yes it’ll go down for some neurons, but c’est la vie. It doesn’t seem so drastic.
[/quote]

The real question being is if current 8-year neuron holders have the long-term inflation interests of the IC in mind, or are nearly thinking "short term" about their APY. It's sort of funny how people can have short-term thoughts while holding long-term neurons.

[quote="aiv, post:106, topic:30352"]
my goal was to someday live on neuron rewards without needing to dissolve.
[/quote]

A decentralized network requires active participation. Investment in the NNS that votes and stays up to date, not an inflated rewards system that allows people to passively sit on their 8-year neurons and complain about necessary long-term changes, which may seem painful in the short-term.

This theme of active participation ties in nicely with some of the other approaches to reduce inflation raised by @LightningLad91, especially periodic confirmation of followees.

[quote="LightningLad91, post:98, topic:30352"]
* Reduce max dissolve delay to 5 years - I’ve always felt 8 was way too long.
* Redistribute rewards so that 5 year dissolve is is getting rewards proportional to their commitment - this is honestly common sense and would help reduce the impact of the 20% hit.
* Implement the periodic reconfirmation of follower settings - if people can set it and forget it then there really is no reason to be active. We’re defeating ourselves.
[/quote]

As for the note on periodic confirmation of followees, one can put the date far enough out there (4th anniversary of the IC in 2025) and give people 6 months to reset their followees. DFINITY has a strong social reach on email marketing and socials, and the ICP community can also do their part. The community already voted in favor of the proposal, so it's a relatively light engineering lift awaiting implementation.

So what if the price for 8-year neurons increased; the people who are early (and probably planned to never unstake anyway) should be rewarded regardless. What is your actual argument against having a two-tiered system, because I couldn't actually find any arguments besides the secondary market one, which doesn't even directly refute the point of rewarding early investors and people who never planned to unstake.

Addendum: in most intellectual forums it is given that the person with the positive claim has to provide evidence for their claims. In this sense, I think it is completely fair to assume the burden of proof (I.E providing good reasons) for changing the entire system from 8-years to 5 lies with the people who make the claim. I don't think it is reasonable to simply provide an opinion (even if you are part of the 8-year-gang), if you are on the side of changing the entire system, if you are not willing to provide substantive arguments for those changes. Keep in mind that there are people (not me) who have staked 10k+ ICP with the understanding that they are in this for the long hall.

There is no way to anticipate what people plan to do in terms of staking and dissolving.

And there is no "early". We already have neuron marketplaces now, and it will become even easier to transfer neurons in the coming months. I wouldn't be surprised if someone creates a wrapped neuron token and ledger canister to be honest.

I ran this poll in mid-March (before the neuron restriction changes were proposed). Having neuron marketplaces is overwhelmingly influencing ICP holders' decision to stake funds for a longer period of time.

![Screenshot 2024-05-06 at 15.42.00|600x307](upload://zWHQStRlRDqss90TxQp4v2doeEZ.png)

We can pretend these secondary effects don't exist, but there have already been others in this thread mentioning the immediate rush to create said 8-year neurons before the change is implemented. Being able to both create a "bonused" neuron & then sell it later on a neuron marketplace (after collecting rewards for awhile) is getting to ["have your cake and eat it too"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/have%20one%27s%20cake%20and%20eat%20it%20too).

I believe newcomers to the ICP ecosystem would see this system as unfair as well.

There's also the simplicity of the absolute solution without exceptions. How is this system maintained if the NNS wants to change tokenomics yet again in the future, but maybe lower the maximum to 4 years? Are the 5 year holders now second-level OGs?

I think this makes my earlier point quite clear about how this proposal change is flipping the tables on short-term vs. long-term thinking for stakers.

And in this case, I believe most 8-year neuron holders thinking with short-term interests in mind. It's not a bad thing to be profit driven, I'm a capitalist myself. I purely feel many of the 8-year stakers are looking at their short-term APY and not looking at the serious inflation issues the network and ecosystem are facing, especially given the current imbalance against ICP -> cycle burn (which will come in time as computation increases on ICP).

-------------------------

CA1 | 2024-05-06 23:08:57 UTC | #170

I never said that the secondary effects don’t exist, IDGeek is definitely a thing, and you could argue that it is potentially a problem.

BUT

These are early days, we are all early adopters, and we should be rewarded for it.
The solution I think most people actually want in terms of grandfathering would create a very finite supply of 8-year-neurons in long-term, and with wallets increasing globally the number of grandfathered neurons would always be decreasing. Obviously we could argue inflation numbers all day, but again, you are making the positive claim to change the system, and there are other ways to deal with inflation besides slicing the 8 year cap.

EDIT: To be clear: I am not even against adjusting the APY to combat inflation, if this is done correctly. If for instance the APY is rescaled so that only the 8-year-neurons get what the 5-year neurons currently get. My principal issue is that you are gutting some long-term investors (mainly the 8-year-gang) in the proces.

-------------------------

AmSpeed | 2024-05-06 23:05:43 UTC | #171

I agree with this. The APY will only go down by like 3% that’s not bad at all! Even if your 10k ICP turns to 8k ICP, wouldn’t it be better to have a 8k ICP that’s worth 8 million than a 10k ICP that’s worth 1 million because if inflation?

This proposal will:
Reduce inflation significantly, increase the price of ICP which will reduce the amount of ICP minted for node provider rewards and to top it off, AI requires a lot of computational power which will burn a lot of cycles hence further increasing. That’s not even taking into account the enterprise adoption or any other adoption. 

We have to zoom out a little to see the big picture.

I’d say keep the initial proposal.

-------------------------

tcpim | 2024-05-06 23:09:51 UTC | #172

One benefit to give stakers time to think and decide is that many people with with < 5 years neurons may increase the dissolve delay from <5 years to >5 years to lock in the benefits of higher rewards ratio that will never be seen again after the proposal kicks in. So, many new 8 year gangs will be created! Saying this because, I myself, am considering to increase one of my neurons to 8 years if this proposal is about to pass, to achieve higher rewards that no new stakers will be able to achieve in the future. 

I think this is another pros for this proposal, although this is a side effect

This is one of the things that the neuron age bonus already accounts for. If you've been staked since genesis, you already get a significant boost to both rewards and voting power.

Obviously we could argue inflation numbers all day, but again, you are making the positive claim to change the system, and there are other ways to deal with inflation besides slicing the 8 year cap.
[/quote]

Inflation is the primary driver for this proposal. The NNS can make one-off improvements like a periodic followee reset, but in the long term reducing rewards across the board (to Node Providers too) is the most sustainable solution.

Countries and currencies all around the world are dealing with inflation right now. It's painful, and the solutions usually require some short-term pain (interest rate hikes, etc.).

Okay then, so how do you feel about a grandfathering system, where all we do is rescale the APY so that the 8-year-gang gets the current max of 5-year, and everything inbetween scales linearly?

Heihachi | 2024-05-06 23:52:28 UTC | #176

For old 8 year gang stakers there should be an option whether to choose conversion to 5 year for their neuron or remain 8 year non dissolving stakers.

Keep in mind that the person who created this post, @dominicwilliams, probably has a longer-term ICP vision and more ICP staked in an 8-year neuron than the collective ICP of all posters in this thread combined.

You may feel rugged, but this affects him just as much (if not more than) any other 8-year staker.

ICP Inflation -> depressed price of ICP -> bad looking chart -> less investors -> node provider rewards inflation -> further ICP price depression.

FranHefner | 2024-05-07 00:32:57 UTC | #178

@dominicwilliams @aiv 

I believe both ideas can coexist together. If there is true trust in ICP, **why not add the option to 'Lock forever**'?

Then you would have half of the 8-year neurons transitioning to 5 years and half of the neurons opting to 'lock forever.' (We don't really know if it's exactly half, but let's consider this scenario).

So, all investment funds/big investors that are prohibited from locking their assets forever would transition to 5 years, and people like us who truly believe in ICP can lock them forever (maintaining the % reward).

Everything else, as Dom mentioned, would proportionally decrease from 5 years to 3 months in terms of reward percentages, thus reducing inflation.

Scale:
* 1-5 years (with reduced rewards)
* Locked forever (with the current rewards we deserve for locking it forever)

What do you think of this idea?
[poll type=regular results=always public=true chartType=bar]
* Good
* Bad

Hey @dominicwilliams thank you for starting this conversation and staying so actively engaged in it for so long.  There are some excellent points that have been made by many people and it is very interesting to see how several iterations on proposal 1 have evolved.  Personally, I'm not excited about reducing the dissolve delay by 5/8, but I'm willing to consider it.  Offering a one time option to leave a neuron at 8y or reduce it to 5y makes the idea more palatable.  I even like the further tweak that was discussed of giving people an extended time period to make the decision and it only reverts to 5yr if they don't make a selection.  That said, I also agree with the arguments that we shouldn't have a 2-tiered system between OGs and new neuron owners.  I like the idea of treating all neuron owners equally and I don't really want to create more drivers for neuron markets.  Hence, I'm still undecided on proposal 1 and look forward to seeing how the idea develops in the coming days.

Regarding proposal 2, I think it is a great idea and I would like to see it move forward.  I haven't really heard any arguments against it yet that would make me reconsider. 
 Proposal 2 seems like it would provide a lot of benefit to neuron owners and the ecosystem.

AmSpeed | 2024-05-07 00:52:22 UTC | #181

We should have a pole to kinda see where everyone’s head is at between keeping the initial proposal that Dom had plus what @LightningLad91 says (perhaps add an auto or manual restaking option to stake for another 3 years or even 5 after the initial 5 years for the OG 8 year gang that will build on top of the aging bonus?). 

OR

The edited version where only new stakers are affected. (I think this is a little half a***d)

antodugrenyc | 2024-05-07 00:52:41 UTC | #182

@dominicwilliams 

I am in for proposal 1. Think it could have the potential to significantly enhance profitability.

The reduction in token supply resulting from Proposal 1 will create a more balanced supply-demand dynamic, potentially driving up the market price of ICP tokens. Increased scarcity makes us more attractive to the market who are seeking assets with limited availability. With Proposal 1’s deflationary effect, coupled with the existing utility for services on ICP, I see it strengthening the network and hopefully instilling investor confidence.

I’m willing to sacrifice a bit in token rewards to potentially gain a lot more in token value. Let’s face it, having a lot of tokens is worthless if they hold little value.

-------------------------

ICPewPew | 2024-05-07 01:04:35 UTC | #183

I was also gonna say if it helps as well with inflation making it so that there is no auto stake feature with >5 Year neurons if its for the better of the eco. Maturity would be placed into a auto dissolve neuron and then you can either restaked into a 5 or less year neuron or do as you please with.

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-07 01:14:51 UTC | #184

Agree. It seems the "reduction of required staking" is supposed to be a benefit to justify lower rewards. Many of us staked max without plans of dissolving...at all. So to reduce the maturity rate of our neurons is a slap with no benefit.

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2024-05-07 01:21:43 UTC | #185

> 1. Reduce the dissolve delays of all neurons by 5/8th (to 62.5% of what they is today)

This is an absolutely wrong proposal that prioritizes collectivism over individual private property rights. We signed an 8-year NNS contract precisely because the value of locked neurons will be much higher than the ICP inflation in 8 years, believing in the long-term value of Dfinity and the ICP. Now, arbitrarily changing the 8-year lock-in to 5 years through a collectivist vote is a serious mistake, akin to Keynesianism. This logical error places equality above private property and trust, violating integrity.

However, I don't oppose community decisions on whether to limit new staked neurons to 5 years, as this pertains to new contracts.

Frankly speaking, DOM, you should focus more on driving the impact of the ICP on the real world, focusing on DeFi, stablecoins, and helping to promote more SNS projects to CoinBase, Binance, OKX, and other CEXs, even if it means expanding ICP's influence through meme marketing. Your focus is misplaced on tokenomics! Currently, all SNS projects have fallen below the price of ICP at the time of SNS, which is the biggest blow to the 8-year stakeholders, as the community is completely doubting the value of ICP and SNS.

All tokens on public chains, whether it's ETH, SOL, DOT, NEAR, or ICP, will not have any cash flow income in accounting terms. Including Dfinity, as a non-profit organization, it won't have any cash flow income either. Then, what's the point of public chain tokens? Besides being decentralized commodities and internet currencies, public chain tokens have no other value. If public chain tokens cannot become widely recognized commodities or internet currencies in the real world, then the public chain is a complete failure.

DOM, please don't evade the mission of ICP becoming a widely recognized commodity or internet currency. There are still many high-quality fiat currencies in the world: Pound CHF, GBP, EUR, JPY. For ICP to develop in the RWA and DeFi fields, it must face the competition from fiat currencies head-on, strive to face the free market, actively market itself, attract more stablecoins from around the world to come to ICP, only then will ICP have value. If blockchain cannot promote free trade, what's the point of blockchain protecting private data?

Since World War II, with the abolition of the gold standard to the present, fiat currency inflation has been severe, and centralized fiat currency systems have been harvesting individuals' savings and wealth. This is why BTC and ETH were born. If ICP is truly the third-generation blockchain, please don't prioritize collectivism over contract credibility, please don't make such foolish mistakes, uphold the value vision of BTC and ETH, integrate into the real world based on ETH DeFi's experience, develop more RWA and stablecoin assets. Only then will the third-generation blockchain network have value; otherwise, ICP is just a small toy for a few geeks.

No matter what you do someone’s gonna bitch. If someone is 8 years let them stay 8 years but let people have a choice to drop to 5. For new people no more 8 year gang it’s over that was for OGs.

Has anyone provided the math on the perceived impact this would have on price action? The percentage of maturity spawned by the targeted grouping? The effect to inflow of staked ICP?

Seems shortsighted to try to push through yet another tokenomics change within a day without providing the data & research. 

There have been many examples of alternative avenues to explore before reducing voting rewards yet again.

Why didn’t we see a headline like this when the APY was reduced by 50% the first time?

How many times do we take away voter rewards to compensate for other inefficient inflationary aspects of the network?

We’re continuously stripping the primary incentivize of users to stake ICP & vote to secure the NNS. What does this do to network security longterm?

All we can do is suggest. Put it on the NNS. And let the people vote. That’s the purpose of the DAO. I’m not against what you’re saying. The only reason why I went to 8 years is because my ledger was compromised and I have no way of removing the ledger from my neuron.

-------------------------

Snap | 2024-05-07 02:02:19 UTC | #195

Yeah... so idk how this topic came up in the first place? Far and away the most ideal thing to happen is for more projects to burn more cycles. Realistically speaking this is not a difficult task. If just a couple of devs create certain tools, ones centered around video hosting, streaming, LLMs, basically out of the box ready to go tools for high bandwith activities like video rendering etc. etc. Sort of along the lines of those free editor tools people use all the time on web pages... automatically the amount of Cycles burning, would significantly go up. Even if Divinity or another organization were not to set up open use high bandwidth tools for public use. Just having those options alone would give people a nice toolbox to work with When developing their own dapps...  not to mention these could be tools available to the public with a coin operated machine style approach..  insert Cycles to acomplish X.... heck this approach could even make some decent money for the original developer if you charge a small % on the cycles used...

I don't know who pointed at the inflation of ICP and thought this is a bad thing, but shame on whoever you are. Icp's inflation isn't even as bad as a lot of other projects/coin/chains. Ultimately I don't even see this as a problem long-term considering the long-term goal is literally for it to become a deflationary coin... anyways as more people adopt ICP the metrics will change organically on their own. Why are we looking to flip the table?!

That being said I am part of the eight-year gang from way higher than the vast majoroty of people here i bought on day 1  all the way to the bottom... and I don't earn as much on a daily basis as some of the other people here, but anybody who's looking to change a perfectly acceptable system for tax reasons shame on you.. get your counterparty nonsense out of my risks profile... Stop trying to change the game on me... i invested and locked up more or less forever because of the original agreement. When i finally started staking a couple years ago, i did it with no intention to ever unlock, so the number of years it takes... is not really all that relevant to me.. but anybody who's looking at ICP shorter term.. why do you even care to  cater to this person in the first place? Everybody saying "8 years is too long!" Okay. Dont do it then... nobody's thretting you with violance and making you do anything... dont stake.. problem solved.

-------------------------

AmSpeed | 2024-05-07 02:12:15 UTC | #196

Good points. Making ICP deflationary will be more of a benefit for 8 year gang than letting the APY stay the same or even increasing it. It’s a fight between more tokens vs less VALUABLE tokens.

Again do we want 10k tokens valued at 1 million or 5k tokens valued at 5 million. This is the debate right now.

I say since we’re discussing tokenomics, I’d like to see the impact in numbers/the rate of inflation reduction on @dominicwilliams first proposal. Will it make ICP deflationary or simply reduce inflation?

If it only reduces inflation, what would it take to make ICP deflationary now.

ajismyid | 2024-05-07 02:16:11 UTC | #197

[quote="aiv, post:43, topic:30352"]
feel like a DAO should generally keep its promises. As long as existing 8 year neurons remain with the same dissolve delay and reward rate but new neurons could only stake up to 5 years, then all prior promises from the NNS to its users would be kept. In that case, I think there would be a generally strong amount of community support around both of these proposals.

The sensitive thing here is making sure confidence stays strong that governance rewards (and tokenomics in general) will remain fairly stable and not leave people feeling rugged.

Someone should be able to stake ICP, set it to follow a known neuron they trust, and then come back in 5 years with no surprises waiting for them. If that’s not the case, a lot of people won’t be as eager to stake because they’ll feel that rules might be changed at any time from under them.

Also, while inflation is important I also see a lot of value in having as much ICP as possible remaining locked into the NNS.
[/quote]

@dominicwilliams I agree with @aiv's opinion. NNS DAO must keep its promise to the stakers until the  contract is honored. We shouldn't change the contract in the middle halfway, because it's not fair.

Here's my thought:

1. First is to set the maximum staking for **new neurons** to no more than 5 years.
2. Second is to change the 8-year neuron, to only be **valid for 8 years from the time the neuron was created**, and then when the 8 year time contract is honored, it will automatically **follow to 5 years max staking**. For example, if a staker staked an 8-year neuron since the genesis year 2021, then the maximum staking neuron will only be valid until 2029. After that, the neuron will automatically change to a 5-year staking neuron."

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2024-05-07 02:25:29 UTC | #198

The spirit of blockchain lies in contract credibility and the immutability of contracts. The important issue is not whether the 8-year lock-in period is willing to be changed to 5 years, but rather whether as neuron holders, the 8-year stakeholders have the right to reject new governance and maintain the original contract. This is a matter of free to choice.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-05-07 02:59:12 UTC | #199

I'm a skeptic that ICP will become deflationary with cycles burn in the near future, in my opinion it may never be achieved (I hope I'm wrong), considering the intense competition in the cloud service industry. 

Reducing inflation by reducing rewards for governance participants may only help give temporary breathing space for the ICP. 

But in the near or medium term, I'm more convinced that ICP could become scarce tokens due to the increasing need for protocol governance and SNS, rather than the scarcity effect of deflation caused by cycles burn.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-07 03:03:07 UTC | #200

The faster we become deflationary the better. What if Dfinity burned half their stake?

-------------------------

Archetypal | 2024-05-07 05:09:43 UTC | #203

I'm going to say no on the initial proposal, simply because I chose back in 2021 to lock for 8 years and never planned to dissolve, instead preferring to have the passive income in the future. Do not want my rewards slashed then have to go and buy more to hit my targeted ICP/day amount. Especially now the price has recovered somewhat.

Grandfathering might be okay, but I'd need to see some data on how that would affect Dfinity's voting power from followers. Ultimately we need to be trending over time toward Dfinity having less voting power, with more allocated toward independent neurons. If grandfathering would mean Dfinity ends up with MORE voting power after the change, then that presents a major issue.

This would probably be too hard to calculate since there's no way to know which neuron holders would choose to remain at 8 years or switch to 5. And who each neuron follows. However, if coupled with the followee reset that was voted on and approved AGES ago but still not implemented, then it might be okay.

kusiyo | 2024-05-07 05:09:51 UTC | #204

The more I think about it, the worse it gets.
Locally reducing the inflation rate, while globally reducing the stability of the mechanism.
Maybe one day when the 8-year gang becomes a minority of the community, people can just directly deprive the 8-year gang of all their maturity by simply making a proposal.

In my situation, I have no issues what so ever, I initially bought my ICP at 450 USD each, went almost broke until I was hired for some freelance work at CDC and then bought a Ledger Nano S Plus, and then was when I withdrew my ICP from Binance and finally staked them for 8 years.

In addition, maybe adding functionality to dissolve ICP neurons earlier [ where the maturity is cut off proportionally can be ideal as well.

DHemingway | 2024-05-07 06:38:42 UTC | #210

I like the minimum dissolve delay being reduced to 3-months in the proposal. My ideal minimum dissolve delay is and would be 30-days as I believe that would get greater adoption and continue to decentralize the IC DAO further and get maximum participation from ICP token holders in governance.

I wonder if reducing the maximum dissolve delay from 8 to 5 years would change peoples mindset regarding maturity, instead of leaving maturity in an unstaked state maybe the change might lead to increased maturity staking. 

Down side of this, check boxes and opt-in to reductions, my child has an 18-year outlook for their ICP holdings in their neuron, obviously 8-year dissolve delay now, why not create a sliding scale from 30-days to infinity for dissolve delay, recalculating the rewards everyday based on what is locked up. A sliding scale could keep inflation status quo perhaps, but also take ICP off the market and locked up for such a long period of time, it’d be almost like burning it. We saw that the old SNS-1 now DKP neurons locked for 888 years in some cases really affected supply/demand and if this dissolve delay reduction proposal is about reducing inflation then aren’t we just talking about ICP price here at its core and supply/demand? 
Maybe we should do both… increase maximum dissolve delay and decrease minimum dissolve delay while paying rewards on a sliding scale based on what is staked if that is possible.

-------------------------

EpicICP | 2024-05-07 06:47:45 UTC | #211

If you want to fix the inflation problem, the right thing to do is to limit voting rewards to less than or equal to the amount of ICP burned (i.e. converted to cycles, or cycles burned) on a daily basis.

Tinkering with the staking parameters just causes frustration, and will ultimately lead us right back here to change them again in the future.

I vote NO on both proposals since they don't solve the problem (though I do like the 3-month to 5-year range).

Let's solve the problem now before the hedonistic masses infiltrate ICP (i.e. Wall Street). Distribute rewards in proportion to staking interval and age bonus; but only distribute what the network actually earns in revenues!

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-05-07 07:00:02 UTC | #212

These are all good points.

If it becomes possible to withdraw staked icp, do you think it would be a good idea to expose unstaked maturity at the aggregate level so folks can see it on the dashboard? 

In order to get liquidity, many folks will opt to withdraw their staked icp rather than convert maturity. As a result, maturity will build up. 

If this is not publically exposed, the amount of “overhang” or “potential inflation” in the form of unstaked maturity will be a complete mystery. Many years down the road when there are huge amounts of unstaked maturity there could be years of large inflation. 

It would be good I think for folks to see the unstaked maturity on the dashboard no?

Solving inflation requires rapid economic growth, attracting more small and medium-sized enterprises to develop on ICP, and bringing in more users. The US dollar has been experiencing inflation for the past 80 years, with its value against gold depreciating nearly 40 times. But have people in the US market been endlessly discussing their statistical or algorithmic problems? No! The period of rapid economic growth in the United States happened to be the freest time for Silicon Valley entrepreneurship in the 1970s-1990s. ICP should follow suit. Stop endlessly discussing ridiculous algorithmic distributions and instead accelerate ICP's adoption in real-world scenarios, attract more developers, and bring in more stablecoins and RWA assets to ICP. Only then will this blockchain network have economic value. Don't deviate from your mission. 

Essentially, ICP has only two functions: as a governance token and as computational demand to be consumed. Whichever demand it is, it forces ICP to become a valuable commodity in the market as soon as possible.

Currently the real inflation (disbursed maturity) is less than 5% per year. I don't see any reason to change the tokenomics. The dumping comes from VC and this will end April next year when the last unlock happened.

Further a small inflation helps to decentralize wealth. A big issue of Bitcoin for instance.

And currently holders are incentiviced to commit long term. A change would affect that negatively. So no, not good.

jonit | 2024-05-07 08:08:45 UTC | #221

Won't reducing the max staking time for 8-5 years potentially increase the amount of ICP on the market not reduce it? This is potentially because it will reach the market quicker. I think a few scenarios need to be modelled. People often lock up to force themselves not to sell as they know they may have slippery hands in a strong market. So there is a potential for this to have the inverse to the expect result if its not modelled accurately.

renem | 2024-05-07 08:19:48 UTC | #222

You need to burn a bit more than 110,000 ICP per day to become stagnat and then deflationary.

I see a lot of angry people on here. This is just a discussion, we need to calm down, remove emotions, think about how we can improve the IC network and look at the bigger picture. 

I trust @dominicwilliams has good intentions. I’d like to see the impact proposal 1 has on inflation. Does it make IC completely deflationary? If not, I’m sure most of us would like to know what it will take to make it deflationary now.

Seems some people are too focused on the amount of tokens they get rather than the value of the tokens they get. Remember the high the price of ICP tokens, the less tokens get minted for node provider rewards (keep this in mind if you didn’t consider it).

I’d be down for even a 10% APY for 5 years if it makes $ICP deflationary now.

Most of us are staked for 8 years including Dom and a -3% APY is nothing at all.

Couldn’t we cap the amount of icp a neuron can get from the current apy E.G the cap would be 10k ICP everything above that amount get split into a lower APY neuron (5 years reward) and all new created neurons would follow up on this low APY too For people who have larger neuron now could still split their neurons before the changes are implemented…

I am really having trouble supporting this because the proposal [Proposal: 55651 - ICP Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) was voted on and adopted and was neglected and not implemented on by dfinity

I disagree; that would be the case if someone else made the necessary code changes and was then prevented from applying them.

That is exactly what I asked (about modelizations) for the same reason. But I guess I won't have any answer...

I feel this could be something similar to voting in real life, where voting is done every 4-5 years. We can set a vote every single year at a fixed date.

Can we have some form of unstaking penalty for users that want to unlock quickly. We can burn these coins to reduce inflation.

If you don't sell your rewards it doesn't make a difference if you get less rewards with an priced-in increase of the price or more rewards and a slightly lower price due to higher inflation. Inflation is not bad per se especially if it is a low inflation. It's a complete misunderstanding in crypto that an asset is better only because it is not inflationary.

The goal of the proposal is to achieve higher price/popularity/adoption. But decreasing reward inflation is not helping much and has other negative consequences eliminating the hoped positive price action short terms as well as long term.

What if Scott burned half of his stake? :sweat_smile:

I have 14,360 ICP in 8yr non dissolving neurons.

This is what I think needs to happen.

Leave current neurons exactly as they are and lock any increase.

Set the new max to one year.

Get rid of the minimum spawn size.

Uncap the age bonus from 4 years to unlimited.

Create and distribute ICP equal to the burn rate for voting rewards.

The inflation problem has gone away.

As the network is used more, the rewards will increase, use the same percentages as the neurons have now.

The price will rise drastically as there is next to no sell pressure.

Node providers are paid in fiat (which is converted to ICP) so node provider inflation will reduce significantly as the price of ICP raises.

Offer a window where anyone who has staked can unstake locked neurons (I don’t think 8yr would as they’ll only get 1 year if they change their mind and want to stake again).

I predict price would rise astronomically, news and exposure would increase, more usage, more cycles burnt, more rewards.
