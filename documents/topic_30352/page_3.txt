Security needs to be audited by external auditing companies. The same for tokenomics. Still my question is that is there even a real economist at dfinity?

-------------------------

dao1 | 2024-05-08 15:35:07 UTC | #347

We need thorough economics modelling and simulations that have solid foundation and are economically and mathematically convincing. Not just random decisions by some “genius” minds.

Take a long-term view, there is no shortage of investment in good projects. I think it's best to eliminate the hidden dangers in the early stage, if it develops to the scale of ETH, it will be difficult to change many drawbacks, because it will touch the interests of more people. Only with a good architecture will there be no difficulty in changing and increasing the price of tokens like ETH.IC is a goal with a big vision, and some major decision-making changes must be made in the development to benefit the future development, otherwise after the real development, it will be like ETH, and no major changes can be made. I hope you can come up with the perfect solution and don’t leave trouble for future development.

[quote="KennyBoyNYC, post:342, topic:30352"]
aybe we should consider giving a choice to those who already have an 8 year nueron if they want to reduce or not and, if not, keeping those rewards as they have been and, going forward only offer max 5 years.
[/quote]

@KennyBoyNYC fwiw

the udpated version of the idea Dom posted says that:

> **the proposal was modified so that 8 Year neurons would NOT be forcibly reduced into 5 Year neurons (and in fact, would have some adjustability too). In the modified proposal, it would only become impossible to set dissolve delays >5Y in the FUTURE, and delays on existing neurons would only be brought down if their owners wished (at their choice).**

(see the top original forum post)

Dom modified the original post because there are too many comments to reply to

SamurajSelfieSam | 2024-05-08 17:39:14 UTC | #350

> The problem with allowing top-ups is that someone could buy a neuron with 1 ICP (EDIT: that was already staked for 8 years) and add 999 to it and suddenly have circumvented the entire “8-year-gang” concept.

Yes. I have actually been farming 'low allocation eight years neurons' in the eventuality of one day be able to sell them at a premium. 

(Not sure if that ever made any sense, given there are also the possibilities of dividing a neuron)

What if the reduction in time is compensated with the amount of ICP that will give us the same ICP rewards with a lower %  so if you have 1000 ICP  at 8 years, Then you will have 1200 ICP at 5 years. I think that would be fair.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-08 23:24:11 UTC | #353

Was that grandfather clause in the original proposal, or only after investors protested? 

It wasn't it in the original, it was backpedaling. There is nothing from stopping a proposal like this again in the future, so we need to make it clear it is not acceptable. 

Consider getting a mortgage/rental, you've done the figures and it works for you. 

But after you locked in, the bank/landlord changes their mind and decides to double your repayments. Would you be happy about this?

A Proposal as the Fundamental Principle for the Evolution of ICP Tokenomics:
    
*Every time the tokenomics is changed by the DAO, everyone should be given a chance to freely change their current staking state.*

According to this principle, if Proposal 1 of @dominicwilliams is accepted, then everyone should be given one chance to freely change his neuron (with whatever dissolve delay, whether 1- or 8-year) into a 3-month neuron (or with any other delay).

I know this principle is pretty strict at first glance, but it is the only principle that can guarantee the long-term stability of the evolvable tokenomics. 

In fact, it will make the NNS more decentralized. Note that Democracy is not Decentralization, since democracy can lead to the tyranny of the majority: If the voting result is against you, you have no way out but accept it even if it hurts you a lot.

However, if we accept the above fundamental principle, then under the NNS DAO, for the first time throughout human history as far as I know, we can have a really Decentralized Democracy:

*You can just go away if the voting result is against you too much.*

That is a really wonderful social choice rule, suggesting the huge potential of what a DAO can do comparing to the so rekt democracy of the real world (even emigration is not always optional for some people in the real world).

Claim: All of my crypto investment are in BTC, ETH, and ICP, and 80% of my crypto assets are in ICP with 8-year delay (automatic compounding and non-dissolving), but I will not change my staking state if possible. I propose this thought experiment not for myself, but for those who may have different plans. I hope our ICP community will become a really nice community, not a community in which everyone always tries hard to get more from others.

-------------------------

adamracks | 2024-05-08 23:33:10 UTC | #355

So I truly believe the original proposal is horrible and the updated version is also horrible.

Changing up the staking terms that investors agreed to when staking is going to make them lose confidence in the project and want to take their hard earned money elsewhere to a project that will honor its commitments to the community.

Grandfathering in "OG" eight year neurons is going to be absolutely devastating when it comes to attracting new investors and growing the community. I get the idea of "early adopters should be rewarded" but this is just going make potential new investors/community members feel that they are not early and that their votes won't count as much as the 8 year elites. They are going to think that they missed the ICP boat and that the Xfinity ship has sailed. They will gravitate toward some shiny new project where they have a chance at being early because that's what crypto teaches us is important: to be early. This update proposal is reinforcing that idea.
 
Creating a tiered system where new and newer participants are progressively rewarded less and less, punishing them for not being early enough is no way for a decentralized, democratized internet to operate. All participants should stand on equal footing. Please do not create a divided class system within the protocol @dominicwilliams

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-08 23:38:26 UTC | #356

@dominicwilliams 
Perhaps if you're worried about controlling inflation. Start a proper marketing team within dfinity and start going after companies to migrate across. 

Continue the organic marketing to developers, but actively market to form new partnerships with companies like Shopify (for example). 
I know they have commitments already that was just an example.
Wouldn't this also keep down inflation?

If ICP is ready to scale, are you actively marketing your product to onboard new business/government systems?
Purely from a cybercrime and costs perspective, I don't know why government contracts aren't being sought.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-08 23:52:33 UTC | #357

Really, they haven't even put this proposal forward on Twitter/X? 

That just shows, it's very sneaky.
They absolutely don't want the investors to know about it. 

Yes they may have backpedalled on it, but it doesn't change that it's what they wanted to do to begin with. 

I personally was such a strong advocate to other people for how ICP is different, it's a great long term investment etc.

Knowing this is even a possibility, my faith in this project has changed overnight.

-------------------------

adamracks | 2024-05-08 23:54:44 UTC | #358

It's funny that nobody is mentioning reducing the incentives for short term stakers. Read thru the entire thread and only @Accumulating.icp brought it up and maybe one other person. Someone locking for six months gets half of the rewards as someone locked for 96 months non-dissolving? How does this make sense? And now we want to give rewards out to 90 day lettuce hands. Why?

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 00:06:40 UTC | #359

Yeah totally agree. 
Long term stakers are taking the biggest risk, so they should see the biggest rewards. It seems they've used the 8 year stakers to set a stable base for the price, now want to flip it so more people short term stake to drive the price. I'm happy to be proven wrong.

But if they are having issues with inflation, they need to begin marketing to business.

I personally also think that only those who acquired ICP after the public offering should be allowed to vote on this, if we actually want to keep the vote free from manipulation. 

Neuron followed votes should not be counted either, as people who aren't aware of this, may be following a neuron with different intentions to their own. 

This whole thing is sneaky.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-09 00:59:29 UTC | #360

Any people here remember when @dominicwilliams proposed the 5% modulation up or down for minting rewards?  That was supposed to reduce selling pressure of the rewards while the market was going down.  The proposal barely passed.  If it wasn't a Dominic's proposal, I have serious doubt it would have passed.  Wellll, because of the bear market, the ICP price went from 20$ to 2.87$.  The modulation was a complete fail at his task.  This is what happen when you throw a proposal out there, an idea without any serious study or analysis to support.

Now, imagine (even with the proposal update),  if we get in another bear market and during that difficult time, the price goes from 12 to 3$, and I can only restake my rewards to a maximum for 5 years and getting only 62.5% of what I could get if we reject the proposal.  Would make that bear market so much more difficult.  For me, I would not re-stake at 10% or so, and would stop to re-stake my rewards.  So the price would tank by 75% in few months and, if stake for 5 years, your new rewards would give you back 10% per year.

I would sell and invest in traditional market when some Preferred shares are giving you an easy 8-10%, without all the risk (way less anyway) and unstability of crypto.

I am convince that the rewards are not the problem for the sell pressure as the majority of 8 years stakers are re-staking.   Good chances the selling pressure come from all those who had their neurons unlocked every month for the last 3 years, which, until this month, were millions per month.

[/quote]

Quite frankly, I’m not sure you are aware how this is the norm for proposals. Most if not all topics start as conversations in dev forum where people post ideas, get deep feedback beyind what twitter is good at, iterate, bake the idea some more, try again, bake some more and increasingly how vocal one is. 

With all due respect, maybe you are not aware of the dozens of times this has been the normal case.

This is actually very standard. Many at dfinity and outside have done this many times. Across many topics, yes even tokenimics. After all this is a very active and public forum.

**Personal note**: *I’m  increasingly frustrated with the notion that the good practice of sharing one’s thoughts publicly, getting feedback to see the holes, and seeing how one feels about them is bad. Not everything needs to be shouted or marketed. It is reasonable for someone to say “I have some thoughts, I’d like to get some feedback to see how good the idea is or how I feel about it or if it’s worth making a deeper proposal.”*

I think the intellectual honesty and humility of presenting thoughts, listening, and answering questions … with some reservation to market one’s ideas but actually listen… I think this is a healthy practice we should promote not disdain.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 01:36:09 UTC | #362

I might be wrong but I believe it's the way the term yield etc is defined. 
In Australia when I created an 8 year neuron the annualised return was 8% for an 8 year neuron. 
I think (don't quote me) but I think some countries define the term differently, so that may be the reason why. 
Clarification on this point would need to come from the team as I'm only summising. 

But I have noticed the same thing you mentioned.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 01:50:34 UTC | #363

I am not new to investing, but I am newish to investing in crypto. 

I've never made an investment (besides ICP) in which the fundamental reason why I invested is up for change, where the outcome is out of my hands. 

I think it's incredibly sneaky and I don't see how this could possibly comply with any regulations. 

Take my previous point. 
If you commited to a mortgage and the bank decided to propose doubling your repayments, just like that. 
You don't control the majority of votes so effectively the vote is out of your control. 
If this went ahead and your mortgage payments doubled, it could easily offset any capital appreciation in the property and the reason you invested to begin with. 

Keep in mind a lot of people who have invested in an 8 year neuron, have done so for the long term investment. 
That money we locked away, could have been used to make better short term gains in the crypto market. 
We missed those other investment opportunities because we locked into ICP. Can you understand this from an investor point of view?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-09 01:59:08 UTC | #364

In the next 4 years, the rewards will go from 6.95% (as of now) to 5% of the total ICP. 
This mean the 15.2% for 8 years stakers will be 10.94%.
With the new proposal, staking for 5 years, it will be 6.78%.
Any interest to stake for 5 years at 6.78% PA?  So much worst for the 1 or 2 years stakers who would have 3% or so.
Who would do that?
I won't.
it would create the exact opposite of what is needed.  No more rewards staking and everyone will sell their rewards.  Good chances for many to unlock their neurons as well.

My final word:  I strongly believe this is a very, extremely bad proposal for both the network and all.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2024-05-09 02:18:54 UTC | #365

You are aware that you don’t have a contract with anyone for having the privilege to participate in the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations governance and receiving rewards for doing so, or not participating and not receiving rewards? 

Are you also aware that with less inflation the price of ICP could also be positively impacted. 

Are you also aware 99% of your comments are ill conceived?

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 02:22:45 UTC | #366

Further to my last. 
I know you say to get the proposal out there and get some feedback etc is common, I completely understand that from a development side of things. 

We're talking about impacting investments people have made and changing the fundamentals of an investment. Nothing to do with the software development side of things. 

Which is why this proposal doesn't belong on a developer forum to begin with.
Is this proposal on twitter?

Because if you want feedback from the investment community (not just the developers), this needs to be on an actual community forum. 

This has been mentioned by a few people in this thread, but was this proposal put together by someone who understands the implications to investors?

-------------------------

diegop | 2024-05-09 02:29:59 UTC | #367

[quote="Mpeiz, post:363, topic:30352"]

[/quote]

I certainly can understand your concerns about *the proposal.*  I have no qualms with any of these.  Im still reading and absorbing all. As I said up 100 comments ago (lol), I’m an 8 year staker and I also don’t know how I feel about the proposal itself (both original and modified version.)

Where I disagree with you is that while I see it a healthy  that someone made  public proposals, listens to feedback, tries to get support, and bakes their thoughts, you seem to think this is a bad thing. I think it’s important for design conversations to be intellectually honest about what needs to be thought of and where people need feedback.

You can agree/disagree with the proposal. That is fair by me. Many people have different ideas. That’s fair.

I don’t think it’s fair to say this is sneaky to post one’s thoughts asking for feedback. Indeed, it’s one of the reasons I started and have moderated this forum for 4 years. I wanted to see a place where serious discussions could take.


Does that sound reasonable?

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 02:26:38 UTC | #368

You don't consider it a contract? 

Many people have locked away substantial amounts of their money in an investment. Owning ICP is to participate in the governance. 

It's not a privilege, I paid for it.

-------------------------

adamracks | 2024-05-09 02:29:36 UTC | #369

It's not 100% certain that reducing inflation will make price go up. True if demand stays the same and supply decreases then price will go up. But what if this proposal causes demand to decrease because there is less incentive to accumulate and stake. Supply and demand may both decrease and price could remain stagnant or even drop. The future is unknown.

The future is unknown. However I do know that I would stop buying ICP every time I get paid if the future rewards to not match my ROI expectations. Perhaps I'm not the only one who would feel this way?

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 02:33:42 UTC | #370

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. 
As am I. 
I respect that everyone can have an opinion.

I don't agree with the way this has been done. 

As I said, if you are looking for feedback, why is this being put on a developer forum? 
Surely you know most investors aren't on here.

If this proposal is already on twitter etc can you please share the link. 

If it's not, my question is why not? 

If it's not shared with the entire ICP community (outside of development teams) then I stand by my statement that yes this is sneaky. 

We don't have to agree. But that is my opinion.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 02:54:13 UTC | #372

Hey man, to be honest I don’t think smart investors and wealthy investors based their decisions on crypto twitter, look at me here, following the discussion, and I just have invested 100.000 USD, is not small amount but not a lot like ones investing millions, if you care about your investment you must be following everything about the project, not on crypto twitter.


While I agree the % of rewards should remain the same as I based my investment plan on it, and now the proposal would affect that plan, (but NOT now according to the modification @dominicwilliams said) 

I understand the proposal aims to benefit the project economics and not affect it, but I don’t see to much issue anyway with keeping the 8year % rewards to a few early investors and believers, while new users and investors be adapted to the new proposal rewards. 

I’m not sure about having the option to keep the 8year neuron or change it to 5 year @dominicwilliams  I think everyone should stay attached to 8year, are you planning go to 5 year? 🤨😅😅

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 02:55:42 UTC | #373

@8yearNeuron I agree 💯 

This proposal also needs to be put on other channels where investors will see it. 

The dfinity team absolutely know that the majority of investors are not on the development forum. They're choosing where they're "looking for feedback". 

It doesn't sit well with me the way this has been done.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 03:05:50 UTC | #374

How do you feel about the modified? I think it’s the right path to go, early investors be respected their investment plans, new investors have to base new investments plans according to the new rewards, the only thing i see is probably don’t have the option to go to 5 year or stay at 8, why give the “benefit” to go to 5year, I mean how does the protocol benefits from this decision? Because this people now receive less rewards because now they are on a 5year neuron? Or as joke I said dom is planning go to 5 year 😅🙃😂

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 03:08:03 UTC | #375

Lol I wouldn't consider the majority of crypto to be smart investment. The fact billions flow through meme coins blows my mind. 

ICP was supposed to be working with regulatory bodies, so perhaps I assumed too much when thinking ICP was different.

I did think it was a great and undervalued investment. But am I naive for assuming the tokenomics could not be changed, when I am locking away a significant amount of money for 8+ years? 

If this is on me, then what about all the other investors? Is this on them too?

I think the fact I'm on here being vocal means I am keeping track of my investment outside of twitter. I'm talking about those who don't.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 03:17:44 UTC | #376

To clarify, I'm not completely opposed to changing things going forward if the change is necessary and people are aware of what they are signing up for. 

As long as those of us who did invest based on a clearly defined ROI etc are given the option to be grandfathered in, then it doesn't affect me. 

However, I also agree with other comments that this may divide the community. 

I would like to know how many other options were discussed before this one was proposed. 
As a division in the community (which this proposal is already doing) is not what ICP needs. 
If there is no other choice, then fine. 
But for people who locked away their money based on an agreed ROI, I absolutely consider it something that cannot be changed for those already locked in. 

I think other options (like onboarding bigger companies to ICP) should be explored first to control inflation rather than this proposal.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-09 03:20:26 UTC | #377

Don't forget, in few years, the 5 years staking will reward about 6.78%, when total rewards goes down from 6.95% to 5% of the supply.  Would you stake, freeze your asset, for 5 years in return of 6.78%?  1 year at about 3%?

Even the 8 years at 15.2% now, will be at about 10 or 11% when we reach the 5% of supply level.  This is the minimum that can be interesting for an investor.

No body will stake anymore.  Everyone receiving rewards will sell their rewards and invest somewhere else.  We need to look a little forward too.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 03:20:43 UTC | #378

ICP has had enough bad coverage over the years (through no fault of its own), I honestly think this is the last thing it needs when finally gaining some traction.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 03:20:55 UTC | #379

Why you keep going, aren’t you listening that 8year neurons will remain the same, why keep complaining? I was complaining till @dominicwilliams  modified it, I agree and most of people agree, so why keep going?

Smart investors and wealthy investors never based their decisions on crypto twitter don’t be naive, and sorry but that’s ignorant to think someone investing millions is not aware now about this proposal because is not on dominic william twitter. 

And yes sadly stupid retail are the ones that always lose and get hurt, (knowledge is power) while a lot of people were here stopping and re modifying the proposal they were on crypto twitter crying doing nothing, as dominic was talking here not there.. basically we did their job, arguing in the right place, 

now what we need is to make this people get the news, so hopefully they at least vote in the right way, NOT AGAINST the proposal 🙃🙃.

@Accumulating.icp  @Scottsummersicp  please spread the word on twitter with the modified proposal thanks, and for accumulating stop spreading fear and share the news.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 03:27:02 UTC | #380

You don't think the combined investments of smaller amounts don't equal the same in voting power as one individual with a larger investment? 

No, I don't believe that large amounts of people who are only invested a couple hundred or a couple thousand dollars are this active on understanding proposals like this. 

Happy to be proven wrong.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 03:28:37 UTC | #381

My neuron according to my stats will be no less than 14% with age bonus, 14% of millions USD, that’s a huge ROI from my original investment of 100k, this are the benefits of early investors, let’s see future investors, ICP has real utility as we all know ( I suppose everyone understands this) so basically will be a huge demand and a limited inflation (5%) when becomes deflationary every investor will start to see ICP as a stock company looking for it anual revenue, 4% is not to much, but as price fluctuates and will be higher due to demand every year that 4% will be more and more according to that initial investment, if you invested 10k in the future, and at 4%  anual, next year those 10k can be 20k, now you do 4% of 20k, basically now you get 8% from original investment (10k)

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 03:31:10 UTC | #382

Probably yes, that’s why we now need to spread the the word on twitter, youtube influencers and everyone with followers, but now that we already modified it. So people understand.

Anyway always read the proposal before adopting or rejecting it.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 03:36:23 UTC | #385

Yeah, I've asked if they could cover this new proposal in new videos. 
Hopefully they do. 

But I still think other options need to be looked at first, as this will divide the community. 

Look, if being grandfathered in then I'm set, just like you. 
But that doesn't mean I think this is the best long term for ICP (creating a divide).

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-09 03:42:16 UTC | #386

I created my neuron June 2021.  I have 17.4% actually.  Going from 6.95 to 5% is a 28% cut.  So the best my neuron will be is 12%.  Not sure how you figure the 14%?  I hope I am wrong on this one and will get 14% too.
But this is not my point.  My point is that no new investors will stake anymore.  So what will happen with the price?  Certainly not help.
I agree and I am confident that the blcokchain will be a success and demand may surpass the supply, as it was showed last year by @bjoernek 
If this the case, then why changing the rewards for such low return for new stakers and be at extreme high risk of eliminating them all completely?
This is my point.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-09 03:53:12 UTC | #387

@dominicwilliams we should have the option to adjust our neuron to any time frame then. Some may want to go from 8 years to 6 months. As a one time courtesy to everyone. Mines obviously on non dissolve but to each there own

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-09 04:02:06 UTC | #388

What about the risk that 25 or 50 millions, maybe more, of ICP coming on the market at the same time, when the 6 months expire?
You may think this will not happen but it could.  Huge risk to me.

-------------------------

GSWfan | 2024-05-09 04:02:11 UTC | #389

Reducing the neuron lock time from 8 years to 6 months doesn't make sense. That just circumvents the skin in the game requirement for ICP governance and puts the NNS/ICP at risk. Dominic gives a great suggestion with allowing two options: reduction to 5-year staking or keep your 8-year neuron the way it is.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-09 04:14:48 UTC | #390

Then there needs to be other things too, if your at for example 7 years and 3 months it should go to 4 years and 3 months or else you get a MASSIVE dump in exactly 5 years

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-09 04:15:25 UTC | #391

You assume everyone goes to 6 months and sells. That wouldn’t happen

-------------------------

Agnostic | 2024-05-09 04:16:14 UTC | #392

Dominic also mentioned that the changes could just apply to new stakers.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-09 04:16:32 UTC | #393

Everyone is paranoid that everyone locked up wants out early to sell. Come on this is gold we’re holding lol people aren’t trying to dump. And if they do let them I have plenty of fiat ready to keep accumulating.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-09 04:17:08 UTC | #394

They would make it easier. Just leave it all alone. And new stakerw 5 year max.

Honestly, I think the way to reduce inflation should be to increase the number of useful/in-demand dapps on ICP.  This would naturally lead to more people using ICP and increase "compute" which in turn leads to the burning of ICP (refer to the quote below).  That puts the onus on Dfinity and other developers which is where I believe it should be.  

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:10, topic:30352"]
Firstly about deflationary mechanics, that’s down to compute. The more compute that’s happening, the more ICP is being converted to cycles and burned. That’s why it’s exciting to see web3 services seeking ways to achieve hardcore mass adoption, such as Yral, and compute intensive applications, like AI, on the network. The more cycles being burned the better.

HOwever, I am willing to do some compromising since we can't get the above at the snap of a finger.  We can start with the new conditions for all new stake holders from here on.  Still reading through the posts to see if there's any other good ideas.  HOpefully, someone is keeping track of a good idea that a lot of people are agreeing to.

Where will all these new investors come from once the latter is pulled up by the early adopters? ICP is not the only crypto that pays staking rewards. How many of us would not have invested if the rewards were not as good? How many would have invested in a different project if rewards were only 10% and expected to drop from there? How many future investors will go elsewhere because they feel they weren't early to ICP and will search coinmarketcap for the next big project so that they can be early there. I'm as early so I'm set but I couldn't recommend that my friends invest and stake long term of the rewards aren't worth it (and are apparently subject to change at anytime). Don't be selfish and think about what this will do to divide the community and prevent it from growing. There are many other ways to lower inflation..

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-09 04:43:05 UTC | #397

ICP have gained 400% the last 6 months, with this rewards scheme while having early investors dumping millions of ICP each month.   These early investors dumping are almost done, tomorrow being the last day.  Then after, 200 to 300 thousand per month for another 12 months.

We have been through the 2.87$ ICP value.  Was certainly not easy, but did it.

Why the urgency now then?  Why just not be patient and wait a year or 2 to see what's going on?  

If the blockchain is that good as we all think it is, the demand will increase automatically and organically.

Up to last year, Dfinity was explaining and maintaining how good the tokenomics was.  I posted @bjoernek analysis and graph in previous post.

What have changed suddenly?  Are we trying to find a solution to a problem that does not exist?  This is very common in the crypto world.  I hope this community will not fall for this.

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 05:06:08 UTC | #399

Speak for yourself, but once I discovered and understood ICP I didn’t find any value on other projects, once you understand how different the architectures are, and what the biggest value proposition of ICP is, put money of everything crypto out there is risky, just BTC and Eth were my options to diversify a bit, computation and cybersecurity will be the biggest industries in the near future, ICP covers both, so there’s no other option in my opinion.


Rewards are nice as my net capital will be worth millions and will a 12-14% anual would be an excellent investment, saying you are here for the rewards make you look how you just didn’t understood icp yet, I recommend leaving to other projects where they can pay you more rewards, not by actual real revenue but by just inflation. Remember other projects are unsustainable as they doesn’t have any deflation mechanism, thinking transaction fees are a way to get revenue and will make them deflationary is ignorant.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 05:15:22 UTC | #400

You wanna know something?  I guess this kind of proposals are for people like you to make them leave early and not when prices are way higher, people like that should leave early and get rewarded less.

I guess you will drop your neuron to 5year if you have the option to do so if rewards are just a bug higher on 8year.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 05:45:58 UTC | #403

@adamracks completely with you. Up until now, I've been a huge advocate for ICP long term. 

The volume of people long term staking should in theory reduce any major crashes/manipulations of the price, I think ICP needs long term investors who are not dissolving to keep investor confidence and reduce major price swings. 
I would not have locked so much money into a project which seems will create price instability with the new proposal. 

I'd say the majority of investors would have 2nd thoughts if, when staking for 8 years an on screen pop up said - you cannot access your funds for at least 8 years, however your ROI may change at any time as voted on by the "community".
I personally had no idea this could happen and I've not read it anywhere.

I'd also like to know if dfinity staff are allowed to vote on this proposal. I'm assuming the ICP they received was part of their employment package, so they didn't "pay for it" as such if they're also being paid to work on this project. 

I'm struggling to take this as a serious investment if this is always a possibility moving forward. 

I'll keep my neuron as is, but I definitely won't be encouraging other people to invest their money in it anymore as my appetite for risk is different to others. 

What I don't understand, if this product is scalable as is, why they aren't marketing it to business as a way to fix inflation, rather than this approach.

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 06:17:05 UTC | #405

Yes, and big money, but you got that with time, crypto “investors” or better, gamblers are always in a hurry to make millions in few months, that not how it works, I kind of understand because when you are starting in the investment world you wanna make life changing money, but that takes time, trust me, I’m not in a hurry because I already went through it, now this is just another potential life changing investment but in the long run. ( as always)

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 06:19:47 UTC | #406

I don't know who you're preaching to?

If we are staked for 8 years, it's a pretty clear assumption we are in it for the long term...

-------------------------

adamracks | 2024-05-09 06:22:17 UTC | #407

Yeah I have my 8 year neurons locked non-dissolving. It is what it is. I want to see what Dom comes back with after letting the community discuss it for a week. Hope he just drops the idea. If not, I would not feel safe investing anymore into something where the reward structure that I based my calculations on was variable at any time for any reason. I understand that DAOs are flexible. But Dfinity team and the YouTubers they sponsored through community grants have been onboarding new stakers with these numbers and telling us that the tokenomics were good when compared to other blockchains. Now suddenly that isn't the case. Who is to say there won't be another proposal 3 months from now or 6 months from now.? How can we be sure there won't suddenly be a proposal to end staking all together? I wouldn't be sure at all if this proposal goes through. Definitely not sure enough to recommend this to a friend or family member..

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 06:25:51 UTC | #408

100% agree. 
I'm hoping this whole thing is dropped for a better idea too.

Overnight my confidence in ICP has gone from rock solid to "I'm not sure anymore". 

I hope this whole thing is scrapped.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 06:30:36 UTC | #409

Once again, why you keep complaining ? 

Another thing, you guys have to read between lines come on is not that hard, no one paid attention to the second proposal, and that’s in my perception targeting some big whales in the 🇺🇸, 🇬🇧, and other countries where tax is law and people worry a lot of that. 

If i’m not wrong i’ve been thinking that will make them think twice to sell their dissolving neurons, why? Not because it affects them but instead they can get taxable discounts if that second proposal goes through.

Now people have to pay 50% on the current rewards model, with the second proposal they will have to paid just 20% huge difference, that’s why Dominic’s proposals were 2, one or the other could benefit to avoid selling pressure, I think this proposals are more focus in selling pressure from liquid or close dissolving neurons rather than inflation itself. I guess now there are big VC’s thinking wheter or not sell their neurons or borrow maturity against initial investment, avoiding losing 30% in tax.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-09 06:33:21 UTC | #410

We're having a discussion. 
You don't have to participate if you keep saying I'm complaining. It's simple.

-------------------------

Doudi | 2024-05-09 06:47:35 UTC | #411

The truth is, Dominic did not explain **why** he wants to reduce inflation.

So lets summerize what does inflation : 

*+* is positive effect
*-* is negative effect

*+* promoting people actually using token
*+* making people having bags of token that arent stacked losing comparative value
*+* give good reward to believer that opt for the long run
*-* Because its scarcity per token decrease, the price per token wont rise as fast because of it ( BUT WHO CARES !? )

So lets summerize **what does a change in tokenomics towards reducing inflation** : 
*-* remove all positive impact on the above
*-* make people trust less a protocol that have a ever changing tokenomics
*+* will make the token more scarce so the price will rise a bit ( benefiting more people that are short term vision on the protocol )

Please feel free to complete this analysis for the stuff I might have i missed
And dont forget to remind your favorite #ICP gurus to make SWAT analysis before spreading 80 IQ proposals. I also cant believe I am here to do it.

I really dont get what would motivate such a move. Hey @dominicwilliams if you could give some more details it would be great.

-------------------------

adamracks | 2024-05-09 06:44:17 UTC | #412

We all see promise in the tech, that's why we're here. Most of us are here as investors, you too even tho you seem to think you're special somehow. What you are failing to realize is that the project is not complete. The project needs to grow. It needs to gain adoption and attract developers. In order for you to make that big money it also needs to grow the community and attract new investors who want to participate in governance by buying tokens (from you) and staking them which removes them from circulation, making tokens more scarce and driving the price (of your tokens) up. You think you're all good because you'll be grandfathered into what you thought was a good deal, but what about the new investors who won't join the community because the deal is no longer that good. The community needs to grow for this project to be the success you want it to be. Creating a small group of elite grandfathered gang members that get paid more to vote on the same proposals is not the way to grow the community or run a Dao. I'm against this proposal because of the inequality and division it will create in the community as much as I am against because it's cutting down rewards a little bit. It would be a shame to see the Dao turn into a governing council consisting of early adopters who tilted the table so much in their favor that no new player want to join the game..

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/possible-optimizations-of-nns-tokenomics-updated/30352/81?u=jdcv97

Have a look, second proposal you have to read it between lines, imagine you are a VC with few millions of tokens dissolving now, you are on huge profits, if you sell now you pay 20% capital gains, good,
But If you put on the neuron and this proposal goes you can borrow against that capital, with the maturity, paying 20% tax if you sell on open market, huge difference if this VCS have their neurons and mint ICP from maturity and then goes sell its 50%  income tax.

Basically every time this people sell rewards with current model have to pay 50% income tax, A LOT, ( I didn’t know that, as I leave in South America there’s no clear regulations about crypto here) 

Also they can go on a defi platform and get a loan from that ICP, no taxable event at all, same thing that billionaires does with stocks borrowing against the bank and putting their stocks as collateral

@adamracks 
Haha spot on mate!

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 07:17:04 UTC | #415

The decentralization narrative it’s over in my opinion, I care about a real product targeting a potential and clear problem in the near future that is cybersecurity, memes, defi, nfts, all those things I don’t see any value, defi already belongs to the giant ethereum, solana and most of the crypto project's trying to compete for the same use case it’s stupid to be honest..

So I don’t care and I don’t see adoption coming from retail, (yet) I see the first adopters will be institutions, governments and probably big enterprises, most of retail think their crypto communities means something, I didn’t see tesla crypto supporters, META, amazon, kids talking everyday on twitter or other platforms about how their stock is going up or down, Dfinity is focusing on where is the real value, Developers, where? Universities, schools, around the globe that’s where you go and start teaching all the programmers what is all this technology about, one time a cofounder of microsoft said DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERs!.

Smart investors will come, and not because they are watching or following anonymous profiles on twitter supporting a blockchain telling its the best, they have teams focused on researching the next big wave, the issue with this industry is still so young. Many people will be shaken out just like dot com era, where were created a lot of niche companies with zero value, when a product for not calling this a (software company) is well positioned for a evident problem in the future, and no one else it’s working on it, and your product it’s alone in the target future industry, you can be so confident it will win in the end.

-------------------------

adamracks | 2024-05-09 07:23:19 UTC | #416

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-09 07:31:10 UTC | #418

Yes got the point, and if you watch my first comments on this discussion I said that, but a precedent will be set, I’m not being affected, nor anyone else will be affected by this change, new investors will choose to lock or not their tokens at the new %.

They will see this and understand if any future prosal like this goes through their investment plans will be respected. Where is the issue you guys keep complaining? At this point am starting to think you both have other hidden interest here.

Yeah totally agree.
Long term stakers are taking the biggest risk, so they should see the biggest rewards. It seems they’ve used the 8 year stakers to set a stable base for the price, now want to flip it so more people short term stake to drive the price. I’m happy to be proven wrong.

The precedent will be set that if a group complains loud enough then inflation really isn't that important. If you think it is then why are you not advocating for rewards to be cut across the board, including 8year gang? If rewards are changed again in the future after this precedent is set, the new 5year stakers will complain and then they will be grandfathered in as 2nd tier OG VIPs and then only the new new stakers will be subject to the new lower rewards with two tiers of OG VIPs above them. It will be a shit show and attract nothing but critics

@8yrneuron 
Absolutely, it's sneaky AF. 
Same, I've been "flagged by the community" for voicing my opinion on this. 
Censorship at its finest. 

This topic doesn't belong on a developer forum, it should be made clear to the entire community. Not the dfinity/developer community to steer the outcome. Pure hypocrisy.

I also think any dfinity staff holding ICP (given as part of their employment contracts) who didn't purchase it after the public offering should not be included in this vote. 

They also hold a large amount in voting power with many people following their neurons. 
I believe there was a proposal go through for dfinity staff member to be made a publicly known neuron yesterday/today?

Why?
So the public can follow that neuron and steer the vote?

**Moderator's note:**

Geez... I woke up to see a flurry of flags. I will address some points.

1. @Mpeiz I just read the post from @Ajki suggesting you are a sock puppet account alongside @8yrneuron . 

2. I have decided to leave the comment because it is NOT quite ad hominem (I think you accusing me and others of having bad faith is much more ad hominem for example, and I have left those as is).

3. That being said... if the same comment of "X is a sock puppet" grows ad nauseam , I reserve the right to see it as targeted at a person, and may remove those. We do not want to bully folks out of a forum post

*However...*

@Ajki I do not think its quite fair to accuse folks of being sock puppets just because they joined at the time of this post. It is actually common for people to join for specific posts or threads. @Mpeiz saying they joined because of this post is valid rationale and we should take them at their word. If you repeat it again, I will take it as act of bullying someone out of the forum.

***When* someone joined should not be held against them, *whom* someone agrees with should not be held against them, only *what* they say should be held against them.**

I have only manually removed or accepted community flags from comments that are ad hominem. I nave notably left many comments where folks complain of cenorship. As annoying as they are, I have left them. 

I have even REJECTED the community flag to remove this comment by @Mpeiz because even though it is IMO snarky and unhelpful, it does not quite cross the line so i have brought it back: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/possible-optimizations-of-nns-tokenomics-updated/30352/427?u=diegop

**That being said... we have reached a threshold.**

1. Please comment on the actual *proposal* itself, ask questions, agree/disagree, etc...

2. Commenting on my admin style can be its own forum thread. Any more comments on it will be seen as "off topic" and I will remove. This is the warning. You can even make a forum thread titled "changes I propose to admin moderating". You can comment all there.

3. Commenting to complain about active admin behavior is ok once or twice, but if it becomes all someone discusses, my internal heuristic for "this person is acting in bad faith" will start to remove off-topic comments.

**Please heed this warning. Thank you.**

*(note: I have removed MANY comments you folks do not even see that are literally spam for buying/selling products. It takes quite a lot of to keep this forum spam free).*

MasonSJ | 2024-05-09 16:52:59 UTC | #442

Dom I am indifferent about both proposals. But I feel current staking mechanism may be stunting the ecosystem growth.

If people are staking their ICPs to NNS, then they won’t have any ICP left over to provide liquidity to the DeFi markets. I do not believe relying on external ecosystem users to bring in liquidity will work effectively, at least when we are ramping up our DeFi. If the end goal is to spark growth for ICP and drive up price, controlling inflation isn’t the only lever. Perhaps we can think about whether we are utilizing the staked ICP enough?

I feel there is a big opportunity cost with just parking the ICP on NNS when it can be used to give out loans and collect fees in DeFi for example and drive up TVL overnight. There must be a way we can utilize the staked ICP in ways that helps grow the ecosystem, safely and with the consent of stakers of course.

-------------------------

Agnostic | 2024-05-09 17:03:30 UTC | #443



Some have said that reducing the staking rewards could increase ICP price (by reducing inflation), and that would balance things out (decreased rewards but each ICP is worth more).  How about rewards not being decreased until we have *actual* ICP price increase?

In other words, add a condition to scale back on ICP rewards based on the price of ICP.  As ICP token price goes up, then scale back rewards by some percentage but still have a lower limit so that rewards won't go to zero even if ICP gets to $1,000 per token.

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-09 17:04:49 UTC | #444

So you want to use people's staked ICP for other ventures? If so, I'm out. I don't want this to be traditional finance where the bank loans out my money. What if the staked ICP is used on a failed venture? Wouldn't we then need to mint more to cover the losses? Maybe I misunderstood.

-------------------------

diegop | 2024-05-09 17:08:21 UTC | #445

I believe @MasonSJ 's comment can be summarized as:

1. There is an opportunity cost of locked up ICP in NNS (which could go to DeFi or other ecosystem activities).

2. they are then asking if there is some way to offset this opportunity cost, but was not saying staked ICP go towards Defi. More fishing for ideas/proposals to offset this opportunity cost.

But I could be wrong? please correct me @MasonSJ

-------------------------

MasonSJ | 2024-05-09 17:08:19 UTC | #446

I haven't thought out all the details but it is in that direction.

First 1) user should consent to it or explicitly opt in to do certain things, since we are changing status quo and 2) there are relatively safe activities like overcollateralizing the loans which should be pretty risk free. 

Why staker would agree to it, I haven't thought through. But you understand the direction I'm heading with this correct?

-------------------------

MasonSJ | 2024-05-09 17:11:03 UTC | #447

Yes correct. Lending was an example that I could think of. But there must be safe ways to utilize it via lending or other means.

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-05-09 17:20:47 UTC | #448

I think most people made a conscious effort / decision to stake their ICP specifically because they know themselves. For example, I know if I don't stake my ICP, I will invest in every little project that pops up because I find them interesting and then I'll have thousands of coins that aren't performing in line with ICP. I learnt last cycle that even if I have a plan to sell at certain levels, I get greedy. "Yeah, I'm up 5x on this coin but I KNOW it can go higher...oh buy the dip...it keeps dipping...bear market" I don't want to repeat the same thing by keeping my ICP liquid and would rather earn maturity that I could then sell with out concern for my principal investment.

-------------------------

MasonSJ | 2024-05-09 17:23:53 UTC | #449

Right, understood. Thats why its important to make it an optional opt-in for stakers, rather than forcing changes on them. Then no changes will come to people who don't want to do anything additional with their ICP.

-------------------------

Agnostic | 2024-05-09 17:30:08 UTC | #451

Your idea should be listed somewhere on a separate discussion as part of a top 5 list of alternatives or modifications to this proposal.

If people are staking their ICPs to NNS, then they won’t have any ICP left over to provide liquidity to the DeFi markets.

The fact that ICP can be fractional and if there is less ICP then it just makes it more scares and DeFi can just use fractions of the ICP token because it would be worth more. this statement of not enough ICP is bogus, in contrary its better makes it more valuable.

@ICPewPew I'm having a hard time reconciling whether inflation factor makes things even, as you said.

1) staked ICP are not burnt, they are actually generating rewards
2) are you saying, for example, staking 50% of ICP doubles its price? Because if I had 10 ICP I can use 10 for DeFi. But if I stake 5 ICP I can only use 5 for DeFi.
3) not much is in DeFi TVL at the moment

If we can generate fees by using some of the staked ICP and burning the fees, that might help us get closer to getting deflationary.
