Id say, do the change to max 5 year, but keep the 8 year gang who already had it from 1.mai or some date already passed. This way OG's get a well deserved bonus and not possible for people prevote to stake for 8 years. 

Or set a date ahead of time, where all can stake for 8 years before said date. Could be massive lockdowns, anyway, keep the 8 year OG's but 5 years max in the future is my vote. 

It will become sad if 8 year gang dissolves from its origin completely

Im an OG in ICP since 2021 and i locked my icp forever. I have plans to keep my ICP for my kids. Plz dont change how the rewards are for those who believed in ICP back then while everyone was calling it a scam. Change it to all new stakers who decide to stake now. Not for those who stood behind ICP since the beginning. Thanks

What a horrible idea to penalize those that truly believed in ICP enough that they locked up 10's of thousands or even hundreds of thousands for 8+years.  
You can word it how ever you like saying your giving us something back.  (lessening the amount of time staked to 5 years)  But this is not want we want or signed up for.

**Most of us that staked for 8+ years, don't have the intention of dissolving.**  
**We believe in ICP.**  

We are in it for the long haul.  If it goes to $0 or to $10,000 we are locked in.
Taking that away would be a punch in the gut to everyone that staked more than 5 years.  
Taking away rewards only for those that staked +5 years up to 8 years is only going to make those that  were fully committed to ICP have second thoughts.

Grandfathering in any neurons 5-8 years would solve this issue.  Any new neurons would max out at 5 years staked.  Also giving people a choice to unlock all or a portion their staked ICP if they don't agree with the direction of the changes.  We can't be the only ones getting possibly screwed with this proposal.

The ICP selling pressure may have nothing to do with the 8-year staking mechanism. 
From the following picture, it seems that the Big whales are dumping us -- that is the real reason.

I see this picture from twitter for the first time (https://twitter.com/CR_Thomas_W/status/1787720680970113186, https://icp.deliacapital.com/address-balances/balance-≥-1m/). 
Maybe you guys already knew it long ago, but it's pretty shocking to me, tbh. 
It will be really sad if we change the current "perfect" staking mechanism abruptly for nothing.

My best case scenerio

* Leave 8 year neurons alone (a choice to keep at 8 years or reduce to 5 years). Make it so we can't add anymore ICP to current 8 year neurons and make it so maturity is automatically dissolved or kept in stagnant non staked maturity until owner decides to dissolve, but not allowed to be staked towards voting power. That should help A LOT with inflation.

- If you change it so you eliminate 8 year neurons altogether then i think its fair to give the 8 year neurons a choice to accept the 5 year stake or completely unlock altogether as most will feel wrongly done by and they can move on. 

* Focus more on reaching people like Nayib Bukele prez of El Salvador, and Michael Saylor and get ICP (ckBTC) on the map with governments and corporations so adoption grows rampant and more cycles burn.

-------------------------

bluesteel | 2024-05-07 12:24:54 UTC | #241

These are the facts.

8 years pays 15.2% (from the dashboard).

Daily maturity is 67,653 (from the dashboard).

67,653 * 365 = 24,693,345 ICP a year in inflation.

Total supply = 518,305,065

Voting inflation is 0.4764249%

Sooo……

It doesn’t matter if we reduce 8 years to 5 years, what matters is the daily maturity payouts.

Any maturity payout greater than cycle burning will lead to inflation and any decrease/increase in price leads to an increase/decrease of node provider inflation.

Why not just reduce the maturity payout @dominicwilliams ?

As I put in my previous post,I’d pin maturity to cycle burn, but most wouldn’t accept that as it’s next to nothing currently.

Surely it’s just as simple as leaving everything as it is (in regards to neurons), and having a vote to reduce daily maturity by 20% to reduce inflation?

Another option.

Unlock everyone’s neurons, don’t pay any voting rewards (but let people vote) and let cycle burn make ICP deflationary?

Cryptobaasnl | 2024-05-07 12:29:02 UTC | #244

I believe this only accounts for known neurons.! there are still a lot unknown neurons that haven’t been indexed… (pre-genesis) meaning if the neuron ID is never been searched for on the dashboard they stay hidden…

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-07 12:53:46 UTC | #245

Why is everyone so quick to try to reduce voting rewards for the second time, when there are much better avenues to explore to reduce inflation / achieve deflation? We’ve reduced APY by 50% at the end of 2022, and then proceeded to go onto bleed to an ATL at the end of 2023 - clearly it’s much more dynamic then “take away more reward and price goes up”. Why do we think yet another 20% reduction solves it, and when do we stop taking away the incentivization to vote to secure the network?

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:3, topic:30352"]
can’t help but feel like there are better ways to “reduce inflation” than penalizing those who have staked for extended periods of time.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:22687"]
Lately I’ve been considering various factors that contribute to the sustainability of the supply of $ICP - one of which is staking, and in turn the yield correlated to it.

The current APY Scale can be found below;

6 Months - 8.9%

1 Year - 9.4%

2 Years - 10.5%

3 Years - 11.5%

4 Years - 12.6%

5 Years - 13.6%

6 Years - 14.7%

7 Years - 15.7%

8 Years - 16.7%

Information provided can be cross referenced at:

[Governance - ICP Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance)

This depicts that 6 Month Neurons are incentivized at 53% of the rate of 8 Year Neurons (8.9%/16.7%), while having the staking obligation of 6.25% of an 8 Year Neuron (6 months/96 months).

Additionally, a pattern that can be noticed within the staking reward scale, is that each additional year of staked time, results in about a 1% increase in rewards - however, the base layer of rewards, is 8.9% for only a 6 month timeframe.
[/quote]

For example, the APY scale clearly is not proportionate to begin with, so maybe that’s a better place to start than making such a drastic change that will affect the staking parameters of 56% of staked ICP.

I also have to question, how many voting rewards have to be taken away for inflation to be “acceptable”? This is not the first time we’ve gone in to change the reward scheme for the purpose of altering inflation.

Have you considered exploring the other face of the coin; the deflationary mechanics of the network?
[/quote]

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:23238"]
Referencing the ICP Burn Chart, it can be noted that the Internet Computer has a cumulative burn rate of 136822 ICP - of which, 136,215 ICP come from transaction burns (presumably burning conversion transactions), while 607 ICP comes from transaction fees.

Next, we can reference the Cycle Burn Chart for a more accurate gauge of the cumulative monthly burn of ICP over the last 3 months:

The cycle burn chart indicates that on average, 5.1B Cycles were burnt each second over the last 3 months, which equates to 440.64T Cycles burnt a day.

For simplicities sake, we’ll convert this to an ICP amount before extrapolating to a monthly basis.

This can be done by first dividing the daily cycle burn rate by the SDR exchange rate to determine the daily fiat expenditure of the network.

440.64T Cycles / 1T = 440.64 SDR (• 1.31 = 581.17 USD$)

This can then be extrapolated to an ICP amount by utilizing a 90 day average of the ICP token price, of 3.5$.

581.17 USD$ / 3.5$ = 166.0485 ICP

Now that we have determined the network burns 166 ICP / day across a 3 month average, we can extrapolate this to estimate a monthly network burn of roughly 4957.45 ICP.

In contrast, the previous article “Node Provider Inflation Spiral” depicted that the Internet Computer Protocol minted 500k+ (on the lower end) ICP each month, during this timeframe, reaching an all time high distribution of nearly ~600k ICP tokens last month.

Utilizing Augusts Node Provider Reward Distribution data, we can determine that of the 583,577 ICP minted to compensate Node Providers, only .84% of it was correspondingly burnt via Cycles, showcasing a disparity of 99.16% between Node Provider payouts & ICP burnt via cycles.

In PROTEST of this advised change to tokenomics, investors are voting NO on every single proposal ICP put forward INDEFINITELY unless given the option to be grandfathered in. 

This was not the agreement we made to stake our neurons for 8 years.

-------------------------

icme | 2024-05-07 13:41:19 UTC | #248

Before making any significant changes to tokenomics, would it possible for someone at the foundation to provide an analysis with some hard data + charts + well-reasoned projections that illustrate the initial problem with current tokenomics, and primary reason for making the change listed in proposal 1?

Ideally, the data could be provided in a separate post thread so it's easier for many to view?

I might first look at showing a few different scenarios. For example, if we kept the status quo with 8-year, vs. 7-year cap all the way down to 4-year to put everything in perspective.

It's buried now, but for those who have made it all the way through this thread, this post is from @Manu is getting a lot of likes and attention from the community.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/possible-optimizations-of-nns-tokenomics/30352/35

Taking into account the data modeling and forecasting requested above, it would be very interesting to see if the same inflation-reducing goal could be achieved without disrupting tokenomics at all.

-------------------------

8yearNeuron | 2024-05-07 14:06:07 UTC | #251

.1 How many tokenomics and governance proposals did DFINITY support, endorse, vote on till date?

2. How many of them were implemented?

3. How many of them were reversed. How many of the tokenomics proposal failed?


Why is DFINITY tweaking tokenomics again and again despite failing horribly multiple times and the large negative sentiment from general crypto cloud towards its actions like these.

All, make sure you've read the update I added to the main post – the proposal changed within an hour or two of it being made. Give me some time and I will create two new topics for the proposals, one which will be an updated version of Proposal 1 incorporating the discussions of yesterday. Thanks for participating in this discussion.

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:1, topic:30352"]
IMPORTANT/UPDATE: Forum discussions on May 6th updated Proposal 1 below. Some people are not reading through the replies thread! The proposal was modified so that 8 Year neurons would NOT be forcibly reduced into 5 Year neurons (and in fact, would have some adjustability too). In the modified proposal, it would only become impossible to set dissolve delays >5Y in the FUTURE, and delays on existing neurons would only be brought down if their owners wished (at their choice). Please make sure you read all replies and the state of play before assuming. As soon as I’ve got time, I will create proper forum proposals that split 1 & 2 below and which contain all updates and then fresh discussions can begin from there. This will take a week or so due to other commitments. What’s fantastic is that everybody cares so much and we can have these frank discussions about ideas as a community. Big thank you!

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-07 14:57:50 UTC | #256

Thanks @dominicwilliams let’s do this baby! Also can we maybe increase cycles burn rate? Like maybe 2x?

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-07 15:00:39 UTC | #257

Also @dominicwilliams the reduction if you go from 8 to 5 should align with where you’re at now. So if I’m at 7 years it should go to 4 years. If it’s 7 years 300 days, 4 years 300 days. The at way we all don’t have a massive dump on 5 years exactly.

Speaking on behalf of the [Personal DAO team](https://twitter.com/Personal_DAO): I have no issues with the updated version of Proposal #1 in which existing 8 year neurons are unaffected while limiting neurons hereafter to a maximum dissolve delay of 5 years.

I also have no issues with  Proposal #2

-------------------------

Slav.ICP | 2024-05-07 15:14:00 UTC | #259

Hello @Manu and @dominicwilliams and big Hi to all who committed for 8yeargang!


After reading the original proposal and many comments I came to the conclusion that the easiest way for us to find the best solution to any proposal is to firstly express what is out clear interest and expectations so that Dfinity team could come with the best solution. In the same time we need to be clear that all of us understand correctly how rewards function works, as i still have questions. I never participated in the forum before, but this is a very sensible topic so I created the profile and I hope you will read. Many of you know me from X, by the same name.

**[1] Who am I and what I expect from ICP protocol?**
I am an ICP investor since November 2021, started to buy ICP at 50$ and DCA-ed until the bottom. I am now an ICP whale with an average price of 5.5$ and I committed half of my ICP to an 8 year neuron. 

My neuron is in NON DISSOLVE STATE and I don't plan to hit that button in the next decade, instead I plan to add more ICP to the neuron and leave from maturity starting from 2026. Since 2026 i will disburse all my maturity and sell later. So regarding to the age of the neuron, for me it doesn't matter if it is 8y, 5y of 20y, but what matters is the annual yield and the annual (inflation minus deflation), as this affects the price. 

I expect to receive the highest annual return in maturity from my 8 year non dissolving neuron and also expect the protocol will have a low annual inflation by 2030 due to deflationary mechanisms.  

**[2] How rewards function works?** 
a)What I understand from the "Voting Rewards Function" which is currently at 6.96%, so I suppose the total annual maturity created can not be higher than this percentage. At this moment we have only 50% of total ICP staked in neurons, so I assume the inflation from non-staked ICP and non voting ICP goes to the ICP that are locked in neurons and do vote and this is how the 8 year neuron which has the most voting power can get up to 16% now. If we assume HYPOTHETICALLY that until 2029 there are 100% of ICP staked for 8 years and the voting rewards function is 5%, then every neuron gets 5% based on the equal voting power and assuming all participated to voting. **PLEASE CORRECT ME IF MY ABOVE ASSUMPTIONS ARE WRONG**

I don't understand in this case why so many 8 year neuron investors expect their neuron to give an annual yield of 16% after several years? I have made some calculations and if the rate of staked ICP rises to 75-85% by 2029 and assuming all of these ICP participate into voting, then the estimated rewards of an 8 year neuron won't be higher then 8-9%. This is absolutely logical. Think if 40% of total circulating ICP are staked for 8 years and have 16% APY, this means just they produce 6.4% of national inflation which is higher than the maximum of 5% expected for 2029, so it is not possible. 

b) If my above assumptions are not correct, then we could take exactly the opposite case into consideration and this would lead us to the HYPOTHETICAL case where 100% ICP is staked for 8 years, the "Voting Rewards Function" is 5%, so in 2029 an 8 year non disolving neuron will receive 5% * 2* 1.25 = 12.25% annual return in maturity and the national inflation will also be 12.5% if all maturity is minted into ICP. 

If case a) is correct then i don't see why we have to bother as 5% inflation will be counteracted by 2-3% deflation, but if case b is correct then we have a problem and we have to find a solution to @dominicwilliams 's proposition. @Manu please answer and let me know if A or B from [2] is the correct model. Thank you!

ic.aitubi | 2024-05-07 15:15:02 UTC | #260

**Proposal 1** makes good economic sense, even more with the latest update. It is not dissimilar to other funding schemes were the investee proposes bringing forward redemption, reflecting that economic circumstances have changed. Those ICP holders remaining long term committed can always redeploy their (ICP) capital by increasing participation in SNS/DAO projects, which we dearly need. This will increase IC utilization and ultimately cycles burned, further helping to achieve the supply-demand equilibrium that we are targeting.
**Proposal 2** needs more careful consideration, esp. the fiscal interpretation. Most tax jurisdictions define capital gains as limited to an *equal unit of underlying* increasing in price. In the proposal's example, as soon as the units of ICP increase, it is likely to be defined as financial income, not capital gain.

-------------------------

EpicICP | 2024-05-07 15:14:28 UTC | #261

As mentioned earlier, I think we need to solve this problem once and for all. So rather than tweaking staking parameters, we need to tie the total governance rewards to the amount of ICP that is actually burned on a regular basis.

That said, if this approach doesn't generate enough reward at the moment, then at least consider a limit that is some multiple of the actual revenue of the network. This multiple can be reduced over the next 4-years as natural revenue grow.

See my prior comment:

-------------------------

plsak | 2024-05-07 15:15:31 UTC | #262

Thank you @dominicwilliams, when discussing tokenomics update (shouldn't be applied often) I wanted to suggest one more modification (hope not too late - couldn't participate yesterday) which would **(slightly?) increase generation of maturity** but might **motivate people not to spawn a neuron (mint ICP - causing actual inflation) - include part of `Available Maturity` in calculation of `Voting Power`**

**Current VP calculation:**
```
voting_power = (staked_icp + staked_maturity) × age_bonus × dissolve_delay_bonus
```

**Suggested VP calculation update:**
```
voting_power = (staked_icp + staked_maturity + available_maturity/X) × age_bonus × dissolve_delay_bonus
```
- value of **`X` to be discussed and agreed**, e.g. 2 means counting in 50% of  available maturity, 5 then 20% ...


- **this would:**
  1. (further) motivate people to **keep maturity even as available rather than using it to mint new ICP** (causing inflation)
  2. (partially) provide a **short term staking functionality** which NNS currently doesn't provide
  3. in general this would motivate people to rather keep maturity than 'moving' it as ICP to some exchange

-------------------------

Amedli21 | 2024-05-07 15:17:23 UTC | #263

I have been in the lock for 8 years and I am happy with it. I do not criticize the proposed proposal. It is obvious that nns needs to be constantly updated in order to develop.
I could not understand the 2nd suggestion no matter what I did. Could you please share your ideas so that I can understand what the dom means in the 2nd suggestion.

Hi, I think this post should add a link to the neuron sandbox so people can visualize the impact the change will have on their rewards. 

I went through that and realized my rewards would be reduced from an average of .25 icp a day down to .21 icp a day. 

This brings me to the question if this proposed reduction will actually have the impact intended. 

As well as if Dfinity is starting to believe inflation is an issue would the team be open to leading the charge by burning a portion of their maturity rewards?

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-07 15:28:39 UTC | #266

If Dfinity proposed 1 and burned a portion of there a rewards to kick start this and make our total supply decrease the angels would cry from the heavens

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-05-07 15:29:46 UTC | #267

Would at least show they are taking the lead in the selfless act to reduce the inflation. Would increase community solidarity on this topic.

-------------------------

Scottsummersicp | 2024-05-07 15:33:53 UTC | #268

Absolutely I agree on this

Julian | 2024-05-07 15:49:06 UTC | #269

I'm quite new to the ICP project but I have started building up my 8 year neuron so I could retire earlier and enjoy this life. I also think ICP has a great technology and this project will win long term. As an investor I'm looking for certainty even though I understand this industry is quite new. This being said, as long as reward system can be altered anytime, any changes being made now can be amended at a later stage, providing an unsecured environment for investors. Binance provides an apy of 8% for 120 days, seems more feasible than continuing with nns. Quite dissapointing

@Manu please answer and let me know if A or B from [2] is the correct model. Thank you!
[/quote]

In option A, what you described is correct. The total reward pool for a given day is calculated as the total supply multiplied by the voting reward function, then divided by 365.25. This pool is then allocated to neurons proportionally to their voting power. Therefore, if only 50% of ICP is staked, neurons receive twice as many rewards as indicated by the voting reward function.

For a brief summary of the voting reward mechanism see [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/tokenomics/rewards/#recap-on-nns-voting-rewards). 
Additionally, if you are interested in simulating rewards for various neuron configurations, you can explore the NNS Neuron Sandbox  [here](https://klgza-cqaaa-aaaak-qcz5a-cai.icp0.io/).

Simple question : does Dfinity have any visibility of the behavior of the *restakers* from the two extrema (6 months – 8years).

My point is : if the main part of the stakers getting the biggest rates of rewards restake all their rewards, the inflation is not a problem since it does not bring any sell pressure.
[/quote]

Good question! Granular data on the flow of maturity on neuron level is not available as maturity is a private attribute of a neuron. 

However, we can get some insights from the dashboard (on the aggregated level): On this [page](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation), you can see that the majority of voting rewards is not yet spawned; the ratio between undisbursed vs disbursed rewards is approx 2:1 (82M vs 38M).  Furthermore, exposed [NNS metrics](https://rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai.raw.ic0.app/metrics) show the amount of staked maturity (which is approx 8M in the moment).

Sorry for the drive-by comments, but there is a lot above and lots going on, so I'll leave them and check back later:

Proposal 1:

- I'd rather focus on increasing demand than managing supply.
- How much ICP is minted for node providers in relation to the amount of maturity generated by voting?  I suspect that node providers are contributing significantly more to inflation, but I'm happy to be shown I'm wrong.
- I have a **black-hole code that sends ICP to an 8-year neuron**(each time I do this the official age drops a bit and then catches back up). If I can't top up my 8y neuron anymore, what i going to happen to this ICP?

Proposal 2:

- It seems like this directly counterbalances the ideas in 1. Liquidity turns into supply on a dime in the right environment.
- Can this be positioned as a loan somehow? You don't have to pay taxes on a loan generally.  You could 'borrow' up to X * (1-max spawn penalty) such that you'll always have at least enough in your neuron to cover your loan.
- Isn't this a kind of **CDP voting attack** that time-locked neurons were supposed to specifically target? I can borrow an infinite number of ICP at any rate under the reward rate, stake it, and accumulate votes at a higher rate than I have to pay interest in ICP.  Having to pay taxes on proceeds and the potential for a market downturn during spawn currently keeps this attack at bay.  If you remove those, you open the attack back up I think. (It may be hard to get the kind of loan that decays at the same rate of rewards, but I'd guess that someone would be willing to take on the risk.)

Thank you @bjoernek for the quick answer. 
Yep, I had the feeling this is the correct answer as I have studied the tokenomics some time ago from the same source. So this confirms my assumptions that in several years ICP will have a very low inflation if development on the protocol will continue and cycles will be burned. 

Long time ago I wanted to write a post on X that ICP tokenomics is genius because of of it's inflationary and deflationary mechanism and because of the direct utility of the ICP coin. A agree with folks who say NNS tokenomics should stay unchanged and provide security and stability for long term investors.

At the same time this topic probably is very important for investors and people who want to fud ICP as this will provide clarity upon the future inflation of ICP. 

**WHY ICP HAS GENIUS TOKENOMICS:**

Overall inflation is capped and is decreasing to 5%.
The deflation from consumed Cycles will hopefully burn 2-3% by 2030.
Still in 4-5 years will be newly spawned 8 year neurons that will accumulate maturity and the actual inflation will be lower than 5%, possibly only about 3%
This means in 5 years ICP could turn deflationary
Too high deflation on ICP is not good, as the protocol need to burn ICP in order to compute.
Developers that don't stake now ICP in order to run their projects from maturity will have to buy ICP at any price, but the cost of Cycles will always be the same, so their costs will be the same. 
If ICP will have low inflation and 75-85% of total Circ. Supply staked, then in 5-10 years the new developers will create a tremendous buying pressure on ICP.
If the protocol will keep developing and will be a top choice for developers then even in 10 years some developers will choose to buy and stake ICP in order to run their dapps.
**Imagine price of ICP going down a lot in 10 years while there is a lot of activity on the network and developers need to buy more ICP for Cycles (because of the low price) and suddenly there  are no more free ICP, at that point the price will skyrocket and developers will buy at any price.**

This is for my 8yearsgang fellows, stay strong, restake you maturity and acumulate voting power. One day the maturity received from voting will be very precious! 

Now  there is no pressure of selling from 8 year neurons, yes we will sell some of our maturity and this is not a drama, as is the case for other protocols that have liquid staking or stake only for a few weeks you can plan selling everything. 

@dominicwilliams ICP has a genius tokenomics, don't F.ck it up pls.!

Nobody has presented data or research that supports the efficacy of this change. Alternatively, data has been provided showcasing exactly where inflation is running rampant in the network. 

This is a transparent attempt to manipulate price action in the name of deflation by further removing the incentivize to vote to secure the network. 

I’ve noticed everyone is conveniently ignoring this question; 

How many times do voter rewards have to be reduced from the fixed & planned schedule to offset excessive inflation caused by other aspects of the network, and what is this going to do to the longterm security of the network?

I want to highlight:

1. There are many folks who agree and disagree in this thread and in the wider forum. They manage to do it in a way which is contructive and invites others to participate. 

2. ICP is a protocol. One is free to talk about it ANYWHERE. This is just one such place. It is a bit unfair to want to engage in this community because of its thoughtfulness and then hate the active management, please respect the work to get such thoughtfulness.

3. Despite the **clear snarkiness of your comment,** it is not being removed because it does not cross the line of ad hominem and other attacks. To me this as YET ANOTHER example of moderators who accept snakiness and criticism as a way to keep the standards of removal high.

[/quote]

This is not correct, voting rewards are way more significant, see https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation. Node provider rewards obviously depend on the ICP price, but in the last months it's been approx 250k ICP per month, so 3M ICP / year. The voting rewards are currently at 7% of supply, so approx 35M ICP (in maturity) distributed per year.

99% of this thread has been a thoroughly enjoyable, eye-opening and entertaining read. Thanks to all those who were able to advance their opinions whilst remaining civil.

A grand-fathering option for current 8 year gang appeals, not least because it would encompass my own somewhat measly neuron. 

But as others have stated, some in-depth modelling would be fantastic to assist those of us who want to ensure they back what is right for the network long term and try to balance their own targets.

I firmly believe a middle-ground can be determined. I firmly believe in ICP.

Kudos to mods on here too.

Man...if Ethereum is set in stone, where does that put Bitcoin? 😂

As recently as September 2022 Ethereum managed to pull off one of the largest carbon elimination events in history with the Merge, and has had two significant upgrades since via social consensus hard forks, so maybe it's not time to put it out to pasture just yet when we're having a hard time implementing voted for proposals that were ratified a couple of years ago. (And I'm the biggest ICP fan you're going to find around).

This brings up some interesting consensus topics as we try to decide these things.  We don't really have a fork option for better or worse, so we're all in the same locked rooms and have to find a way to all get out together one way or another.  Thanks to everyone who remembered to use deodorant.

Infinity-and-beyond | 2024-05-07 20:31:46 UTC | #293

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@dominicwilliams and All,
Here is another someone crazy proposal to reduce inflation :)
Have voluntary token burn mechanisms. Sounds crazy but with the right incentives people will burn their ICP :)

Step into the realm of voluntary token burn mechanisms, where the line between madness and brilliance blurs into a frenzy of excitement!  Imagine a world where every burnt ICP sparks a flame of change, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary with just the flicker of a virtual bonfire.

Step 1: Burn your ICP 
Embark on an adventure like no other as you journey to a website teeming with possibilities! Choose your destiny as you select from a myriad of options, from igniting a tiny spark with a fraction of ICP to unleashing the blaze with a golden inferno! Every burn fuels the flames of progress!

People go to a website or within NNS itself as see options such as:
Burn 0.0001 ICP -> NNS Wallet gets 1 white star and 1 stick 🔥
Burn 0.001 ICP   -> NNS Wallet gets 2 white star and 2 sticks 🔥🔥
Burn 0.01 ICP     -> NNS Wallet gets 3 white star and 3 sticks 🔥🔥🔥
Burn 0.1ICP        -> NNS Wallet gets 4 white star and 4 sticks 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Burn 1 ICP          -> NNS Wallet gets 1 GOLDEN STAR ! and 1 branch  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Burn Custom Amount  -> NNS Wallet gets n number of stars and sticks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Step 2: Huge Bonfire Celebration!
Witness the spectacle of a lifetime as we gather around the roaring bonfire at the dawn of each month! Feel the heat as participants from around the globe unite to toss their sticks and branches into the fiery abyss! With each click, the blaze grows fiercer, fueled by the collective passion of the community!

-Only wallets with sticks/branches can participate but anyone can go to the bonfire to celebrate!
-Whatever sticks are left over, get automatically burned OR they can save n number of sticks for a later bonfire.
-At the top of the website are a sorted list of wallet profiles that participated the burn this month for recognition! 
-At the bottom of the website is a chat for people to hang out (like an OpenChat hangout)

Step 3: Reward
Prepare to reap the rewards of your fiery devotion as 95% of the ICP in the burn wallets is consumed by the flames of change! But wait, what about the other 5%?! One lucky soul shall emerge from the ashes as the recipient of 5% of the ICP, chosen by fate itself!

The wallets with stars get more valuable as they are more rare. These stars are permanently etched to that wallet's identity and of course can get sold for a higher price of IDGeek. Behold the birth of a new era, where stars shine brighter than ever before! These celestial treasures, etched into the very fabric of your wallet's identity, become coveted symbols of prestige and power!

Of course there could be other incentive such as NFTs or a ticket to meet Dominic Williams haha.
The rewards and number of winner can very month to month.

-------------------------

vavram | 2024-05-07 20:35:58 UTC | #294

@dominicwilliams I think we should try alternatives that are less disruptive to current staking participants first like the periodic confirmation of following neurons mentioned above, then if required we can come back to this tokenomics change you propose.

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-07 22:02:37 UTC | #296

@dominicwilliams  if there’s no new top up from 8 year neurons, this included the autostake in that “top up” ?

If NOT is included, then the only option to make my ICP grow in that neuron will
Be with this autostake function? Or am able also, not to auto stake, but have maturity available and later on, opt to stake that maturity? Thanks

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2024-05-07 23:30:27 UTC | #297

ICP still needs more and more 8-year enthusiasts. Stopping newbies joining the 8-year gang may eventually make the 8-year gang a minority of the community someday, which can put the 8-year gang in danger since theoretically the majority can then directly deprive the 8-year neurons simply by voting. 

The ICP community can be stronger only if the 8-year gang can be stronger.

If a newbie buys 1000 ICP to join the 8-year gang, he may sell about 150 ICP rewards a year (for whatever reasons), but let's not forget that 1000 ICP is still greater than the total rewards of more than 6 years. If this newbie cannot join the 8-year gang, he may not buy 1000 ICP in the first place: reduction in ICP selling may also imply reduction in ICP buying. Is anyone able to do the exact math? I doubt it.

It can be strategically dangerous to discriminate against the newbies in such an obvious way.

daeitus | 2024-05-08 00:07:09 UTC | #299

some people have mentioned the importance of deflationary mechanisms; may i suggest my old proposal of allowing instant unlocking of neurons at the cost of being slashed? https://forum.dfinity.org/t/neuron-instant-dissolve-slashing/16250
"(originally posted in ICPMN telegram)

what do you all think of an nns mechanism that would allow a neuron to instantly dissolve, at the cost of being slashed?

something like a 10% slash for a 6 month neuron, up to a 50% slash for an 8 year neuron

would reduce total supply while allowing some flexibility"

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-08 00:47:17 UTC | #300

We're only going off the information we have to us at the time. I find it ironic posts in protest aren't allowed here. 

If this was the plan, it should have been in the original proposal.

To clarify, the 8 year non dissolving neurons won't be affected? 

Those who had planned to have a neuron remained locked indefinitely and use the voting rewards and ICP to either invest in more projects or sell, will remain like that?

Further, the received maturity will not diminish the principal of the original investment? 

So for example if a person has an 8 year neuron (not dissolving) and takes all their maturity rewards out as they come. In 8 years time that person still has a staked and non dissolving neuron with the same amount remaining in principle that they started with, correct?

![1000000403|690x431](upload://5xWwmtsSq7DoTveTWdrycchh6sc.jpeg)

This analysis and chart  by @bjoernek about 1 year ago is showing that burning will outpace the inflation and nodes rewards combined in only 4-5 years or so.  So, @dominicwilliams where is the inflation problem then? Don't we just need patience instead of a proposal that will, again, divide the community as it did before?
That analysis and chart made me confident that Dfinity had a plan and knew what they were doing.  This proposal is indicating the exact opposite.
So, was this analysis only a marketing stunt to board more investors in the 8 years gang?  Or it was and still is a serious effort to share the plan to the community.
If this is a serious analysis, then why bringing such a proposal on the table?
Why don't Dfinity just build confidence in investors by sharing that analysis over and over?
Because now, these kind of proposal only destroy more and more the investor's confidence.  Who would want to invest in such an unstable project?
I would certainly not recommend a friend to jump in and make financial plans with ICP. 
Why is @dominicwilliams now find 8 years being too long period, 3 years after launch while he was previously preaching the long term commitment so hard?
I agree we can lower the 8 years to 5, but keep the rewards the same.
According to your own charts, there will not have enough ICP available in 5 years and maybe we will have to do the exact opposite, mint more ICP and provide more rewards?  Who knows?

Please stop with 'Evolve", 'Flexibility'.  This is not how serious investors work.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-08 00:57:51 UTC | #302

Totally agree with you 

Not to mention it's the investors who are springing life back into this on the public radar as NOT being a scam as so many people still believe.

Investors who were also drawn to this project because of the tokenomics, the number of people staking their money for 8 years not dissolving etc.

To try and rug pull those people (who are locking away their money 8 years not dissolving, with no promise of a return on investment mind you), I know a lot of investors will lose absolute faith in this project - for another time...

Murphy | 2024-05-27 06:26:34 UTC | #304

To @dominicwilliams and everyone else who wants to change tokenomics.
I may have missed some details, but I read most of the discussion. I would like to introduce some principles of tokenomics that I believe in.

1. Compound interest is a scary thing. **Snowball of existing whales could increase the risk of 51% attacks.** Re-staking is a good idea, but selling newly minted coins is not a bad thing. Whether to invest in a new project or just to cover living expenses.
2. **Newbies should always be welcome.** We need to make it attractive for them to purchase ICP on the market and stake it. (Example: They may consider staking to maintain their own virtual servers and feed on their own AI models.) Our tokenomics, anyway, should support this welcoming.
3. **Tokenomics must be predictable.** Everyone can imagine minted Bitcoin in 2100; 21 millions BTC. This is why Bitcoin is respected. Because the community's resistance to change is so high, everyone can guess the future.

**The network must be stable, and also tokenomics must be stable.**

I know some have argued for deflation. However, I don't think deflation is a good thing; because of the first and the second. Ideally, the proportion of newbies' staking should be a meaningful amount. (Of course, it shouldn't be too big.) As long as there is no “death spiral”, inflation is not a big problem. The long term inflation rate, around 5 percent, is not too high. People will also burn tokens. If it’s predictable, whatever inflation or deflation, people can adapt and plan their actions.

Even though I agree with some parts of domic: 
[quote="dominicwilliams, post:10, topic:30352"]
Currently dissolve_delay_bonus starts at 1 for 6 months, and ends at 2 for 8 years, so 6 months gets 1, and 8 years gets 2, i.e. 8 years only gets double what 6 months gets. Personally I would agree that this should be radically adjusted.
[/quote]
I don't believe such problems are critical. Predictability is so important that economic models should not be changed unless there is a major problem.

-------------------------

Mpeiz | 2024-05-08 02:02:45 UTC | #305

Exactly, no one wants to invest into a project when the fundamentals as to why they made the investment in the first place can be changed at any time. 

Given the track record in the public eye, dfinity need long term investors, or they would have suffered a different kind of death spiral. 

Investors saved them from one death spiral, only for proposals to be made to change the fundamental reason they made the investment in the first place. 

I remember locking away initially for 8 years, I'm sure there was a warning of sorts that this was irreversible.. cannot be undone etc.

It's an absolute hypocrisy

-------------------------

Thank you for your answer @bjoernek. 

[quote="bjoernek, post:274, topic:30352"]
Granular data on the flow of maturity on neuron level is not available as maturity is a private attribute of a neuron.
[/quote]

We still have enough data available to perform a deep analysis since we can see : 
– exactly the change of icp stake of each neuron 
– exactly the change of maturity stake of each neuron (vpgeek.app tracks this data)
– and approximatively the amount of liquid maturity of each neuron

[quote="bjoernek, post:274, topic:30352"]
On this [page ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation), you can see that the majority of voting rewards is not yet spawned; the ratio between undisbursed vs disbursed rewards is approx 2:1 (82M vs 38M).
[/quote]

Exactly, so we could check how the 38M disbursed are distributed : who are these disbursers ? If the main part of them are short-term stakers, the proposal 1 (1.1 and 1.2) will not change their behavior but could change the one of long term stakers (converting them to a behavior of lesser staking/not staking more/unstaking)

If the 38M are due to long term stakers, the proposal could be good. 

We must do the same analysis to check the distribution of the maturity staking : are those 8M due to long term stakers or to short term stakers. 

Taking in account the difference between behavior or locked/unlocked neurons would be important too : 
– If a long term staker never disburse, but whose neuron is dissolving, that’s a bad thing for inflation eventually 
– whereas a locked short-term staker would comparatively be a lesser weight for inflation

So, more data are needed to be assured that this proposal 1 is a good call.

-------------------------

daeitus | 2024-05-08 04:45:40 UTC | #307

dfinity is abstaining from voting on this proposal. dom has agreed to a grandfather clause so that no current unwilling 8 year staker would be affected. you aren't even reading the thread before getting angry, which dom has pinned to the top of the page and which you still don't read lol

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2024-05-08 05:27:38 UTC | #308

Agree that this already passed proposal have to be implemented first, and see from there.
I am convinced that some dead people and lost accounts are receiving rewards every day.  I consider this as a nonsense.  Dead people are getting paid for voting. Think about this for a moment.

It was voted and passed. Should be implemented, rather sooner than later.
But if Dfinity or/and Dominic decide not to implement it, as they seems to have decided, there is nothing we can do.

(Wondering how IRS will manage to tax the rewards of a dead person 😂)

-------------------------

Julian | 2024-05-08 05:47:36 UTC | #309

Maybe worth looking into keeping the same rewards for those neurons that are active and manually vote every single day and adjust rewards for the ones who vote mostly based on the neurons they follow?

-------------------------

Schnitzel | 2024-05-08 05:58:55 UTC | #310

If I were to do it, I would limit maturity to some max cap amount tethered to fiat (or gold even just in case of hyperinflation), and after that limit (that will come when ICP price go up) we can tether it 1:1 with ICP being burned for prices above the limit.

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2024-05-08 06:08:05 UTC | #311

-------------------------

8yearNeuron | 2024-05-08 06:19:11 UTC | #313

If I'm not wrong, maturity cannot be used to mint Bitcoin or Ethereum tokens, right?

We need sound economic analysis and simulations by some real trained economists than some out of blue thoughts by self righteous opinionated engineers who think they are almighty.

Also the real problem is how to make ICP deflationary by burning more. 8 years or 5 years do not matter much. Think of a mechanism to burn more.

2. I did write that the *independent* phrases "screw over" and "dfinity sounds like a drug addict” in **both comments**, are not the tone we want for the forum. If the flagegd comment had said "Alice sounds like a drug addict", maybe the bad  nature of the comment is more obvious. These are phrases from the **two comments flagged**.

3. If you find my writing of the message confusing because I messaged two users at the same time about two comments, I think that is fair. I will not group two users in the same comment again.

if you read my comment quickly and realize your mistake, that is ok. I cannot cast stones myself for I have certainly misread many things and gotten upset before reading closer.

This one was done by Dfinity last year and is showing that it will be deflationary in about 5 years from now.

This is not open discussion, Forums is owned by DFINITY. Twitter is not Owned by DFINITY. I guess I can see why they don’t want to publish this discussion on Twitter. They’re afraid of honest criticism and cannot censor twitter posts.

Are discussions on other platforms forbidden? Make a post on X, let the discussion happen, go through all the comments, and filter out the 'fucks,' 'retards,' 'drug addicts,' and other ad hominem attacks. Draw conclusions and create a proper post with sound arguments here, and no one will delete it.

@diegop I do not want to waste both of our time arguing here. So i'm going to agree with you. Lets agree to disagree.

Anyone can share the forum with anyone. In fact, that’s very common.

It’s also common in this forum (more people to post ideas to get feedback and iterate, then increase how loudly they share as things become progressively baked.

If it were a real NNS proposal. The ones people vote on, those are typically more baked and more loudly shared

why didn’t Dominic make the AI announcement here instead?
[/quote]

Because the AI post was an actual demonstration, **possible** tokenomic changes are gathering feedback before an actual proposal is crafted.

Even the name of the topic starts with 'POSSIBLE,' with the whole purpose of gathering community feedback. Can we return to the actual topic and not derail it with off-topic comments?

This is your opinion and I am not obliged to share the same or agree with it. Beside I was addressing @dominicwilliams about the share. You are not Dominic. Unless you speak for him thats a different topic.



Why didn't you share this topic on Twitter @dominicwilliams Don't you want your investors to know about the major changes being discussed?

It's evident that the 8-year gang are a group of very faithful believers. I don't understand why the ecosystem and Dfinity aren't engaging in more marketing and airdrops centered around the 8-year holders, creating more valuable NFTs or memes, and rewarding core users. If you don't make loyal users rich, how can you attract users from other blockchain projects? Dfinity and all SNS projects have disappointed the enthusiasm of the 8-year holders.

High inflation but almost no ecosystem burning is one of the fatal problems of the ICP token economic model.
The rules of @dominicwilliams are too complicated and seem unfair to the 8-year-gang.
Let's simplify a complex problem.

Reduce all parameters by 50%.
That is, stake term, maturity, etc. 

The minimum stake term should also be reduced from 6 months to 3 months.

The final inflation rate also shrank from 5% to 2.5%.

-------------------------

cryptodriver | 2024-05-08 08:51:55 UTC | #337

One more word:

Market value management is particularly important.
The same as stock market.

-------------------------

viva | 2024-05-08 09:50:57 UTC | #339

Suggestions on controlling inflation: Is it possible to anchor the amount of rewards to be burned, the total number of rewards is equal to the amount burned, the more prosperous the ecosystem, the more the number of burns, the more the total number of rewards. Then, according to the number of nodes, staking weight, etc., the total number of rewards will be paid first, and the remaining will be dynamically paid according to the number of years, quantity, etc.

-------------------------

ildefons | 2024-05-08 13:03:02 UTC | #340

@viva if only this change occurs (burning = rewards), those with long dissolve delays would not be able to take advantage of the sudden price pump. So,your ideas should come with unlocking everyone at the same time which would create a price dump we may not be able to recover

I'm genuinely thrilled and amazed by the power of decentralization within the ICP community, particularly through the insights provided by SNN holders. Witnessing how individuals collectively shape the ecosystem is truly inspiring. Here, the community determines what's best, showcasing the remarkable potential of decentralized decision-making. It's truly amazing

I started my 8 year, non-dissolving, neuron in August 2021 and added to it bigtime since. I obviously did it because, I believe in the project but, also for the staking rewards. Maybe we should consider giving a choice to those who already have an 8 year nueron if they want to reduce or not and, if not, keeping those rewards as they have been and,  going forward only offer max 5 years.

Hello.
I have read the various opinions.
Basically, I am in favor if all stakers are fairly shortened in term and reduced in compensation.

However, I think this is a last resort and an admission that Dfinity has failed to design token economics.
We must also be prepared to be accused by other communities of being centralized and having failed to design it.
There is no excuse.

Has Dfinity considered permanently locking some of the tokens held by the foundation and not receiving compensation for them?
First of all, they are responsible for their own creation and design.
Do you not perform self-sacrifice?

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-08 14:44:59 UTC | #344

I feel as though this is extremely important to the topic, yet isn’t being considered - this analysis is what ICPs tokenomics are modeled after.
