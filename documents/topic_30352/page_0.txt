**UPDATE: May 27, 2024**

**Moderator’s note by @diegop** 

**TLDR**: I am locking this thread, but not because of any bad behavior, but because I have gotten a lot of feedback that its too large to properly digest properly. Too many ideas and comments. New ideas can come from new threads.

In fact, one main comment which many people missed was this one:

[quote="bjoernek, post:517, topic:30352"]
Hi all,

I have provided further analysis on the proposals in this thread in a separate [post ](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/analysis-of-proposals-on-neuron-dissolve-delays-and-exchange-maturity/30890).

In a nutshell, we suggest to not pursue the two proposals further, given the concerns raised and the relatively low impact.
[/quote]

In this comment, @bjoernek is writing on behalf of DFINITY explaining why DFINITY got the feedback Dom was looking for, and **DFINITY decided to not pursue the proposal further.**

There is even a new thread about it here: [Analysis of Proposals on Neuron Dissolve Delays and Exchange Maturity](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/analysis-of-proposals-on-neuron-dissolve-delays-and-exchange-maturity/30890)

Anything beyond the line below is by the original author: Dom.

############################################################################

Hello everyone. I want to propose two changes we could make to NNS governance with the aim of optimizing network tokenomics.

These two changes are not slam dunks, but they could provide some significant advantages, and our purpose should be to continue improving tokenomics, in the same way that we constantly make the network faster, more efficient and more capable as we move into the future.

The ideas are standalone, so we could take both, one, or neither!

**IMPORTANT/UPDATE: Forum discussions on May 6th updated Proposal 1 below. Some people are not reading through the replies thread! The proposal was modified so that 8 Year neurons would NOT be forcibly reduced into 5 Year neurons (and in fact, would have some adjustability too). In the modified proposal, it would only become impossible to set dissolve delays >5Y in the FUTURE, and delays on existing neurons would only be brought down if their owners wished (at their choice). Please make sure you read all replies and the state of play before assuming. As soon as I've got time, I will create proper forum proposals that split 1 & 2 below and which contain all updates and then fresh discussions can begin from there. This will take a week or so due to other commitments. What's fantastic is that everybody cares so much and we can have these frank discussions about ideas as a community. Big thank you!**

**PROPOSAL 1: Reducing neuron dissolve delays to reduce inflation**

General context: ICP has fought its way through significant sell pressure pretty well. Future step downs in sell pressure are also coming. Our belief is that major VCs who bought in early will be exhausted this year, which will put the network in an enviable position – the other major networks remain mostly held by such parties behind the scenes, often in the range of 75-85% (yes, you read those insane numbers correctly!). ICP holders are already vastly more decentralized, and the more so it becomes, the better.

Nonetheless, finding ways to allow the network to breathe still make a lot of sense, and one of the ways we can address that is by reducing inflation. Today, the primary source of protocol inflation is governance staking. The question is, can this be reduced by updating the protocol, without breaking promises the network has made to those who have staked. The answer is, yes, potentially:

Outline of proposal:

1) Reduce the dissolve delays of all neurons by 5/8th (to 62.5% of what they is today)

2) The age property of neurons would stay the same (age increases over time, benefiting voting power, and is set to zero whenever a neuron is placed into dissolve mode).

3) The minimum dissolve delay at which a neuron can gain maturity by voting, would be reduced to a round 3 months.

4) The overall notional voting reward distributed by the network, which is logically distributed by votes to determine how maturity increases, would be reduced, such that the rate at which a neuron’s maturity grows, given some amount of locked ICP, dissolve delay and age, would remain almost identical to that today.

The main benefit to tokenomics is that this would reduce the amount of new maturity that neurons gain by just under 20%, which is definitely significant (the immediate ICP impact would be less, since many do not use their neuron maturity to create new ICP, but especially over the long-term, this would definitely have an effect).

This would mean that if you have 8 year neurons today, and this change were made, then you would find you now had 5 year neurons, and the maturity would grow at the same rate as for 5 year neurons today (given the stake and age).

Those with 6 month neurons (currently the threshold for gaining maturity by voting), would then have 3.75 year neurons, but they would still gain maturity, since the minimum threshold for gaining maturity would be reduced to 3 months – which will also be useful for those wishing to try out governance staking for the first time.

5 years is still a very considerable time to make a commitment, but it’s not as mind-bending as 8 years, which makes the system more friendly.

But what about the hardcore “8 Year Gang”!! Would this have to become the “5 Year Gang” since they have now have 5 year neurons!!!?

My suggestion is that if you identity as “8 Year Gang” (and all mine are 8 years) then you would continue to identify as before and the moniker says the same.

For example, Porsche is going electric, but the fastest Taycan is still the “Taycan Turbo S” even though electric cars don’t need turbos. The “8 Year Gang” can continue in the same way. It's really about commitment to the future.

**PROPOSAL 2: Swapping locked ICP for unstaked maturity.**

You should always get your own tax advice, but, by design maturity is an attribute of a neuron, not a cryptocurrency that lives on a ledger like ICP that can be transferred and sold. Furthermore, the amount of newly minted ICP that a neuron can produce by applying its maturity is indeterminate, and subject to modulation by external factors like price trends, and even updates to the NNS, further indicating that maturity is part of the value of a neuron and has indeterminate value.

This design means that when a neuron gains maturity, this is not realized income (again get your own advice). However, it is hard to argue that when the owner of a neuron uses its maturity to produce new ICP by spawning, then this represents the generation of income, since the newly generated ICP can be transferred and sold, and has a more-or-less determinate value, and in most jurisdictions (unless you live in Monaco, UAE, Puerto Rico, etc) income tax will be due on the new cryptocurrency you have produced.

The maturity of voting neurons increases near continuously, and its nature arguably provides administrative advantages compared to traditional staking, which regularly pays out cryptocurrency, forcing constant accounting. Nonetheless, there are some disadvantages.

Perhaps the largest one is that maturity is an attribute of a neuron, and not a cryptocurrency! This means that it can’t be used in things like DeFi. There is a lot of maturity sitting on neurons that might usefully be deployed if it were unlocked ICP! We might try to fix this.

Outline of proposal: When a neuron has unstaked maturity, then the owner can swap that unstaked maturity for ICP that is locked inside i.e. such that the unstaked maturity becomes locked inside, and the ICP is freed (currently maturity can already be staked, so this is not a big leap).

Example benefits:

1) Unlocking your pre-existing ICP is tax neutral, so the owner could, for example, transfer the newly unlocked pre-existing ICP into a DeFi service and borrow against it. This might unlock more liquidity for DeFi.

2) If a neuron owner needs to realize x fiat gains for a financial purpose, they could sell their newly unlocked pre-existing ICP, paying capital gains, rather than applying maturity to generate new ICP for sale, which is subject to income tax. Since in e.g. in places like the UK, capital gains is 20%, while income tax 50%, this would make it possible to sell less ICP to realize the required fiat gains. This might result in less forced sales.

3) If a neuron owner wishes to have unlocked ICP to swap for some other token, and would otherwise have to apply unlocked neuron maturity to produce new ICP, then benefits as per advantage (2) above.

These two proposals are quite nuanced, and interested to hear thoughts.

In proposal 1 are you saying that for people who have staked for 8 years would endure a 20% hit on the voting rewards they are getting currently?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-06 15:47:53 UTC | #3

I can’t help but feel like there are better ways to “reduce inflation” than penalizing those who have staked for extended periods of time. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:22687"]
Lately I’ve been considering various factors that contribute to the sustainability of the supply of $ICP - one of which is staking, and in turn the yield correlated to it.

The current APY Scale can be found below;

6 Months - 8.9%

1 Year - 9.4%

2 Years - 10.5%

3 Years - 11.5%

4 Years - 12.6%

5 Years - 13.6%

6 Years - 14.7%

7 Years - 15.7%

8 Years - 16.7%

Information provided can be cross referenced at:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance

This depicts that 6 Month Neurons are incentivized at 53% of the rate of 8 Year Neurons (8.9%/16.7%), while having the staking obligation of 6.25% of an 8 Year Neuron (6 months/96 months).

Additionally, a pattern that can be noticed within the staking reward scale, is that each additional year of staked time, results in about a 1% increase in rewards - however, the base layer of rewards, is 8.9% for only a 6 month timeframe.
[/quote]

For example, the APY scale clearly is not proportionate to begin with, so maybe that’s a better place to start than making such a drastic change that will affect the staking parameters of 56% of staked ICP.

I also have to question, how many voting rewards have to be taken away for inflation to be “acceptable”? This is not the first time we’ve gone in to change the reward scheme for the purpose of altering inflation. 

Have you considered exploring the other face of the coin; the deflationary mechanics of the network?

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 15:56:09 UTC | #6

People who have staked for 8 years, would see their maturity grow more slowly/get fewer rewards. However, if this scheme were adopted, they would only be locked for 5 years, and they'd been getting the same rewards that people locked for 5 years get today. In one sense this is a bonus for them: they rode the wave as 8 year neurons, getting those higher rewards, and now they are only locked for 5 years.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-05-06 15:57:57 UTC | #7

Would the current 8 year stakers get any sort of bonus to offset this reduction in rewards?
Such as the "genesis neuron" bonus? 

Or will this be just a straight reduction across the board?

[/quote]

Please don’t take this as me voiding my previous comments, but why is this relevant to the lowering of APYs? If you believe they’re contributing to sell pressure, wouldn’t it be more logical to lower APYs while they have stakes active, rather than after they’ve exited?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-05-06 16:06:34 UTC | #9

I’m also curious if you think the continuous intentional “avoidance” of taxable events will lead to longterm legal problems.  

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:20936"]
**The Evasion of Taxable Events**

While it may not have been intended, this mechanism directly evades taxable events.

This is due to the fact that the Neuron Fund can only draw from liquid Maturity, that could be spawned, but instead is utilized under the guise of “Maturity” - which is conveniently not tracked within either Blockchain Explorer (ICScan or IC Dashboard), or the NNS itself.

The lack of transparency presents two issues - being the inability gauge how much maturity was used in the sale, and how much is received from off-loading the position. Which in turn leaves all maturity to fall under the umbrella of a singular taxable event, being the spawning of staking rewards.

Utilizing the USA as the example jurisdiction (however, many jurisdictions apply similar laws), given the abundance of open court cases against DFINITY within the region, the following taxable events are directly evaded;

1. Spawning of ICP Rewards
2. Conversion of $ICP to Token
3. Spawning of rewards from SNS Tokens
4. Conversion from Token to ICP

I’d also be willing to make the arguement that Maturity Modulation only exists to avoid Switzerlands “Wealth Tax”, but that is another topic.

Firstly about deflationary mechanics, that's down to compute. The more compute that's happening, the more ICP is being converted to cycles and burned. That's why it's exciting to see web3 services seeking ways to achieve hardcore mass adoption, such as Yral, and compute intensive applications, like AI, on the network. The more cycles being burned the better.

Secondly, about the fairness of voting rewards, the voting power of a neuron is neuron_stake * dissolve_delay_bonus * age_bonus, and your "share" maturity gains are proportional to your voting power/votes performed (as per https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/staking-voting-rewards).

Currently dissolve_delay_bonus starts at 1 for 6 months, and ends at 2 for 8 years, so 6 months gets 1, and 8 years gets 2, i.e. 8 years only gets double what 6 months gets. Personally I would agree that this should be radically adjusted. 

What I would prefer: if we updated so 3 months minimum, and 5 years max, then probably 5 years should be receiving 2.5X+ what 3 months gets.

The challenge is how to change that. Somebody who is currently locked at 1 year would see their rewards change downwards, and might scream the change is unfair since the dashboard told them 1 year gives you something else – albeit the guarantees provided by the NNS are weaker than "you have an ICP on the ledger," which is of the immutable cryptocurrency kind. 

Here's what I would suggest might be done: adjust the way the dissolve_delay_bonus works for new staking, but not for neurons that are already staked. So if there's a 2 year neuron, it continues to have the same voting power before (unless it was Seed/ECT and is in the process of dissolving, since this cohort didn't stake on the basis they would get some specific voting power, and no promise is being broken).

New staking would work according to the new scheme however.

I am aware, but like staking, there are parameters that can be adjusted to offset inflation, if it is a concern. This in turn makes the Internet Computer more expensive to use, but this isn’t unprecedented; inefficiencies have been defined & corrected in the past. 

For example, you can refer to Node Provider payouts in relation to Cycles burnt, and it’s easy to determine where inflation runs rampant. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:23238"]
**TLDR:**

**- Nodes on the Internet Computer operate at a 100x+ inefficiency, with self imposed limitations of 300GB while having the capacity to store 30+ TB**

**-The Internet Computer burns .84% of what is rewarded to Node Providers on a monthly basis via Cycles Burnt**

**-Of the 36 Subnets, with a total storage capacity of 10.8 TiB, only 3.55 TiB is utilized, representing an inefficiency of 70%+**

On September 11th 2023, I published the article “Node Provider Inflation Spiral” within $ICP forums, of which, can be referenced below:

[quote]
Node Provider Inflation Spiral Please note that aside from raw data, this article is purely speculative with the intention of provoking thought & conversation. This article covers hypothetical scenarios at predetermined price points extrapolating from current metrics to observe potential futures. This article is not financial advice, nor should the scenarios within be considered as fact. This stems from a conversation with a fellow ecosystem member regarding how Node Providers are rewarded for…
[/quote]

This conversation sparked great interest, earning acknowledgment from members of the DFINITY Foundation as a valid concern that should be addressed. Subsequently, this sparked the interest of multiple Node Providers, most notably, @DavidM & @dfisher ,
who voiced multiple valid points & concerns, from not only the perspective of a Node Provider, but from the perspective of an individual attempting to safeguard the Internet Computer Network.

With this being said, a perspective recurringly raised by vocal node providers, is the importance of not correlating a subnet & its nodes’ reward rate, to total subnet useage.

This concern was raised due to the fact that Node Providers can not pick the subnet they’re in, and therefor are consequenced with the potential of contributing to an underused subnet - earning lesser rewards in contrast to the previous system.

**This again, sparked my interest:**

**if Node Providers can not contribute to the network at scale without fear of contributing to an unused subnet, is the network over burdened with Nodes, or are Cycles not being burnt proportional to the true cost of running the network?**

The first question to address is whether unused subnets should be compensated - taking us down a difficult road to navigate.

On one hand, if a Subnet is not being used, it is not contributing to the cycle burnt rate, and therefor only has the potential to increase inflation under the current reward scheme.

On the other hand, we have to consider why this inflation trade off is made. The Internet Computer is completely reliant on Subnets of Nodes to scale - if left without room to grow, there will come a time in which the network has to scramble to provide Nodes in time for dApps, which can take months, given Nodes are hosted in Data Centers.

As such, the line of determination in regards to what Nodes should and should not be compensated is cloudier than presumed.

However, something that the Internet Computer Network as a whole has agreed on, is that Node Providers providing degraded, or lesser services, are deserving of reward slashings. I believe a similar system could be translated to unused Nodes & Subnets, although that’s not what we’re here to discuss.

From here, we can begin to determine the disparity in total Node Provider Reward Distributions & Cycles Burnt, in contrast to the network state overtime.

Referencing the ICP Burn Chart, it can be noted that the Internet Computer has a cumulative burn rate of 136822 ICP - of which, 136,215 ICP come from transaction burns (presumably burning conversion transactions), while 607 ICP comes from transaction fees.

Next, we can reference the Cycle Burn Chart for a more accurate gauge of the cumulative monthly burn of ICP over the last 3 months:

The cycle burn chart indicates that on average, 5.1B Cycles were burnt each second over the last 3 months, which equates to 440.64T Cycles burnt a day.

For simplicities sake, we’ll convert this to an ICP amount before extrapolating to a monthly basis.

This can be done by first dividing the daily cycle burn rate by the SDR exchange rate to determine the daily fiat expenditure of the network.

440.64T Cycles / 1T = 440.64 SDR (• 1.31 = 581.17 USD$)

This can then be extrapolated to an ICP amount by utilizing a 90 day average of the ICP token price, of 3.5$.

581.17 USD$ / 3.5$ = 166.0485 ICP

Now that we have determined the network burns 166 ICP / day across a 3 month average, we can extrapolate this to estimate a monthly network burn of roughly 4957.45 ICP.

In contrast, the previous article “Node Provider Inflation Spiral” depicted that the Internet Computer Protocol minted 500k+ (on the lower end) ICP each month, during this timeframe, reaching an all time high distribution of nearly ~600k ICP tokens last month.

Utilizing Augusts Node Provider Reward Distribution data, we can determine that of the 583,577 ICP minted to compensate Node Providers, only .84% of it was correspondingly burnt via Cycles, showcasing a disparity of 99.16% between Node Provider payouts & ICP burnt via cycles.

Turning our attention back to Network State, it can be observed within the following article that Gen1 Node Machines have a storage capacity of 28.8 TB & 30.72 TB

https://www.coinhustle.com/how-to-become-node-operators/amp/

Alternatively, Gen2 Node Machines have a storage capacity of 32 TB.

DRAFT PROPOSAL Below is an example of a proposal we (the DFINITY R&D team) intend to submit to the NNS in a few days/weeks, depending on community feedback as well as questions and answers. We want to hear what you all think, including any wording changes we need to make Summary TLDR: As part of the work to further decentralize the infrastructure layer, we want to submit a new motion proposal to introduce a new type of hardware spec (and its corresponding remuneration) for nodes on the IC. W…
[/quote]

In contrast to their abundant storage potential, according to public documentation & official forums, subnets are seemingly limited to a capacity of 300GB.

With this information laid out, we can continue to the Network State:

As of present, the current Network State is 3.55 TiB of a total 10.8 TiB, across 36 subnets - which equates to roughly .098 TiB per Subnet (the math is not so simple, but this is useful to depict network load), or roughly 30% of each Subnets maximum capacity in correspondence to current self imposed limitations.

This goes to show that the issue is not so simple as “are we over paying or over onboarding Node Providers?” - it’s a combination of both, with Cycles burning less than 1% of what Node Providers are compensated monthly, while Nodes are operating at seemingly a 70% inefficiency.

I completely agree, and that goes both ways here - when we talk about reducing stake parameters by 3 years & an APY reduction of -20%, we run into the issues of the dashboard promising x, while the NNS is consistently making changes to effect this. 

I feel like the solution is much more nuanced than simply reducing stake timeframe & APY in an effort to curb inflation.

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 16:38:50 UTC | #13

"Legacy" VCs who got into the ecosystem years ago don't stake ICP. They cycle assets to pay out to LPs of their earlier funds. So I don't think maturity calculations will make any difference to their behaviors (if that's what you meant). Most of them are underwater in their 2021-2 investments (think of the huge sales that NEAR Protocol made, for example), and cycling profitable 2018 token holdings to demonstrate to their LPs they are capable of making returns, so they can raise new funds, makes sense for them. That's just the way it is.

I mentioned them only because 1) it's important to realize that there have been significant sources of sell pressure outside of inflation, so no point getting overly obsessed by inflation when thinking about tokenomics, but 2) anyway, it is also true that ICP has had to fight through sell pressure, and as it dries up, why not press home the advantage by making tweaks to tighten up tokenomics.

jamesbeadle | 2024-05-06 16:43:11 UTC | #14

Literally based an entire business on staking my SNS DAO's ICP treasury, so no, please don't give me a 20% pay cut.

System1 | 2024-05-06 16:44:17 UTC | #15

Please, people have made long term plans with the staking rewards and I’m one of them. Whatever you do, don’t alter the tokenomics and reward. We knew the risks and we went for 8year non desolving , please don’t alter it if it will change the rewards. Thanks

Mico | 2024-05-06 16:47:42 UTC | #16

I would vote to approve this proposal if it only altered new staking neurons and gave the current 8yr neurons a vp bonus similar to genesis neurons that will allow them to retain the current vp schedule

-------------------------

Roman | 2024-05-06 17:29:57 UTC | #18

Dear Dominic,

As always, read your thoughts is a real pleasure. Thanks a lot for this.

Simple question : does Dfinity have any visibility of the behavior of the *restakers* from the two extrema (6 months – 8years).

My point is : if the main part of the stakers getting the biggest rates of rewards restake all their rewards, the inflation is not a problem since it does not bring any sell pressure. 

For example, as an 8 years locked neurons owner myself, I have never sold any icp. I restake all my rewards. All of it. Since the beginning. If the main part of the 8 years stakers do the same, it means the main part the inflation due to them is kind of neutralized. 

My fear is that by these reductions, we create more inflation since : 
– those currently selling pressuring would continue selling ;
– more short-term stakers would be in invited in the game, potentially with the same behavior : selling ;
– by reducing the rewards of long term stakers, we make long-term stakers want to start to stake less or even unstake.

But I start from the assumptions that the long-term stakers restake, while the short-term stakers sell. Caricatural of course. But it is the limit case from which we need to start in order to check if these changes would be optimal or not even in that case. Before checking what is really the case. 

***Basically, we need to make those who restake, restake more and more, and make those who sell, sell less and less.***

Even if staking is a risk because the protocol is by design evolving (tokenomics included), so that **we can not complain by telling "I had been promised x %, I want them"** ; this seems very good (and necessary imho) to give confidence to past and future investors : 
[quote="dominicwilliams, post:10, topic:30352"]
Here’s what I would suggest might be done: adjust the way the dissolve_delay_bonus works for new staking, but not for neurons that are already staked.

I think i'd just sell my II and get out completely, this isn't what I believed and became sold into ICP for 8 years never dissolving

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-06 17:25:39 UTC | #22

This is not a “bonus” for us dominic, I invested 100k to buy 10.000 icp and locking it for 8years for a 16% understanding will decrease over time while the age bonus still got me in the same 16% after 4 years no dissolving.

I’m an investor not a gambler and this will affect my personal investment ROI in more than a 20%, the 20% reduction is from the 16% leaving the utility at 12% a year, and now decreasing from a 12% huge difference.

I wouldn’t locked for so many time if the main reason of locking that is get a revenue for doing so will be changed so easy. What is the second proposal about, it will leave the rewards as are today if adopted, no modification? There’s another proposal about reducing voting rewards if you don’t activate a new kind of “key” making impossible to sell the neuron, if you activate they key you have same rewards, if you don’t you cannot sell, what is all this about man? So were the tokenomics designed bad that now is a worry that
Affecting people’s investments? I love icp and am all in here, but you are affecting your first supporters because of the VC’s this proposals are not about inflation but to stop them from selling, then rebought their shares, but don’t affect us.

Clearly, your intention is improve all aspects of the project, but to be frank , the tokenomic should not even be discussed at all. What this post/proposal will achieve is to scare away any serious investor, now and in the future because it will forever create doubt on the stability of the rewards and foster doubt in the minds of serious investors. You are not doing any good with this no matter how good the proposal might be. Investors hate uncertainty.

I would say, create a proposal to black hole the tokenomics forever or at least 8years, then we can review it. 

Don’t kill this project by creating uncertainty

Agree, staked neurons MUST remain the same without affecting, just new neurons, stop affecting people’s investments, dominic you have probably millions of tokens you don’t worry about 20%, I have 10.000 it’s a huge lose, while I 100% trust and see icp long term potential, i’m leaving with 100k less money, that I could put on other investments not crypto related that gave me a better ROI and a fixed one not variable.

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 17:47:10 UTC | #26

Ok, so in your case as an 8Y, even though your dissolve delay would drop to 5, and you would get the same returns as a 5Y now (because your neuron age stays the same, etc). You would still feel it was a negative?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-05-06 17:49:05 UTC | #27

Option 1 makes sense to reduce inflation. I’d also argue it’s a good idea to just keep it simple and make the change on all existing and new neurons. Yes it’ll go down for some neurons, but c’est la vie. It doesn’t seem so drastic. 

Option 2 I’m less sure convinced by. As it exists today, one can make the argument maturity is not income. It’s not a slam dunk, but there is a reasonable argument. Introducing the withdrawal of locked ICP as a tax-neutral transaction, I fear will be viewed by the tax authorities as taking the piss. It seems to be going one step too far. Right now we have a good setup. Why push them over the edge?

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 17:50:43 UTC | #28

Would you feel the same way if the dissolve delay bonus was modified to benefit long stakers, such that after adjustment an 8Y-->5Y, your 5Y something more similar to 8Y?

(I'm not necessarily suggesting this, just asking)

-------------------------

System1 | 2024-05-06 17:51:04 UTC | #29

Most of us that went for 8yrs has no plans of ever dissolving, so bringing it down to 5yrs makes no difference to us. We already made plans with the 16% per annum. We only worry about anything that is reduced the rewards and affect our annual income

How many times do we reduce voting rewards, which is the primary incentivization of staking ICP & voting to secure the network, to offset the inflation caused by other factors of the network?

We’ve already been down this road once before.

1. Genesis and marketing towards 8 year gang
2. Some ppl believe in the project and go into 8 years stacking

Followed by the NNS screwing the tokenomics of the 8 year gang by the following proposal :  

3. Reducing comparative rewards by removing proportionality of the rewards / time
4. Fighting against the possiblity to trade neuron ( sorry it was obvious that it would be possible and will still be in the future btw ) This is again affecting 8 year gang the most
5. More proposal / intentions to change tokenomics during the years..
6. Finally this !!!!???

How could new investors trust long term investment in this protocol If people change the rules all the time ? What are even the gains ? Why would inflation even be an issue ? You sacrifice the trust in stability for some questionable gains ?

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-06 18:01:01 UTC | #33

Yes dom, when I decided to lock I made a investment plan like always, again I’m an investor, I understood that the curve would tend to go down, but in 4 years I would find the equilibrium point with the age bonus at an adjusted 16%, I never thought about dissolving since I understand the long-term potential, and I never thought about selling all the capital.

We can find a way to stop selling pressure from the big whales like VC’s in that’s the concern, but not affect us the ones in the middle, this I guarantee will create panic, personal experience, I used to run a crypto project too not that big, things went wrong once we decided to modified rewards. Created a panic sell pressure and lost confidence, once you lose confidence in your users and investors you are done..

Hi All

None of these proposals seem outrageous to me, do I do see @dfisher's point on the second one. My main question is: How much does the network have to grow to become stable or even deflationary at a certain reward level? The initial thought was that the network would surely generate at least 5% (eventually), if that's not the case and we're reducing it to something like 4% how much faster is it going to get the network to deflation/stability? What is the target? Deflation? 2% inflation like regular economies? 

I feel like without knowing those numbers/having a plan this might have to happen over and over.

-------------------------

Manu | 2024-05-06 18:05:41 UTC | #35

It sounds like the goal of this proposed change would be to reduce inflation. If that's the goal, I think we should *really* consider implementing the [periodic confirmation on following](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651). We still have < 60% participation on the governance topic since removing it from "all topics" [more than two years ago](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/44947). That suggests to me that implementing periodic confirmation would cut the inflation by 40% without affecting any active users.

@dominicwilliams  what if this applies to new neurons created after proposal approval, make a big marketing campaign by community where potential investors will see this as their last time to make them up with a 8year neuron, this instead of creating panic and selling pressure creates buying pressure in the weeks or months before proposal is made, as it will obviously pass as most of 8year neurons, and every other year neurons will vote to approve it.

AThis can apply to genesis neurons, and new neurons, also you said there are vcs not staked so I don’t see how reducing rewards for middle class will affect them.

-------------------------

Cogo | 2024-05-06 18:16:56 UTC | #41

aiv | 2024-05-06 18:18:04 UTC | #43

Overall, @dominicwilliams both of these ideas are extremely clever, it's awesome to see you thinking about things at this level!

I feel like a DAO should generally keep its promises. As long as existing 8 year neurons remain with the same dissolve delay and reward rate but new neurons could only stake up to 5 years, then all prior promises from the NNS to its users would be kept. In that case, I think there would be a generally strong amount of community support around both of these proposals.

The sensitive thing here is making sure confidence stays strong that governance rewards (and tokenomics in general) will remain fairly stable and not leave people feeling rugged.

Someone should be able to stake ICP, set it to follow a known neuron they trust, and then come back in 5 years with no surprises waiting for them. If that's not the case, a lot of people won't be as eager to stake because they'll feel that rules might be changed at any time from under them.

Also, while inflation is important I also see a lot of value in having as much ICP as possible remaining locked into the NNS.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 18:23:52 UTC | #45

I hear your concerns about tax authorities, but how authorities treat this kind of things comes down to tax law, and possible contest of points of law where things need clarifying (e.g. case law). The design of the current system doesn't enable tax avoidance, or reduce tax revenues that authorities receive (in fact, quite the opposite), but it can provide a much more workable framework that allows people to time when they generate taxable income.

Participants in NNS governance choose when they will engage in the production of new ICP/income. Unless they have a pressing need for funds, they will choose to do so when there is a buoyant market for the ICP they are creating. This results in the production of more income, and significantly more revenue for tax authorities over the long-term.

So tax authorities have no reason not to like the way the NNS is designed. However, in the end, tax law trumps all. The question is, when a neuron gains maturity, will the laws of your jurisdiction classify the neuron's maturity increasing as representing clearly realized income over which you have full dominion – I would argue mostly not, since it's not transferrable, has no quantifiable market value, the amount of ICP it will produce is indeterminate, and even the meaning of maturity can be changed by NNS updates/it's not a cryptocurrency. But where there's debate, in the end local courts have to resolve it, which is why it's important always to get your own tax advice. 

Going back to Option 2. There is nothing naughty about this either. If you release your own pre-existing locked ICP and pay capital gains when you sell it or swap it (which may happen sooner than later now) then you're paying the same kind of tax as when you dissolved your neuron. So from the tax authority's perspective, this is tax neutral.

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:6, topic:30352, full:true"]
People who have staked for 8 years, would see their maturity grow more slowly/get fewer rewards. However, if this scheme were adopted, they would only be locked for 5 years, and they’d been getting the same rewards that people locked for 5 years get today. In one sense this is a bonus for them: they rode the wave as 8 year neurons, getting those higher rewards, and now they are only locked for 5 years.
[/quote]

But i staked for 8 years and the plan was to never dissolve. Its the 8 year gang. And now my plan just goes away, i dont like that. I staked for 8 years and made up a strict plan for all of it, i want to keep my 8 year neurons and 8 year neuron rewards. Sorry to have a different opinion. 

I think 8 year neurons should stay in existence, and from that point on there shall only be 5 year neurons max, and those who staked for 8 years until that point can keep it.

Or those who have a 8 year neuron that is not dissolving until that point, should be able to keep it.
Something like that. As a thank you to the hardcore believers.

-------------------------

Roman | 2024-05-06 18:43:42 UTC | #53

But I I think that Dominic’s goal is less about reducing the inflation than reducing the selling pressure. And one could argue that the inflation due to people having « forgotten » their neurons and their following do not take part to this selling pressure. But I agree that this implementation is a double necessity : it has been asked and is a limit to inflation and selling pressure to come.

IC_Maximillion | 2024-05-08 17:52:09 UTC | #54

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:10, topic:30352"]
Here’s what I would suggest might be done: adjust the way the dissolve_delay_bonus works for new staking, but not for neurons that are already staked. So if there’s a 2 year neuron, it continues to have the same voting power before (unless it was Seed/ECT and is in the process of dissolving, since this cohort didn’t stake on the basis they would get some specific voting power, and no promise is being broken).

New staking would work according to the new scheme however.
[/quote]

Exactly: and the same system for all already existing neurons: They continue to be the same 6 monts to 8 year neurons, dissolving or undissolving and "*New staking would work according to the new scheme however.*" 
And the new scheme will NOT affect the neurons that are in existence before the new scheme got introduced.

Otherwise i am very dissappointed in who ever made such a proposal.
Im a 101% ICP Maxi, and really would be dissappointed if that would happen!
Why? Because i believed long term and decided to lock away my money basically forever 8 undissolving, its all strictly planned with my hard earned money. Something like that should not be able to happen.

Cryptobaasnl | 2024-05-06 18:44:33 UTC | #55

The 8 years gang is literally the strongest group of advocates/ promoters the internet computer can have i am concerned we gonna lose a lot of strong voices in the community i think we all can agree that we don't wanna see our investment getting diluted over time but we need to consider better option to reduce inflation IF it is really that big of a PROBLEM? is it? and i am confident we just giving outsiders another handle to say dfinity doesn't care about it's investors interest etc etc look at other ecosystems they are mostly flourishing because they have a loyal community because the get great inventive to do so... just sayin don't become what they want you to become..

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/periodic-followee-confirmation-follow-up/20290

I followed it here, however I was told there was a design flaw, to which I attempted to provide an amendment. Eventually DFINITY provided the following response, claiming the proposal is now void, under the premise that the primary objective was reducing spam:

[quote="lara, post:85, topic:20368, full:true"]
The [original proposal ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) about periodic followee confirmation was submitted and voted on with the main motivation to disencourage spam proposals. The proposal’s objective said *“This discrepancy in participation rates is an incentive to submit spam proposals for the purpose of receiving higher voting rewards […] This proposal aims to remove this incentive […]”*. Spam proposals in this context are proposals that are just sent to increase the rewards for some governance participants without having actionable content.

DFINITY voted yes on the proposal with the primary purpose of addressing spam concerns. Since the original proposal, the NNS achieved spam prevention by 1) an increase of the proposal fee and 2) adjusting the voting rewards as explained [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/financial-spam-prevention-nns-implementation-update/18917). Therefore, DFINITY no longer believes that spam, as defined above, is a concern at this time, so other areas deserve more design and engineering resources.

The [proposal ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) does provide other side effects some people like as well, but with the main motivation (spam) for it gone, it seems prudent to discuss whether it is actually the best solution for the aspects that before were more of a side-effect.

Therefore, we suggest that if periodic followee confirmation should be realized for a reason other than spam prevention, then this should again be put to voting on the NNS.

This would help with

* Understanding if the NNS voters agree with the new proposed goals.
* Understanding if the NNS voters see a need for this feature in the context of these new goals.
* Focussing the discussion on more concrete concerns and questions.

However, the background of the proposal depicts something different:

Haters will be haters. The Internet Computer community should continue to optimize the network, and network tokenomics, with aim of making everything better.

Of course, if the vast majority of the 8 Year Gang holders feel that being bumped down to 5Y neurons is somehow bait and switching them – because they never intended to dissolve – that makes this harder to do (not least because they would vote against it, and as usual DFINITY wouldn't vote on something like this, but because community harmony is important).

But currently, 8Y lockups would be reduced to 62.5% of what they are now (5Y), while maturity growth would be reduced to 80% of what they are now...  Arguably a great deal.

This equation stems from a disproportion in staking rewards though, which is something that has been agreed, so wouldn’t it be more responsible to start there?

If the goal is to decrease inflation, we need to address the leading factor; the lack of relationship between cycles burnt and node provider rewards, not reduce the incentivization for users to secure the network through voting.

**To avoid all of the problems that come with this idea:**

Let us keep our existing 6 month - 8 year neurons (without any changes made, dissolving or undissloving.) As a sign of recognition to the early believers and supporters.

From the date when the new scheme gets implemented, from that moment on, all the changes apply to newly created neurons. And those who existed before that will stay unchanged forever.


If the existing neurons get affected, many MANY people will get very VERY upset and dissappointed.
I am a 101% ICP Maxi and a 202% fan and look up to you @dominicwilliams , but if this happens with my 8 year neurons, i will be very dissappointed. I feel very bad having to read a idea like this.

let4be | 2024-05-06 19:06:35 UTC | #65

I very much wouldn't like my 8y neuron to turn into 5y with reduced rewards. 

Kind of knew what I was doing when I locked stake for 8 years and I planned accordingly - to never ever dissolve this neuron and make my game solely from the rewards it's printing

I also think it's important to keep core tokenomics of ICP more or less a constant - investors don't like uncertainty and unpredictability in assets they hold

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2024-05-06 19:08:20 UTC | #67

Do @Manu idea and this, I think this will solve everything with the inflation problems. Active members are consistently receiving rewards and additional inflation is reduced for new neurons. I think this fixes problems for neurons in place and inflation going forward.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-06 19:11:14 UTC | #68

@dominicwilliams  Dominic, I think you should have started with the second proposal. We humans tend to be susceptible to the first proposal we hear, and if it's negative, it affects our decision regarding the following proposals.

If I understand correctly, basically if I have 10,000 locked ICP in my neuron, and I have 1,000 in maturity (unstaked), I can exchange it for 1,000 ICP, leaving my neuron with 9,000 ICP and 1,000 in maturity but now (staked)?

Would my neuron still give me rewards for the same 10,000? (I know this depends on the voting power), but my question is, wouldn't this affect my rewards generated as they are currently being managed, where there is no distinction between liquid ICP and staked maturity when generating rewards?

I understand that this could contribute to selling pressure since if I need 10k, according to the example you gave, in these countries they would need to sell 12,500 USD to get 10,000, paying this 20% tax, whereas the way it has been handled so far they would have to sell 20,000 USD to get the same 10,000 USD after the 50% tax.


What if this is adopted (if works how I’m describing) and also the first proposal but just for new neurons, and genesis.?

-------------------------

Stepikthug | 2024-05-06 19:18:33 UTC | #70

I think that I’m OK with the eight year neuron that I have non-dissolving be converted to a five year however I think it would be good to create some sort of recognition to the original eight year gang neurons that have been staking for years. For instance, my neuron has been staking for three years already in non-dissolving status and it would be cool to keep that recognition on those neurons that have remained faithful from the beginning so I don’t see a problem with lowering the eight years to five memorable

Re: Proposal 1, I'm not pushing the idea particularly – I'm pretty ambivalent – but I wanted to make sure it was out there, and get some feedback. There are pros and cons obviously. The main pro is that it reduces inflation without changing how neurons work (i.e. given some locked ICP, some dissolve delay, and an age, the rate at which neuron maturity grows stays the same as before). The main con, which this discussion has elucidated somewhat, is that some people with 8Y neurons might feel bait and switched by being moved to a 5Y neuron, even though it would work the same as 5Y neuron today, and the age attribute wouldn't be reset by the reduction. Worth noting though that sometimes ideas like this can invoke fear on first sight, then over time seem more reasonable. Only way to know is to let them percolate :)

Re: Proposal 2, yup as you say, the two proposals are independent, and your analysis of the second proposal is correct. This would just provide a way of i) allowing people to use their pre-existing locked ICP to participate in e.g. DeFi, so they don't have to generate income to do that, and ii) selling less ICP when they need $x liquidity. I think it's a far less controversial idea, and really just a practical feature –although ideas like this need need careful analysis. For example, over the long-term, many neurons would just end up with maturity locked inside. But that's not to imply extra inflation I don't think, since when people use maturity to spawn new neurons, that puts new ICP on the ledger anyway.

I haven't read through ALL the comments but this re-tokenomics comes off (to me, anyway) as the scene from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation when Clark is expecting his annual bonus but gets enrolled into the jelly of the month club instead. 

When I staked my first Neuron way back when, I did it for 8 years because 1) it was paying about 28% APY if I remember correctly, and 2) Dfinity pretty much pleaded for us to do so to strengthen the network. Now, less than 3 years later we're already down 12% but still locked for 8 years. 

I've read some proposals in the past that would let the 8 year gang remain at 8 years with same tokenomics and changes would only affect new stakes. That seems a bit more fair to the OGs. Let's not rush into anything but continue the discussion.

I don't think it would be too bad as long as the periodic followee reset was at an easy-to-remember time, like every January 1st at the change of the year.

Also, if anyone complains that's not on DFINITY, the ecosystem had already adopted a proposal to approve this long ago so no one could blame you for implementing it.

The benefit here is that it strengthens NNS robustness by making sure people have to stay at least a little active, and once a year re-evaluate their follow settings. Inflation is reduced from the least active, rather than being reduced form the 8 year gang (who are often the most active).

3rd party tools could be built to help people auto-follow each January 1st if people really wanted to do that.

Also, I don't think it'll disrupt technical proposals since even known neurons like myself who always vote manually on everything still follow DFINITY's leadership on those. There's no other trustworthy authority on technical topics, so I don't see DFINITY ever losing the ability to make critical technical proposals quickly if needed to fix and issue in the network, which I think was one of the risks mentioned for why periodic followee reset was never implemented.

Dom has been very responsive and it seems they are genuinely collecting feedback and listening, if they didn't want to listen they wouldn't have posted on the forum.

Maybe walk outside and touch some grass, or smoke some, and come back with less harsh vibes, lol!

@ScouseWill79 reasonable question.

Fwiw, you can see it here:

it is less than 20% and decreasing constantly

@dominicwilliams since we’ve opened up the discussion I’d just like to state my position on this.

Over the course of 3 years many clever ideas have been proposed to not only reduce inflation, but also increase decentralization and incentivize participation.

I read two of your replies, one to @Manu and one to @Accumulating.icp, where you made it clear you were hesitant to support changes that might be perceived as “pulling the rug” on stakeholders. IMO this shouldn’t be a factor. What you’re proposing here is also being perceived that way.

This is not to say I don’t support your proposal. I do. But I think it only gets us half way there and if we’re going to overhaul governance let’s do it right. For me, doing it right means:

1. Reduce max dissolve delay to 5 years - I’ve always felt 8 was way too long.

2. Redistribute rewards so that 5 year dissolve is is getting rewards proportional to their commitment - this is honestly common sense and would help reduce the impact of the 20% hit.

3. Implement the periodic reconfirmation of follower settings - if people can set it and forget it then there really is no reason to be active. We’re defeating ourselves.

Just my $.02. Will be happy with whatever we as stakeholders decide

MotokoMartin | 2024-05-06 20:14:05 UTC | #100

This is probably the best way to go.
New neurons will be able to stake max 5 years -> "current" neurons who already stake for 8 years can keep their 8 year neurons.

I would recommend those 8 year neurons CAN NOT "top-up" their neurons, making it TRULY "og" neurons.

FYI: I do have a 8 year non dissolving neuron.

Keep in mind, this would also make our 8 year neurons MORE valuable if you would ever like to sell/transfer it.

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2024-05-06 20:15:29 UTC | #101

Very nice. Great idea, truly @MotokoMartin

-------------------------

jamesbeadle | 2024-05-06 20:16:32 UTC | #102

Have you factored in the potential increase burning of cycles through mass adoption of IC apps?

Surely this is the natural way to fight inflation, as you designed the system initially.

Why hedge against the coming mass adoption?

-------------------------

let4be | 2024-05-06 20:18:59 UTC | #103

I also don't quiet understand why current inflation and it's distribution/origin is the problem per-se... 

Yes, some of it creates sell pressure. So what?

-------------------------

Cryptobaasnl | 2024-05-06 20:19:19 UTC | #104

I agree dfinity should just keep focusing on Buidl.! 🤝🏼  We should implement the proposal that was adopted earlier and new staking participants will follow up on the new staking terms… i can only speak as me as individual investors but these changes could affect a lott of I. Project also depending on the staking rewards E.G GOLDdao FPLdao Stack and probably a lot more..

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2024-05-06 20:23:43 UTC | #105

re: Proposal 1, the idea could arguably work with these modifications:

1) All holders of neurons where dissolve delays is above 5Y, are given a one-time choice per neuron:
-- Drop to 5Y
-- Stay at >5Y (e.g. stay at 8Y)

2) After the change, it would become impossible to set the dissolve delay beyond 5Y on new or existing neurons (even though some early neurons would stay at 8Y because their owners want to maximize maturity growth and bought into that config)

3) Adjust the overall neuron reward down so that, given some amount of ICP locked, some age, and some dissolve delay, maturity continues growing at very nearly exactly the _same_ rate it does today 

This would still have some immediate impact, since I think many early people would probably hedge and allow some of their neurons to drop to 5Y, and obviously over a long period of time the impact would grow, because it wouldn't be possible to create new 8Y neurons.

[EDIT/UPDATE on seeing what MotokoMartin said]
4) And it would become impossible to top-up a neuron with >5Y dissolve delay (otherwise the change could be circumvented)

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-05-06 20:19:42 UTC | #106

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:61, topic:30352"]
But currently, 8Y lockups would be reduced to 62.5% of what they are now (5Y), while maturity growth would be reduced to 80% of what they are now… Arguably a great deal.
[/quote]

Fair point, it's a good deal but only if you ever plan on dissolving.

I have a 1,000 ICP 8 year neuron, and I'd rather keep the reward rate I have now and have it increase to a 100 year dissolve delay rather than have a 5 year dissolve delay and 20% reduction.

I'm probably a nutcase, but my goal was to someday live on neuron rewards without needing to dissolve.

I too would do, in fact i'd lock up for 1000 years

RMCS | 2024-05-06 20:22:28 UTC | #111

Would this also mean that maturity can't be added to the 5+ year neuron as wel?

-------------------------

1,000 year gang, lol! I'm pretty sure that would get some PR! :raised_hands:

-------------------------

let4be | 2024-05-06 20:24:57 UTC | #113

This basically resolves any issues I might have with such change - just let me keep my shiny never dissolving 8y neuron that would gain maturity on same rules it gains now.

More over if it's implemented this way(with owners of neurons having a choice) - it creates a precendent that if major tokenomics changes do occur, pre-existing "contracts" are still honored, and this is important from investor point of view(less unpredictability and chaos)

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-05-06 20:25:11 UTC | #114

I wouldn't think so since staked maturity is already distinct from the neuron's ICP balance.

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2024-05-06 20:26:56 UTC | #115

Thank you, i truly appreciate the reply. 
This would be the dream scenario, and people would appreciate it because they are given a one-time choice.

And as MotokoMartin said, And it would become impossible to top-up neurons above 5 years.


Everybody would be very happy with that, because they are given a one-time choice, like you said.

 **That would be truly epic.** :smiley: :+1: :pray:

-------------------------

RMCS | 2024-05-06 20:30:04 UTC | #116

But it does apply to the same rules as the neuron its coming from, right?

@dominicwilliams I am an 8 year staker (I know you know this, so mostly saying this more for readers lol) so this would affect me directly and I am still not sure how I feel about the proposals. I need to let them brew longer for my particular case and see how I feel. I am actively reading and considering as this proposal is new to me.

One thing I have found for myself and others is that a lot of times these conversations & proposals can get scary to readers because of the numbers being discussed.

Following the idea of iterative nature of the NNS DAO, do you think it could be **wise** to make smaller changes, give it X months, evaluate and then double down if they work? People may be less afraid of reducing things to 62% if they had already reduced to 90% and the 80% and then 70%, at each point seeing that the world didnt crash (or inversely, maybe even reducing to 90% was too painful).

To argue against myself, the **above may not be wise** because a small percentage change may be too small to see a positive impact on. If an elected official were elected one week at a time, one can see how that person would never get anything done.

Curious on your thoughts.

(I should note my bias: my controversial "hot take" is that I *suspect* that the ICP DAO should embrace more iteration as design meets the world, so I am always thinking about the wisdom of too little vs too much rigidity).

@dominicwilliams I am in favor of a "grand-fathering" in of the original (current) 8-year Neurons as a Thank You to original investors.

My suggestion would be:
After X date the cap is now 5 years.
Original 5+ (up to 8) year non-dissolving neurons get the option of keeping their status as such with an option of lowering to 5 years + accrued age due to difference in downscaling. If they are EVER dissolved, their cap will automatically be tied to the new limit of 5 years, and they can no longer increase their delay beyond 5 years.

For example: if someone chose to dissolve an 8 year neuron and changed their mind a month later, it would be scaled down to 5 years over the next 2 years and 11 months and it would stay there. In such a scenario, it would probably make sense that they lost their age bonus aswell, but had it reaccrue over the next 2 years and 11 months because the age cap is what is decreasing (and what they actually lost) while they are still staking as the new maximum of 5 years.

The upside of this system is a few things:
1. You reward your early adopters.
2. You heavily decentivize the 8-year-gang from considering leaving, because any 8-year-gang neuron would immediately be hit by a 3-year cap decrease (and possibly an immediate loss of their age-bonus along the way down).
3. You actually put the VC's in a position, where their pump-n-dump plans work to their disadvantage, because grand-fathered neurons would be very valuable, but also stable for the entire system as a whole.

Sure, you might still have to adjust some rates, and sure it could seem "unfair" that someone are inherently at an advantage, because they were "early", but keep in mind, that with this system, you are literally only rewarded for staying loyal, and if you - even for a split second - dissolve your neuron, the rewards are lost permanently, and the neuron is no longer "grandfathered" - it is just another neuron, like the 99% who didn't believe in ICP while it was in it's infancy.


EDIT 1: I am in favor of the second proposal (about using maturity to "free up" locked ICP).
EDIT 2: What I wrote about also in no way takes into consideration, the actual NNS value of voting power, which could probably discussed as a separate issue.

Change for new neurons. Leave the existing as they are.

-------------------------

jonit | 2024-05-06 20:33:03 UTC | #123

Dont we need a model here of how reducing inflation potentially effects the price of ICP?

-------------------------

aiv | 2024-05-06 20:35:06 UTC | #124

Having an advantage for being early is basically a law of nature and crypto 101.
