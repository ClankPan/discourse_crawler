Hello everyone

I'm not able to deploy my app to playground due to failure with internet identity canister, ever since I added login.
I even updated the DFX version (0.20.0) and started dfx as cleaned, but still getting the same error 

To fix the original error (not mentioning it here), someone on Discord told me to download II WASM and and to updated my dfx.json but I started getting a different error. After no update there, I have decided to try my luck here

> Instruction from Discord

> In the field `wasm` , you can see a link, copy that link paste on your browser. A file will be downloaded. then move it to your project folder. use `gunzip internet_identity.wasm.gz` . now in the `dfx.json` file specify the path to your wasm.

> command: dfx deploy --network playground

As the error message said, the II canister is too large to deploy on the playground. You can deploy it to IC directly without using playground. The canisters deployed in playground will still be able to access your II canister, as it's all running on the mainnet.

but I need cycles to deploy to mainnet right ?. I'm not ready for that yet. I have the cycles from the coupon but dont want to use them yet

“remote”: {
“id”: {
“ic”: “rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai”
}
},
[/quote]

Change this to:

```
"remote": {
  "id": {
    "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai",
    "playground": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
  }
},
```

That will prevent DFX from trying to deploy II to the playground and you can use the one that's already deployed on Mainnet instead.
