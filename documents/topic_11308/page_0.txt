Does candid support a 'dynamic' record/mapping of key value pairs that arent predefined?
From what I can see candid only supports records where all the keys and types are predefined rather than being dynamic.
My current solution is just create tuples for key and value, but just wanted to sure i wasn't missing something.
(also if IS supported, how does one do that in Motoko)

No, I don’t believe it does.

What you’re doing with a list of key-value pairs is exactly what is described here in how to perform an upgrade when using a `HashMap`, in case it helps:
