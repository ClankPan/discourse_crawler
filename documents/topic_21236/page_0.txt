Hello everyone,

We've been researching ways of standardizing how to decentralize the Domain Name System (DNS) and have a standard for name lookups. Now, we're excited to elevate our discoveries together with what we've named as the Chain Name System, or CNS.

We're establishing this working group to collaborate with many of you and existing projects such as ICNS and IC Naming to further advance this topic.

**Topic:** Naming System
**DFINITY lead:** @Kepler 
**Coordinator:** @domwoe 
**Cadence:** Monthly on the last Thursday of every month at 10 am CET
**First meeting:** July 27th, 2023
**Calendar:** [link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_cgoeq917rpeap7vse3is1hl310%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FZurich)
**Discord:** [naming-system](https://discord.com/channels/748416164832608337/1126922188742729948)
**Resources:** [Working Group: Naming System](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IycBTRpgtpvfM5HyShME1vNMPlGGCqUM)

There are several use cases that a verifiable naming system could provide, namely, having a friendly name to resolve canisters, dedicated servers, wallet addresses and much more. 

I'm looking forward to your participation and can't wait to see what we can achieve together.

Let's set the standards for the mentioned topics and many more that will surface enabling a decentralized future that is resilient and efficient to the naming system that we all use every day.

Hope to see you there!

bright! It would be great if we could use **.icp** domains in a simple way on a website.

.icp domains I think should be the standard for ICP

Thank you so much !

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-07-10 08:32:13 UTC | #3

We are aiming to create standards on how the naming system could operate leveraging properties from the Internet Computer, different Top-level domain operators can emerge from that (e.g. .icp as you mentioned).

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-10-25 12:12:43 UTC | #10

Hi Everyone, for tomorrow Working Group meeting we would like to go over the Governance structure of CNS and more specifically the committee privileges, as well as, extending the lookup spec to allow for upgrade to update call that would facilitate other use cases such as integrating with other blockchains.

Looking forward to seeing you there.

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-10-26 13:24:53 UTC | #11

Today's meeting had lower attendance than usual, so we've decided to post the topics we were planning to discuss here. Your input is crucial for shaping these areas, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.

**These were the topics on the agenda today:**

- [Draft Proposal of the Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sN4FQKGYNc_gfaOG8omE9xWTUPuVHlUs4eZ_SY91izs/edit) aspects of CNS and as discussed in a previous meeting the access breakdown is also added under it's [respective section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sN4FQKGYNc_gfaOG8omE9xWTUPuVHlUs4eZ_SY91izs/edit#heading=h.twp8ky38x7si).

- Adding to the [DomainLookup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ylP1o4yT_urgA7kvKAT31fOQHSIpDVV5ZCMEKRPpMTA/edit#heading=h.kh8xm5fid8mb) a possibility to do upgrade to update calls, this features would facilitate use cases such as enabling fetching a domain records from other sources and adding it to a cache within the specified TTL.

Your involvement is key to moving CNS forward.

Hello, I want to ask about ICnaming https://www.icnaming.com/ information? has it stopped working?

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-11-28 10:45:28 UTC | #13

Hi @Tony89, i would suggest to try their [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/913727334878695424/918368082735546418) to clarify your questions regarding IC Naming.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-11-28 16:32:14 UTC | #14

Hi @Kepler do you mind summarizing how the CNS is going? Do we have an action plan going forward and a date in mind for implementation?

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-11-29 08:38:53 UTC | #15

Hi @dfisher,

We have started to develop the name registry canister based in the [proposed specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ylP1o4yT_urgA7kvKAT31fOQHSIpDVV5ZCMEKRPpMTA/edit), this will serve as a common layer for the remaining CNS canisters such as the CNS Root and TLD canisters.

The initial plan is to develop that canister with DNSSEC support that will leverage tECDSA to sign the records so that later on we are able to implement the `ic-cns-resolver` library that will be used by the clients to resolve the records and verify the signatures using the public key of the canister (similar to how traditional DNS works).

Once those are in place we plan to start working on the CNS Root that will be used as the root of the CNS tree and will be used to resolve the available TLDs to their corresponding canisters. This will in turn allow us to release the resolver library that can be used by the clients, we plan to integrate that with the [Local IC HTTP Proxy](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/try-out-the-ic-http-proxy-a-leap-towards-decentralized-http/20357).

We are also looking into the possibility of integrating ENS as a TLD canister to allow the resolution of `.eth` domains for CNS clients.

Another topic of interest is the Governance side of CNS, we have an initial [Governance Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sN4FQKGYNc_gfaOG8omE9xWTUPuVHlUs4eZ_SY91izs/edit) of how it would work but the initial version won't have it implemented yet.

Regarding timeline we are currently pointing at H1 2024, but is subject to change as we progress with the development and due to other competing priorities.

We will be sharing more details as we progress with the development.

cryptodriver | 2023-11-29 09:19:21 UTC | #16

Why don't you get a top domain .icp like .com to make the naming-service to real one?
I think you should do this ASAP.

-------------------------

Kepler | 2023-11-29 09:37:53 UTC | #17

Getting a top level domain like `.icp` that is resolvable without end user changes would require that the TLD would be acquired as a [gTLD](https://icannwiki.org/Generic_top-level_domain) through ICANN since existing DNS resolvers use ICANN Root Servers as the entry point, that is definitely a viable route if ICANN would open up for applicants again ([next round is announced for Q2 2026](https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/next-round)), currently it's still closed since 2012.

This however would still be centralized under ICANN, CNS aims to tackle that centralization issue by managing the Root through a DAO. The TLDs under CNS would then be able to offer what we are describing as gateway domains, and some legal entity that could own something like `.icp` under ICANN could then mirror the domains in CNS to enable clients to resolve domains without additional configuration.

-------------------------

JMVR | 2023-12-19 14:49:08 UTC | #18

What happened with the ICNS team? We are trying to reach them in all medias and no response. .icp domains that we have paid can’t be renew either. Whats going can you take over this project?

Arthur2 | 2023-12-22 04:32:03 UTC | #20

Hello Everyone,
I come here because this is one of the most vital topics to address.  Now im trying to be objective, but 3rd party projects are not equal.  There is a reason Dominic Williams uses "dom.icp" on his X account, and why half of the team does as well, as well as many pro ICP influencers.  It's because when you explain ICP to a layperson the easiest way (and we all know this) is to say "well you can host websites on it"  It's something that's readily understandable and will 100% be the only reason that ICP gains widespread adoption.

So on that note I"d like to bring the case of ICNS up to everyone.  The project was developed by Psychadelic, and gained quite a lot of traction, but then they ultimately reneged (i believe they just wanted to milk some free ICP and leave) and handed it over to a few devs who were apparently incapable of running it due to not enough ICP coming in (although I know that this is not the case).  With that being said, those devs simply dropped the project, and people who have .icp domains are no longer capable of renewing them, nor buying new ones.  

For those that don't know, there are 2 naming NFT's out there, they are the .ic crowd, and the .icp crowd.  And I understand dfinity's position that "well it's all 3rd party so let the market sort it out" however, there's one very important fact, and that's visibility and marketing of ICP.  If it's absolutely obvious to us all, that the entire upper level Dfinity team uses .icp on their X accounts, wants to be associated with .icp, and prefers it as a represenation of themselves within the icp ecosystem, then it's absolutely obvious to me which one represents ICP better, and that's the .icp naming system.

For this reason, and considering that ICNS (those who issue .icp domains) is completely abandoned, I believe that Dfinity should take over the ICNS project, and lead it themselves.  This will promote 1. A source of revenue, and 2. a safety net, because Dfinity's enemies won't use the failure of .icp as a very vibrat example of a absolute incompetence of the ICP team itself.

I strongly suggest that the dev and dfinity team doesn't just treat this as "just another 3rd party app" and instead take it over and manage it because it is 100% the flagship selling point of ICP itself.

If the common man, who currently hosts websites for small business for 200-300/year via godaddy (mcap of 15b) learns of $5/yr, there will be a VIOLENT influx of people into ICP for websites, and those common middle class folks will be putting 10s of thousands of liquidity into purchasing ICP.

Please, if you're reading this and you're on the Dfinity team, can you get this message over to someone who can make a decision on this?  I can't post in various categories apparently other than general, but this needs to 100% be addressed, and addressed fast. 

P.S.

Idea for a Dapp is a "wordpress" for .icp websites, so the common man with no programming knowledge can use that app to develop his websites seamlessly.  IMO that'll make ICP itself viral AF for all middle class working people who have smalltime websites and pay 100s of dollars per year for them.

-------------------------

KFW | 2023-12-22 13:58:55 UTC | #21

I also would like to ask Dfinity to find a solution for the ICNS project that was simply abandoned by its devs.

-------------------------

maria | 2023-12-22 14:39:24 UTC | #22

Thanks a lot for bringing this up! We agree that this is an important matter!

We will discuss it at DFINITY and will come back with a proposal/suggestion right after the holidays since many people are already on a Xmas break right now. 

Wishing everyone Happy Holidays and a nice break!

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-12-22 17:32:10 UTC | #23

I fully agree with this and I’m sure many in the community do as well. @maria am glad you also agree and look forward to hearing Dfinity’s thoughts

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2024-01-06 23:43:44 UTC | #24

Hi Maria,

Any update regarding the proposal/suggestion?

-------------------------

vonSaar | 2024-01-07 12:10:15 UTC | #25

Hello everyone, especially Definity team,

as a big supporter and investor of ICNS, I completely agree with Arthur2.
I think it is a great shame, especially at a time when ICP is becoming more widely known not only in the crypto community, that there is no working .icp naming system.

Could you please help us contact and wake up the developers of this project, or suggest other functional solutions.

Thnx and have a good new year!

-------------------------

Arthur2 | 2024-01-17 11:21:43 UTC | #26

Hi Maria,

Did you guys get a chance to review this and come up with a proposal/suggestion?

Thank you in advance.

JMVR | 2024-01-17 12:04:46 UTC | #27

Hello @maria,  Any news about ICNS case ?

-------------------------

maria | 2024-01-17 15:12:13 UTC | #28

Yes, sorry for the delay, we are preparing it this week to be ready to propose something next week or so. Stay tuned. We also reached out to Rocklabs last week (to understand better their position), but did not hear from them yet.

-------------------------

Kepler | 2024-01-26 19:17:23 UTC | #29

**Hello everyone,**

I'm writing to let you know the decision we've made with regards to ICNS and an Internet Computer based Naming System.

Firstly, we managed to contact Rocklabs regarding ICNS. However, **we have decided not to take it over**. As far as we understand Rocklabs has ceased any further development on ICNS, but we welcome them to comment on this thread if they wish to provide any further information.

The topic of a naming system is undoubtedly significant for us. We are actively planning to address this through the development of CNS (Chain Name System), guided by the specifications we've been discussing in the Working Group. However, at present, our engineering resources have competing priorities and are assigned for other critical projects within the foundation. This means that our work on the CNS will have to wait until these resources are available again.

Once we resume our focus on CNS, our initial goal is to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that integrates seamlessly with the local [IC HTTP Proxy](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/try-out-the-ic-http-proxy-a-leap-towards-decentralized-http/20357). This integration will enable the direct resolution of Top-Level Domains (TLDs) managed by CNS from the browser. In addition, we plan to develop a comprehensive library that will facilitate the efforts of resolving domain records for a variety of applications, including HTTP Gateways, wallet address resolution, and establishing globally unique usernames, among others that the community may find useful.

As part of the MVP phase, it's a logical next step to provide a reference implementation for TLD Operators. In this context, DFINITY will propose to serve as the TLD Operator for `.icp` Top-level domain under the CNS ecosystem.

Our overarching goal with the CNS architecture is to establish a secure, stable, and resilient naming system. A key aspect of our approach is to ensure continuity and stability, even in scenarios where TLD Operators discontinue their services. To this end, we have started the discussions on that [governance model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sN4FQKGYNc_gfaOG8omE9xWTUPuVHlUs4eZ_SY91izs/edit) in the working group. This model is designed to maintain the integrity and functionality of domains, irrespective of the operational status of individual TLD Operators.

Unfortunately, the current situation with ICNS does not reflect these governance standards. However, we are confident that our proposed CNS architecture and governance model will address these concerns effectively, paving the way for a reliable and community-driven naming system.

We will keep you updated on our progress with CNS. In the meantime, we encourage you to continue the discussions within the working group.

**Best regards,**

Thank you. 

Lots of folks have already spent money on ICNS. Can there be some kind of reserving system for people to get their name on the CNS if they own it on ICNS? 

That would be an elegant takeover.

[/quote]

I think a lot of those name reservations have expired and you can't renew because it requires WICP and/or the ICNS system is down.  The .icp name still shows up in Plug Wallet as an NFT though.  I agree it would be nice if those ICNS names could be reserved for the new CNS.

-------------------------

JMVR | 2024-01-29 13:26:49 UTC | #32

That would be fair, reserving those names for the ones that had already payed for having them.

-------------------------

KFW | 2024-01-31 08:03:14 UTC | #33

OK, that was really disappointing to say the least. I get that Dfinity is working on a better solution but I (and others) have paid a lot of money on ICNS IDs so don't you think we deserve at least a refund from the ICNS team? I was hoping that's the minimum Dfinity can do for this community, to put some pressure on RockLabs for a fair resolution of the situation.
This makes everyone in the IC ecosystem look really bad to say the least.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-01-31 10:19:06 UTC | #34

You can’t expect dfinity to refund us for another project that has nothing to do with them. 

That said, you can expect dfinity to reserve names for people based on ICNS. 

The latter suggestion is respectful. The former suggestion is unrealistic.

-------------------------

KFW | 2024-02-01 10:46:45 UTC | #35

When did I say that Dfinity needs to refund us? I don't see why you felt like that, I was clearly referring to RockLabs.

-------------------------

HomerShillson | 2024-02-04 11:27:31 UTC | #36

I love this idea. But I'd like to speak as an ICNS huge holder, I'm sorry you didn't take on this project. What if we as ICNS domain holders could receive domains on CNS for free or maybe reserved its names? It would be fair if we bought these domains already 2 years back and use them in Plug wallet. Thank you fro consider this. Appreciate your work.

-------------------------

markicp1 | 2024-02-04 16:55:29 UTC | #37

This is great news.

Also have some ICNS domains and honoring those being brought over would be great!

-------------------------

Kepler | 2024-03-28 11:07:47 UTC | #38

Hello everyone,

After some reflection, we've decided to pause our monthly working group meetings for the next few months. This break will allow us to better align our resources and focus on our immediate priorities.

We value the discussions and insights from this group and plan to resume meetings with fresh perspectives and renewed energy. We'll keep you informed on when the meetings will restart.

Thank you for your understanding and continued commitment to the project. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or ideas in the meantime.

Best regards

Arthur2 | 2024-04-24 09:25:24 UTC | #39

Hi Everyone!

I've lost as much if not more than most of you on the ICNS scam (as it turned out).  Things like this happen in a high-risk high-reward environment.  However let us be fair to the Dfinity team.  First and foremost its ludacris to think that our ICNS domains should transfer over to real CNS domains.  This is because CNS was a small time group that nobody heard of and that had zero marketing, and those of us that got in, basically were able to obtain domains for pennies on the dollar.

Do you wish to now make a claim to something that Dfinity itself will market as a result?  That's foolish and greedy my friends. It's not an equivalent product and we can't reserve the real deal for having basically an NFT from a scam artist.

I propose a domain system where each of us who owns a ICNS name (it's still in our Plug although we can't renew it) to submit in writing for one domain out of all of the ones we own and have a multiplier on it for the auction phase, or for our purchase price.

For instance, if someone owns starbucks.icp netflix.icp youtube.icp etc etc etc, they would have to pick one, and submit in writing that they would like a multiplier NFT for the auction.

Now when the auction happens, their value would have a 2x multiplier.  Say 3 people bid.  One for $1000 for netflix.icp, one for $900, and the person with the netflix.icp 2x multiplier bids $600, he'd win that bid.  If however someone else put up $1300 for that domain, then the 2x multiplier nft would be consumed (it's single use) and the user wouldn't own that domain.

I think this is the only fair way to do this, or something along those lines.  This is because simply because you heard of ICNS first (due to friendships/connections etc) doesn't mean that you should own the real deal sites like google.icp youtube.icp etc etc etc.  You (and I) got in first to a scam, and a 2x NFT might help us, but i don't think that even the 2x NFT would go to far because we simply can't afford a lot of these domains.

From Dfinity's perspective its clear that they want to have a big push into .icp down the road, and when they start to auction sites like "google.icp" and "youtube.icp" it will bring in 100s of thousands of dollars, and that'll all go towards further R&D of ICP itself, as well as the website features that the rest of us will still capitalize on due to being so early. 

 @Kepler I would like to suggest that you make this a quicker priority because the crowd Dfinity is now trying to reach cannot possibly be larger than the crowd of people who need personal websites for as cheap as data hosting is.  There are millions of mom and pop stores that currently pay $200-300 a year for their godaddy comains and that market will not only buy theirowndomain.icp but will also inject a lot of capital into ICP via investments.

Just something to consider

-------------------------
