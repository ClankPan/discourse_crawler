There's an older topic on this issue but it was not resolved.

I have started to get "Cannot find canister xyz" when calling commands on a Canister that is up and running and has been for many months.

I can issue a "dfx canister --network ic status xyz" command and this returns valid data - but when I try and call a method on the Canister dfx says that it cannot find it.

Any ideas as I need to get access to this Canister?

Can you copy/paste the exact commands you used and the concrete error message? This sounds really weird and may be a typo thing or  something like that.
Another thing: are you using a canister principal or an alias? If you use an alias and don't call this from the same folder where `dfx.json` is located, dfx will not be able to translate the alias to a principal.
