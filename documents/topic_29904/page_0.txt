Dear ELNA Community Members,

This is the official proposal for the airdrop of new SNS tokens to our old ELNA token holders. This initiative is in line with our commitment to rewarding our loyal and OG community members and ensuring a smooth transition to the new ELNA DAO structure.

The ELNA DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, first of its kind in the world of AI, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this innovation. As part of our commitment to our community, we propose the following airdrop plan:

1. **Rewards for Pre-SNS Token Holders**: All pre-SNS token holders will receive new SNS coins as part of the airdrop. These tokens will be distributed in proportion to their current holdings. The airdrop will commence in the 4th week of April 2024, following the passing of the proposal.
2. **Rewards for LBP Token Holders**: LBP (Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool) token holders will receive rewards as promised - returns of 20x for LBP1 token holders and returns of 5x for LBP2 token holders.
3. **Token Allocation**: The total supply of ELNA DAO tokens will be distributed in the following manner:

  * 50.70% will be reserved for the SNS treasury.
  * 25.00% will be allocated to the community fund through the NNS-run decentralization swap.
  * 15% will be allocated to the ELNA founding team, which will vest over 36 months.
  * 3% will be allocated to seed investors, vesting over 36 months.
  * 5.3% will be allocated to LBP participants .

4. **Airdrop Mechanics**: The airdrop will be conducted in a fair and transparent manner. All eligible participants will receive their new SNS coins directly to their wallets.

We believe this airdrop will not only reward our loyal community members but also help us achieve our ambitious goals for the next six months. We are committed to fostering a strong and supportive community and look forward to your support in this endeavor.

Please vote on this proposal and share your thoughts and feedback. We value your input and are always open to suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely, The ELNA DAO Team
