(A long time ago) when I installed `dfx` for the first time I had issue with permission too on my mac.

I got these fixed by running few `chown` and `chmod` in order to run it without `sudo` (as for `npm` I guess it's safer to not use it). Documented these in this thread -> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/permissions-on-osx/5853/2?u=peterparker

Hope it helps a bit.

Happy new year ðŸ¥³
