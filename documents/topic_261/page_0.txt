Moritz and I thought we'd start a thread for simple programming exercises, feel free to share any you come across.

In particular any you've worked through that revealed something interesting about Motoko would be useful, or some exercises that have a functional programming slant.

It‘d be nice to get a list going that everyone can dip into when looking for things to try while exploring the language.

There’s a good list of general exercises to try here, if any of these lead to a particular approach with Motoko it'd be interesting to hear: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html
