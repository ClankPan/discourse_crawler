Hi! I'm planning on making calls to the OpenAI api endpoints, but currently the limitation on IPv4 destinations is a blocker. Is there any proxy solution that I can use to get around this?
If not, would it be sensible to write an off-chain proxy between the canister and the openai api endpoints? (I'm really trying to avoid any off-chain component)

For OpenAI, you need a proxy anyway because, in addition to not supporting IPv6, they also do not support idempotent answers.

Various solutions were shared on the forum. @zensh literally shared a solution today: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/idempotent-proxy-show-proxy-https-outcalls-to-any-web2-service/32754

Additionally, @massimoalbarello and @ilbert also provide solutions. You might find it documented them in this thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/non-replicated-https-outcalls/26627 or I'm sure they will be happy to share more information as well.

I would go with one of those solutions. However, if you are really looking for something else, like coding it yourself, you can have a look at my experiment where I coded some serverless functions on Firebase as a proxy. But that's more for hacking around: [https://github.com/peterpeterparker/juno-openai](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/juno-openai)

Thanks for sharing these resources! They are exactly what I needed ;)
