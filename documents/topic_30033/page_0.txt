Hey guys, quick update on [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/requesting-feedback-for-our-sns-dashboard/29612) - We've fixed the bugs that led to showing negative APY rates, we've parallel begun a full UI/UX revamp of the current dashboard. 

The completed dashboard should go live mid-May. Here is a working [link](https://bp3vo-2iaaa-aaaam-acicq-cai.icp0.io/) to just play around and point out any other bugs/feedback you want us to incorporate!
