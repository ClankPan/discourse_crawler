* Consensus: refactor(consensus): Use random id to index completed ecdsa signatures
* Crypto: feat(crypto): rotate IDKG dealing encryption key pair
* Crypto: feat(crypto): Change check_keys_locally to use idkg dealing enc key vector
* Crypto: feat(crypto): introduce time source in crypto component
* Crypto: feat(crypto): Change key pair generation functions to directly store public keys in local store
* Crypto: feat(crypto): Implement CSP vault API for obtaining public random seeds
* Execution: chore: Log cycle-related operations.
* Execution: feat: Add bitcoin mainnet canister IDs to config.
* Execution: feat: Expand stable storage to 48GiB
* Execution: fix: Use the correct the label name for submitted management requests
* Message Routing: Move non-thread safe Tip functionality out of StateLayout
* Networking: chore: Add network metrics to canister http adapter
* Networking: chore: Capacity evaluation out of experiment runs into report gen. [benchmark]
* Networking: docs: add some module level documentation for the chunkable modude
* Networking: feat: [H2][Tests] [1/2] Refactor helper methods
* Networking: fix: Account for headers in canister http request
* Networking: fix: Add load shedding to the metrics endpoint
* Networking: fix: Avoid the copy of the transport payload when we send the bytes over H2
* Networking: fix: Backoff if transport client handshake fails
* Networking: fix: Don't leak the ic_registry_transport:Error across API boundaries
* Node: Update cgi listen to listen on all interfaces
* Orchestrator: Periodically check for key rotations if node is part of a tECDSA subnet
* Orchestrator: Remove `release_package_url` from the protobuf
* Orchestrator: Generate key for rotation and load balance registration attempts
* Orchestrator: feat(registry,): update IDKG key
* Orchestrator: perf(orchestrator): Remove unnecessary signature clones
* Runtime: Reimplement canister instrumentation with `parity-wasm` replacement
* Runtime: Reset long_execution_mode on DTS abort
* Runtime: Share parsed wasm in validation/instrumentation
* Runtime: Upgrade wasm-encoder and wasmparser
* Various tech-debt management: code refactoring, docs, bug fixes, test updates
