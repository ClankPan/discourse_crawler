## Dfx 0.16.1 is promoted. You can read the release notes [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/releases/tag/0.16.1).

We're releasing this version so quickly after 0.16.0 because of [this bug](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/major-bug-in-dfx-0-16-0-with-azle/26957) found by @lastmjs. The new release contains a fixed replica.

Please let us know if you run into any problems
