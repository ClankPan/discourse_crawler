Dear IC developer comrades!
Found that motoko has a new library base/Timer recently,
There is a question about this library, as in title.
Let me give you an example:
Execute a task after 30 minutes when Timer.setTimer is set, but in the middle of the process, say after 10 minutes there is a container upgrade/or restart. So will this scheduled task continue to execute after the upgrade, or will it be lost?

Documentation [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/periodic-tasks#timers-library-limitations) says:

During the canister upgrade, a fresh WebAssemble state is created, all the timers are deactivated and the list of timers is cleared. It is up to the canister developer to serialize the timers in the `canister_pre_upgrade` and reactivate them in the `canister_post_upgrade` method if needed.

Currently "During the canister upgrade, a fresh WebAssemble state is created, all the timers are deactivated and the list of timers is cleared" from https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/periodic-tasks#timers-library-limitations
