Sadly, you’re still hoping to deflate ICP by burning consumption. What you don’t know is that its current burn amount is nothing compared to inflation. The plunge in ICP prices only brings about the loss of confidence and the loss of developers. Tokenism is so important in the cryto world, that’s why ETH is deflation, Dfinity team can’t understand this. Inflation brings more tokens, which causes the price of the currency to fall much more than the price of the currency caused by a little bit of deflation. You should better understand the magnitude of inflation and the magnitude of deflation.
