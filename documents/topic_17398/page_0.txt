### TL;DR

We intend to vote NO on the motion proposal for NNS Principles #96475 for formal reasons. In particular, we believe that there should be a path from proposal to code running on the IC, which does not seem to be the case for this proposal.

### What we liked about the proposal

The proposal touches on a very important point: How do we explain in a concise way to outsiders of the IC how the community thinks and how the IC could evolve over time? Formulating voting principles could be a useful vehicle for that.

### Why we are voting NO

As per our earlier communication on the [voting principles](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-58907/12868) of DFINITY, we believe that governance proposals should be tangible & achievable and that there should be a ”path from proposal to code running on the IC”.

As per our interpretation, the proposal for [NNS principles](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/96475?p=2&t=21) does not meet this criterion, because it focuses on meta aspects of the voting process, by establishing principles as “a way for the NNS to signal its future voting intentions”. This feedback is aligned with [points](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-governance/15584/52) raised earlier in the governance working group.

A secondary argument is that NNS principles are in any case not enforceable.

### We want to be clear in what this means and does not mean

While we vote NO on the proposal, we think it is a reasonable proposal created in good faith. We also very much appreciate the careful syndication of this proposal, which included concise write-ups, forum deliberation, and presentations in the governance working group & in Twitter spaces. 

### Further comments

We would like to point out that readily available voting principles could be useful on the level of known neurons. For example, it might be very helpful for NNS participants if the interface for choosing followees in the NNS app, could link to the voting principles of known neurons.

@bjoernek to say this is very disappointing is an understatement.

This proposal literally came out of a discussion I had WITH YOU during the Governance Working Group DFINITY hosts, and with the governance group's approval.

Where were these objections in the 2 months of leading up to the proposal when we did our due diligence? Why should anyone ever put this much work into a proposal again, just to have DFINITY unexpectantly shoot it down, only to give an explanation after the fact?

Frankly, I feel your explanation doesn't include whatever DFINITY's real reasons for rejecting this proposal are.

To not bring up these concerns for months, and to wait to explain them until only after placing a vote to reject, means you don't want to have to argue the merit of your decision ahead of time. Why exactly is that?

**Why your reasons for voting no make no sense**

* The whole point of the proposals was to provide a framework for submitting proposals would "lead to code running on the IC". Right now we have no common ground we can use to objectively argue to merit of different code changes, this is a first step.
* We were also going to make an NNS controlled canister to host the NNS Principles, which would be code running on the IC.
* We did define a specific an achievable process to implementation.
* DFINITY has voted to adopt other motion proposals in the past which specific were never intended to run code on the IC, such as the "Temperature Check" proposal. The purpose of that proposal was only to start a discussion, it specifically claimed no intent to change code. To approve a proposal like that, and reject this one is 100% hypocrisy.
* The NNS is designed to be a hybrid of both community and code. Therefore, defined parameters for the community aspect should be just as valid as defining parameters for the code aspect. Otherwise, I suggest DFINITY either remove the "motion" proposal type, abstain from voting on all motion proposals, or stop using the "this won't lead to code" excuse whenever it's convenient.
* If proposals for code changes are so important, then why hasn't DFINITY implemented any of the community proposals arguing for code changes that have passed? For example, why are we still waiting on the implementation of the followee reset proposal?

**Why DFINITY should have voted yes**
In DFINITY's own stated voting guidelines you list "About the IC and in the interest of the IC". 

This proposal was created to address serious concerns regarding the NNS, which were causing skilled building in the ecosystem to leave. Specifically, we design the "NNS Principles" proposal to ask neurons to tell the ecosystem that we can trust them not to abuse censorship or tokenomic powers. Neurons have no collective voice, and now you've removed even the chance for them to start forming one.

How is the NNS supposed to coordinate and accomplish anything meaningful or complex with absolutely no defined foundation, direction, or expectations?

**What DFINITY should do next:**
1. Pick one:
A. Remove the "motion" proposal type entirely.
B. Abstain from voting on all motion proposals.
C. Stop using the "this won't lead to code" excuse on motion proposals whenever it's convenient and you don't want to explain your actual motives.
2. Explain why you waited until AFTER voting to reject to bring up these objections, when you could have brought them up during the Governance Working Group meetings you hosted, where they were approved by the working group.
3. Explain your plan for addressing the problem statement of this proposal, or your opposing research showing this problem doesn't exist. You host the working group to do research to solve problems, so if you won't accept those solutions it's only fair that you produce your own plan to solve those problems.
4. Since you think Known Neurons need to list their principles, and DFINITY and ICA are the largest Known Neurons, then please follow your own advice and list these principles. Namely, tell us where DFINITY will draw the line for censorship and tokenomic changes when voting on NNS proposals. I think everyone would really like to know!

[/quote]
To be fair I directly raised my feedback & concerns in the working group and summarized these points directly after the meeting on Nov 10 in the [minutes](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-governance/15584/52) shared in the forum. 

In the minutes I wrote: *"With respect to turning Ethos into a proposal: In my opinion we should try to clarify beforehand what is in scope of being a NNS proposal. I am personally in favour of a narrow scope, where NNS proposals are about concrete changes to the NNS protocol (or at least motion-like intentions on introducing certain features). From that perspective, guiding principles would not be in scope of NNS voting."*

Of course, back then this was my personal feedback, which I shared in the forum with the community and also within DFINITY. However, I believe I was very transparent about my concerns and also the merits of the proposal. 

The final decision was then made by the trusted neurons within DFINITY this week. I provided input to this discussion (namely the minutes mentioned above), but I am not a trusted neuron myself.

I can follow your description of the problem statement and also the narrative of your proposal. And I can also follow the logic that, if one takes a broader view on what should be in scope of an NNS proposal, one could be in favour of this proposal. 

On the other hand, I would like to kindly ask you accept the line of argument above, which is based on a more narrow interpretation of the scope of NNS voting (even if you do not agree with it). There are no further reasons apart from what is described above.

The governance topic is a glorified poll, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it were used as such: a place to do temperature checks with liquid democracy, preventing bots and platform bias influence.

Unfortunately Dfinity seems to ignore or forget this when it suits their agenda.
They shot down proposals cause they "don't lead to code changes" but voted yes to other motions with: 
- No code changes.
- Code changes they haven't worked on.
- Code changes they latter refused to implement cause they have issues with proposed implementation despite having voted in favour, i.e periodic confirmation.

wpb | 2022-12-14 00:17:44 UTC | #7

@aiv your frustration is understandable.  I've been there.  Many of us have been there.  You did put in a lot of time to this proposal and you did an excellent job leading it.  However, I am personally glad that DFINITY voted the way they voted on this proposal.   I think principles make sense for individual neurons, but not the NNS as a whole.  In a similar way to what @bjoernek described, I think you received feedback of opposition during the deliberation on this topic, but mistakenly interpreted your clarification to the points people made as convincing them to agree with your position.  I still don't care to argue about this topic, but you seem to be pushing your own agenda really hard.  Perhaps it would be more productive to take a step back long enough to let emotions settle.

nlh | 2022-12-14 02:26:29 UTC | #9

I have my voting right. When I cast my vote, I will always vote based on my own interest and principles. I don't need some folks defining NNS principles for me regardless how well defined they are.
We have a village of, let's say 100 folks. And somehow 95 of them manage to talk about issues such as governance, tokenomics, etc. all day long while only 5 working on products. Mixing politics and technology in the early stage of development has proven to be a disaster.

Arthur | 2022-12-14 05:02:30 UTC | #10

This feels very strange and exceptional to have the Foundation use it's tremendous power in governance to veto an effort to enable the community to define the future of the IC while making no effort to respond to the problem described in the proposal itself. I would like to hear a counter-solution to the stated problem:

**Internet Computer Investors & Developers feel insecure with the ability of the NNS to change token economics & platform operation. NNS Proposal creators lack guidance on the attitudes of NNS participants which could inform proposal creation. No statement exists on the attitudes or intentions of NNS participants as a body.**

Arthur,

I'm more and more convinced that the only path here is development of external expertise on the replica, decentralization of voting power and moving to rough consensus and running code.  Motion proposal still hold the mystique of agency, but are, as previously mentioned, glorified polls.

Just my two cents....and again...a lightly held opinion.

The reason for lots of deleted messages here is I'm reeling in shock at having a post removed or deleted for the first time ever and also coming to terms with the fact that this thread is nonsense and Dom personally had our proposal killed. 

I have a long and insane legal letter sent to me by his lawyers but obviously penned by him.

I want to start by saying that I respect Dfinity’s vote and its right to vote however it sees fit. But this argument is weak and to be frank the hypocrisy is deafeaning. 

Dfinity has voted YES to a lot of proposals that had absolutely no “path from proposal to code running on the IC”. While this proposal has quite a few paths that lead to code changes. We can explore them further if you want but I doubt it would be a fruitful endeavour since I honestly don’t believe this is the actual reason for the vote. No disrespect but it makes no sense to me personally. 

I don’t have any special interest in this proposal passing or not. However, it would be reassuring for us to agree on certain principles especially regarding censorship and tokeneconomics changes, so I tend to favor a YES vote…but I decided to not get involved and let my followee vote for me. 

But I have to wonder what criterion for governance decision making is this, if you pick and choose when to use it? What is the difference between this proposal, that Dfinity rejected, and other proposals with no enforceable path forward, that Dfinity accepted?

If @Arthur claim is true I think it’s a clear 🚩regarding motion proposals. You can’t use them to change code; but, you can use them to spread propaganda and/or influence the community. If Dom recognizes this maybe we should consider removing this topic from the NNS.

-------------------------

ildefons | 2022-12-14 12:01:54 UTC | #21

In my opinoion DFINITY's vote makes sense. We should not experiment with the NNS governance structure without having a systematic way to confidently assess the consequences of a governance proposal like this one. I agree with the existence of principles but we should first experiment with different ideas on less significant environments like SNS1. Let's try to propose principles to govern SNS1, let's try to develop tools to asses the consequences of governance proposals on SNS1. Then, when we feel confident about ourselfs and our tools, then we can transfer this knowledge to NNS.

**Treasury proposal**: no enforceable code.

**Dfinity vote**: YES

**Ethos proposal**: no enforceable code. 
**Possible path to code**: change voting parameters for censorship & tokeneconomics. 
**Dfinity vote**: NO

What’s the difference @bjoernek?

LightningLad91 | 2022-12-14 12:20:00 UTC | #24

I've read this forum post several times now. Can you highlight the part that you think supports DFINITY's argument for voting to reject? Considering these principles were posted on May 10 I'm curious why they've been interpreted differently for this proposal and not the Treasury "temp check" proposal that DFINITY voted to adopt.

That's subjective, I know tons of investors and developers who've never mentioned that.  Why are you making this into an objective "problem" when it's just an opinion.

I think it's way too early for the NNS to be any more than a random collection of people each with differing opinions.  Decentralisation takes time and I for one don't want to have to adhere to a list of guidelines specified by a small group of individuals and a conversation I haven't been part of.

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-14 13:04:21 UTC | #26

How do you attract bigger companies to move to the IC if there are no guarantees of protocol stability? This lack of long-term stability seems inherent to the protocol, every aspect of it could be subject to change. This seems to fit in with the ethos of Web3 but not for any big corporate entity. How can ICP become a new basis layer of the Internet if it has certain seemingly unavoidable/unfixable issues that come with it?

Unless this total flexibility of the protocol is a feature, which it certainly is to a big extent. But I've always wondered if a corporation could have its own ICP enclave which would not be subject to the NNS.

bjoernek | 2022-12-14 14:37:58 UTC | #33

@LightningLad91 @mechaquan @AndraGeorgescu 
I can understand the comparison which you are drawing to the temperature check proposal. Indeed the decision on the temperature check proposal was not clear-cut and we had a discussion on whether this proposal would meet the criteria of our DFINITY voting guideline (as for example explained [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-s-vote-on-governance-proposal-80970-spam-proposal-and-86639-temperature-check/16156) by @diegop in an earlier post). 

I guess the reality is that applying principles in practise always gives room for interpretation, and one could come up with arguments for and against a proposal, even when using the same principles. 

And probably in hindsight, given the a big amount of controversy, which the voting by DFINITY on the temperature check proposal steered, it would have been better to vote no (while being open for further discussion at the same time).

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2022-12-14 14:44:33 UTC | #34

Thanks for this… I think the biggest issue here is around transparency and consistency.

This is what will make people want to invest money and time into the IC.

I fully agree that principles/criteria/goals are a useful tool. For example, some time ago @lara & me compiled a list of voting goals which we found useful to assess proposed voting enhancements. 

However, I have a different view on how & where these principles should be applied. When it comes to expressing how members of the NNS will most likely vote, it looks very natural for me to define & communicate principles on the level of known neurons and not for the NNS as a whole. This way we can create a competition of ideas, and neurons can follow those known neurons which reflect best their preferences.

infu | 2022-12-14 15:04:01 UTC | #36

@aiv The proposal is interfering heavily with the way things work right now. I would be surprised if it passed right away. You are free to change it and convince everyone it's the right thing to do, then propose it again as many times as you want.

From the proposal:
![image|690x292](upload://p4gE6Rc7X9y303BnUmGWxcwbcf6.png)

The way things work right now - Everyone votes with their tokens and if voters believe a proposal is for the better, they vote yes. Even if that 'yes' is to delete a canister, which in theory should decrease the ICP token value. Voters are well aware that messing with tokenomics and censorship reduces the value of their tokens and it should be done only in dire circumstances, where deleting something will be the lesser evil. This is a lot better than big tech, which has you agree to a ToS giving them the freedom to silently remove anything they want without legal repercussions.

From AWS Terms of Service
![image|690x116](upload://pNzMZ7ZaEvtkh6DQR3ev06zUzXp.png)
Notice "if we reasonably believe" basically means "do whatever we want", because they can always provide a reason to believe anything.

The mutability aspect is not very different from Ethereum, where you have mining pools and nodes vote on software upgrades, which can do anything. Being technically and logistically harder doesn't mean it's more immutable or more censorship resistant. Ethereum can decide to make things easier and faster, which will result in the same governance system as NNS.

The proposed "NNS Principles" sound very much like ICP Terms of Service and when Dfinity votes for these principles/terms, it will be pretty much digitally signing them and probably getting legally obligated.
So how will this play out? If there are dire circumstances and something has to be done, not only the ICP price will fall, but also NNS and voting neurons will be breaking their principles/terms causing it to fall even more, and additionally everyone voting may get exposed to legal actions against them.

You highlighted it's a problem that 'no one can speak on behalf of all NNS neurons' 
![image|690x66](upload://c7yOvWArEAZnJRWlfYV16mVOa5l.png)
I really don't think it's a good idea for someone to be speaking on behalf of a DAO. It should work just like it does, everyone speaks for themselves and the code speaks for itself too. I wouldn't want someone to be marketing the 'principles' to attract new devs and investors.

These principles at best will be a perfect translation of the ever-changing code, which will be near impossible to do. At worse, they will be disconnected from the code Terms of Service. As a developer, I can't see the benefit of increasing trust based on loose text principles, which are doomed to be broken and create a bigger mess as soon as someone tries to make Silk Road on the IC.

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-12-14 15:15:32 UTC | #37

I think you say all what need to be said about voting and this NNS principles proposal.

Having competing principles and interests is the nature of decentralization. As a result, these principles should be well defined within each known neuron, not NNS as a whole.

I don't want and will never accept a set of NNS principles that go against my own principles and interests.

And as mentioned above, these guidelines definitely leave room for interpretation (which is to certain extent is also desirable). Quite often, governance proposals come with good arguments in favour & against, and the final decision can be a close call.

Ok so this existed BEFORE the treasury proposal

Which was voted YES by Dfinity AFTER being clearly controversial 

And we are to feel everything is fair, above board and investments in ICP are safe 

Builders right now, after reading this forum post are to feel confident in NNS and how Dfinity conducts themselves 

This post should give Builders and Investors assurance that there is no room for big powers to drastically rug the floor underneath them? 


The whole point of all this was to stop whats happening right now - I'm hugely disappointed and don't have confidence in Dfinity as an Entity 

Hell I dont even see any efforts from dfinity to reassure everyone of measures taken to offer some certainty 



Next steps are tangible ones which I'm assuming will be shut down by Dfinity and their Synapse pals but It'll be a last ditch effort before I call it a day here

The actions are all I'm looking at, the words have been all too misleading for long enough

As of now I see Dfinity as a biased org - and will stay as such till actions show otherwise

Thanks for this… I think the biggest issue here is around transparency and consistency.
[/quote]

I think this is fair feedback and I agree we should strive for more consistency. This should be a natural part of DFINITY (and also other neurons) gaining experience over time with the deliberation & voting process (after all, we are interacting on quite new territory here). I am definitely supportive of that and will make an effort to contribute in that direction.

I agree with DFinity. The Yes and No buttons exist for people or entities to vote as they wish. We should not institute group thinking and peer pressure into how neurons vote. The principles are made to appear like harmless guidelines, but I am sure they will be waved in the face of DFinity at every turn. Let each neuron define their own principles, then we either trust them individually or not. DFinity is an independent contributor free to act as it wills.

All this was addressed and discussed during the first Twitter space, there's no point wasting even more time on this now that it's dead. You can watch the recording if you want.


However, I appreciate your well thought out arguments. At least you're making them and arguing valid concerns and points. You're furthering the discussion.

At least you thoughtfully voted to reject, I can respect that.

Silently nodding along for 2 months and then voting no and giving a weak excuse, that's disappointing.

In any case, I'm ready to move forward. Let's make sure we get all Known Neurons to list their principles on at least a few of the most important topics, like censorship and tokenomic changes. That'll at least be a start!

I totally agree and respect their right to vote as they wish. I just don’t believe the reasoning offered and would appreciate more honesty and transparency. And the reason why I don’t believe it is because there are multiple paths to code changes and I even offered an example. But to each their own I guess. 

I have no issue with the vote itself but the decision-making process they claim to have doesn’t seem to be what is being practiced in reality and that makes me uneasy. I would rather just be offered no reasoning at all at this point. 

Also when Dfinity votes, the voting is basically over and they determine the end result. So we do pay a lot more attention and they are scrutinised more thoroughly than a less influential neuron. That is normal and healthy for the governance process because one entity sways a lot of influence over a network that we are all invested in and building on.

[/quote]
Agreed. Perhaps someone could submit another proposal to require known neurons to continually disclose their principles in a public and easily accessible location, and that those principles must cover certain topics (and specific subtopics). Then it should be easy for the IC dashboard to link from known neuron IDs to that public disclosure location, just like it does now to the known neuron's name change proposal. Although a name change proposal often includes such principles, these principles are not in any required topical format. Nor are they updatable or easily accessed across all known neurons. 

Another idea would be to create a simple summary of all known neuron positions on the required principle topics (e.g., 80% of voting power from known neurons supports principle X, 20% supports principle Y, etc.). This should be relatively easy given the small number of known neurons, especially if they are all publishing their principles in an easy to access location and all cover (at a minimum) certain required topics.

I think most IC community members (including myself) would strongly support the principles that you proposed to guide their personal choices. So if we can find a way to collate and summarize the views of known neurons in a single location, then that could effectively accomplish the same objective, don't you think? In fact, doing it this way instead could be perceived as much more authentic, voluntary and less perfunctory than a general set of principles that a slim majority of members might have approved a few years ago. 

Keep in mind, some known neurons may just have the principle of purely selfish maximization of personal profit, community be damned. That personal position should be perfectly fine if they are not breaking any laws. However, I would much rather know that those known neurons exist out in the open rather than having them buried in the 49% that did not vote for the original lofty principles a few years ago.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-14 17:52:10 UTC | #59

I much prefer Known Neurons having a principle they follow then the whole of NNS. One central 'constitution' would be way too sluggish, while several smaller and competing 'constitutions' allow for a dynamic play-field of ideas.

And probably in hindsight, given the a big amount of controversy, which the voting by DFINITY on the temperature check proposal steered, it would have been better to vote no (while being open for further discussion at the same time).
[/quote]

I want to highlight this point from @bjoernek which may have been buried among the comments.

It would be fair to say that we learned from the "NNS temperature" vote so now we have a higher bar for "code to path." In retrospectives, many of us think we should have had a higher bar for that vote. 

We have raised the bar after that. So this is an iteration and learning. Similarly one of the lessons we learned from that is to publish our thinking openly BEFORE voting (not days later). 

To call it this NO vote a "contradiction" because of the precedents of previous DFINITY votes i think is *reasonable, but missing-the-point* since it ignores that DFINITY is learning as an organization about how to analyze proposals and how it votes (I am sure other neurons similarly learn as patterns emerge).

[/quote]

No doubt. I just think DFINITY is painting themselves into a corner much like they did when they said that they view adopted community proposals as clear directive to work on a task.

I suspect that future motion proposals will be contentious due to subjective views about whether there's a clear path to code changes. I would appreciate if you or @bjoernek can explain what the minimum criteria is. For example:

- Do we need to provide actual code examples?
- Do we need to provide a preliminary architecture?
- Do we just need to state "This proposal could lead to code changes"

Several people have made arguments that this proposal could have led to code changes driven by follow-on proposals. Does DFINITY not agree?

I have zero issue with DFINITY voting to reject this proposal. I'm just confused by the reasoning and what that means for future proposals.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2022-12-14 19:00:25 UTC | #66

I totally agree with you. Instead, we should have really good community engagement in the process of developing changes to the IC. Motion proposals seem to provide an excuse for not doing market validation.

Why would you have to provide updates at all, let alone "all the time"? Are your core principles really that fickle?

As for your other issue about "no path to code", I personally don't think that is the real issue here for DFINITY. However, even if that excuse were true, code could certainly be written to strip names and/or followers from neurons that have not disclosed their core principles to the minimum required extent. So a "path to code" does exist even if it is never formally implemented.

You said that named neurons would need to “continuously disclose their principles”. That’s why I said “all the time”, because continuously means approximately the same thing.

Very good questions @LightningLad91.

I think at this point in the dialogue it will be helpful to reveal a bit more about my own thinking before I explain more of DFINITY's.

## 1. My own thinking

***I was originally in favor of voting YES on proposal #96475 before and I subsequently changed my mind after internalizing @bjoernek 's argument.*** So I had a lot of the same questions you have and I also had time to interrogate my own thinking and @bjoernek 's argument. Ultimately, I was swayed by the argument. This of course is not unique (specially in this case where Bjoern was the closer domain expert since he had put more time to think on it). I have both swayed and been swayed many times at DFINITY. ICP is very important to us so folks analyze things.

As a DAO, it is important to me that folks have healthy dialogues to explain their positions and folks feel free to make their own mind.

## 2. To answer your specific questions...

I do not have a grand strategy for explanation, so it is best to just lay out each question and answer it as honestly as I can.

[quote="LightningLad91, post:65, topic:17398"]
* Do we need to provide actual code examples?
* Do we need to provide a preliminary architecture?
* Do we just need to state “This proposal could lead to code changes”
[/quote]

No, this is an understandable interpretation of what DFINITY's "code to path" is, but not what we intend. The tenet is more akin to:

* A proposal for websockets support (with no architecture or code samples) is a feature and would pass the "path to code" test because it is feasible (which is the other DFINITY tenet, "faster than light consensus" is not). Now, DFINITY may agree or disagree with the feature itself, but it would pass the "path to code".

* A proposal to change a tokenomics parameter would similarly have a "path to code" (regardless if the proposal was all tokenomic analysis), independent of what DFINITY thought.

Inversely....

* Proposal #96475 was a proposal to make future proposals about how to think about future feature proposals. I am not trying to paint a caricature, more laying out how many degrees it was from a concrete feature. To be perfectly honest, this was a bit too meta for the tenet. If you squint you can argue it falls within the "path to code" tenet (that was my original position), but it was a stretch so I changed my mind as well. *Now, i have probably submitted proposals that would not pass this tenet in today, so I am in no way criticizing folks, just saying DFINITY's bar changed.*

However... NNS is permissionless, if someone wants to propose a feature X and then explain with their own principles, they totally should! 

This is why DFINITY's position is much simpler than people may interpret: it has a list of filters that make it a default NO. 

To quote @Manu who once described it very well:

[quote="Manu, post:11, topic:16432"]
I’d rather see the ICP ecosystem move to a policy where you vote yes if you’re very convinced that the proposal is good, and vote no otherwise (irrespective of whether that meant you think it’s a bad idea or you just didnt understand all the details, or you think it’s too early etc).
[/quote]

This is why a NO is more of a cultural default to DFINITY, unless it believes a YES is very important.

This is an example of "raising the bar" on the tenets.

Ironically (and I really do mean ironically), this organizational conservative temperament of only voting YES when absolutely convinced/necessary is part of the initial intent behind these proposals in the first place. DFINITY cannot control other entities so it is  fair to say it is just consistently raising the bar on its YES votes... and also trying to communicate the intent of the NO votes. Sometimes a NO vote may be because it did not understand it, it was too far from a path to code, its infeasible, etc... 

This is one reason @bjoernek added:

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:17398"]
### We want to be clear in what this means and does not mean

While we vote NO on the proposal, we think it is a reasonable proposal created in good faith. We also very much appreciate the careful syndication of this proposal, which included concise write-ups, forum deliberation, and presentations in the governance working group & in Twitter spaces.
[/quote]

We DO think it was a good faith effort. It just did not pass our internal bar.

As someone who changed his mind on this, I can appreciate some doubts so I can share my own journey thinking about this.

## 3. Relation to past proposals

I do not think early proposals had a baked philosophy or tenets. Patterns are still emerging as we learn. I wrote the rationale of a lot of proposals last year so I can say that some thinking has changed, but mostly it has been revealed by each proposal, each vote, each community conversation. Every proposal helps us understand more and more about we care about and do not care about, so still lots of room for case-by-case analysis + iteration.

## 4. Conclusions

We envision a world where many entities have different goals and principles in running this DAO. 

*This is one reason, I think it is most helpful to explain DFINITY's position and vote... instead of trying to convince folks to change their own.*

I am sorry for not having the energy to participate in one of the hundreds of decision-making threads in IC. Nothing personal, I am not participating in a lot of them and by the looks of it, nobody is. What I can afford to do is spend some time reading the most popular forum threads and proposals and give feedback everyone is free to ignore. Additionally, I didn't ask for a proposal that results in a signed document potentially admissible in court and thus I didn't participate in the proposal preparation. You can agree, nobody loses their vote or ability to post in the forum, because they didn't show up in prior meetings. 

I am sure you mean well. However, I got the feeling this thing is way more complicated than it sounds to be. If we use the NNS to produce documents, then I doubt developers, entrepreneurs & investors are the ones who should be voting. More like a DAO full of lawyers is required.

Fwiw, and no disrespect to my Haskell friends who love abstraction :wink: ... once someone pointed out to me the many degrees of abstractions the proposal had, I did start to see it differently.

Now I chose "haskell" deliberately since its obviously a programming language. You can have very very abstract code. So one's comfort level with how abstract a proposal is definitely a subjective one. I do not fault folks for wanting more concreteness nor do I fault folks for having more taste for abstraction.

But yeah this paragraph kind of explains how even i (who have submitted some very abstract proposals which DFINITY may vote NO in today's world) came around to thinking...

I don’t really agree with this statement; but, I do understand the point you are making.

I would argue that motion proposals (global context) are meant to be used as a tool for organizing groups of people around an idea and often start at a high level of abstraction in order to move everyone towards more concrete action.

In my experience when a minority of members propose a very opinionated proposal it tends to create waves and fracture trust within a group.

Motion proposals are a very sensitive topic for me. I have to admit I’m not a fan simply because there is so much opportunity for abuse by power players. I do wonder when we may just call it quits on this part of the experiment and move towards only allowing technical proposals to be put forth.

I don’t disagree. I think this is a reasonable and fair way to think about it. At the risk of coming off as “weak-minded” and one who changes their mind too often, it is certainly is a good point. I need to weigh that in as well and think about it some more as you are doing as well.

Truth is that this proposal definitely strained our “code to path” tenet internally because it was way too broad and abstract, but hey… maybe we are wrong and we iterate our own thinking (as I did in this particular proposal). Our current direction is towards “higher bar for YES”.

This is why these dialogues are important.

I think they have value, but we could change the name to polls and drop the voting reward to weight 0 so they don't affect reward. Participation would be voluntary and likely more reflective of the community paying attention. Maybe don't allow following on the topic....or publish both the active votes vs passive votes...that would be interesting.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-15 01:30:56 UTC | #79

ICDevs is voting reject mostly because we are following dfinity. This only has a tangential effect on devs(obviously subjective and there are certainly arguments to be made both ways), but when surveyed for opinions, the dev board was not very committal and I don't think there was much momentum toward favoring it. 

We love the work that @aiv put in and we think we should still do the work to come up with the principals and a type of "score card" that named neurons can publish stances on.  We'll be happy to participate.

Generally we're interested in a spirit of subtraction where the NNS does less and less as we get to know the network better and better. There are obvious network functions necessary to be governed via the NNS and those have that execute real code and do real things. They are deterministic much like the code we write for the IC.  That really should be our focus here. Help the community understand and become experts in those mechanisms so we have more than one hand on the steering wheel.

Just the other day, I insisted there was no censorship of alternative viewpoints on this forum and today I see a post from @Arthur flagged! This is shocking, he's a stalwart member of the community, and his revelation about legal threats was important. If it's untrue any such threats were made, the Foundation could respond by saying so, but simply flagging is clear censorship.
Second, Dfinity's primary explanation for its 'no' vote is deeply unconvincing. The secondary argument is better than the primary one, though not strong enough in itself to justify a 'no' vote. Maybe, Dfinity should have abstained on this one. And I say this as someone who does not support the Ethos idea, for reasons explained in the original Ethos thread.

Update: on further consideration, I take back the word 'censorship'. Since most community members can flag posts, and we do not know who did in this case, it is wrong to blame mods or Dfinity. I am leaving the comment up because of the other content in it, which remains valid for me.

jorgenbuilder | 2022-12-15 18:17:10 UTC | #84

Are folks in this thread calling a flagged post censorship, or was a post actually scrubbed by some forum admin?

1) A flagged post isn’t censorship, I’m pretty sure we all opened that post and read it anyway.

2) Anyone who’s signed in can flag a post that they find offensive, and it seems within reason that someone would flag as offensive a post referencing Old Yellar in relation to another human being, without some alterior motive.

Just trying to understand the depth of this censorship claim. It isn’t well evidenced in the body of this thread.

@jorgenbuilder So this is how flagging works on discourse. https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/

So L1, L2, and L3 can all flag posts (each level can flag more posts per day), and L3 flags can instantly hide the posts of L0s.

This is what happens when you flag a post.

Again I see the typical extreme attacks being made in relation to token price and those who just invested for financial gain, with misinformation, expletive remarks that they feel give stronger meaning to their case.

We have seen those who have a good understanding of the economics of the token give valid reasoning and come to the conclusion that the inflation and price are relatively right and not much improvement can be accomplished. 

The suggestion that the inflation of the token should be manipulated for financial gain is nothing more than panic or greed and a lack of understanding of this project and the possibilities for the future.

I support DFINITY decision not to vote on supporting extreme views in my opinion was the right decision to make.

I see the need for an Ethos but with different warring groups it is too early to make a declaration of behavior within the NNS at this time as the war has just started and cannot be determined till after the war.

I feel that those who are investing in neurons just for rewards and being locked in should be able to remove themself from this project and I support a Marketplace to put up their neurons for sale for those of us that want to invest further.

Allowing those who have inappropriate comments to make should be allowed to vent their opinion as in the long run, are seen for what they are and will lose support on their own but at the same time give a full view of what to or not to do.

this thread is nonsense and Dom personally had our proposal killed

I totally understand the emotional response, but this point does not seem true.  If you remove all public known neurons from the vote tally, the result is 1.4% Yes and 12.8% No.  If you add your Arthur's neuron (5.6%TVP) and Synapse (5.1%TVP), the vote tally is still only 12.1% Yes and 12.8% No, not including DFINITY, ICA, or ICDevs.  I just don't see any way that you can slice the data and make a valid argument that Dom killed this proposal.

I’m more and more convinced that the only path here is development of external expertise on the replica, decentralization of voting power and moving to rough consensus and running code. Motion proposal still hold the mystique of agency, but are, as previously mentioned, glorified polls.
[/quote]
I think a lot of people agree with this point (including DFINITY), but there has yet to be a viable path identified that moves other people and organizations in this direction.  There is no incentive.  I'm still listening for ideas, but nothing has surfaced.

People have been going nuts experimenting with Tokenomics… and the whole reason for this “Ethos” is to stop these cowboy moves with potential drastic consequences
[/quote]
Perhaps this attitude is why the proposal failed...you want to control people's beliefs about what is in the best interest in the IC.  It's hard enough to coordinate a proposal that seeks alignment of principles of a lot of people, but near impossible in an ecosystem that values decentralization and independent thinking when advocates for the proposal are vocalizing a willful intent to control other people.

I think it’s way too early for the NNS to be any more than a random collection of people each with differing opinions. Decentralization takes time and I for one don’t want to have to adhere to a list of guidelines specified by a small group of individuals and a conversation I haven’t been part of.
[/quote]
This comment resonates with me.  I don't want to be expected to adhere to anyone else's guidelines.  I will vote with my own convictions and expect people around me to vote with their own convictions.  I believe this is necessary to achieve decentralization and it will be a slow journey to get where everyone thinks governance is fully decentralized.  The best place to define principles is at the neuron level, not the NNS level.

We should not institute group thinking and peer pressure into how neurons vote. The principles are made to appear like harmless guidelines, but I am sure they will be waved in the face of DFinity at every turn.
[/quote]
I think there is a lot of truth in this statement and is likely a major reason why it did not pass.  To be honest, you could replace DFINITY with any named neuron and the logic would still apply.

if we can find a way to collate and summarize the views of known neurons in a single location

I hope to accomplish this with crowdgov.org after we finish the MVP.  It will be on a volunteer basis and something that can be edited by the admin for each respective registered neuron.  I think the community should come together to scope the feature.

To be clear, I deleted the comment. I don't think the flag is censorship, although that was my initial interpretation. I'll put a considered post up in another thread explaining the situation.

Cedric convinced me not to publish the legal letter as at the end of the day, we need cohesion and negativity gets us nowhere. Especially in the winter. These are discussions to have in fairer weather when morale is stronger. This is not the best application of time and mental resources at the current time.

These discussions needs to be had asap if there actually is an underlying issue, sweeping it under the rug might be more counterproductive.

I understand the sentiment. However, what is more important is building out the ecosystem and promoting the IC. This must occur through positive messaging only. Maintaining positivity is an immediate existential necessity and there is a ton to be positive about. tECDSA, Bitcoin integration, and the wealth of amazing apps emerging on the IC are where our focus must be. Solving issues of NNS centralisation is a medium-term issue. Early-stage centralisation is always an issue in blockchain platforms and one that tends to resolve itself over time.

Good to know thank you

Zane | 2022-12-16 01:06:00 UTC | #96

Respectfully I disagree, all of the IC cool features are pointless if the network isn't decentralized, as a dev knowing I might be building on quicksand constantly has me reconsidering whether I'm spending time doing the right thing.

And while yes all chains start more centralized most of them, all the major ones included, have something the IC doesn't: hardforks. 

Main components of the IC code are patented by Dfinity which in turn is run exclusively by one individual as recent findings have highlighted, that is on its own a big red flag, knowing on top of it this individual upon we all have to trust in, which by itself is absurd in the crypto space, also likes to threaten legal actions simply cannot be ignored.

At this point I'd have rather not known about the letter in the first place, cause now I know there might be a serious underlying issue with the Foundation, but without the specifics and the context behind it, it could all be discarded as an exaggeration.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2022-12-16 01:06:58 UTC | #97

Yes, but we can work with what we have. A fork is possible but it is premature to execute such a significant maneuver. The only meaningful layer 1 in my opinion is DFINITY. We can at the very least treat this as a pre-launch platform. 

I would also say that most other blockchains are vastly more centralised than DFINITY. The reason we feel it so much here is the transparency of the platform - which is yet another reason it should be considered a relatively safe place to develop.

It isn't without changing pretty much all the code which makes ICP stand out: consensus, chain key tech and other important stuff is under stricter license which doesn't make it possible to use that code if it doesn't run on the IC, a.k.a the network Dfinity currently controls, if tomorrow a "the DAO hack" situation were to happen, we wouldn't have the same luxury as ETH.

Whether the IC is more or less decentralized than other chains, everyone has a different opinion.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2022-12-16 01:16:19 UTC | #99

I agree with your last point. 

You don't have to license technology. You just develop anonymously like happened in the old days. This is also a much healthier way to establish a platform like the IC.

This is greatly needed and I hope it can be reached directly from the NNS follow tab once you have it ready for prime time.

This is what always say. We will decentralize incrementally as we mature organically.

[/quote]

How would you suggest we go about conducting those polls? It makes sense that we have motion proposals so that devs know which direction to code in before doing all the work, this feature only seems to be the cause of a lot of controversy at the moment due to perceived inconsistencies with the DFINITY foundations voting criteria. 

I think as centralization decays, the glorified polls feature that motion proposals offer will be more beneficial for reaching consensus on a direction to code towards, and therefore, the feature should remain.

In the future, when the NNS is much more decentralized, i think the motion proposal feature is gonna prove to be a great tool for facilitating planning in a decentralized fashion.

AndraGeorgescu | 2022-12-16 15:19:42 UTC | #105

I also share your concerns and believe that decentralization is one if not the most pressing issues at the moment.

The motion proposals would become polls....you just change the name and it changes the psychology. Less people expect that the result of the poll will actually happen.  ie:

Would you accept or reject a replica that changes the ability to lock tokens from a max of 8 years to 9 years?
