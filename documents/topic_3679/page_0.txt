Hello, 

I've been experimenting with ffmpeg wasm compile, and am running into a file size limitation error when the input file is > 2GB.  Just wanted to check is this the case on the ICP as well? Or is there a way around this limitation for WASM compiled code?

thanks

Yes, you will hit similar limits on the Internet Computer. Currently, WebAssembly only supports 4GB of memory (it is a 32 bit architecture), and this limitations then of course applies to the Internet Computer as well.

There is a variant of WebAssembly in the works that introduces 64 bit addresses, and surely eventually the Internet Computer will support that too. But not in the near future.

This is fascinating. Did you ever get ffmpeg running as a canister? That would be huge if so.
