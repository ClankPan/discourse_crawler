ICVC is preparing to launch its SNS DAO and will put forward a SNS proposal to the NNS on 22/07/2024. This forum is an opportunity for the community to discuss the ICVC SNS and ask the founding team any questions.

**VISION:**

ICVC‚Äôs vision is to augment traditional venture capital models by leveraging decentralised contributors to access broader and deeper expertise, streamline due diligence and ultimately provide early stage venture capital to exceptional founders building products that will define the future of the internet.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Currently, companies and projects within the Internet Computer ecosystem can suffer from a lack of funding options past their nascent funding stage, such as a Funded campaign or angel investment, and rely on early SNS launches to fund their development.

**ICVC DAO:**

ICVC aims to bridge this funding gap for exceptional companies and founders and provide projects with the early stage funding required to build a mature working product and a strong community prior to their SNS launch. This ensures that promising projects can continue to grow and innovate without prematurely relying on community funds or early decentralisation.

By operating as one unit, ICVC can make meaningful investments into companies and projects, thereby gaining access to opportunities and terms not usually available to retail investors. The ICVC platform provides a medium to make clearly defined investment decisions as a community through a diligent investment process designed to help our token holders make informed investments decisions, facilitate community debate and truly engage with project founders.

**PROJECT SUMMARY:**

* ICVC is a community-governed venture capital fund dedicated to identifying and nurturing high-potential early-stage ventures within the ICP ecosystem.
* $ICVC will be the native token of the ICVC DAO. $ICVC token holders will decide the governance and investment decisions of ICVC through the ownership of $ICVC tokens and the voting rights they guarantee.
* The ICVC DAO will control the $ICP raised during its SNS decentralisation sale and use the treasury to invest in early stage ventures through a diligent step-by-step investment process.
* In return for its investment, ICVC will receive equity and a claim towards any future ICO, token launch or SNS of accepted ventures. ICVC will distribute exit returns to ICVC token holders through a process designed to bring traditional VC methods on-chain.
* 100% of the $ICVC token supply will go towards SNS decentralisation sale participants.
* ICVC is incorporated in the Marshall Islands as a DAO LLC which allows ICVC to obtain corporate personhood, enabling the signing of term sheets and the execution of enforceable contracts with companies seeking funding.

**TOKENOMICS OVERVIEW:**

**Proposed Token Distribution:**

Total Supply: 20,000,000 $ICVC tokens

Initial Distribution:

* 100%: Allocated to decentralisation sale.

**Decentralisation Sale Configuration:**

|ICVC token supply at Genesis|20,000,000 $ICVC|
| --- | --- |
|Minimum direct contribution target|1,000,000 $ICP|
|Maximum direct contribution target|2,000,000 $ICP|
|Minimum participation|1 $ICP|
|Maximum participation|1,000,000 $ICP|
|Minimum number of participants|10|
|Community fund contribution (as of 23/06/2024)|92,593 $ICP|

**Initial SNS Parameters:**

|Transaction fee|0.0001 $ICVC|
| --- | --- |
|Rejected governance proposal cost|10 $ICVC|
|Rejected investment proposal cost|10 $ICVC|
|Minimum neuron stake|1 $ICVC|
|Maximum voting period for a proposal|4 days|
|Proportion of voting power needed for a proposal to be accepted|3%|
|Minimum dissolve delay for eligible neuron|0.5 years|
|Maximum neuron dissolve delay|2 years|
|Maximum dissolve delay bonus|2x|
|Maximum age for age bonus|1 year|
|Maximum age bonus|1.25x|

So 100% goes to the sale, where is allocation for liquidity?

-------------------------

Isaac_ICVC | 2024-07-12 14:50:41 UTC | #3

ICVC is committed to ensuring a high-level of liquidity for its token. To ensure this, negotiations were carried out with committed LPs prior to the announcement.

Committed LPs will loan up to 100k worth of ICVC tokens following the SNS swap. This will provide adequate liquidity on DEXs to support trading. 

No ICVC tokens will be used from other participants in the SNS swap.

Congratulations on the launch @Isaac_ICVC! I know you and your team have been working on this concept for a while, great to see such a comprehensive output for your efforts.

Best of luck, excited to see how this works!

Kick1776 | 2024-07-13 01:31:24 UTC | #6

So...does this mean Plug is going to get even less attention now? We really need a functional wallet in this space that isn't buggy and asks for access to your clipboard data.

-------------------------

MrBennyP | 2024-07-13 04:05:37 UTC | #7

Congratulations @Isaac_ICVC snd the ICVC team. I‚Äôm excited to see the concept turn into something with substance.

Maybe TalentDB and ICVC can build a partnership.

Check the top of the whitepaper for personnel.

The ICVC whitepaper is well worth reading all the way down actually, appears to be a well considered mapping of the SNS model of governance and treasury management onto a standard GP+LP venture capital model.

-------------------------

Isaac_ICVC | 2024-07-13 10:41:11 UTC | #10

We will put forward a proposal to the ICVC DAO to provide the ICP required for liquidity provisioning from the treasury following the SNS Swap. The exact amount depends on the total amount raised in the decentralisation sale.

Thanks for announcing this project. Could I ask for some elaboration regarding the problem statement?

The heart of the problem (as it's described) seems to be that up and coming projects are often forced to...

[quote="Isaac_ICVC, post:1, topic:33108"]
...rely on early SNS launches to fund their development
[/quote]

Can you explain more about why this is problematic?

Can I also ask if you're aware that multiple rounds of SNS sales for a single project will soon be possible (it's how WaterNeuron will be proceeding - assuming the existing DAO formed from the first SNS sale decides to proceed in that way).

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-07-14 23:22:16 UTC | #14

Not directed at ICVC but I wish projects would use SNS for decentralizing finished projects. Right now it seems to be a knockoff of gofundme and team dont seem to be held to actually providing a working project...

Are you able to provide some examples?

Is there an alternative funding approach that you think would work better (and why)?

-------------------------

dskloet | 2024-07-16 06:55:58 UTC | #17

Unfortunately these parameters won‚Äôt currently work.
See https://forum.dfinity.org/t/swaps-to-allow-at-most-100k-sns-neurons-for-direct-participants/33254
With such a high maximum funding amount the minimum participation will have to be much higher unless you can postpone the swap.

-------------------------

Isaac_ICVC | 2024-07-16 13:37:53 UTC | #18

Hey @dskloet thanks for flagging this update. We will review and post our proposed solution as soon as possible.

[/quote]

Would you also be able to elaborate on the problem statement when you get a chance (in the context of multi-SNS sales per project being an upcoming NNS feature). This makes me uncertain of what problem this project is solving (given that further funding can be raised through subsequent SNS sales).

Thanks üôè

LukeDugdale | 2024-07-16 20:37:52 UTC | #20

Hi Lorimer, 

Many founders in the ICP space actually find it quite hard to get to a stage where they can launch their SNS. There is a ton of work to do: legal, community engagement and ofcourse a need to learn and engage with the ICP tech stack, which to new developers can be confusing and hard to navigate. 

We've seen many projects fall short of SNS launch because they haven't felt like there is support for early funding and guidance in their embryo stage. 

We want to help founders with funding and development, so that there can be more SNS launches and high quality ones. ICVC will serve as a space for projects to share their ideas with the wider community, who can help shape how the project turns out by providing feedback and guidance.

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-07-16 22:01:31 UTC | #21

I feel projects should have some form of working product before doing a decentralization sale. If it is being used as a fundraiser on promises of a product, there is nothing holding those teams to their whitepaper after they have the funds. Previous SNS typically have most neurons following the dev neuron which can lead to auto-approving votes due to aggregate VP. Midnight treasury transfers passing in 2 minutes have already happened.

Not to fud any projects but icx has done the above. They've since made progress to show that the treasury is still in place and being used for project.
Estate Dao is a great example of having no working product. They've had very poor communication with token holders after launch. They purposely turn off comments on 90% of all twitter posts and don't answer on any of their social channels. 
Icpcoins is an example of a project that seems to be dead 90% of the time. Token prices have been wrong for days at a time. Wrong canister addresses for tokens. Dev teams seems to not be active, hence the current motion proposal looking the token holders about transferring the treasury. 

There are several options for strictly fund raising. Funded, NFT launches, 8yeargang.com, ICO's / presales like Taco Dao did and now it seems the upcoming ICVC.

Many people participate in SNS under the impression that projects will be controlled by Daos and that their votes actually carry weight. It seems the autonomous part of Decentralized Autonomous Organization ends up not being true for many projects. 

This may be why so many people view SNS as a scam / grift. Projects raise 200k ICP, vote to pay themselves 15k ICP for development and in return, provide a webpage that doesn't get updated.

-------------------------

Isaac_ICVC | 2024-07-17 13:30:36 UTC | #22

****UPDATE**

Thank you very much to the community for the warm reception of ICVC and for the interesting questions on the forum. We encourage more of these questions and remain fully available to answer and engage in community discussions. On that note, we'll be posting a lot of information on our Twitter, so make sure to follow us there (@icvcofficial). 

We thank DFinity for flagging the max neuron constraint and upcoming update to the NNS. As a result of this information we are working on updating our tokenomics parameters and will need to postpone the SNS proposal past Monday, July 22nd. We will post our updated parameters, as well as an updated timeline for our SNS shortly.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

domwoe | 2024-07-19 07:09:39 UTC | #23

@Isaac_ICVC Please add a link to the `sns_init.yaml` and the code as soon as possible to give everyone enough time to review before the actual proposal.

[/quote]

But the funds would be sitting in the treasury, controlled by the DAO (the people who invested). For example, they could review and approve subsequent proposals to unlock funds from the treasury to the development team, couldn't they? (just because SNSs haven't operated exactly this way in the past doesn't mean they couldn't)

How is this sort of problem addressed by ICVC? Isn't there even more danger in this case, precisely because decentralisation hasn't occurred before handing funds over? Do you have a take on this @LukeDugdale or @Isaac_ICVC?

Early stage startup funding is also inherently risky with a higher potential for failure. Add that to the risks of devs running off with the money (because it's easier than delivering a project) and it seems like ICVC is undoing some of the intentional aspects of SNS sales. How would ICVC realistically protect against this?

This all comes down to the configured parameters of the SNS swap. I think the examples provided indicate token holders making bad choices to invest in the wrong projects (at least in relation to their expectations).

-------------------------

Kick1776 | 2024-07-18 17:39:00 UTC | #25

I think one of the other unfortunate things is Daos like Openchat integrate and rely on other Dapps to pull info like token prices. If they Dao that they rely on chooses to stop running or just does not keep up with their product, now OC is forced to recode their integration with someone else ... Looking at you icpcoins.

***UPDATE**

Following the max neuron constraint and update to the NNS flagged by DFinity, we have updated our tokenomics to remain under the 100,000 SNS neuron limit.

ICVC will put forward a SNS proposal to the NNS on 29/07/2024.

We will release our open sourced code early next week. Please find our SNS init yaml and updated tokenomics below:

Why are you intentionally limiting the amount of time that the community has to perform proper due dilligence on your codebase? Why not simply open source it now? Your original plan was to launch in two days' time wasn't it?

-------------------------

hodlmes | 2024-07-21 06:29:17 UTC | #28

Based on the whitepaper, half (1M $ICP) is already committed by unknown LPs who will essentially have the majority and make all the decisions, even if the full amount is raised. Who are they? DFINITY? Is it even ‚Äúthey,‚Äù or is it just one person? @dominicwilliams is this you? Case closed.

P.S. On a serious note, why is 1k $ICP the minimum now? This is harsh.

What measures are in place to stop recipients of funds running off with the money and not delivering anything at all? If this just comes down to trust, I guess that's fine if it's explicit and understood by those who will be voting on this proposal.

A term sheet must be signed by the startup before receiving any funds. This term sheet aligns with standard practices in the venture capital space. While it does not guarantee that the startup won‚Äôt face failure, it does protect the venture fund (and its ‚Äòlimited partners‚Äô) from potential misuse of the invested funds.

The ICVC model is designed to closely align with traditional VC models. It's important to note that no investment model, including ICVC, is entirely risk-free. However, the ICVC model does not present more risk than traditional VC models.
Addressing concerns about ensuring developers are not raising funds with the intent to misuse them, the "Team" evaluation is a critical part of our due diligence process. This includes a comprehensive video interview to vet the team thoroughly and understand their true motivations.

Furthermore, the ICVC due diligence process is very extensive. Startups aiming to raise through ICVC, and subsequently pursue an SNS, will undergo a rigorous due diligence process. This process is significantly more thorough than the information required to submit an SNS, ensuring a higher level of scrutiny and evaluation.

I'd expect traditional VCs would reserve the right to take legal action if funds are abused. But I'm not sure how this would/could work with ICVC.

This is something I liked very much when skimming through the whitepaper. I'm interested to see how this turns out, and I applaud ICVC for giving this a go. I'll be following with interest.

Out of interest, are you able to point to any specific projects that the ICVC team think were/are ripe for this sort of funding? Perhaps some projects that didn't work out, or didn't get off the ground, or projects that are on your radar and you're hoping ICVC may be able to help?

-------------------------

Orlando | 2024-07-25 10:09:06 UTC | #35

The DAO will be represented by a corporate entity, ICVC LLC, incorporated in the Marshall Islands. More information can be found on the MIDAO website.


This corporate personhood allows ICVC to sign a term sheet with the venture raising funds, creating a legal liability between the startups and ICVC. Therefore, the DAO can take legal action against startups if they misuse the funds or attempt to rug pull the DAO.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-07-30 17:34:43 UTC | #36

Thanks @clement_icp / @Orlando, I'm not a legal expert, but I wouldn't expect it to be that simple in practice. It would be great if people more knowledgeable on this (other than those with vested interests in this project) could chime in on this conversation.

Legal proceedings would no doubt be a multi-stage process, surely requiring physical representation, backwards and forwards communication and mediation, fees, liabilities, the question of jurisdiction... Are you able to run through a couple of scenarios from start to finish identifying how this would actually work? Presumably you've already thought all of this through and have received the necessary legal advise. I think it's a very important component if ICVC is claiming to reserve the right/ability to take legal action (and actually execute on that).

 Apologies if I missed these details in the whitepaper (sometimes there are too many whitepapers and too little time). I appreciate ICVC answering my questions.

Isaac_ICVC | 2024-07-26 17:42:58 UTC | #37

****UPDATE**

**TECHNICAL UPDATE:**

We have updated our init file to align our time units across all inputs in order to resolve conversion and rounding issues due to month and year conversions being done differently by the NNS.This issue is detailed here for reference: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-yaml-month-and-year-conversion-to-seconds/32905

Furthermore, we have added a developer neuron in order to satisfy NNS conditions that at least one developer neuron be included in the SNS proposal. This developer neuron is configured as follows:

principal: mmutr-omtpf-yi6px-qu772-maqrn-hcr7h-lnwky-yrrqp-danlh-mi26q-bae
stake: 100 tokens
dissolve_delay: 6 months
vesting_period: 24 months
memo: 0

This developer neuron will be handled by the ICVC DAO development team and used to submit proposals and updates to the ICVC DAO SNS.

As a result of this technical requirement by the NNS, the ICVC DAO decentralisation swap will be for 19,999,900 $ICVC tokens of a total supply of 20,000,000 $ICVC tokens.

**WHITEPAPER UPDATE:**

The ICVC DAO confirmation text has been added to the init file. Swap participants will be required to confirm the ICVC DAO‚Äôs terms and conditions in order to participate in the ICVC DAO SNS Swap.

Furthermore, the [ICVC DAO Whitepaper](https://ic-vc.com/docs/whitepaper.pdf) and [Operating Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_eqIIxQbIec4f2GFpHQ59SLp5uO95muk/view?usp=sharing) have been updated to reflect community feedback.

-------------------------

Isaac_ICVC | 2024-07-29 15:35:38 UTC | #38

ICVC is ready and prepared to submit a proposal to the NNS to create the ICVC DAO SNS. However, a condition of the NNS is that there can only be one such proposal at a time considered by the NNS. This condition is detailed here for reference: [https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/launching/launch-steps-1proposal/#3-submit-nns-proposal-to-create-sns](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/launching/launch-steps-1proposal/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2gtvpPBGvYJ3Ek7LpgwSYy7wQAsWnquwOllYeEbHEIf7HcJBo-eaXb0Og_aem_6bJQ095xSideh_D-tQ_nUg#3-submit-nns-proposal-to-create-sns) 

We are therefore unable to submit the ICVC DAO SNS proposal to the NNS at this time. We will submit this proposal as soon as possible this week and remain available to answer any questions and engage in community discussions in the meantime.

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-08-01 12:38:46 UTC | #41

This seems like a great Idea. If this does go to a dao then will you disclose the LPs you talked to and the deal that was made for this to happen?

-------------------------

Mico | 2024-08-01 12:44:10 UTC | #42

For wtn to do that we will need to know if there will be a cap on canister controlled neurons. Otherwise by adding icp to the 8yr neuron we will reduce the maximum amount of nICP that will be minted. 

As well ICP does need a form of VC capital that is transparent to the community and open for everyone to join regardless of the financial situation they are in. This almost seems like a mutual fund that holds a "high risk" portfolio of startup tech companies. The major issue I see with this project is:

1) How will projects be vetted for funding?
2) Who will be conducting the research into the team, project, product market fit, market analysis?

3) Will all information be available to the dao to review prior to funding proposals to verify the review done by the team?

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-08-02 14:55:36 UTC | #43

Mico,

The [whitepaper](https://ic-vc.com/docs/whitepaper.pdf) answers all those questions on Section 3 (Investment Process) and details the role of Evaluators on 5.2.

In short:
1 - They have 15 sequential steps that will be voted by all neurons on the platform (internal voting).
2 - Evaluators will.
3 - Yes, there will be an "initial voting", that needs SNS vote to pass. If pass, a thorough due diligence and grading process is done, and everyone has access to the information (so they can grade).

Hope this summary helps, feel free to look into the whitepaper for deeper details.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-08-02 15:46:16 UTC | #44

Congrats ICVC team,

This does look as a very well thought out product, think it has all the arguments to succeed :+1: 

I only thought the **Evaluators and the grading system** (as an effective signal system) is not yet very ironed out, but after the sale you can revisit it deeper.

From the whitepaper, it does seem that anyone can become an evaluator (very low/easy requirements) and **grades will follow a popular contest** (as final grade is average of many evaluator grades).

Maybe I am being pessimist, but if an approved project is worth 500k$-2M$, it does give enough incentives for a team to setup a horde of evaluators, and vote strongly in favor of a certain project. Can you confirm if my theory might actually play out (assuming no course correction is done)?

Another concern I have is that Evaluators (that have little stake, like 100 ICVC) are not incentivized for grading low a project, as the only chance they have of gaining money is on profits of investments done. **A not approved project, always represents a 0% return on their time**. Imagine they work and refuse 10 projects, they are never paid for a value they actually added :thinking: 
Also they have a "low risk" context, which can be dangerous and outweigh the more conservative VCs.

As I always like a good challenge, here are **a few ideas that could improve** this component:
- evaluators should **always be held accountable** / have a reputation system. They can be rewarded based on how they voted, and how the company actually performs in metrics and in exit. It's common practice for startups to provide these growth metrics to VCs.
- Try to see the evaluators and grading system, as the "competitive advantage" of ICVC over other vc funds/syndicates, and it needs to learn and capitalize on the "blockchain / historic data" that **it accumulates over the years**, so that previous performance "signals" future performance. And again, evaluators and grade system are key for that.
- Try to see **evaluators as prediction market agents**, with a lot of qualified / competent evaluators working and competing for guessing the performance of the venture.
- You should have **higher requirements on the evaluators**, maybe they have a trial contribution phase (grades don't count for average), where after 3 investment processes, their work is publicly shown to Token holders and they need to be approved by DAO vote. And in inverse order, whenever an evaluator isn't contributing regularly or being bad at grading/prediction, they can lose their "role".
- To avoid someone giving 7 on all grades (basically farming), and even the human tendency to gravitate around a grade they feel comfortable about, you can add a bigger "weight" of the vote, if it goes away from historical average.
- Averages are only a part of the signal, please consider to give 1st and 3rd quartile (or a graph showing distribution of the votes), to see if evaluators were consensual (lower risk - enough information) or strongly disagreed (higher risk - not enough information). 

Hope some of these ideas help in the future. 

Highly looking forward to see this DAO blossom (as well as the ecosystem) :sun_with_face: :seedling:

I sincerely hope this is a legitimate project with a genuine team behind it.
SNS DAO having only 11 participants (who could potentially be the same person), it has already gained access to 110,346 ICP from the Neurons fund.

I'm more worried about the projects that ICVC will be investing in not being legitimate or following through with their promises (either intentionally or unintentionally). It'll certainly be interesting to see how this pans out.

Yes, 11 contributors (or less) have gotten access to 100K plus ICP. 

Both ICA and Dfinity voted positive to the SNS proposal. Assuming this was not decisions taken flipping a coin it would be interesting to know the justifications for these votes. 

I would have loved to join the SNS if the minimum participation amount was lower, with the information at hand 1000 ICP is to much of a risk to consider. 

After the SNS we peasants can still get involved for smaller sums if we can buy tokens on exchanges, right?
