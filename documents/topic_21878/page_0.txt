## Why a TypeScript Bootcamp? 🤔

For the past 2 years, [Demergent Labs](https://twitter.com/demergentlabs) has been working hard to make the Internet Computer more accessible to TypeScript developers by creating [Azle](), a TypeScript SDK for the Internet Computer.

This means, you can now **build Web3 with Typescript-only!**

That’s why at Code & State, we are hosting, from 21-27th of August, the first ever Typescript Bootcamp for the Internet Computer. 

## Tell me more 🤩
This Bootcamp is a virtual event where you will join other developers for one intense week of learning about the Internet Computer and Azle. The goal of the week is clear and simple: you will have to build a DAO, fully on the Internet Computer. 

To make sure you are fully equipped to survive the week and complete your project on time. We have prepared a set of resources:

* Daily guides 📜
* Educational resources (videos, tutorials, articles and repositories) 📚
* Lectures and workshops 🍿 
* Mentorship sessions 🧑‍🏫

A few sneak peeks of the subjects we will cover:
