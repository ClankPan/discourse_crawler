I am submitting this idea to the community as a solution to the recent spam issues, and as a strong foundation for a more robust governance proposal process moving forward.

## The Idea

I propose we create a multi-stage governance proposal process, initially starting with two stages (stage 0 and stage 1).

All governance proposals must start as stage 0 proposals.

Stage 0 proposals are "hidden" in the NNS UI, accessed explicitly by the user in a special location. Stage 0 proposals have a rejection cost of 1 ICP (debatable), a threshold to pass of 1% (debatable), a lifetime of 2 weeks (debatable) before which they cannot pass and after which they are automatically rejected, and do not affect voting rewards whatsoever (there is no ICP reward for the voter after adopting or rejecting the proposal).

If a stage 0 proposal passes (adopt votes greater than threshold and more adopt votes than reject votes), then a stage 1 proposal is created with the exact same information (title, body, etc). Stage 1 proposals behave identically to the current governance proposals.

This multi-stage process addresses the spam issue by 1) creating a special location hidden from the regular view of users for possibly low-quality proposals and 2) removing the ICP incentive for creating low-quality proposals. This holding area is low-stakes, thus we do not discourage proposal creation, but the bar for being promoted to stage 1 and thus the full high-stakes view of NNS users can be appropriately set.

This also lays a solid and configurable foundation for more stages in the future (stage 2, 3, 4, 5 etc), where at each stage we can have different UI behavior and criteria for progressing to the next stage.

## Technical Details

I propose we retire the [TOPIC_GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L71) topic and replace it with two new topics, `TOPIC_GOVERNANCE_STAGE_0` and `TOPIC_GOVERNANCE_STAGE_1`.

`TOPIC_GOVERNANCE_STAGE_1` would behave exactly as `TOPIC_GOVERNANCE` behaves now, no change in threshold, weighting, voting period, etc.

`TOPIC_GOVERNANCE_STAGE_0` would be a new topic that behaves as follows:
* Rejection cost of 1 ICP
* Threshold to pass of 1%
* Mandatory 2 week lifetime (the proposal cannot be be passed or rejected before the lifetime is up, automatically rejected at the end of the lifetime if threshold is not met)
* No effect on voting rewards

This sounds reasonable. I’m not sure I understand how the stage 0 proposal is supposed to be voted on though. Is it a private link that the proposer needs to advertise and use during their campaign; almost like a petition?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-04-29 19:27:36 UTC | #4

I don't know what the UI will look like, maybe the UI doesn't even have to change actually. You would just select to view all Stage 0 proposals.

## Who will watch the Phase 0 proposal

1. If only a small percentage of people go to the polls for phase 0, then the voting in phase 0 is inaccurate.
2. If most people will watch the stage 0 vote, then the purpose of the spam proposal has been achieved, and this proposal has no effect at all.

When you say 1% threshold to pass, what do you mean?  I’m assuming the exact number is negotiable, but I’m still trying to understand how you are defining threshold and pass.  These definitions would probably be important.

Also, what is the starting point of this proposal?  Does it start from having already removed the incentive to spam for the purpose of financial gain after implementation of a proposal like [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)?  Or are you wanting this to be implemented while there is still a financial incentive to spam?  If it’s the later, then I’m concerned there will still be financial incentive to spam AND to artificially vote yes on these stage 0 proposals just to move it to stage 1.

I can agree with this kind of approach for proposals that are submitted for the purpose of advertising and announcement, but I think it only works if you first remove incentives to spam for financial gain.

I don't think it matters, I am proposing this be implemented no matter the state of those proposals.

This proposal reduces the incentive to spam by making it much harder to get to stage 1 where voting rewards kick in. We can configure the threshold, rejection cost, and lifetime of stage 0 proposals to fight low-quality proposals that get through to stage 1.

I was looking through a few of the spammy proposals from the last week or so, and most had far less than 1% voting power adopting the proposals. I can go look and gather some actual empirical evidence, my guess is that a 1% adopt threshold would filter out most of the spam we have seen.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-29 20:15:20 UTC | #18

Ok that’s what I suspected.  A 1% threshold is actually pretty easy to hit these days.  In fact, I think a 10% threshold is pretty easy to hit today from neurons that are not accountable to anyone because they are not public.  I think this would still result in a lot of spam even if the threshold was closer to 10%.  I encourage you to think about how to separate the financial decision from the spam decision.  I don’t have a good answer yet except to remove the root cause of the voting imbalance, which is default following for All Topics.  I think/hope we are heading toward now since 55651 passed.  This kind of spam filter approach is fine after the financial incentive for spam is removed.

@wpb what do you think of this quote (I keep editing my comment)? Do you think > 1% of voting power would vote yes on stage 0 proposals, even though we haven't seen that kind of voting power adopting the spammy proposals we've seen so far (my assumption based on looking at a few of the spammy proposals)?

-------------------------

It's not just the 1% threshold required to get to stage 1. You also need a majority of voters to adopt the stage 0 proposal.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-29 20:27:32 UTC | #22

Here's a crazy idea I'll just throw out there, in case we need another way to disincentivize spam: if you adopt a stage 0 proposal, you stand to lose some ICP if the stage 1 proposal is rejected.

janman1970 | 2022-04-29 20:31:40 UTC | #25

I like this idea. Stage 0 still costs the proposer 1 ICP for rejection but nobody gains from voting in either direction at this point. Could Stage 0 be configured to require manual votes so a neuron with lots of followers can't steer the outcome?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-04-29 20:33:22 UTC | #26

I assume that could be done, but perhaps the threshold should be reduced if we did that.

Love most of the original proposal, not a fan of this spin off - we should use carrots not sticks to incentivize voting.

What happens to the minority in this case? I don’t think we should penalize voters for supporting minority opinions - this would just make centralized parties more powerful.

I think this comment is a very valid concern: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206/51

> I think right now people pretty unanimously vote no on spam proposals, because they’ll get the increased rewards anyway, and additionally the 10 ICP of the proposer will be burned if they reject. With your proposed change, the voters are now actually incentivized to vote yes on spam proposals, because if it reaches at least 3% yes, they will get boosted rewards. So I expect that many will vote with their own financial gains in mind, and that therefore all spam proposals will reach 3% yes, and the change you proposed will not have any effect.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-29 21:00:27 UTC | #29

Yes, I’m very confident a 1% threshold will be met if it is required to achieve stage 1 where voting rewards are offered.  Here is my high level assessment of current voting power…

Typical has been 46% total voting power participation on governance proposals when Dfinity votes

22% VP owned by Dfinity and/or ICA
Up to 3% VP following Dfinity
6% VP following cycledao (when they vote first and independently)
2% VP following ICDevs (when they vote first and independently)
2% VP following ICPMN (when they vote first and independently)
Up to 1% VP following some combination of cycledao, ICDevs, and ICPMN
(Also important to note that Cycledao and ICDevs follow each other and/or ICPMN, so most of the time when ICPMN votes No first it cast No votes for all 3 public neurons and when ICDevs votes Yes first it casts Yes votes for both ICDevs and Cycledao)
The remaining 10% are not public neurons and it’s not possible to know who is voting and what is their agenda, but max voting rewards does seem to be a priority.  

Also, when a proposal is submitted that has impact on voting rewards, a lot of voting power (maybe 2-6%) will vote manually before their Followee votes.

The spam has become routine enough now that people just let their followers vote for them instead of trying to make the spam pass.  

My best guess is that there could be up to 15% of total voting power that would be willing to vote for spam in order to get more voting rewards.  Hence a system like this would probably just incentivize voting for spam unless you first remove the incentive for spam for the purpose of voting rewards.  If it takes all the voting power behind public neurons to vote against spam then the proposal might as well be stage 1 already.  

I could end up being wrong about all this, but it’s my best guesstimate after watching voting patterns for the last couple of months.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-04-29 20:45:13 UTC | #30

I think you're right, I think the threshold would be met quickly if stage 1 still provides outsized rewards. What do you think of this?

Love the naming of “Stage0” vs. “Stage1” - it comes through much clearer than “incubation period” 😆.

From the UI side, this could be as easy as having a different tab within the voting page that the user has to click on like “Browse Stage0 proposals”, or a search bar where you have to put in the proposalID.

We need a separate mechanism to handle financial incentives. I believe that actually stems from how governance rewards are weighted coupled with how NNS voting rewards currently work. I detail a potential solution and the issue here - fix the governance rewards so it doesn’t matter if 0 for 1000 governance proposals are submitted in a given time period - the rewards remain the same


https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-fix-governance-proposal-rewards-at-75-on-a-weekly-basis/12417?u=justmythoughts

-------------------------

System1 | 2022-04-29 20:59:22 UTC | #35

I think the plan is good, but I will like to suggest a slight modification. 

1. I think stage 0 should not be for a particular location, but it should be for those that vote manually only. This way the network can ensure its decentralised and everyone can be a gate keeper as long as you decide to vote manually. Also, this will ensure that more informed people, and people that are dedicated to the network will be involved in the decision process.

2. As for the UI, they can just include a button (maybe called it 'council member') can be included in the current UI, and this button will automatically appear immediately you stake, but disappears immediately you become a followee to any body on governance.

3. If the individual decides to start voting manually again by unfollowing any of those known neurons, the button should have a time delay(maybe 14days) before it becomes accessible to them. This way, you can't make a proposal, then unfollow and immediately go and vote on it.

4.As regards the reward, I think there should be something, but it should be very small.

5. As regards the my issue with assigning a particular location, it will not be effective if most of the neurons in that location are followee of a particular known neuron. That will result in some form of centralisation.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-04-29 21:06:33 UTC | #36

I'm not sure what you mean when you use the word "location" here. Can you elaborate?

I think requiring manual voting on stage 0 could be a good idea. I'm curious to know what others think.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-29 21:15:32 UTC | #37

I would agree that stage0 voting should be manual. It ensures there’s enough organic/grassroots support from multiple neurons for a proposal, and also makes it more difficult for a proposal creator to reach the threshold simply by gaining favor with a single neuron.

It’s the closest thing we have to asking for ballot proposition signatures imo (since no proof of personhood).

@justmythoughts @lastmjs 

I haven't commented on the idea of fixed rewards for governance proposals in a while, but there is an aspect of it that I think could become a problem for further decentralization later.  As we move toward Dfinity and the IC community wanting more proposal topics to become decentralized, I think the only way it will happen is if those proposal topics can have high proposal weights like Governance does today (there are other requirements, but proposal weights seems fundamental).  Hence, I'm currently a bit skeptical that fixed Governance rewards is a good idea.  

I don't think proposal weights is the root cause of spam.  I think the root cause is the imbalance in voting participation that is caused by default configurations of Followees.  Default Followees has lead to an expectation that people are entitled to voting rewards because of staking, but entitlement to voting rewards is actually granted only if voting occurs.  Hence, we really need to focus on solving the voting participation problem across different proposal topics as the solution and I don't think fixed governance rewards accomplish that goal (even if it does disincentive spam for financial gain).  Proposal weights moves people to act very quickly and we need that tool available when it is needed again.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-29 21:42:46 UTC | #40

The risk with making stage 0 manual is that whales would fully control the stage 0 outcome and they are the most likely participants to want to allow spam through to stage 1.  Right now ICPMN and ICDevs are accountable to the public because the people behind those organizations care about what the public thinks and they are active in these governance discussions.  Hence, there is incentive to not support spam and to want to do something about it including vote No.

Wenzel, 

If I submit 0 governance proposals then governance rewards make up 0% of rewards for the day.

If I submit 1 governance proposal then governance rewards make up 75% of rewards for the day. 

If I submit 50 proposals then governance rewards make up 99% of rewards for the day.

That’s the problem, clear and simple. Fix the rewards at 75% per day (which is more than enough to incentivize participation).

If there are 10 proposals in that day and you vote on 5/10, you miss out on 50% of the governance rewards you would have received if you had voted on all 10/10 proposals, and those missed rewards are distributed to those who did vote on those proposals.

I think the problem is pretty clear and has nothing to do with decentralization or default followees - see the code for yourself.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-29 22:16:11 UTC | #42

From my observations over the last few days, whales will 100% promote at least one proposal a day to get max rewards.

My 3% proposal that basically did this was halted unless the weights were readjusted. 

With out adjusting the weights, very little works except jacking with peoples neurons(from other experiences they really, really hate this)

I would argue forced manual voting (no followees) incentivizes people to promote their idea and have enough people in the community excited about it that they will go out of their way to organically vote and support a proposal. Sure whales can influence a vote, but how is that any different than the current voting system? I think it’s more dangerous that a single neuron be able to weild influence for a vote than a whale (neurons yield way more voting power)

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-29 22:40:05 UTC | #44

I know we disagree on this point, but if everyone is voting on all types of proposals then there is no reason to submit a spam proposal at all.  It does not advantage a person to submit a spam proposal if there is no voter participation imbalance between Governance and All Topics Except Governance.  The imbalance is artificial due to default Followees for All Topics.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-29 23:21:34 UTC | #45

The spam is caused by the fact that people make profits from proposals. As long as making a proposal more profitable then not making a proposal. Spam will be had.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-29 23:50:40 UTC | #46

Yes, I fully agree.  IMO, there are two ways to eliminate this financial incentive for spam.  Remove proposal weights or incentivize everyone to vote.  The former eliminates spam and stagnates decentralization.  The later eliminates spam while allowing future progress toward decentralization.  I think the greater good is decentralization.

Interesting!

We'd need to tweak stage 0 though to make it a type of sub-community that attracts the kind of regular users we want to have involved.

Personally, I think the whole NNS should use quadratic voting to help reduce the influence of whales. Anything that can be bought can be centralized, period.

For stage 0 the voting should be either quadratic if not 1-to-1 to enforce a level playing field. Of course, this would make proof-of-humanity even more critical, but any well designed Governance system will need to solve that issue so it's hardly unique to this approach.

Then, one interesting thing to try might be blind voting with both rewards and penalties. No one can see the running tally of votes during stage 0 until a resolution is determined by the system on whether it moves to stage 1, and then from there things work like normal and the NNS determines an outcome. If during stage 0 you voted with the final outcome (for example if you voted to approve the proposal and it ultimately passed all stages) you get a bonus neuron reward, but if you voted against the final outcome (a vote against a proposal which gets approved or vice versa) then a small penalty is applied against your neuron rewards (you lose some current or future maturity).

Basically, this would make stage 0 a higher risk/reward playground for nerds who are interesting in being active in the nitty gritty NNS operations, and it'll require everyone who contributes to bringing a proposal up for full attention to have some skin in the game. Incentivizing voting is important, but at some point it's good to also penalize thoughtless and careless voting. It may make sense to do that at stage 0.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-04-30 15:11:03 UTC | #51

What I hope we can all start to agree on is a multi-stage process. I think it should start simple, but with a multi-stage process we could start to experiment with different voting mechanisms in a scoped way, without changing the final NNS process that is currently functioning to some extent.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-30 17:30:00 UTC | #52

One technical detail left out of this proposal is if one’s vote on a stage 0 proposal should apply to stage 1 if the proposal passes stage 0.

From a user experience/educational perspective, I think it’s important that if this change is made the NNS includes “i” (informational) tooltips or links specific to the new voting and rewards mechanisms in place. We want voters to understand what their voting responsibilities are, and don’t want voters feeling like potential rewards opportunities are being hidden from them.

I think there’s decent community support for this proposal, but we should now move to flushing out the UX a tad more before submission. That extra will give the community a week or so more to digest the new mechanisms and think about edge cases.

-------------------------

emiss | 2022-04-30 17:32:43 UTC | #53

like this idea ..

spam/junk proposal will be rejected and proposer lose 1 ICP since there won't be any reward. Since all the previous spam proposals are rejected , is safe to say that spam proposal can never pass stage 0 .

very good point , i wouldn't want to keep voting . if it pass .. it shouldn't even need to go stage 1 .. all votes should be awarded automatically and start to implement the proposal

I really like this idea, however I think the community is focused on it for the wrong perspective.

The conversation in the forum has focused on this idea as a spam prevention tool.  I think that's short sighted and focused on putting out current fires.

However, this idea has a lot of potential to improve the long term ability for the NNS community to make good decisions.  It does this by:
1. Reducing the amount of noise by limiting the number of proposals that reach mainstream voting.
2. Mandates a 2-week deliberation time.  This should give the community an opportunity to discuss (although ideally the community would have had a chance to discuss prior).

Ultimately a multi-step process for governance proposal (or eventually a multi-branched process) is needed for the NNS to be more disciplined in decision making.  I think this is a good first step.

I think this might be a good long-term solution for the current spam problem. I'm trying to think of ways this can be abused, but I don't see many. The only that comes to mind if whales see a stage 0 spam governance proposal they might try to accept it into stage 1 in order to get the reward. One would hope there is more honest active voting which would be enough to reject all (or most) of these at stage 0.

Can we try to get some agreement on the simplest possible multi-stage setup? Perhaps we can launch with some simple parameters and change them after we can observe for a period of time. Here's what I suggest:

Stage 0 proposal rules:
1. Rejection cost of 1 ICP
2. Threshold for adoption of 1% (same mechanisms for adoption/rejection as other proposals, just a different threshold)
3. Lifetime of 2 weeks (proposals cannot pass before this time, if not passed by the end of the lifetime the proposal is automatically rejected)
4. No affect on voting rewards
5. UI doesn't change besides removing the option to filter the Governance topic, and having two new topics called Governance Stage 0 and Governance Stage 1
6. After the lifetime, if the proposal has been adopted then a stage 1 proposal with the exact same information will automatically be created

Stage 1 proposal rules:
1. Same behavior as current governance proposals

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-05-02 13:25:38 UTC | #58

If a proposal moves from stage 0 to stage 1, then all voting should start over.  There are too many reasons why a person would choose yes for stage 0 to push a proposal to stage 1, but wouldn’t want it to pass stage 1.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-05-02 13:27:05 UTC | #59

I agree, do the rules I laid out not imply that?

-------------------------

chepreghy | 2022-05-02 13:50:20 UTC | #60

But this would mean that no rejected proposals would give voting rewards (if rejected in stage 0). Since a lot of regular non-spam proposals also get rejected, wouldn't this change reward distributions?

Maybe in stage 0 we can just vote spam / not spam, or rewording it somehow that we vote the proposal to be brought to stage 1 where it still might get rejected. In this way I might vote "yes" on a legitimate proposal that I disagree with just to later on in stage 1 vote "reject".

I disagree - why should someone support a proposal that they disagree with just to give it visibility? The two week deliberation period is for getting people to finalize their viewpoints on a particular issue. If we wanted separate votes, like in primaries or state propositions one would put the proposal out there first, let it hit the 1% threshold, then have a 1-2+ week period of community deliberation, and finally put the proposal to a vote.

Additionally, once the proposal passes the 1% threshold it goes straight to a wait for quiet vote of a much shorter time period (can pass in 1-2 days). Someone who voted in Stage0 could miss their vote in Stage1. Additionally, voters to vote differently in Stage0 than Stage1 (on the exact same proposal) opens up the door for exactly what @wpb mentions, one might support proposals that they do not agree with to make them visible. Visibility should come from reaching a threshold of honest voluntary support, not from those who want to support a proposal in order for it to be advertised to all NNS voters, or worse - just so they can reject it in Stage1 and receive more governance rewards.

@lastmjs one other thing, if my argument above ends up being unpopular and you/the community think this should constitute two separate votes (one for stage0 and one for stage1), can we view neuron voting history via the same mechanisms as currently to see how that neuron voted in both stage 0 and stage 1 (For transparency)?

Hi all,

I recently joined the Dfinity governance team and I am very much looking forward to discussing the various proposals on spam prevention with the community. This is a pretty interesting and important topic!

To facilitate and structure the discussion, I propose that we define a grid of goals against which we can assess proposals. As you will see, many of these goals link well to arguments made in the discussion in this (and related) threads.

Below you will find

1. proposed goals of the voting process for the assessment
2. initial assessment of the multi stage proposal against these goals
3. some open points for further discussion

Please let me know your thoughts on A and/or B!

Overall, I think that voting in stages could be a promising improvement for the NNS governance, where however several open points and trade-offs require further discussion. 

—---------------

**Proposed goals of the voting process to ensure secure & functional governance**

* Decentralized & active: No centralized authority is required for any part of the voting process. Broad and active participation of the community.
* Purposeful: Proposals should not be misused/bogus. For example not for
  * Skewing financial rewards without meaningful proposals -> This links to the kind of spam we observed recently.
  * Displaying bad/inappropriate content to users
* Scalable: The process remains practicable when the Inter computer and its community increase in size over time.
* Reactive: High priority items (e.g. urgent subnet update) can be approved quickly.
* Accessible: Low barriers for entry. Also users with small staked amounts can propose and contribute to the discussion.
* Efficient: The voting process can be completed efficiently by voters. For example it is efficient to identify worthy proposals and easy to vote 

**Initial assessment of the multi stage proposal**

* Decentralized & active: *neutral*.
* Purposeful no reward skew: *neutral/slightly positive*. More effort is required to get to the overall vote. However, only partially addresses this issue, as there is still a financial incentive to bring spam proposals to the general vote in order to collect governance rewards.
* Purposeful no bad content: *positive*. Seems like a pragmatic way to not show inappropriate content as part of the overall vote.
* Scalable: *positive*. Only proposals supported by a certain amount of voting power will be submitted to an overall vote. This prepares for a future with many more gov proposals.
* Reactive: *neutral*. Assuming that voting in stages only applies to governance proposals, this should not affect reactivity of urgent updates.
* Accessible: *neutral/slightly negative*. Makes it more difficult to get proposals to an overall voting stage. However, in order to get a proposal passed eventually, you need to gather prior support in forums anyway. Thus, this is not really an extra barrier.
* Efficient: *neutral*. Assuming that we are able to define an efficient (UX) user workflow. 

**Some open questions (from my perspective)**
* Would default following apply to the initial round?
* How to decide on the right threshold?
* What is the (financial) incentive for participating in the initial round ?

Thank you @bjoernek.  It’s nice to have someone from Dfinity get involved in these discussions.

My comments below assume we resolve spam for the purpose of economic gain by proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) or something similar.  My comments here would be significantly different otherwise.

[quote="bjoernek, post:64, topic:12534"]

[/quote]
I suggest default vote following should apply.

[quote="bjoernek, post:64, topic:12534"]
How to decide on the right threshold?
[/quote]
It should probably be low initially, but a parameter than can be easily changed.


[quote="bjoernek, post:64, topic:12534"]

I think it makes sense for there to be no financial incentive for stage 0.  I’m not opposed to a financial incentive though.

[quote="bjoernek, post:64, topic:12534"]

I say just start somewhat low like 1% and see how it works. If nothing can pass or if too much spam is getting through we can observe and change it.

To keep it simple and to make stage 0 work as intended, I suggest no financial incentive for voting in stage 0. Part of the benefit of stage 0 may be that more altruistic or objective participants will be the ones getting proposals to progress to the next stage. It may take more effort from those promoting a proposal since the economic incentive is removed. Of course the incentive remains once the proposal is promoted to stage 1.

As time progresses we can tweak as needed.

emiss | 2022-05-03 06:16:33 UTC | #68

would love to hear the reasons ... because I can't think of any .

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-05-03 09:15:15 UTC | #69

spam for the purpose of higher voting rewards will be voted past stage 0 by a lot of people

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-05-03 10:49:22 UTC | #70

What would be the consequence on getting rewards on governance voting only?
It would solve everything.
Who can, have the knowledge, to vote for or against everything else other then Dfinity?
All other topic can still be voted but with no rewards.
Is this a crazy idea?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-05-03 10:59:29 UTC | #71

I think there is truth to this idea today, but I also understand that the vision for the future is that most or all topics will eventually become decentralized.  I think people and organizations will form that have the expertise to propose, advise, and vote on the other topics.  I suspect that is why voting rewards are not currently allocated to the Governance topic only.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-05-03 11:19:10 UTC | #72

Yes, understand.  But my idea was only for the rewards distribution.  So voting for everything else can still keep going on for decentralization, on a volunteer basis.  But rewards would apply to governance voting only.
I donˋt see anything bad with this.
So simple too and it make sense too.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-05-03 15:45:25 UTC | #73

We should always keep as premise that the majority of people will always act in order to maximise the rewards, whatever the plan we figure. It has to be a constant for our maths.

@diegop I would love to hear your thoughts on this multi-stage proposal idea

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-05-06 14:50:36 UTC | #75

This idea linked below was posted last night and I think it has a lot of potential.  It’s another proposal that enables voters to designate a proposal as spam during the voting period with a new button or check box.  The big difference from other similar proposals so far is the actions that are taken when a proposal is identified as spam.  

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/simple-idea-to-prevent-spam-and-increase-proposal-quality/12764

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-05-07 23:16:35 UTC | #76

What if during stage 0 votes were hidden and at the end of voting period only those who voted with the majority get rewarded with the same weight as system proposals? 

This way voters are incentivized to pick what they think the majority's decision will be, which in case of spam proposal is pretty obvious and they are incentivized to vote but rewards aren't high enough to justify the rejection cost on the spammer's side. 

If the proposal passes stage 0 then rejection cost is 0 or reverted back to 1ICP or some fixed value in cycles.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-05-08 00:12:23 UTC | #77

I still think a “quorum” of yes votes where the vote gets extended to the base amount when it passes accomplishes the same thing with just one line of code. Add a filter to the NNS as it is basically the same thing with slightly shorter periods.

-------------------------

dx111 | 2022-06-09 17:03:48 UTC | #78

Maybe we don't need a threshold. The three proposals that get the most votes every day can enter stage 1
