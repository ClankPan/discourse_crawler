## **Project highlights**

Accelar is a one-stop plataform for building, launching, and managing both web2 and web3 functionalities seamlessly. To bridge the gap for web2 users and developers who are new to the web3 space. With Accelar, you are capable of creating dapp features, managing blockchain wallets, canisters, web2 containers like llm instances, allowing you to unify and accelerate your development process and software automations.

## **Web3 advantages**

By allowing users to deploy web3 components with a custodial wallet, you can aggregate all your product development steps in one place and accelerate the process of development. By allowing web2 API connections with automations that can trigger web3 interactions, we interconnect both worlds, expanding functionalities that before were only possible in web2 (like using Zapier).

## **How is it built**

Accelar is built on top of a variety of frameworks to enable all its functionalities. For interactions with the Internet Computer Protocol and creation of identities, we use node-pty to programmatically execute calls in the terminal. For features involving the deployment of LLM containers, we utilize AWS. For automation processes and interconnection, we intend to build on top of our monolith in NestJS, which is already in operation. To allow instant messages and notifications between users and services (user <> backend), we implement websocket ([socket.io](http://socket.io)) workflows.

## **Internet Computer superpowers**

To manage everything related to ICP (identity creation, wallet and canister deployments, transaction endpoints, interactions, etc.), we utilize the **`dfx`** (DFINITY command-line execution environment).

## **Go-To-Market strategy**

The main strategy involves connecting with several chains (being a multi-chain low-code platform) and interacting with these communities to test and validate the platform's features. After that, we aim to reach companies and startups that want to be part of the web3 environment but don't have full-time, specialized web3 developers. Once we reach a validation point sufficient to start monetizing, a marketing campaign will be set up to reach this broader audience.

## **Monetization**

The platform will be credit-based; users need to have credits on the platform to operate interactions and deployments. This can be achieved by having a paid subscription plan. In addition, a free tier offering $5 of monthly credit will be made available.

## **Status of the project**

The following features are already available on the platform:

* Creation of custodial ICP identities;
* Deployment of canisters (two templates: hello world and POC vector database)
* Deployment of wallet canisters
* UI canister integration to interact with the deployed canisters
* Create transfer transactions with wallet canisters
* Workspace members' management
* Workspace chat feature
* Workspace Kanban feature
* Deployment of LLM instances (two templates from Hugging Face: NLP and Falcon 7B)
* Interaction with LLM instances (question/answer workflow)

## **Future Plans**

Next steps:

**Automated workflow integrations**

* **New section in Accelar plataform to create automated workflows in a "node-like" dashboard (similar to Zapier).**
* **Creating integrations with web2 and web3 triggers (canisters automated interactions).**
* **Example use-case for trading scheme: Every 15 min analyze words context in twitter from accounts x, y, z -> If mood for crypto xyz is positive -> create buy transaction in liquidity pool from my wallet abc.**

**Online IDE and deployer**

* **New section in Accelar plataform to write canisters code, compile and deploy it with workspace`s wallets**
* **Playground to test your code**
* **Plataform will enable to deploy any type of canister, not only the currently "templates" one**
* **With a auto-save and file management, users from the same workspace will be able to work together in canisters development**

Cool project; regarding the "Automated workflow" integration, is a node based app enough to handle all the proccess?

For this first version, I believe so. I`ve already done some tests with my NestJs app and it ran pretty well for this workflows. But yes, in the future, as more users enter the plataform, I do think it will be needed to create a whole service to just handle this part.
