Hey everyone, I am trying to figure out an error when I run the command "dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet <canister-identifer>", the error I get is "The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 403 Forbidden, content type "", content: Requested canister rejected the message". I have ICP and I've converted them to cycles already. I am following the network deployment quick start tutorial.

Thank you everyone for your time and help in solving this.

Hi Jared, can you break down the steps you've taken already? When you say you've converted ICP to cycles already, have you used them to create a canister that will host your cycles wallet?

While we're at it, what is the output of the command ```dfx identity --network ic get-wallet```?

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 21:49:38 UTC | #3

I am following the network deployment quick start guide here https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html

I have gotten all the way down to the paragraph labeled "Convert ICP tokens to cycles", I did step one no problem but when I get to step 2 where it tells me to run the command dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet <canister-identifer> is where I get the 403 forbidden error. 

When I run dfx identity --network ic get-wallet I get: 
Creating a wallet canister on the ic network.
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content: <html>

Sorry I didnt answer this question "When you say you’ve converted ICP to cycles already, have you used them to create a canister that will host your cycles wallet"

I think I did, that is done with command "dfx ledger --network ic create-canister <principal-identifier> --amount <icp-tokens>", is that correct?

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 21:53:12 UTC | #5

Okay great, so you have a canisterId to point at, created from the `dfx ledger --network ic create-canister <principal-identifier> --amount <icp-tokens>` command

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 21:56:21 UTC | #6

I may be wrong about this, but I think you may need to set that canisterId as your wallet first before deploying, with the current logic in `dfx`. That will look like

```dfx identity --network ic set-wallet <canister-id>```, and you may need to run that command with `--force` at the end. 

Then, the `deploy-wallet` command may go through. If this works like I think it should, I can update the guide for the next person to come along

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 21:57:13 UTC | #7

Ok let me give that a shot and I will let you know thank you

Ok so I ran dfx identity --network ic set-wallet <canister-id> and this is the error I got

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:16:42 UTC | #9

Are you on dfx 0.7.2?

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 22:19:09 UTC | #10

![Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 16.18.19|690x114](upload://xS37uFD7lv81085UuRZ81s6JVpR.png)
 
oof no, I'm on 0.7.1

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:20:02 UTC | #11

Here's a helpful snippet I use to keep my version up to date:

```
dfxv () {
	if [ -n "$1" ]
	then
		export DFX_VERSION="$1"
	fi
	sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
}
```

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 22:21:47 UTC | #12

That is helpful thank you, so update then try again with the dfx identity --network ic set-wallet <canister-id> command?

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:22:39 UTC | #13

I'd try it again just to see, but the more likely outcome is that `deploy-wallet` will work this time

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 22:23:10 UTC | #14

ok great, let me try and I'll let you know

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 22:31:26 UTC | #15

![Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 16.26.42|678x108](upload://4jz9hyK8eCuN1xumHo8Q6l6oBQ4.png)

Ok updated but still getting same error I ran dfx identity --network ic set-wallet <canister-id> --force and still got the no wasm module error, I also updated the version in my dfx.json to 0.7.2

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 22:32:07 UTC | #16

![Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 16.30.16|690x53](upload://2X4zanTY7IOJOAZOusDmvbIMkZt.png)

this error here

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:32:44 UTC | #17

and deploy-wallet is still giving you the 403 error?

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-21 22:33:14 UTC | #18

it is yes, giving me the same 403 error

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:34:46 UTC | #19

Hmm, I know a workaround, but it's pretty kludgey.

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:41:37 UTC | #20

**Not recommended**
The workaround I have done before is: 
clone https://github.com/dfinity/cycles-wallet

add a `canister_ids.json` file with the following code:
```
{
  "wallet": {
    "ic": "<canister-id>"
  }
}
```
Then run 

`dfx build wallet`
`dfx canister --network ic --no-wallet install wallet`
`dfx identity --network ic set-wallet <canister-id>`
`dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-21 22:54:05 UTC | #21

I've created an issue to improve the deploy-wallet command https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/1723

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-23 04:21:14 UTC | #22

Sorry about not being able to respond to you yesterday, I ran out of how many times I could post as a new user. 

So I tried your steps and the first steps gives me an error of "wallet/build.sh: line 18: cargo: command not found"

I've also added the canister_ids.json file like 

Attached is the screen shot of line where it is calling out the error

kpeacock | 2021-06-23 15:37:33 UTC | #23

That makes sense - it assumes you are set up to compile Rust code. I'll spend some time today getting up to speed with workflows to host your first canister, and hopefully have a better strategy for you

-------------------------

jarededrake | 2021-06-23 20:44:13 UTC | #24

Ok great thank you for the help

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-06-23 22:26:49 UTC | #25

I can confirm that this is happening with all flows that start with an empty canister, and I don't know of a proper workaround. We'll prioritize a fix so that `deploy-wallet` works as expected

-------------------------

peterparker | 2021-07-30 06:42:55 UTC | #26

Just gonna let that here in case it would help someone some day as I just faced the exact same issue / msg:

> Installing code for canister ......, with canister_id .....
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 403 Forbidden, content type "", content: Requested canister rejected the message

I successfully created the canister in the nns app and also configured it correctly locally but, I forgot to change the controllers (assign my personal principal id to the new canister) in nns app. Once done, everything went alright.

-------------------------

tommccann | 2021-08-20 01:52:01 UTC | #27

I'm getting the same error. I created a canister (funded with 2T cycles). I set the controller to my principal id. When I come to deploy I see this:

sakoma.icp | 2021-10-12 13:04:46 UTC | #29

It looks like when the new cycles wallet is created, it is NOT assigned to your principal. There is one step missing for that : dfx ....set wallet.

In practice, that Convert Cycles section of the tutorial should be modified to include the 3 step
1 - dfx ledger --network ic create-canister <principal-identifier> --amount  NbICPTokens

2 - dfx identity --network ic set-wallet --force NewlyCreatedCyclesCanisterID

3 - dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet  canisterd


Step 2 is missing.

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-12 13:35:14 UTC | #30

Hmmm looks like this suspicious set-wallet command is the one that is unblocking the management-canister, see this: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/403-error-when-i-call-the-management-canister/7619

-------------------------

sakoma.icp | 2021-10-12 14:32:56 UTC | #31

Exact. When the cyclesWallet is first created, the creators principal is not assigned as a controller. Somehow this is where the permission issue stems from. Fleek/Plu got this and even included the command in the faucet claim process...so i don't get why Dfinity has not taken that into account in the tutorial. and so many people get stuck here. This should be a priority update with clear explanation if not include the assignement directly into the cycle creation process.  This is a major showstopper for newcommers.

-------------------------

levi | 2021-10-12 16:50:26 UTC | #32

@chenyan @diegop the person(s) who wrote the code for the set-wallet command must know what is going on here.

Thanks for the heads up. Ill ping team

I ran through the steps in the [Network Quickstart Tutorial](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html), and ended up with a functional wallet after doing so.

When I tried interjecting a step 2 (`dfx identity set-wallet`), I ended up with a wallet with no wasm, that I could neither deploy to, stop, nor delete.

`dfx ledger create-canister` requires a controller to be passed.  Maybe this was not always the case.

This is what happened when I followed the linked tutorial:

```
$ dfx --identity mainnet identity get-principal       
cjxsv-7ook7-vgkeq-5kaih-2e4u3-fg2to-miupt-fgrrn-dfpza-2vxa5-zae

```

@ericswanson try to create a canister in the nns-frontend and then add the dfx controller as a controller and then use dfx to deploy a wallet onto it. See if you can get that to work without doing the set-wallet command (by the way it seems like it needs the set-wallet **—force** option).

I'm trying to do the bootcamp pre-reqs and also ran into this error.  I got free cycles from the [faucet](https://faucet.dfinity.org/) and used the given command to set-wallet.  BTW, it seems the --no-wallet flag is no longer valid.

My wallet:
auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ dfx identity --network ic get-wallet
qpjy5-viaaa-aaaai-abtjq-cai

My canisters:
auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ more canister_ids.json

  },
  "hello_assets": {

  }
}

Deploy command and output:

My wallet controllers:

m275j-shcik-avikq-yasar-thfg4-zvwki-cwrxz-dljkm-ky5ng-s7wbp-4ae

auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ dfx wallet --network ic balance
6899945090470 cycles.

My balance is 8T cycles lower due to the 2 deployed canisters above.

My canister controllers is my cycles wallet canister:
auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ dfx canister  --network ic info q5ppe-zyaaa-aaaai-abtkq-cai
Controllers: qpjy5-viaaa-aaaai-abtjq-cai
Module hash: None
auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ dfx canister  --network ic info qumey-pqaaa-aaaai-abtla-cai
Controllers: qpjy5-viaaa-aaaai-abtjq-cai
Module hash: None

My principal and ledger account ids:
auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ dfx identity get-principal
m275j-shcik-avikq-yasar-thfg4-zvwki-cwrxz-dljkm-ky5ng-s7wbp-4ae

auchan@epsilon:~/ic-projects/hello$ dfx ledger account-id
349e10caa5ff4f990aeda88c60e97190adc80927f06b59133ab6061eebc6cb66

So I believe I have a different error as my principal is the controller for my cycle wallet, and my cycle wallet is the controller for my canisters.

EDIT - turns out you need your principal to be the controller for all deployed canisters (cycle wallet as controller is not enough)

Follow the commands listed in the release notes to upgrade your wallet and set controller properly for all deployed canisters.

dfx wallet --network ic upgrade
[/quote]

A place to start is 
```dfx canister --network ic info $(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)```
to find out the controllers of your wallet, and
```dfx identity get-principal```

If the principal of your identity isn't found among the controllers of the wallet, then determine if your wallet is controlled by another of your identities.

ericswanson | 2022-03-04 20:31:29 UTC | #41

Any chance it was an nns identity?  Or are you sure it was an identity that is now lost?

-------------------------

der0pa | 2022-03-04 21:21:16 UTC | #42

Original dev account was named default in dfx 0.8.0 version
Seemed to be overwritten by not running `dfx wallet update` before running full ic deploy with 0.9.0
Thinking upgrade command must have copied orig default principal to new default/admin identity so access would not be lost to older cycles wallets like mine. Its got 130 TCycles so it would be nice to use it. Live and learn ;)

-------------------------

ericswanson | 2022-03-04 22:20:33 UTC | #43

`dfx wallet upgrade` doesn't overwrite any identities.  It just upgrades the wasm in the canister.

-------------------------
