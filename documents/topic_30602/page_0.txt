We are using http_request query call as follows

```rust
#[ic_cdk_macros::query]
fn http_request(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse {
```

There is this paragraph in the IC specification on http_request (https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-http_request)

Since query calls have 0 cycles charged, does this apply only for http_request update calls ? Or is it different in the case of http_request and both are charged ?

This is an unfortunate naming clash. `http_request` in the [spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec) refers to the management canister's function `http_request` which performs an HTTPS outcall. It cannot be called as/from a query call.

The function you're implementing (sadly also called `http_request`, but this time defined on your own canister) is defined in the [HTTP gateway spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec) instead. It's the one that is called as a query when someone tries to load your canister in the browser.
