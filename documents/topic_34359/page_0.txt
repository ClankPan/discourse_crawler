Hello,
My canister frequently encounters errors when fetching data via HTTP outcalls, such as: "RpcRequestError("(SysTransient) "No consensus could be reached. Replicas had different responses. ..." Even with deterministic data, this error occurs often. To debug this, I added logs in my custom transform method, but I found that these logs are not accessible on the IC mainnet. Is there any other way to print or capture the content of TransformArgs?

This is expected as the transform function runs in non-replicated mode which is currently not supported by the canister logging feature (in other words, logs are only accessible for replicated executions).

I don't think there's a better way now to debug on mainnet unfortunately. Your best bet would be to try it out locally where you can get access to logs in dfx.
