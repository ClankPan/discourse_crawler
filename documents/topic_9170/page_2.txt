Yes, it is not required for now. But soon it will be required with ETH integration I believe.

Hello Everyone,

I trust you're doing well. I'm in the process of registering a new Data centre in Vilnius, Lithuania. I aim to onboard a number of nodes in the coming months.

Check out my proposal on the ICP Dashboard: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124534

Should you need more details or have questions, please feel free to contact me. Your support and votes for my proposal are greatly appreciated!

Kind regards,

George

Hi all,

The remuneration model V2.1 (voted in by the community, see [Proposal: 122281 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122281)) is the current basis for the node machine rewards of Gen2 Node Providers. Based on this remuneration model, new node machines have been onboarded and are in the process of being onboarded in Hong Kong, India, South Africa, as well as in Europe, all of which will greatly help in the decentralization of the IC-network.

With plans from the community to set up Node Providers in other new locations as well, specifically in South Korea, Georgia, Sri Lanka and Australia, the remuneration for setting up node machines in these countries needs to be added in the reward table. You can find the additional entries for these countries on the wiki page (see [Node Provider Remuneration - Internet Computer Wiki ](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration)) and find the proposal here: [Proposal: 123312 - IC Dashboard ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123312).

Depending on the growth of the IC-network, the remuneration table will be updated and refined for new geographies. Any updates will be posted as a new proposal to be voted upon by the community.

Hello, can you please tell me, I don't see Kazakhstan here, which mult(g) should I use ? 3 as for Asia?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-10-19 12:16:40 UTC | #214

Hi @mrpablo there currently is no entry in the remuneration table for Kazakhstan so it is not possible to add node machines in Kazakhstan. There currently are blog posts and discussion regarding the future IC topology on the forum (see https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-series-node-diversification-part-i/23402 and https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-node-diversification-part-ii/23553). Based on these, a motion proposal will be submitted for discussion and voting by the community, which might take into account adding new countries to the remuneration table. Hope this answers your question.

Can it be placed on the territory of Ukraine? Does it belong to Europe?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-10-20 07:54:08 UTC | #217

HI @mrpablo that was not the intention of the remuneration proposal when the community voted this in. I suggest to wait for the motion proposal that is coming up in the next few weeks.

-------------------------

mrpablo | 2023-10-20 09:10:25 UTC | #218

@SvenF In few weeks will the rewards and countries be changed?

@mrpablo that will depend on the community voting on the upcoming proposals, but I would expect updates coming up yes.

mrpablo | 2023-10-23 20:26:31 UTC | #220

@SvenF If I put one node in Spain and the second in France, I do not fall under the reduction factor? I will receive the full 1542+1542 for each node?

Is the reduction factor to the Country, City or date center?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-10-24 07:32:46 UTC | #221

Hi @mrpablo, the reduction coefficient is currently per node provider per country.

-------------------------

johnnychen | 2023-10-25 07:28:13 UTC | #222

Hi all, I looked at the distribution map of node runners and the location of existing data centers and found that no node providers or data centers exist within China, is it because no one is going to do this or is the network environment within China not able to join the icp's network?

-------------------------

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-10-25 09:01:06 UTC | #223

Abit of insight, china is a closed internet economy, you can not deploy any internet-related services without being registered as a business in the country. For that, you need to be a citizen. Even if you check all the tick boxes. The firewall is going to block almost all the connections going out, and for that, you need special approval.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2023-10-25 09:25:07 UTC | #224

HongKong is belong to China, in HongKong you can.

-------------------------

johnnychen | 2023-10-25 10:21:03 UTC | #225

So if I need to deploy a node inside China, I need to go to the government and apply for my network to be unrestricted or connected to the outside world through a dedicated line?

-------------------------

johnnychen | 2023-10-25 10:21:46 UTC | #226

I wonder if it's feasible for me to go through a dedicated line? Has anyone else tried it?

-------------------------

mrpablo | 2023-11-14 17:48:43 UTC | #227

@SvenF Does the presence of Subnets affect rewards for node providers?
If a node has awaiting subnet status, does it still get rewards?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-11-14 20:16:30 UTC | #228

Hi @mrpablo, yes, nodes that are awaiting to enter a subnet also get the node rewards.

With plans from the community to set up Node Providers in other new locations as well, specifically in South Korea, Georgia, Sri Lanka and Australia, the remuneration for setting up node machines in these countries needs to be added in the reward table.

Hi all, there is an update to the remuneration table to accomodate the latest locations where node machines are going to be set up, i.e. Israel, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and New Zealand. You can find the additional entries for these countries on the wiki page (see [Node Provider Remuneration - Internet Computer Wiki ](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration)) and find the proposal here https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/127033 for your voting.

Hello all,

Are you accepting node providers from Pakistan? I am looking to setup nodes there and currently do not see any nodes in that country.

Best,

Q

-------------------------

qwerty | 2024-04-03 13:17:49 UTC | #235

Hello,

Any information on this? Would like to setup a node in Pakistan when you begin to allow more nodes on the network.

Best,

Q

-------------------------

louisevelayo | 2024-04-03 13:39:11 UTC | #236

Hi @qwerty ,

Super great that you're interested. For the time being, what you could do is to register as a node provider already. I suggest following all the steps [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Roadmap).

I would suggest completing everything up to and including [milestone 3, step 4.8](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding#8._Register_your_Node_Provider_principal_to_the_network). You could also do step 4.9 of milestone 3 if you already know what data center you'd like to set up your nodes in!

-------------------------

qwerty | 2024-04-03 14:52:29 UTC | #237

Thank you for your response. I will go ahead and do those things but I just wanted to make sure that Pakistan is allowed as a country for a node provider. I read somewhere that you will no longer be adding any more entries for country. If that is the case then it wouldn't make sense for me to proceed if you will not allow a node in Pakistan when the need for more node operators arise.

Best,

Q

-------------------------

louisevelayo | 2024-04-03 15:50:57 UTC | #238

Hi @qwerty ,

I think the "no new entries for countries" is inline with the fact that no new nodes are allowed to be onboarded for the moment. 

But that being said, I believe Pakistan is not listed in the last table on [this page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration). Therefore, one essential step is to make sure to gather enough information on the projects costs: hardware costs, data center colocation costs and connectivity costs. 

Once you have this data, you should share it with the community so that it can be added to this table!
