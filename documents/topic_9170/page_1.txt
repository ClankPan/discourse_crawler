Hi Bjoern,

If this cap is just a technical measure in case automation fails, what sort of protections do you have in case the algorithmic stablecoin nature of ICP/cycles fails and leads to a death spiral?

This setup unfortunately reminds me a little too much of Terra/UST, although in this case an "attack" is much more difficult because users cannot simply burn cycles for ICP. However, it is not difficult to imagine a scenario where developers burn a lot of ICP for cycles, the exchange rate of ICP/XDR falls, and ICP holders are severely diluted when paying node providers.

This scenario is even more dire when you consider that we are also using cycles as a stablecoin for Defi on the IC ([Dank's XTC](https://dank.ooo/xtc/)). If a lot of XTC is minted when ICP prices are high (you can imagine that this might potentially be orders of magnitude greater than the cycles used for powering canisters), then when ICP prices are low we would have a huge supply of cycles "backed" by a much smaller amount of ICP. And relief of this supply pressure only happens very slowly as canisters consume cycles.

Has this been a concern at DFINITY? I can imagine there are a few potential fixes that might alleviate this up to a certain extent, but I think this is an intrinsic problem with an algorithmic stablecoin that is not 100% backed. I know you want to keep the deflationary nature of ICP when minting cycles, but you cannot simply create a "stable" currency out of thin air by burning your own token.

For example, instead of burning ICP when minting cycles, the ICA could potentially sell this ICP on the market and hedge by buying XDR (in fiat currency) and keeping these as reserves. Or we could introduce some inflation for all cycles to disincentivise holding cycles/XTC.

Or the simplest solution: why not get rid of cycles altogether? Just pay for computation at a variable rate determined by the NNS? Having a stablecoin is a great idea, but I think the current implementation is a little bit risky. And frankly it is yet another project that DFINITY is undertaking that is not fundamentally necessary for the IC to function. You could use ICP, use another established stablecoin like USDC, use BTC, or even use a combination of all of these.

@Luis How are we progressing on the original roadmap that opened this forum thread? I can't seem to piece together how we stand. Are we behind? Are we hitting the quarterly milestones? I'd love some updates and would love to know how to follow progress.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-07 01:45:17 UTC | #109

I noticed Dom tweeted about a medium post coming out imminently about node decentralization which now appears deleted ! Dum dum dum

-------------------------

Luis | 2022-08-08 13:21:08 UTC | #110

@dfisher I'm not following all of Dom's tweets and I'm not aware that there is any change in the platform decentralisation decided. I'd recommend to attend the public, global RnD. This is where such decisions would be announced. Also internally. 

@lastmjs We already missed quarterly milestones end of the first quarter. I must admit that I didn't thought about updating the complete roadmap to that and other delays. 

TLDR; The delay in the roadmap is mainly caused a higher prioritisation of the BTC and SNS feature and by the decision to finish the storage upgrade on all nodes until end of the year. This also led to the decision to change the way we are setting milestones and thereby untangle dependencies in deliverables. See @samuelburri's [explanation in last public global RnD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-MNbRpjSa0). 
The total delay is mainly impacting the workflow optimisation for NP onboarding and the network growth with these new NP and a Milan-based new node type. There's still a chance for completing that roadmap by EOY.    

I'm referring to [this pseudo-gantt from last year November](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/2?u=luis). 

Deliverable (A) Reproducible builds: I don't have the exact time when this was delivered but the corresponding build code is public since January when the corresponding builds passed the acceptance tests. We published a recording of that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu7cRbIX5e8&ab_channel=DFINITY). 

Deliverable (B) Autonomous Node Deployments: Technically it was done in January with the reproducible builds. The remaining work that was shown for the first quarter was mainly targeting NNS frontend DApp integrations. This was descoped in March because the corresponding team was still working on reworking the complete frontend code to svelt. 
We had to rework some details regarding deterministic IPv6 assignments and regarding a VSOCK implementation that allows the replica to do changes on the host system. Due to that delay the rollout "Swap D0 nodes by D1 nodes" [started end of Q2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/105?u=luis) and not end of Q1. 
This also delayed the future NP onboarding which is meant to complement [the current CLI based onboarding](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding) with UI supported workflow. In addition we decided that we would prefer to onboard new Milan-based hardware and not modify the existing Rome-based hardware. I expect [the corresponding motion proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/draft-motion-proposal-new-hardware-specification-and-remuneration-for-ic-nodes/14202?u=luis) to be placed soon which bring us back on schedule for deliverable (E) Next Node Hardware Generation. 

Deliverable (D) NNS-driven data center allocation is still in the design phase. There two things blocking us from starting the implementation: First the NNS team is still focused on the BTC and SNS feature and secondly we found out that the decentralisation code that we currently use to create subnets and replace nodes needs a better testing (more edge cases) before we can integrate it into the NNS. The current node replacements for the storage upgrades help a lot in this regards.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-09-01 20:26:47 UTC | #111

Thanks @Luis. Also including @diegop, and flagging both @lastmjs and @bob11 given they have recently flagged the centralization of node providers as a key concern.   

I think it would be helpful to more clearly and regularly update the community on how steps (A) through (D) are going, and specifically timelines expected. 

Without getting into the weeds on steps (A) through (D), the community should also have a good sense of how many node providers / owners we can expect in Q3, Q4, Q1'23, Q2'23 etc. The expectation on node provider count right now is super confusing. Realize there are many components to decentralization in a node provider context that comprise steps (A) to (D) but from a basic security standpoint the number of nodes and the number of node operators is a basic one. 

Mind figuring out a workflow to keep us updated and informed on this front? I do believe there is general confusion about what it is to be expected and what will happen in the coming months. 

There are other threads that dive into the weeds on which hardware spec to choose and I feel like most people don't see the bigger zoomed out picture right now.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-09-01 19:54:55 UTC | #112

And if we could get some analysis on node shuffling/rotation and get that officially into the roadmap if the benefits are clear, that would be great too.

-------------------------

ritvick | 2022-09-01 20:44:27 UTC | #113

I see in the subpost it is mentioned that there is a way to put a new node to the network
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/draft-motion-proposal-new-hardware-specification-and-remuneration-for-ic-nodes/14202/13?u=ritvick

Can someone clearly clarify this: -
1. Is it still possible to become a NP and provide node to network and earn rewards? without steps A to D (mentioned in this thread ) being completed ?
2. If not then is everybody waiting for A to D to be completed, and this form https://internet-computer.typeform.com/to/IWl3iClx?typeform-source=www.dfinitycommunity.com to be updated with link to be pointed with new instructions **before any new node is added to the network**?

[/quote]

It is (and will always be) _possible_ to become a new NP, but there are a few practical obstacles at the moment. One is the hardware spec; as stated by @Luis above we are working on a new (updated and less restrictive) hardware spec; the old hardware spec has been very restrictive and it may not be straightforward to get new hardware satisfying it. (I'll try to come back with more details on the new spec.) Another (potential) obstacle is that the [onboarding process](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding) is quite technical at the moment and the tooling needs improvement.

The – technically – essential parts of the deliverables (reproducible builds, software distribution for deployment) have been completed. Practically, another dependency is then the new node hardware spec.

esquivada | 2022-09-06 15:08:00 UTC | #115

If we want IC to be the L1 of the Internet, you must work hard on it and facilitate access, we need a good balance between descentr & safe of the chain

-------------------------

ritvick | 2022-09-07 01:34:11 UTC | #117

Okay I see your point.
Now since we agree that any one following the wiki can spin up the node. I have few questions based on few assumptions
Assumption:

1. Lot of Votes are follower votes, so I understand if Dfinity foundation / ICA/ (whoever has majority of following ) votes then the proposal is expected.
2. Hosting a node requires few proposals, new NP proposal, New DC proposal, and few more.

Question:

1. If anyone submits the (“Register a New NP proposal” and other proposals) to add a node to network, on what grounds Dfinity foundation / ICA/ (whoever has majority of following ) approves or rejects it ?
2. I see a lot of nodes are sitting in Awaiting subnet status. And as per my understanding one does not get rewarded unless the node is in a subnet. What is the criteria to get into a subnet ( either old or a new one) ? . Are subnets created automatically or manually for now?

The whole point of asking these questions is though we wait for this thread to complete there are people who want to invest and become node provider, and it comes with a hefty cost.

Request: Whoever answers this post, please try to objectively answer the bullet points and all the questions if possible. I am sure me and community will have followup questions on this.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-09-07 05:03:03 UTC | #118

Yes, personally I would like to see this happen as well. I'm willing to invest in being an NP if it becomes available for individuals to host at their residences. This was a major hope of mine for the future. I really like the idea of investing in becoming an NP if the rewards are substantial enough to make it worth while. I also would like to help decentralization in any way I can. 

Please keep us (the community) updated!

[/quote]

The main purpose of having the registration go through the proposal flow is the _validation of the information_. That is, to add a new NP, the NNS needs to validate the identity of the node provider. The documentation necessary may differ from case to case. As this is the first time we'll be adding entirely new node providers post-launch, this probably also deserves some discussion on the forum.

While your assumption 1. is correct, which is that at this moment DFINITY and ICA direct the largest chunk of voting power on the relevant topics, we will try our best to collaborate with the community on the decision.

[/quote]

Here we need to differentiate between (a) the current implementation and (b) the intended future mechanism. At this moment, the rewards that are paid out are determined exclusively by the "rewardable nodes" setting in the IC's registry. That is, the information whether or not the nodes are in a subnet is not yet used for the reward computation; the "rewardable nodes" data structure is the source of truth. That data structure is changed via a proposal to the governance system, which is the last step in the NP onboarding flow.

At the moment, subnets are created and nodes are added/removed from subnets based on proposals, most of which are today generated by DFINITY's team. Behind the scenes, the team uses tooling that maximizes decentralization based on objective criteria. In the future, we expect to move that code into the NNS so that all decisions on node assignment are performed programmatically by the governance system.

In the future, the remuneration will take more data such as actual subnet membership and node uptime/downtime into account, so the accounting will be a lot more precise.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-10-20 15:13:30 UTC | #120

Dear community, this is Sven Fischer from DFINITY, part of the Release Management team.

As we are moving into the fourth quarter we would like to give an update on the status of the Node Decentralization activities. To recap, the onboarding of new Node Providers (NPs) was halted due to reprioritization of other activities, amongst others, the Bitcoin Integration. However, other node decentralization activities, like upgrading of existing nodes, and testing of new hardware specifications, have progressed in the meantime.

As of the start of Q4, the status of our decentralization efforts is as follows:

* The upgrading of existing nodes to is in progress and continues until the end of 2022. Storage upgrade will be included in this to accommodate potential growth in storage requirements of the IC network.
* In Q4, we will start onboarding the first new Node Providers. Focus will be on adding nodes of new NPs to the NNS subnet in order to extend our degree of decentralization of the NNS. Furthermore, part of the new nodes will be used to increase the security of the ECDSA subnet used for Bitcoin integration.
* The new NPs will be onboarded using the new hardware specification ([Gen2 replica node hardware specification](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_provider_hardware#Gen_2)), while we are completing the final tests of the hardware in parallel, specifically on the support of SEV-SNP
* We will start in Q4 with onboarding of 6 new NPs.
* A subset of these new NPs will be asked to onboard independently based on the currently available NP onboarding runbooks ([Node Provider Onboarding](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding)), in order to show the community that NPs can onboard without intervention or support from the foundation. Technically it is already possible for a NP to onboard, but there are technical practicalities as stated in the above thread that inhibit this, and we want to make the onboarding process a smooth and efficient process.
* Self-declaration: While the new onboarding process provides more independence to NPs, it brings the question how the community can judge which NP proposals to adopt and which ones to reject. The team is preparing a self-declaration template. Through an upcoming NNS motion proposal, we propose to establish this self-declaration as a means for NPs to provide more information to the NNS community, enabling an informed vote on whether to adopt a new NP.
* For the new NPs being onboarded we will follow the existing remuneration schema. That is, rewards are determined exclusively by the “rewardable nodes” setting in the IC’s registry. This might change in the future as the team is looking into taking into account more precise metrics such as node uptime and downtime (see also the previous thread response on Remuneration).

The DFINITY Foundation is currently working together with the community and existing NPs for the above activities. There is a large backlog of NP requests so we expect the decentralization to accelerate over the first two quarters of the next year, with the introduction of runbooks for independent onboarding by new NPs.

Q4 2022

* (A) Continued work on upgrading existing nodes.
* (B) Onboarding of 6 new NPs, with a subset following runbooks for autonomous node deployment. Deployment will be based on the next generation HW configuration that is currently in test.
* (C) Testing of next generation HW for different HW vendors.

Q1 2023

* (C) Testing of next generation HW for different HW vendors.
* (D) Start of autonomous node deployment for new NPs.

Q2/Q3 2023

* (E) NNS-driven DC allocation: The NNS-controlled DC allocation mechanism will be introduced and control all future node additions. With this step and a new node hardware an accelerated network growth is unleashed.
* (F) NP onboarding using NNS Front-end dapp instead of CLI tooling.

Of course, based on community feedback or technical obstacles that we might encounter, the plan might be adjusted. We will continue to update you through the forum on the status of these activities.

How are those selected? Is it on a first come first served base from the backlog? If so, is there a way to find out what place one has on the waitlist?

-------------------------

shayaaa | 2022-09-30 20:47:57 UTC | #122

We seem to have about ~74 existing NP's, have the current NP been "fully on boarded" with most of their nodes being operational? Looking at the IC Dashboard there seems to be a lot of gaps. Do you know what could be holding that up? 

Am I also correct in understanding that new NP's will have same rewards as the first round? Although NP rewards are a smaller factor in overall inflation rate, that seems less than ideal.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-10-03 19:36:25 UTC | #123

Thanks @cryptoschindler, this is a very good question. The team is still discussing on this, but it will most likely take into account different aspects, as we need to take into account decentralization metrics per city, country, region and continent; so it will not only be on first come, first serve basis. As soon as I have more information, I will make sure to update the community in this thread.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-03 19:42:03 UTC | #124

Real question is how will they be selected once NNS is responsible for node onboarding

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-10-03 19:46:55 UTC | #125

That is correct @Zane and we will definitely come back on this.

-------------------------

ritvick | 2022-10-11 23:15:11 UTC | #126

All this new ob-boarding process looks okay. But to be frank, when does one buy the hardware? Buying the hardware takes a lead time of up to 6 months.
So my questions are:
1. 
Whoever wants to become an NP, shall they apply first to become NP? Reach step IX https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding#IX._Create_a_node_operator_record
Because till then it's all a manual approval process and no one would want to buy such expensive hardware without knowing with 100% certainty what it will take for them to reach that step.
2. Also I understand a Node is not rewarded unless it is in a subnet. Even when a node is onboarded how does the process looks like to get into a subnet? No one would want to have a node onboarded and just pay bills without getting rewarded. 

Let's try to bring more clarity to the community on this.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-10-27 18:43:33 UTC | #127

Thanks @ritvick for your questions. These are actually very relevant, and the reason for not responding earlier is that we are discussing these questions internally. We are working on clear guidance and proposals in this area that we will share with the community shortly. Thanks again for bringing this up.

SvenF | 2022-11-07 19:19:51 UTC | #128

**Update November - Node Decentralization**

Following up on the roadmap that we posted four weeks ago, I would like to give an update of the decentralization activities since then. Before going into the details, let’s look at the network topology as of today versus last year. A lot of progress has been made with respect to decentralization so far. The table below shows that overall decentralization has increased over the last three quarters on every metric, with the exception of the number of Node Providers (NPs) and Geographies, which is the reason our target for the next year will be to have new Node Providers onboard, in particular in new Geographies.

![|624x283](upload://6VSB7JpOUzYzFrtuaql9lE4UX0z.jpeg)

**Storage increase of existing replica nodes**

To recap, Node Providers are currently upgrading their existing configuration, allowing these Node Providers to independently manage their nodes, while at the same time increasing the storage capacity of the nodes from 3.2 TB to 32 TB. This upgrade is in full progress, with Asia nodes being 100% completed, European nodes 94 % (1 Node Provider left) and US nodes 44% completed (9 Node Providers left). We expect the upgrade of existing Node Providers to be fully completed by the end of the year.

When the upgrade of existing Node Providers is completed, the Dfinity team that is consulting these Node Providers can start to focus on the autonomous onboarding process for new Node Providers.

**Testing of 2nd Generation Hardware**

The minimum requirements for the next generation of replica node hardware (Gen2HW) have been [published on the Internet Computer wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_provider_hardware#Gen_2), as well as three specific configurations of HW that have been validated by the Dfinity team. Validation of other HW specifications is in progress, and for discussion please refer to the separate Forum post [New Hardware Specification](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/draft-motion-proposal-new-hardware-specification-and-remuneration-for-ic-nodes/14202/28).

**Testing of the fully autonomous NP onboarding process**

The new NP onboarding process consists of two parts, covered by two separate runbooks: the onboarding of a new Data Center (DC) and the registration and acceptance as a new Node Provider by the NNS. The latter runbook was already available on the [wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding). The DC runbook is completed as well, and is currently being verified internally. The next step will be to test both the NP registration runbook and the DC setup in combination with Gen2HW. A brave potential new NP has agreed to test this process in November and December. The progress of these tests will mainly be determined by the lead time for procuring specific Gen2HW.

**Remuneration**

Cycle pricing and node provider rewards (remuneration) require refinement as the network grows. More concretely, we propose the following changes with respect to node provider rewards:

* Today’s Genesis remuneration model: In early 2021, NPs had to commit to a not-yet-launched network. To compensate for the risk taken, the original genesis remuneration model includes significant profit margins. This model does not cover all of the storage extensions described above, so the foundation has been covering a portion of those costs, while the storage was not benefitting the network.

* Interim Gen2HW-ready remuneration model: While a more general remuneration overhaul is required and needs to be discussed mid-term (see next bullet point), an interim update is required as the storage upgrade comes to a completion and NPs using Gen2HW are onboarded. We propose the remuneration to be take into account two factors. First, HW costs have risen and need to be compensated. However, having a running IC network reduces the risk of entry for new NPs, hence a lower risk premium is being included in the reward. Taking into account these above factors, the interim remuneration is lower than the Genesys remuneration model. The wiki page ([Node Provider Remuneration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration)) shows the draft of the interim remuneration model that we propose to use. It is based on currently available hardware prices and average rates for ICP and XDR. As shown from the table, the premium multiplier for remuneration will lower from 2.5 to 1.9 to take into account the reduced risk premium for joining the IC network. We look forward to your feedback in this forum thread, plan to incorporate it into the interim remuneration model and then submit the respective proposal to the NNS.

* Future remuneration model: We acknowledge that the interim remuneration update does not address all open questions such as how to incentivize decentralization through an adaptive remuneration. A more general update needs careful preparation and a thorough discussion with the community. We plan to start that discussion during the next few weeks.

**Node provider self-declaration**

As already [asked by Jordan Last](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/4?u=samuelburri) about a year ago, the autonomous NP onboarding process requires incentives for NPs and node operators to act in the interest of the IC. Moreover, the community needs sufficient information in order to be able to decide whether to adopt or reject a new NP. As [sketched by Dom on Medium](https://medium.com/dfinity/lets-grow-the-internet-computer-network-why-and-how-and-general-updates-1c8d0770a299), we plan to discuss and propose a self-declaration for NPs. We will present that in a separate thread shortly. Stay tuned.

**Way forward for onboarding**

With the runbooks tested and with a proposal for interim remuneration, we can start onboarding new node providers in a controlled way. Currently, the onboarding process requires sound technical knowledge, which is something we are aiming to reduce in the coming weeks and months. The steps to follow are roughly as follows:

* NP to prepare self-declaration (separate thread to follow shortly)
* NNS registration through proposals (see [Wiki instructions](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding) including all prerequisites)
  * Register as an NP (including pointer to self-registration)
  * Create a new data center record (if that does not exist already)
  * Create a node operator record (if that does not exist already)
* NP orders hardware (see [verified 2nd gen replica node configurations on the wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_provider_hardware#Gen_2))
* NP/node operator setup DC, install nodes, set up the reward configuration and have them join the network.

Lead time for ordering hardware can be up to several weeks or even months, thus the above process will take time. Most of the work is with the node providers: preparing documents for self-declaration, submitting proposals, purchasing hardware, setting up the nodes, etc. As outlined in earlier posts, we plan to provide a better user experience for some of these activities, especially for submitting proposals and changing the NP profile. For now, however, NPs should be comfortably working with a console.

As explained in the introduction of this post and also motivated in the Medium article [Let’s Grow the Internet Computer Network](https://medium.com/dfinity/lets-grow-the-internet-computer-network-why-and-how-and-general-updates-1c8d0770a299), the IC network needs to grow. In particular, the network needs

* more, i.e. new, node providers and
* nodes in underrepresented geographies, such as Asia, Australia, and Africa in order to improve decentralization.

**Call for action**

In summary, we encourage

* new node providers
* who are technically savvy and not afraid to be among the first to run the autonomous onboarding process
* and plan to contribute nodes in underrepresented geographies

to start reviewing the hardware specifications, to familiarize themselves with the runbooks, and to stay tuned for the upcoming self-declaration discussion.

We propose to start with small batches of node machines (e.g. 5 per new node provider and location). As the process matures based on the feedback of these early adopters, we expect the numbers to grow more rapidly.

We look forward to feedback from the community, especially from potential future node providers.

Mr_Burkes | 2022-11-09 20:57:53 UTC | #129

QQ: What defenses does the network have against bad node providers?

What if we onboard a bad node provider who only violates the protocol? How will people on the NNS know if a node is bad? Are node rewards slashed?

-------------------------

plasmex | 2022-11-12 17:58:59 UTC | #130

From what I've gathered there is an SLA as a deterrent for downtime.

As far as validating node specs beyond simply being hard down, not completely sure.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-11-12 19:09:04 UTC | #131

Thank you for sharing the plan.

A few questions:
1. The WIP Gen2 renumeration [model](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) assumes an annual inflation rate of 10% when estimating operating expenses over the next 4 years. That seems overly pessimistic. According to the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2022/10/11/world-economic-outlook-october-2022), global inflation will be 8.8% in 2022 but decline to 6.5% in 2023 and to 4.1% in 2024. Also, developed countries typically experience less inflation than developing countries; I wonder if a more fine-grained inflation model makes sense here.

2. On the topic of OpEx, I am curious why Asia OpEx is nearly twice USA OpEx. The [wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) says those estimates are based on numbers shared by current NPs. Wouldn't NPs have an incentive to inflate those numbers to receive larger rewards? What checks and balances do we have to prevent NPs from lying? Could the NNS leverage the new HTTPS outcall feature to query external sources without relying solely on NP claims?

3. It is difficult for a layman like myself to assess whether a 90% profit margin is appropriate or not. How does this compare with other blockchains, e.g. validators on Ethereum? How does this compare with cloud providers? Should the margin be automatically adjusted based on some formula in the future?

4. Somewhat unrelated, but this wiki [page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Roles_of_the_ICP_utility_token) says "Renumeration of node operators" instead of "Renumeration of node providers". I'm assuming that is a typo.

Thank you!

-------------------------

Mr_Burkes | 2022-11-13 19:28:23 UTC | #132

I'm bumping this because this is an important question. How can we ever add non-Dfinity-approved nodes if we don't have a guarantee of protocol disincentives?

@Mr_Burkes @plasmex these are very important questions indeed. we can automatically check some elements in advance (see also this other forum post: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-for-node-provider-self-declaration/16501) but there is of course still to potential for violating the protocol. There are two features we are discussing and preparing internally, work in progress: an automated reward system in the NNS that includes penalty for policy violation, and observability/monitoring of NP performance. Both are on the roadmap and being worked on.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-11-14 19:29:33 UTC | #135

Hi @jzxchiang thanks for the detailed feedback. To respond to each of your items

1. correct, we have taken a conservative estimate, taking into account that we want to stimulate NPs in new geographies to join. 

1. Yes there would be incentive to inflate the numbers but we have a good view on the operating expenses based on the existing NPs and the operation of the Dfinity nodes. And yes, node provider performance can to some extend be monitored automatically as well; this is a feature we are planning to implement in the future as well.

1. it is very difficult to compare with other blockchains as the business model for validators and miners is completely different. For the IC, a NP does not get rewards for number of transactions run on a node or subnet, but for performance/availability of the node. The intention indeed is to have the reward system automated inside the NNS and be updated automatically. To be continued and posted in the forum once we have suggestions for this.

1. Yes will correct this.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-11-14 21:46:49 UTC | #137

To add, the above are future features we are planning to add. Note that in the current implementation, we need consensus of at least 2/3 of the nodes in a subnet to continue. A node that is deviating is not removed automatically and collects rewards, but it should be eventually removed.

@Mr_Burkes I want to escalate this point by @SvenF  because it directly addresses your question about misbehaving nodes, and I am afraid it may be buried among the comments.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-11-16 05:59:15 UTC | #139

Thanks for the response. Regarding (1), I wonder if the profit margin should be enough to incentivize NPs. I'm not sure the inflation rate is a parameter that should be tuned for anything other than accuracy based on official projections.

-------------------------

Mr_Burkes | 2022-11-21 21:48:06 UTC | #140

What does eventually removed mean?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-11-28 16:42:27 UTC | #142

@Mr_Burkes , the nodes on every subnet are monitored, and the status of each node is visible in the public dashboard (e.g. [NNS subnet status](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe)). If a node is down or unhealthy, it is eventually swapped for another, healthy node. This process is done through an NNS proposal, as you can also find in the dashboard under governance (see here an example of a  proposal for a node replacement: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/93959) that the community votes upon and is eventually executed.

-------------------------

shayaaa | 2022-12-07 01:31:23 UTC | #143

@SvenF I think the rewards overall are too generous and reward rate for Gen 2 are too close to Gen 1. ICP should have plenty of willing NP's to come in at a rate under ~1.9x (proposed Gen 2 USA renumeration) regardless of geography. I don't think there will be significant or any drop off from Gen-2 NP interest if we reduce to proposed renumeration to something more reasonable, perhaps ~1.5x.

-------------------------

SS88 | 2022-12-18 15:59:27 UTC | #144

I don't know why the process to on-board a new node must be so convoluted and difficult. This seems to me to be in contradiction to the claim that "The IC is designed for anyone to be able to become a node provider (NP)."

I am an individual with the resources to invest immediately in one or a few nodes to start with, and in at least two geographical regions (datacentres in cities not yet served/in the list) and I would have hoped to expand the operation in the future, but the process seems impossible. For example, elsewhere it is recommended that the proposal contains details of my github (or similar) page and my business website. Well:
- I do not have a github page because I am not a programmer (but I do have sufficient experience to run a node);
- I have not formed a legal entity to own and run the nodes, and therefore do not have a business registration or business website. I would want to do this (spend time and money on creating the business structure) after having my proposal approved.
So I am supposed to stake x ICP for the slim chance of the proposal being approved in the circumstances described? Obviously it (the minimum stake which appears to be ICP 10.00) is not a lot of money right now, but it seems almost certain that I would be simply throwing that money away.

I wanted to approach this in good faith and be rewarded for my non-statistically-deviating node(s), but the barriers are too high. I suppose I have to look at opportunities elsewhere, which is a shame, as I can see that IC has amazing potential and it is disappointing that it seems I cannot contribute to its future in one of the few ways I can. The rules/processes, it seems to me, aren't doing much for IC's resilience/decentralisation. Disappointing!

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-18 13:50:33 UTC | #145

@SvenF would you consider simplifying the rules to help out this fine gentleman / lady? Onboarding new NPs should be straightforward.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-12-19 20:58:10 UTC | #146

Hi @SS88  and @dfisher, thanks for the feedback and agree that the onboarding process and node setup needs to be straightforward!

The node setup is still quite tech-savy and it will take some time in order for the setup to be done without any technical knowledge, but that is definitely something for the long term roadmap. 

But the onboarding process can of course be further simplified to include non business entities. That's why the proposal for the onboarding process was posted on the Forum. Eventually, it should of course be for the community to decide what would be the onboarding rules for a new NP. For a person that is not a business entity, the community should have some way to identify the authenticity of the person. Since that person does not have a github account or chamber of commerce number, some other document or way of identification might be required. Any suggestions is very much welcome and I am happy to pick this up together with you.

SvenF and dfisher, thanks for your replies.

I am an IC beginner, but I have read the articles about nodes meeting the correct specification and so on and I don't really understand why it is a concern; after all, if the node is not meeting the required distribution then why not just slash it? I accept that I might be missing some technical or theoretical understanding here and don't spend time replying as this is more rhetorical but I have talked to others who have similar questions.

Also, I have read in other places comments like:
"You need Dfinity's permission to run a node!"
"It's not decentralised, Dfinity runs the network!"
"It's highly centralised, there are only 8 node providers!"
"It's a scam because [some variation of the above, or comment about early investors]!"
etc.
and I think that this difficulty of adding a node really does contribute to this bad press. Therefore I do hope that a great reassessment and simplification of the process can be made because, now, people like me who have good intentions are shut out.

At the moment, the barriers are too high for me (and I understand that sufficient nodes are lined up going into 2023 anyway), so I am going to sit this out until the process is a bit easier.

Thanks again for the quick replies.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-12-22 21:04:24 UTC | #149

Thanks @SS88, completely agree with your observations getting a node up should be much simpler and the team is working hard on this, as well as to get it further decentralised. As you can see from previous updates there has been progress to decentralise the node infrastructure, and this will be focus for 2023 as well. If you are still up for it now, I am happy to help you out of course. In the meantime I will continue to post updates on how we are doing with the decentralisation.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-12-23 13:46:58 UTC | #150

Hi @shayaaa, thanks for this observation! We have looked at the rates and also had feedback from some smaller (potential new) Node Providers. For smaller Node Providers, the remuneration might be on the low side even with a multiplier as their Opex expenses (ISP and data center costs) are relatively high for them with only a few nodes. Whereas this is not the case for Node Providers with a large number of nodes. This is something that might need to be taken into account (and voted of course by the community) for the future.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-23 21:26:13 UTC | #151

Due to the community decentralization benefits of having more node providers instead of always larger node providers, I think it makes sense to offer a discount to smaller node providers to offset the centralization incentive from economies of scale - not a complete offset, of course, but at least somewhat.

-------------------------

shayaaa | 2023-01-09 22:35:50 UTC | #152

@SvenF I appreciate the reply and it made me think of something... I've heard that on Solana you need about $2MM to run a profitable validator yet they are able to have “smaller wallet” people join validators because of their design - - other PoS chains are able to do similar things with pooling resources. I know this isn’t exactly possible on ICP but would there be a possibility for something like “Parent NP's" that establish the nodes to the network and then “decentralize” themselves by selling interests in their node? If there is enough community interest, could something like a "NodeDAO" that pools money together and operates nodes as a community be another possibility?

-------------------------

Sabr | 2023-01-09 23:06:19 UTC | #153

[/quote]

What purpose would that really serve to "decentralize" anything? Everyone has heard of the "$5 wrench attack" to steal someone's crypto by physical threat or force. For NPs, I would call a similar attack on decentralization the "5 cent paper attack". If a sniveling little bureaucrat from one of a dozen three-letter U.S. agencies threatened to slap economic sanctions, no-fly-list sanctions, terror watch list sanctions, indefinite detention without trial, etc. on a node provider (use your imagination for more examples based on prior U.S. precedents), would all those "decentralized" nodes of his get shut down from that one piece of paper too? My guess is yes, they would.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-01-10 13:10:23 UTC | #154

There are two things to consider. 

1. Who controls the nodes and signs the lease agreement with the data center. This is what is important for decentralization. 

2. Who benefits from the NP rewards. 

It doesn’t matter if 10,1000, or 10,000 people own the NP rewards if you have one person that controls it. 

So yeah, you can decentralize ownership but ultimately somebody needs to control the machines in the data center which is all that matters from a security standpoint.

-------------------------

shayaaa | 2023-01-25 18:10:44 UTC | #155

@dfisher Would there be any possibility for the SNS launch a "DAO" that controls a node(s)? Could the control of the node somehow be under the control of the DAO itself so all stakeholders can make decisions? (sorry I'm not very technical so forgive me if these ideas are dumb/not possible)

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-01-25 18:57:20 UTC | #156

No that's not possible. The SNS is great for things that exclusively live online like a website. 

If it interacts with the real world then the SNS is not great. In this case we have physical servers a person controls, someone needs to sign a lease with a data center, enter the data center, access the servers etc etc. An indiviudal is going to control this. It cannot be handed over to the SNS for control.

-------------------------

shayaaa | 2023-01-25 19:14:27 UTC | #157

@dfisher Understood, thank you

SvenF | 2023-02-17 12:11:25 UTC | #158

Dear all, after posting the remuneration proposal for new node providers with Gen2 Hardware in December, we have received some valuable suggestions for further improvement of the remuneration model. The feedback was both from the community in this forum thread as well as from existing and potential future node providers. Main suggestions for the remuneration proposal were:

1. How can smaller entities/node providers be incentivized to join as a node provider?

2. How can we differentiate between incentivizing node providers in different regions, for different numbers of nodes?

Based on these suggestions, we have spent the last weeks working out an updated remuneration model for Gen2, which for clarity we will call V2 remuneration and is described [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration). The V2 remuneration model on a high level covers the following:

1. Higher rewards for the first nodes of a new NP in order to attract more NPs in an effort to improve ownership decentralization.

2. More refined rewards for nodes in new geographies, like South America, Africa, Asia and Australia, to stimulate further geographical decentralization.

With this updated remuneration model, it is much more interesting for potential new Node Providers to join with a small number of nodes. But it remains interesting for Node Providers who want to set up a larger number of nodes in a new country or region, to join as well. The node reward model is parametrized by:

1. **Geography multiplier:** This multiplier will be lower, namely 2, for regions with many nodes (e.g. Europe and North America), and higher, namely 3, for regions where there are currently limited nodes present (such as Africa and South America)

2. **Reduction coefficient (r)**: The node reward of the n-th node of a Node Provider is multiplied by r ^ (n-1). The reduction coefficient r is dependent on the geography of the Node Provider. As a result, the first nodes of a Node Provider gets attractive rewards but it is increasingly less attractive to add additional nodes.

The detailed formulas and reward amounts can be found on the[ internet computer wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration).

Note that the V2 remuneration proposal only applies for a limited period of time in which the team is working on a more elaborate and automated remuneration solution in the NNS, the V3 remuneration. This future remuneration will be based on a reduction coefficient formula that applies a combination of NP, Country, Data Center and city. In addition, the future remuneration model will include penalties in case nodes should be unavailable.

Please continue to share any additional thoughts and suggestions on this remuneration model in this Forum thread.

I will update in this thread as well once the corresponding NNS proposal is live for voting.

[/quote]
I understand the value of distribution among Countries for the sake of having a diversity of political/governmental systems.

Might a more permanent and automated solution, however, instead incentivise geographical distribution based simply upon remoteness from other NPs/data centers? 

This would
- Avoid having the IC judge political disputes regarding land ownership (Ukraine, Liberland, Taiwan, etc)
- Avoid the need to update remuneration based upon changing Country borders (wars, land sales, new claims)
- Automate and encourage geographical distribution amongst states/provinces/territories
- Incentivise node construction on unclaimed lands (islands, Antarctica, the moon)
- Ensure security against nuclear, EMP, and other large or massive scale destruction events

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-02-17 12:21:32 UTC | #160

Hi @Jonathan, that's actually an interesting idea that could be implemented next to country or geography., i.e. a solution that takes both into account.

-------------------------

Samer | 2023-02-17 15:13:03 UTC | #161

Nodes on the moon anyone? I'm in! 😂

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2023-02-17 22:11:16 UTC | #162

Below is a formula from ChatGPT to calculate a value (V) for the spatial remoteness of a given node (N). The idea is based on Newton's inverse square law, except... well, inverted. Essentially, nodes take the place of mass.

It assumes that the physical locations of all nodes can be queried as a set of Cartesian coordinates. Manipulating *k* and *p* can potentially produce an infinitely scalable factor for geographical/spatial value, adding heavy incentives for e.g. a lunar or Martian node 😉 (How to treat of latency in exotic locations is another matter.) The fact that some potential nodes on ships, satellites, or celestial bodies would be in motion would need to be addressesed, perhaps by taking an average of *d* over time.

NB this formula uses Euclidean distances.

--------

To define a value V that increases as the distance of an object N from all other objects of its type increases in Cartesian coordinates, we can use the following formula:

V = 1 / (k + ∑i=1 to n d(N, Ni)^p)

where,

V is the value that increases as the distance of object N from all other objects of its type increases.
k is a constant that ensures V is non-zero and can be adjusted to change the rate at which V increases with distance.
n is the total number of objects of the same type as N.
d(N, Ni) is the Euclidean distance between object N and object i, where i is any other object of the same type as N.
p is an exponent that determines how quickly the value of V increases as the distance between the objects increases.
The formula computes the sum of the distances between object N and all other objects of the same type, with the sum raised to the power of the exponent p. The value of V is then obtained by taking the reciprocal of this sum, adding k to it to ensure that V is non-zero, and then taking the reciprocal again. As the distance between object N and any other object of the same type increases, the value of V increases. The exponent p determines how quickly the value of V increases with distance. A larger value of p means that V increases more quickly as the distance between objects increases. Conversely, a smaller value of p means that V increases more slowly with distance.

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2023-02-17 23:53:02 UTC | #163

Another option would be to begin at *N* and take an expanding radius outward. For each *Ni* within a given radius *r*, node rewards are reduced accordingly. This would allow for some rewards to be maintained when a node is only somewhat lonely, rather than fully isolated.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-02-26 04:45:17 UTC | #164

Can you please tell me which form I should use to apply for Node provider? I remember that ICA used to have an application form, but I am not sure if it exists now. Also, are there any eligibility requirements to apply?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-02-27 18:55:45 UTC | #165

Hi @hokosugi, great to hear you are interested in becoming a Node Provider! 

In order to become a Node Provider, you need to prepare the Node Provider self-declaration (see https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Self-declaration) and then submit a NNS proposal to become a Node Provider as described on Node Provide onboarding wiki page (https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Onboarding). I suggest to first prepare the Self-declaration form, and then send it in a direct message to me so it can be uploaded on the internet computer wiki. I will then also explain the steps to submit the NNS proposal.

Hello Sven Fischer
I want to build a node in HongKong, do we have to use 10Gbps professional bandwidth? What advice can you give me! Thanks! ! Where else can I reach you other than the forum?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-03-03 11:57:34 UTC | #169

Hi @lyjmry, thanks for the question! The bandwidth depends on how many nodes you want to set up. The average bandwidth requirement is 300mpbs. I am happy to set up a quick call for any questions you, will reach out to you with a direct message,
Best, Sven

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2023-03-03 15:27:55 UTC | #170


what are the standards for accurately computing cost(g)? 

is any direct labor included in that? overhead? legal costs to defend your node operations if a government, corporation, or data center orders some kind of shut down of your node?

"The rewards are furthermore dependent on estimated capital and operational expenses that vary based on geographies. A table with the concrete numbers follows below."

how are you getting a "concrete figure" if the sentence before that explicitly states that the basis for the figures are some estimates you are making?

are you using GAAP for the United States and IFS for the ROW?  

is there a central entity auditing the accounting records (for all node providers) that the DFINITY Foundation will contract,  or is that going to vary by node providers and be their responsibility? will those costs be included in the appropriate parameter? — for the results of the audit, will the firm issuing a qualified statement suffice, or will the standards for that be the same as if the node provider had publicly traded equity in the country in which it is operating? and if a node provider isn't able to find or contract with an accounting firm that understands cryptocurrency well enough to conduct the audit?

will a record of these audits be made publicly available? will you require node providers to somehow confirm that they are proficient with the guidelines for recording these expenses in the first place? (the source documents for transactions, and so on)

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-03-04 23:46:44 UTC | #171

I am seriously considering becoming a node provider.

Two question:

> NP/node operator setup DC, install nodes, set up the reward configuration and have them join the network.

A node provider would be setting up hardware in a Data Center somewhere, right?
When I check the dashboard, most Data Centers have 1 node provider and fewer than 2 (e.g. INAP and Flexential). Does this mean that there are few Data Centers where node providers will set up new nodes and we have to wait until a new Data Center is opened or build a Data Center by our own?

> who are technically savvy and not afraid to be among the first to run the autonomous onboarding process

I am willing to do it, but I have few skills and a friend will be setting it up, he is knowledgeable but not a specialist. What level of skill is required? Also, are there any instances where the installation and setup of nodes was not completed in the end with the current support system?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-03-06 15:22:14 UTC | #172

Hi @MisterSignal, thanks for your questions. The costs are calculated based on the capex and opex expenses for acquiring and runinng the nodes. Overhead is included (for remote hands), but not the legal costs.

Since the IC is a decentralized network there is no contract between NPs, DCs and the foundation, nor any central auditing entity. However, it is important that the community can verify the identity and credentials of both the Node Provider as well as the DC. For now, the NP needs to submit a self-declaration form that is posted on the internet computer wiki so publicly visible. Happy to hear if you have any recommendations for verification of NPs and DCs in a decentralized network.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-03-06 15:29:41 UTC | #173

Hi @hokosugi, good to hear from you again. 

Different Node Provider can be in the same DC location, so you are not restricted to setting up your own DC. However, if multiple NPs set up their nodes in the same DC this will not help the decentralization metrics for the IC (the Nakamoto coefficients) as you want to have all nodes in a subnet preferably to be in different DCs. So this is something to take into account when selecting a DC for your nodes. 

You require some technical expertise, in particular SRE knowledge and networking knowledge, to set up the nodes. But with the current instructions on the wiki., so far all NPs have been able to set up their nodes, so there are no cases where somebody was not able to complete this.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-03-09 21:25:16 UTC | #174

Thanks for the reply.
Is it possible to select Data Center as Node provider? For example, I live in Japan, but if I want to install a node in a Data Center in Tokyo, will I have to discuss this with the Data Center? Also, is the scope of responsibility between Data Center and Node Provider clarified? For example, who is responsible for the network environment of the DC, such as routers, cables, etc.?

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-03-10 08:33:24 UTC | #175

Hi @hokosugi, yes this is absolutely possible. The Node Provider is the investor and owner of the nodes (servers), and is the only one who has access to them and is repsonsible for the availability of the nodes. The Data Center is the location where the nodes are hosted, and you as Node Provider will typically have a monthly/yearly contract with a Data Center for rackspace, networking and bandwidth. 

Note that the IC already has nodes in Tokyo, so from a perspective of decentralization it will be important to have new Node Providers in new Data Centers and new countries. This is something the community will look at when voting on new Node Provider Proposals.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-11 01:38:59 UTC | #176

Hi @SvenF, the new dashboard shows the following:

- Total Nodes: 1,235
- Nodes in Subnets: 549

Could you please explain the difference? What does it mean if there’s a node but it’s not in a subnet?

-------------------------

Dylan | 2023-03-11 18:22:06 UTC | #177

[quote="dfisher, post:176, topic:9170"]
* Total Nodes: 1,235
* Nodes in Subnets: 549
[/quote]

Total Nodes is the total number of rewardable nodes. Nodes in subnets is the total number of nodes that are active or offline in all subnets.

Here is a post from @bjoern that sheds light on why these numbers are different:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/node-compensation-and-runaway-massive-inflation/12609/32?u=dylan

Denis | 2023-03-11 19:03:15 UTC | #178

This from the Messari report of May 2021 seems relevant:
"The Foundation expects the number of IC data center and node operators to gradually grow post-launch to support the network’s ecosystem of apps (see below for details). The team targets for the network to reach 123 data centers running 4,300 nodes by the end of 2021." Bootstrapping indeed.

-------------------------

Shuai | 2023-04-08 10:01:05 UTC | #179

Hi. @SvenF I would like to apply to become a node provider, but I have some questions. 

1. If I want to add a new data centre through NNS, will there be strict criteria to limit the data center, such as tier3, soc2, and so on？
2. As far as I can see, there are some new node providers that still don't have any node shown in the ic dashboard. So, is it possible to register as a node provider before the data center and machine has been identified?
3. When can the node provider start receiving revenue after the new node provider has prepared the data centre and machines? Previously it seemed that unassigned nodes were also rewardable. Is this still the case now for new node providers? Will Dfinity Team limit the rate of increase in the number of rewardable nodes deployed by new node providers?
4. Will Dfinity Team help new node providers to purchase servers and deploy nodes? Does the Dfinity Team provide one-to-one guidance to Node Providers after they have completed their NNS registration?

Thanks very much.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-04-14 07:49:01 UTC | #180

Hi @Shuai,
thanks for posting these questions, these are very relevant when considering to onboard as a Node Provider. To answer them:

1. the main requirement for a data center is that it's location can be verified by the community once you submit a data center proposal (the second step in the onboarding process). There are currently no requirements in terms of tier3, soc2 but this might change in the future depending on what the community suggested in terms of validation of data centers.

1. there are some node providers in the process of onboarding, These have submitted the NP proposal (which the community has voted upon) and are in the process of procuring the Gen2 hardware and setting up the nodes. Submitting the NP proposal first and getting it approved before ordering the servers looks to be the most straightforward.

1. nodes are rewarded for being available in a subnet or to join a subnet. So healthy nodes that are not in a subnet also get rewarded. It is for the community to decide on the limit that is being set on nodes per NP and per country, and this is also reflected in the current remuneration proposal that has been voted upon (within limited remuneration in regions and countries where there are already quite a lot of nodes, and a higher remuneration for setting up nodes in a new region).

1. the IC is a decentralized network so the NP onboarding, procurement of servers and proposal submissions will need to be done by the future NP itself. Of course, fellow Node Provider and Dfinity team can advise and support but the process itself needs to become fully dencentralized.

Hope this answers your questions,
Best, Sven

My concern is voting on the NNS when I see a Add node operator with a proposer I do not know and always seems to add a proposal in outside business hrs which is a red flag for me and I will always vote No.

Should new nodes be only allow during business hrs?

Nice work @kvic, turning my half-glib response into a world computer definition of "business hours".
Thumbs 👍. FWIW when working with Euro area businesses from Australia we schedule meetings around 5pm or 9pm to coincide with first half their work day. For America's it would be our morning. 
Also I agree with your concern about the lack of supporting information about node related proposals. More info and time for NNS voters to understand (even if mundane would be better

I have some questions about the requirements for a node provider.
 (I’m afraid these are novice ones, but willing to ask..)

(1) Public /28 IPv4 range and /64 IPv6 range 
Does this mean we need to subscribe to this number of global IPs per node with ISP? In other words, if there are five nodes in the data center, does this mean that 16x5=80 global IPv4 addresses are needed?
(2) Is there a minimum number of nodes per data center?

-------------------------

icarus | 2023-04-17 04:03:55 UTC | #186

Hi @hoosan 

The details of an answer to your question (1) can be found in the following wiki pages:
-  [IC-OS Installation Runbook](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/IC_OS_Installation_Runbook) 
- [Gen-2 Network Requirements](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Gen-2_Network_Requirements)
- [Gen2 Data Center runbook](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Gen-2_Data_Center_runbook) 

The last runbook is DFINITY-specific and
> illustrates how DFINITY manages a typical rack of IC nodes (an 'ICR').  It is published for the benefit of node providers to show one possible implementation of the ICR Gen2 networking requirements.

The most relevant excerpt from the latter page in the first section "Uplink configuration":

> 1. Management Port
>   * Assigned public IPv4 range (min /31): <mark>[FILL IN]</mark>
>   * Default GW address: <mark>[FILL IN]</mark>
>   ...
> 2. Production Port
>   * Assigned public IPv6 range (/64): <mark>[FILL IN]</mark>
>   * IPv6 Default GW address: <mark>[FILL IN]</mark>
>   * (optional) assigned public IPv4 range (min /29): <mark>[FILL IN]</mark>
>   * (optional) IPv4 Default GW address: <mark>[FILL IN]</mark>
>   ...

So as I undertand it, each IC replica node uses one IPv6 address (and an "optional" IPv4 address??) to communicate via ICP  with the NNS and the subnet it is assigned.  
See [Gen-2_Network_Requirements#ICR_LAN](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Gen-2_Network_Requirements#ICR_LAN) for the current and future network topologies within a single rack of nodes ("ICR"). The 2x10Gbe interfaces per node will be configured as a single LAG aggregate interface for link redundancy so act as one IPv6 interface.

The requirement for a "Public /28 IPv4" provides **14 usable IP addresses** to assign to the nodes.
If this is for the "optional" IPv4 address per production port then the question for DFINITY to clarify is if you actually need an public IPv4 range of this size (smaller ranges of /29 or /30 are more commonly offered even if you lease a full rack) due to their scarcity.
If the "Public /28 IPv4" range is used to assign a public IP address to each management consol (the BMC/iDRAC/iLO embedded management card on each hw node) I would be concerned. I don't like the idea of having **any** BMC access (i.e. protocols for the management web UI, KVM, RedFish API, etc ) directly on public IP addresses. Normally these BMC's should be on a separate private IPv4 /28 range connected using a separate1Gbe switch (also used to access the management port on your main switch for config and monitoring).  *All* access to this private management network should go through a **secure** firewalled jump-box or private VPN gateway that makes it **very difficult** for anyone other that the (few) node provider tech staff to access the management ports of all the hardware (servers and switches). This network access to manage hardware should be treated like the physical access required to access the hardware... lock it down, only authorised and verified individual personnel get anything near direct access.

As for your question (2)  the minimum replica nodes each data centre and each node operator is allowed to host is restricted by policy voted on by the NNS and would be currently enforced by the IC-OS deployment process (??).  I am not sure on the specifics but it depends largely on the decentralisation criteria in play (which is the main topic of this form thread). 
The practical limit on how many nodes you can provision in each data centre rack would be about the current 28 node limit per node operator (assuming 40RU per rack minus space for  the multiple switches and supporting gear you would need to run that many nodes).  Again for IC decentralisation reasons an operator with the financial means to purchase (not lease) that many nodes would find splitting that many nodes across multiple racks and/or data centres is not a huge deal anyway.

@SvenF is any of the above wrong or misleading?  I am not the expert here, just what I understand from detailed reading of the relevant wiki and forum pages.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-04-17 08:38:30 UTC | #187

Hi @icarus , I am not a networking expert as well but I think it is a good and exhaustive summary. Networking setup is very different per data center operator, so we are working on a more generic and easy networking guide to add to the wiki. For the networking, the requirement is one IPv6 /64 subnet (each node gets multiple IPv6 addresses) and four IPv4 addresses (for specific use in the future, e.g. boundary nodes). The advise indeed is to not expose the BMC directly to the internet.

Where and how many nodes to set is dependent on the decentralization rates and where the community prefers to have new nodes being set up. The limit is driven mainly determined by the benefit/costs of setting up nodes per country/region, and is reflected in the remuneration table (see https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration).

-------------------------

hoosan | 2023-04-17 14:11:16 UTC | #188

Hi @icarus and @SvenF,

Thank you very much for the detailed and comprehensive explanation. There were pages on links I had not read and the information there was very helpful. I understood that the /28 (min /29) IPv4 range is necessary for future use as boundary nodes, etc. I totally agree that we should prepare a remote VPN gateway or similar for BMC access.
It is also very gratifying to know that a more general and easy networking guide will be added to the wiki. There seems to be no link to “reference design [3,4]” on the network requirements page, so it would be greatly appreciated if you could add this as well.

Dear all, as you have probably seen the remuneration proposal V2 was published on the Internet Computer wiki ([NP Remuneration V2](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration)) and voted in by the community. During the past few weeks, valuable feedback was shared by both the community as well as future and existing Node Providers. I would like to share with you the major feedback and the outline of the proposal that is being prepared for an updated remuneration model (which will be called V2.1).

**Feedback from the community**

In general, responses have been positive on the remuneration model V2, and this model is seen as a further step in the direction towards a fully automated remuneration model that is run by the NNS. A small group of new Node Providers have started the onboarding process and as is visible on the Internet Computer dashboard, the [first node machines](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/provider/kos24-5xact-6aror-uofg2-tnvt6-dq3bk-c2c5z-jtptt-jbqvc-lmegy-qae) based on the Gen2 Hardware Specification have been added to the network.

In the meantime, there have been several suggestions and comments from the community to further improve the remuneration model:

* The main suggestion has been that rewards should be based on costs for running node machines in a specific country instead of a more coarse-grained region, in particular for the Asian region. The costs for buying a node machine do not differ considerably across countries, but costs for operating the nodes (in particular the networking costs) can be significantly different across countries, even within a specific region.
* Hence, instead of having a remuneration per region (as is the case remuneration V2) having a more granular remuneration per country is more accurate for future node providers.
* Another suggestion has been to let the multiplier cover the actual risk premium (business risk, project risk, country risk) for operating a node machine. The multiplier should not cover differences in operating costs for running a node machine. Like the first suggestion, this suggestion also implies to have specific remuneration per country instead of per region.
* A final suggestion has been made regarding the decentralization goals. The goal of decentralization should be to introduce Gen2 node machines in new countries (and to a limited extent in existing countries) until a certain number of node machines is reached. After this number of node machines is reached, there should be less incentive to add more node machines in that specific country as it would not add to the further decentralization of the IC-network. Hence, after a certain number of node machines has been reached in a country, the remuneration model should be updated to reflect this. This update applies only to the subsequently added nodes.

**Remuneration V2.1**

Based on these suggestions, an updated remuneration model for Gen2 is proposed which for clarity is called [V2.1 remuneration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration). There is no change in the parameters and formulas used (geography multiplier and reduction coefficient), so the basics of the remuneration model do not change.

The specific changes proposed are the following:

* No entry for the region Asia will be used anymore. For the Asia region, specific country entries will be used.
* Specific entries for Hong Kong and India and other countries will be added to the remuneration table. In future, through community proposals, other country entries will be added as well.
* The multiplier is set to a value of 2 for all countries. In future, this might be updated through a new NNS proposal if the community wants that the risk premium for projects should be different for different countries (for example, if the risk of running in node machine in one specific country is higher than the risk of running in node machine in another country, this might validate a different multiplier).
* A limit is set to the number of node machines in new countries for which the remuneration applies. Once this is reached, the reduction coefficient for additional node machines will be adjusted to allow adding only one or two nodes for this country, similar to existing countries like U.S. and Switzerland. Currently, the limit of number of Gen2 node machines per country is set to 50, which allows for a node in a new country to be added to every existing subnet.
* For the few Node Providers that have in the meantime started the onboarding process, the remuneration V2 will apply. This will cover a maximum of 12 node machines in total in these countries. 

I will update in this thread as well once the corresponding NNS proposal is live for voting.

**Going forward**

With this updated remuneration model, the incentive for new Node Providers to set up a small number of node machines in new countries remains, while at the same time the model sets a limit on the number of node machines to be added per country and allows for a more specific remuneration per country.

Like the remuneration model V2, the remuneration model V2.1 is also an intermediate model. Based on the suggestions and proposals from the community, the remuneration model will be further refined. Possible updates suggested, which need to be further discussed in the community, are the introduction of country risk (as discussed above), and the introduction of penalties when a node machine is not healthy.

Please continue to share any additional thoughts and suggestions on this remuneration model in this Forum thread!

Hey @SvenF, thanks for this detailed info. 

My name is Marc Johnson and I work for Protocol Labs on an initiative called Filecoin Green. We work across the entire network: IPFS/Filecoin/FVM. I'm interested in becoming an ICP Node Provider and want to connect with someone to make sure I have my info right before I submit my Self Declaration docs to the community for consideration and purchase my hardware. I have relationships with several DCs in areas that currently do not have ICP nodes, and I'm looking into hosting several Nodes. Would you or one of your colleagues be willing to connect?

More info on me here: marcjohnson.info

SvenF | 2023-05-09 08:14:50 UTC | #195

Many thanks @marcjohnson for your interest, I will follow up with you.

MalithHatananchchige | 2023-05-12 04:46:18 UTC | #196

The Remuneration V2.1 is quite impressive! I was wondering if there is any documentation available that explains the process of adding a country, such as Sri Lanka, to the Remuneration table under the Asia region. In Southeast Asia, the availability of ICP node providers is limited, and I'm keen on investing in that area. I plan to submit a proposal to onboard as a node provider next week. It would be highly appreciated if you could provide some clarification regarding the missing region. Thank you and cheers!

Congratulations to you and the team at dfinity for all the work involved with producing the new country based remuneration model. This will surely be a better way of stimulating interest among current and future IC node providers to make this World Computer true to it's name geographically as well as computationally.

I am looking forward to a follow up proposal setting up parameters for Australia and New Zealand in the near future along with other countries in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America.

Hi all,

The remuneration model V2.1 (voted in by the community, see https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/122281) is the current basis for the node machine rewards of Gen2 Node Providers. Based on this remuneration model, new node machines have been onboarded and are in the process of being onboarded in Hong Kong, India, South Africa, as well as in Europe, all of which will greatly help in the decentralization of the IC-network.

With plans from the community to set up Node Providers in other new locations as well, specifically in South Korea, Georgia, Sri Lanka and Australia, the remuneration for setting up node machines in these countries needs to be added in the reward table. You can find the additional entries for these countries on the wiki page (see https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Remuneration) and find the proposal here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123312.

Depending on the growth of the IC-network, the remuneration table will be updated and refined for new geographies. Any updates will be posted as a new proposal to be voted upon by the community.

-------------------------

Ozkangurhan | 2023-07-06 09:27:46 UTC | #206

Hi Sven, on the Wiki page, in the table which shows "the geography-dependent values and the monthly reward for the first node onboarded", I read the reduction coefficient for Australia as "0.05". Is it by mistake? Because it is relatively way much lower than other countries.

-------------------------

SvenF | 2023-07-06 09:42:36 UTC | #207

Thanks @Ozkangurhan, that's actually a typo, it should be 0.95 as in the proposal that is under voting. It now has been corrected on the wiki.

Hello @SvenF,
I am writing to introduce myself, Sagar, as an experienced professional with a background in IC. Over the past two years, my team and I have successfully assisted numerous projects in developing their products within the IC ecosystem. Our journey has also involved the creation of various internal tools, which have significantly enhanced our understanding of IC ecosystems.

Having held roles ranging from developer to Product Owner and Project Manager, I am now eager to embark on a new venture as a node provider. I am delighted that my company is committed to investing in the decentralization of IC and is keen on establishing nodes in India.

In light of this, I am seeking guidance and valuable information to aid us in this endeavor. Your expertise and insights would be highly appreciated, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn from your knowledge and experience.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly await your response.

@sagcryptoicp, thanks for your message and great to see that you are interested in becoming a node provider. 

Please have a look at the wiki information for becoming a Node Provider, and see if this answers your questions: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Main_Page. Feel free to post any remaining questions here on in the forum thread on New Node Provider Proposals (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals) for the community to respond to.

mmmzzz | 2023-09-12 15:51:39 UTC | #210

So I understand that the new node does not need an IPV4 address for the time being, because the official document only reflects the mask, prefix and gateway address of IPV6 in the node's config.ini configuration file, and does not mention how to configure the public network IPV4 address.
I don’t know if what I understand is correct, thank you very much @icarus  @hoosan
