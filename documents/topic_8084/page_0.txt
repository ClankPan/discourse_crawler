Hi, I'm on Ubuntu 20.04 in Virtualbox, 
```
npm -v
8.1.1
node -v
v14.18.1

```

When I follow the quickstart tutorial: and do "sudo npm start"
I get this error: 

```

Does any of you have an idea to get me out of this please ?

[/quote]

In which tutorial did you find `npm start`? Shouldn't it be `dfx start`?

When I try the IC locally generally it's `dfx start` to start the network and in another prompt `dfx deploy` to deploy the app on the simulated local network.

That being said, still not explains why it its an old version of node. `sudo which npm` points to the same version as `which npm`?

I found it in this tutorial: https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html

Thanks you are right, 
```

What do you suggest me to do please ?

Update: see https://forum.dfinity.org/t/quickstart-error-npm-does-not-support-node-js-v10-19-0/8084/5?u=peterparker

Regarding `npm` issue, generally speaking it is a bad practice to use node/npm with `sudo`, therefore, instead of fixing the `sudo npm` command I would advice to try to run the commands with your user `npm` and then fix the potential errors there.

`dfx` itself might need `sudo` though, this is how I fixed it on my osx (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/permissions-on-osx/5853/2)

P.S.: you can also try to generally upgrade node on your machine, current LTS version is v14 but yep, again, better to run it with your user.

@YannickPezeu alright was I said above is not fully correct and I also got the same error. Here's what I did and how I resolved it:

From a fresh project:

```
dfx new myproject
cd myproject
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
```

At this point, you can already test if you open http://canister-id.localhost:8000 in your browser
You can find the canister-id with the dfx command or in the file `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json` (the myproject_assets).

Then, I run `npm run start`, I get the error `Unable to load '@webpack-cli/serve' command` too!

To solve it, I installed a newer version of the `webpack-cli`

```
npm rm webpack-cli && npm i webpack-cli
```

Then I was able to run `npm run start` and open the app in the browser at the adress http://localhost:8080 and it was alright too

Wow ! You nailed it ! Thanks a lot !
Shouldn't this be added to the quickstart tutorial ?

Is it ok for me to say Thank you or we keep it in StackOverflow style ?

Tr√®s cool, happy to hear it worked out.

We can probably leave it as it is, just mark the question as answered.
Hopefully they will fix the issue in the next version of their sample app.

Have fun ü§ô

That error doesn't even come from us - it sounds like `npm` encourages you to upgrade. For agent-js, we specify 
```
"engines": {
    "node": "^12 || ^14 || ^16",
    "npm": "^7.17"
  },
```
in the `package.json`, so we could at least specify the `node` engine at 12, since it's the minimum that we test in our CI

For anyone's reference - you can submit changes to any page in our docs by clicking the pencil icon! Here's my PR for this issue, but anyone can suggest a change like this, and tag me and / or Carsten

The error about nodejs indeed but, the webpack error is in the `package.lock` of the sdk: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/1870
