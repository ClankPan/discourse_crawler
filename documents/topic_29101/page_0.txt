This motion proposal is a a status update from Solidstate on the Defi Vectors audit for Neutrinite DAO.

### Audit Status:
* The initial audit review has been completed and the report drafting is currently in progress, we're expecting to deliver the 1st full draft of the initial review to the Neutrinite core team on April 1st.
* Effective yesterday April 28th, billing for the audit was paused (with the approval and foreknowledge of the Neutrinite core team). This gives the Neutrinite core team time to review and respond to the findings of the initial audit review.
* On April 9th, billing will resume as the auditors execute the final audit review. We expect this to be fully completed by April 11th, and then final audit report should be published within 2-3 business days after that.

Overall, the auditors have found the Defi vectors code to be well executed by the Neutrinite core team, your DAO is in great hands!

Please vote to adopt this motion proposal to avoid a proposal rejection penalty being applied.

Thank you for hiring Solidstate, weâ€™re honored to serve your DAO in this way!

Sincerely,
