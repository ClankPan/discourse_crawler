Happy Friday ICPeople! [Proposal 130710 ](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=130710) to upgrade the NNS dapp just went live, please consider voting. :ballot_box:

This proposal includes the first version of the neurons table described in [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-dapp-feature-proposal-neurons-table-view/30750). This iteration keeps the universe selector, but replaces neuron cards with a table view. If adopted, upcoming proposals will include iterative improvements such as adding sorting, maturity column and replacing the universe selector with a second table that shows the user's neurons across all DAOs.

## Change Log

### Changed

* Display neurons in a table instead of a grid of cards.
* Removed the gap between identifier and copy button.
* Reset the scroll position on the Voting page when switching between projects.
* Universe selector icon size decreased.
* Updated colors of element dividers.

### Fixed

* Fixed the display of actionable proposals page when a single SNS fails.

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the [nns-dapp repo](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp):

```
git fetch  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout "188878273c707e48689d5c9a5bfe4a5f4e373353"
git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main && echo "OK" || echo "Commit is not on main branch!"
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm.gz
```

You may also want to verify the canister arguments. In the proposal they are binary, which is not very readable. Docker provides both binary and text formats and you can verify that the text format corresponds to the binary `arg_hex` field in the proposal.

```
cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did
didc encode "$(cat nns-dapp-arg-mainnet.did)"
```
