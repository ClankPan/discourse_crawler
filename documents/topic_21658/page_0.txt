Seers is preparing to launch its SNS DAO and will soon initiate the decentralization sale. This post presents an opportunity for the IC community to discuss the Seers SNS, ask questions, and provide feedback.

Seers is a Web3 social network similar to Twitter. Currently, it supports prediction markets and aims to develop more crypto primitives, as detailed in our [whitepaper](https://www.notion.so/Seers-Web3-Social-Network-25fa0f505b0141cabb5d7d68a11f572b). The platform operates fully on-chain, leveraging the capabilities of the Internet Computer. The code will be open-sourced soon before the sale.

Before you ask any questions, we kindly request that you review our [whitepaper](https://www.notion.so/Seers-Web3-Social-Network-25fa0f505b0141cabb5d7d68a11f572b), as it may already contain the answers you seek. We will continuously update the whitepaper with new questions and feedback. Join us on this revolutionary journey as we redefine social networking with Seers. Stay tuned for updates!

Great that you're making this step to become decentralized!

You mention that the platform operates fully on-chain, but it would be still be good to provide an architecture overview in the Whitepaper. For reference, see the SNS Launch Checklist: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/sns-checklist#12-technical-architecture--whitepaper--project-roadmap

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-03 13:46:28 UTC | #3

We are delighted to announce that we have created the proposal to whitelist the Seers team principal ID in preparation for our SNS launch. 

This marks another exciting step towards decentralization. We sincerely thank you for your continued support!

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123895

> # Enable principal qw37h-tqaaa-aaaam-abqqa-cai in SNS-W to initiate the generation of an SNS for Seers
> 
> The proposal offers the Seers dApp to the NNS to be turned into a decentralized service by creation of an SNS to govern the Seers dApp canisters.
> 
> ## Who sent this proposal?
> 
> This proposal is sent by Seers development team.
> 
> #### What is Seers?
> 
> Seers is a Web3, [**fully on-chain social network**](https://seers.social/) built atop the groundbreaking technology of the Internet Computer.
> 
> Drawing inspiration from Twitter's intuitive design, Seers improves user interaction with exclusive crypto features like prediction markets. This platform allows you to voice your thoughts and use cryptocurrencies to predict future events. But this is merely the beginning. We envision Seers evolving into a vibrant platform akin to Elon Musk's 'X', with the potential to redefine global interactions and transactions. The project is presented in [**this whitepaper**](https://www.notion.so/Seers-Web3-Social-Network-25fa0f505b0141cabb5d7d68a11f572b).
> 
> #### Seers' Accomplishments and Decentralised Future
> 
> * Over the past year, Seers conducted extensive product-market fit experiments, featuring 300 prediction markets and engaging 3,000 users. Additionally, our community has created over 10,000 posts, reflecting active participation.
> * These efforts have resulted in a remarkable Total Value Locked (TVL) of $20,000 in ICP and an estimated yearly revenue of $25,000.
> * Importantly, we have recently distributed part of the revenue to our users according to their contributions over the previous month, with some members earning up to $100 per week.
> 
> While we consider these figures modest, we firmly believe that we will experience exponential growth as we continue to develop our roadmap and tap into the full potential of the Internet Computer's capabilities. Decentralization is crucial to ramp up liquidity and deploy more powerful features...

Hey Seers Team, 
congrats on the first step towards becoming a SNS :slight_smile: 

I've been reading the whitepaper and was missing the tokenomics spreadsheet that was used to design your proposed distributions. Can you please share that?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-03 19:31:54 UTC | #5

Thank you for your kind words and interest in our project! We're thrilled to hear that you've been reading our whitepaper and appreciate your support. Here's the link to the tokenomics spreadsheet: [Tokenomics Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_z59PNo2ffJTLe2dIzjtQUg31PpctgRcYgfw7ko-Pa0/edit?usp=sharing).

We have designed our tokenomics to be similar to OpenChat's tokenomics. Notably, the 8% allocation for seed funders will be split between hodlers of the crowdfund NFT and early users. We firmly believe that this distribution mechanism will foster community participation and encourage long-term engagement.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2023-08-03 20:36:34 UTC | #6

**EDIT: nvm, I see that this cell is being calculated from the `SNS configuration sheet` and automatically rounded :slight_smile:** 

Hey, thank you for sharing, that's really helpful.

I have a question regarding this section, shouldn't the CF allocation be `(1/3)*25=8,33` assuming the max price? If Seers hits the maximum funding target, then 333,333 ICP come from the CF and 666,667 ICP from non CF contributors, that means 1/3 of the 25mn tokens (8,33mn) should be allocated to the CF, right? :thinking: 

![Screenshot 2023-08-03 at 16.27.03|690x166](upload://umWuGmiXVHl6QnMukjUGwiJpHAk.png)

-------------------------

markicp1 | 2023-08-03 22:05:27 UTC | #7

If we deposit ICP to Seers for markets are they still under Seers' control?  Meaning you could do whatever you please with the coins, and they aren't in our own wallet on Seers?

And are the markets still manually paid out?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-04 09:34:50 UTC | #8

Thanks for the question! We are decentralizing precisely to address the trust issues that arise with any centralized app. 

I'm not sure what you mean by 'manually paid out,' but in the past, we sometimes had hundreds of daily market transactions for weeks, which would have been impossible to handle manually.

We're extremely excited to begin using a sports oracle in the near future, built using HTTPS outcalls, with our target being September/October. In general, we aim to minimize reliance on governance and automate as much as possible for the prediction market feature or any other crypto primitive we implement in the future.

-------------------------

markicp1 | 2023-08-04 11:29:57 UTC | #9

So to clarify you have 100% control of all ICP the users deposit into Seers?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-04 12:21:22 UTC | #10

Well, as it stands right now, we don't have access to user funds. Furthermore, the code has never allowed us to take user funds from their ICP addresses. Some time ago, we paused prediction markets and asked people to withdraw their ICP until we decentralized. 

We have already answered these questions many times to you on Twitter and Seers, and I feel that the point you are trying to make is already clear from the title of this topic. So, I apologize if we don't address another rephrased version of the question, out of respect for the rest of the forum. Thanks.

-------------------------

markicp1 | 2023-08-04 22:08:14 UTC | #11

Thanks for the reply.  Not everyone uses Twitter and Seers so it's important to ask here as well.

On Seers there is a message that says: 

>You need to have 1 ICP deposited in your account to be able to post content. Any misbehaviour (e.g. spamming) will be punished by slashing the ICP deposited.

If you have never had control of funds how does this slashing work, and were any of the spammers slashed after this was implemented?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-05 08:16:13 UTC | #12

No slash event yet 😉, but we've already given thousands of ICP to our users from our revenue for their contributions. Have a great weekend!

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-08-05 08:28:29 UTC | #13

You are saying that you distribute more than 1000 ICP as rewards to contributors. Its really amazing if it is true. 
Would be great if you could provide relevant data to back this past 1000+ ICP reward distribution.

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-08-05 08:32:13 UTC | #14

What is it mean by 10% APY for ckBTC staking. where does this money came from?

-------------------------

markicp1 | 2023-08-05 10:55:47 UTC | #15

Thanks again for the reply but that doesn't answer the question.

**How could you slash a spammer's funds if you do not have control of the ICP that has been deposited to Seers?**  

You say you don't have access to funds but you can apparently take ICP from their deposit.  If you were to slash a spammer right now, how is it done?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2023-08-08 16:03:23 UTC | #16

Hey Seers Team, 
I have some more questions after rereading the whitepaper:

* When can we expect the code to be open source?
* Did you conduct a security audit?
* How are prediction markets settled?
* How does the the oracle for the prediction markets work?
* How does the reward scheme work?
* What exactly is the ckBTC staking referring to and how do you achieve a 10% APY?
* How does content moderation work?
* Can you distinguish between already implemented and planned features in the whitepaper?
* Are the Seers team members doxxed? If so, who exactly is part of the team?
* How does content moderation work?
* Can you elaborate on the search engine that has been mentioned in the whitepaper?
* You mention multi chain support, is this already implemented? How does this work?
* Are there any dependencies that cannot be managed by the DAO (e.g. web2 infrastructure)?

Looking forward to the answers!

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-08 16:34:43 UTC | #17

For instance, during the last week, with open prediction markets, we distributed around ~100 ICP to users from the revenue generated in the preceding week, based on their contributions such as posts and market participation. These markets have been operational for over a year. In general, we allocate all the generated revenue to our users, abstaining from charging fees and avoiding slashing due to the centralized nature of the app.

Once we decentralize, we anticipate being able to enhance liquidity and the number of markets by at least two orders of magnitude, which should result in higher revenue. Additionally, we intend to introduce an analytics page after decentralization so the numbers will actually hold meaning.

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-08 17:09:52 UTC | #18

The concept centers on rewarding users who contribute liquidity by leveraging that liquidity to generate revenue. Initially, our strategy will involve generalizing our current implementation of prediction markets, with the APY derived from their fees. While we aim for a 10% target, this figure will inevitably vary based on supply and demand dynamics.

We plan to create several sources of revenue for providers of liquidity and other actors on the platform.

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-08 17:40:55 UTC | #19

Thank you for the questions. I will address a few of them now:

* **When can we expect the code to be open source?**

The code has been open-sourced and can be found at this link: https://github.com/SeersSocial/. Additionally, we are in the process of migrating several repositories from Ethereum, such as Moloch DAO and stablecoins. However, these repositories are not yet ready and will be open-sourced at a later time.

* **Have you conducted a security audit?**

Our approach involves decentralizing with only the social network functionality initially enabled. Subsequently, we plan to reintroduce features like prediction markets in a step-by-step manner, conducting audits before and gradually increasing liquidity. The audits are likely to be carried out by Code and State. Also, we plan to have some sort of SAFU Fund.

* **Are the Seers team members doxxed? If so, who exactly is part of the team?**

Our founder, Marcio Diaz, who is a former Polkadot core developer, is doxxed, and his information is with DFINITY. As for the rest of the team, they are likely to be doxxed soon. They come from diverse backgrounds, including PhDs, Google/Meta, Web3, Mathematics, and AI.

That's currently just a piece of text, but don't tell anybody until we decentralize 🙂

Okay I'll take that to mean you're fully in control of all ICP deposited to Seers.

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-09 04:06:31 UTC | #25

Hi @cyberowl, thanks for the questions.

- That's the repository for the new frontend we've started developing. We're still organizing our GitHub; however, the Motoko code is in another one. 
- As for seed funders, we're including only our NFT crowdfunders and early users. Please let us know if you have any suggestions.

How are you doing scaling? I only see main and State.mo where all the data seems to be stored. Is this correct? Besides the file storage not sure how scaling is done. Also I only see two here. 
![Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 11.12.17 PM|690x317](upload://75awzc1L8jUnom5wYM2LoN8xdl6.png)


Also how are you doing staging testing. I don't see any tests. Where can I find more about this?

Also why not have this as a lib?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-09 06:52:20 UTC | #28

Thank you for your questions once again!

* Our scaling approach will probably mirror that of OpenChat, where each user is assigned a separate canister with stable memory usage. Perhaps with the addition of shared canisters for users that want to save costs. Currently, we're operating with modest memory usage and striving for simplicity as we progress with decentralization. We're actively conducting tests on various scaling approaches to ensure the best possible user experience.
* We're also deeply involved in the process of refactoring, generalizing, and preparing an extensive suite of tests for prediction markets. These tests will be complemented by audits and will be made available in due course. Although prediction markets code is presently disabled, anticipate their upcoming release.
* We encourage you to raise any additional concerns in the repository. This way, we can uphold the clarity of this thread by avoiding an overload of intricate details. Additionally, developers can directly provide responses to your inquiries on the repository.
* Furthermore, we will be introducing bounties to reward contributors to our repositories.

Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or require further information!

You have to be careful with that and set rate limits, any form of DDOS will drain all the cycles. I mean the cycles can be the rate limit I guess. But bots attack will add up, you might be able to detect those accounts and remove them. I know union-db is doing some good work, maybe it will be prod ready when the time comes. 

Yeah refactor is a good idea. I guess you can do that when you scale the application.

I guess this is a larger discussion with Dfinity and your early supporters but why should they be locked in a vesting period?

cyberowl | 2023-08-10 11:50:47 UTC | #38

Also you do your airdrop a bit diff from Kinic, you don't use `airdrop_distribution`. Did you find a better approach?

Will organize later to follow some kind of structure but you can find them all here: https://github.com/cybrowl/sns-archive 

Except for :dragon: & :ghost:

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-10 19:23:07 UTC | #39

Good point. I think the `airdrop_distribution` might not be effective for us in terms of the percentage of claims. Therefore, we are considering adopting a strategy similar to Hot's. Additionally, the airdrop will be based on contributions to Seers, such as the number of posts, etc. Now, we have come to realize that we might need to transfer some or all of it to the treasury. We will be consulting with DFINITY about this. cc @bjoernek

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-11 03:21:08 UTC | #40

Are you going to get that canister audited and blackholed. It does seem like going that route is not decentralized since the keys are in your hands. I understand that you need a canister to do that logic since it prob follows some formula in regards to your users activity. However, I think an audit of that would be great from someone outside the Seers team. Otherwise the canister can just redirect the rewards to burn addresses and then dilute the power of those users. Not saying you will do that but what if there is a bug?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-11 05:48:53 UTC | #41

Yes, that's another problem with that approach. We're leaning towards something between how it is now and moving all to the treasury.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-08-11 07:14:18 UTC | #42

Wow I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-08-11 07:25:13 UTC | #43

@Seers 
I am not entirely certain I grasp in full detail the options and rationale you are considering for facilitating an airdrop based on various parameters, such as posting activity on Seers. Nevertheless, keeping these tokens in the treasury and allowing the DAO to decide on the distribution timing and method seems like a transparent approach to me.

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-16 15:19:08 UTC | #44

As we talked above, we modified the [SNS init file](https://github.com/SeersSocial/sns/blob/main/sns.yml) to transfer all neurons, except those belonging to the dev team, to the treasury. Once decentralization is complete, we will initiate proposals to commence the distribution of these tokens. We believe this is the most flexible and transparent approach.

If everything goes well, we plan to deploy the SNS canisters tomorrow and subsequently submit the swap proposal when a suitable window is available.

-------------------------

What is the distribution of SEER tokens to NFT holders?

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2023-08-21 08:21:14 UTC | #47

Hey Seers team,
it would be great if you could address my remaining questions. Additionally I've been wondering if you have support for reproducible builds in place and run a testflight SNS as well as launching the SNS locally?

-------------------------

Seers | 2023-08-21 09:05:19 UTC | #48

Hello, @cryptoschindler,

I was in the process of drafting more responses. Please accept my apologies for any delays.

* How are prediction markets settled?
Prediction markets are set to be resolved through token voting using SEER. Once the sports oracle is ready, it will serve as the default resolution mechanism for all sports prediction markets. There might be a brief window available for challenges (with incentives), but generally, any matter resolvable by the oracle will be settled accordingly. The majority of markets we created during the last year can be resolved with the oracle.
* How does the oracle for prediction markets function? 
The oracle will gather input from various sports feeds and process the data to determine the outcome. We aim to ensure decentralization progressively through iterative approaches. In all likelihood, incentivization with SEER will be necessary.
* Could you explain the reward scheme?
 Currently, revenue from prediction market is distributed to users based on their contributions to the network, including posts and market engagement. As we become more decentralized, additional stakeholders will emerge, prompting us to enhance the reward system correspondingly. Diverse reward schemes will be implemented for various tasks within the social network.
* What is the mechanism for content moderation? 
We intend to employ the SEER token to incentivize users for content moderation. Moreover, we plan to introduce different feed views to empower users with the flexibility to filter content according to their preferences. Thus far, our moderation approach has aimed to be as minimal as possible.
* Could you clarify ckBTC staking and the 10% APY? 
This will initially be an experiment aimed at generalizing the operation of existing prediction markets. The potential APY is up to 10%, contingent upon factors such as fee revenue and the supply-demand dynamics of market liquidity. As we incorporate additional revenue sources for liquidity providers, the APY will become more robust.
* Are there any dependencies outside the DAO's scope (e.g., web2 infrastructure)?
Currently, there are no dependencies, and our goal is to manage all aspects utilizing the IC infrastructure to the fullest extent possible.
* What is the distribution of SEER tokens to NFT holders?
The promised SEER token allocation for NFT holders is less than 1% in the crowdfund. While we will strive for a higher percentage, the ultimate decision rests within the DAO (likely composed of NFT holders as well).

We have conducted all possible tests and are currently focused on achieving reproducible builds, which we expect to complete today.

We would like to express our gratitude and offer our congratulations to the DFINITY team for the incredible work accomplished with the SNS. Thank you! ❤️

Many people are asking us what happened with our NF allocation. Basically, we asked for 300K ICP from the NF (60%), but it was reduced to 250K (50%). We believe it was triggered by the following:

> If NF neurons opt out of the NF while an SNS proposal is open for voting, then the ICP amount the NF was proposed to receive is reduced proportionally.

From: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tokenomics/nns/neurons-fund

A couple of comments:

* We know that this rule might not be the fairest (e.g. see picture), and it's probably something that could be made better without much difficulty.
* Dfinity is working on a matching algorithm that should fix this.
* If we fail this decentralisation sale, we will keep trying with other parameters or skip the SNS. It's not a big deal, we just want the best for the IC and to finally decentralise.

Hello, as our decentralization sale did not succeed, we are planning to give it another attempt, this time by reducing the token amount to 15% of the total supply and the total ICP to 100K. Additionally, we will rename the token to ICX.

Questions: Is the *NnsProposal* field in the *sns-init* file functional on the mainnet? I believe it is not working in the sns-testing repository. Does *sns validate* work with this new format? @DanielThurau

It's difficult for anyone to invest in Dapp, which is just 1:1 a copy of Twitter, and in addition, its creators want to raise funds at all costs (no matter how much, anything, without any business plan).

Thanks for the feedback. Here are a few comments:

* Our intention is not to copy Twitter; rather, we aim to extract the best elements and enhance them through community feedback. At present, our platform differs from Twitter due to the incorporation of prediction markets, which Twitter lacks.
* Our community has urged us to expedite the decentralization of prediction markets, and that's precisely what we're working on.
* We are committed to doing our best regardless of the amount of funds available. The implementation of matching for the SNS should help alleviate price discovery concerns.

Seers was also seen posting negative inaccurate tweets about Dfinity and ICP on twitter a couple of months ago. After asking for the proof or source of their claim they could not provide a answer, so they were just tweeting negative misinformation with no facts or source to back it up, wich seemed not right for a dapp building on ICP with a following on twitter X. Cant remember exactly about what it was, something about Dfinity being centralized and having all the voting power. The way it was tweeted it raised a "question mark, red flag" for a public figure twitter account with followers to post a tweet in such manner.

Hi, we've published our new *sns-init* file here for everyone to check: https://github.com/SeersSocial/sns/blob/main/one_proposal/sns-init.yml. It's essentially the same as before, except that we've reduced the swap parameters to 15% of the supply and 100K ICP in total. We were compelled to make other changes with the new checks.

Summary of changes:

* Token symbol: ICX. We've wanted to make this change for a long time, as it better represents our dapp.
* Token name: IC X. We originally wanted ICX, but the minimum character count for the name is 4. We're open to suggestions.
* Token supply allocated to swap: 16%.
* Treasury supply: 69%. (Minimal change to satisfy one check)
* Minimum ICP: 100K
* Maximum ICP: 150K
* NF investment: 60K
* Age duration: 3 months (Changed to improve swap VP)
* Age bonus: 100% (Changed to improve swap VP)
* Swap vesting schedule events: 5
* Swap vesting interval: 3 months  (Changed to satisfy a new check)

The rest of the configuration should remain the same as before. Please let us know if you have any questions. @bjoernek

How do you explain that 1 day after a SNS failure you suddenly decide to reduce drastically the amount and quoting you : " just changed the init file" ?
Are we talking about the same project or was it simply **WAY TO MUCH OVERVALUATED** ?
Will you wait few months before sending the next proposal or just spaming the NNS again ?

Cheers

Hello everyone,

Our SNS proposal is now open for voting. Thanks to the DFINITY team for the 1-proposal feature.
Please support us on our road to decentralization!

Congratulations Seers team. Hope you could succeed with this low fund. I suggest to use this fund to enable your product and look for next round.

Congratulations Seers for your successful SNS fundraising campaign. We are happy to inform you that ICX token have been added to sonic dex.

Congratulations. Just looked up the ICX user interface and it looks nice.

1.What if Elon sues  because ICX = looks like X - smells like X - and even is called X?

2.Could there be any regulatory concerns due to sports bets and using a crypto wallet inside of the dapp?

3.Have you done the necessary legal steps to abide by whats allowed? 


Having to pay 1 ICP to be able to post will hinder adoption for people outside of the IC ecosystem.
Is there any other social media platform where the user has to pay to be able to post?....

Elon won't sue. He is too busy getting to mars. There are a million things that will kill seers, Elon won't be one.

I think the founder lives in Latin America so laws aren't as strict there.

Any answers from the Seers ICX team to the question in my last post above?
