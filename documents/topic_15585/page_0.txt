Can boundary nodes collude using ICP's main code architecture to bypass previous security walls? If so is there any identifiable solutions in order to fix or is this a major flaw to the protocol as a whole? If this isnâ€™t possible can someone please explain to me why?

Sir, the only possible answer is that Vishnu is living in the blockchains

Boundary nodes cannot collude to break the security guarantees that the IC provides. They act as a gateway to the IC and translate browser requests into API calls and route them to the replicas. See https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-node-roadmap/15562 for a description and roadmap.

Once a user has the NNS public key, all responses from the IC can be verified, like that integrity can be guaranteed. See Section 1.9 of https://internetcomputer.org/whitepaper.pdf for more details
