@diegop, since @Kyle_Langham [made à calculation in which he was saying he wouldn’t worry about of a death spiral until ICP reach $3.](https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/death-by-node-rewards?s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=direct) caused by the nodes rewarding, are we supposed to draft a proposal to pay for a while nodes with $ rather than with ICP if the bear market goes until there ?

I actually spoke to a friend + dfinity team member who told me they know it will go below $5 and to only buy then.

Logically speaking, I cannot discount anything you heard from an unknown source since I do not know who that is so i cannot address second hand rumors.

I can however provide the inverse: first hand source.

I can say that I, Diego, have never ever heard of anything like this from any Dfinity team member… and i personally know every manager and hundreds of team members at Dfinity (and 90% of Dfinity alumni).

I will let readers decide.

I will have better answers once I publish my post next week on node providers rewards, but I can say two things:

1. I do not think we are near any timeframe near danger

2. I have different  conclusions than Kyle because I have some technical information that I do not think he has (indeed we ve been digging around for a while). I know Kyle and we talk often, and I share data when I get it, but I want to make sure my numbers are solid before publishing.

Great. Thanks for your answer. Look forward to reading you coming post.

I really doubt that any kid in your playground has been officially hired as  a DFinity employee

To be clear, I didn’t say that a node reward death spiral would begin at ICP at 3 dollars, but that i wouldn't even worry about that scenario until $3.

I edit my post. And add your original statement : « In order for the Internet Computer to enter a node reward death spiral, either the IC would need to increase nodes by a factor of greater than 10 or the price of ICP would need to hit levels below $3 ».

Yeah I looked at the price the other day and saw it's around $6, down 90% in the last year and 98% from peak.

I don't care about speculation but I do wonder if builders can count on data centers still being online in a couple of years...

Data centers get paid a flat fee. I don't see why they would not be around if they are still getting paid.

Currency management is a failure at present. Why should the price follow the useless FIL? Our ICP is a truly revolutionary technology. Don't have anything to do with any useless project. If you want to be recognized by others, we must first recognize yourself.
