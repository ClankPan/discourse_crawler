Greetings community,

We are pleased to announce that we are streamlining our technical support efforts through Zendesk! You can now send all of your technical questions and issues directly to [support@dfinity.org](mailto:support@dfinity.org). Emails sent to the previous support email [sdkalphasupport@dfinity.org](mailto:sdkalphasupport@dfinity.org) will also be forwarded.

Happy coding!
