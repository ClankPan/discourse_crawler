I am afraid we lost the state of a (EXT token) canister due to too few cycles for too long. After topping up the canister, I still cannot see the interface being loaded on icscan and when running "dfx canister status", I get the following:
Status: Running
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(0)
Balance: 3_851_577_894_000 Cycles
Module hash: None 

Is there any possible way to try to recover the canister? 
However, the CAP canister is fine.

Unfortunately it does look like the canister has no Wasm module and there's no way to recover its previous state.
