Hey everyone,

I do not intend to copy/spam every reddit thread here, but this one is relevant to developers. In about 8 1/2 hours we will do an [AMA with Austin Fatheree](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/q7hkjg/ama_austin_fatheree_executive_director_of_the_new/) the executive director of ICDevs a non-profit which focusses on the IC developer ecosystem. (also none as the very helpful skilesare on the forum)

Be sure to let him know what you would like to see from the organisation!
