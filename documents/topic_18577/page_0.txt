Since two days I'm getting the following error using Internet Identity canister **locally** (dev-build) from within my app: 
![Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 09.39.10|456x404](upload://YTx6ZzMLB1FTQgJdhTAiAUK9Ae.png)

Console logs:
```
index.js:331 Refused to connect to 'http://icp-api.io/api/v2/status' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://identity.internetcomputer.org https://icp-api.io https://*.icp0.io https://*.ic0.app".
```
I'm quite sure that I did not change anything in the code related to II recently...

Does anyone have the same issue?

-------------------------

I've got a small idea why but, not sure how to resolve it so I'll forward your question to the II team to be sure they notice it.

Meanwhile, maybe I ask how you deploy II locally? Maybe you can "just" pin an older commit version and it should unblock you.

-------------------------

Thanks for forwarding to the team!

I'm simply using the latest dev-build to instanciate the canister locally:
```
"internet_identity": {
    "type": "custom",
    "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity.did",
        "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity_dev.wasm",
            "remote": {
                "id": {
                    "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
                }
          },
            "frontend": {}
 }
```
Might it be related to the `ic0.app` blacklist issue?

-------------------------

I would bet indeed that it's related to last week work about the new domain `internetcomputer.org`, like a side effect.

Instead of `https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/...` try to pin a previous release.

e.g. `release-2023-02-12_2`:

```
"internet_identity": {
    "type": "custom",
    "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2023-02-12_2/internet_identity.did",
        "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2023-02-12_2/internet_identity_dev.wasm",
            "remote": {
                "id": {
                    "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
                }
          },
            "frontend": {}
 }
```

p.s.: not sure I got above github urls correct but you get the idea

-------------------------

p_d | 2023-02-19 20:05:18 UTC | #5

I tried release `https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2023-02-12_2/internet_identity_dev.wasm` but same result...

What really puzzles me is that using `https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/tree/main/demos/using-dev-build` as a demo application for local internet identity works fine, but the same approach from within our app fails...

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-02-19 20:47:20 UTC | #6

Oh I was almost expecting that pinning the version would solve it 😥.

I read the error message again and the issue is clear to me now.

```
index.js:331 Refused to connect to 'http://icp-api.io/api/v2/status' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://identity.internetcomputer.org https://icp-api.io https://*.icp0.io https://*.ic0.app".
```

It says something tries to connect to `http://icp-api.io/...` but the CSP allows "only" `https://icp-api.io`

i.e. http vs http**s**

That said, now sure where the call is made and why it goes through http instead of https 🤷‍♂️

-------------------------

p_d | 2023-02-19 21:09:16 UTC | #7

Yes, I noticed that, however this url is not something we can configure in our app, it‘s somewhere within II wasm I guess…

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-02-19 21:11:54 UTC | #8

Maybe indeed, let’s see what team says…

Hi @p_d ,

TL;DR: do you use `0.0.0.0` for deployment? If so, apologies, we'll fix this soon.

---

We changed some of the logic for figuring out what endpoint to use for the IC, but it looks like we've broken something. Here's the logic for local development:

```ts
  if (
    location.host === "127.0.0.1" ||
    location.hostname.endsWith("localhost")
  ) {
    // If this is a local deployment, then assume the api and assets are collocated
    // and use this asset (page)'s URL.
    return location.protocol + "//" + location.host;
  }
```

Effectively this means "if the URL is `127.0.0.1` or ends with `localhost` then assume the API is a local replica served at that same URL". In production, it should be using `https://icp-api.io` instead:

``` ts
  // In general, use the official IC HTTP domain.
  return location.protocol + "//" + IC_API_DOMAIN;
```

See the source [here](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/41de943dff2a4bef5b55e702f8b8c772ffd00c98/src/frontend/src/utils/iiConnection.ts#L653-L678). We tried to reuse some logic from [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/bf6e338af103b07e28cc2c23005cff48231c80db/packages/agent/src/agent/http/index.ts#L234-L237) but evidently we got something wrong.

@p_d what do you have in your address bar when the issue happens? I'm guessing you're neither on `localhost` nor on `127.0.0.1`? Maybe `0.0.0.0`? I didn't think of that.

Either way, you probably should pin your version of II as @peterparker suggested!

Hi @nmattia, thanks for your support!

My local frontend app is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (webpack server) and `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai` (local replica). The corresponding redirect to local II is to `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai#authorize`.

So if my understanding is right this should work, isn't it?

I'm using now `release-2023-02-17` which works, I just had to ensure that the old canister was really deleted (`dfx canister delete --all`) when switching the II version...

-------------------------

p_d | 2023-02-20 15:36:26 UTC | #11

Hmmm, after having deleted all my canisters (`dfx canister delete --all`) it seems to work now also with the latest release.

I'm feeling kind of stupid now, but I guess there was something wrong in my local replica and without deleting all canisters I couldn't fix it, even with pinning a older release...

Anway, I think it should be all fine now, sorry for this issue!

-------------------------

nmattia | 2023-02-20 15:48:03 UTC | #12

Hah, that's odd!

Well, good thing it works. I think it's still worth fixing the issue for `0.0.0.0`, even though it doesn't seem to be why you had issues...

Anyway, let us know if anything else comes up!

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-04-07 15:16:45 UTC | #13

FYI @nmattia, today Joao on discord had the exact same issue and also solved it by deleting all canisters 🤷‍♂️

Anywhere I can find a functioning II repo? :sweat_smile: 
can not find any branch ```auth-client-demo``` that will give a local deployment.
Unable to find the doesn't direct to a valid II endpoint.
have the ports changed?

everything except ```spa.js``` is loaded in the redirect.

Are you looking for this? https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity

-------------------------

sadernalwis | 2023-12-26 17:30:23 UTC | #17

Actually that's where I am at rn. Thank you !
Build works.
But still haven't checked the test cases and integration.
any idea why the above doesn't work?

-------------------------

p_d | 2023-12-30 10:01:50 UTC | #18

Hmmm, I facing the same issue now with my application when running it locally **but found out that it only occurs in Chrome browser. In Safari it works fine!**

What really puzzles me is that using `https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/tree/main/demos/using-dev-build` as a demo application for local internet identity works fine, but the same approach from within our app fails. I tried to clean the cache, delete all canisters, delete localStorage in the browser, etc., but no luck...

Anyone else having this problem?

-------------------------

sadernalwis | 2023-12-30 15:33:50 UTC | #19

followed through up until here using a sepreate II build from [Repo](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity)

but the captcha won't load..

I don't. Can you reproduce the issue you are encountering with a sample repo as well?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-12-30 15:40:08 UTC | #21

Ah, I've got an idea which might explain why it works in Safari but, not in Chrome.

Are you using the auth url as described in the II's README?

> To access Internet Identity or configure it for your dapp, use one of the following URLs:
>
>    Chrome, Firefox: http://<canister_id>.localhost:4943
>    Safari: http://localhost:4943?canisterId=<canister_id>

-------------------------

sadernalwis | 2023-12-30 15:56:20 UTC | #22

fixed it by deleting the

```bash
~/.config/dfx/networks.json
```

but it think you are right about the url being the culprit.
mine works for:
by using vite frontend host;
```
http://localhost:5173/?canisterId=bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai
```

phew... for now.. :sweat_smile:

-------------------------

sadernalwis | 2023-12-30 15:58:02 UTC | #23

Thanx for checking and reply. @peterparker @p_d 
much appreciated! :pray: :pray:

-------------------------

p_d | 2023-12-30 20:07:09 UTC | #24

Arghh, you're right, I should have read the README more carefully. Chaning the auth url to the Chrome one did solve the issue... Seems that the Chrome/Firefox url changed recently, I'm quite sure it worked some weeks ago with the same url as for Safari...

Anyway, thanks a lot for your helpl @peterparker, much appreciated!

-------------------------

peterparker | 2023-12-30 20:13:47 UTC | #25

Great to hear it worked out!

@frederikrothenberger we should maybe find a way to make the note we added recently about "Local dev URL in Chrome vs Safari" in the readme more predominant?
