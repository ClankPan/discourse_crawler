Hello everyone,

If you have a web-app that is uploaded on Amazon, can you add to that web-app features that are connected and working on internet computer? I dont want all the web-app be on internet computer only some features. To be more spesific I need to store some data on internet computer that I want to protect and proof them if needed via blockchain for every user.

Can this be happen?

Thank you!

Yes this is possible. You can access your data stored within canisters via JavaScript. To have only parts of your application on IC is a valid use case.
