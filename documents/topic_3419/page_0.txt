So I've just bought a small amount of ICP and i'd like to stake it for the meantime to put it to work (I'm not planning on developing on the IC for a little while). I feel like there are many people like me who can't get a whole ICP token, or are using most of their ICP for dev costs, but would love to support the network. My question is, Will/when will this be possible? Are there any NNS proposals to lower the entry level? Cheers.
