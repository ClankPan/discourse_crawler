Are nonces used in IC for preventing replay attacks and ordering of transaction on a per principal basis? If so, are the nonces per canister i.e. every canister tracks the "account" state and hence the nonce too? I know how this works in Ethereum but trying to see how that is dealt with in the IC. Thanks in advance.

ICP uses [request ids](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#request-id) that have the same effect of nonces. I was not around when request ids were defined, but I would bet that acting as a nonce was one of the design goals
