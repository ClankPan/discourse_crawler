That is basically the question. I was messing around with icx-proxy and got it work serving from localhost:3000, but realized it was serving the assets fine without the .raw. and then it occurred that it may not be certifying content AT ALL.  Which I guess is fine, but maybe there is a way to request certification if we want it through the proxy?  If I host my own domain name at domain.app, I do want to serve certified assets and data.  Maybe it is just the HTTP requests that are not checked?  We could always end a certification in a response header I guess?
