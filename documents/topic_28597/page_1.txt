The disbursement key is an additional key who gives access to operation disburse. The II controller can still do all operations, even if the controller looses access to the disbursement key. Does this clarify your concern ?
[/quote]

The term "disbursement key" that is being referred to here, what exactly is its form? Is it similar to an encrypted Ethereum public/private key or is it just an authentication UI button like the same process when we log in to NNS ?

I still confuse, let's use an example so I can visualize how the interaction would be like on NNS:

Example Case: 
Through NNS, User A creates a new neuron and binds it with a disbursement key for 3 years. When the neuron dissolved in the third year and becomes eligible for disbursement, how will the process of disbursement exactly will work? Will it still be the same process as disbursing a neuron currently? Would it require entering the private key for disbursement, or will NNS automatically detect that the Internet Identity performing the disbursement is the one that create & own the disbursement key (meaning the user does not need to know or remember their private/disbursement keys, and everything is done automatically by NNS).

How about the process of claiming maturity ? does user always need to enter the disbursement key to claim maturity from a PoK bounded neuron ?

I believe this stems from a greater issue:

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:1, topic:22687"]
The current APY Scale can be found below;

6 Months - 8.9%

1 Year - 9.4%

2 Years - 10.5%

3 Years - 11.5%

4 Years - 12.6%

5 Years - 13.6%

6 Years - 14.7%

7 Years - 15.7%

8 Years - 16.7%

Information provided can be cross referenced at:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance

This depicts that 6 Month Neurons are incentivized at 53% of the rate of 8 Year Neurons (8.9%/16.7%), while having the staking obligation of 6.25% of an 8 Year Neuron (6 months/96 months).

Additionally, a pattern that can be noticed within the staking reward scale, is that each additional year of staked time, results in about a 1% increase in rewards - however, the base layer of rewards, is 8.9% for only a 6 month timeframe.

This raises the question: should short term staking incentivization be reduced to create a more even playing field in correlation to long term staking?

Also what’s the reason the disbursement key is not required to interact with the neuron? A neuron that is managed with quill requires a PEM file. A neuron that is managed by Ledger requires the PIN / seed phrase. 

A neuron that has a disbursement key but is not required to use it to perform functions weakens the link to the neuron don’t you think?

As I understand it, the "disbursement key" does not alter the neuron management process, nor does it affect the fund withdrawal process even after 8 years. Essentially, the "disbursement key" represents a psychological attack aimed at the potential buyer, suggesting that the seller might use it after 8 years to redirect all funds to their own address. The sole purpose is to deter people from buying neurons, as there is no 100% certainty of receiving the funds after 8 years.

I would suggest to restrict the scope of the disbursement key only to disburse the ICP of a dissolve neuron (and potentially also to staked maturity).

This seems to significantly nerf the deterrent.  I'm much less willing to buy a neuron if I'm going to have a race to harvest maturity from a dishonest seller. The whole reason I'm buying the neuron is to get the maturity. (I'd imagine a bit would emerge to try to snipe, but I guess both sides can use one....then it is just a race)

In fact a much more significant deterrent might be to give it the rights to split. Then an attacker could cut he thing into a thousand pieces and the buyer would rarely ever get to harvest(although I guess they could combine back.

Basically you want the dishonest seller to be able to make the neuron inoperable for the buyer or I don't think it is a deterrent at all.

hpeebles | 2024-03-22 00:31:09 UTC | #115

If the disbursement key can only be used to disburse a fully dissolved neuron then it has no impact on people buying neurons who never intend on dissolving them. I'd happily buy an 8 year neuron at a discount regardless of if it has a disbursement key and just leave it locked and earning rewards.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2024-03-22 00:34:07 UTC | #116

This seems to solve it.

We could make every neuron have a permanent key which the controller can query for at any time (or maybe we'd need vetKeys so that the key never exists in the replica?) and which can be used when calling `manage_neuron` for any operation (it can't be just for disburse for the reasons mentions in my previous post).

This way you can never fully trust a neuron which was previously owned by another user, destroying the demand for neuron markets.

This is simple for users, makes all neurons equal, requires no special behaviour from users to add PoK, and prevents neurons from being tradable.

This would also allow for the neuron's controller to be changed since it could only ever change between principals owned by the same user. For example if I wanted to move a neuron from being controlled by my II to being controlled by a hardware wallet.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-03-22 01:56:39 UTC | #117

Hmmm? I ask for a vetKey that the governance canister gives me and I upload my key encrypted with it. How does it know it what my key is so it can let me call network functions? You need a trusted party to produce the encrypted key and produce a pub key you can trust.

I think that is what PoK gives you with a different method. You can just prove you have the key.  Well..isn't that just a signature of some random data?  Probably understanding the tech better would be helpful for me.

But it think you are on to the right idea. If there is a key that can't be divested then it eliminates trading of neurons. 

We get this easy for standard canisters principals. If it is a canister principal making the neuron, tie it to the self auth principal controllers forever. If it is controlled by a canister principal I think you have to have a dox list(known neurons, sufficiently decentralized SNSs, etc.)

Can the Tecdsa canister track produced keys so we know which keys are Tecdsa?

Maybe every neuron gets a Tecdsa key added to it from the NNS that has a write only allow list that every key that ever has access get added to and can always make a call through. 

The negative here is that if your key is stolen there wouldn't be much you could do.(maybe there is a NNS prop to report stolen keys)

When you add a key to II it goes in the allow list. Canister controllers (self authenticating) are added for canisters. Canisters controlling canister are tracked back through the chain until you get to a self auth principal or SNS, NNS, blackhole, or doxed org. (Can control chains be circular? Maybe these are the only ones that need a penalty) (canister control chains might grow exponentially....🤔)

ajismyid | 2024-03-22 02:34:31 UTC | #118

What if someone created a DApp called 'Neuron Rental Market,' where neuron owners could transfer their neurons to the dApp controlled-canister, then, renters who access the Neuron Rental Market DApp would have permission to use the voting power associated with those transferred neurons without needing to actually transfer ownership of the neuron between the owner and the renter. Instead, the DApp canister serves as the custody/intermediary. The renter does not care about disbursement or claiming maturity. They just want to use the voting power.  Under this system, wouldn't the disbursement keys lose all significance for protecting ICP governance security?

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-03-22 06:25:11 UTC | #119

I still believe that, as long as the tokens are locked, it's possible that the same guarantees hold regardless of the owner.

Also, I would expect good and bad neuron marketplaces to exist. Most users would choose to buy in good marketplaces, which might have safety measures like 'an 8-year-old neuron can only be sold if it last voted 1 year ago'. Or maybe the market will price in these factors.

Honestly a 20% penalty on rewards feels pretty weak in the grand scheme of keeping optionality. A 6 month neuron earns 50% lower rewards currently than a 8 year neuron, but now I can get higher rewards for a 8 year neuron without a PoK (that I can sell) than a 6 month neuron with PoK? Something feels wrong here
[/quote]
The precise amount of the penalty can be fine-tuned and maybe we can come up with some kind of formula instead of the flat 20% suggestion. I guess we should also consider that selling a neuron typically involves discount so there is an additional penalty applied by the market. 

Regarding your other question I will get back to you later.

Phase 2 (in the way it is currently defined) would not be a big change, from my perspective (but I did not review this with the NNS engineering team in detail yet).

Phase 3 would be a relatively big change. We just started the discussion of the high-level ideas and it will take probably take some time  to define the detailed design (assuming we reach an agreement to go in this direction). Afterwards it would take certainly several months for implementation.

In this case the neurons under the control of this dApp would be canister controlled and hence the system would recognize them as transferable and apply a discount to the rewards. So the described set-up would be possible but those neurons would get lower rewards.

I think as part of the syndication we should agree on the general direction of travel and also confirm this via a motion proposal. I think the motion proposal would not need to describe all details yet, but a sufficient amount of detail so that the majority feels comfortable. 

If an agreement is reached, phase 1 (Lift restrictions on canister control over neurons) could be implemented relatively quickly from a technical perspective.

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-03-22 12:43:46 UTC | #127

Since everyone agrees on Phase 1 and agrees that there is no immediate threat, maybe we can lift the restriction and gather more data on the pros and cons for a period of time—let's say one year—before revisiting the discussion with more information and deciding on Phases 2 and 3. After all, that's the power of the NNS: we don't need to get things right from the start, and there is a bit of room for experimentation.

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-03-22 13:53:52 UTC | #128

Ye, it seems the majority of the discussion is around phases 2 and 3.

We are kind of already in phase 1 with ECDSA and HTTP outcall controlled neurons - So it would make sense to just remove the self-auth principal check (which is an easy change) and proceed the discussion over time as you said with more real world data.

I wonder what's the counter-argument for proceeding like this?

I think it would be useful to agree on the overall strategy before we go ahead with Phase 1, but I agree that not all details of later phases have to be defined upfront.  This would give some planning security to developers working on projects which involve canister controlled neurons. 

With respect to your point on data: I think this is a good avenue and I had similar thoughts. For example if we established some periodic metrics showing the (potentially approximative) breakdown of neurons into different subclasses (e.g. transferable because II-controlled, in the future canister-controlled etc) then this would be very helpful input. However, I think this is not straightforward and I have to think a bit more about this.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-03-22 21:10:55 UTC | #130

Thank you. But the more fundamental question is why have any non PoK neurons at all? It seems to me best to force all neurons to have PoK as the very existence of non PoK neurons has limited upside for big downsides (added complexity, threat to governance, etc etc).

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2024-03-22 21:55:18 UTC | #131

I think there are very very few neurons that pose a threat today. OpenChat, maybe a couple others? You think we need to force all existing neurons to do a PoK just to cover the few that aren’t already non-transferable?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-03-22 23:04:29 UTC | #132

I'd like to double click on this idea which I think is great. 

1. Making all neurons have a PoK

2. Making all neurons transferable, so I can transfer my hardware controlled neuron to a canister or to II

Regarding 1, I believe that there is simply no upside to having any neurons at all that don't have PoK. We are planning for the future and we don't want a large number of non PoK neurons to emerge as those neurons could end up on a marketplace. It is just a bad idea. 

Regarding 2, this is simply a brilliant idea. There are a lot of neuron holders out there who created neurons using PEM files and hardware wallets, and frankly, their entire security setup is a joke since it entails putting seed phrases in different places or encrypting PEM files and hiding them. It's not a professional institutional setup and it's quite frankly ridiculous. This is true for the vast majority of the voting power on the IC. If people who setup neurons with PEM files could transfer them to Orbit when it finally launches to have an institutional multisig that would strengthen the security of the network as a whole so entire neurons don't accidentally get lost. And since all neurons are required to have PoK, then we preserve the feature that limits neuron marketplaces. It is the best of both worlds. 

@bjoernek thoughts?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2024-03-22 23:39:14 UTC | #133

I guess I’ll just throw this out there.

I think forcing existing neurons to have a PoK might have unforeseen consequences.

Basically, stakeholders that keep up with current events will immediately register their PoK while others who may not be as active in governance could go months without realizing that they are suffering a penalty. 

Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I think this would result in greater rewards for active members and a significant shift in voting power. Maybe that’s ok? Idk.

-------------------------

dx111 | 2024-03-23 02:16:37 UTC | #134

I disagree with the second and third phases. 
What ICP needs is simplicity and user-friendliness. For instance, the experience with Polkadot is remarkably seamless, devoid of the need to grasp intricate terminologies. Anyone can engage and disengage effortlessly without daily voting obligations or apprehensions regarding diminishing rewards. As for security, I harbor skepticism that anyone would expend billions to acquire neurons, only to enact detrimental actions within the community. In this vein, a waiting period akin to Polkadot's 28 days could be considered.

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-03-23 19:37:53 UTC | #135

> a waiting period akin to Polkadot’s 28 days could be considered

This could be another option. Perhaps a transfer delay of ~1 month during which you can't vote, or maybe it could vary according to the dissolve delay (VP).

It seems a good property to allow a neuron to be able to exit/enter the 'full reward' state (possibly repetitively), depending on whether it might be transfered (hot neuron) or not (cold neuron). @bjoernek

I agree that’s how it’s presented in the proposal. If I’m understanding @dfisher correctly, he seems to be proposing that we force PoK on all existing neurons too. I just wanted to point out that I think this will have a huge impact on the existing distribution of voting power and rewards.

I don't quite understand the assertion that ALL NEURONS must be PoK. By "All Neurons," I interpret it to mean every neuron that currently exists and those that will be created. I find this completely unfeasible. A vast number of neurons have already been established, and many have simply chosen to follow others, stepping back to concentrate on their own matters. Eight years from now, they'll be taken aback to discover they haven't received the expected profits, or conversely, could have earned more had they not missed the opportunity to perform PoK at some point. This must categorically not be done!

It seems that "we"—the NNS majority—are individuals with neurons in the ledger. How can we vote on this matter for ALL NEURONS and remain unbiased when "we, the majority," already effectively serve as PoK, and for this majority, the situation with their neurons remains unchanged? What kind of unbiased voting can there be? Or should we revisit and openly declare that DFinity, as many have already suggested, is indeed a centralized system at this point? The only thing we can do is to decide on the rules for creating new neurons.

For sure... whatever we do, we should act in good faith, be considerate about perceptions, maintain permissionless interaction as much as possible, and act with fairness within the bounds of the possible...maybe even faulting on being overly gracious toward those affected. I'd imagine there is quite a bit of 'good governance' literature, patterns, and anti-patterns we can learn from.

A lot of debates get derailed by half the people taking a potion of where he should go and the other taking the position of how we should get there.  The path to many good destinations are dangerous and filled with bad governance.  Most destinations can be reached via good governance and via win-win-win scenarios. I tend to think first about what we want the next ideal state to be and then figure out how to get there.

I want to revisit the problem we are attempting to solve. The issue description mentions a voting attack, but the essence lies in the details. These details indicate that a similar attack on Dfinity would be impossible if we consider the neurons. Perhaps we should focus on addressing real problems instead of creating problems only to solve them. The current situation is such that executing a similar attack in Dfinity would take more than one month! It requires a month to securely purchase an identity and another month to safely sell one. Acquiring enough identities for voting could take six months to a year, with an equal amount of time needed to sell them afterward. What's the likelihood that the investment made in the attack will be recuperated, especially considering the limited number of identities available for sale? Now, with the timeframe for the attack spanning from six months to a year or more, the question arises regarding the feasibility of this attack, even without considering the financial costs involved.

In my view, implementing Proof of Knowledge (PoK) for ALL neurons utterly devastates any potential liquidity of the neurons. Neurons become a deadweight within the system, relegated solely to voting purposes. Billions in assets will effectively be erased from financial activities. If this is the intended goal, it should be explicitly stated as such.

Continuing the thought, a question arises: What will have a more negative impact in the end?
1 - A hypothetical attack that requires a year or more to execute and a substantial amount of funds.
2 - Permanently locking away billions in neurons from liquidity, since they will not be able to participate in any way in the financial sector of the ecosystem.

> Without the lock in

The proposal is not about eliminating the lock-in. Leaving is not free. Currently, neurons are being sold at a discount of 25% to 65%, with most of them close to the higher range.

My reasoning is that we probably don't need someone willing to lose 50% of the value to be voting in the NNS. These neurons will be better cared for in other hands.

So, before investing engineering efforts, I would love to see some more data and, if necessary, implement something simpler and more flexible like the transfer delay mentioned previously.

Responsible voting naturally indirectly affects the success of a project. However, the big question is - how much more responsibly does an 8-year-old neuron vote compared to a 2-year-old one? Yes, there is a difference, but is it significant? I also want to note that responsible voting is not a panacea for the success of a project. One can vote very responsibly and still end up with nothing in the end. I believe a significant portion of a project's success does not depend on responsible voting!

I don't know how this being the stated goal could be any more clear. It is the fundamental assumption of the NNS. Everyone(other than Genesis) knowingly clicked "LOCK". Not "MAYBE LOCK" or "LOCK UNTIL I"M READY TO NOT BE LOCKED".  "Billions in assets will effectively be erased"?  They aren't erased! They ARE the security of the network! You either have security backed by BILLIONS of dollars or you have security until unknown unknown conditions demonstrate that you have NO security.

This is THE ONLY security mechanism we have to guarantee the network's best interests are kept by the voters.  It's like you're saying "do we really want all that hashing power to be locked into ONLY trying to find the next BTC block hash? What a waste!"

If we don't find a permissionless way to make sure that voters endure the market effect of their choices then we have to go back to the drawing board or find a punitive way to deal with neuron markets(an awful waste of time if we have permissionless ways).

[/quote]

This goes so hard against two of my fundamental assumptions that I'm not sure where to start. First, you only need one hypothetical attack for this whole grand experiment to be over(this ignores other bad "in the ends" where the network just didn't make as many long-term positive decisions due to wink-wink ways out of our neurons).  So given semi-finite time but an infinite number of combinations of possible attacks I would say that 1 most certainly has a much more negative impact in the end.  Secondly.  We want liquidity locked away!!!! That is the entire mechanism of the tokenomics.  Tokens locked equals a reduction of supply. Reduced Supply + Increased Demand is the formula for🌛. If they are liquid then the supply doesn't reduce.

I'll cede that there may be some anti-fragility to be gained by letting these markets play out a bit so that we see the volatility and stressors that it will bring into the system. But that only works if you're able to react more and more ably to the contagion.  So if we are prepared to build a financial violence set of white blood cell processes to seek out and destroy neurons attempting to avoid enduring the market effects of their votes and delegations, then I can get behind it to protect the network. But if we can find a way for math to make it impossible without all that effort? There are lots of other problems to solve.

Be careful about 'data' here. The lack of presence of evidence in a set does not prove the absence of possibility.

This is a great question.  I'm not sure. There is certainly some studies and evidence out there that being 'tied to the mast' increases the probability of people successfully achieving their goals.  But from 2 to 8 years may be a small variance. (but this is a question of lock time and a fundamentally different issue...if we can make a proper case for 2 years being the functional max, then let's do it).

I like to hope(and this is pure hope) that in all the possible universes out there, the ones where the IC is successful is likely due to dumb luck, proper incentives, or some combination of both. I hope that the ones with proper incentives are additive. If they are not, then why not flip a coin instead of voting?

In the universe where we fail, certainly, some of them will be dumb bad luck, and some will be from optimal planning that turned out to be wrong, but again, if we do think that incentivization of long-term planning has negative utility then let's just stop with all the nonsense and find a different governance method.

We either think that humans can use their intelligence and economic systems to bend the arch of history to where we want it to go or we don't.  If we don't...man..lets just hang it up...honestly, this voting thing is a bit of a pain in the rear end.😂

> If we ever see the evidence of the kind of activity that breaks the security of the network it will be so far outside what was predicted by the ‘data’ that you have thought it impossible

Fair point, it worries me too. It's somewhat counterbalanced by:

* If the danger is a marketplace accumulating too much VP, I think it's not much different from what you can achieve by buying votes. 
* I'm not sure how effectively something critically dangerous can be avoided by merely reducing rewards.
* DFINITY + ICA still hold 20% of the VP, so you only need an additional 31% (out of the remaining 80%) to be secure (i.e. passing a proposal that kills the whole thing).
* To some degree, this is akin to saying let's not push another line of code because it might contain a critical bug. The danger is becoming rigid like Bitcoin. 

If something like transfer delay gets implemented:
- These markets will mostly have hot neurons, therefore won't acquire VP.

> I would assume in a bull, late in the network’s live when 95% of ICP is staked because voting in the NNS is so valuable that this discount goes to near zero if the market is still possible yes?

A 95% staked ICP could only be possible if we are able to freely transfer neurons. I don't see how staked tokens could be valued the same as unstaked tokens, unless we truly need that neuron liquidity.

> By the time the get around to selling you will have already paid them handsomely for their sub-optimal votes.

Only when they get around to selling can you truly call the subsequent votes sub-optimal. However, it would be better for them to immediately list the neuron for sale, thereby transferring the voting power. But I believe this applies only after the sale has been completed; otherwise, they are reducing the price. Assuming knowledge propagates immediately, which I think is an important part of this topic.

In a transfer delay setting, as soon as they decide to sell the neuron, they will probably be better off clicking the transfer-countdown button, which forbids them from voting.

> Maybe a transfer delay is ok, but I want the maturity back as well. There is no reason we should pay for work that wasn’t done to the contract.

I think that up until the time the proposal is adopted, we should assume the work has been done according to the contract. After the proposal is adopted, the contract changes, and it's more like we are all getting paid more compared to before.

Also, rewards are likely to push the price of the neurons further downwards, since there will be more people willing to sell at lower prices.

dfisher | 2024-03-24 22:51:57 UTC | #154

Been giving this some thought. 

1. I believe all existing and new neurons should be forced to have PoK. This is precisely in order to prevent liquidity forming around a marketplace. 

2. If this is not technically possible, or is deemed undesirable for some reason, only neurons with PoK should be transferable. This will ensure that the same owner is able to transfer his / her neuron from hardware wallet, to II, to a canister. Canisters shouldn’t be able to control neurons that don't have PoK. I don’t think it’s necessary to incentivize neurons to be PoK through monetary rewards. It should just be a simple ban on transferring the neuron if it’s not PoK. 

I would like to reiterate two points. Firstly, this structure will prevent liquidity forming around a marketplace of neurons as only PoK neurons are transferable. Secondly, PEM file / hardware wallet neuron owners need to be able to transfer their neurons to canisters in order to get an institutional security setup (through services like Orbit).

EDIT: if we have to impose a monetary penalty on not making your neuron PoK, because the above is somehow not possible, would set it at 100% which would achieve a similar result.

-------------------------

dx111 | 2024-03-24 23:47:18 UTC | #155

I think it is meaningless for neurons to have Pok, because neurons can still be sold normally, and users may buy neurons with poK without knowing it, causing losses, and someone may make a fraud app to sell neurons

-------------------------

darien | 2024-03-25 01:20:20 UTC | #156

any time you invest your money into something , it is your responsibility to DYOR....in any case, PoK might even help users that don't by reducing the amount of neurons being sold

-------------------------

darien | 2024-03-25 02:03:43 UTC | #157

From the time that you purchase ICP and decide to create a neuron, you should be aware of a few rules when it comes to IC Governance.
Two of them are....Neuron are not supposed to be traded and Once you lock it, it's locked for the duration.
With that been said.....we all know that the NNS is a dynamic Governance system with one of it's main purpose been protecting the system (at least to some extend). So after establishing a neuron, some kind of loop hole is created or bug is discovered that might affect the initial goal of the Governance System and possibly endanger the network, the natural approach is to patch or fix said loop hole or bug in order to reestablish to original spirit of the system. This is true for any governance system, laws are routinely updated. Now  If a better way of protecting the system is found and demonstrated them the spirit of the NNS should be updated and the restriction of selling and locking/unlocking neuron should be removed.  So until them and for the reasons mentioned above, I believe all neuron should be PoK and if not...no voting and no rewards.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-03-25 02:33:30 UTC | #158

Hey @bjoern and @bjoernek.  Thank you for introducing this proposal.  It has certainly stirred up a lot of good conversation.  In my opinion, we should enable canisters to control neurons.  There are many use cases for that capability and I don't think it should be as difficult as it is today to achieve.  

I also like PoK as a mechanism to deter neuron transfer.  I have always understood and believed that neuron transfer can become a security risk and is a violation of the social contract that we all enter when we choose to lock ICP in a neuron in exchange for governance rights and voting rewards.  Hence, I believe we should implement additional safeguards to mitigate the practice of neuron transfer.  Having a disbursement key as described in this forum topic that is known to the neuron owner and can never be unknown by that owner is certainly a good way to mitigate neuron transfer.  I don't think many people would be willing to buy an internet identity that controls ICP neurons if they can never be guaranteed that the original owner can't disburse the ICP.

My position on this topic is very similar to the arguments made by @skilesare throughout this forum discussion.  I don't think there was anything I read in his posts that I disagreed with on this topic.

Even though you (@bjoernek) did not propose applying PoK to all existing neurons, I also agree with the recommendations made by @dfisher that we consider expanding the scope to include all neurons.  If this is something that you plan to consider, then I would prefer to have a grace period as recommended by @LightningLad91 before a major change like this is implemented.  Hence, I think it would make sense for the grace period to be 6 months after phase 3 is implemented before it applies to all neurons.  During this time, DFINITY could conduct a communication campaign that clearly explains what is changing, the reasons for the change, and when the changes will have a material impact to current neurons owners.

I also think the concerns and solution brought up by @hpeebles and expanded by @skilesare and @dfisher should be considered further.  The PoK deterrent should apply to both not dissolved and fully dissolved neurons.  It would be great if it could be applied in a way that enables the original neuron owner to move the neuron between their own principals.

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-03-25 07:26:29 UTC | #159

Imposing non-transferability on all neurons seems like an extreme idea to me. It could potentially cripple DeFi. I would be interested in taking out loans against my neurons or seeing ICP-backed stablecoins thrive. Therefore, I would reject this approach.

I think the main issue is the rate at which neurons become transferable, but that seems to be an easier problem to solve, if it's a problem at all.

Thank you. But the more fundamental question is why have any non PoK neurons at all? It seems to me best to force all neurons to have PoK as the very existence of non PoK neurons has limited upside for big downsides (added complexity, threat to governance, etc etc).
[/quote]

There’s currently an Internet Identity market place in existence on the IC. Forcing all neurons to be PoK would ruin that business overnight- rendering their product useless after a dev team has spent years to study the IC and create the codebase. 

It sets a bad precedent for the NNS to make changes that would have such adverse effects on a notable project within its own ecosystem. Anybody considering developing on the IC would be deterred by the possibility that they could commit years of labor to develop a product, and with one NNS proposal, all of their hard work could be made useless.

My official position (as of now) after having read through you all’s debate is that the OPs’ (@bjoernek and @bjoern) original suggestions to create a PoK compliance option for neurons with a reward penalty on non-PoK compliant neurons is the best way forward.

I feel that their suggestion best acknowledges the nuances within the issue of: 

1. Minimizing the risks posed by bad actors intending to defraud the NNS as described by @skilesare in [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597/52?u=jesse) post. 

2. Accommodating the natural, free-market interest for a neuron market place that has become apparent within the ICP ecosystem. 

3. Preserving  business models of projects that rely on the existence non-PoK neurons such as [NFT geek](https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/)

4. Preserving the NNS’s reputation as a web hosting platform that doesn’t torpedo its own projects built within its own ecosystem as a result of said project creating a business model that was completely within the technical bounds of the NNS’s system.

If, in the future, we find that too much of the NNS’s voting power is allocated within non-PoK compliant neurons to the point where it poses a security risk to the network, we could always adjust the reward penalty on non-PoK compliant neurons to influence a shift in voting power from non-PoK compliant neurons to neurons that are PoK compliant.

Just look for centralization of voting power & you’ll find your answer - there are 3-4 entities that make the decisions here; Synapse & Friends.

If they cared for the network as they’ll virtue signal to you, they wouldn’t have stood in front of countless proposals that’d potentially redistribute their majority of governance vote power -  yet here we are; with the decision entirely in their hands, again.

EDIT: Because I found it comical, I figured I should add the fact that the proposal passed, but because DFINITY didn’t prioritize it “it’s void, doesn’t count, resubmit proposal”, and a previously passed proposal was resubmit until the desired outcome of rejection was achieved, because the monopolozing entity realized it wouldn’t be beneficial to them in retrospect.

To understand whether there's a threat within the voting system, it's essential that the system is fully transparent. Access to a complete list of neurons, their voting records, and their follow lists is necessary. Without this transparency, we are left with mere speculation and cannot grasp the full scope of what's happening. When the topic of disclosing neuron lists arises, privacy concerns are frequently cited as a reason for withholding information. However, for the sake of transparency, detailed personal information or the principals behind the neurons are not required. Simply providing the NeuronId, which is inherently anonymous and has no direct link back to the principals, would suffice. Here's an example of a voting scenario as described in the post - https://twitter.com/retalti/status/1770352862922514501

One can also recall the incident with the 'Psychedelic' project, the project we lost due to disagreements. It apparently received a considerable grant, but for some reason, is now absent from the list of grants. However, a simple search on this forum using the project's name should suffice.

`There’s a significant beef between Psychedelic and the community & DFINITY. Psychedelic took over 1 million in grants from the foundation and then after butting heads with DFINITY over roadmap priorities, left.`

Let's not conflate what can be a serious and hard issue of a lot of hard work by 3rd party devs being moved down into the replica layer with an instance of someone manipulating a loophole in direct opposition of the obvious intent.  In no universe did the ID Geek guys not have the conversation that it was likely and probable that the neuron market would be shut down eventually but to move ahead anyway because the tech was cool and it would force the issue and eventually make the network stronger.  Also, I don't think anyone has seriously suggested doing anything that would affect current neurons which would be able to continue using ID Geek into the future.  Will these changes affect the potential future size of their market? Yes. Does activating canister-owned neurons affect their business(why go through the hoops of an II swap-a-roo when canister neurons will be much simpler and more liquid?)  Yes also. I doubt this discussion is a surprise to them.

Those guys have built some awesome tech in lots of areas and I think they have a very bright future even with a security-threatening feature being patched.

As far as I understand the restriction in neuron transfer is to avoid the "nothing at stake" problem, where someone votes against the interests of the network and is not penalized because the neuron is sold immediately after.

However the technical solutions to this seem to ignore the existence of an ecosystem outside of the Internet Computer. A malicious actor can already easily vote against the interest of the network while at the same time shorting the ICP price on some external exchange.

What am I missing here?

I agree PoK could become a threat to the IDGeek business model (depending on how extensively it is applied), but @alexander, @alexeychirkov and the team that built the app definitely knew that it violates one of the central tenets of the ICP governance model and that DFINITY was interested in "exploring ideas on how to make it more difficult to transfer neurons".  Below is the original post when IDGeek was introduced and a quick browse through the comments will reveal that everything we are discussing today was also discussed in a similar way back in April 2023.  In fact, there have been public discussions about neuron transfer and marketplaces as far back as mid 2021 (for example [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/thoughts-on-risk-conscious-means-of-neuron-transfer/7381?u=wpb), [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-permit-transfer-of-neuron-ownership/15841?u=wpb), and [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-remove-the-is-self-authenticating-restriction-on-neuron-ownership/14948/52?u=wpb)) just after genesis and I'm quite certain that it was well known to many prior to that timeframe since at genesis so many restrictions were already in place within the IC codebase that deters and prevents neuron transfer.

The GeekFactory team has built some amazing tools and they are an important part of the ICP ecosystem.  I appreciate that they pushed the boundaries when they brought IDGeek to the market.  However, this is really not a good example for how how changes implemented by the NNS could make a developers project useless.  It's not like the GeekFactory team didn't know that they were pushing the boundaries and that changes could occur in the future that threatens the business model for IDGeek.  They pushed forward knowing the risk.

This “suggested proposal” is making me as a big token holder think twice to follow Dfinity neuron to vote on behalf me.

If I’m being affected now, of a decision I made 1 year ago by locking for 8 years, when I did a deep analysis on whether or not was profitable to lock indefinitely and get my ROI just by voting rewards instead of selling, and that I also were acknowledge that I could sell my neuron at any time in any case, I wanted on IDGEEK, and now this new rule coming a year after… 

it’s not a really good impression I got from Dfinity. BUT I would like to clarify, if this will not affect people’s decisions like this one I made, that were made before the proposal is “adopted” that’s another story but anyway we MUST think of those new users if they will see this as another limitation in terms of how confusing is this topic of voting rewards, and also they will must take care of ANOTHER “key” additional to the seed phrase.

Exactly if the main reason, of the proposal is to avoid a attacker could buy voting power for less money in the future, whats the point of the disbursement key? If the attacker is just focus on buying voting power to VOTE, and not looking to wait for 8years or whatever time to disburse the neuron…I mean, if the attacker just want power on the network why he will be looking as a threat the DISBURSEMENT KEY ? if he never planned to disburse it anyway?  Is this proposal more focus to avoid big neurons be able to sell on the open market in near future? Or is really a security concern? Or just wanting to lower the voting rewards with this narrative?

justmythoughts | 2024-03-26 05:47:01 UTC | #174

Whatever technical solution is arrived upon here, I hope that the DFINITY team puts the long term security of the NNS first.

Any other "half-measure" solution that aims to appease all parties will still make some people angry.

For developers, like IDGeek, this means DFINITY will probably need to "break" the trust assumptions of your marketplace, which is devastating. People will get very emotional. Short term holders who staked a neuron for 8 years thinking they could sell it easily later on IDGeek will yell on the forums and Twitter. The Geek team may leave the IC. People will scream centralization and to a certain degree, they will be right.

This is what happens when a loophole goes unaddressed for over a year and more and more developers start building solutions to capitalize on it. The fault is as much in DFINITY's hands as anyone else for not realizing that after HTTP outcalls this was an inevitability.

The entire NNS security model (proof of useful stake) is based on staked neurons being non-transferrable, and II (neuron) marketplaces circumvent that security.

**To short term holders/people who locked for 8 years thinking they could earn 15% a year and sell at any time:**

The reason that people choose to build on a blockchain vs. AWS is decentralization, security, and reliability. If this loophole is allowed to persist, you have a major vulnerability affecting all 3. No enterprise will adopt ICP knowing this, and that in turn will affect the token price more than the extra 15% you'd earn on the side from your 8 year neuron (enterprise adoption is the big investment money).

If you truly have long term intentions (for both the network and the price of ICP), you should want the fundamentals and security of the NNS to be bulletproof.

Disagree, it CANNOT apply to all the neurons, I decided to locked my net worth a year back to this “brilliant” Idea, that now is looking to affect my personal finances directly.

 I chose to lock for 8years or “indefinitely “ because my ROI was supposed to be get by voting rewards according to the formula proposed a YEAR AGO by Dfinity, if DFINITY plans to vote and propose to adopt something like this, in the end should affect just NEW NEURONS, for NEW users that must be aware of this new implementation, you cannot affect  personal investments in that way to people that weren’t aware that they cannot sell their neurons in the future, and if they wanna sell they will receive “20%” less rewards, that’s not serious, Dfinity will get sued by changing and affecting peoples investments decisions in that way.

I’m a big supporter and investor, with long term vision not planning to sell, but imagine how bad this idea is that even a huge supporter is getting mad about this.

You cannot affect my personal investments and finances, when the decision to locked the tokens for 8 years was made when it has never been mentioned in the past, that the rewards of the locked neurons could be affected by NEW PROPOSALS that affect the way of generating rewards Due to the protocol, the documents only mention that the rewards may vary due to a formula that each year reduces inflation and accommodates fewer rewards for voting, while increasing for age bonus, BUT it was NEVER mentioned that there could be a reduction and that I MUST decide to choose between, can SELL the neuron and get less rewards, or not being able to sell it in the future (due to a “watermark”) in said neuron to get (NOT EVEN MORE REWARDS) but to get the same rewards as was already defined in the past.

Bad bad bad decision, if what you want is limit people being able to sell the neurons because of trying to control selling pressure that’s not the way, focus on how to start getting deflation that’s the right path, you should try to fix the issue from the root. Please let community know when the proposal going live to unfollow Dfinity neuron (at least just in this occasion) but be careful with next proposals I don’t want to be follow - unfollowed dfinity till I get bored of doing that frequently. (It’s the first time I’m considering this because it’s affecting me directly and I’m sure there are another whales out there not so happy )


Also to clarify, there are people with tons more tokens than me of course, and many people with less also, but this is affecting both sides of the coin, the ones with a lot like VC’s, some like me in the middle, and so many with small amounts, that locked with the confidence to get their ROI by using the rewards, and in any emergency they could sell the identity on IDGEEK at discount price, I really suggest this just applies to NEW NEURONS, NEW INTERNET IDENTITIES, NEW USERS. 

Never put such a significant rule, where the interests of people today are affected, when said decisions were made in the past and such important information was never mentioned.

It's funny to think that lifting the restriction might lead to the whole supply being locked in 8-year neurons.

[quote="hpeebles, post:116, topic:28597"]
We could make every neuron have a permanent key which the controller can query for at any time (or maybe we’d need vetKeys so that the key never exists in the replica?) and which can be used when calling `manage_neuron` for any operation (it can’t be just for disburse for the reasons mentions in my previous post).

This way you can never fully trust a neuron which was previously owned by another user, destroying the demand for neuron markets.
[/quote]

This is an interesting idea, which I had not considered before. 
As you pointed out, for security reasons one would definitely need to encrypt the permanent keys via vetKeys (or a similar mechanism) so that a single replica does not have access to them. I will discuss further with the crypto experts to get their feedback. 

For the time being, I have one architecture feedback. If we were to implement such a key, (encrypted by vetKeys or a similar scheme), then it seems that the whole security of the NNS would be dependent on the applied encryption scheme.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-03-26 11:03:36 UTC | #178

Regarding the discussion on whether the PoK scheme would need to be applied to all non-II neurons or only newly created ones: I believe, as reflected in the proposal made above, that it would be sufficient to apply the scheme only to  neurons, created after a pre-defined cut-off date, with the following arguments:

* Non-II neurons established before the tECDSA feature's introduction are inherently non-transferable, as they cannot be controlled by a canister. Hence,  Implementing PoK for these neurons, which likely represent a significant portion of the voting power, would not enhance security. Instead, it would only impose an operational burden on its users.
* The focus then shifts to the relatively smaller group of non-II neurons created after tECDSA's launch, a fraction of which might be canister-controlled. Here, the case seems less clear-cut.  We proposed a solution that includes a definitive cut-off point aligned with the approval of a motion proposal introducing the new scheme so that users do not have to adapt in retrospect.

> a waiting period akin to Polkadot’s 28 days could be considered

This could be another option. Perhaps a transfer delay of ~1 month during which you can’t vote, or maybe it could vary according to the dissolve delay (VP).

It seems a good property to allow a neuron to be able to exit/enter the ‘full reward’ state (possibly repetitively), depending on whether it might be transfered (hot neuron) or not (cold neuron).
[/quote]

Thank you @dx111 and @Seers. I agree that a temporary loss of voting power, in case of a transfer, would be an an elegant solution. It would disincentivise actual transfers, but spare regular users from needing to take any specific actions.

However, there are also ways to circumvent such a scheme. For instance, if verification focuses solely on changes to a neuron's controller, one could establish a hierarchy where canister A controls canister B, which in turn controls a neuron. Consequently, selling canister A wouldn't directly alter the neuron's controller, effectively circumventing the intended safeguard. This could be further complicated by creating elaborate chains of control ("towers of canisters") or by manipulating the canister through an API and then transferring API access.

If you have further thoughts on how to prevent such circumventions, then I would be very much interested to hear them.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-03-26 12:20:13 UTC | #180

True, existing non II neurons are non-transferable already. 

However, existing non II neurons may want to transfer the controller of their neuron to a canister. Neuron holders may want to do this in order to upgrade their security to multisig rather than rely on seed phrases / encrypted PEM files which are difficult to manage, and subject to loss. Instead, using a canister they could then sign up for a service like Orbit. This will be possible to do if we let existing non II neurons have PoK. I do agree it shouldn’t be forced since there’s no requirement, and could create operational complexity if it’s unwanted, but adding this option would be tremendously valuable to those who want it.

You and @skilesare both make valid points that, unfortunately, would never see the light of day if a notable application running on the IC is suddenly made useless via a controversial NNS proposal. Developers and end users would lose confidence in the ecosystem. It’d be an issue of public relations.

Maybe revoking the PoK? or whatever we decide to use to make them non-transferable. I don't know if that's possible or if there is another primitive. I'm imagining something like:
* Everyone has a PoK.
* When you wish to make a transfer, you initiate a countdown to revoke the PoK.
* During this countdown, you are not allowed to vote.
* Once the PoK is revoked, the transfer is executed.
* If the recipient is an individual, they will generate a new PoK and continue voting.
* If the recipient is a marketplace, it will not generate a new PoK in order to remain liquid and will not have the ability to vote.

I don’t understand, in which category my neuron will be according to that? I created one of the neurons I have 4 months and another 8 months ago, I don’t really understand what you mean with “ canister controlled”

I created an internet identity, no ledger, just using the seed phrase, it’s mine on that category you mentioned that will be excluded for this disbursement key? You mention before and after “ TECDSA” you really think normal users will know at what point in time this was released and if now we are getting affected by that ? Just leave the neurons created by internet identity or ledger or whatever thing they decide to create it working AS USUAL, just affect the new ones created after the “motion” proposal if you wanna count with our votes.

Anyway as you said there are not many neurons created till
This point in time this neurons will not affect at all your main reasons for doing this proposal,

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-03-26 14:27:24 UTC | #185

Is not about exploits or no exploits, investors never were mentioned on official documentation their neurons couldn’t be sold, and that any dapps created for that purpose will be “exploiting” that. If I were mentioned I couldn’t sell my neuron because of a watermark on it and no one will
Buy it I didn’t lock it indefinitely, also my rewards will be affected, if someone decided to lock for all those years or “indefinitely” of course we are looking for our ROI based on rewards, and now this is affecting my investment plan. I just say one thing it’s better to leave this few neurons unaffected that anyway didn’t represent a huge threat according to what this proposal supposed to be, rather than sacrificing that probably the project will reduce in a huge % the demand for 8year locked neurons 7year 6 year etc… this will scared a lot of potential long term investors if they see what you are causing to us, the first early supportes.


I’m complaining BOTH for, I couldn’t be able to sell when it was NEVER mentioned a year back on the documentation, and the rewards will be reduced if I put non transferability over transferability. 

If i want neuron transferability I get WAY less rewards If I want my rewards PROMISED on our initial “DEAL”
With the protocol. And if I choose non transferability I get NORMAL rewards but with the watermark that means I cannot sell the neuron.

I believe this display only includes named neurons. I previously mentioned in both private discussions and on forums that I am seriously contemplating transforming one of my neurons associated with my company, which also operates a node, into a named neuron. I propose that all prominent holders ( or "whales" for lack of a better term) should be encouraged to name their neurons and engage more actively in voting.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-03-26 19:33:48 UTC | #187

The proposal doesn't affect your current neurons..just new ones after the import if passed and built.

Canister controlled means a smart contract can control a neuron..lots of cool applications, but smart contracts on the IC can change owners so it can become an isssue.

If it’s an option for existing neuron holders to add PoK, then it doesn’t need to affect them. They can choose to ignore it and not add PoK. 

The value in the option to add PoK gives existing neuron holders the ability to transfer ownership to a canister. But it would be merely an option, not an obligation.

-------------------------

GeekFactory | 2024-03-27 08:16:15 UTC | #193

Hello Community,

Below is the official view of GeekFactory on the current proposal.

We absolutely support lifting restrictions on canister control over neurons. This will simplify development and unlock new use cases. However, we question whether the idea of enhancing the long-term binding between neuron controllers and neurons is beneficial for the voting behavior, security of the Internet Computer or the future of the ecosystem. 

**1) Resource Allocation Concerns** 

Neurons tied to II in the NNS are only a fraction of the voting power. Neurons with substantial voting power are typically managed by alternative measures (DFX, Hardware wallet, Quill) and cannot be transferred. Furthermore, independent voting on Twitter suggests that people are more inclined to lock ICP long-term if there's a liquidity opportunity even at a significant **open market** discount. 

Given all of the above, why invest in new ways to restrict neuron transferability when the risks are minimal and the community leans towards flexibility? In addition, **this proposal is diverting the Foundation's limited development time and resources away from more critical matters**. It is essential to direct all efforts towards projects that offer greater benefits to ICP community.

**2) Proposal Segmentation** 

This proposal incorporates three different ideas into one which makes it hard to make a clear decision. We would like the community to analyze, discuss and vote on these ideas individually.

**3) Clarity on PoK Needed** 

It is not clear how Proof of Knowledge (PoK) will be implemented in this proposal. This could cause unexpected problems down the line. We believe PoK shouldn't be part of the proposal until everyone understands exactly how it will work.

**We hope this will help you to make your own informed decision.**

P.S. Responding to accusations of crossing lines, violating unwritten rules, and posing threats to the ecosystem. We always strive to develop solutions that meet the genuine needs of the ICP community, guided by direct feedback and active engagement with our users. We take pride in the overwhelmingly positive responses we've received from our community members. 

Thank you!

If we lose the ability to offer our nuerons on the market, significantly less people will be willing to stake for any amount of time. Having previously created nuerons "grandfather'ed in" isn't a cope either. Eventually those nuerons will be sold to their "final owner" and essentially ALL nuerons will be affected.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-03-27 10:25:12 UTC | #195

My 2cents on this relevant topic.

Divide the proposal in two, one for allowing canisters to control neurons, and the other for giving the concept of "owner" and how that is operated.
1) Think the first one is consensual and broadly needed.
2) The second one, definitely needs a lot more R&D time on it, my suggestions:
- Neurons are already complex, please don't make them Even more complex. Adding nuances like, is this a PoK neuron, a before or after motion date, an already created disbursement key, will make things significantly worse. Please let's avoid at all cost going this way. Whatever the change, I feel it should be implemented to all, and keep all neurons equal.
- The goal is to keep VP under control, maybe we can implement a tiered solution that does a 80:20 effect. Maybe we only need to force the "initial owner lock" system on 20% of the neurons, and we would already get the 80% VP locked as expected. We can allow smaller investors to have the desired flexibility, and selling at a discount on open market. I have the impression bigger neurons / VP need to do KYC, maybe we force the "owner lock" on them?
- Maybe we could do a snapshot of the current VP and all neurons higher than X, get "owner locked" (or "initial owner recoverable"), and all new neurons higher than Y (targeting DAOs) also automatically get the "owner locked".
- That way I feel pretty confident no significant VP (>33% or >51%) would end up in a neuron market.

Thanks for reading and thanks for this hard work. :muscle:

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-03-27 14:12:45 UTC | #196

I've made a number of philosophical and existential comments in this thread, so let me make one concrete and practical one:

**The @GeekFactory team are Internet Computer Heros.**

They've been building amazing tech for the IC and pushing the limits of the tech on a number of fronts.

Products like ID Geek are necessary to move the protocol forward and increase its anti-fragility. As they stated there is no immediate threat posed by their marketplace.

If any of my statements have come across as accusatory, I apologize and hope you'll give me some grace in trying to solve for far future problems that could threaten the network.

The ID market does enable some users of the platform to knowingly take undue wealth from the rest of the NNS.  In the same way, substantial steak knives enable some individuals to walk into their community bank and steal a million dollars, which through second-order effects takes wealth from everyone else if they get away with it. Theft is theft but I'm not blaming the bank for the flawed system.

Just like crypto offers some significant reduction in bank thefts with math(can't rob banks that don't exist), if there is a math solution here to make it impossible for people to steal from other members of the NNS, I hope we can have a rational conversation about it.

If our network has moral hazard or hidden volatility in it then we absolutely need teams like GeekFactory building tools like the II marketplace that ferret those problems out and let us build a healthy immune system for the network. 

Further to the root, this last bear market was pretty brutal on a lot of us and I imagine the marketplace actually provided far more "good" than "evil" on that front. Sometimes you have to keep a roof over your kid's head.

I had an interview yesterday with a DAO researcher and engineer from another community that is doing a lot of work in the conviction voting space. He had an amazing quote that hit me pretty hard since this debate has been on my mind.

He was discussing different voting methods and mentioned Velodrome which pioneered time-locked stake voting(in his eyes, he's unfamiliar with the IC). "When the price started going down, I saw so many friends hurt with nothing they could do. Things started getting nasty and governance broke down. I always wondered why you'd choose this system. It's like being abusive to your future self. Why would you choose a system that makes you do that to yourself?"

I don't have a great answer for him. So it's possible the long-term solution to this problem lies outside the entire scope of the current debate. Thus it certainly isn't worth hurting anyone or making inappropriate accusations and if I got too close to that line or if I've hurt any feelings it certainly wasn't my intent and again, I apologize.

Keep building.

IDGeek is a viable option to sell neurons and it gives the ICP retail investor peace of mind. The option to sell in case of a financial emergency. The only options to possibly remedy restriction of this may be the idea of creating two types of neurons. One where you can sell, and one where you cannot. This way, the investor gets the choice. With the ones you cannot sell, maybe give a bit more of an incentive, such as voting power, or interest earned. Option two would be to introduce an ICP cap. Neurons holding under 1000 ICP can be sold on the market. Anything over that cannot, but grandfather in those that are above that threshold if the neuron was created before this adopted proposal. Again, the point being to grant ICP holders the freedom of choice when investing.

I recently ran this poll on X (Twitter) and it got 31 votes and passed narrowly in favour of canister controlled neurons with a 20% reduction in voting power: https://twitter.com/rakeoff_app/status/1771532460788011046 

I do think I agree with this point regarding adding new complexity:

**I was thinking what if something simple is done** that says if a principal is self-authenticated it receives full voting power and if it is a canister principal it receives -20% voting power. This would impact none of the current neurons, have no new complexity and not impact any current dApps (IDGeek).

There is the problem of the tECDSA and HTTP outcall canisters - they would receive full VP as technically they are "self-authenticated", but I think those canisters are significantly more complex and use much more cycles than a direct canister controlled neuron (they require two HTTP outcalls for every request + tECDSA signing and a lot more code complexity). So I'd say many devs would just opt to create canister controlled neurons directly it would be much safer and easier for devs to code.

I think overall this solution achieves the goals of this proposal while also keeping current stakeholders happy? Any thoughts?

See:  https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597/52?u=skilesare

It's easy to not see it this way because the maturity minted is so large and a retail investor gets a tiny fraction.  It boils down to what we pay stakers for and what we get. If we pay you to stay committed and then you bail after we have paid you, that is generally called by lots of bad names. "But they have to take a reduced fee in the market" doesn't help because then the buyer of the neuron is getting the benefit of discounted ICP and we all still paid.

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-27 16:38:24 UTC | #201

The issue arises when these long-term commitments are sold, potentially giving the impression that the initial commitment can be easily discarded for personal gain, especially when such sales could result in benefits like discounted rates for the buyer, which seems to distribute the cost among the rest of us.

However, this perspective might miss an important potential upside. Allowing the sale of long-term neurons can actually enhance our ecosystem's dynamism and resilience. When stakeholders can sell their neurons, we're not just enabling a financial transaction; we're potentially trading passive holding for active participation. This is because the sale opens up the opportunity for these neurons to be acquired by individuals who are not just financially invested but are also willing to actively contribute to the ecosystem's governance and future direction. Thus, what initially appears as a loss in commitment could actually be a gain in engagement and involvement.

Moreover, while it's valid to be concerned about the immediate financial implications of such sales, including the aspect of discounted ICP for buyers, we should also consider the broader picture. The primary goal is to build an ecosystem that is not only robust but also inclusive and adaptive. Encouraging a more active and engaged community, even if it means navigating the complexities of neuron sales, can lead to a richer, more participatory ecosystem.

In conclusion, while the concerns about the potential for loss in value and commitment due to neuron sales are understandable, it's also crucial to recognize the opportunities such mechanisms offer. By fostering a marketplace of ideas and engagement, we can ensure that our ecosystem remains vibrant and forward-thinking, driven by stakeholders who are not only invested financially but are also committed to its long-term success and governance.
