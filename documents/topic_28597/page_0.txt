## TL;DR

The Internet Computer Protocol prevents canisters from directly controlling neurons, a measure intended to block neuron sales and ensure long-term thinking in voting behavior. However, these restrictions can be circumvented by a canister using threshold ECDSA (tECDSA) and HTTP outcalls.

This situation calls for a reassessment of these restrictions, potentially unlocking new use cases. In the event of relaxing these restrictions, enhancing the long-term binding between neuron controllers and neurons becomes crucial as this is beneficial for the voting behavior and security of the Internet Computer.

A recommended solution is to strengthen the bond between neuron controllers and neurons via Proof-of-Knowledge (PoK) of the cryptographic key through which the neuron is controlled. Users could be incentivized to participate in such a scheme by adjustments to the neuron’s voting power, and hence also voting rewards, with the aim to prevent the formation of a deep neuron market.

We warmly invite the community to share their feedback on the proposed approach.

## Background

**Restrictions on Neuron Control**
In the ICP network, neurons represent decision-making entities that participate in governance by voting on proposals. To ensure long-term thinking in voting behavior, control over neurons is restricted: Currently only so-called [self-authenticating principals](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Principal#Self-Authenticating_principal) can be set as the controller of a neuron, see code [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L1901). A self-authenticating principal is an entity that utilizes its own cryptographic key pair (consisting of a private and a public key) to authenticate itself. For example, a user relying on Internet Identity, Quill or a Ledger hardware wallet is of this kind. Canisters, which do not possess self-authenticating principals, are therefore excluded from directly controlling neurons.

**Reason for the Restrictions on Neuron Control**
The restriction is based on the requirement that neurons should not be sold - when canisters can control neurons directly, one can sell a neuron by selling the canister that controls it. It is considered important for neurons to be non-transferable/no-sellable because

* neurons should have an incentive to vote in the long-term interest of the Internet Computer and
* to avoid the possibility of attacks where an attacker acquires tokens only for a short amount of time, votes on a malicious proposal (e.g. transfer tokens) and then sells the neurons again. Similar types of attacks have been executed on DAOs in the past ([example](https://medium.com/immunefi/hack-analysis-beanstalk-governance-attack-april-2022-f42788fc821e)).

**Circumventing Restrictions on Neuron Control**
Despite these safeguards, there are a few ways to bypass the restrictions on neuron control:

* Threshold ECDSA ([tECDSA](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works/)): As canisters are able to control tECDSA keys, which are a feature of the Internet Computer Protocol, they can also sign ingress messages to the Internet Computer and thereby act as the controller of a neuron (making calls via HTTP to appear as ingress).
* Canister signatures: A canister can control a neuron through canister signatures, again making calls via HTTP to appear as ingress.

Furthermore, it is also possible to control a neuron via an Internet Identity (II) and [sell the II](https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.icp0.io).

Please note that the current abilities to circumvent neuron ownership & sell restrictions are not considered an immediate risk to the Internet Computer yet. A significant fraction of the total voting power of existing NNS neurons (including Seed & ECT neurons) is not controlled by canisters/II. Hence, a material part of the voting power of existing neurons cannot end up on the neuron market. Moreover, the transferability of II-controlled neurons poses a smaller concern, typically affecting only smaller neurons.

## Revisiting Neuron Control Restrictions

Given that the restriction for canisters to not control neurons can be circumvented relatively easily, it should be considered to drop that restriction. This was suggested by several community members already. Lifting that restriction would bring the following benefits

* Facilitate NNS neurons that are SNS controlled: SNSs already chose to do this (e.g. OpenChat) or plan to do it (e.g. GoldDAO), providing them a continuous income to cover cycles fees and involving SNSs in NNS governance. Allowing this behavior more directly would simplify the current more complicated workflow via tECDSA.
* Consistency with SNS: As opposed to the NNS, the SNS framework does not apply restrictions on neuron controllers.
* Facilitate organizational neuron ownership: An organization could control a neuron via a canister.

## Ideas for the way forward

Acknowledging the potential for circumvention, we recommend to lift the restrictions on canister neuron control while still encouraging the core principle of non-transferability to safeguard the Internet Computer's security. A promising approach involves introducing a neuron attribute that significantly tightens the link between a neuron and its initial controller, making it more risky to sell a neuron and thus practically re-establishing the non-transferability of the original design.

**Enhancing Controller-Neuron Binding**
To strengthen this connection, we propose linking neuron control explicitly to a unique cryptographic key, known to the owner. If as a private user you know the private key, then you cannot un-know it and hence you keep the control even if the controllership is transferred. A practical method to achieve this enduring bond is through a Proof-of-Knowledge (PoK) of the controller's private cryptographic key. To counteract potential workarounds via threshold ECDSA (tECDSA) or threshold BLS (tBLS), an interactive Schnorr PoK, inherently incompatible with these protocols, is suggested.

**Incentivization Structure for Enhanced Controller-Neuron Binding**
The overall objective of the incentive structure is to deter the creation of a deep market for neurons. This is intended to make it difficult for an attacker to amass a significant amount of neurons quickly, exercise voting power in a harmful way, and then dispose of the neurons with minimal financial loss.

To further this objective, neurons without the enhanced controller-neuron binding via PoK could receive lower voting power and, consequently, lower rewards. Specifically, neurons without this binding, such as those controlled by canisters, could face a voting power reduction of up to 20%, depending on their dissolve delay. This reduction would range from 0% for neurons with no dissolve delay to 20% for those with an eight-year dissolve delay, applying linear interpolation for periods in between. The motivation for this time-dependence is to encourage non-transferability in particular for neurons with long dissolve delays and thus longer commitment to the network. The maximum reduction (in this instance, 20%) could be a parameter subject to modification through an NNS (Network Nervous System) vote.

In order to prevent creating a counterproductive incentive for neuron dissolution among existing neuron holders and to honor the commitment of current neuron holders, it is suggested that the voting power reduction for non-PoK neurons would only apply after a to be defined cut-off date (assuming that this proposal would be approved via a motion proposal one could for example use the approval date of the motion proposal). Instead of reducing the voting power for PoK-non-compliant neurons, an alternative could be to increase the voting power for PoK-compliant neurons. This change would essentially yield the same overall impact. Yet, as PoK-compliant neurons are expected to become the norm, the approach of decreasing voting power for non-PoK neurons appears more logical.

**Application Across Types of Neuron Control**
* New User-Controlled Neurons via Quill/Ledger hardware wallets: Eligible for the PoK scheme, reinforcing user ownership.
* New Canister-Controlled Neurons (both directly controlled by canister or through threshold ECDSA or canister signatures): Ineligible for PoK, aligning with the proposed restrictions lifting.
* New User-Controlled Neurons via Identity Identity (II): Due to BLS reliance, these neurons cannot participate in the PoK scheme directly. An alternative might involve assigning a non-modifiable "disbursement key," enhancing rewards while introducing a mechanism that complicates neuron transfer, thus indirectly bolstering non-transferability. A disbursement key works as follows: If you know the disbursement key (and the neuron id) of the II controlled neuron then you would able to disburse to a specified account (using a new kind of neuron operation).  This key, once set, cannot be changed. Knowing the key is irreversible, creates a risk for buyers: the previous owner could potentially access the neuron’s ICP in the future.

## Suggested Phased Implementation

To effectively transition to the new framework a phased roll-out is proposed.

1. Phase 1 (soon): Lift restrictions on canister control over neurons.
2. Phase 2 (next): Adjust the voting power. New neurons lacking a self-authenticating principal will receive reduced voting power and rewards.
3. Phase 3 (mid-term): Introduce the additional PoK described above (and a disbursement key of neurons controlled via II). Lower rewards would apply to all new neurons without this additional PoK (or disbursement key).

I totally agree that we should lift the restrictions of canister-controlled neurons, as it's technically possible to do it.

I don't think we should penalize canister-controlled neurons, because then it would probably circle back to more brittle workarounds.

If we ever have Schnorr Threshold Signatures, would it be possible to generate this PoK?

In this situation, transferring votes, including through 'Known Neurons', should not be possible. The issue of buying votes renders the acquisition of neurons for voting redundant. While still theoretical, the problem of vote transferring poses a more serious threat than the hypothetical situation of buying neurons to sway voting outcomes. This discussion is relevant only if we are genuinely concerned about conducting proper voting.

Moreover, transferring votes is a much more serious issue than the hypothetical scenario of purchasing neurons to tip the scales in voting. Again, this all makes sense if we are truly talking about fair voting.

And yes, before one can purchase locked neurons, they must possess a sufficient amount of ICP. What is the current ratio of ICP in the market versus ICP in neurons?

NNS, Internet Identity, Staking, and Neuron are already OVER complicated for users. And now we're making it even more complicated; users are already avoiding DFinity! One of the good things about Internet Identity is the ability to connect multiple keys and manage them. If a key is lost or something happens, you delete it, buy a new one, and register it. This approach was a major plus and solved many problems, including losing access to your wallet. But with this new key/entry introduction in the neuron, we're bringing back the problem. If I understand correctly, will it not be possible to change the newly introduced key/entry in the neuron?

-------------------------

Jam | 2024-03-19 08:57:12 UTC | #7

For my initial reaction, I feel that DFINITY may be focusing on the wrong areas. I believe the effort used to write this post could be better allocated to core development, instead of pursuing less impactful endeavors.

My second point, more constructive, concerns the apparent penalization of genuinely decentralized alternative staking platforms built on the IC. In the mid-term, this approach seems to penalize true decentralized staking via Internet Identity (II), arguably the best authentication tool available. Meanwhile, increased rewards are being directed to ledger-controlled neurons, even though recent governance decisions have highlighted the ledger's centralization issues.

Lastly, I advocate for an approach similar to that of SNS neurons. Regardless of whether it's a mid-term or long-term strategy, all neurons should be transferable by design. The argument that purchasing neurons directly equates to buying voting power is overly simplistic. There's a known case of a neuron accumulating approximately 10% of followee voting power without any financial expenditure or disclosing its neuron stake. Acquiring such a stake on the market would cost hundreds of millions and take years in the current climate. A vibrant neuron market could potentially stabilize or even increase value, with neurons possibly being sold at a premium rather than a discount. Furthermore, controlling 10% is unlikely to enable attacks in most scenarios.

Given these points, I strongly oppose the current strategy and encourage a reconsideration towards more decentralized, equitable approaches. Let's not undermine what's already complex.

If we're talking about the integrity of voting, I would touch upon and return to the topic of voting transparency. Currently, there's still no complete list of all neurons, something that has been much discussed. There's no way to know how following works, who is following whom. How the voting process works, which neurons voted on their own, which neurons voted automatically through the functionality of following other neurons, and which neurons are followed to see their entire voting behavior. Right now, it's a black box; why not open it up... provide all the information and make the network more open?

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-19 09:05:12 UTC | #9

We are changing and trying to improve the system, but we do not understand how this system currently works; there's no full transparency. In the case of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and true blockchains - data in the blockchain is available to ALL. Here, it's the opposite.

-------------------------

Jam | 2024-03-19 09:09:37 UTC | #10

The original post has the answer. 

> A significant fraction of the total voting power of existing NNS neurons (including Seed & ECT neurons) is not controlled by canisters/II

Now they want to give even more power and more rewards to those neurons. 

Read it again. Staking with a ledger (3rd party) is better than staking with Internet Identity (native).

@Jam I want to make sure we're on the same page: The idea is that also newly created II-controlled neurons could benefit from full rewards by using a disbursement key (see Section 'Applications Across Types of Neuron Control').   Existing II-controlled neurons would anyway receive full rewards due to the suggested cut-off date.

I was referring to a phased implementation where additional PoK will be introduced mid-term in the 3rd phase, after the voting power has already been reduced in the 2nd phase.

I have a different view on this point.

* When users lock their ICP in a neuron, it motivates them to vote in ways that benefit the Internet Computer’s long-term interests. 
* If a user chooses to delegate their voting power to another neuron, the responsibility lies with them to do their research and select a neuron that they believe will vote in alignment with their preferences for the Internet Computer’s long-term interests. 
* The delegation model, therefore, does not inherently pose more risk than direct voting, provided that users are diligent in selecting neurons to delegate to. This assumes that both in delegating and in direct voting, decisions are made with careful consideration of the Internet Computer’s long-term interests.

What criteria are used to define "new neurons"? All neurons that do not have a Self-Authenticating principal should be targeted. However, before that, please clarify the information on all neurons. It's unclear how this change would affect the distribution of voting power.

I have sympathy and understand the rationale for this request for making the voting behaviour of all NNS neurons public. On the other hand, I would also consider it to be a legitimate view to favor secrecy in voting, protecting the privacy of voters. This issue opens up a wider debate that probably goes beyond the scope of this post.

I believe this way, you are entitled to think differently, and someone else has their own opinion. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Statistics and an open voting system, regarding who votes directly or through a following mechanism, would clarify things. For example, I risk my assets in a neuron and choose, in my opinion, a reliable neuron to follow. There are many like me, and eventually, this very neuron, which may have only a few hundred ICP behind it, represents thousands of neurons with millions of ICP, and this very neuron doesn't even know about the responsibility of these millions of ICP! And one day, it receives a profitable offer to vote differently this time. It will risk its 100 ICP but sell its vote very profitably! Why not? Since we're discussing the possibility of buying a huge number of neurons from the market for voting. Ultimately, users will give their votes to other neurons, which in turn have a lower risk, and their vote can be bought out.

By the way, I like the first phase. It has the same functionality as it is now with SNS neurons. However, the second and third phases are counterproductive, and there are many other things much more important to the community and ecosystem. After several years, we still do not have a wallet! It is mind-blowing.

Thanks for creating this forum thread and I enjoyed reading the proposed solution.

I have been building https://rakeoff.io/, which is probably one of the main alternative staking applications on ICP outside of the NNS. From the beginning, I wanted to have a canister controlled neuron for Rakeoff, but the self-authenticated principal restriction stopped me. 

A few months ago I seen it was possible with ECDSA and HTTP outcalls so I decided to focus my efforts on building a canister in Motoko that controls a neuron - those efforts were successful and this neuron is owned and controlled by a Motoko canister: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/15836007478619123946.

So, having wrote a lot of custom code and built a canister to control a neuron in Motoko I wanted share my experience and thoughts.

Creating a canister controlled neuron proved to be very laborious - mostly due to the whole thing just being a workaround for the self-authenticated principal restriction, It resulted in hundreds if not thousands more lines of code (deep dives into cbor, candid and DER encodings and many other things). However, If I can figure it out - I think many others can too and that left me with the main question - why is this restriction here? The current self-authenticated principal restriction should really be renamed "A principal derived from a user or a dev who has spent many hours debugging and figuring out how to create a canister that pretends to be a user". I'll coin it - "dev-authenticated principal" :smile:

The path I see forward is either approving this proposal and opening the doors in a safe and well thought out way (shoutout to @bjoernek &  @bjoern ) or creating a different proposal to stop the current ECDSA and HTTP outcall neurons. I think the second option is not a viable option as DAOs like OpenChat already have large neurons staked via this way and it would probably create some breaking changes with many canisters.

So really, I see no option other than moving forward with this proposal and removing the restriction. It really won't change much (from what is currently technically possible) other than giving dev's an easier time coding staking dApps on ICP (which I'm happy about).

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-19 13:07:35 UTC | #22

I believe that the first part should have been implemented a long time ago, with functionality similar to how SNS neurons and their management are done. What about phase 2 and phase 3? Am I correct in understanding that the yield on neurons controlled via a canister will always be lower than neurons with PoK, or am I misunderstanding something? And the main question - why will Dfinity decide how I can manage my funds invested in the neuron. Why can't I sell it, transfer it as an inheritance, or do something else if necessary?

-------------------------

Jam | 2024-03-19 13:07:48 UTC | #23

To ensure we're on the same page, I want to clarify that I'm not opposed to canisters controlling neurons. My objection is to the added complexity in calculating voting power and to the proposed solution that results in some neurons being more advantageous than others. Neurons should be considered equal if they have the same dissolve delay, stake, and age. I am firmly against any system where neurons created before a certain date or through a specific method, device, etc., are given an advantage.

In essence, we're looking at multiple proposals bundled into one:

1. Canisters should have the option to control neurons. – I agree.
2. Neurons created with a ledger should be considered superior to those created with Internet Identity (II) or by a canister. – I strongly disagree.
3. Neurons created before a specific date should be given preferential treatment over those created after. – I strongly disagree

[/quote]

If neurons are transferable by design you break the fundamental "skin in the game" assumption of the NNS and we will need a new security model. By definition, you make (far) shorter-term decisions if there is an exit possibility before your unlock, even at a discount.

-------------------------

Jam | 2024-03-19 13:38:33 UTC | #26

That's why I think of this as a mid- or long-term strategy; it requires careful evaluation, but it shouldn't be taboo, because it was initially made like this. And neurons or voting power are transferable. It's just not secure, nor trustless, and has a lot of friction and workarounds.

Now we understand that it is possible for a canister to hold a neuron via a workaround. The proposal is to remove the workaround. And I assume someday we can remove the workaround of transferring/selling neurons as well and make the process secure and trustless.

But returning to the proposal:
On one hand, the proposal presents an improvement, such as enabling canister-controlled neurons, which paves the way for correctly implemented liquid staking and smart wallets (canister wallets) capable of holding staked ICP. However, the proposal immediately penalizes these initiatives with a 20% decrease in rewards. It just doesn't make any sense.

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-19 13:48:07 UTC | #27

Once again, this is just your opinion, unsupported by any evidence. Personally, I disagree. In fact, I did the opposite by staking for 8 years without dissolving, solely because there's an opportunity to exit in case of extreme necessity. Without such an option, I probably wouldn't have committed to a maximum stake. This is purely my opinion, too. Moreover, this stance does not compel me to make short-term decisions.

Looking at the recent voting chart, what do we actually see? I notice 10-15 significant rises, leading me to believe that up to 20 neurons with significant voting power either directly or through following, make decisions. There's no decentralization. Today, 15! It may not be the case, but the opposite can't be disproved due to the lack of transparency! And this issue of locking neurons from being transferred or sold is not addressed at all!

@bjoernek  I've wanted this restriction lifted for a while now and I appreciate you putting this proposal forward. I'm not a fan of implementing a PoK just for the sake of distinguishing between a traditional private key and a threshold private key but I can accept that as our plan if it means we can move forward with lifting the restriction in the meantime.

I don't think it needs evidence. It is math. It only takes one sub-optimal decision to make fully optimal never achievable.  I'm happy to be convinced otherwise, and I admit that serendipity and luck likely play a long term role in where we end up but our network governance shouldn't be based on "hopefully we get lucky". We have to make the best possible long term choice for the network at every juncture with the info we have.

I don't mean this in any mean or nasty way, but in a definitional way in game theory: you are an adversary to the network. Your stake is a false signal to the those that the network is secure. We do not want a network we're you have an opportunity exit in any case. It is the only way to maintain the optimal prisoners dilemma result.

Network dynamics and the hurdles this network will face are extreme in their volatility and predictability. A small external occurrence can may your 'extreme necessity' the common rule.

Bluntly, we don't want your maximum stake because your would consider exiting under some condition. Your stake is a drag on the network achieving its best longterm choice in each vote. In fact, your non-reliable stake steals maturity from others that won't exit. There is a case that it is theft from the network and it's securers.

I can give that in most expected instances you may feel this is true, but I'm worried about the ones you don't expect.  Any ability to exit provides a discount on the risk of a possible network action.  Either we are all locked in the room together with a demand on solving a problem(the room is on fire) or there is a 10% chance that each can get out resulting in 10 lucky out of a hundred stealing life from the others when some number run for the exit instead of facing the network adversity.

In this chart below, there are 10 main points that influenced the decision of this vote. It's hard for me to imagine that tens of thousands of neurons currently in the network just randomly distributed themselves across these points. What I see is that these points are either neurons with a significant amount of weight or other neurons following them through the follow mechanism. And it looks on the chart as if just 10! "NEURONS" made the decision. There's no even distribution of votes. Maybe I'm wrong, but we are lacking transparency.

After having gone through all the trouble to create a DAO-controlled neuron feature (using tECDSA signed HTTPS outcalls) for [@Personal_DAO](https://twitter.com/Personal_DAO)'s, I can testify that the cat is out of the bag with respect to canister controlled neurons. Especially considering that Personal DAOs are built to repeatedly deployed as standalone, commoditized applications. @skilesare I understand your reasoning for not wanting transferability of neurons, but its already available and will become widely available for the end user soon. And to make any attempts to remove that capability would have large negative consequences for the ecosystem now that so many projects have already incorporated canister-controlled neuron functionality into their codebase and business models. 

The best thing to do to address the security concerns at this point would be to persuade stakers to stake via non-transferrable neurons via some incentive structure. a PoK neuron system in which PoK-compliant neurons are rewarded at higher rates than non-compliant neurons is the only recommendation I've heard thus far that provides that incentive structure. I'm open to hearing more though.

skilesare | 2024-03-19 14:56:14 UTC | #34

Ahh...I get it ...yes. More transparency here would be great. Also, the ability to change your vote if you don't like what your delegate did would be nice from a responsibility, regulatory, and "cooling the temperatures" of public debate.

It would let known neurons vote early and engage in debate, but would slow the execution of items as an absolute active majority would be required to execute early.  This might need to be topic sensitive and maybe just apply to the newer "critical" proposals.

I'm not in any way against the canister control, I'm against transferability.

My suggestion is that this "penalty" for not having a PoK be waived for known neurons that dox themselves.  Maybe they don't even need to be known neurons in the NNS sense, but providing evidence that you are a canister controlled neuron and that the controller will not change(a change in controller would auto ban the neuron from this proposed dox list.)

If you are building a service where one controller has theoretically control over many neurons that people think they have staked securely, I'd say this is a massive security risk and should be a red flag to anyone using that service unless the controller is significantly decentralized and capitalized to avoid takeovers.(not saying this is the case with your service, but this config occurred to me and it seems worth mentioning)

It seems a bit strange that something like the OpenChat neuron would be penalized when we all know who it is and that it has a sufficient level of decentralization that reasonably guards against  takeover.

I guess in theory I'd be in favor of a system that required either PoK or canister doxing with controller commitment.

Maybe even services like gitcoin passport could be used to ensure that it is very very difficult to transfer ownership.

Thank you for initiating this discussion, Bjoern. Here are my thoughts:

* I support lifting restrictions on canister control over neurons.
* However, I am unsure about the implementation of the remaining phases.

My main reasons are as follows:

* The proposal seems complex, adding to what is already a complicated process for the average user.
* I fail to see the risk in removing the restriction. But perhaps this is rooted in my belief that the majority of stakeholders possess the capacity to prioritize their long-term interests over short-term gains.

After reviewing all the comments, I've arrived at the following conclusion. PoK will only be necessary for new neurons to obtain the maximum reward, but it remains an OPTIONAL measure for users to apply PoK to old neurons as well. This implies that potentially PoK could apply to ALL neurons. Given that there's no way to verify whether a neuron has PoK, we must assume that all neurons possess PoK. This effectively stifles the inception of any DeFi activities involving neurons. It will not be possible to collateralize, sell, or perform any actions with a neuron. It will merely lie dormant, serving only for voting purposes. This is a crucial point, and I want us all to understand the implications of this, not just the removal of restrictions in the first phase. As we know, DeFi is currently a sore point of the ecosystem, which is almost nonexistent, and DFINITY is losing out to other ecosystems in this regard. What little we have, we're destroying and hindering further.

As I said before  I strongly disagree on the Phase 2 and 3!

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-03-20 07:28:31 UTC | #39

Canister controlled neurons have been requested by the eco-system for a long time and I see PoK as a solid option if it let's us achieve this. What other solution would you propose?

Is your main problem that you can't sell your neuron? If so, I think that is the point and it was never intended in the design to be able to sell neurons. I don't see this as limiting DeFi in any way - I believe with canister controlled neurons we would see many new types of applications appear with really interesting use-cases.

The current way to sell neurons is by selling your internet identity? If releasing PoK gives us canister controlled neurons and removes the ability to sell neurons via internet identity - I think the final outcome would be more steadfast voters and new DeFi staking applications (obviously that's just an assumption based on the proposed solution).

I don't understand why we need PoK to achieve this. It seems like a good initiative—removing the workaround for canisters controlling neurons—while at the same time adding some unnecessary complexity and penalizing some neurons. Why can't we simply allow canisters to control neurons, period?

I agree. That would pose a security risk that couldn’t sustain a resilient ecosystem. 

Having a way for DAO controllers to exercise selectivity and discernment of who is allowed to participate in the governance of the digital service that they share was something that was considered and accounted for.

The result is a system in which control of the neuron is determined proportionally to how much each Principal has contributed to that neuron.

The discussion surrounding the non-transferability of neurons within the ICP ecosystem raises important considerations that deserves a comprehensive review. The intent behind fostering long-term commitment and decision-making is important; however, several aspects could be addressed:

1. Governance Dynamics
Assuming neuron holders will maintain indefinite interest or capability in governance overlooks inevitable life changes and mortality. Humans are not immortal, and our ability to contribute to projects like the ICP is naturally finite. Transferability ensures governance remains dynamic, passing the responsibility to those currently engaged and capable of steering the protocol's future when others are no longer able to contribute.

2. Fairness and Motivation
The notion of being "imprisoned" might be effective for achieving a definite task with a clear target, having such lockup for a broader governance context—requiring evolving goals and long-term engagement—might be highly demotivating. Participants' influence is waning as they begin to dissolve their neuron, which highlights the need for a system that allows stakeholders to exit on their own terms. Possibility to sell the neuron recognizes their contributions without making them dependent on the governance outcomes decided by the remaining participants, especially when they have to wait for 8 years.

3. Long-Term vs. Short-Term
The assumption that non-transferable neurons inherently lead to better long-term decision-making overlooks the complexity of predicting the impact of current proposals. While emphasizing the importance of the long term by locking users into their decisions may seem like a way to protect the protocol's future, it does not shield the protocol from harmful and damaging impacts in the short term.

4. Coordination Risks
Relying solely on non-transferability to safeguard against malicious actors ignores the potential for influence through non-financial means, such as accumulating followership for coordinated governance attacks. This approach does not fully protect the protocol from all forms of manipulative behavior.

5. Market Dynamics
The existence of a market for Internet Identity (II) and the observed behaviors around neuron transferability indicate a natural demand for flexibility in participation rights. A healthy, free market could incentivize constructive contributions to the protocol's success, as the value of participants' stakes is inherently tied to the ICP's overall prosperity, future potential, and neuron attractiveness for potential buyers.

I would add here. **All neurons should be equal.** We already take into account dissolve delay, stake, and age, which are more than enough. Today, we are discussing penalizing neurons created using a canister, for example, for liquid staking or within canister-wallets; what's next, penalizing individual neurons that the majority dislikes? That's a path leading nowhere.

-------------------------

Seers | 2024-03-20 13:16:22 UTC | #46

I believe the primary challenge is understanding the impact on security when transferring a neuron. In my opinion, the effect is minimal, given that any neuron transfer requires a buyer.

The example provided seems a bit extreme because it involves a flash loan. However, this particular issue can be mitigated by simply delaying the execution. I expect that most stakeholders will avoid markets that could potentially concentrate power and act maliciously.

Lastly, the option to exit a DAO is particularly appealing to me, reminiscent of the Moloch DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem.

[/quote]

I see a few options:

1. The NNS. I'm not in favor of giving more and more responsibility to the NNS, but it is a logical and most obvious point to put the list.  Especially given the code that actually awards neurons. Having the canonical list on the same canister reduces the cost of the calculation significantly and reduces integration costs.

2. A purpose-built SNS.  Handing control of the list over to an SNS where people can engage by buying the token that secures the list and are rewarded with a) forfeited ICP of those that violate the smart contract(maybe...I don't like sticks when carrots will do). b) inflation c) some reward from the NNS for helping further secure the network(we do it for nodes, why not other forms of security. negative is more inflation...needs to be worth it)

3. Some kind of permissionless system.  If you can permissionless apply the binding of the controller to your canister, that is sufficient for people that are 1. doxed and can later prove they own the neruon (perhaps we have an ICRC standard with function that must be called monthly by a PoK principal that is the controller?) 2. Can prove it is an SNS.(Maybe SNS need a flag called 'sufficiently decentralized' that the NNS can manage. For example (unless the dragginz team has divested significantly I'd consider that to be a 'not sufficiently decentralized SNS.  @bjoernek Would a canister controlled solely by a principal that had PoK and that was 'bound' to that controller be considered equivalent to a principal with PoK?

I prefer permissionless if possible.

The main concern, as I understand it, is highlighted here:
https://twitter.com/_GeekFactory/status/1770427914036867580

There are three proposals cleverly concealed behind the enticing headline 'let's enable canisters to control neurons', which is where the majority might stop reading. However, it goes on to suggest penalizing neurons controlled by canisters with 20% decrease in rewards (and even proposing mid-term penalties for new neurons controlled by II). Following this, there's a vague mention of 'introducing some PoK tech stuff' that's not clearly explained and likely eliminates the secure transfer of neurons at all.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2024-03-20 13:38:16 UTC | #50

I read the proposal and while I acknowledge the voting power reduction I didn’t see anything that would prevent the transfer of neurons through II. 


[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:28597"]
In order to prevent creating a counterproductive incentive for neuron dissolution among existing neuron holders and to honor the commitment of current neuron holders, it is suggested that the voting power reduction for non-PoK neurons would only apply after a to be defined cut-off date (assuming that this proposal would be approved via a motion proposal one could for example use the approval date of the motion proposal)
[/quote]

This would seem to protect existing neurons from the PoK penalty.

Yes that is correct!

Furthermore (since you asked about II controlled neurons), for newly created II controlled neurons, we had suggested the following: "Due to BLS reliance, these neurons cannot participate in the PoK scheme directly. An alternative might involve assigning a non-modifiable “disbursement key,” enhancing rewards while introducing a mechanism that complicates neuron transfer, thus indirectly bolstering non-transferability."

Hence the idea is that also newly created II neurons, can receive full rewards, subject to usage of a disbursement key (or a similar mechanism).

[quote="Jam, post:45, topic:28597"]
what’s next, penalizing individual neurons that the majority dislikes
[/quote]

As a thought exercise(I've made some assumptions to set a hard right edge of a gradient...this is not a realistic scenario, but is on a gradient that we are experiencing now with ID marketplaces):  

A VC Neuron of 50,000,000 ICP and locked for 8 years votes with significant voting power for 2 years.  Let's say the rate of maturity is 14%(28% because locked for 8 years) for those two years to simplify the thought experiment. So the NNS(all of us) pay this VC neuron 28,000,000 ICP over two years assuming they don't reinvest because, our assumption is, that they are securing the network by voting in the network's best interests for at least the next 8 years(the deal they made with the NNS in forming the neuron with an 8 year lock).

After this two-year period, we discover that they have sold the ID securing their neuron to a third party for 40,000,000 ICP.  As a net, they have profited 18,000,000 ICP. Further, we learn that the contract for this sale was signed before they created the neuron.  Not only have they not been voting for the long-term health of the network that they signed up for, but they have also knowingly been voting for a specific horizon of 2 years.  If they had only staked for 2 years they may still have profited by about 600,000 ICP.  So the NNS overpaid for the security they actually provided by 17.4M ICP.

In any rational legal system, evidence that you signed a contract with party A and a conflicting contract with contract B would constitute a fairly straightforward conviction of fraud and hard damages of at least 17.4M ICP and potentially more if there is some evidence that the VC manipulated the price to be optimized when they liquidated at the cost of price further down the line.  Additional damages would likely be recovered from the third party that enabled the fraud.

This is clear and explicit fraud if these were contracts.  Of course, we don't have contracts, we have code. And code is law.  But I'd say that if your code enables this kind of clear common-law fraud you're pretty doomed and the network has some responsibility to keep this from occurring.  Can this behavior be dissuaded via code? Maybe? Does it make the system too complicated?  Maybe?  Would punitive damages work?  It wouldn't do much good to penalize the VC after the fact because they've liquidated their assets and likely moved them elsewhere.  Can we dissuade it by being putative to anyone who enables the fraud against the NNS?  Freezing, locking, or burning neurons that can be proved to have been connected to a sale would probably persuade most to not buy neurons.  Probably not everyone, but certainly most people who want to de-risk neuron ownership. This punitive action is likely the left edge of a "what to do about it" gradient of action.  So if you want to stay in the 'do nothing to the code camp' and want to have a network that doesn't enable simple methods of fraud against the participants, then yes, penalizing individual neurons is likely the most direct way to keep this fraud from happening.

Now the participants in neuron marketplaces are not as far to the right as our VC in obvious fraud, but they are on the gradient. The sellers are committing a form of fraud against the rest of the NNS for their own gain and the people buying those neurons are enabling the fraud.  We might say in some cases where someone gets cancer or has some harrowing emergency that we'll give a humanitarian dispensation but it doesn't eliminate the fact that if that neuron keeps voting after they know they'll have to liquidate that they are defrauding the network of ICP that they are not due according to the 'spirit of the code.' Same with people who 'always had the best intention of the network at heart' but decided one day to sell. If they keep voting after that date then the fraud begins..

So what do we do about it? 1. let's make that not possible or 2. change the contract or 3. change the form of security.

1. Not possible: An ideal solution doesn't involve punitive action but makes the fraud not possible.  I don't want punitive action and I don't want a network that regularly has to do anything like freezing or confiscating funds. That leaves us with a requirement to change the code and behavior of our network.  PoK for individuals and While List for known organizational neurons seems like a good path forward to me.  I think the penalty for not being in one of these camps is not a 20% penalty, but maybe a more significant restriction like you can only vote on X topics(see 2.)

2. Chage the contract.  A few options: a) You can bail on ETH stake at any time because the security it provides is temporal. The thing you are voting on has no long-term effect.  The epochs are either endorsed or not. The IC has a ton of things like this that we(have) voted on like exchange rates that expire after a few minutes, node reward payouts that once paid are paid....but we also have a ton of things that have no temporal end. If you vote to add a node to the network that node is going to be active for a long time. In order to endure the market effects of that decision may take a while.  If the things we choose to vote on had terms and your stake was locked until those things' terms expired, it would make people more selective in what they vote on.  And if you only vote on short-term temporal things then you can exit in short order.  This is unfortunately complicated and you lose the simple narrative of 8 years = 18%.

3. Change the form of security: A much bigger discussion that should likely only be engaged if we find that the fundamental assumptions of the NNS begin to fail or create excessive risk.

I'm open to arguments that my thought exercise is flawed in some way, so if you see a flaw, please say something. Giving canisters the right to hold neurons is I think super important and I agree that we're no under some immediate threat to network security, but over the long term I do believe these kinds of situations will occur(or others that we can't think of now) and we should begin making plans now, if for no other reason then someone thinks they can fund an organization with X% rewards and then it all changes and the end up getting X-Y% that is unviable.

I think this is worth clarifying: The proposal suggests to incentivise non-transferability of newly created neurons, by allocating higher rewards to those with an enhanced binding between neuron and neuron controller.  A transfer of a neuron without this enhanced binding would be possible (for example by selling a canister who controls the neuron, or by selling an II which has no disbursement key).

Sorry, I'm confused. It seems you're combining two issues in one statement (not to mention bundling three proposals into one). Does this mean all new neurons will be non-transferable by default?

No. Canister controlled neurons would be effectively transferable (because you can sell the controlling canister) and II-controlled neurons would still be effectively transferable (because you can sell the II). However, if you choose for a newly created II-controlled neuron to add a disbursement key (so that you get higher rewards), then it would become much less attractive to buy that neuron, as the seller would still know the disbursement key even after selling it.

I agree that it should be dynamic. Not to bring up a sore subject, but regular confirmation of delegates(every X months you need to log in and confirm your following to continue passive voting) is a much better solution to this than letting people sell.  If you die or become disinterested your influence is removed at regular intervals.

Of course, you don't know the future, but you should be doing a risk calculation as to whether the reward is worth the commitment.  Don't stake for 8 years if your risk factor over that time period can't endure it. Sometimes you'll calculate wrong, but that is like any form of capital.

I disagree with most of point 2 as the system proportionally decreases your influence as you have less to gain and are closer to exit by design. I'm not sure why we want to subvert that fundamental assumption or why we would assume that the system would continue to work as designed with that subversion in place.  Not being able to exit on your own terms is the whole point. You exit on the market's terms after incorporating the decisions you helped make and that protects the system.

Either planning and logical thought have relevance to the future of the network or it doesn't. If we think that pure randomness will lead us to the same results then the system is a waste of time.

Of course, our plans can be wrong and sometimes the opposite choice would have been better in hindsight, but we're either governing or not.

If they had only staked for 2 years they may still have profited by about 600,000 ICP. So the NNS overpaid for the security they actually provided by 17.4M ICP.
[/quote]

Honestly, I would love to see a more realistic example than this one or the original. But here are a few random/non-so-serious thoughts:
- The example mostly feels like a market failure. Why couldn't the buyer purchase it originally, and has to instead purchase it later more expensive? 
- The NNS might (currently) overpay because there is no market to set the rewards; they are fixed. I think some people adjust the rewards based on staking percentage (not sure if this works). 
- It almost feels like an argument for having the possibility to lock a neuron forever (looking forward to **∞**-years gang). Otherwise, we are all making decisions based on "just" an 8-year timeframe and that feels wrong (?).

We could implement straightforward constraints, such as limiting the total number of neurons transferred to only 1% of the daily quota. If this threshold is exceeded, the excess will be deferred to the following day.

The governance canister would need to distinguish between II-controlled neurons with vs without disbursement key. If required, this information could also be exposed via a public API.

Furthermore, once the feature is implemented and all three phases are completed, could the same ‘disbursement key’ optionally be applied to all neurons, not just the new ones, under II control?

The suggestion is to use the disbursement key only for newly created II-controlled neurons. For Quill/Ledger controlled neurons, one could use the suggested PoK to proof the non-transferability.

This assumes that the goal is to avoid a hostile takeover via transfers.  I think the far more insidious threat to the network is non-optimized decision-making on a daily basis by those with a subconscious knowledge that they have a way to exist.  This does not address that threat.

It would be nice if the disbursement key would also work with a canister-controlled neuron (so that these neurons could also make a choice in the trade-off between transferability vs higher rewards). However, this does not seem possible, as a canister cannot hold any secrets.

The buyer gets 50,000,000 Locked ICP for 40,000,000 in two years. Likely a bet of some kind. Contrived, but this kind of thing happens in the options market every day.

As far as a more realistic example, divide all the numbers by 1,000,000, replace the VC with a Retail investor that has terminal cancer that they know will kill them in 3 years but they stake for 8 to get a higher reward.  The numbers are smaller and they don't seem as significant.  But the effect is the same.  Taking undue rewards from the rest of the network.

> Taking undue rewards from the rest of the network.

I mean, an example that could actually put the network at risk. 

I think there are many cases of 'taking undue rewards...' since the problem of assigning fair rewards is intractable. This remains true unless you define fair rewards as whatever the current code dictates, but that defeats the purpose.

All the cases I can think of seem to be resolved by the market, giving the neurons/VP to whoever values them the most.

Also, it might be worth noting that we're protected only up to 8-years (could be less). For instance, some set of 8-year neurons could pass a pretty bad proposal (I don't want to give specific ideas) that gets activated in 8+1 years (then dissolve and sell before the issue). The locked time is a relative buffer, that's why I find it hard to come with a conclusive conclusion. 

And on the other side of the spectrum, you have people like Michael Saylor that probably don't need to lock his Bitcoin to try his best. Maybe Bitcoin at this point has some sort of implicit locking in the supply.

[/quote]

This doesn't seem like rocket science, but maybe it is. It seems plainly obvious to me that those making decisions will make shorter-term decisions of value maximization if they have an out than if they don't.  That leads to daily shorter-term decision-making that, over time, has a cumulative effect of a crappier network than we could have had otherwise.  I don't want a crappy network. I want the most optimal network. It isn't an issue of network attack. It is an issue of how do we set ourselves up to make the most optimal decisions.

DFINITY has a number of PHDs that could likely speak to this far better than I could...but here is the ChatGPT try:

**Objective:** To prove that voter lock-in for a time \(t\) leads to decisions that maximize the long-term value of voters' ownership share in the network compared to scenarios where voters have an exit option at \(t-n\).

#### Definitions and Assumptions

- Let **V** be the set of all voters in the network.
- Each voter **v ∈ V** makes a decision d<sub>v</sub> on proposals that affect the network's value.
- The network's value, and consequently the value of ownership shares, at time ***t*** is denoted by ***N(t)***.
- Voters are rational and aim to maximize their ownership share value over time.
- Proposals have long-term effects, not fully realized until after a period ***t***.

#### Proof

**Part 1: Voter Lock-in and Long-term Maximization**

1. Assume voters are locked in for a period ***t***. Each voter evaluates proposals based on their expected impact on ***N(t)***, the future network value.
2. Given rationality and access to information, voters predict the outcome of proposals on ***N(t)*** and choose **d<sub>v</sub>** to maximize their expected utility, which is directly tied to ***N(t)***.
3. Formally, for each voter ***v***, they choose ***d<sub>v</sub>*** to maximize ***E[ U<sub>v</sub>(N(t))]***, where ***U<sub>v</sub>*** is the utility function of voter ***v***, reflecting their ownership share value.
4. The collective decision-making process aligns individual incentives with the network's long-term value, as each voter's utility maximization inherently accounts for the prolonged impact of decisions.

**Part 2: Exit Option and Suboptimal Decision-making**

1. Introduce the exit option at ***(t-n)***, allowing voters to reassess and potentially alter their commitments based on short-term considerations.
2. This option introduces a preference shift towards maximizing ***E[ U<sub>v</sub>(N(t-n))]*** instead of ***E[ U<sub>v</sub>(N(t))]***, focusing on a nearer future value.
3. The option to exit alters the strategic landscape, enabling voters to hedge against long-term uncertainties by favoring decisions that optimize short-term outcomes, even if these are suboptimal for ***N(t)***.
4. This behavior can lead to a collective action problem where individual rationality does not converge on the collective rationality required to maximize ***N(t)***, evidencing a divergence from the optimal path.

**Comparative Analysis**

1. By comparing the two scenarios, it's evident that lock-in induces a cooperative game framework where voters' decisions are more likely to converge on a Nash equilibrium that maximizes ***N(t)***.
2. In contrast, the exit option introduces a non-cooperative game dynamic, where the Nash equilibrium may align with suboptimal outcomes for ***(N(t)*** due to prioritization of ***N(t-n)***.

#### Conclusion

Given the assumptions and rational behavior of voters, the proof demonstrates that voter lock-in encourages decision-making that aligns with the maximization of the network's long-term value. In contrast, providing an exit option introduces a temporal preference shift that can lead to decisions suboptimal for long-term value maximization.

I'm not sure it's so trivial, Austin. It could be the case that the transfers increase optimality (e.g. by moving neurons to better hands). Also, there is a cost associated with exiting that needs to be taken into account, and the seller is motivated to vote in such a way that they secure a good deal.

Following that reasoning, increasing the maximum dissolve delay to 16 (or better 42) could also make the network more optimal.

The disbursement key for II-controlled neurons would allow to disburse ICP once the neuron is dissolved. This key, once set, cannot be changed. Knowing the key is irreversible, creates a risk for buyers: the previous owner could potentially access the neuron's ICP in the future.

Over 8 years, anything can happen, including the loss of information about the disbursement key. As I understand it, in this case, it's equivalent to losing access and the ability to retrieve invested funds, right? Then, we return to the situation of losing wallet keys (as we know, a large amount of Bitcoin was irretrievably lost this way), and this problem was addressed by Internet Identity with multiple keys and their administration. Now, by adding a 'disbursement key,' we seem to be going back to this problem. If not, then more technical information is needed to understand.

The idea is to have one additional disbursement key, which the user can choose to set or not. Please note, that the controller of the neuron would have full control over the neuron (as today) , including the ability to disbure it once it is dissolved. Does this clarify your question ?

-------------------------

alexeychirkov | 2024-03-21 10:19:20 UTC | #77

Did I get it right - In the case of the II-controlled neuron - the user also *is* the controller (user = principal with origin “https://nns.ic0.app").
Therefore, after setting the disbursement key and losing it, the user will NOT be able to disburse the neuron, even while remaining the controller?

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-03-21 10:19:57 UTC | #78

When an Internet Identity's neuron is bound to a disbursement key, there is an inherent risk for the sole owner to lose their private key in the future. This goes against the main objective of developing ICP, which aims to enhance user experience by eliminating the need to memorize or store private keys. Are there any alternative solutions that are more user-friendly?

I think this is a barrier that should be removed, without limitation, for a few reasons, but I’m only going to touch on the most prominent for the sake of time;

1. Preventing Neurons from self authenticating does not prevent the trading of neurons. People can trade internet identities, both online or in person - which is a workaround that caused users to lose their entire attached identity rather than solely the neuron. 

2. From the perspective of a project, being $STACK, this is a function that we’ve been aiming to leverage, yet have to use an expensive “workaround” to utilize. $STACK aims to incentivize governance participation within ICP, and canister controlled named neurons directly enable ease of management for the DAO rather than convoluted tECDSA & HTTPS solutions. I don’t see why this group should be penalized both in rewards or voting power, when the goal is incentivizing participation in the NNS to begin with. I’d have to imagine there are other entities with similiar goals (which may not be governance focused, but more financially aligned, such as Openchats Neuron) who intend to leverage this in a positive manner as well. 

My concluding statement is more so of a question; after we have pushed for this function for the last 3 years, explaining the lack of security risk associated due to excessive fiat requirements, concentration of VP, etc - yet consistently being told that this can’t be enacted by DFINITY **due to a security risk** - what has changed?

No, the idea of the disbursement key is to give whoever knows the disbursement key the right to disburse for a particular neuron. The controller of the neuron can still do all neuron operations (including disburse) without needing the disbursement key.

I think this is being looked at now again because a neuron marketplace and canister controlled neurons already happened, even with the current design of the system.

It's kind of an example of [Murphys law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law). Maybe we should be considering that with this new proposed design that people will probably in the future figure out more workarounds to avoid the new restrictions - especially if there is an incentive.

You cannot sell a neuron, whether online or in person, if it is owned by a LEDGER. The previous owner can at any time obtain a new LEDGER, input the seed phrase, and regain control. As a result, the buyer cannot achieve 100% ownership of the purchased neuron, since the seed phrase cannot be changed without losing ownership of the neuron. A similar approach is intended for neurons created through Internet Identity.

It seems the main reason for this new design and proposal is to enable canisters to control neurons 

But we want these restrictions for obvious reasons:

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:28597"]
* neurons should have an incentive to vote in the long-term interest of the Internet Computer and
* to avoid the possibility of attacks where an attacker acquires tokens only for a short amount of time, votes on a malicious proposal (e.g. transfer tokens) and then sells the neurons again. Similar types of attacks have been executed on DAOs in the past ([example ](https://medium.com/immunefi/hack-analysis-beanstalk-governance-attack-april-2022-f42788fc821e)).
[/quote]

Both of these points tie into each other really - we don't want bad actors voting / creating nefarious proposals and getting them approved by the NNS.

Leading on from what I was saying earlier about people figuring out workarounds. Take this Idea:

- A canister that controls a neuron.
- An organisation / dApp controls this canister.
- This is a successful organisation / dApp and there is a lot of ICP in this neuron and it's increasing.
- The organisation / dApp has no interest in voting it just wants the rewards for doing so.
- **It decides to auction off it's voting power for a small fee.**
- The buyer of the voting power get's some of the rewards for voting (rewards > fee).

Now we have a system in which a bad actor can obtain large amounts voting power for an even lower price than buying neurons directly and not really have to worry about dumping or selling a neurons at all.

And to answer your question on what has changed: We thought further about this topic, in particular how to balance the wish from many developers to enable canister-controlled neurons (enabling many interesting uses cases) vs how to still prevent deep neuron markets (which could be used for a voting attack). The preliminary conclusion, outlined above, was essentially to allow canister-controlled neurons (which are transferable), balanced by incentives giving higher rewards to neurons which are not transferable (so that not too many neuron become transferable).

I just thought about it there so the incentives I came up with are off.

but I was just raising the point that we could essentially see voting power marketplaces via canister controlled neurons (alongside even neuron marketplaces).

The incentives could be anything, I'm sure people / the marketplace would figure something optimal out. 

This touches on the main point of all this discussion which is not wanting a bad actor to control too much voting power, creating and approving nefarious proposals and leaving the eco-system. So, what I'm saying is with the current DAO system and the right dApps and tools I don't think we can avoid this 100%.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-03-21 11:20:31 UTC | #95

Thanks for replying. I can’t find the exact cost analysis I did, but we’d deduced it’d cost hundreds of millions to acquire 10% of ICP in the bear market - I cant imagine what that’s turned into now that we’re up 400%+. I guess I’m just not really seeing where the pivot comes from on your side, as nothing has really changed, hence my curiosity on why the “security risk” in no longer a concern. 

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:5, topic:24568"]
Neuron Markets exchange in $ICP as of present (I understand this may not always be the case, but this is where we’re at now).

Meaning in order for somebody to acquire a neuron, they still have to buy $ICP. Beyond this, it takes hundreds of millions, without accounting for liquidity slippage, to acquire even 10% of $ICP, let alone enough to pull off a malicious attack against DFINITYs 99.99% on code based topics, or ~25% in governance topics (which aren’t binding, you have to submit a code based prop after the fact anyways). And then offload your hundreds of millions dollar position after you’ve attempted x malicious action.

I’d agree you can no longer force people into the ponzi (this is a good thing, right guys??? right???) when they have the opportunity to buy/sell neuron’s as they please - but they already can.

What stops me from selling my internet identity OTC? What makes it different?

This seems like a risk that would have to be weighed by members of the DAO. If they are willing to accept that risk then they will be accountable for their decision. Just as they will be held accountable if they chose to fund a DAO that isn't really a DAO.

Overall, I'm just happy that this proposal gives us a choice. I'm also okay with the penalty because rewards are a reflection of your commitment to the network. Reducing the rewards of an 8 year neuron that can be easily transferred seems logical to me.

Why not force ALL neurons to have a disbursement key? That might solve the issue of a) a neuron marketplace and b) over complicating things.

Honestly a 20% penalty on rewards feels pretty weak in the grand scheme of keeping optionality. A 6 month neuron earns 50% lower rewards currently than a 8 year neuron, but now I can get higher rewards for a 8 year neuron without a PoK (that I can sell) than a 6 month neuron with PoK? Something feels wrong here

-------------------------

Also it would be great to explain again in simple terms how PoK solves the neuron marketplace issue. It seems to only be useful for people who want self custody.
