Allowing the sale of long-term neurons can actually enhance our ecosystem’s dynamism and resilience. When stakeholders can sell their neurons, we’re not just enabling a financial transaction; we’re potentially trading passive holding for active participation. This is because the sale opens up the opportunity for these neurons to be acquired by individuals who are not just financially invested but are also willing to actively contribute to the ecosystem’s governance and future direction.
[/quote]


If this were the goal, then why not accomplish it by removing dissolve delay as a neuron parameter?  There is no need for neuron transfer if there is no dissolve delay.  

I’m not claiming I agree with this goal, but I’m interested in why people want to enable a neuron marketplace instead of removing the root cause of why people feel there is a need for a neuron marketplace.

Hi @skilesare. I wanted to mention something here in slightly longer form that I also mentioned to you on Twitter.

I like your thought exercise but I feel that it is vague in one key area. You mentioned that this theoretical VC neuron has arranged a contract where a buyer has purchased the rights to control a 50M ICP neuron 2 years in the future. This is essentially a form of an option/futures contract. There are standard ways of pricing such contracts. Under simplifying assumptions, one can use the [time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money) with a flat discount rate in order to calculate the present value of a future asset. The [Black-Scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model#Black%E2%80%93Scholes_formula) can accommodate more complicated assumptions. 

My point here is that there is that there should be a way to get an exact price that a market participant will be willing to pay for the contract you are describing. If neuron transfers could be tracked, then you could penalize the voting power of a transferred neuron. This penalty should be exactly proportional to the amount of ICP that this VC "stole" from the network by selling early. Since both the buyer and the seller are aware of this restriction, it will be reflected in the purchase price of the contract, thereby negating the potential profit by the VC.

I may be missing important security/engineering details here but I find this idea very exciting. It seems to align the voting incentives with the economic ones.

-------------------------

crabtr26 | 2024-03-27 21:49:55 UTC | #207

I think that this also addresses your point @wpb. There are definitely unique market dynamics that are made possible by introducing the delay. You could, in principal, retain the financial incentive for long-term investors while simultaneously making neurons more liquid by introducing an offsetting transfer penalty. This is not possible with no delay.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-03-27 22:03:12 UTC | #208

Yeah...I think so...provided people don't route around that mechanism.  Generally, you have to post collateral when you have some outstanding commitment like that.  To extend that idea to neurons, every neuron would need to be non-splitable and not matureable until completely dissolved.  In that case we could likely calculate what your payment should have been vs. what it was and deduct the difference.

But realistically, people like harvesting from their neurons....but once it is gone, it is gone.(I guess you could track the maturity vs principal and cap it if the amount left in the neuron ever gets close to a theoretical max penalty.)

If everything had PoK for regular neurons and Controller tracking for canister neurons, and we could implement this system it could be pretty interesting.  It will much better when the rates are lower because it would take you many years to get to your locked principal total in rewards.  At that point you could re post the collateral to keep your bonuses.

With that system you'd be able to sell/transfer at any time, but some of your locked principal would be forfeited.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-03-28 00:21:02 UTC | #209

I do not understand this at all. Why would you impose a 20% discount on neurons without PoK and not a 100% discount? 

Transferable neurons that are not PoK have no place in our governance system. 

Why would we imperil our governance system I don’t get it. Why do we want a liquid market around neurons without PoK?

If people want to just buy liquid tokens they can do that. If people want to take part in governance, well then they have to lock up their tokens. I’m sorry that should be the way it is. Otherwise don’t stake.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-03-28 01:20:08 UTC | #210

I am not entirely sure whether this analogy is completely accurate. To me, NNS governance is similar to shares in traditional markets. 

If a long-term investor initially commits to investing for the long haul but then decides to sell their shares midway due to some reason, does that constitute a breach of agreement? 

In my opinion, the IDgeek marketplace could serve as a facilitator for the ICP ecosystem to find a harmonious point through its market discovery system. IDgeek market helps neurons find a matching profile of an investor. 

Regarding whether all neurons will be locked for eight years because they have the same liquidity as short-term neurons, I believe that once people realize that eight-year neurons are more valuable than shorter-term ones, there will be price discovery, and eight-year neurons will be sold at a premium price.

-------------------------

crabtr26 | 2024-03-28 05:04:47 UTC | #211

Hmm. I am not sure I see a need for collateral here. I basically think of the future rewards as the collateral. In my mind, there should be no outstanding commitment to the network by a neuron's former owner once the neuron has been transferred.

From a pure trading perspective, I would think that if you stake *X* ICP for 8 years, and then sell ownership of your neuron at year *Y* (*Y* < 8), the total ICP accumulated after the transfer should be equivalent to the amount of ICP you would have received by staking *X* ICP for *N* years and then letting it dissolve for the remaining *M* years, so that *N+M=Y* and *N* is maximized. I wonder if there is a way to work backwards from there.

Pricing it this way is clearly not fair to the network because by staking in an 8 year neuron instead of in an *N* year neuron and never dissolving it, you have obtained additional voting power during those *Y* years at no additional cost. The amount of extra voting power obtained is essentially equal to:

Extra Voting Power = `(8_years_dissolve_delay_bonus - N_years_dissolve_delay_bonus) * (1 + Y_years_age_bonus - N_years_age_bonus) * X * Y`,

ignoring the accumulation of age bonuses. There was also additional maturity earned during those *Y* years. I am not sure what the exact formula for that is, but I think it can be calculated similarly. Maybe `(Extra Voting Power Obtained) + (Extra Maturity Earned)` is a basic starting point for a transfer penalty?

It does become more complicated once you consider compounding of the earned maturity. I think you could still have the payouts though. You would just need enough staked ICP + staked maturity remaining in your neuron to cover the cost of a transfer if you wanted to do that.

Just to circle this back to @bjoernek's OP:

Phase 1: I support lifting the restrictions on canister controlled neurons as a starting point. I think it presents an interesting new space of possibilities to explore, and from what I am reading here it seems like this does not pose any immediate or likely future threat to the health of the network.

Phase 2 & 3: I think that some form of reduced reward/voting power mechanism for transferable/transfered neurons is interesting. I am not sure I am settled on what exactly is the correct trajectory here. I like the idea of a temporary loss of voting power in the case of a transfer as mentioned by @Seers but I am not sure how to avoid the circumvention of this through a hierarchy of canisters, etc.

> If this were the goal, then why not accomplish it by removing dissolve delay as a neuron parameter? There is no need for neuron transfer if there is no dissolve delay.


Because you are taking out from governance your stake and by doing so increase inflation pressure. In the case of sale - locked ICPs are staying locked.

hpeebles | 2024-03-28 08:09:01 UTC | #216

Having thought about this a bit more I think we should simply allow canisters to control neurons and make no other changes.

SNS neurons can already have their controllers changed entirely so they can all be exchanged even if controlled by an II principal.

If canister controlled neurons get a 20% reduction in voting power, all that means is that it will cost 25% more to buy the same amount of voting power on a neuron marketplace, so it doesn't prevent malicious actors buying voting power using flash loans.

Also, more than 1/4 of all ICP is locked for 8 years. That is a huge amount of voting power that won't be able to be transferred. So even if neuron marketplaces do pop up, their total voting power will be relatively tiny (for at least the next few years).

I really think we shouldn't add more complexity to neurons. My brother has some neurons, he signed in the the NNS app and then called me because he wanted to know about maturity (staked and available), age bonus, disbursing, spawning, etc. Neurons are already more than complicated enough. Adding PoK is adding significantly more complexity.

Some people have said that if you can trade your neuron then you will be incentivised to make short term rather than long term decisions. But even if you consider that to be true, this is such a small group of people that it doesn't validate adding more complexity to prevent it happening.

The current solution proposed by Dfinity is canister controlled neurons receive 20% less voting power and it would still allow for a liquid market around neurons without PoK? I think the Idea behind the 20% less voting power is to deter a nefarious actor buying neurons for a governance attack (I don't know if it would be effective - I don't think anyone knows).

I was not suggesting anything new and I was trying to think of a simple implmentation without adding the new complexity of PoK (currently PoK does not exist on neurons). Are you saying you don't want canister controlled neurons at all then?

 For the record I don't really want to see a neuron marketplace appear. I'm not sure what the long term effects of something like that would be. But I agree with others in this thread I would like to see canister controlled neurons but I think PoK is just too complex.

Then we should form a joint stock company. Bluntly, the NNS is absolutely NOT like governance shares in traditional markets. We could do that, but then it is almost certainly a security and not a utility token. 

Joint stock companies have shares that trade freely and an incentive system for electing board members who steer the company. Board and shareholders have incentives to increase shareholder value exclusively. It is a completely different model. I don't think you can build a world computer under the governance of this kind because it is too easy to make money in too many other ways.

I'm probably the biggest proponent of this. I think this is the biggest threat to the network. Lots of small decisions that end up degrading the network long-term. I'd argue that while it is a small group of people now, it could become a very large group very quickly.  We don't have to look around the world very much to see how quickly sentiment, groups, organizations, and public opinion can change very quickly.  After all, we are all rooting for 100x more people to be on our network as soon as humanly possible right? We don't have much control over who those folks are, what their intentions are, whether or not they are VCs trying to subvert the network because the funded the competition or what.

We don't have many 'small matters' where a few votes here and there change the direction of the network, but in a healthy, vibrant, and engaged network at the level we are reaching for we should be having those ALL THE TIME.

All of that being said, we likely have some time and this could be studied more so I'm not opposed to moving forward with canister neurons while we do that...its been too long that we've suppressed many of the unique funding opportunities that they provide.

I don't want to throw too many gates up, but I'd really like this to start with whitelisting of canisters that can control neurons.  This doesn't seem like a huge change and it would help us closely monitor the types of applications that are being built with this power.  If the registration is also tied to the controllers of the canister it could help limit the transfer ability.

Maybe this would just drive people to the tecdsa route, but if it was cheap, easy and straight forward it would likely lead to some cultural best practices:

- Our code is here: xxxx
- Our controllers are here: xxxx
- We plan to use the neurons to do: xxxx
- Neurons will/won't be tradeable under the following conditions: xxxx

I don't like putting more on the NNS...perhaps this should be a separate SNS that votes on these things?  Although there isn't much economic security here so that might be gameable.

If we get away down the line and there just isn't much controversy opening it up permissionless could eventually make sense.

Just thinking out loud here.

Idea #42: making slashing work

* If we discover that a harmful proposal has been approved, we could slash the neurons that voted for adoption.
* The decision to slash might be made offchain, or by a selected group of neurons, or disabling following, or disabling VP of canisters, or by changing the VP of certain neurons.
* [Optionally] We could utilize the transfer delay we discussed previously. However, this time, users would mark it themselves as a way to "clear" the neuron's history, avoiding getting slashed for proposals not voted on by themselves.

I think this is a pretty nice solution: flexible, simple and more secure.

Perhaps there is a misunderstanding on my end. 

My suggestion was that all neurons (including canister controlled neurons) get PoK.

If all neurons, including canister controlled neurons, got PoK then we can make the discount for non PoK neurons 100%.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2024-03-29 23:59:08 UTC | #226

Furthermore, what if we beefed up the idea of the “disbursement key”. As it’s currently proposed, my understanding is that the disbursement key is just known and cannot be unknown, but it is not required to perform any functions. 

What if instead of a “disbursement key”, we had a “transfer key”. And the transfer key was required to transfer the neuron controller. So it essentially becomes the new PEM file for each neuron as it relates to neuron transfers only. 

Is that possible? If so, it is highly unlikely neuron markets would form under that construct.

If someone design a system that encapsulate this new PoK *known* design into something that just display the previous design, then we can proove that the PoK remains unknown and the market can still fleurish.

How ?
1. Encapsulate everything in canisters that use PoK but also not give the PoK visibility to the user
2. Add non PoK neuron ( actual state of neurons ) into this system before PoK is known ( either before the ICP is stacked or before the PoK is implemented for existing neurons ).
3. those Canister will then have the optimised voting rewards and act as it was before

2 Choice : 
- Keep **wasting ressources** to prevent neurons trades ( 2 easy things to understand : what can be done offline can be done online, neuron trade dont affect security of the network, this add more useless complexity to the neurons system making average user run away )
- Use those ressources to improve the things lastjms mentionned on twitter and here https://forum.dfinity.org/t/lets-solve-these-crucial-protocol-weaknesses/28329

Maybe revoking the PoK? or whatever we decide to use to make them non-transferable. I don’t know if that’s possible or if there is another primitive. I’m imagining something like:

* Everyone has a PoK.
* When you wish to make a transfer, you initiate a countdown to revoke the PoK.
* During this countdown, you are not allowed to vote.
* Once the PoK is revoked, the transfer is executed.
* If the recipient is an individual, they will generate a new PoK and continue voting.
* If the recipient is a marketplace, it will not generate a new PoK in order to remain liquid and will not have the ability to vote.

ok I see. So you are thinking about combining the PoK set-up and the transfer penalty (Previously, I understood that you suggested to apply a transfer penalty while avoiding the technical complexities of implementing a PoK).

Enabling a disbursement key (or transfer key) for all neurons (being stored in an encrypted fashion on-chain) would mean that the security of the whole NNS would depend on the applied encryption scheme (which seems like adding an additional attack vector).

The suggestion proposed a phased roll-out strategy, where each phase is interlinked. Initially, it involves lifting current restrictions on neuron control, followed by introducing incentives for holding non-transferable neurons in a subsequent phase. Hence, I see these phases as part of a bigger picture and not as individual standalone measures.

However, to address your points on proposal segmentation and resource usage, it would seem natural to link the timing and priority of implementing the complex later phase to the observed developments within potential neuron markets.

Thanks Bjorn. What are your thoughts as it relates to providing PoK and transferrability to existing neurons that are hardware controlled? 

Neuron holders that set up their neurons using hardware wallets in the past may want to transfer their neurons to a canister as they are the future of wallets. Of course, one would not want to create any security issues. I am just wondering how to bridge the gap. Seems a bit unfair that only new neurons have the option of being canister controlled and implementing PoK.

dx111 | 2024-04-03 11:47:11 UTC | #233

I suggest reducing the restrictions on the transfer of neurons. stETH can be traded normally without any security issues, and DFINITY and ICA have a significant amount of voting power. Recently, I looked into the Ethena project, which uses stETH to create stablecoins. It's an amazing project that generates value from a large amount of dormant ETH. I hope ICP can do the same.

Apologies for the delayed response. The requirement which you raise, i.e., the ability to transfer neurons from one technology solution to another, seems very fair. In the moment, you can transfer from say Quill to Ledger or vice versa (using the Seed phrase), but for example Ledger to II (and potentially in the future from Ledger to a canister solution) is currently not possible. Addressing this would likely require a dedicated project. 

Using the technical components discussed in this thread, I currently do not see how to enable such transferability for the security concerns mentioned above.

Thank you for your patience, and I apologize for the delayed response.

Regarding the slashing solution, a significant challenge would be determining which neurons to slash. If a group of attackers gains enough voting power to pass malicious proposals, they could similarly use their power to reject any slashing attempts. Additionally, defining what constitutes a "malicious proposal" is not straightforward, adding complexity to the decision-making process.

No worries. 👍

Regarding the neurons that should be slashed, it would be those that voted to adopt the malicious proposal.

>  they could similarly use their power to reject any slashing attempts

If we are discussing this topic along with lifting neuron restrictions in canisters, we can assume that the voting power (VP) is attached to canisters. Therefore, simply disabling or reducing the VP of these neurons should suffice to adopt the slashing proposal.

> defining what constitutes a “malicious proposal” is not straightforward, adding complexity to the decision-making process.

I think there is no better way. For example, in the original proposal we are directly assuming that canisters are malicious and applying a penalty beforehand.

If it involves a transfer (as in the example given) or if it affects the functioning of a subnet, it seems to be straightforward. It works with the worst proposals and there is no need to define it beforehand. Additionally, the penalty could vary depending on the severity of the damage.

Hi all,

following up on the request for additional information regarding the Schnorr Proof of Knowledge, please find the details below.

###  Schnorr Proof of Knowledge

The Schnorr Proof of Knowledge (PoK) is a cryptographic protocol used to demonstrate that a prover knows a secret value without revealing the value itself. This technique is part of a family of proofs known as zero-knowledge proofs. The basic idea is proving knowledge of a secret associated with a discrete logarithm problem. Specifically, the Schnorr PoK allows a prover to show that they know the discrete logarithm of a public value \(g^x\) with respect to a base \(g\) in a given group, without revealing \(x\) itself.

Here is an overview of key steps involved:

- **Setup**: Let \(G\) be a cyclic group of order \(p\) and generator \(g\). The prover has a secret \(x\), and the public key is \(y = g^x ).

- **Commitment**: The prover selects a random natural number \(r\) and sends \(t = g^r \) to the verifier.

- **Challenge**: The verifier sends a random challenge \(c\) to the prover.

- **Response**: The prover calculates \(s = r + cx \mod p\) and sends it back.

- **Verification**: The verifier checks if \(g^s = t   y^c ). If true, it confirms the prover's knowledge of \(x\) without revealing \(x\) itself. (Note that  g^s = g^{r+cx} = g^r  g^{cx} = t  y^c ).

### Relevance of Schnorr PoK for this thread

Threshold cryptography, utilized in signature schemes like ECDSA or BLS, allows signing capabilities to be distributed across multiple parties. For instance, both threshold ECDSA (tECDSA) and threshold BLS (tBLS) signatures are supported natively by the ICP protocol. There is also a non-interactive threshold Schnorr signature scheme, which is planned to be added to the ICP protocol.

An interactive Schnorr PoK is not compatible with these threshold signature schemes due to its design: In the threshold signature schemes, the cryptographic challenges are deterministically computed using a hash function, which incorporates the message. On the other hand, in the interactive Schnoor PoK the cryptographic challenge is chosen randomly by the verifier. Consequently, canisters, which rely on tECDSA for signing messages, cannot provide an interactive Schnorr PoK. Similarly, II-controlled neurons that use tBLS are also unable to provide an interactive PoK.

In contrast, a user who manages their neurons via Quill or a Ledger device can provide a Schnorr PoK of their secret neuron controller key.

### Schnorr PoK vs Disbursement Key

II-controlled neurons cannot directly participate in a Schnorr PoK scheme due to their reliance on tBLS signatures. To allow these neurons access to enhanced rewards while disincentivizing neuron transfers, one might create a new scheme providing the neuron controller access to a non-modifiable disbursement key.

This key, controlling the disbursement of ICP and possibly neuron maturity, would grant significant power to its holder. Since knowledge of the key is irreversible, this poses a risk to buyers; previous owners might retain access to the neuron’s ICP or voting rewards.

Conceptually, providing a PoK of the newly created disbursement key is similar to providing a PoK of the controller key. In both cases, possession of the key verifies knowledge of a specific secret. However, the disbursement key introduces a new key (which requires a whole new scheme to manage this additional key) vs a PoK of the existing controller key does not.

Hi all, 

Here is my preliminary (personal) attempt to summarize the discussion in this thread on neuron control restrictions: 

Everybody seems to be in favor of lifting restrictions to allow canisters to control neurons (phase 1).

However, opinions differ regarding the need for additional measures to disincentivize neuron transfers. Implementing further restrictions, such as those suggested in phases 2 and 3, would enhance security but also comes at a cost (through high implementation effort and added complexity for users). This applies in particular to phase 3. 

Several interesting ideas for additional/alternatives measures were also proposed, such as whitelisting certain canister-controlled neurons (e.g., those managed by a truly decentralized SNS), further ideas to  facilitate neuron management, or slashing the stake of canister-controlled neurons in case of malicious behavior. 

A key point discussed is the issue of materiality: As long as a small number of neurons are controlled by canisters or II, this does significantly impact long-term voting behavior of the NNS overall. Therefore, we might proceed with phase 1 (removing restrictions) while delaying further phases or alternative measures, depending on how the materiality of canister-controlled neurons evolves. In this context, we might need to improve NNS metrics, such as reporting the stake and voting power of canister-controlled neurons. It is important to note that additional measures could be reconsidered if this situation changes.

Does this summary reflect our discussion accurately?

@bjoernek, I want to state for the record that I’m **opposed** to limiting canister-controlled neuron functionality to just a Whitelisted group of neurons. Doing this would adversely effect the [Personal DAO](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/personal-dao-a-commoditized-dao-that-functions-as-a-icp-neuron-pool-for-now-more-features-on-the-way/29958) governance model which relies on each Personal DAO replica having the ability to stake its own canister-controlled neurons in order for DAO members to receive voting power.

 I’m also opposed to introducing the idea of some sort of slashing mechanism as doing so would automatically classify any neuron application service on the IC as a security as referenced in Wisconsin’s Department of Financial Institution’s (DFI) Administrative Enforcement Action Against Coinbase which can be found [here](https://dfi.wi.gov/Documents/Securities/RegistrationOfProfessionals/EnforcementAdministrativeOrders/2023/20230606CoinbaseCoinbaseGlobal.pdf) on page 5, section 24. In this Administrative Enforcement Action, The DFI sites the possibility of slashing as being a potential negative consequence of a mismanagement by the Coinbase, and uses that as a justification for why staking services that feature the risk of slashing should be classified as a security.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-04-23 20:47:59 UTC | #245

Thanks, Wisconsin. :roll_eyes:

Jesse...would there be some reason those neurons couldn't register with the whitelist system? The goal here would be the ability to monitor and ensure that these neurons weren't masquerading as a market in disguise.  I'd imagine generally the canister won't be changing the controller very often which is what we'd want to monitor.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2024-04-23 21:10:45 UTC | #246

If the whitelist system has a way for neurons to register programmatically and permissionlessly from within a canister, then it wouldn't be an issue. 

otherwise, if each Personal DAO (or worse, each Neuron of each Personal DAO) has to be recognized by the registry system after some sort of registration process that requires a persons to interactively undergo said process, it would make it virtually impossible for me to carry out the Personal DAO business model since each DAO would have to have someone to undergo that process before its DAO-controlled neurons can exist.

It seems to be a long list of arguments, not just because of that. It could be de-risked further by slashing only canisters' neurons. Also, the NNS is not Coinbase. I think there are a few L1s with slashing that are not labeled as security (Ethereum, Polkadot?).

I think my point is that there is always a "slashing" version that's lighter than the original proposal. Perhaps *lazy restriction* is a better name.

Some options that can be combined:
- add a third choice, 'abstain,' that is safe from slashing, 
- or to slash only some proposals, 
- or only rewards, 
- or have a 'safe vote' with less VP, similar to what was proposed originally.
 
So, for instance, staking services could always vote in safe mode. However, there are always more choices at the canister/individual level to maximize voting power and achieve the highest degree of safety.

Hi all, 

Thank you for all the additional feedback! It seems we are largely in agreement, as per the summary above. We could decide the specific actions to be taken if the proportion of canister-controlled neurons becomes too high at a later time, using the ideas shared in this thread.

Following up on the materiality aspect, we could define a materiality threshold upfront. For instance, we could suggest to implement mitigation measures for neuron control if the percentage of canister-controlled neurons exceeds 10% or 20%.

I will aim to share a draft of the motion proposal by next week.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-05-07 16:45:13 UTC | #253

Hi all, 

wrapping up the discussion on neuron control restrictions, here is the suggested text for the motion proposal, which I intend to submit next week

------

### TL;DR

The Internet Computer Protocol prevents canisters from directly controlling neurons, a measure intended to block neuron sales and ensure long-term thinking in voting behavior. However, these restrictions can be circumvented by a canister using threshold ECDSA (tECDSA) and HTTP outcalls. This suggests a need to reconsider the restrictions and their effectiveness.

This proposal recommends lifting restrictions on canister neuron control in the NNS and monitoring their materiality through newly developed metrics. A threshold is set to initiate mitigation measures if canister-controlled neurons exceed 10% of total voting power ~~, except for those controlled by DAOs~~. Additional measures to disincentive neuron transfers will be considered and implemented if this threshold is reached, balancing security enhancements with user complexity and implementation effort.

### Background

**Restrictions on Neuron Control**

In the ICP network, neurons are decision-making entities created through the staking of ICP tokens. These neurons participate in governance by voting on proposals. To promote long-term decision-making, users are incentivized to stake their tokens for several years. Additionally, control over neurons is deliberately restricted: Currently only so-called [self-authenticating principals](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Principal#Self-Authenticating_principal) can be set as the controller of a neuron. A self-authenticating principal is an entity that utilizes its own cryptographic key pair (consisting of a private and a public key) to authenticate itself; the idea being that control over the underlying private key cannot be transferred without full trust. For example, a user relying on Internet Identity, Quill or a Ledger hardware wallet is of this kind. Canisters, which do not possess self-authenticating principals, are therefore excluded from directly controlling neurons.

**Reason for the Restrictions on Neuron Control**

The restriction is based on the requirement that neurons should not be sold - when canisters can control neurons directly, one can sell a neuron by selling the canister that controls it. It is considered important for neurons to be non-transferable/no-sellable because

* neurons should have an incentive to vote in the long-term interest of the Internet Computer and
* to avoid the possibility of attacks where an attacker acquires tokens only for a short amount of time, votes on a malicious proposal (e.g. transfer tokens) and then sells the neurons again.

**Circumventing Restrictions on Neuron Control**

Despite these safeguards, there are a few ways to bypass the restrictions on neuron control:

* Threshold ECDSA ([tECDSA](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works/)): As canisters are able to control tECDSA keys, which are a feature of the Internet Computer Protocol, they can also sign ingress messages to the Internet Computer and thereby act as the controller of a neuron (making calls via HTTP to appear as ingress).
* Canister signatures: A canister can control a neuron through canister signatures, again making calls via HTTP to appear as ingress.

Furthermore, it is also possible to control a neuron via an Internet Identity (II) and [sell the II](https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.icp0.io/).

### Revisiting Neuron Control Restrictions

Given that the restriction for canisters to not control neurons can be circumvented relatively easily, it should be considered to drop that restriction. This was suggested by several ICP community members already. Lifting that restriction would bring the following benefits

* Facilitate NNS neurons that are SNS controlled: SNSs already chose to do this (e.g. OpenChat, GoldDAO), providing them a continuous income to cover cycles fees and involving SNSs in NNS governance. Allowing direct canister control of neurons would simplify the current more complicated workflow via tECDSA.
* Consistency with SNS: As opposed to the NNS, the SNS framework does not apply restrictions on neuron controllers.
* Facilitate organizational neuron ownership: An organization could control a neuron via a canister.

A key point discussed in the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597) is the issue of materiality: As long as only a small number of neurons are controlled by canisters or through II, this does not significantly impact long-term voting behavior of the NNS overall.

### Suggested Way Forward

Acknowledging the potential for circumvention of the current mechanism, it is recommended to lift the restrictions on canister neuron control while monitoring the materiality of canister-controlled neurons, via the following steps:

* Lift restrictions on neuron control: Remove existing restrictions, allowing canisters to control NNS neurons.
* Implement new metrics: Develop and implement metrics in the NNS governance canister that track the total stake and voting power of canister-controlled neurons on a daily basis. This should include the proportion of canister-controlled voting power relative to the total voting power.
* Establish a materiality threshold: Set a threshold that triggers mitigation measures if canister-controlled neurons exceed 10% of the total voting power. ~~Neurons controlled by DAOs are exempt from this threshold.~~ The threshold might be adjusted at a later point in time. *For example, the threshold might be increased (upon NNS approval) following a materiality analysis of canister-controlled neurons belonging to DAOs, which are not considered to be an issue.* 
* Delayed implementation of additional measures: Additional disincentives for neuron transfers will be implemented if the materiality threshold is surpassed. While further measures could enhance security, they would also increase complexity for users and require significant implementation effort. The specifics of these mitigation measures can be determined as the situation evolves and will be subject to a separate motion proposal. For instance, these disincentives would reduce the rewards for transferable neurons created after this proposal is passed; to avoid the reduction, non-transferability of neurons could be shown via a proof of knowledge of a cryptographic key controlling the neuron.

Hi @bjoernek thank you for the update. I think it’s great that DF is moving forward with this proposal. 

I do have a couple questions about this part:

1. When you write it in the proposal this way it sounds like, by adopting this proposal, we are agreeing to go ahead and implement *some* mitigation measure when the threshold is exceeded. Was that the intent? If so, it seems like we’re writing a blank check to implement whatever mitigations you choose.

2. What qualifies as a DAO in this context? Is is strictly NNS approved SNS’? Seems like something that needs clarification.

Thank you!

The intention of this sentence is: Mitigation will be triggered, but the precise kind of mitigation measure will be defined later on. I think we can build on the ideas in this thread, but this will require a separate syndication and also a motion proposal. Let me add a sentence to make this point more clear. In the next bullet I have enhanced the sentence "The specifics of these mitigation measures can be determined as the situation evolves" by  "and will be subject to a separate motion proposal."

Good question. These could be SNS DAOs but also other DAOs on ICP.  Important is that these DAOs are truly decentralized and not controlled by a single entity.

I'm going to be "that guy" for a second and ask what DF considers to be "truly decentralized". I think that is very subjective. Would it be better to say that a canister can request an exemption that is subject to NNS approval? This way, we just leave it up to stakeholders to use their best judgement.

Edit: Thinking about this a bit more; I do like the idea of having this exemption be something that can be granted **and revoked** by the NNS on a case by case basis. We really don't know how the IC is going to evolve and specifying a DAO seems way too restrictive.

**Short answer:** Yes, if you're referring only to the final implementation as the action.

**Long answer:** The term "actions" can be interpreted broadly. In this context, it includes restarting discussions on this topic in the forum and developing concrete implementation proposals. However, actual implementation and the release of any mitigation measures, such as reducing rewards for transferable neurons, would require governance approval. Important is to note, that we already formulate the intent that something should be done once canister-controlled neurons become material. 

Does this clarify things for you?

I agree that defining the exact scope of DAOs eligible for exemption is not clear-cut. However, implementing a formal NNS approval process at this stage, when we are primarily monitoring materiality without knowing how close we will get to the threshold, may be unnecessarily heavy as process.

Initially, I suggest a simpler approach: automatically include all SNS DAOs (except Dragginzs) and consider other DAOs upon request, without requiring NNS approval. This setup allows us to start broadly and refine our criteria as we approach the threshold. Would that make sense to you?

That's fair. Here's what I understand based on your explanation.

- If the materiality threshold is exceeded before any mitigation measures are implemented the NNS will continue issuing maturity rewards to all voting neurons as described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/staking-voting-rewards). 
- If the materiality threshold is exceeded and mitigation measures have already been implemented then those mitigation measures will have immediate effect.
- Mitigation measures will not be implemented without first being proposed, in a proposal with the topic "Governance", and adopted by NNS stakeholders

Please let me know if that isn't correct.

I think there is a substantial implicit demand of action implicit to this.  Think 'We're going to go with ecdsa signing until it becomes evident that quantum computers are near to cracking it.'  If you don't act in that situation you're ceding the security of the network to eventual oblivion.  Maybe that isn't quite the case here, but I'd say given enough time you absolutely will encounter a situation where someone attempts to manipulate governance via a canister-controlled scheme.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2024-05-03 19:06:30 UTC | #263

Copy. I agree this is implicit. I was more so concerned about the expected behavior of the NNS as a system in the event we exceed the threshold before any mitigation measures are implemented.

@LightningLad91 
You make a fair point that within the suggested monitoring the exclusion of canister-controlled neurons belonging to DAOs is not sufficiently clear. Thank you for pointing this out. 

To resolve this while maintaining simplicity in monitoring, I suggest to temporarily remove the exclusion of DAOs. Instead, I will emphasize that this aspect could be revisited in future monitoring enhancements. For instance, the materiality threshold could be adjusted (pending NNS approval) following a materiality analysis of canister-controlled neurons belonging to DAOs.

I will edit the draft motion accordingly.

Hi @GSWfan 
This particular proposal only suggests that in future a canister will be able to be the controller of a neuron; in addition the materiality of canister controlled neurons is suggested to be monitored (because these are transferable). It is not suggested to facilitate transfer neurons from one controller to another (or merge neurons) as this would make all neurons transferable.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-05-21 08:45:10 UTC | #274

No, this is not part of the proposal. The proposal aims to reduce restrictions on neuron control, specifically allowing smart contracts (called canisters) to control neurons; this opens up several interesting use cases. However, it is not intended to encourage the development of neuron markets, in order to maintain the incentive for users to vote in the long-term interests of the protocol.

Hi, i have a concern about security of my funds, looks like Dfinity is not thinking on people like me that locked our ICP on the NNS without knowing after we created the internet identity and locking the tokens there, we wouldn’t be able to then put a hardware wallet (ledger)  to control that neuron, I’m not looking to sell or even interested in transfer it, my concern goes straight to SECURITY and how i want to manage my funds, please tell me I’m wrong and with this proposal i’ll be able to add a ledger wallet to my neuron already created with internet identity.

Otherwise Dfinity would be almost committing a crime by not allowing me to have possession of my assets and exposing them to a cyber attack, because I cannot eliminate the seed phrase either and assign a ledger as a recovery method. Please tell me with this ill be able to put a ledger to my neuron.

-------------------------

Jdcv97 | 2024-05-31 09:33:46 UTC | #276

Also i want to remove the seed phrase and add a hardware wallet, why Dfinity didn’t explain this damn things when you are just locking you fu kin g funds for 8 years !! This is incredible really, sorry for the word but this was never a concern for me as I thought internet identity was super secure, but reading another post on the forum @lastmjs make @bjoern explained that even the internet identity without using a ledger is not a place to store thousands of tokens, i have a huge investment here i’m so worried right now. My seed phrase could be vulnerable, I can’t put a ledger as recovery instead of that seed, and also I can’t put a ledger to my neuron. Come on this can’t be possible

If you tell me your seed phrase, I'll tell you if it's vulnerable ;)

Ah okay...so for example, this is not going to allow us to use a ledger instead of Internet Identity to protect our neurons?

Perhaps we should start another thread again discussing the security situation around II controlling neurons. It's a bit disheartening that we're just stuck with II and can't ever change to a more secure method of controlling our neurons.

Yes, I second this. I would like to see at least a separate thread/ forum post discussing this and let us give feedback/ vent. 

I also would like a more appropriate place to ask @wpb and Codegov questions related to this. For example, as of right now, the most secure method would be removing any access to your II leaving anything attached to it in a safe deposit box at a bank, and forgetting all about it unless I need to change my following. However, I want to be able to vote with that neuron and continuously need to access my safe deposit box and have a whole process... Especially, with talks of incentivising manual voting and docking a follower... It almost feels like someone could have their neuron/ II information stored at the bank, and be forced into following to keep no attachment to the II, but then be docked because we followed...

Maybe I'm not wrapping my head around all of it and that's why I'd like a separate post that goes into detail @lastmjs @bjoernek I hope what I said makes sense or you get my confusion/ urge for safe security practices. 

I do hear the development staff on the neuron markets and the complexity of the situation so don't take this as disrespect. I'm just confused... 

Also, @wpb does codegov consistently check the Revise Elected GuestOS Versions? I think I need to adjust, or is it that your neuron can sometimes cast the vote last minute?

PS. I'm not against offering individuals incentives for the work behind voting or "docking us". However, I just want a place for all these questions to play out as they relate to both posts in a way? Not sure if I'm explaining my confusion right... Let me know if I need to clarify.

You could use hotkeys to avoid the whole process.  Hotkeys enable you to vote, set Followees, toggle "automatically stake new maturity", toggle "participate in neurons fund", increase stake, and view voting history.  You can create and set a principal for an identity that has no asset value as a hotkey for any or all of your higher value neurons so you can use that principal to control the functions described above while leaving the higher value assets stored in a safe place such as a safety deposit box.

[/quote]
The CodeGov neuron votes on all IC-OS Version Election proposals within 2 days of the creation date of the proposal.  This includes the Revise Elected GuestOS Versions proposal type.  We have a self-imposed 48 hour deadline for the completion of our reviews and voting to ensure we are able to vote before DFINITY and to enable us to communicate to the ICP community what we found from our reviews with plenty of time for others to consider the information before they vote if they are interested.

This was very helpful...

I would still like a full additional post discussing as Jordan said,

I'll stop rambling and say it answered my immediate questions on this. Thanks again for getting back to me...

Just as a clarification: The level of security of II in my opinion hinges on _end device security_. If you use II on your day-to-day device, that device is pretty likely to be exposed to malicious software – and all operating systems and browsers tend to have security bugs from time to time. Such a device is also more likely to be lost or stolen from you. My concerns are really not about security issues of II as a protocol, but about _the security procedures for the end devices you use II with_.

My suggestion in such cases is to create two IIs, one that you use infrequently and from devices where you apply stricter security measures _to those devices_. That II can be used to hold more value. And one II that you use from your day-to-day devices to interact with all kinds of applications.

Hi @bjoernek and @bjoern, 

I'm just tagging you both since I don't think anyone else can answer this. I'm just curious what's the status on this proposal? Is it being looked at and worked on?

I ask because I hope to use the feature soon and I know others do too, so it could help me plan out tasks.

Thanks for any information.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2024-06-11 08:58:50 UTC | #284

Thank you for the follow-up @dfxjesse !

Yes the proposal the revaluation of neuron control restrictions  has been added to the roadmap and is been looked at. Adding @georgi and @daniel-wong from the NNS team in case they can give further insights.

-------------------------

daniel-wong | 2024-06-12 13:19:27 UTC | #285

Nice to see that people are eager for this to be implemented :grin:

I hope and believe that I'll have time to work on this pretty soon.

FWIW, I think the amount of work will not be large. Optimistically, I would estimate that the changes would be released in a couple of weeks or so, but please, take this with a grain of salt. (In general, estimation is hard.)

I will reply to this thread again after the uncertainty of those estimates is significantly reduced.

-------------------------

daniel-wong | 2024-06-13 14:09:25 UTC | #286

I am interested in chatting with people about their specific use cases. This may have been covered earlier in this thread, but it's pretty long, and maybe was not focused on this specific question. If you would like to maybe be mentioned in a future Global RnD, send me a private message.

I think one of the main uses is liquid staking. You can read more about it in our docs https://docs.waterneuron.fi/ or in our forum post introducing WaterNeuron: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-waterneuron/30897

The implementation of the MVP of this feature is now in the master branch. Therefore, this will be released as part of the next set of NNS canister upgrades.

In general, the NNS team proposes upgrades on Friday, and DFINITY usually votes in favor of those proposals on Monday.

# Next Steps

I will be on vacation for a couple weeks starting on Thursday. The NNS team is arranging for the rest of this to be taken care of while I am gone. I do not expect that they will need to do any additional work, other than be aware that this feature is being released, and stand by in case something happens, which seems unlikely.

There are some additional materiality metrics that I'd like to implement, but those will be released as "version 1.1", so to speak, of this feature. Someone else on the team might work on that while I'm on vacation, but I would assume it won't be done by the time I get back.
