Or wait until the IC collects per canister logs in a way that's accessible to canister admins. I wouldn't be surprised if it's somewhere on the roadmap, but a lot of things are.

Does the IC collect canister logs yet? This would be very nice.

I would like to see all errors, panics, and ic_cdk::print logs. It's been difficult to debug in production, I assume others find this difficult as well?

Wanted to follow up on whether Motoko `Debug.print` logs are collected and accessible on the IC main net. Would be very helpful.

I think youâ€™d need to use something like canistergeek.
