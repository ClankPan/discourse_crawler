Hello folks, I am specializing in writing games. As I develop and test, I will need the back-end (whether I am running it locally for on a public canister) to allow me pretend to be two or more players, so that I can make sure that the game will look and act correctly, on many player devices.  With the strict identity system will this be possible? What would be the best way to proceed?

Thank you,

If you are using Internet Identity you should be able to create multiple Identites and sign into your game using different browsers/incognito mode/devices
