Hi

I received this message when I was sending a query to a local canister after authenticating and getting Identity from Inter net Identity. I read that it is due to not having II and canister both running locally? or is it something else?
If this is right, is there a way to be able to use II and send local requests?

```
Failed to authenticate request 0x30fa2ff5c4e61c82cddbd6b7ce54348f5c08a2bbc28f877c84c1dfe80a4d7bfb due to: Invalid delegation: Invalid canister signature: IcCanisterSignature signature could not be verified:

You have to run II locally. The local replica does not currently know how to accept signatures from mainnet

when I use II create a local account in local,its also show:
403ï¼ŒFailed to authenticate request.
How to deal?
