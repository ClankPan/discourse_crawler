Hello there!

we are happy to announce that voting is now open for [a new IC release ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/rc--2023-07-05_23-01).
The NNS proposal is here: [IC NNS Proposal 123410 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123410).

Here is a summary of the changes since the last release:

* [[e0f5a6a86](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/e0f5a6a86)] Consensus: chore(ic-recovery): Export `subnet_splitting` as a library
* [[fa0a9f42a](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/fa0a9f42a)] Consensus: feat: set `halt_at_cup_height` to `false` during CUP creation.
* [[5d22efeef](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/5d22efeef)] Execution: chore: Add `allow_only_nns_subnet_sender` permission check for IC00 methods
* [[cf7eb6b39](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/cf7eb6b39)] Execution: chore: Add permissions for IC00Methods
* [[2ebc8bf41](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/2ebc8bf41)] Message Routing: fix: Drop StateSyncRef as late as possible
* [[73b9a04ae](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/73b9a04ae)] Networking: chore: Add tokio metrics prometheus collector
* [[fa4506dbd](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/fa4506dbd)] Networking: fix bitcoin adapter flakiness caused by header sync
* [[095308922](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/095308922)] Node: Use non-mainnet URL for dev SetupOS images
* [[207abf198](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/207abf198)] Runtime: Add a config flag for tracing message execution
* Various tech-debt management: code refactoring, docs, bug fixes, test updates

# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code
# This process requires an x86-64 based machine, Ubuntu 20.04 or a newer version of the OS, Git, and Podman.
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic
cd ic
git fetch origin
git checkout a17247bd86c7aa4e87742bf74d108614580f216d
if ./gitlab-ci/container/build-ic.sh -i ; then
    curl -LO https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/a17247bd86c7aa4e87742bf74d108614580f216d/guest-os/update-img/update-img.tar.gz
    shasum -a 256 artifacts/icos/guestos/update-img.tar.gz update-img.tar.gz
else
    echo "IC-OS build failed. Verification unsuccessful." >&2
fi
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of this replica update and our findings from the reviews can be viewed [in this post for proposal 123410](https://dscvr.one/post/1197961714254566080/nns-proposal-123410) in the CodeGov portal on DSCVR.  The CodeGov neuron 2649066124191664356 has voted to adopt proposal 123410.

At the time of this comment on the forum, there are still 2 days left in the voting period.  We encourage NNS voters to review the replica update proposal and vote manually.  Of course, you always have the choice to follow another person or another organization who is voting independently.  At this time, I am aware of [CodeGov.org (neuron ID 2649066124191664356)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/2649066124191664356?vh-s=100) and [Taggr Network (neuron ID 16737374299031693047)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16737374299031693047) who are performing this work, both of which are registered known neurons.  You can learn more about the CodeGov project at CodeGov.org and you can learn more about Taggr Network in [the NNS-GOV realm on taggr.top](https://taggr.top/#/realm/nns-gov) 

NOTE:  The CodeGov project would like to find additional reviewers to help with this work.  Since there is a 0.5 - 2 hour time commitment on the weekend for each proposal and our reviews require technical skills, we offer a bounty for every review that you perform that is competitive with typical developer contract work.  You are not required to review every proposal, but we encourage as much participation as your time allows.  Anyone who has the technical skill to perform the IC-OS verification and who is willing to perform a sanity check on the Release Notes is welcome to be a reviewer.  If you are interested, then please Apply at codegov.org.  The current bounty for this work can always be found in [this post](https://dscvr.one/post/11096526/current-bounties-for-reviewers) in the CodeGov portal.
