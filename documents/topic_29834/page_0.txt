In the past, my nns neuron does not receive its rewards from the network for one day. Usually, it comes the next day if a day is missed. At the moment, I have not received my rewards for the last three days. Can someone tell me why this happens to neuron?

Rewards for voting are not distributed immediately and can take up to a week to "average out" after a proposal voting period ends and is finalized. Please check back again in a week and let us know if the problem is still occurring. 

You can look up the neuron on the dashboard by searching for the neuron id to see the voting status: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/
or also you can try this https://f2djv-5aaaa-aaaah-qdbea-cai.raw.icp0.io/ for information.
