I am running into a few issues with `--specified-id`. First off, it would be nice if `--specified-id` could be set in the `dfx.json` for an individual canister, so that the command line option would not be necessary.

Also I'm running into an issue where if I use `--specified-id` for some canisters, but then try to simply deploy another canister without `--specified-id`, I am getting the error `Canister be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai is already installed`.

It seems like dfx is not appropriately finding new canister ids if the id is already taken by another canister.
