Sorry but from what I gathered [here](https://www.binance.com/en/activity/events/binanceblockchainweekparis2022) there is not a single speaker I'm interested to hear.

Looks like a echo chamber meeting to me.

Furthermore I'm kind of surprise that it takes place in Paris, as French tech is dead in the water nowadays, killed by a thoroughly idiotic politic.

To sum it up, it feels pointless to me :person_shrugging:

Speaking of Paris, there is an ICP and Web3 enthusiasts meetup this weekend. Highly recommend for those around!
