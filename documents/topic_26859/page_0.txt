Just a few days ago I made a post about my Stake still not being reimbursed.
And it's gone.
So now, again, this question: when am I going to get my ICP back that mysteriously disappeared.  Almost 10% of my initial stake is gone, I contacted DFinity support about this 19 (...) days ago and I was assured I would get it back.  This still hasn't happened yet.

What is going on here?  Why does this take so long?
And why did a similar post as this one get deleted/removed?
Thank you.

Hi, sorry to hear this. Is there a proof of hack or deduction?
