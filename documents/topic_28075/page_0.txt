Hello ICP Community!

The PADO Labs is excited to announce the final milestone of our first ICP grant. We have a working product which is deployed a couple of EVM blockchains, and the team has been monitoring and following the ICP ecosystem for a couple of years. This is our first time introducing PADO, the zk-attestation and computation project to the ICP community, and building the attestation registry and service for the ecosystem.

PADO’s vision is to liberate the potential of data and computation through cryptography.  We want to break down barriers between datasets, enrich smart contract functionalities, and enable secure monetization of personal data within privacy-protected data flows.

The core techniques used in PADO’s solutions include interactive zero-knowledge proofs (IZK), multiparty computation (MPC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The applications of off-chain private attestations cover sybil resistance, reputation and credit systems, proof-of-assets, verifiable recruitment, ads distribution, and more. In fact, we have worked with a couple of projects to launch PADO as a proof-of-humanity attestor to identify targeted users for applications. 

Within this grant, we have integrated the PADO’s extension product with the ICP community wallet and canisters to allow people to leverage the PADO’s capability, i.e., creating privacy-preserving and authentic web data attestations, and further submitting these attestations to the IC network. 

Future Plan:
We are looking into the full functionalities and improvements of the attestation registry, including the native support of on-chain signature verification, and more flexible access control of the on-chain attestations.

This is great. We really need compute over encrypted content and proof of humanity. Welcome!
