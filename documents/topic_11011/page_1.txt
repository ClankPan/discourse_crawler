My major problem with some of the post here is to lead to believe Dfinity and some poster here that if you leave your reward as maturity (or the new Staked maturity), you will never have to pay taxes on this and grow your wealth indefinitely, for decades, without never paying any taxes.  This is 100% wishful thinking.
It does not matter that the proposal passes or not.  What matter is how you will use it.
As an example, if you stake DOT, you will receive some DOT every few days.  Polkadot mint them and send them directly to your account.  It seems that everyone agree this is a reward taxable event.  IRS is convinced right now that you have to declare and pay taxes on those new DOTs.
Do you really think that because Dfinity has insert a middle trick in between, called maturity, that all investors will get away with taxes for decades, for ever?  Really?  Wishful thinking again.
Get in the lawmakers shoes for a moment. Do you think they will buy this little tweak and stay away from hundreds of millions, probably billions?  Wishful thinking.
Do you think the owners of the 26 millions ICPs, not minted yet and still in a maturity form, will get away with taxes and they can keep going like this for decades, for forever?
It is right to say that companies hire lawyers all the time and try to use all the tax code to their benefits.  But this is so misleading here for these reasons:
Most people are small investors, with no financial enough to hire these people
Those companies have a plan B if the strategy does not work and have money to go to court if they really believe in what they do.
They have money aside to pay if they end up to loose their case.
Their money and investments are not lock for 8 years anywhere.
This is not what we have here. We have fathers and mothers investing in order to upgrade their family life.  IF it does not work as Dfinity, Dominic or Ben Taylor tend to say  and they end up with huge tax bill, with compounded penalties and compounded interest to pay, what are they gonna do?  If the lawmakers and IRS don’t buy that maturity tweak trick, what will happen to them with all their ICPs locked for 8 years? 
You decision will be to be on the safe side or on the greedy side.  But at least, in this thread, you have both side of the medal and you will need to take your own decision.
And if ever lawmakers don’t buy the Dfinity trick and send bills to investors for their ICP maturity or minted ICP in 1, 2 or 3 years,  can you imagine the quantity of ICP that will be for sale (whatever will be available out of locked neurons obviously).  Another possibility would be to vote to unlock all neurons so people can sell and pay their tax bill. Can you imagine the ICP price then?
If you are a wishful thinker, you may say this is all impossible.   Well… TMO, this is very possible and plausible.  Up to you all to make your own opinion now.
I stand with @lastmjs  that that this proposal is a disaster and those wishful thinkers dream have good chances to come to an end.
Dfinity and his leaders and employees should stay away from creating tricks trying to avoid taxes (because this is exactly what this does) and if they cannot resist to do, they should warn investors of all possibilities accordingly. Taxes is not their business and you will never have my mind change on this.
Good luck to all wishful thinkers out there, because you will need it.

The whole point of on-chain governance is so we can tweak things as we go along.

In the grand scheme of things, the first design is very likely not the best design.

If we identify an area where IC's tokenomics or staking mechanisms can be improved, we should fix it, or at least strongly consider it.

This proposal seems complex because we all have a preexisting mental model of what staking means, and this proposal changes that. I don't think it's more complicated than the current system though, all things considered.

Anyways, I have yet to decide on whether to vote yes or no, but maybe we can amend the proposal to get rid of the +/-5% part but keep the rest? @jwiegley would that even make sense?

This proposal has many parts inside it. As we see now, the community may disagree with some parts. So having the proposal in parts, it may be better so we can see which parts are more acceptable and which not. 

I suggest it to be done in parts, so we can vote each sector of the proposal individually.

Hey everyone, this thread contains many good points and questions, and I hope to cover them. Discussions will roll on for a while. Big thanks to everyone who has taken the time to give their views so far.

I want to start by addressing the tax considerations, and whether it is appropriate for the design of neuron staking to be sympathetic to them.

**The case of a Seed investor who thought they faced major losses**

There was an engineer in California, who persuaded his mum to participate in the 2017 public "Seed" fundraiser. She had not sold anything at all. However, her CPA, who was a leading CPA in the Bay Area, told her that increases in maturity would be seen as equivalent to income by the IRS, and that whenever the maturity of her neurons had increased in the past, an income tax event had occurred. He claimed that each time maturity had increased, ordinary income was received equal to the "equivalent" number of ICP *multiplied by the market price of ICP the time*. Given the enormous early highs in the price of ICP, which were likely created by price manipulation on FTX in the hours before Genesis, she was told she had received a huge amount of income, even though she had received no cash receipts from sales, and owed an unaffordable amount of income tax. Consequently, she immediately began using her accumulated maturity to produce ICP, which she then liquidated on an exchange, and began liquidating her retirement accounts to cover the shortfall in funds needed to cover her assumed income tax liability. In addition, she placed all her neurons into dissolve mode to escape further financial danger as soon as possible. 

I spoke to the engineer after events were well in motion. I tried explaining that in my view, it was very unlikely that increases maturity were taxable ordinary income. There were two firewalls: (1) that receipt of staking rewards would not be taxable income, since newly minted tokens created through staking  were the product of collaborative creative effort, and normally, such product does not create income until sold, and (2) since maturity is only an attribute of neurons, its application is subject to the current design of the NNS, which self-updates, which means maturity cannot possibly be seen as equivalent to ICP tokens on the immutable ICP ledger.

Naturally, these arguments made informally had little effect, and they felt it necessary to heed the advice they were getting. Most holders of ICP do not have the necessary experience with tax law to draw their own conclusions. Meanwhile tax advisors hear the word "maturity" and instantly equate it to coupons on a bond, interest paid on a bank balance, or something similar. They have insufficient understanding of decentralized networks and blockchain and in the absence of external guidance draw faulty equivalences. Sophisticated tax lawyers will often draw different conclusions, but they are out of reach for most ICP holders. 

**Why I provided a tax analysis and proposal to harden the system**

I became aware of others in similar situations located around the world. Today, on an ongoing basis, there are people who are continually dumping ICP, even though this is not their preferred course of action, because they fear being unable to pay down income tax liabilities generated by maturity. We must feel for all individuals in this position, and more broadly, this is not good for the network's decentralized economy.

For such reasons, I realized that an analysis of the current situation should be provided, to provide those in this situation with input material that might be supplied to tax advisors and/or tax lawyers. In addition, I realized that the design should be further hardened, to make it even more difficult for any tax authority around the world to claim that increases in maturity represent ordinary income that should be immediately taxed. The post I made to propose changes, which is often referenced in this thread, can be found [here](https://medium.com/dfinity/proposal-to-improve-icp-governance-staking-re-tax-and-tokenomics-df09903a2e0b).

*In this thread, some are concerned that designing a tax efficient system is illegal "tax avoidance". Thankfully they are mistaken.* 

Whenever financial professionals design business frameworks, their designs always take into consideration the tax consequences, and this should also be the case when decentralized protocols are designed, since a key purpose is to allow widespread participation. Considering tax consequences in design is very clearly a form of tax planning, rather than tax avoidance. Tax avoidance involves people making efforts not to pay taxes that are legally due. Tax planning, by contrast, involves designing systems that work with existing tax frameworks in order to legally protect and further the interests of participants, which tax authorities encourage. Proposing design tweaks with the objective of ensuring those staking neurons are not subject to unfair income tax liabilities, when they have received no cash compensation to pay down those liabilities, is very clearly tax planning.

**The IRS has since accepted arguments made in the proposal**

Please see the tax analysis provided and nature of the proposal (or just search for "Taxation Of Proof-Of-Stake Staking Rewards" in the [post](https://medium.com/dfinity/proposal-to-improve-icp-governance-staking-re-tax-and-tokenomics-df09903a2e0b) if you have limited time). What's important is that the arguments involved are derived axiomatically from hard case law. As mentioned in the foregoing, there are two firewalls, which provide powerful foundations for legal argument where tax authorities unfairly claim increases in maturity represent income (and which can inform CPAs/accountants and tax lawyers advising neuron holders).

**The first firewall lays out the arguments why the receipt of staking rewards, generally, should not be treated as ordinary income, and why income is only generated when tokens received are sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of. The argument depends on accepted case law in the United States, but can be extended to nearly every tax system around the world. Thankfully, since the analysis and proposal was posted, it appears the IRS (the "Inland Revenue Service" is the primary tax authority in the USA) have accepted the arguments involved, and will not treat the receipt of staking rewards as income tax events. I have updated the post with links to this breaking news.** 

When my analysis and proposal was first posted, nearly every CPA/accountant in the USA would have advised that when tokens are received as staking rewards they immediately generate income tax liabilities. However, the correct tax treatment of such things derives from the law, and tax authorities cannot ignore the law when defining tax treatment. In this case, the IRS wanted to treat staking rewards as ordinary income, but presumably they were swayed by the same legal considerations that I made in my arguments. In this case, the law will hopefully have prevented those involved in staking in the USA being exposed to harmful financial situations. 

**Why we must care about these firewalls**

Although the first firewall appears to have succeeded in the USA, we should not be lulled into believing that the second firewall is not important. Firewalls should be made as numerous and strong as possible to protect participants in the Internet Computer's decentralized ecosystem. Furthermore, just because the IRS in the USA appears to have stopped at the first firewall, that does not mean tax authorities in other jurisdictions around the world will do the same, and we need to extend protection as far as possible.

It's tempting to make the ideological claim that tax considerations should play no part in decentralized network design. However, in practice that limits participation, ensuring that only community members in special locations like Puerto Rico, Portugal and Monaco can stake with financial safety. This surely makes the argument incompatible with the basic aims of decentralization. If it can be helped, we should do everything we can to provide for broad participation and protect our community and the decentralized token economy created by the network.

**Helping evolve an adaptive, self-directed blockchain**

We should aim to constantly refine and improve the decentralized protocols of the IC so as to lay ever better foundations for a thriving and growing network economy. That the IC self-directs and evolves using the NNS will potentially eventually prove a decisive advantage - and from day one, it has always been a clearly stated aim of this project to create an adaptive blockchain (see this [early post](https://medium.com/dfinity/the-dfinity-blockchain-nervous-system-a5dd1783288e) proposing a "Blockchain Nervous System"). We cannot shy from proposing improvements to the NNS framework and tokenomics without abandoning a founding objective of the project. 

Because the IC is adaptive, rather than enshrine ossified blockchain dogmas, it seeks to "win" through rapid evolution - including some degree of active experimentation. We can already see the advantages of this paradigm in the rapid release of new technical advances and features, such as the provision of capabilities derived from "chain key" cryptography to smart contracts that will allow them to create transactions on any blockchain without holding private keys, and turnkey Service Nervous System DAO functionality for dapps, among many other things. No other blockchain on earth advances nearly as fast as the Internet Computer, and eventually, once the price manipulation, FUD and press boycotts fade, and the incredible services being built by our organically growing community begin to make their mark, this will begin to tell.

**Thinking about the most controversial feature**

In the proposal, when maturity is used to produce new ICP, the quantity of ICP created some days in the future is modulated by ICP price trends. This makes it near impossible for tax authorities to draw a simple equivalence between increased maturity and ICP tokens received and thus claim that maturity represents income received that has created a tax liability. I hope that the foregoing highlights why this is important for large parts of the community, in order to help prevent them being exposed to unavoidable tax liabilities they have no control over, and also for the wider community, who suffer when others feel forced to dump ICP on the markets to mitigate the risks. However, there is also another dimension to this feature. 

The modulation feature increases the amount of ICP produced from maturity by up to 5% if the markets are rising, and decreases the amount of ICP produced from maturity by up to -5% if the markets are falling (to understand the full details, please refer to other posts in this thread). This is possible because the NNS is made aware of the price of ICP and various fiat exchange rates by the submission of proposals, which enables it to transform ICP into cycles at a constant rate, where ICP worth 1 [SDR](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx) produces 1 trillion cycles, such that the cost of computation remains constant for those building dapps and services (note: although currently the NNS learns of external exchange rates through proposals submitted to it, soon it will inform itself by using HTTP outcalls that pass through consensus). As well as hardening the second firewall, this feature also creates incentives for neuron holders.

The system creates a small incentive to use maturity to produce and sell ICP when the market is rising, since more ICP will be received, than when it is falling, when less ICP will be received. In a more mature market, this (or at least some more sophisticated later variant created through the ongoing evolution of the network) might exert a significant stabilizing effect on the market, which is beneficial for adoption of ICP. A concern about this feature, which has already been raised in this thread, is that it is unfair for those wishing to sell during a market decline to receive less ICP than those selling when the market is rising. However, in practical terms, there is a strong counter argument. 

Those wishing to sell, will exchange ICP for some other thing of value, most often fiat currency that can be used in the off-chain world. If the overall volume of selling in a downmarket is reduced by this feature, then the price those selling receive for their ICP may be higher. Simply put, often times while those using maturity to produce ICP for sale may receive, say, 5% less ICP in a steeply falling market, the price they receive for their ICP might be 5% or greater higher, and thus overall they will actually do better.

Such economic reasoning is difficult to make work, and its incorporation into tokenomnics schemes pushes into uncharted territory, but that does not mean designs should not take such reasoning into consideration. Decentralized protocols create public networks that survive and thrive by merit of their decentralized economies (even if today, token price often largely derives from conceptions and misconceptions carefully cultivated in the popular imagination, since this will eventually change). The Internet Computer is not a simple blockchain like Bitcoin - it aims to provide a universal public compute layer for the world, so that everything can be built using smart contracts. Today, the remarkable efficiencies of its architecture allow smart contracts to serve HTTP, and data and data processing to be moved on-chain, among other advances. Innovation and evolution should not be limited to things like chain key cryptography, but also involve its tokenomics, even though this too is a complex and difficult area.

We must constantly optimize, not least because the Internet Computer holds continual evolution as a core feature through the Network Nervous System. This allows for iteration where some measured risks can be taken, because the network is adaptive and designs can be refined, on an almost continuous basis, R&D contributions allowing, or if necessary, even reverted if they are not working. We should avoid be distracted by sacred cows and popular blockchain dogmas. The ability of this network to continually evolve along all design axes will prove a decisive strength. The Network Nervous System is what makes the Internet Computer blockchain self-directed and adaptive, and we should also embrace its own rapid evolution, and the evolution of next-generation tokenomics.

First of all, I would like to thank everyone contributing to make the IC better. I understand that everyone has his viewpoint and each one of us wishes the best for the Internet of the future.

I would like to propose an idea, hoping it will contribute for the better: Is it complex on the technical side to have two types of neurons? We could have a “Simple Neuron” and a “Advanced Neuron”.

1. “Simple Neuron” - this would have simple features: simple maturity process (like it’s today, without price modulation rewards), spawn function, merge maturity and maybe no auto-compounding.
2. “Advanced Neuron” - this one will have all the new features: two types of maturity, stake maturity, exchange maturity, auto-compounding, price modulated rewards etc.

Each user can choose his type of Neuron at the beginning when the Neuron gets created, and it can’t be changed until the dissolve delay is finished.

The discussion in this topic (including the other thread about the original proposal of @dominicwilliams) I’ve seen that there are some community members who want to use Neuron rewards for everyday expenses: rent, holidays etc., who usually don’t have high staking which could lead to selling pressure. This way we would have those who stake inside “Simple Neurons”, and don’t worry about price-modulated rewards.

On the other hand, we would have those who use “Advanced Neurons” which are more tax-friendly, but come with price-modulated rewards.

I also want to mention the fact that we could introduce a maximum cap for “Simple Neurons”, to avoid high staking for this type of Neurons. Some whale could create many “Simple Neurons”, but all this comes with less features (like no auto-compounding) which makes managing a big number of this type of Neurons harder (having to merge maturity for each one of them everyday; spawning rewards and waiting each one to get dissolved etc.)

Furthermore I’d like to mention that some community members who live in muslim-law countries, can’t use this new staking system, because of price-modulated features, which are considered prohibited gambling. So we will have less staked ICP and less decentralisation because of less voting Neurons. If we are to take in consideration the US community for their taxes, shouldn’t we also consider those community members as well, who, in some way, will get banned from staking and voting?

Using this system of two types of neurons, we would give to the community the freedom to choose what suits them, have more ICP staked and a more decentralised voting system.

The idea could be elaborated more, but I didn’t have time to write or think deeper on this.

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2022-02-27 01:17:07 UTC | #113

@coteclaude - I wasn't going to respond to this, but I had already drafted the below in a private conversation so I figured I'd share here, too. To be clear, I am not offering anyone tax advice: ***I'm not a tax lawyer and I haven't read the tax code***. I'm just a guy who has done some research on the subject. 

****

The central question is: *when* are rewards taxable as income? For rewards on the Internet Computer, the possible answers are: (1) when “maturity” accrues; (2) when new ICP is minted, either through the “merge” function or the “spawn neuron” function; (3) when the newly minted ICP is no longer locked in a neuron; or (4) when the newly minted ICP is sold.

For tax purposes, income in the US is realized whenever there are “instances of [1] undeniable accessions to wealth, [2] clearly realized, and [3] over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.” *Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.* , 348 U.S. 426 (1955); *see also* [IRS Chief Counsel Advice memo 202114020](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/202114020.pdf) (“The date of receipt and fair market value to be included in income will be dependent on when the taxpayer obtained dominion and control over the” cryptocurrency).

The IRS has provided [guidance](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-19-24.pdf) on what the term “complete dominion” means in the context of airdrops. It has said: “B has dominion and control of Crypto S … when it is recorded on the distributed ledger, because B immediately has the ability to dispose of Crypto S.” That is of course non-binding: it is merely guidance. But it is persuasive, nonetheless.

That definition of “dominion and control” indicates that maturity alone is not taxable as income because it is not recorded on the ledger, nor can you dispose of maturity. I understand that people here are weary of that argument because you can seemingly convert maturity to ICP at any time. But that’s not entirely true: you need to have at least 1 ICP worth of maturity to convert it. Moreover, the way it works is that you have to ask the decentralized network to convert your maturity to ICP: the rules of the network could be changed at any time to prohibit someone from converting maturity to ICP.

Moreover, assuming arguendo that maturity is the equivalent of ICP (it's not), it still doesn't fall under the definition. Under the current system, if you convert maturity to ICP, the ICP is controlled by a non-transferrable neuron for 7 days. Thus, you don’t have control over the ICP you minted: the network controls it for 7 days.

There are also practical reasons why maturity should not be considered income. I won’t dive deep into those reasons, but some are: (1) a token holder might only want to participate in governance and not actually receive any rewards, and therefore never actually convert maturity to ICP; (2) prices of crypto tokens are highly volatile, and the price of ICP when you have “maturity” might be substantially different from the price of ICP when you are actually able to sell the ICP that you minted with your maturity; (3) taxing maturity would require people to convert maturity to ICP daily. The list goes on.

My personal view is also that “merging” maturity is not taxable, either. But I recognize that it is a much closer call. Merging maturity actually creates new ICP on the ledger, but it is not under the control of the person who “merged”: the ICP is given to a “neuron” that is controlled by the system, and cannot be transferred or sold. Thus, I don’t think that merging fits the requirements outlined by the IRS’s definition of dominion and control.

The wrinkle, though, is that the user who merged could have instead spawned a new neuron. So although the user doesn’t have control of the ICP, an argument could be made that the user exercised control when it locked up the ICP in a neuron instead of spawning it. I disagree with that argument because to me that “control” element means control over the ICP itself *after* it has been added to the ledger. If the ICP is in a neuron, you cannot possibly control it: you cannot transfer it, you cannot sell it, you can only use it to vote on proposals.

As I read it, the proposal Dom/Dfinity made recognizes the ambiguity I’ve outlined above, and seeks to tweak the system so that rewards fall squarely outside of the requirements for taxable income until the rewards are actually converted to ICP that can be sold for fiat.

**Edit**: The more I think about it, the more clear it becomes to me that the "clearly realized" prong is actually the most important prong in the analysis. I came across an old Supreme Court case that found that shareholders did not "realize" income when they received a *stock* dividend (as opposed to a regular dividend, which comprises cash payments from the company to the shareholders) from the company whose shares they held.  *See Eisner v. Macomber*, 252 U.S. 189 (1920).  There, the court reasoned: "Stock dividends ... merely give the shareholders additional pieces of paper to represent the same equitable interest; they do not transfer assets or create new priorities among the security-holders. The total value of the common shares, though now spread out over a larger number of units, is left unchanged from its previous level. In effect, nothing of substance has occurred." 

The Internet Computer is not a company, nor is ICP a stock--ICP is the right to vote in the Internet Computer's governance. But I think that *Eisner* is more or less directly on point. There, the company created and distributed shares in the company (which gives shareholders collectively control of the company) to existing shareholders; here, the NNS creates and distributes governance tokens (which give tokenholders collectively control of the Internet Computer) to existing token holders. There, the new shares diluted the voting power of existing shares; here, the newly minted ICP dilutes the voting power of existing ICP.  There, the market cap of the company as a whole theoretically did not change when the stock dividend was issued--just the value of each individual share; here, the market cap of ICP shouldn't change when new ICP is minted (because ICP, as a governance token, theoretically derives its value from the right to govern the Internet Computer). 

@dominicwilliams, you might want to add the *Eisner* case to your memo.

Dominic

Thanks for coming on this thread. That was really needed. Please be aware that everything in all my posts are written with respect to everyone views.

Just so you know, I am a huge fan and investor in ICP. I keep promoting hard and have many friends that have invested because of me. I have invested much more then what I can afford to loose. We are all in over 50% lost right now but do not care and keep explaining my friends not to care either. The tech is phenomenal to me and price will get there anyway.

First of all, I need to correct **your biggest mistake in this post.** here you say *:* ***it appears the IRS (the “Inland Revenue Service” is the primary tax authority in the USA) have accepted the arguments involved, and will not treat the receipt of staking rewards as income tax events.*** **This is WRONG. They have not accepted anything.**

**Please reed the article from** ***professor of law and the academic director of the Graduate Tax Program at the University of California, Irvine School of Law*** and posted on Coindesk: It says expressly otherwise.

https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/taxweek/2022/02/08/your-staking-rewards-are-still-taxable/

I would tend to say that this professor have more knowledge then you, me and @bentaylor combined.

I hate to pay taxes as much as anyone. I hate how the government is using my money for things I also hate. I also feel the pain of that California mom who is stuck to pay taxes. Her and her son should have made more due diligence and stay on the safe side. Easy to say afterwards though.

This is exactly what I am trying to avoid here, another huge tax mistake, but at a much, much larger scale, for many more people. I have the same wishful thinking as you and all other readers here. The only difference is I am fully aware this is all wishful thinking. Programming a tweak to avoid paying hundreds of millions of taxes to uncle Sam will never pass through. It may take some time, but the end result will be the same. This is exactly why IRS have offered a check to this Tennessee couple. They are using all the time to be well prepared and win over the rewards staking taxes.

So my argument does not worth much than yours. Then, because I am a positive person, I suggest a solution.

Before programming and voting on anything, why don’t Dfinity approach the 2 largest tax firm in US (Deloite and KPMG), and get a recommendation letter from them. This thread would be very useful for them as well. Then your recommendation would have much more credibility and chances to avoid catastrophic consequences for many investors would be lowered by much.

Honestly and I hope I am wrong but I think you won’t do this because you are afraid that this may not support all you are writing here, and probably be the total opposite.

Again, I really hope I am wrong and would be so happy to be.

**Can we do this before anything else? Deloite and KPMG? It would be well worth for all investors.**

It seems that Dfinity is trying to repair a mistake of 2017 (not disclosing to seed investors that they should be very carefull with their taxes) by a much bigger mistake, tweaking the system to avoid taxes TMO.

Let’s do this please. Take a couple of weeks for Deloitte and KPMG to share their views with us.

Hey Dominic, thank you for this post.  It is very helpful to my consideration of this proposal.  I think you have made sound arguments that strongly support the proposal.  It's good to see you in the community offering your perspective on important topics.

chances to avoid catastrophic consequences for many investors
[/quote]

Hello.  I do appreciate your genuine concern for the proposals.  Based on your posts, it may be fair to say that you believe tax authorities might view maturity, and/or the act of merging maturity back into neurons, as a taxable event.  It also seems your position is that all, not some, of the proposals will definitely not be a firewall to the taxable event conclusion that tax authorities may reach regarding maturity or merged maturity.

If what I said is accurate regarding your viewpoint (proposals won't change a thing regarding taxation), then what difference would it make, in your opinion, if neuron holders have these additional maturity mechanisms at their disposal?  No matter what, we're still possibly on the hook for maturity taxation, is what you believe, correct?

Therefore, what would be the "catastrophe" if any one of these proposals was enacted?  Taxation outcome will still be identical to the current situation, in your opinion, correct?

Side point: I don't believe anyone who has contributed to the discussion, including supporters of the proposals, have ever said that the proposals will result in absolutely, positively no tax liability. I think everyone's comments have recognized that when a person disperses neuron(s) and ultimately chooses to convert to a Fiat currency, they absolutely will pay taxes as a result.

Thanks in advance for your reply!

coteclaude | 2022-02-26 02:33:33 UTC | #117

Hello and thank you for your reply. We are on the same page all the way except your last sentence, where I see something very important missing.

***"I think everyone’s comments have recognized that when a person disperses neuron(s) and ultimately chooses to convert to a Fiat currency, they absolutely will pay taxes as a result."***  

Yes, but the first tax event , (in my view, in IRS view, in my fiscal lawyer view, and in the California CPA view Dominic was talking about) is trigger as soon as you receive maturity.  

Here is from Dominic own post;

***"However, her CPA, who was a leading CPA in the Bay Area, told her that increases in maturity would be seen as equivalent to income by the IRS, and that whenever the maturity of her neurons had increased in the past, an income tax event had occurred. He claimed that each time maturity had increased, ordinary income was received equal to the “equivalent” number of ICP *multiplied by the market price of ICP the time"***

By coincidence, this is exactly what my own fiscal lawyer told me last December after the analysis of the system and my neurons, without any hesitation.

And TMO, to make it difficult for them to get the exact value will not be a successful trick to avoid the taxable event. This one is only personal opinion.

And like I said in previous post, does not really matter if the proposal passes or not.  It is up to each investors to manage their maturity as a tax event or not.  It is not a secret here that the proposed programming goal is to avoid tax. It is clearly stated by John in the first post ( * How to avoid incurring a tax burden;).  It may not work that way though. And if it does not work as planned by Dominic and it end up working like IRS want to, then it would be the catastrophic consequence I was talking about for many investors if they were accumulating clear of all taxes..

I still propose to take some little extra time to handle the situation professionally and  hire strong fiscal firms (KPMG, Deloite or better both) and have their interpretation and recommendation about how this should be handled.  Then we could vote with appropriate knowledge on the changes or not.

I will share my guess:  They would tell us that the maturity should be a tax trigger event (like the California CPA of a lead firm) and we should not bother with that maturity at all.  Only my guess, not to displease anyone.

Don't get me wrong, I don't like that either.  I would be everyone's dream to grow maturity, with no taxation, leading to an incredible untaxed wealth.  I am locked for 8 years, not dissolving.  But I am a realistic person.  Better to be safe then sorry. Again, I hate pay taxes more then all the posters here combined.

The only way I could be affected is if in few years, lots of investors end up having to pay huge amount of taxes and tank the price by selling as much as everyone can.  This is how I can be affected.  But it would be temporary anyway.

I choose the safe side.

Thanks for your clarification!

It would seem, therefore, that your position is that the potential "catastrophic consequence" does not inherently lie with the governance proposals themselves, not due to their very nature or mechanism. 

Rather, I can conclude that your point is that you, me, and everyone else that is receiving maturity will experience serious problems with our respective tax authorities if we don't think of our maturity as taxable events right now - no matter if we stake maturity, merge maturity, disperse maturity, keep maturity and do nothing with it - no matter the maturity proposals, options, or "levers" we decide to pull.  

And furthermore, it would seem prudent, in your viewpoint, if everyone make certain personal tax decisions relative to the viewpoint that maturity = taxable event.  Correct?

Your comments reflect a genuine concern!  And not just for ICP neuron holders who receive maturity through staking, but for all persons that stake any kind of crypto and receive some kind of "benefit".

Dominic Williams produced a defence of his proposal which says nothing much new, aside from the story of a clueless mother who faced an unexpected tax burden. It is more a reiteration of his position than a response to comments by the community. The one place he makes a new point is his contention that constant optimisation is a good thing, and is built into the very foundation of ICP. It is what makes ICP adaptable and therefore better than other chains.
I believe this is true when it comes to technical optimisations, which includes things like BTC integration, HTTPs requests by canisters, Canisters holding ICP and many excellent advances made in the past few months.
However, there are also aspects of governance that the community needs to be very wary of changing. These are a different order of alterations from technical ones. Technical changes in general are unanimously considered improvements but changes in governance can be a matter of ideology rather than simply technical operation. The very idea that Dfinity allows shifts in the way tokens are treated is anathema for many in the crypto community. The fact that Dfinity could, if it wanted, take away our tokens is a deal-breaker for many. Therefore, the ability to change tokenomics must be seen as a double-edged sword. The more fiddling there is to deal with individual jurisdictional issues, the weaker the entire system appears. 
We could have rolled back a particular transaction to return 40k ICP to an owner who had proved his ICP was stolen. His proposal failed because it was a 'thin-end-of-the-wedge' issue: if we roll back for this do we roll back for every such incident? The current debate is not that different, although more people are involved. One could easily ask, "why did investors not do due diligence?" because maturity was obviously likely to be a taxable event. If a trusting mum bought the token based on her engineer son's recommendation, well, it's the son's fault, isn't it? He is the engineer, he should have known better, and he should sort it out. In the end, she will make a big profit anyway, so I'm not fussed.

Can we schedule a live Community Conversation for this proposal?

I think a slideshow with a Q&A session will definitely help clear up confusion. There's some misunderstanding over what this proposal actually does and what it does not, I think.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-02-26 08:44:04 UTC | #121

@jzxchiang @OVVOVVO 
I come back to the problems @jwiegley is referring to:

***# Objective***

***## The Problem***

***Those with ICP staked in neurons face two main challenges when dealing with the maturity they earn as a result of voting rewards:***

**1- How to avoid incurring a tax burden;**
**2- How to compound maturity with the least manual effort.**

I will make 2 separate post for these 2 problems.  They seem quiet simple to me.

The first one is "How to avoid incurring a tax burden".  John will correct me if I understand it wrong but my actual understanding is that the "Burden" is the fact investors would have to manage and sell some ICP (or pay otherwise) as the minting of ICP from maturity is triggering a tax event.  Dfinity assume that leaving as maturity would eliminate this trigger and the burden associated with it.  Is this correct @jwiegley ?

My problem is that Dfinity have not provided any supportive documentation from a qualified and reliable tax firm to support their position. So there are possibilities that maturity is a taxable event and this proposal would not have to be voted as it would not achieve the goal.  So I believe doing the things right would be to obtain such a supportive recommendation from a reliable tax firm first.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-02-26 09:11:46 UTC | #122

**2- How to compound maturity with the least manual effort.**

This is much different and I am against this. Dfnity and the community is stating loud and clear IC is decentralize and controlled by the governance.  With this new programming, I could follow ICPM for voting in the governance and check the box Merge automatically, and logout from my account.  I can be years without accessing my account, with no clue what is going on with the network, with no clue about what is voted or not and I could not give a dam... because I still get rewarded the same as all the people who, like me, take few minutes everyday to read all governance proposal, understand the impact of them and vote on it.
If it was only me, I would make the opposite.  Eliminate the following option for governance, Create a check box on every governance proposal "I have read and understand the impact of this proposal" and be forced to vote manually.
With this programming, good chances that 99% of investors will follow one of the 3 leaders (ICPM, etc) and check the box to compound automatically.  So a handful of people will vote and all the others are only followers with the vast majority having no clue about what is going on.
Dfinity have always stated that you get reward because you are voting.  When you don't access your account for months or years and get the rewards just the same, this is not voting for me, and not fair for the investors that are really voting.
My 2 cents view only.
I am wondering of there are other people looking at this like me or if I am the only single one?

Edit:  This one cannot harm investors like the maturity could do.  Way less important in that sense.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-02-26 10:28:24 UTC | #123

So to reiterate,  according to the leading CPA firm referenced to in this topic by Dominic advised, every grant of maturity is taxable when it happens.

This is also the advice given to many others, as per their post, in this topic by presumably independent CPAs/Financial Advisors etc.

If we don't believe them, we owe it to ourselves to have hire strong financial firms like KPMG AND/OR Deloitte and get ADDITIONAL EXPERT opinion.

I think you are right that a lot of people can be wary of change and have anathema to changes in how tokens are treated.  Yet these kinds of changes just happened in a big way and I don’t observe people complaining about it.  

Specifically, a proposal was presented in November to change proposal weights, which gave governance proposals significantly higher value.  It was deliberated for 2 weeks before if was submitted the the NNS.  Very few votes were cast against it and little of the deliberation was in opposition.  It has now been implemented and voting rewards have changed in big ways for everyone.  Those who vote on Governance topics are getting much higher voting rewards and those who do not are getting a lot less.  The pie didn’t get bigger, it’s just getting sliced differently based on participation.  

This was a governance change that has major token distribution implications.  Some people who did complain originally, or were at least wary of change, seem to have become supporters of the change.  I do understand and respect the need to be wary of change, but I’m not observing that the system is becoming weaker due to change.  In fact, it is my opinion that the system is becoming stronger because we have the ability to make changes to the tokenomics and everyone who participates in governance is doing so according to what they perceive to be the long term best interest of the IC.  

I think the fact that our tokens are locked helps in this regard.  When anyone commits to staking ICP, they must do so knowing that they cannot leave just because they don’t like a change.  The entire system is mutable through NNS governance proposals.  I think that drives us to stay in the conversation and argue pros and cons of a wide variety of changes and in the end the system will move in the direction that the majority believes adds value.  I personally think the mutability through governance is a major strength of ICP.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-26 18:54:06 UTC | #125

I understand what you are saying about how auto compounding enables more passive investing, which is the opposite of what we should want.  However, setting a Followee and forgetting would be a bad strategy because you could come back 9 months later and find that you are not getting rewards because you are not voting.  For example, someone could submit a proposal that changes a default Followee relationship from All Topics to All Topics Except Governance and give higher weight to Governance proposals.  Or perhaps you set a Followee that you believe will vote on everything on your behalf and they don’t do that for some reason.  For sure many people will seek a passive strategy, but there are no promises that NNS governance and tokenomic policies will stay the same.  Hence, it is still up to each individual to participate in whatever way they feel is in their best interest.  I like the auto compounding feature.  Any passive investors who use it must still remain aware of what is going on and respond accordingly, else they risk losing profitability of their investment. Diligence is still required by every participant in NNS governance even with auto compounding.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-02-26 15:49:06 UTC | #126

The first time I looked at the tokenomics it was apparent that giving the same importance to exchange rate related transactions and to consequential governance decisions made no sense. There were many things that only Dfinity was equipped to do, and it made no sense to oppose the foundation in those matters. On the other hand, taking some power away from Dfinity was imperative in other areas.The change helped decentralisation. In my view any shift that promotes decentralisation without endangering security is good. 
So, yes, I am not saying changes in tokenomics should never be made. What I am questioning is Dominic Williams' failure to separate changes in tokenomics from technical advances in his idea of malleability.

**DON’T BELIEVE ME**

On this last post, I am recommending that you guys don’t believe me on anything I wrote about the tax. It has never been a better time to do your own research.

On Monday morning, why don’t you take a screen shot of the maturity screen, send it to your accountant, tax firm or tax advisor, explain him (or her) clearly how the reward system works and ask him his opinion on how you should manage these maturity rewards.

This would clearly help to make the right vote for this proposals.

Would be nice if you come back and share your tax advisor meeting here then after.

The best would be to hire a reliable and reputable tax firm by Dfinity but I have no faith that this will happen.

Have a good week end to all

Taxation seems to be the main driver for this proposal.

I am convinced that changing business economics of an entity to optimise for taxation to benefit a **subset** of current stakeholders of that entity is not a good idea in general.

I state this as a generalised rule I believe in. That said, I think it very much applies to the Internet Computer taxation discussion currently going on.

Even more so, as the Internet Computer is designed to be a GLOBAL compute platform for decades to come.

Global, trusted, fair, predictable, decentralised.

So, why mess with economics so early in the life of IC to optimise taxation for one (albeit large) country?

What about the other 190+ countries globally? Do we invent and implement tax optimised solutions for all of them, too? Is this leading to a in-fight between IC communities in different jurisdictions!? Instead of working together to make and keep IC successful?

How many taxation changes are happing every year around the globe? Dozens!? Do we change course every time a taxation change might effect IC holders somewhere on the globe?

Would small country communities ever be able to win enough votes for their (globally marginally representative) needs regarding taxation changes?

We are very early into IC.

Don’t mess with it now, while decentralisation is still very weak!

I suggest an alternative route: invest into educating your countries tax authorities. This is something everybody globally can do. Without messing with a global platform in the interest of few!

Hello!  Please clarify with specifics why 

1. You believe the exercise of proposed maturity options will, by design, only benefit a minority of certain neuron holders if enacted.

2.  You believe they cannot be at least potential firewalls to taxation overreach in more than one country's tax system.

Thanks in advance for your reply!

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-02-28 14:59:16 UTC | #133

What I don't understand how the current tokenomics mitigate the concerns we have with the proposed changes. If people are worried about maturity could be considered taxable, couldn't they simply continue doing what they currently do now? Sell the maturity you receive to pay for taxes if you think they are taxable? This whole thing is too complicated.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-02-28 08:12:16 UTC | #134

I think this counter from @Dylan is one of the biggest flaw’s in the current proposal. 

Dom’s argument that price modulation obfuscates the price and so income won’t be recognized by the tax authorities feels shakey at best. 

Why can’t tax authorities just tax at 95% of the value and then do a true up when minting occurs? In the US we currently estimate our taxes on a quarterly basis and then do a true up at year end. 

Estimations for tax are not new. The government would rather get 95% than nothing at all. 

Can folks who don’t agree explain why?

-------------------------

trishgill | 2022-02-28 10:56:44 UTC | #135

Hi I'm new here too. 

I would like raise an issue with the price modulation proposal. If, as I assume, that the price being referred to is the price of ICP in USD, then this creates a problem for all investors who trade instead in EUR or GBP. Not only does the proposal mkae it hard to know what your staking reward is in ICP, it adds FX risk.  For example, it is possible that, due to changes in the USD-EUR rate, that the price of ICP could fall in USD while rising in EUR.
How are small investors outside the US expected to hedge their (unknown and unknowable) FX exposure?
 
To my mind the proposal adds unnecessary complexity  and is too US centric, meaning that it may not even work as intended for ICP stakers outside the US.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-02-28 14:58:18 UTC | #136

I have moved from being against the proposal to being for it. I am no tax experts but I see many people are pointing out potential issues or concerns without providing a solution to address the problem it is trying to solve. We're all speculating what tax authorities may or may not do. I will vote for it if there is a chance that it addresses some of the issues with tokenomics and people liquidating ICP to pay taxes. We can always change things if they don't work out. It's an evolving protocols that move fast.

jwiegley | 2022-02-28 18:08:20 UTC | #137

[quote="coteclaude, post:121, topic:11011"]
Dfinity assume that leaving as maturity would eliminate this trigger and the burden associated with it. Is this correct @jwiegley ?
[/quote]
It's not for me to state what DFINITY assumes, so I would recommend re-reading Dom's medium post and his reply above about this proposal. Taxation is mentioned frequently in both places, so it is definitely a strong motive behind these changes.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-02-28 18:45:56 UTC | #138

The more I think about this proposal, the more I think this option should be included in the proposal from the beginning : 

[quote="jwiegley, post:3, topic:11011"]
*not in this proposal* : staked maturity → staked ICP
[/quote]

This option would allow people to take advantage of the auto compounding AND to stay into a "staked ICP" grammar. 

The articulated concepts are the same as in the other ones, so they not involve any complexification, just like this other possibility does not involve complexification, since it is what people currently does :

[quote="jwiegley, post:3, topic:11011"]
*not in this proposal (was `merge_maturity` )* : maturity → staked ICP
[/quote]

So here is my question : since we consider to separate the proposal into parts, could we include at least the 5th possibility into the governance proposal ? Idealistically, we would set 6 proposals, correlative to these options described by @jwiegley 

[quote="jwiegley, post:3, topic:11011"]
* `exchange_maturity` : maturity → staked maturity + staked ICP → liquid ICP
* `stake_maturity` : maturity → staked maturity
* `disburse_maturity` : maturity → liquid ICP
* *not in this proposal (was `merge_maturity` )* : maturity → staked ICP
* *not in this proposal* : staked maturity → staked ICP
[/quote]

And we would add the price modulation feature as another proposal. 

By shooting these 6 features in "one time", we would avoid differed proposals which could bring confusion precisely because of the fact they are differed : people would get used to using the new system, and once they would handle the new system, a new proposal would come to modify things, even if it is just to complete it.

The exhaustivity of these options described by @jwiegley is here compatible with harmony, pragmaticity and even beauty, it is rare we have them gathered, so let us not deprive us of it !

"It is hoped that these changes will improve the tax situation "

hoped? you are just throwing shit at the wall hoping it sticks?

i've already spent enough money on tax lawyers and a system for daily accounting of rewards.  have you consulted with actual, real tax lawyers in various jurisdiction or are you hoping that you all somehow magically have come up with something that actually solves the issue definitively?

there are literally 100s of tax codes in the world.  just leave it be and let folks sort out for themselves.  anyone with half a brain would realize they could move these staking coins to a corporate structure in a very low corp tax jurisdiction and avoid paying tax.  Estonia comes to mind as a country that has no corp tax on retained earnings....

ffs you don't need to write code trying to capture some magical no tax unicorn when there already exist mechanisms for this!

go focus on more constructive things for the ecosystem than this.

and if you plan on carrying on with this at the very least go get the opinion of a few highly reputable global tax accounting firms!!!

I find it totally unprofessional that something like this would be considered without analysis by some heavy weight firms as to whether or not it would bring the desired result.  

can we please get some tax professionals involved before you engineers run off and make some rube goldberg tax avoidance device...

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-01 02:38:19 UTC | #141

Genuine question: which tax professional in the world has an answer to this?

Dominic provided a reasonable argument why maturity (especially post-proposal) does not meet the standard set out by Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass, 348 U.S. 426 (1955) for taxable income.

Nobody, including the IRS, knows whether it does or does not. If they maintain that it does not, then someone will sue. Nobody knows what the court will decide then...

What we can do is act on what we do know. We do know this standard is widely accepted for determining whether something is taxable income (in the US at least), and we do know how the NNS works. If we think we have a better system that makes maturity better meet the standard, then I think we should do it.

Also, it's not like this proposal introduces any additional tax liability... Maturity in the current system may very well be ruled as taxable income even if we don't act...

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-01 02:47:39 UTC | #142


with all the respect for Dominic, KPMG and Deloite are, at least for me, a much better reference for tax law interpretation than Dominic himself.
They would certainly give us a much better advice on how to act until everything clarify and would make all investors much more confident on how to act with the maturity. It can only be beneficial for all investors.  What does Dfinity have to loose to have a consultation with one of them?  I just don't get it.
Why the rush?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-03-01 04:28:20 UTC | #143

@jzxchiang 

According to the "leading CPA firm" referred to by Dominic,  increasing maturity is an taxable event. This is also consistent with other financial advice that others have reported in this topic. 

The implications of relying on whether certain other methodology of calculating maturity that may or may not be taxable would have very significant implications for each person. This opinion should be clearly worded, unambiguous and from a financial authority. This is all that i think the common theme. Ask the competent authorities of their professional opinion. Is this too much to ask?

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2022-03-01 13:26:35 UTC | #144

Ben, big thanks for this high quality analysis. Regarding "Eisner v. Macomber* , 252 U.S. 189 (1920)", interesting, but probably that won't apply because it's a pro rata distribution of new stock, which means everyone's financial position stays the same (vs voting rewards, which are received only by those staking in governance).

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2022-03-01 13:56:49 UTC | #145

The article you have referenced is correct in the sense that it is not yet fully clear that the IRS have abandoned plans to tax staking rewards as income when they are received, rather than when they are sold. FWIW, I had expected the IRS to push ahead with trying to tax staking rewards as income on receipt, despite the contrary case law. This was one of the reasons why maturity works as it does, although I think the design could have been made stronger, hence this proposal. The signs are good that they may back off, but I agree, perhaps we shouldn't celebrate too soon. I will update the post with a link to that post you shared.  

Whatever the IRS does, it remains the case that the taxation of staking rewards around the world is completely new territory, and it's not clear how the penny will fall. There will be very few deterministic answers. How the penny falls will depend on many things that are hard to predict, including sentiment for/against crypto in government, the outcome of court cases, and many other things. However, it is also true that most democracies have fairly rigid legal systems, and the decision will not fall to bureaucrats entirely - unless new legislation is passed, every decision they make is open to challenge on the basis of contradictory, accepted case law. That is why in my analysis and proposal I look at pre-existing accepted case law. 

I would caution against the idea of slavishly following the advice from anyone who gives themselves the title "professor", "assistant professor" (as per Emin Gün Sirer, but he often forgets the first bit, lol). There is broad disagreement between professors on subjects, demonstrating that they cannot be oracles of truth,  and I can tell you having spent a lot of time looking at applied crypto and distributed computing proposals over the years that most of them are not up to much. I would also caution you against blindly following the advice of lawyers. Since 2013 I have been in contact with many leading law firms providing advice to those operating in crypto, and listened to them at conferences, and so on. What I can tell you in review, is that the vast majority of advice that these leading lawyers provided was clearly wrong, as I suspected at the time, and many crypto entrepreneurs listening too carefully to what they said were placed at an enormous advantage. Most people in domains outside crypto do not fully understand the nuances.

Ergo.. there is no substitute for doing your own research and brain power. Paying experts is often how you end up in deep water. As people working on the design of the Internet Computer, which work we try to push onto the network via proposals, we must never abrogate our responsibilities to individuals with one or another job titles, or outside agencies. Fwiw though, we do have substantial constant contact with tax advisors, tax lawyers and stakers dealing with tax challenges in different jurisdictions. We might be wrong, because there is no deterministic answer, but we are not making these proposals in an uninformed way.

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2022-03-01 13:59:35 UTC | #146

Note, however, that it *would* be pro rata if everyone staked for the same amount and voted on the same number of proposals. Some people (by their own choice) decide not to do that, though. By failing to stake and vote, their share just goes to those who do vote. Does that matter? I don't know, but it certainly makes the argument colorable. 

The concept underlying *Eisner* also raises a separate point. *Eisner* recognizes that when additional stock in a company is created and given to shareholders, it dilutes the value of existing shares because the only thing that has changed is the number of shares in existence. The same should be true here because ICP represents the right to vote on proposals in the NNS. Have I "clearly realized" an "undeniable ascension to wealth" if I stake ICP in a dissolving 1 year neuron and make just under 6% in rewards when the voting power of my existing ICP has gone down about 9% due to voting rewards inflation? 

To be clear, I don't know whether a court would agree with my argument that *Eisner* applies. But I personally think it's fairly convincing.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2022-03-01 14:08:57 UTC | #147

Every tax jurisdiction will make its own decision regarding the taxation of staking rewards, and maturity. However, around the world, the taxation of income, and capital gains, mostly follows common principles. We do not believe that staking rewards should be taxed as income when they are received, only when they are sold, for the reasons given, but also believe that many tax authorities will try to tax them as income on receipt. For that reason, the design ensures that maturity is not fully realized wealth over which the neuron owner has full dominion. The design was sympathetic to the shape of global tax regulation, with the aim of protecting neuron holders. 

However, there can be no guarantees. For this reason, we are proposing further hardening to increase the likelihood that a) increases in neuron maturity are NOT treated as ordinary income that is immediately taxable, b) neuron owners can stake their maturity, rather than merging it, which currently causes new ICP to be produced, which has a higher likelihood of being seen as income, c) neuron owners can choose whether to export stake vs use maturity to produce ICP, which provides them with some additional tax planning power over when they wish to pay capital gains vs income tax.

Final point: we think the design will actually be simpler to use in many ways, despite the complexity of its rationale. For example, ICP will now be directly disbursed rather than exported in a newly spawned neuron, etc.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2022-03-01 14:11:28 UTC | #148

I want to reiterate: tax planning is not tax avoidance. Governments and tax authorities encourage people to carefully plan for how their business systems play with the frameworks provided, so that they can succeed. We are applying the same approach here with a decentralized protocol.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2022-03-01 14:17:13 UTC | #149

Agreed on many of your points. I agree that tokens on the ICP ledger should not be messed with under anything other than the most extreme existential circumstances. That's why there are implemented on their own traditional "immutable blockchain" (which is hosted on the Internet Computer blockchain, a kind of blockchain within a blockchain..)

Maturity is a different thing though in my view. It is an attribute of a neuron, within a self-updating governance system. Just like the Internet Computer blockchain must evolve, so must the Network Nervous System itself. That's not to say we should start randomly removing maturity, but it's not the same as ICP on the ledger. 

Note that this mutability of maturity is one of the key reasons the maturity is not income, and this point is also very, very important to a lot of people. This proposal, by changing how maturity is treated, provides a demonstration of this point. FTR I have a lot of maturity, and very much care about it. This isn't about taking people's maturity away.

dominicwilliams | 2022-03-01 14:25:44 UTC | #150

Thanks for your thoughts. Taxation is not the only reason for this proposal, but it is an important part of it. 

Worth noting that taxation has implications regarding how democratic the system is. For example, I know of many people living in crypto friendly/low tax jurisdictions like Puerto Rico, Portugal and Monaco who have been compounding away by merging their maturity without a care in the world (and thus creating new ICP on the ledger, which has a higher chance of being seen as income around the world). Meanwhile, I also know of people, myself included, who have not merged their maturity because they were scared it would create an income tax liability that would force additional sales. 

As much as anything, this is an effort to put more people around the world on a level footing with those in crypto friendly/low tax jurisdictions. The key to the proposed changes here, is that we will allow people to stake maturity rather then merging it

Hey Dominic, thank you for taking time to take part to the conversation. Could you please answer to this (below) ?

This is great that you say there is a possibility the plan may not work as intended and at the end, there is a possibility that all the maturity may be taxable.
My point is that IRS don't care about the wording or the form.  You can name it dividends, rewards, interest.  IRS are taxing all income.  If a company are sending you a car because you have invested in it, the value of the car is an income and is taxable.  This is my point.  Everything can be an income.
If IRS ever accept that IC may pay maturity to investors without any taxes and these investors can accumulate wealth over decades with no taxes, IC would be the only one entities that can do this.  All investors will want be in IC and the price of ICP would have no limit. I would love it.
All companies would change their dividends system for a Maturity system.  So easy to do if this can avoid taxes.
I don't care for myself.  I am on the safe side.  I don't care for the handful of people on this thread because  they have all information to make their own decision. But I care for small investors, not here,  who have a blind confidence in you and have some chances ( many TMO) to have to pay huge tax bills later on and cannot afford to take that chance.  What will be their solution if they are accumulating that income for years,  have everything lock for 8 years, and the maturity become an official taxable income.
Now, IRS say all form of crypto rewards are taxable until proven otherwise.  I act accordingly and will change (and claim back) if they ever loose their stance.  This is not what people want to hear or read but is a much, much safer approach. 
I knew from the beginning this proposal was proposed due to those 26 millions ICP not minted yet to avoid tax, and those ICP (still in maturity form) would want the voring and the rewards.  It should have been stated clearly from the beginning though.
I truly hope the maturity tricks would work but, due to my age (at least a decade more then you Dominic) and experience with international business (in 22 countries with US as part at 95%), it is too much of a dream for me.

EDIT:  Dominic, you have a huge influence on many people.  Please be careful with that influence. This is a huge social responsibility.

OVVOVVO | 2022-03-02 00:44:44 UTC | #154

The proposals do not limit anyone from playing it safe and deciding for themselves that their maturity = taxable event.

Let's let the proposals be enacted, vote on them one by one, allow people to exercise their freedom of choice, use them or not use them, see how it works in the end and go from there. No monetary cost to make the changes either.

[/quote]

Since maturity is compounded in a separate silo in the new plan, it can be disbursed as soon as the IRS comes to such a conclusion. If that happens a few years down the line, after a bunch of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ending with a verdict in favour of the IRS, it could be a bloodbath, since all the compounded maturity from American investors will come to market at the same time. The possibility of this happening will overhang ICP price until the conclusion is reached.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-02 04:05:18 UTC | #156

I must have missed something then.
Do you mean the Stake maturity will be rewarded without any lock period?  Same as an 8 years lock neurons now, but with no lockup and available at any time?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-02 05:56:21 UTC | #157

Staked maturity would share the same lockup period as the neuron itself. This is what permits it to count toward voting power and thus compound future rewards.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-03-02 06:18:20 UTC | #158

If that is the case, then what happens in the event that the IRS wins a judgement years down the line that all staked maturity is taxable and slaps people with a huge retrospective bill that they cannot pay by selling ICP because it is locked in?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-02 06:22:48 UTC | #159

If that were to happen, you'd be in the same situation as anyone else who receives a huge asset without cash on hand to pay the tax obligation. This is why you have to use your own best judgment in addition to whatever you can learn from available experts: because there are real risks involved in getting it wrong for your locality.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-03-02 06:52:16 UTC | #160

But isn't that exactly what happened with seed investors? They used their best judgement knowing there were risks involved. Why are we making an exception for them?

-------------------------

Hashimoto | 2022-03-02 11:54:43 UTC | #161

To my mind there is an inconsistency between the goals of compounding and delaying the receipt of funds as a taxable event. My position (and I confirmed it with a tax advisory firm for the UK) is:

* Increases in Maturity are not taxable. (It is an internal accounting variable. No ICP has been received and no benefit obtained.)
* When a neurone is spawned or maturity is staked. This is receipt of a benefit and is taxable.

This argument seems defendable in substance. Though I would prefer if the word "*maturity*" were replaced by a more neutral term such as "*accumulated voting activity*" without financial connotations. 
  
I worry that the proposal actually makes the situation murkier and creates its own risk

* It tries to create a clever argument whereby re-invested (something) is not taxable because it is uncertain. I don't see authorities buying this argument as it is clearly analogous to dividend reinvestment.
* It encourages re-investment and therefore makes the voting centralisation worse.

More straight forward ways to reduce tax liability related selling pressure and accumulated rewards would be to;

1. Provide an easy way for people to automatically convert a proportion of their rewards to ICP or even cycles to cover tax rather than the whole amount.
2. Reduce voting rewards so that total inflation is lowered. (Voting rewards are paid for via inflation and reduced capital gains in any case so are somewhat zero sum despite being taxable. I would therefore argue they should be the minimum required to incentivise participation and locking and any amount in excess of this is actually damaging.)
3. Only pay rewards periodically. For example on a quarterly basis. This would reduce continuous selling pressure, Simplify tax accounting. And because the market would anticipate an increase in supply on these dates it is likely that the ICP price and therefore taxable gains would be lower on these dates.

In my experience this is how RSUs work. They’re seen as income, so the platform facilitating the receipt of them performs a “sell to cover” transaction to pay for the taxes.

I’m not suggesting that the NNS would actually make a sale, but rather set aside the portion relating to tax as you suggested.

The problem with that approach is the dissolve delay. In 7 days that portion of ICP could be worth less than the tax liability.

That’s also a problem today but because it’s an “all or nothing” approach there would most likely enough to at least cover the tax.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-03-02 22:37:27 UTC | #163

in PR this is seen as ordinary income taxed at regular rates (not low thats for sure) unless they have a special tax decree which they have been approved for the tax exemption to cover staking revenues; it's not easy and cheap.  otoh practically anyone can set up a company in estonia where retained earnings aren't taxed for about 500 euros.

but fine whatever do as you wish, whales will just manipulate the price up 5% for a month and then do a disbursal to get an extra 5% so that you can go around telling people they *might* not have to pay tax.  

btw  Dominic love how you slyly poop on the big accounting firms to avoid them doing any work and thus avoiding any chance of them pooing all over on this proposal

I never understood the reason for the 7 days delay either. It smells like a failed tax optimisation strategy too.

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-03-02 22:52:54 UTC | #166

this is why i think this proposal based on hopium is dangerous.  rather than spending time setting up some corporate structure that allows them to stake coins and pay lower tax, they will place their hope on some little trick worked up by the engineers over at Dfinity foundation.  now it may well be that a pending case in US federal court will make all this moot in a few years anyway and staking rewards will only be taxed on sale, in which case making this change won't matter; or it may be that the courts decide that staking rewards are taxed when received and then some unfortunate soul is going to have to go through years of federal court and appeals to see if Dominic is right.  Or Dfinity along with other staking type coins could focus on lobbying politicians to explicitly safeguard staking rewards... but that's asking too much of the crypto bros in this industry to engage with the political class they'd rather just try to code around that social interaction challenge

-------------------------

superduper | 2022-03-02 23:04:56 UTC | #167

coins are not supposed to be shares but you bring out another interesting point about voting.
 
the rewards (or whatever you want to call them) are linked to work (voting) that's being done on modifications to the system.  the renumeration for this accrues during which time the work is done if accounting is done on an accrual basis, if it's cash basis the revenue would be recognized when payment is received.  if the neurons are owned by a corporation that uses accrual basis in their accounting they would most likely need to accrue the revenue as the work (votes) is being done.  

I would bet that most of the largest holders have their neurons transferred to some corporate entity. so this whole exercise is moot for them, except that they could gain an additional 5% by timing their disbursals correctly.

only individuals or smaller business operate on a cash basis accounting and so I wonder how much impact this would even have given that dfinity already has so many whales.

-------------------------

Nick | 2022-03-03 01:17:36 UTC | #168

IMO this proposal to adjust the maturity system is very sensible. I think it will actually make managing rewards *far simpler*, since it creates a much clearer line between "income-like events" (receiving newly-minted ICP), versus non-taxable events (withdrawing your *old* ICP from a neuron). And replacing the whole "spawn neuron" thing with a direct receipt of ICP makes everything so much simpler.

This proposal is very well-thought-out. If/when it is submitted to the NNS, I will be voting "yes"!

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-03 18:53:28 UTC | #169

Not sure if it has been mentioned but an option to merge maturity into a separate neuron would also be nice, spawing a 7 day neuron everytime is tedious.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-03-04 02:08:06 UTC | #170

I started out against the proposal but I am considering to vote for it.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-04 19:35:03 UTC | #171

As it currently stands I'm against this proposal, it adds another layer of complexity to an already complex staking system HOPING it might help stakers in some countries avoid taxation for an undefinied period of time, as there is a lot of uncertainty around crypto taxation and lots will change in the upcoming years.

The modulation on newly minted ICP makes it harder for a staker to predict actual APR and harder for analysts to make prediction on inflation and other metrics, the current 5% seems like an arbitrary number, if the point of it is to add uncertanty to the final number of token you'll mint, wouldn't 1% also do the job? Truth is nobody knows cause this whole proposal could be useless to avoid taxation and then we would be left with a ruse goldberg maturity mechanism that serves no actual purpose.

I agree with some changes: change 3 is quite useful and should be implemented regardless of what happens with this proposal, it should also be possible to merge maturity directly to a separate neuron, without disbursing it into a 7 day dissolving neuron and then adding the minted tokens to the neuron's stake.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-03-05 00:13:40 UTC | #172

Ignoring the taxation arguments, a good portion of the opposition feedback here is related to potentially overcomplicating the NNS UX and this change driving users away from staking. This is a fair criticism, as I think we all can agree in some capacity that the current NNS app UI/UX is in need of some TLC

Instead of arguing about a one-pager that's hard for some of us to parse together, why don't the proponents of this proposal put together a storyboard or build a simple UI/UX that anyone interested (this forum or otherwise) can use to step through the new workflow and put this conjecture to the test. This way, any concerns about the user before any proposal is voted on with respect to the usage of further DFINITY engineering resources.

@dominicwilliams @jwiegley  Would like to see a demo of the NNS of what this UX would look like before voting on any engineering power dedicated to the beefier backend changes/parts of this proposal. This could be a video, or even better a static UI (no backend, but realistic interactions) that could familiarize us with how the changes would impact NNS users and also provide the necessary user-testing to refine and catch potential issues in the proposal design with respect to how they are driven from the NNS app.

If others agree, this might be better as a separate proposal (unrelated to the current one) to separate concerns about the deliverables being worked on.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-05 15:31:15 UTC | #173

BTW usually when I'm describing the complexity arising from this proposal it's not just the user interface, I'm talking mostly about the complexity of the system itself. Increased complexity of the system itself may make it harder to explain to others, harder to comprehend, harder to program, harder to test, harder to analyze, harder to make predictions on, and of course harder to make a simple UI.

-------------------------

Nick | 2022-03-05 23:59:26 UTC | #174

This proposal isn't really that complicated. There are only two quantities at play: ICP and maturity, both of which can be **staked** or **not staked**. The interplay between these quantities can probably be explained by a single **conversion diagram**, and I'd recommend Dfinity add such a diagram to the NNS interface, alongside the buttons to perform conversion. In fact, I'd recommend that a diagram be designed (with the help of a proper graphic designer) and posted here before the formal proposal is made.

I'm confident this can be clearly explained.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-06 00:58:59 UTC | #175

On its own it is not that complicated but the existing staking system already takes some time to wrap your head around, so adding another layer on top of it that isn't even guaranteed to fulfill its intended purpose is not a wise decision in my opinion.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-06 18:02:46 UTC | #176

-------------------------

ildefons | 2022-03-07 03:21:18 UTC | #177

The question is not whether the people reading the forum understand the proposal. The question is whether an average retail investor considering ICP to diversify her portfolio will find acceptable to spend time understanding this proposal and the many future updates to come short and mid-term.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-07 23:15:46 UTC | #178

I mean, most retail investors already don't invest in ICP because they don't understand it. Nothing we do will convince them to invest the days and weeks it takes to get a basic understanding of ICP.

I don't think we should let that stop us from making the system better.

-------------------------

OVVOVVO | 2022-03-07 23:28:11 UTC | #179

I agree. The superior technology of the IC, and its increased application, will drive investment. 

If anything, the various options available once the proposal passes, to those who choose to stake their tokens, is a marketable selling point by Dfinity and not a sales liability.

-------------------------

doo | 2022-03-08 11:20:35 UTC | #180

The current level of complexity has turned investment into a daily routine: When you optimize the system to be more complex, are you sure he won't become a market rival? When the community gets better and everyone focuses on the ICP and the community asks the investors to focus on the ICP, the goals may be the same, but different processes may produce different emotions and result in very different outcomes.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-08 21:37:57 UTC | #181

The proposal as stated at the beginning of this thread is now live for voting: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-09 14:29:23 UTC | #182

My stance against this proposal is the same, I have voted against.

But if it does pass, it would make it a lot more palatable if I could keep my current maturity/staking flow. Adding these extra features as optional would be very nice.

There is some confusion...are the extra features optional? Will we be able to keep the current staking and maturity rules if we choose to?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-03-09 17:23:51 UTC | #183

The current rules will be lightly different : you won't be able to convert *directly* your maturity in staked ICP in the neuron whose it is the maturity, as you currently do ; you will have to *spawn* the maturity and this will convert your maturity into ICP directly to your wallet, but AFTER a delay of 7 days ("directly" meaning : not passing through a spawned neuron with a 7 days dissolve delay, so you keep the delay, but not as a dissolve delay of a neuron, because there is no more any neuron within this whole operation).

This won't be facultative.

This is why I consider, since the beginning, as necessary to add these two features :

[quote="jwiegley, post:3, topic:11011"]
* *not in this proposal (was `merge_maturity` )* : maturity → staked ICP
* *not in this proposal* : staked maturity → staked ICP
[/quote]

By doing this, one would allow you and everybody wanting to keep their current way of maturity/staking flow : it means without having to wait 7 days on one hand, and without having to surrender to choose between staked ICP or staked maturity. We should be able to use the *staked ICP* feature, to benefit of its automaticity, but to also convert this *staked maturity* into *staked ICP* eventually.

This proposal allow to replace *Staked ICP* by *Staked Maturity* thanks to the brand new *Exchange Maturity* feature, but many of us will want to eventually have only staked ICP rather than staked maturity. I DMed @jwiegley at 8 a.m UTC, so hopefully, he will answer when it will be available ! If *Exchange Maturity* is implemented, we have also to allow to people to do the contrary, by *Exchanging ICP* : convert staked maturity into staked ICP.

IMO, we should allow people satisfied with the current system to also keep it as an option among the new ones, and we should allow them to benefit of the automatic compounding thanks to the staked maturity AND convert it into staked ICP eventually. In its current state, it makes people chose between staked maturity OR staked ICP. There is a passage from the latter to the former, but not from the former to the latter, and it is problematic.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-09 18:57:39 UTC | #184

Your current workflow should mostly remain, just become a little bit easier, since there won't be a spawned neuron to deal with. In other words, you still either "stake" maturity so that it contributes to voting power and thus future returns, or you "disburse" maturity in order to convert it to ICP you receive after seven days.

The tangible differences for such a workflow with this proposal are:

- Staking maturity no longer mints ICP until the dissolve delay is zero and you disburse;
- Disbursing maturity will factor in the modulation after the seven day delay.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-09 19:27:48 UTC | #185

@jwiegley is it safe to assume that topping up a neuron will work the same way it does today? The newly staked ICP would be added to the Staked ICP bucket and voting power would increase accordingly?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-09 19:29:47 UTC | #186

Yes, topping up a neuron with ICP will increase the staked ICP of that neuron.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-09 19:41:19 UTC | #187

I know its not part of the proposal but you should consider adding the possibility to merge maturity in another neuron with the initial release, with the current workflow one would have to spawn a neuron, then dissolve it and add the ICP to the neuron stake, which is tedious to do. With the new workflow it will be more problematic due to price modulation.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-09 19:50:00 UTC | #188

Actually, with the current governance there is already an easier path:

- Spawn the maturity into a reward neuron.
- Merge the reward neuron immediately into a target neuron.

-------------------------

Ori | 2022-03-09 20:23:09 UTC | #189

^^ Apologies @Zane there is a shorter path now using the new Merge neuron command (I’d answered otherwise in another thread).

This command hasn’t quite made it into the nns app UI just yet though, it’s on its way: [https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/539 ](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/539)

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2022-03-09 21:51:45 UTC | #190

I hope that whatever the outcome of the vote is the people who proposed this realize that if they see such a pushback from a proposal they should at least try to understand the concerns against it and adopt/modify it to satisfy the majority of the community.

![2022-03-09_22-47|690x212](upload://hLqHjmOZYTs7zkVuNZxMFOSBXsL.png)

At the moment we seem to have a proposal that is dividing the ICP community and will enforce a major and unwanted change in the way the system works to ~half of the voters.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-10 00:27:53 UTC | #191

And it seems like DFINITY/ICA will probably come in and create a much more drastic win, since they just recently started voting on proposals.

Based on recent activity they seem to have around 25% voting power.

-------------------------

criptosoft | 2022-03-10 00:44:13 UTC | #193

1. Generally technology and innovations are ahead of the law. First you invent the car and then you create traffic laws. It seems to me that this whole issue is nothing more than the clarification against the RSI of at what point a tax should really be recorded (in a generic way that works for any country), since the tokenomic models, apart from being new, can be Unlike traditional models, it is necessary to clarify at what point the rewards are actually available to be recorded. That will help investors to pay taxes at the end when the reward is actually available, and not before.
2. The other point is more like a Taxtobin, +5%, -5% depending on the trend.
If the proposals were separate, I would vote "yes" on the first and "no" on the second.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-10 01:06:23 UTC | #194

I agree Dfinity will likely be the deciding factor (if they choose to vote). I do hope they vote. I think it’s important to go on record with these things.

Do we know how Dfinity or the ICA’s vote gets decided? Is it an executive only decision?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-10 01:19:51 UTC | #195

My understanding is that DFINITY doesn't vote on governance proposals. At least I don't think they have yet, as of a few months ago..

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-10 01:28:52 UTC | #196

They recently started voting on them again. Diego said they would be posting something about their plans soon

I agree. I think it makes sense

-------------------------

criptosoft | 2022-03-10 13:21:19 UTC | #200

3. I reflected a little more on point 2, the taxtobin models, they did not work very well because they were applied to the pure speculation of a currency, in this case we are talking about increasing and cutting monetary mass by +,- 5% on the market trend, it could work. It should also be noted that ICP use cases should be increased where it implies a token burn.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-10 17:18:29 UTC | #201

Good to know, but still if this proposal passes we'd need a way to merge maturity between 2 neurons, cause spawning a neuron means being subject to the price modulation, which could be annoying for those who compound on a daily basis.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-03-10 20:20:17 UTC | #202

Very balanced view. On the part of having 5 different proposals, I would say that any proposal is good, even ill intentioned ones, many of which we may be seeing in future from community members. It is up to the voters to decipher and adopt or reject.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-10 23:27:46 UTC | #203

I've requested that we add an implementation item for transferring non-staked maturity between neurons.

coteclaude | 2022-03-11 01:28:52 UTC | #204

FYI, To US tax payer:
**the 2021 version** of [IRS Form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf) now asks recipients if, at any point throughout the year, they have received, sold, exchanged or disposed of another financial interest through virtual currency. Users must then check the “Yes” or “No” box in response. The IRS further proves their crackdown by placing this question on the form, directly below a taxpayer’s name and address, a location that can’t be missed. The language has also been clarified to specify that only taxable events, including receiving cryptocurrency as payment, airdrops, exchanging different cryptocurrencies, selling assets, earning from [mining](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-mining-won-t-survive-another-round-of-environmental-legislation) **and staking**, **would be classified as a “yes” on the updated form.**

By omitting to define all possible staking reward forms, they include all staking reward.  Can be a token, a car, a chair, maturity, everything.

Please be careful before locking everything for 8 years.  You will need much money to pay back to IRS, with compounded penalties and interest.  When this start to happen, in few years, I can only imagine the disaster for ICP.
The debate is over, the proposal will obviously pass because of so many US investors thinking they will trick the IRS.  This is not FUD.  This is only reality.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-11 21:51:54 UTC | #206

Hi Befi, this question is out of scope for the current thread, since we are only discussing the compounding maturity proposal here. But the short answer is that you cannot merge neurons created with the NNS Dapp into Ledger hardware wallet neurons.

I think the omission of maturity -> staked ICP and staked maturity -> staked ICP really make this proposal a lot less attractive to me. I really like the goal of "How to compound maturity with the least manual effort", but suppose I want to
- compound maturity
- avoid one big +/- 5% gamble, instead i want to spread my risk

Then it looks to me like this proposal does not actually simplify that workflow. It looks like the proposal in its current form will pass, but I hope we will still consider adding those extra paths. Turning on "auto-compounding" and once in a while clicking the button converting staked maturity into staked ICP (to take the +/- 5% events regularly for smaller amounts) would be a very cool option, and much more convenient than spawning / dissolving / disbursing / topping up regularly.
