As DFINITY/ICA will probably be deciding the vote, I urge them and @dominicwilliams to look at the large amount of opposition to this proposal and to please reconsider.

![Screenshot from 2022-03-11 11-04-38|690x183](upload://xVRaECQXZRpVHnPQs1UyHBC1WmP.png)

Also consider that cycledao.xyz, ICP Maximalist Network, and ICDevs have voted no.

+1 on this. I think that with some changes and incorporating feedback this proposal can be remade and pass with a big majority. There is a few good ideas in it.

Let's get back to the drawing table

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-12 00:44:46 UTC | #210

It will passed by big majority at the end.  @dominicwilliams and Dfinity will jump in the vote at the end if they need to make it pass.
If it was on a per neuron or individual vote, it would never pass.  
This is the most obvious case where this kind of democracy is a total fail.
**When voting for a political party or president, you don't have more voting power because you are more rich.**
Does people start to see the huge flaw with this voting system?
EDIT: I have to admit this topic had made me realize how bad a voting system based on wealth is not democracy at all.

If you want to compare the NNS voting system to a traditional system, it’s nothing like the one-person-one-vote system that’s common in democratic governments. What it’s more akin to is stockholder voting in a corporation, where the number of votes a shareholder has corresponds to the number of shares they own (like NNS voting power corresponds to staked ICP), and it’s common for shareholders to vote by proxy, assigning their voting rights another party (like NNS following).

Hey. @coteclaude ..I personally am starting to feel your comments on this topic to be a little bit of a nuisance.
First you started by saying that it was breaking the law, that it was TAX evasion attempt when in fact it was none of it.
Now you are saying that is Wealth base democracy. 
Well...I think that the only way to have a real democratic voting system, the way you are insinuating is to have every neuron owner properly identified and not privacy. My question is ..are you willing to give up your anonymity for the sake of a better voting system.
I am not 100% in favor of this proposal...but your comments are rather extreme.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-12 02:05:20 UTC | #214

As a workaround, you could toggle where to receive neuron rewards. For example, you can tell NNS to give you rewards as "maturity" for 1 year, and then the next year change it so that you receive rewards as "staked maturity". This toggle is part of this proposal, and can be switched at any time.

I think if you were able to convert staked maturity to anything else, wouldn't that break the whole assumption of staking? If you decide to stake maturity, then my understanding is that you shouldn't be able to take out anything from your stake until your stake duration has elapsed.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-12 02:28:37 UTC | #215

Darien
I am not extreme as I truly believe in everything I post.
You understand that the extra 27 millions of ICP still in form of maturity will have voting power with this proposal, right?  All actual neurons will see their daily rewards cut quiet a big chunk (25 to 35% cut to my opinion)
After this vote, what would prevent the whales to , only as an example, make a future proposal for removing the rights of all small neurons, let say less then 25k icp, to vote and keep all the rewards and voting for them?  I am not saying it will happen but technically, it could.  And because technically it could, this is very bad to me.
The other thing is I locked my ICP in 8 years with the conditions and process at time, where if you don't mint and combined your ICP, you don't vote and neither get rewards.  Now the conditions will change and this is not what I have signed for.  At least, give investors an opportunity to unlock our neurons and run out of this.
And finally, yes I strongly believe programming to evade tax is not legal and I don't want be associated directly or indirectly with this kind of organization.  My problem is I have no way out.

Yes, I admit I find about everything bad in this proposal.

My post can be a nuisance for you but may also be some very good thinking taught for many others as I have receive many likes in many of my posts.

There is a misunderstanding here. @Manu is not militating about the possibility of converting Staked Maturity into LIQUID icp, but the one of converting Staked Maturity into STAKED icp.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-12 07:38:56 UTC | #218

Right, but you can still withdraw staked ICP via the new `exchange_maturity` [function](http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/images/ExchangeMaturity.png), so it's still a way to "cash out" your staked maturity. In fact, it's arguably a more tax-liable way of cashing out, since `exchange_maturity` bypasses the +/-5% modulation.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-03-12 10:20:09 UTC | #219

The staked maturity is impossible to cash out, you only can exchange your initial staked ICP for staked maturity using liquid maturity. You seem to call « staked maturity » the accumulated liquid maturity, that you could exchange for liquid ICP, as we always could. Anyway, the same quantity of staked material would be maintained, at the minimum. 

So there would not be more cash out of staked item, that there is currently. But I see what you mean. 

We are just for a possibility to autocompound AND eventually exclusively have staked ICP rather than necessarily having irreductible staked maturity as soon as we would have used the auto compound function.

Plus, the day when You have 0 icp in your neuron, and only staked maturity and liquid maturity, what you see as a way of cashing out staked item would not be possible anymore.

To give a limit case, we should be able to convert a neuron empty of staked ICP and full of staked maturity into a neuron full of staked ICP and empty of staked maturity.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-12 17:07:07 UTC | #220

The way I read the proposal, exchange maturity would only convert maturity into staked maturity and release staked ICP.  Exchange maturity is not a mechanism for liquidating staked maturity.  Staked maturity is staked and can only be liquidated by dissolving and disbursing.the neuron.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-12 13:04:34 UTC | #221

I think if you exchange_maturity for staked ICP there is no price modulation because the ICP isn’t being newly minted. If you don’t have any more staked ICP then, based on my reading, you would have to disburse_maturity and be subject to the 7 day timer and modulation.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-12 18:49:56 UTC | #222

Yeah, the proposal itself does not allow neuron holders to liquidate staked maturity mid-stake. I was addressing the hypothetical situation brought up where people wanted the ability to convert staked maturity into staked ICP, which I think would essentially create a bypass mechanism where now neuron holders *can* liquidate their staked maturity mid-stake (via the `exchange_maturity` function).

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-12 20:26:59 UTC | #223

This proposal does _not_ allow the liquidation of "staked maturity". Once maturity is staked, it remains staked until the neuron is dissolved and disbursed. exchange_maturity has no impact on this.

What @Manu is referring to is that if you enable compounding maturity, you will start to accumulate staked maturity. Since that kind of maturity can only be converted into ICP at exactly one time (disbursal), you are taking the risk of a -5% discount on the entire amount.

If, on the other hand, there were a way to convert staked maturity into staked ICP -- with the required modulation -- then I could do so weekly or monthly and average out the discount.

Nothing in what I've said above allows the extraction or receipt of maturity in the form of ICP any earlier than what is currently possible. It's just a difference as to whether you hold the extra voting power earned through maturity as "staked maturity" or as "staked ICP". The two are equivalent from the perspective of governance, but not equivalent in terms of market risk due to the modulation factor in the proposal.

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2022-03-13 09:22:48 UTC | #225

If this proposal passes how fast will the changes be implemented? Will we have the option to not use them (look at the amount of NO votes) and keep the normal way?

Also will there be a very detailed guide and UI for people who end up using what you want to change here? It's really complicated and hard to understand from a user/investor point of view.

-------------------------

Zan | 2022-03-13 14:00:33 UTC | #226

may i know if there any change for the community fund banner within the new staked maturity?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-13 16:54:50 UTC | #227

I would expect the changes to be implemented fairly quickly, but there would not be the option to "do things the old way", because it would harm the tax argument if you had the option to avoid modulation. Is that what you meant by the "old way"?

The new UI that incorporates these features is quite nice, actually, and the lack of a separate reward neuron simplifies things considerably. No matter whether this proposal passes or not, I do hope another proposal will offer that functionality.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-03-13 17:24:47 UTC | #228

Come on, you know it's going to pass, there's no 'whether this proposal passes or not'. I've been tracking the way these votes go; the whales keep the count close to maintain a charade of decentralisation, but they have plenty of voting power held in reserve. We saw how it played out in the ICDevs case. There is clearly a cartel of whales who coordinate voting in these matters.
As I have said before, whales are not an issue in themselves, every blockchain has them. The problem with Dfinty is that they designed the tokenomics so that the same whales will be doing the same stuff eight years down the line.
I've asked a number of questions on this thread which you yourself said were worth answering. But they remain unanswered. Nevertheless, like black holes are bordered by bright event horizons, Dfinity's very silence and opacity sends out a clearly visible message.
After the way recent votes have played out, I have decided not to increase my stake in the token as planned, even though the current price is very tempting. No matter how pathbreaking the tech may be, there are non-tech issues that make me not want to put too many eggs in the IC basket.

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2022-03-13 17:40:05 UTC | #229

The tax argument is ridiculous and one of my main oppositions to this proposal.

The lack of a separate reward neuron is indeed nice and would love to see it.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-03-13 18:49:14 UTC | #231

There definitely is, most of the supply is held by VC who spent a lot of money on ICP at prices retail buyers never seen, the same whales are now staking those absurd amount of tokens for 8 years and increasing their voting power thanks to maturity and age bonus and if (when?) this proposal passes they'll stack even more cause maturity won't be taxed. I think the recent governance proposals showed quite clearly we need people parties and some form of quadratic voting asap, otherwise the NNS will just be a farce where a few holders and Dfinity are the ones who actually decide.

How is that different than any other staking system?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-14 00:58:44 UTC | #233

the major difference is they don't change the rule while investors are locked in.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-03-14 03:44:26 UTC | #234

Borovan, in the ICDevs vote discussion, (where I was on the same side as the whales) a spokesperson for large stakeholders literally wrote on this forum in the first person plural, speaking on behalf of a bunch of whales. And the posts were clearly from someone deeply knowledgable, a long-time insider.
JaMarco, about how Dfinity's staking system is different, I have explained it before, but here goes once more. At genesis a number of blockchains have been dominated by a few large holders. But these holders have been incentivized to sell when prices are high. There is no 8 year lock-in with huge rewards on offer in any other system. As a result, no entrenched oligopoly has persisted in a major L1 token. 
I understand that it is difficult to distinguish supporters of a system who are criticising particular aspects of it from those who, as Borovan says, are concern trolling with an intent to destabilize.  I have tried to keep my posts substantive, but recognise that they did grow angry at times. I was frustrated with the way Dfinity approached the Mario issue and now this one. Anyway, I have now reached a definitive conclusion, which is not to put too much more energy or resources into ICP. I will hold on to the stake I already have, and shift to being a passive observer from here on in.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-03-14 07:48:40 UTC | #235

Oh yeah, *that* cartel of whales.  I remember now!

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-14 08:22:12 UTC | #236

Legitimate question here...
This proposal will pass.  This means the majority of voting power believe maturity is not taxable.  And the new system will not increase the ICP supply. I respect that.
In that case, why don't we increase the rewards to 25 or 30% of actual supply instead of the 10 to 5% over 8 years as we have now? 
99% of the rewards will be only maturity wich seems to be a non tangible asset.
99% of investors will not (most probably never) claim the maturity to avoid paying tax
This maturity will not increase the ICP supply

I am asking... what would be the downside of this?

@dominicwilliams @jwiegley  Curious to have your opinion on this.

I have been going off the 21% 8 year neuron factor from the governance tab, i know it will drop over the years but how do you factor that in with the circulation numbers and are you saying this proposal has chopped our rewards down even more?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-14 11:46:56 UTC | #240

1- As per the link, the total rewards will decrease over the next 7 years to reach 5% of the supply.  We are at about 9% now.  That was planned.

2- With this proposal:  There are more then 28 millions ICP still inform of maturity that were not mint, thus not staked and not rewarded.  With this proposal, those maturity will now be part of the shared rewards.  So, soon as implemented, those maturity holders will certainly stake their maturity and expect an important drop of your rewards.  I, personally, expect a 25 to 35 % decrease.  I may be off though.  We will see but an important drop will happen for sure.
No surprise if your 21% is dropping to 15% or so.

-------------------------

criptosoft | 2022-03-14 11:52:21 UTC | #242

his is not political democracy. This is financial democracy, where those who have more economic interests within the system have more voting power than those who only have a few cents. Because if you have more to lose you should have more voting power.

-------------------------

Based | 2022-03-14 11:55:24 UTC | #243

That circulation chart is buggy as hell for me, i feel lost trying to balance these two tabs so right now we are at 9% according to the chart how does that then equal 21% for 8 year neurons

Oooofff 15% another massive blow down from 28% if true

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-14 12:01:28 UTC | #244

You are at 21% for many reasons.  Not all ICP are staked and those staked ICP are not all in 8 years.  So the 8 years have more share rewards.  This explain why you have 21% while the rewards supply is 9%.
The downgrade from 21% to 15 % is only my assumption and I hope to be wrong.  It will depend how many of these 28 millions ICP in maturity holders will decide to stake.  But it is obvious to me that this proposal was to include them in the reward pie, without having to mint the maturity.  So this is why I expect them to stake their maturity and we should see quiet a drop.  The near future will let us know for sure.

-------------------------

Based | 2022-03-14 12:10:43 UTC | #245

Ah cool gotcha well needless to say a lot of people will be for your rewards boosting idea should we have another massive drop down

What would be the reason to increase the incentive? Since that maturity *could* be converted to ICP -- it's not foreknown that everyone would re-stake it -- such an increase in rewards could dramatically increase ICP inflation.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-14 23:28:51 UTC | #247

The downside to increasing the total voting reward supply is that ICP will eventually be minted.  I don’t think we need to change the voting reward supply.  I only want to see proposals that can incentivize people to reduce the sell pressure of ICP into the open market and that can reduce the uncertainty of so much undispersed maturity.  I don’t mind tokenomics changes that incentivize increases in governance participation by changing how voting rewards are divided up, but I’m generally opposed to ideas that inflate ICP supply.

# Bill From 'Bitcoin Senator' Lummis Would Alter Capital Gains Landscape for Crypto
## The Responsible Financial Innovation Act
https://decrypt.co/94834/bill-bitcoin-senator-lummis-alter-capital-gains-landscape-crypto

The bill would clarify that capital gains don't apply to "productive" activities such as mining or staking because you're not getting rid of the asset. Mining refers to using computing power to help secure a blockchain network and potentially earn crypto as a reward. Staking refers to dedicating your crypto to a network to increase security and earn passive income.

"The current gray area is that you might be accruing a capital gains taxable event under proof of stake as it stands right now, even if you're just delegating," said Lindholm.

-------------------------

Hashimoto | 2022-03-15 08:08:39 UTC | #249

Some simpler proposals for tax optimisation:

1. **Prefer capital gains to income**. Reduce the base level NNS rewards thus reducing income but increasing likelihood of capital gain as overall issuance is reduced.

2. ~~**Reward voting with "stock options" not free ICP or maturity** Do not reward NNS neurons with maturity, ICP or anything directly convertible to ICP but with options at some nominal value payable in cycles (e.g. $0.01) that can be optionally exercised after some vesting period. (No tax is paid by either the option holder when options are granted (and even vested), but when the options are exercised, the option holder will be subject to Income Tax and NICs on the difference in price between the “strike price” and the actual market value of the shares at that time)~~

(Edit won't work this only applies to employees)

3. **Remove the maturity variable,Instead just keep the voting record**. 
Some options for converting to ICP are:
(a) Neurons should be able to prune their voting record and be rewarded by the protocol with ICP for the act of pruning it. (Reward is for the act of pruning not the act of voting)
(b) Neurons should be able to request that their voting record be pruned and replaced with ICP reward and this should be subject to a vote. (Reward is subject to discretionary vote like KYC proposal or discretionary bonus or enmass dividend)

Unless it's a one-way opt-in right? It would make me feel a lot better if we allowed people to opt-in per neuron. As long as you can't opt out after the decision, why would that hurt the tax arguments?

Considering this is a major breaking change in a complex dynamic system, perhaps there's an engineering process argument for not introducing a breaking change into the system when it isn't necessary.

Let's allow others the option of making their own tax determinations instead of deciding it for everyone.

John
Will it be well indicated before you process the minting of your maturity if you will have an extra 5% or be penalize 5% for the new minted ICP?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-30 00:47:36 UTC | #254

The best that can be reported in the UI is an estimate, since there is a required 7 days of uncertainty. This period of unknown volatility will induce a range of possible values, and I'm hoping the UI will report that range, so that you know which size dice you're rolling.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-30 02:05:03 UTC | #255

Don't you think it would be much preferable to establish the exact amount at the start of the process, before the 7 days delay to eliminate uncertainty?
I can imagine an investor starting the process thinking he is in the good + 5% slot and then end up with a 5% lost after the irreversible 7 days waiting time.  
That would generate a 10% difference, wich is quiet important.
Can we make a suggestion for this?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-30 10:20:27 UTC | #256

There is a formula documented in the original post.  My interpretation is that the majority of the modulation is determined from past trends, which means that it won’t swing from one extreme to the other.  So while we won’t know the exact modulation amount, it seems we will have a decent idea.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-30 14:23:39 UTC | #257

The reason the modulation exists at all is to induce uncertainty in the amount received. If it could be known in advance, there would be no reason for it.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-03-30 22:38:01 UTC | #258

Is there a solution for people like me who believe the maturity is taxable and want to declare their rewards properly and precisely (establishing a value every day for the rewards), and report each year?
Any chance to keep the actual system too and have people decide to opt-in the new one?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-03-30 23:26:47 UTC | #259

I have asked for functionality to be added to make this opt-in, but the decision is not yet made. Since it was not part of the proposal, I can't guarantee it will happen.

[quote="jwiegley, post:3, topic:11011"]
*not in this proposal (was `merge_maturity` )* : maturity → staked ICP
[/quote]

It would be great if the existing Merge Maturity functionality (perhaps better described as "Mint and Merge Maturity") could be retained in the new system.

The conservative approach for neuron holders in the US is to treat daily maturity as a taxable event. If you want to compound your voting rewards under the new system, the built-in option is Stake Maturity, which does not mint ICP and is essentially incompatible with paying taxes on daily maturity. If you're playing it safe and paying taxes on daily maturity and you also want to compound your rewards, Merge Maturity is a much better option because:

1. Merge Maturity wouldn't be subject to the +/- 5% modulation, so you'd know exactly how much to pay taxes on.
2. The minting happens in the same year you pay taxes on the rewards (and your cost basis on those rewards is set).

To simulate Merge Maturity in the new system, the best you can do is to Disburse Maturity, wait 7 days for the +/- 5% disbursal, and then stake that ICP back into the neuron. Then you'd need to modulate the daily maturity that you're paying taxes on by the +/- 5% of the disbursal. That's doable, but it's a lot of hoops to jump through for someone who just wants to play it safe regarding taxes.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-04-02 01:34:59 UTC | #261

What if there was more than one type of neuron, and you could create a neuron that did away with the whole concept of maturity? Daily rewards are in minted ICP. Rewards ICP can be auto-merged daily, manually merged, disbursed, or just sit in the neuron as unstaked ICP. Rewards would function just like bank account interest or stock dividends.

That's probably not popular for a number of reasons, but it might align better with tax laws/guidance than either the old system or the new system, and would work for those who pay taxes on daily maturity.

I realize this proposal has already passed and the time for debate may be over, it just seems unfortunate to implement a system that doesn't include easy options for people who are just trying to follow the current tax laws/guidance.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-02 02:15:47 UTC | #262

Just so that you know, here is the request I put into the system:

> Since the modulation feature is for tax regimes where it could help the “imminent domain” argument, what about countries where it is definitely not needed for taxation purposes at all? Should those users bear the modulation risk since they don’t need that functionality?
> 
> In those cases it would useful to be able to turn modulation off at neuron creation time, such as splitting off stake into a neuron where the feature is [off.](http://off.In)
> 
> [In](http://off.In) cases where one splits off a neuron that changes the modulation flag, no maturity would be split. If the modulation flag remains unchanged, however, then both stake and maturity will be split. Whether or not the modulation flag is enabled for existing neurons should be an “opt-in” decision.

-------------------------

doo | 2022-04-03 04:56:10 UTC | #263

If we can all accurately assess the maturity of ICP generation +5% and -5%, when the ICP generation does not balance, does this ICP need to come from inflation? Or does it come from further curtailment of voting returns?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-03 09:38:31 UTC | #264

@jwiegley @dominicwilliams 

A series of proposals will be soon send to NNS in regards with this thread.  I am asking Dfinity to delay the implementation until the first vote.
**The first vote will indeed be on delaying the implementation of the new feature** 
There is too many uncertainty with the new rewards system.  As an example, still,  too (if not all) many people do not understand how the +5% or -5% works exactly.
There was no rush to proceed with the vote because those changes do not slow in any way the growth of the IC ecosystem.  In fact, the complication of the new system may even cool off investors (especially those who want to diligently pay their due taxes every year) from locking up their ICP. 
And the delay voted in this first proposal would be until the other proposals are initiated and voted.
**The second vote would be to save the actual reward system as an option** for investors locked already and want to calculate and pay their due taxes diligently, including the ICP selling requirement to do so.  Right now, investors can calculate precisely everyday the value when they merge or mint their rewards with the daily price of ICP.  If they do at noon everyday, always the same way, they obtain an accurate amount to report to their tax jurisdiction.
**A third proposal would be to let investors to unlock their neurons (if the option 2 is voted NO)** as there are important changes  that interfere with the precise calculation of taxes.  I believe Dfinity or other investors should not vote to interfere with the precise calculation of taxes, preventing investors to be crystal clear with their income tax reports.  The year 2021, because of the actual system, is great in this view.
**A fourth vote would possibly be done after a conversation here** to define the role of Dfinity as far as programming and keep them away from taxes management programming.

Of course, if Dfinity have a way to calculate precisely the rewards value everyday (with the 5% up or down) and I missed it, they are welcome to explain to investors how to calculate and pay their taxes diligently and precisely as we could do in 2021, and until now

The ultimate goal is to not interfere with investors that want pay their taxes precisely or let them out.

All comments are welcome and hopefully we can find a solution that would suit everyone.

thank you

**The second vote would be to save the actual reward system as an option** for investors locked already and want to calculate and pay their due taxes diligently, including the ICP selling requirement to do so. Right now, investors can calculate precisely everyday the value when they merge or mint their rewards with the daily price of ICP. If they do at noon everyday, always the same way, they obtain an accurate amount to report to their tax jurisdiction.

Even if I am not concerned by this tax question since I am a French, I am very sensitive to this point because lastly, a taw lawyer explained to me that, as a staker, we are member of a DAO, and that we have to be very cautious with all attempt of tax avoidance, because as member of this DAO, the IRS and every tax jurisdictions from any country will come for members of the DAO. We can't think "not my problem, Dfinity's problem if IRS or any tax jurisdiction come for someone about some reprehensible avoidance, etc, » because EACH member of the DAO will be considered as an actor of such an avoidance. So let us be very careful, and I can only advise people to keep calculating the due tax diligently. I know that @coteclaude already spoke about this earlier, but since I have friends in this ecosystem now, I have to insist : don't act like if the DAO was protecting you in case of tax hunt, because we became responsible; as staker, of any future reprehensible tax avoidance. **So, even if you don't merge once this new model adopted, KEEP calculating as if you were merging, applying the +5%, to not underestimate what you would have to pay eventually, even if you had not merged**.

This tax lawyer is a reference, specialized in crypto : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py1SnL9V5aE. If you understand French, you can listen the fifth part, titled "DAO regulations". And he says this, whereas in France, we don't even have to report to the IRS yet. So I would be more cautious if I were in a country where IRS already taxes this. I will translate it to you, or you can use an automatic translator. He explains this at 21m20. **As he says : "we can't think with the current state of things, my role is not applaud people for their current legitimacy, we have to anticipate what will happen in 3 years".**

And he really awoke me about my taxes responsibilities as a DAO member, and as he says, "if you do this, pray the North Star, and don't fool yourself, you will have to explain yourself one day, because the governments have the time, they take their time, but they will do, and they will look back what did people".

The first proposal to delay the implementation of the reward maturity changes has been initiated.  It is only asking for a delay for implementation so I believe these is no debate needed since there is no structural change, programming involved.

Another 3 proposals will be initiated with a debate in the forum

Please see the proposal and vote accordingly:  https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52949

Very good point,  my friend. We should periodically have an educational governance proposal stating that everyone should  " **KEEP calculating as if you were merging, applying the +5%, to not underestimate what you would have to pay eventually**...regardless of whether motion passes or not. At least we will be on record.

You should have made a separate thread and let the community discuss a bit before creating the proposal

superduper | 2022-04-03 20:58:33 UTC | #269

I have run this by some tax lawyers and GAAP specialists at the firm I use. I have been told the revenue accrues daily regardless of this silly 5% modulation.  I have a call later this week with them for how to treat this modulation to account for the penalty/or bonus.  

Btw another way to look at it is that 95% is certain and that there is a possible 0-10% bonus on day 7.

Would love compensation from the DAO for making me spend money on the additional tax advisory and consulting :P

Perhaps they can build a tool that keeps NNS transaction records for each account that way people can easily calculate their taxes and report as they apply to them. I wholly support the current proposal but if there is anything that can be done to address the concerns of the people against the proposal then it should absolutely be done.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-04 00:48:42 UTC | #271

The actual proposal is only to ask for a delay so we can discuss the other 3 proposals.
I did not see the value of discussing if we need a delay or not.  It is obvious that we need one if the community and Dfinity are open to listen and discuss and find solution for all of us who believe the maturity is taxable no matter what and want to pay their taxes genuinely.

Hi Forreal, this was recently discussed internally, in fact, and a feature suggestion was submitted. Just so you know that there are many of us who agree that such accounting would be of value to all stakeholders.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-06-09 22:31:06 UTC | #273

@jwiegley I'm wondering what the implementation status of this is. Is it prioritized for one of the upcoming releases, like Chromium or Carbon?

I think we need to have some pinboard where we can track the status updates of motion proposals that have been approved by the IC community. Right now, it's pretty haphazard.

Trying to understand what this is going to look like come tax time 2022. I saw the new crypto boxes, however, in 2021 1040ez it only asked if i bought or sold any crypto... then it asked me to upload my API documents from exchanges or through a spread to add into the form. I did not see anything for staking rewards. I did see mining rewards... I could be mistaken/ it could not have been on the 1040ez and is on 1040 (which I'll file this year). Personally, I am not trying to trick the IRS, I just want to know what is/ is not a taxable event so I can act according.

If maturity in general acts as a taxable event it may create FUD in US buyers within the next few months up until around 2023 tbh... because staking would be subjected to being taxed just by having it staked in the first place... unless they stake it and NEVER accrue maturity and just are holding it in there. However, if maturity *only* causes a taxable event when a person adds it into their neuron or is spawned into a new one then it could incentivize US users to use their maturity in the IC ecosystem rather than create a taxable event and merge or spawn a new neuron. Also, what is going to tell neuron holders how much they accrued this year so they can report it to the IRS? Some of us (like myself) are not in this to avoid taxation. In fact, if I make good money after my 12-year stake is up then I'll gladly pay taxes on anything I sell. What I want to find out before I spawn, merge, or add too much into my long-term neuron is "what is the IRS going to consider a taxable event". 

IMHO I agree that if this is not executed with the community's careful consideration of US buyers then it could* become future FUD because the US community is really taking off (especially with node hosts) and therefore might want to be considered by the entire community a bit more (even if they live outside these areas) because of the substantial amount of node hosts going to be receiving their rewards. Personally, I would hope to incentive these new node providers into staking but make it possible to stake and not be completely confused on how to report. Not to evade taxation but literally what gets reported and when. If it becomes a clear-cut rule on staking and what to keep track of/ report each tax season, then people (or data centers) can become accustomed to it. Right now, it's honestly not ANY blockchains fault. It's literally the IRS IMHO. The USA needs to get their shit together and start making moves in one direction or another honestly. They allow hyper elitists to get comfortable in their positions while users and developers literally scramble to keep them running and getting paid. Then once the bankrupt projects file and everyone gets into their positions for the next run, and it'll create more chaos when markets go backkkk up, and then around tax time the government can ride in on their "white horse" they'll throw their final say to the public and make bank off taxes in 2022 because they were not clear until you file and they already gotcha. THEN in 2023 everyone will know, and markets will re freaken adjust. If you can't tell I'm over this issue and want diffinitve answers lol

coteclaude | 2022-07-20 10:21:41 UTC | #276

There is no FUD of any kind in this kind of topic.  Taxes are reality and we have to cope with this no matter what.  It is up to each individual to manage as they feel.
Right now, Dfinity think that if you mint some rewards from the maturity, it is a taxable event. If they would not think so, they would not make any changes.  You can also see many neurons that don't mint their rewards and leave them as maturity.  Some people have acknowledged this was because they fear of triggering a taxable event.  As of now, if you leave your reward as maturity, you cannot compound your maturity and loose some rewards.
Now, they want make these maturity to participate to the compounding of rewards while leaving as maturity, thinking this way will not trigger any tax.

This said, maybe you should spend few hundred of $ and seek for a crypto tax accountant or specialist and find out from him (or them) if he feel receiving maturity would be taxable or not when left as maturity.

If you do, feel free to share.

According to my own accountant, all form of rewards are taxable with the value it has each day I receive it, maturity or mint tokens.  He also told me that if the IC system was to give me a car or a movie ticket as rewards, all of these were taxable at the day of reception, no matter the form
I am not saying my accountant is right.  But I feel better following his very safe advice.
 
It is a pain in the butt.  I hate it.  But I also don't want have any problems with the tax man.  So we have to choose for the least painfull option.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-07-21 02:02:27 UTC | #277

Yeah, I agree life, death, and taxes will always create FUD for sure. With that being said, I really am at a point of accepting in terms of my willingness to adhere to any 100% established rules. I appreciate the feedback on what you have found when speaking to your own accountant. I think it's solid advice. Although there are a few areas this doesn't consider. For example, if we go back to the proposal Domonic posted... He says there are parameters that would make it impossible to actually track that way. For example, if every day we are given rewards, from your accountant's standpoint every day we would experience a taxable event. However, the price of ICP is volatile and can change at any second. Therefore, it would be impossible to actually track how much you need to report each day. I do agree that we should preemptively consider our maturity as a taxable event. However, like dom said the ICP ledger actually only registers maturity as a newly minted ICP when it is spawned or merged. Therefore, the maturity if left alone would quite actually not count as a taxable event. I believe there is a HUGE communication barrier between upper-level cryptographers and average users that in some ways continues the confusion. IMO you are right (your accountant would be) absolutely, however, people keep going back to it being about shady individuals trying to bypass the IRS and other entities when it actuality it is and it is not as big of a problem currently. What the issue is that there is (as it stands today) no way to actually calculate how much your daily rewards are on a given day, only because crypto prices are, well... a moody rollercoaster on steroids. 

Now with this being said, if it becomes clear that regulators want users to hold their maturity until tax time and then we could do what we want with the rewards within that timeframe, and perhaps they could use a 30 Moving average, however, even that could be risky, cause if everyone files and it's dipped then the next month boom it really might make things... tricky... not impossible. I think the proposal Domonic submitted was actually a solid tactical fix, however, the community is much larger than US users, so with IC being a democracy, we cannot just go with the cash cow if users truly vote otherwise. SO, it really gets muddied trying to communicate to ALL communities involved the why and actual incentive behind it without making it look or appear to be favoring one country over another (completely understandable). However, the USA has the most upcoming node providers and perhaps could end up with substantial voting power within a few years. All of this could change. It could also change in 2023 when the government finally shows up and gives at least a definitive answer on wth we are supposed to do.

All in all, at the end of the day I am going to seek a local tax consultant (in my area) and I am going to be very forward, upfront, show my documents and really work with them on proving the most accurate information. To me, this is not evading taxation. If anything I would get a bit of a discount on my taxes right now lol It is me doing my due diligence with this because I am going to be involved for at least 12 years. Obviously, it is worth the time, and money spent. Even if perhaps the first five years I struggle it isn't about the destination. It's the journey. SO I will try and share what I find out this year. BUT it really will only pertain to my area, my state, and my county even. So, what works for me may not work for everyone else. That is why these headlines have all the regulators like "we need clear-cut rules here". Because you cannot (sadly) track it the way you described it (unfortunately).
