Hi all,

As the title says, Internet Identity now accepts external contributions! The [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are pretty simple: just reach out to us first to make sure the feature/bug fix makes sense and isn't being worked on already and to avoid wasting time preparing a patch that will be rejected.

See y'all on GitHub! ðŸ¤–
