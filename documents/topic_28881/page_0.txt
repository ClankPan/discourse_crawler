This release adds a few nice features, most notably, the agent works out of the box in React Native apps after switching to `@noble/curves` for bls verification!

This version will have the basic compatibility required for the new **canister logging** feature

Devs can now choose to restrict which authentication methods are allowed when logging in using Internet Identity. Pass `allowPinAuthentication: false` to `authClient.login` in order to prevent users from logging in using a PIN. You can also inspect the returned `onSuccess` payload in order to learn the `authnMethod` which can be `'passkey' | 'pin' | 'recovery'`

Fun fact - this update comes with a significant decrease to the package size of most agent-js bundles!

Thanks for the canister logging and the feature to disable PIN authentication. I'll integrate those into Juno's console in the next few days. I hope the JS BLS verification is rock solid, that's a great improvement!
