Hey everyone, Happy to Announce we have launched https://tuned.media/ 

AI music is currently to thriving in the most obscure corners of the internet, drawing an estimated 1 billion weekly plays and potentially missing out on $4 million in streaming revenue. What is not being tracked are all the .mp3 files being shared among discords and messages to friends - which is how I first came to be one of many millions scouring the internet looking for the next AI hit.

The reason it is so difficult to find AI Music is due to the fact AI Music exists in a legal grey area and streaming services (SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music) doing the big record labels bidding for them.

Only 14 U.S. states have established publicity laws, leaving a federal void. See https://hls.harvard.edu/today/ai-created-a-song-mimicking-the-work-of-drake-and-the-weeknd-what-does-that-mean-for-copyright-law/ and [AI-generated music is everywhere; is any of it legal?](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/ai-generated-music-is-everywhere-is-any-of-it-legal#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Copyright%20Office%20only,lines%20are%20already%20being%20drawn)

There currently is no centralized or decentralized place to upload, save, and distribute AI music - Until Now. ICP is ripe to capitalize on this - traditional streaming services will abide to requests from the big music labels, however, there is no legal reason for them to do so currently. The music can be stored onchain and no central authority can take it down.
