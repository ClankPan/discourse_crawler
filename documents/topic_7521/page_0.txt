Hey team,

I need to upload a few medium files (200Mb movies) for demonstrating our use case to use stream movie from canisters.

1) I was told by Alexa that bigmap and bigsearch are discountinued, so cannot be used anymore.

2) I was trying to deploy a canister containing with a few videos (ca. 250Mb each).
It succeeded with one video. I then tried deploying again but with 8 videos: it keeps failing after uploading a couple of videos, throwing:
An error happened during communication with the replica: error sending request for url (https://ic0.app/api/v2/canister/5qwoh-3aaaa-aaaai-aap5a-cai/call): http2 error: protocol error: unspecific protocol error detected

What could it mean?

3) I tried to use this example: https://github.com/krpeacock/file_upload_experiment/blob/main/src/declarations/file_upload_assets/file_upload_assets.did.js

but the motoko code isn't available

How can I proceed? Could you please advise on how to achieve this?

Thanks
