What extension is this / what unpkg package are you trying to use?

hello,

Resource URL: unpkg/@solana/web3.js@latest/lib/index.iife.js

when i add this line on my app i have error output

import { Actor, HttpAgent } from ‘./node_modules/@dfinity/agent/lib/cjs/index.js’;

this is the main error

“SyntaxError: import not found: HttpAgent”

thnx a lot.

So, we don't control the `@solana/web3.js` package, so I think that's not related.

Are you using `npm`? If so, why are you importing all the way from the `cjs` index? What tooling are you using where you're using both `unpkg` and `node_modules` in the same project? Are you following a particular guide?

Most of the time you should be fine with 
```ts
import {Actor, HttpAgent} from '@dfinity/agent';
```

Im using npm.

to say the truth i'm using claude opus 3.

i test both this lines and no one works 

import { Actor, HttpAgent } from './node_modules/@dfinity/agent/lib/cjs/index.js';
import { Actor, HttpAgent } from '@dfinity/agent';

Ah okay - this is beyond my ability to debug for you. Best of luck

well is not chatgpt at least!
chatgpt is total scam...

anyway if possible you can tell me better to choose unpkg and to remove npm connections right??

thnx a lot!

I'm much more familiar with `npm`, but I've explicitly configured the `unpkg` link to point to the ESM build, so it's particularly weird to have it use the CJS build.

I have no idea how this tool works, but I'd see if you can convince it to use npm and `vite` as a bundler

thank you!

i hope that this forum will have more attention in the future because on the first post a scammer answered to me.....giving scam links and saying that your tech issues will solve if you insert 700$ on your solana account.....
