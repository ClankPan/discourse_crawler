Generally speaking or today?

If today / now, it's probably related to the on going incident that is currently being treated

Every 2 weeks atleast ones... Not this bad, most of the time after reloading it works again fine. But it happens like i said atleast ones every 2 weeks. That's the reason i could not help myself posting this after so many times. 
In the meantime everything works again, but it's an issue that needs to be looked at in my opinion... 

Thanks for the reply anyways üôè

I spotted a thread on the forum about repeating downtime on DSocial (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/repeated-downtime-on-front-end-and-backend-canister-for-dsocial/14382), maybe it's related to your issue(s)?

I'll keep it in mind, if I hear / notice anything else will tell. Thanks for the ping!
