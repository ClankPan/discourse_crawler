Hey all, we've got a report of this issue from a user using a new iMac (M3)/safari: 
![image|690x388](upload://tt3nbCxNO5oEv4DDUjVbonQHHj5.jpeg)


I've heard this was occurring from query calls across other dapps, but couldn't find anything in the forums. Is this related to any recent issues with the boundary nodes? 

Also its only occurring on our persistant url (nuance.xyz) not our canisterid url (https://exwqn-uaaaa-aaaaf-qaeaa-cai.ic0.app).

Not sure which issue but I can confirm that all my dapps are working fine on their custom domain.

Can it be that the root cause of your issue is the fact that nuance.xyz certificate does not seem to be valid anymore? Or something related to the fact that agent-js host seem to be instantied differently on your custom domain?

Looks like we were defaulting to http somewhere down the line and that was causing issues. False alarm, thanks for looking into it!
