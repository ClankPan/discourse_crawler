Hi my question is regarding the staking process and the possible different strategies which are available.

Let’s say I stake 100 ICP for a a locked up period of 8 years and I want to follow the locked up compound strategy from the icp.guide. https://icp.guide/the-best-staking-strategy-to-maximize-liquid-icp/. At the time of staking I do not start the dissolve process until the 8 years a passed.

After the 8 years I start the dissolve process with a period of 6 months. 

Is this possible and is this corresponding with the locked up compound strategy ?

Thanks clarification

If you lock your ICP for 8 years (locked period), wait 8 years then start then dissolving process, you'll have to wait an additional 8 years (dissolve period).

So, (locked period) + (dissolve period) = how long you'll wait. In your case, 16 years.

You could set a dissolve delay of 6 months, keep it locked for 8 years, then start then dissolving process, which you would only have to wait 6 months in that scenario.

Thanks for you response. 

To get a withdrawal in 8,5 years, can I do the following:

- lockup ICPs for 8 years without starting the dissolve delay
- after waiting 6 month from beginning I start the dissolve delay with 8 years
- then withdraw will be in 8,5 years from the beginning 

Is that correct ?

That’s correct, yes.

Hi, i need help to understand better this.

I already stake for 6 month, I regret and tried to unlock, but i see is not possible to do that.  So i will wait for 6 month, but should I press the disolved button now to get the rewards and the unlock in 6 month?
thank you for your help
