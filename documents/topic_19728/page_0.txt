# Next Releases 
The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals this Friday, 2023-05-05.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## Additional Notes / Breaking Changes

This Cycles-Minting Canister upgrade will enable automatic exchange rate updates, allowing the Exchange Rate Proposals to be retired.  This will have an impact on the frequency of voting reward settlements on the NNS, and may result in some days having no rewards minted.  Those rewards will be rolled over and settled during the next reward period that has a proposal to settle, however.

```candid
(record { governance_canister_id = principal "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"; ledger_canister_id = principal "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"; exchange_rate_canister = opt variant { Set = principal "uf6dk-hyaaa-aaaaq-qaaaq-cai" } })
```
### Validating Candid Args
Verify that the hash of the args matches proposal contents.
`didc encode '(record { governance_canister_id = principal "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"; ledger_canister_id = principal "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"; exchange_rate_canister = opt variant { Set = principal "uf6dk-hyaaa-aaaaq-qaaaq-cai" } })' | xxd -r -p | sha256sum`
## Wasm Verification
Verify that the hash of the gzipped WASM matches the proposed hash.
