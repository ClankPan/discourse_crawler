Is there anything decently finished?

There's https://github.com/sudograph/sudograph but it looks forgotten and unmaintained
I also found https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm which can be compiled to wasm, but I bet it won't run on icp nor it was tested...

Storing stuff in memory is nice but can get complicated quiet fast, it also would be really nice to have a solid abstraction layer for data storage that is 
- simple to use
- scalable across multiple canisters
- can store hundreds of gigabytes of indexed data that is readily available for fetching

Is there anything battle tested in this area or is it yet to be created?

I suggest you also have a look at [CanDB](https://ykgs2-ziaaa-aaaak-qcfya-cai.icp0.io/). I don't think it has an SQL interface, but it could fit your use case pretty well
