YUKU | 2024-03-25 18:22:26 UTC | #1

Hello everyone,

We are preparing for the upcoming launch of Yuku DAO on the SNS. This marks a significant advancement in our endeavors at Yuku  AI Web3 Platform.

**What’s Yuku AI Web3 Platform?**

Yuku is not just a platform, it is a vibrant ecosystem that empowers individuals to participate in the evolution of the 3D space, fostering ownership, creativity, and community in the digital landscape. In the Yuku  AI Web3 platform users will experience a deeply interactive and personalized virtual space, where 3D Space, AI Avatars, and NFT aggregator collectively build a rich and diverse digital ecosystem.

**Yuku  AI Web3 Platform Core Features and Use Cases**

**3D Space**

Yuku provides a platform for various activities and events such as lectures, academic seminars, community events and e-commerce, embracing a wide range of interactive forms.

Is Yumi a separate platform? Any plans for Yuku to be able to sell RWA NFT's similar to Yumi?

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-02-29 09:08:47 UTC | #3

1- Yes, Yuku is as a DAO. A community owned NFT and Metaverse platform as such, it operates independently from Yumi. 
2- Currently, Yuku does not offer RWA NFTs. However, should the community request and approve it, Yuku could potentially offer RWA NFTs.
Please let us know if our response adequately addressed your question.

YUKU | 2024-02-29 10:25:46 UTC | #5

Thank you so much, we do appreciate your support!

-------------------------

Limestonecowboy | 2024-02-29 13:02:37 UTC | #6

This would be an excellent addition to the ICP SNS ecosystem 🤘😄

-------------------------

monetaryTheorist | 2024-02-29 15:30:09 UTC | #7

Wow, amazing! So glad to see the biggest IC metaverse project launching SNS. What is the plan for the cross-chain? Would Yuku token be bridged to other blockchains?

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-03-01 03:37:00 UTC | #8

Yes, we have a cross-chain plan outlined in Yuku's roadmap as detailed in our [whitepaper](https://yuku.app/whitepaper) 2024 Q3. 
Yuku tokens can potentially be bridged to Ethereum and Bitcoin using Chain-Key Technology or the Bitfinity Network. However, this process is subject to approval by the DAO in the future.

-------------------------

cuongngo89 | 2024-03-01 04:03:31 UTC | #9

How are credit points converted? How many tokens are in 1 credit? @YUKU

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-03-01 07:58:53 UTC | #10

Hi there! Yuku tokens and NFTs will be regularly airdropped to those holding Yuku credit. After receiving these rewards, the Yuku credit is reset back to zero. As for the conversion rate, it has yet to be determined. If you'd like to learn more, you can refer to Yuku's Tokenomics. Here is the [Whitepaper](https://yuku.app/whitepaper).

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-03-04 15:37:01 UTC | #11

Thanks a lot for DFINITY Foundation and ICP community's feedback, Yuku DAO updated SNS Swap percentage from "12%" to "17%". For the detail, please refer to [our whitepaper V1.1](https://yuku.app/whitepaper).

-------------------------

Bugslayer | 2024-03-05 16:24:53 UTC | #12

Hi,
How are you guys planning the token burn, It seems you are burning 5% tokens in the year 0, How do you guys allocate this percentage?

-------------------------

jwarner | 2024-03-05 22:45:51 UTC | #13

Hello, I couldn't find anything regarding who the development team is. Will you be providing any information on any of the founding/future team members?

Will individuals from the United States be geo-blocked from participating in the SNS sale?

I have tried to use the Yuku app multiple times and have ran into multiple bugs. I emailed [Contact@yuku.app](mailto:Contact@yuku.app) as well as sent a message on X weeks ago and never received responses from either place. Will there be any changes to the dapp prior to the SNS sale or will it stay in the current state until after launch?

Thanks!

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-06 08:42:36 UTC | #15

Hi Bugslayer, thank you for your questions. Yuku has accumulated quite some ICP revenue over the last 3 years. All these revenue will be used to buy back Yuku tokens and burn. Note that there is very low inflation rate of 0.1%. The revenue generated from NFT marketplace and metaverse space fee will be used to buy back and burn Yuku tokens, leading to a persistent deflation of the Yuku token.

-------------------------

Vivianannie | 2024-03-06 11:44:52 UTC | #16

Yea, it would be so nice to have yuku in the sns, its a promising project.

Hello everyone, I am Jason, the product manager of Yuku. Thank you very much for your support of Yuku. In the last couple of months, the Yuku team has been busy with the merging and development of the NFT market and the Metaverse. Meanwhile, the AI team has been working on the AI Avatar, which  will be released soon. Of course It's still in the testing phase. I asked our team's community manager to check the mailbox. I'm sorry to see your feedback landed in the spam email. We are always working hard to improve Yuku's user experience. At the same time, we will open a feedback window. You can make your suggestions to the Yuku team through Twitter, Telegram, email, etc as well. Once adopted, we will give you Yuku points, which can be exchanged for Yuku tokens in the future.

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-06 13:47:43 UTC | #20

Thank you very much for your support of Yuku

-------------------------

Avocado | 2024-03-06 13:54:50 UTC | #21

Good news. Do I understand correctly that you are no longer awarding Yuku credits to users?

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-06 14:12:21 UTC | #22

Hi Avocado, thank you for your questions. Users keep receiving Yuku credit for trading on Yuku. At the same time, we are adding more ways to earn credit so that more ICP users can earn Yuku credit.

-------------------------

jwarner | 2024-03-06 14:16:53 UTC | #23

Thank you for your reply. Can you answer my other two questions?

I couldn’t find anything regarding who the development team is. Will you be providing any information on any of the founding/future team members?

Will individuals from the United States be geo-blocked from participating in the SNS sale?

Thanks!

Hmm, I have some transactions on Yuku with [Avocado research collection](https://yuku.app/market/bjcsj-rqaaa-aaaah-qcxqq-cai) in recent days and Yuku credits have not credited. Maybe it doesn't work for all collections? Can you check?

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-07 06:26:46 UTC | #25

Due to the network congestion, there is a delay to show the credit after each transaction. Please check again. If it is still not credited, please reach out to contact@yuku.app. Our tech team will look into it. Thank you for your feedback.

Teto | 2024-03-07 14:05:11 UTC | #26

Hello @jwarner, I'm Teto Operation and Community Lead at Yuku Metaverse. Thank you for your inquiry! We appreciate your interest in Yuku. We are an international team with members located in various parts of the globe, working diligently to bring our vision to life. 
Regarding your question about geo-blocking, we are committed to ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations set by the SNS Launchpad and will provide updates on any restrictions or limitations as necessary. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to develop our platform.

-------------------------

IhsotasTon | 2024-03-07 14:05:15 UTC | #27

The typical problem for web3 projects is how to achieve mass adoption

-------------------------

jwarner | 2024-03-07 14:40:28 UTC | #28

Hi @Teto thanks for the response. 

When I asked if Yuku would be providing any information on founding/future team members, I meant names, development background, etc. I'll take your response as a "no."

Since geo-blocking the U.S. isn't necessary to launch an SNS, I'll take your response as a "we haven't decided yet."

Thank you and good luck on your sale!

-------------------------

monetaryTheorist | 2024-03-07 19:43:30 UTC | #29

just saw Yuku allows users to sign up and log in with emails. this is definitely a necessary step to welcome web2 users. bravo!

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-08 07:27:04 UTC | #32

very good point. Yuku allows users to log in via Email. You can try it on this link https://yuku.app/connect

ruby | 2024-03-08 08:46:04 UTC | #33

ICP ecosystem needs an NFT aggregator.

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-08 11:24:54 UTC | #34

Yes, we are currently actively developing and will launch collections on Entrepot in the near future. At the that time, you can purchase NFTs those are now listed on Entrepot on the Yuku, and will also support functions such as Sweep, batch listing, and batch transfer.

-------------------------

anywn | 2024-03-11 06:50:55 UTC | #35

Congratulations to Yuku for launching SNS, I look forward to your performance

-------------------------

IhsotasTon | 2024-03-11 07:06:05 UTC | #36

If Yuku has a legion of fans, count me among them. If Yuku has but one fan, that's me. And if Yuku has no fans, then the world hasn't discovered it yet, but they will — because I'll make sure of it.

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-11 09:55:04 UTC | #37

Thank you for your kind and warm support

-------------------------

Torli | 2024-03-12 06:46:38 UTC | #38

Hello Yuku, I saw information about Ai in the white paper and website. When can it be used?

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-12 10:23:32 UTC | #39

I'm glad you asked this question. At present, AI features have been tested internally and the beta version will be announced in the near future. Follow[ Yuku X account](https://twitter.com/yukumetaverse/) and stay stunned.

-------------------------

ruby | 2024-03-13 09:20:20 UTC | #40

Wow  that’s great Looking forward to it

-------------------------

sophia | 2024-03-13 10:07:54 UTC | #41

So everyone can customize AI Avatar? I'm gonna make a cool one. Hope there would be a race :)

-------------------------

ruby | 2024-03-14 02:37:52 UTC | #42

If so I hope a match will be arranged！！

-------------------------

q2333gh | 2024-03-14 04:57:38 UTC | #43

Is yuku opensource yet ?

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-14 06:09:37 UTC | #44

Of course, you can customize your own Ai Avatar. Contest is a good idea

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-14 06:11:09 UTC | #45

Good question, we are actively preparing it and it will be available to everyone soon

-------------------------

curry | 2024-03-14 14:33:03 UTC | #46

Can you public the sns_init.yaml file?

-------------------------

Jason | 2024-03-15 08:17:16 UTC | #47

Of course, we will open source it together with the code on github

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-15 08:27:03 UTC | #48

Hello @curry absolutely, the sns_int.yaml file will be made public to each and everyone.

-------------------------

cymqqqq | 2024-03-18 06:34:01 UTC | #49

Hey, Yuku congratulations for all your recent improvements, could you tell us more about the Yuku credit?

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-18 10:56:34 UTC | #50

Hello @cymqqqq, users accumulate Yuku credits by completing a variety of tasks on www.yuku.app. These tasks include signing up, logging in, playing games, trading NFTs, creating a metaverse space, visiting other metaverse spaces, and referring friends, among others. Yuku tokens and NFTs are frequently airdropped to users holding Yuku credit. Upon receiving these rewards, the credit is reset to zero, allowing users to participate in more activities and earn rewards again.

-------------------------

Limestonecowboy | 2024-03-18 13:27:25 UTC | #51

Love hearing that this project will be going through the SNS process soon! I read of customization on the platform and was wondering in vr backgrounds will be available as well (sorry if this has already been addressed elsewhere). I thought it would be cool to have an avatar AND background in an OpenFPL theme 😀

-------------------------

jgsleepy101 | 2024-03-18 14:48:59 UTC | #52

-------------------------

MichaleTicknor | 2024-03-18 18:10:45 UTC | #55

Building on ICP offers advantages, but also potential constraints. How does Yuku plan to handle the rendering of complex 3D spaces, high user traffic during events, and real-time interactions, ensuring a seamless and lag-free experience, particularly on mobile devices?

-------------------------

roselynj49 | 2024-03-18 18:11:18 UTC | #56

Will there be backup liquidity to support the SNS and keep it at a relevant price? 
What are your longterm goals for Yuku SNS and how long do you think your SNS can last for?

[/quote]

**Yuku DAO SNS** is good ????

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-19 05:58:51 UTC | #61

As a DAO, that decision can be put to a vote and approved by the community.

-------------------------

TalcottOsvaldo | 2024-03-19 08:14:09 UTC | #62

How will Yuku's platform empower artists and creators? Will there be tools to combat NFT plagiarism, manage royalties, and provide clear analytics to creators regarding their NFT's performance in the secondary market?

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-19 09:26:49 UTC | #63

Yuku has consistently supported artists and creators, primarily through free marketing across our diverse channels. Moreover, Yuku stands out as the most affordable platform for minting NFT collections and 1:1 art pieces on ICP. With royalties embedded in the canisters, artists receive automatic distributions. As for analytics, Yuku already offers a range of tools, and we're tirelessly striving to incorporate additional features.

-------------------------

coe | 2024-03-19 10:08:34 UTC | #64

The YUMY or YUKU development team has been working since the beginning and gifted unique tools to the ICP ecosystem. YUKU team has built without expectations and today we can support in attracting capital.
Your economic part is exciting... YUKU is off to a strong start and can undoubtedly paint a great vision for the future of Metaverse.

YUKU can integrate well with artificial intelligence projects in the ecosystem and show a unique future.

In the development of the platform, also focus on online translators, the border between the speaking time of countries. We can run the biggest meetings and events at YUKU.
You can schedule events where you must have the relevant NFTs. or events that require payment to attend. The education industry can provide a significant part of the income of the YUKU platform, if this financial interaction is done in a decentralized manner, it can be linked to the token structure and bring value growth.

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-19 11:36:57 UTC | #65

Could you clarify if the YUKU operates solely on the Internet Computer (IC) protocol, or does it incorporate a mix of technologies, including Amazon Web Services, IPFS, and other Web 2.0 dependencies? Additionally, is it feasible for the platform to go SNS while relying on Amazon-related dependencies? Are there any specific deadlines or plans for transitioning to a 100% Internet Computer infrastructure, if such a transition is in consideration?
All this questions only if YUKU is not 100% on IC. 
Thank you.

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-19 11:40:54 UTC | #66

Thank you for appreciating our efforts. Your encouragement serves as great motivation for the Yuku team to continue building and enhancing our established products ❤️

@YUKU No answer yet. Does it mean YUKU is 100% on IC without any dependecies on AWS and other Web 2.0 services?

-------------------------

ShamelessTrades | 2024-03-19 18:17:45 UTC | #72

Is the sns1 token used for this dao?

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-20 03:00:56 UTC | #73

Hello @alexander, I wanted to honestly inform you that we are not 100% on-chain yet, but the encrypted assets have been deployed on the blockchain. The off-chain portion is distributed across several major cloud service providers for user experience purposes. Additionally, Yuku is collaborating with the Dfinity Foundation to migrate more of Yuku's technology onto the IC. Furthermore, Yuku is applying for AI grants from Dfinity, which also involves on-chain and off-chain interactions.

-------------------------

Teto | 2024-03-20 03:06:10 UTC | #74

Hello @DarthMeta, within the Yuku metaverse, we offer 3D Spaces, akin to lands, available in both public and private settings. Visit our website at yuku.app to experience them firsthand.

Great to see Yuku on the path to becoming an SNS!

I might have missed it but I haven't seen a technical architecture overview (besides the very abstract figure in the whitepaper) including disclosures of elements that are outside of the ICP and hence not under direct DAO control.

Hi, ICP community,
Check Yuku source code on [Yuku Github](https://github.com/yukuapp/).
Yuku team

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-03-21 17:14:51 UTC | #91

Hi, ICP community,
Check Yuku DAO SNS [sns_init.yaml](https://github.com/yukuapp/yuku_marketplace_ic/blob/main/sns/sns_init.yaml).
Yuku team

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-21 16:55:47 UTC | #92

I'm unable to find the code related to what I believe are the major components of this project, namely: Metaverse, 3D Space, and AI Avatar. While there are impressive demo videos, I can't find any corresponding code. All I see are static images, the web platform itself, and a significant (yet incomplete) portion of code for the NFT Marketplace. To avoid unnecessary speculation and incorrect assumptions, could you please provide a description of what has been uploaded to GitHub? The project showcases appealing demo videos for Education, Metaverse, and E-commerce. Will these aspects be managed differently, not through the current SNS/DAO? I need help understanding, as I'm quite lost

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-21 17:34:29 UTC | #93

I agree. It's one thing to have a project description, but I'm keen to technically understand how everything will function to ensure it's not merely an attractive facade. They've recently uploaded the code to GitHub, but largely, it seems quite barren. @YUKU

-------------------------

alexander | 2024-03-21 17:45:45 UTC | #94

Another question still hangs in the air without a definitive answer: details about the team. How many people are on the team, what's their level of experience, and do they have a track record of previously successful projects? Given the ambitious and complex nature of the project, there are serious doubts about whether there's a capable team to bring it to fruition. Moreover, there's a lack of clear understanding regarding the technical execution, with the GitHub repository showing only a fraction of what has been described. At this point, it's all concerns, but regardless, best of luck with the SNS!

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-03-23 06:47:26 UTC | #95

Yes, we have 50 million YUKU tokens airdrop for Yuku Credit holders and others. Please find more details in our whitepaper. Thank you for your question.

-------------------------

YUKU | 2024-03-23 17:09:11 UTC | #96

Hi Alexander, thanks a lot for your question and suggestion. there is no doubt that you are a big fan of ICP ecosystem. At the same time, Yuku is also an OG project (over 2 and half years) of ICP ecosystem, as well known by ICP family.

Regarding the Yuku GitHub open-source:

At present, our GitHub repository mainly contains part of the project code, especially the NFT aggregator code that has been uploaded, we will continue to update and improve the rest parts.

For the code for 3D Space and AI Avatar you mentioned, we are actively improving it and plan to upload the source code to GitHub shortly.

Our goal is to ensure that all the components of the project can be presented and reviewed in an open-source manner.

In addition, we not only focus on the video promotion, as shown on our homepage and twitter, many functions are online and have been experienced by ICP family, such as meta-ama meeting system, AI skybox, art gallery, NFT aggregator, NFT launchpad, OAT functions. Furthermore, more amazing functions are cooking.

-------------------------

1
I’m looking forward to the metaverse! I want to have my own art gallery. Is it possible for anyone to create art there? Are there any costs or conditions involved?|

2
Do you have any strategies for attracting visitors?|

3
Will it be possible to operate it from a smartphone someday?|

Of course, you can create your own art gallery for free. We are currently actively preparing for the mobile version as we know that the mobile version will be the most popular.
