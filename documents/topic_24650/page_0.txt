**[TRAX](https://trax.so)** is preparing to launch its SNS DAO and expects to begin the decentralization sale soon.

This forum serves as an opportunity for the IC community to discuss the TRAX SNS and ask questions.

TRAX's mission is to support the music industry with better tools to connect artists with their fans.

TRAX is a social marketplace for music, powered by the Internet Computer. TRAX enables music artists to retain full ownership of their content and monetisation and forge new relationships with their fans, whilst leveraging cutting-edge web3 tooling. 

At TRAX, we believe in the power of music to onboard the next 1 million+ to the Internet Computer. Join us on our journey to revolutionise the music industry!

Please refer to the [proposal summary](https://github.com/onlyontrax/TraxDAO/blob/main/sns/sns_proposal_summary.md) and [TRAX DAO whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-NefE8Pqsp5qbKb6TPj3tE1J2e7qWCYu1_FwuLdLF8/edit?usp=sharing) for more details.

Tokenomics and SNS configuration can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/171YTZD6d6-BfWjni3WWaB75iwZRvqNqy87sJcu4f20M/edit#gid=1391375672)

It is recommended to review these documents before asking questions, as they may already contain answers. We will endeavour to answer questions on the forum or please reach out to the team on [X.](https://twitter.com/onlyontrax)

**UPDATE [28/11/2023]**

We are pleased to announce the open-sourcing of the TRAX codebase, in preparation for handing governance of the dApp to the SNS.

The NNS Proposal to create an SNS named 'TRAX' is now [LIVE.](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126119)

-------------------------

adamsmith | 2023-11-13 18:05:14 UTC | #2

I'm looking forward to seeing how TRAX's journey unfolds and the impact it will have on both the music world and the broader blockchain ecosystem. It's initiatives like these that drive innovation and create new opportunities for artists and fans alike. Best of luck to the TRAX team!

xSkApOnEx | 2023-11-13 18:14:54 UTC | #3

I am excited to see what comes of this. You have my full support as always!

domwoe | 2023-11-13 18:55:29 UTC | #4

Hey @tatruso,

In case you missed this, I just wanted to make you aware, that the activation of matched funding is currently up for vote: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-updates-nov-10-2023-matched-funding-for-sns-swaps-stable-memory-migration-for-nns-neurons/24578

This changes the mechanics of how the Neuron Fund will participate if a project requests participation from the Neuron Fund. You can read more about it here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/suggested-enhancements-to-the-community-fund/20411/7.

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-13 19:07:13 UTC | #5

Thanks @domwoe - we’ve seen the changes and happy with them. Apart from changes to the config file, is there anything else we should be aware of?

-------------------------

Moses | 2023-11-13 21:00:21 UTC | #6

Who are the seed funders, the NFT holders only or there are other seed funders?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-13 21:36:12 UTC | #7

We received seed funding from an angel investor in the ecosystem. I won't name him but the entire ecosystem is fortunate to have him.

  Music is one of the greatest things we have in this world TRAX MAY YOU HAVE A GREAT SNS SALE Dr Deeds  It will be a great project for the ICP MEMBERS

-------------------------

ishaaqziyan | 2023-11-14 13:57:31 UTC | #9

I am really excited about this.
Btw, wen Mobile App?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-14 14:11:29 UTC | #10

Great question! 

We think a mobile app will boost adoption of TRAX and make it easier for fans to stay up-to-date with their favourite creators on the platform. 
Ideally, we want to get a v1 mobile app out in Q1 next year, this is one of the reasons we are raising. Apple's App Store has some rules that interfere quite heavily with our business model but we have a few ideas on how to get round these regulations. Focus over the last few months has been on decentralising the majority of our app to run on the IC. Will be sharing updates on this later in the week.

-------------------------

ishaaqziyan | 2023-11-14 15:16:21 UTC | #11

Wonderful!
Looking forward to those updates!

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2023-11-16 10:40:11 UTC | #12

There will also be a new version of the Tokenomics Google Sheet reflecting the changes made to the Neuron Funds investment. @bjoernek will keep you posted on this. 
Did you already prepare your `sns_init.yaml` file?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-16 11:25:43 UTC | #13

Thanks, is this the same as what we are discussing in this thread? https://forum.dfinity.org/t/difference-in-sns-config-files-yml-yaml/24708/3

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-11-21 13:42:06 UTC | #14

Hey @tatruso,

We've released a new version of the SNS Tokenomics Analyzer which supports matched funding and the latest version of the SNS init config file. The Tokenomics Google Sheet won't be updated to support matched funding and can be considered deprecated.

tomimas1990 | 2023-11-23 17:33:40 UTC | #16

i still do not understand, what prevents one to copy the sound file to a mp3 and load it up somewhere else?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-23 18:19:26 UTC | #17

Decades of intellectual property law.

-------------------------

tomimas1990 | 2023-11-23 19:14:32 UTC | #18

so what is the difference then between trax and youtube, except the way of data storage?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-23 21:25:17 UTC | #19

YouTube operates on an advertising model, where content providers receive a small cut of revenue generated from advertising.

TRAX operates a marketplace model, where fans pay artists directly for content (similar to OnlyFans or Patreon), returning more compensation to the value creator (the artist).

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-23 21:26:41 UTC | #20

Thanks for joining the forum 4 hours ago and using your first post to undermine a years worth of work by a hardworking team and growing community of artists though…

MrBennyP | 2023-11-23 21:32:00 UTC | #22

What kind of question is this?

-------------------------

tomimas1990 | 2023-11-23 21:44:23 UTC | #24


i am on the rim of being an investigator (paying accually for the “hardworking team”) and i need answers before risking money, no?

and idnt one purpose of a forum to ask questions and not only applaude everything?

and although i thank you for your posts, i hope your salt will not prevent me or others  try to find more undermining questions.

-------------------------

tomimas1990 | 2023-11-23 22:59:30 UTC | #25

hi-
do you know, if the trax coin is used only for tipping or do you need it for uploading or viewing, too?
is the music stored directly on trax chain or on a 3rd party storage provider?

-thx for your knowledge

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-11-24 19:07:33 UTC | #26

These questions are responded in the **[Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-NefE8Pqsp5qbKb6TPj3tE1J2e7qWCYu1_FwuLdLF8/edit?usp=sharing)**, so I suggest to **use resources of your payed and hard-working team to get through it in detail first**.

Note, that also other links in the **[initial topic comment](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-trax-sns-decentralisation-sale/24650?u=plsak)** might be very helpful in your investigation.

tomimas1990 | 2023-11-25 03:18:07 UTC | #28

hi-
i need still help, stupid me.
i read your white paper link. thank you!

but i cant find anything about the storage source. it says true web3, so i asume the data are stored on the TRAX chain?
under section **5.1.2.1 Upload**, it does not specifically says, where data is uploaded to.

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-11-25 10:50:49 UTC | #29

Hope this helps.

1. on ICP there is no such thing as TRAX chain, TRAX is a dApp running on ICP
2. canister is a smart contract on ICP
3.

borovan | 2023-11-25 11:01:38 UTC | #31

Why 1.5MB, did you find any sort of technical barrier stopping you being closer to the 2MB limit?

-------------------------

plsak | 2023-11-25 11:24:09 UTC | #32

I think this question is for @tatruso as I'm not involved in TRAX project.

-------------------------

Francis | 2023-11-25 14:13:55 UTC | #33

This has since changed to 1.9MB. At the time of writing the white paper the smart contract had not yet been optimised for performance. Considering the block size limit is 4MB, we decided to opt for a chunk size just below the ingress limit of 2MB. This allows room for other ingress messages with potentially higher priority to be included, and did not want to be limited to one payload per block which could lead to a slower upload speed.

Unfortunately this happens a lot on the forum.  It's best to anonymously flag posts as inappropriate, off topic, or spam and let the moderators handle it.  This way you don't have to feed the trolls and can stay focused on the intellectually honest deliberation of your post.  Just click the three dots below the message and then click the flag icon.  A popup will guide you through the rest.  It's quick and painless and anonymous.  The moderators will decide if the post should be hidden or deleted.  Some of this process is automated so it goes in effect immediately, especially if multiple people flag the comment.

Anyway, thanks for your post and good luck with your SNS decentralization sale.

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-25 15:20:33 UTC | #35

Great, thanks for letting me know, wasn’t aware of this/how to do it! Thanks for your support :slightly_smiling_face:

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2023-11-27 13:19:57 UTC | #36

@tatruso as the tokenomics sheet has been deprecated, can you please share the `sns_init.yaml` file that you're using for the sale?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-27 15:28:51 UTC | #37

Here is the config file: 
https://github.com/onlyontrax/TraxDAO/blob/main/sns/sns_init.yaml

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-27 20:56:19 UTC | #38

**UPDATE:**

Following our conversation with the DFINITY team, we have reduced the dissolve delay for the airdrop allocation, bringing Voting Rights for Developer Neurons under the 50% threshold. 

This will prevent the Developer Neurons from draining the treasury/"rugging" via a 51% attack, as was the case with BoomDAO & ICX SNS treasuries. 

Thanks to @domwoe, @cryptoschindler and @bjoernek for assisting with testing of our SNS config file. 
We invite community members to review the updated [Config file](https://onlyontrax/TraxDAO/blob/main/sns/sns_init.yaml)

I'm pleased to say we are now SNS ready and the proposal should be up shortly!

ckMood | 2023-11-27 23:14:34 UTC | #40

@tatruso I'm finding it absolutely impossible to sign in to TRAX with my II. It keeps taking me to an NFID webpage which I can't seem to see up with an II or my Gmail either. How can I log in and create an account myself? I will try plug if I can't get into it using another method. I'd rather not use my Gmail.

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-27 23:57:29 UTC | #41

Hi! Yeah, sorry about this. We patched an issue with NFID and it messed up the Internet Identity button so now both direct to NFID! Will hopefully be patched sometime tomorrow. Might be a good opportunity to test the new Plug mobile app in the meantime! :smile:

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-27 23:59:33 UTC | #42

Actually, fix is in the queue. Should be available very soon :slight_smile:

The provided link to the SNS init file is broken. I assume you meant to provide https://github.com/onlyontrax/TraxDAO/blob/main/sns/sns_init.yaml, correct ? 

Can you confirm that this file on Github, is the one which you used for the proposal submission ?

Yes, this is the sns_init.yaml file we are using. The path to it is the same but github.com was omitted from the start for some reason.

cryptoschindler | 2023-11-28 11:23:04 UTC | #48

Also, have you conducted an audit for the payments canister? If not, could you please explain why you think this is not necessary?

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-28 11:42:36 UTC | #49

Good point! Have now updated the main post with the corresponding Canister IDs.

-------------------------

tatruso | 2023-11-28 11:48:01 UTC | #50

The smart contracts facilitate payments but we do not have custody over user funds so an audit has not been an immediate priority, as it might be for a De-Fi project, for instance. 

It is of course important to have code audited but there have been instances of audits taking months (if not years) e.g. Finterest and delaying product development without good reason.

-------------------------

adamsmith | 2023-11-28 12:55:18 UTC | #51

Finally a dApp that will attract new users to IC network. Decentralized music, videos... this is what the IC is all about. I wish you all the best!

Yasharsaljoughi | 2023-12-13 10:01:23 UTC | #55

Yeah i see!
My mistake was i dissolving it about 3 months ago and last night i stop it to put more icp and start it again then i see oh i can't vote any more!

-------------------------

Yasharsaljoughi | 2023-12-13 10:04:04 UTC | #56

Is there other way to vote? Because i am a old user of sns but with mistake i dissolved my icp.

When will be the token distributed?

-------------------------

jorn | 2023-12-24 14:54:20 UTC | #60

Have all $TRAX been distributed yet? I’m still missing my allocation. (Or refund of committed ICP.)

-------------------------

molokanov50 | 2023-12-25 07:50:26 UTC | #61

The same situation. I still have zero balance on TRAX

-------------------------

RMCS | 2023-12-25 08:37:48 UTC | #62

@jorn @molokanov50 after participating in an SNS sale you get your tokens in the form of neurons which needs to be disbursed. 

So instead of checking your balance you need to check “My neuron staking” page and select Trax. There should be a couple of neurons with 1 that can be disbursed immediately. After disbursing it’s going to show up in your balance.

-------------------------

molokanov50 | 2023-12-25 09:13:55 UTC | #63

@RMCS thank you for your explanations!

-------------------------

jorn | 2023-12-25 09:47:47 UTC | #64

Hey @RMCS , thanks for responding.  My problem is that this simply did not happen.

Seems I committed the very moment the launch ended. Somehow the process could not complete.  The ICP I committed was sent but no confirmation ever received.  I can see it as a sent transaction still sitting idly in some address.  The launchpad section in nns displays TRAX as if I had not participated at all.  Also there are no TRAX neurons.

I'm wondering who can help debug this to either complete the swap so I can take part in the TRAX or revert the swap so that I can get my ICP back.

-------------------------

nnnnnnsssss | 2023-12-26 15:47:02 UTC | #65

Like it one future🔮Congratulations to you if you are going to make better changes with the latest technology.

-------------------------

levi | 2023-12-26 22:04:09 UTC | #66

@jorn Try calling this method on the TRAX sns swap canister: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ezrhx-5qaaa-aaaaq-aacca-cai#error_refund_icp. Put your nns principal id. I think you can call the method straight from the dashboard at that link. I never used it for myself but I think it is meant for this purpose.

-------------------------

-------------------------

ckMood | 2024-06-15 14:39:40 UTC | #68

Who can I contact or how can I speak with someone from TRAX? I’ve been very active in the TRAX DAO OpenChat and there are quite a few people there asking questions and no one from TRAX is there to answer or anything. We’re sort of left to our own devices there, literally. I believe this is a wasted resource and opportunity as open chat is a very useful tool for community building. I’ve seen meme coins grow obscenely fast so with the right marketing and effort TRAX DAO OC can grow and foster collaboration I believe but it appears Tom hasn’t been online there in 112 days so it feels like not much effort is put in there. I’d like to get in contact with someone to discuss a few things and get the OpenChat engaging and growing.

-------------------------

DigitaSoja | 2024-06-15 18:03:51 UTC | #69

Thank you for raising this.
I have tried to contact them on IG where they actively posts, and some other socials
 No response.
