The landing page for our website, [synapse.vote](https://www.synapse.vote/), explains the difference between the two neurons.

If you want to know the exact configuration of both, you can go to our neuron configuration page [here](https://www.synapse.vote/neuron-configuration).

If you want to confirm our configuration for Synape.vote (NEW), then you can look it up on the dashboard ([NeuronID 5553849921138062661](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/5553849921138062661?pm-s=100)).  Known neurons have a pages dedicated to their description, voting history, and neuron management history.  Since the Synapse (NEW) neuron has no known private key, it can only be configured using the Neuron Management proposal topic.  Followees for the Neuron Management proposal topic have full control of the neuron (except to disperse ICP since that is prohibited by code for decentralized neurons).

Below are the latest proposals that were used to configure the Synapse (NEW) neuron...
Neuron Management - [Proposal 125059](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125059)
Governance - [Proposal 125058](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125058)
SNS and Neuron's Fund - [Proposal 125057](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125057)
Replica Version Management - [Proposal 125056](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125056)
System Canister Management - [Proposal 126041](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126041)
All Topics catch all - [Proposal 125055](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/125055)

If I keep following "synapse(original)", can I be sure that all proposals are still voted?

Yes.  

Synapse (original) is configured to follow Synapse (NEW) on everything.  We actively manage our participation in governance on all topics and all proposals and we make adjustments as needed to ensure maximum participation.

It is a priority to ensure that our high voting participation is also based on intentional and active voting by credible Followees.  We have no bots that cast automatic votes and we do not follow anyone who we do not think is credible on each individual proposal topic.
