Reading the [SNS.yaml example](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/sns/cli/sns_init_template.yaml) and I'm noticing that the SNS title and Token name have similar minimal length, 4 bytes, but different maximal length, 256 vs 255 bytes.

So just though about asking in case that would by a typo?

```
NnsProposal:
    # The title of the NNS proposal. Must be a string of 4 to 256 bytes.
    title: ~

Token:
    # The name of the token issued by the SNS ledger.
    # Must be a string of 4 to 255 bytes without leading or trailing spaces.
    name: ~
```

The greatest allowed number of bytes for the NNS proposal title is 256, and the greatest allowed number of bytes for the token name is 255. So the documentation is accurate W.R.T. the SNS proposal's validation. I believe the discrepancy comes from the authors of the ICRC1 spec just making a different choice for the maximal length of the name

Thanks for the confirmation.
