[Use the default cycles wallet](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/working-with-canisters.html#developers-guide:default-wallet.adoc) is  NoOp link. 

Is it me it is a typo somewhere?

Hi thanks for reporting this link issue. Can you clarify  the page that had the non-functioning link? It seems like the link in your post goes to Manage canisters but I canâ€™t tell where it came from, so Iâ€™m not sure where the fi should be. 

Thanks for your assistance ðŸ˜Š. We greatly appreciate the involvement from the community!

It is next article after Manage Canisters in the three view. Clicking it produces NoOp. Copying the link gives me the link I posted.

I think the broken link is in the navigation bar on the left, just below the `Manage ...` topic. @lsgunn
