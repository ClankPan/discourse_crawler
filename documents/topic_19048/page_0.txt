THIS THREAD IS MEANT TO BE A MORE REFINED DISCUSSION POINT FOR DEVELOPERS TO COLLABORATIVELY WORK ON: 

1. Developing a KYT canister that incorporates multiple regulators. (because itâ€™s highly likely that a decision has been made to permanentlyâ€¦let toniq be an oversight body of ckbtc) 

2. Developing a non-KYT ckbtc (although this might be hard; if some of dfinity employees chip in then itâ€™s just a matter of time.) 

3. Start design of a SNS model that would hand over ckbtc business operations to the community.Community participation is highly needed as not a single entity can be up against dfinity but rather have a reasonable working relationship towards the future of decentralization. 

Rather than complaining about decisions we have no control of it is better for the community to collectively put genius minds together to create a future that all can be comfortable living in. Best of luck to interested parties. Let the work begin ðŸ’¯

This should NOT be hard - the ckBTC canister that includes KYT is in the [open-source repo](https://github.com/dfinity/ic). Not sure about the exact location - not my area of expertise. Stripping the KYT parts out of the code should be very simple.
