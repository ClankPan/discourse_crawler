Have an old identity created November 2022 and used until now on a Windows PC with Halo activated and was using the windows login PIN (not having a fingerprint reader or IR webcam). Now I want to sell the old PC and bought a new laptop that will run Linux. As far as I know, please correct me if I am wrong the only way to use II on Linux is with a Yubikey (probably some higher end ones with fingerprint reader that has appropriate driver support could work, it's not the case for mine it doesnt' have one).
Now the question is how to migrate it in the safest possible way since it has some 8 year neurons attached with some large amounts of ICP (large for me). One thing to note is that I lost my seed phrase (or at least it is hard to recover the file from the second HDD that crashed).
Looking for a safe step by step guide from anyone who has done this, thank you so much in advance.

On your current windows pc, connect to identity.ic0.app authenticating with your PIN. Then click on add new passkey, then connect the yubikey add create an additional passkey for the yubikey. See here for more information to add a passkey and reset your recovery phrase:

I use the 1Password extension's passkey feature for webauthn on Linux
