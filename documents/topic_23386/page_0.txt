Hi all!
This is Zondax. We have developed a C wrapper for the IC [rust Agent](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/agents/), which allows easy deployment for any C++ projects on IC. We believe it can be helpful for game developers, particularly those using Unreal Engine. By doing this, we would like to enhance ICâ€™s accessibility and invite a broader community of creators.
We had the opportunity to participate at the ICP.Lab this year and we got to meet so many talented teams that are currently creating video games in the metaverse. We received their feedback and we would appreciate yours as well.

Here's the repository: https://github.com/Zondax/icp-client-cpp
