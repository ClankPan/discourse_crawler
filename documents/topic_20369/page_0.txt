Let's brainstorm amazing dApp ideas together! 
We're interested in the kind of dApps people would love to see out in the world. If a particular dApp idea gains enough interest, we can create separate threads and even consider issuing Bounties to seek talented developers who might be interested in bringing these ideas to fruition. 

Your input and creativity are highly valued here!

I'll go ~~first~~ second:

# Swap Canister
A canister that allows for P2P swaps of any assets (Tokens, NFTs). Two (or possibly more) parties can create a `swap` and the swap canister acts as a secure and trustless escrow. With the direct bitcoin integration and the Phase 1 of the ETH integration, this could even include cross chain swaps.

A tiny dApp that keeps track of all SNS proposals.
Users can vote directly in the app and manage followees.
Followees can be added by users with a short description and the app shows the recent voting activity of these neurons, so you don't follow a dead neuron.

I can share the ideas for DApps that I would definitely build with [Juno](https://juno.build/), if I had time. ;)

- A time tracking dapp: I would port my existing time tracking app (https://tietracker.com) onto the blockchain.
- An AI-powered image generation DApp: This DApp would utilize AI to generate images and store them on the blockchain, allowing for a flexible format. This feature would be useful for creating social cards for DApps.
- An on-chain alternative to Formspree**
- An on-chain alternative to Mailchimp**
- A website for my retired dad, showcasing his hobby of painting  üòÅ (his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/giancarlodalbusco/))

** these two would need http outcalls which is not yet implemented within Juno

ICP currently lacks traffic, I will make all chain cross-chain centers supported by chain-key technology, not only BTC and ETH! Ltc, the doge, etc, the doge, sol, dot, cosmos, shib the more the better, because each additional chain can increase user and liquidity, just need to let people know, ICP is risk-free across chain center, we can get to encrypt the world first-class amount entrance! But I don't have the technology. I hope the foundation can pay attention to this idea

Can ICP provide users with VPN services, pledge ICP or use ICP to purchase and use? It seems that VPN software in the encrypted world can gain many loyal users

I totally agree with integrating as many other chains as possible. There could be a specialized team for it doing only that. Every chain in the Top 100 should be integrated.

I would make one exception and just boycott Solana.

Yes, let's finish the Swapping service. Even DAOs will be able to trade with it. I've just started it, but it needs some more to get to production. 

Feel free to complete it. I am currently swamped with work on Neutron

:space_invader: Blackholed canister that stores (timestamp + hash + principal + opt meta text) indefinitely, paid for with cycles.
You can use it to prove something. For example, you hash a file and store it, later you can prove you had that file on a particular date. No need to upload the whole file.
Or a blockchain that periodically stores hashes from its transaction log to prove it didn't modify them.

Spreadsheet based smart contracts or an interpreter for spreadsheet formats that IC dApps can use to run a spreadsheet on chain, imagine being able to define vesting schedules, tokenomics, etc.. without having to mess around with code. 
A little bit over an year ago I was working on a project and wanted to give users as much options as possible to define vesting schedules and realized to achieve what I wanted I either had to implement some kind of scripting language or spreadsheets, most non technical people are used to tools like Excel to interact with ledgers and I believe such a thing could create a lot of interesting use cases and make Web3 more accessible.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-06-01 17:02:45 UTC | #20

@Zane I've been thinking about that. Spreadsheets are the killer app for PC since the 80s and still are. No wonder Apple, Microsoft, and Google have their own. Just not sure what the angle is exactly. That will be a perfect app for Neutron.

So what is the Internet!

Is it a place for everyone to defile, extort and recruit for their beliefs to make them the most powerful and the richest person on earth?

Is it a place to spend most of my time and go nowhere?

Or is it a place of communication for my needs?

I have a home address and when you know that address you know where to find me, should I not have an address on the internet where the people who need to be in contact with me have my address and those I do not know, don‚Äôt?

I have a letter box and find those who want to get my attention don‚Äôt care that I have a message that states, no spam and a ex who thought it would be great idea to provide my email address to the dark side of the web and has driven me mad with my spam folder full of the uninvited.

Just like my screen that is invaded with many forms of uninvited messages that I don‚Äôt want or care for and now that has been extended to my mobile.

Is it the intention of WEB3 builders to now protect those who I don‚Äôt want to be connected to and give them the right to harassment, fraud and lie.

So far I see more of the same, shopping, games, chat, video but no moral compass.

Should we not be building a set of standards that is lacking in WEB2 and not just building what is already out there.

The IC has created the basis to be removed from the people YOU give names to like powerful which you claim your disapproval of and then your idea is to do the same!

Should we not adopt the systems that have been in use forever and proven like every person who has a home address where you hold your personal details in one place and update in one place as my personal information is not yours and when I need to update my personal information I have to go everywhere to make changes for those who are permitted by me to have access to my personal information, yes that's right, make Governments conform to using a standard to rid duplication.

That if someone is not permitted in my communications then they are not permitted, unsubscribing is a weak and deplorable standard and I should be able to exclude sites that I have to tick the conditions of use or want my email address to continue.

I am not weak that I believe I have to provide anyone with my email or any other personal information and will exit any page that thinks that I have to do that. 

Like the food shop last week, if I wanted to order food I had to go online, download an app, login in and provide all my personal information while advertising to order from a counter just meters away. 

NO, I used the door and went somewhere else. 

The success of the top web companies in the world and this will include crypto in the future is not those who scam, spam and behave poorly, they are those who build standards from the bottom up and not the superficial.

I want to see WEB3 like my TV, be able to select what I want to view and the power off button for those I don‚Äôt.

Why not an incognito set of standards to the sites where information should not be collected like banking, no, not porn and gambling, that is my choice not yours.

To me there seems to be 3 types, those who like to dress up their genitals, those who follow and those who see differently.

I would like to see the IC extended not for financial transactions but the standard that all organizations use as the platform to communicate and transact in a secure environment where hackers and spammers have to get a real job and I get provided the home address of the people I can make responsible for their cowardness.

Should we be building the same old, who isn‚Äôt or should we build on top of this project all the missing parts that we know and can see are needed when using the WEB instead of the fastest way possible to the superficial for gratification, power and money?

The idea behind crypto was to replace fiat currencies because you can only trust governments to destroy systems and then they are handed off to private industry.

I want to see the IC take on the standards of how to do business on the web by voting as a decentralized system.

Very excited about this thread.  I wanted to drop a note that as a part of our new KPIs, the [Neurotic Podcast](http://neuroticpod.com) is actively looking to help refer projects to the DFINITY Dev Grant program.

icper | 2023-06-03 12:25:31 UTC | #24

There is no doubt that it is AI APP. The only disadvantage of the world's top 30 blockchains is AI. If ICP can create practical application of AI, it can seize this wave of traffic inlet and completely defeat ETH!

It is worth noting that it does not have to be decentralized, because our ICP goal is to link WEB2/WEB3, so we can use DFINITY's professional programming to create AI applications suitable for users' habits and attract people from the coin circle!

Traffic can solve the problem of ICP not being noticed, and right now the only thing that can get traffic is AI.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2023-06-04 02:44:44 UTC | #25

Agreed that AI applications (esp. generative AI related) on blockchain will be a game changer. For example, I read an interesting [article](https://www.coinbase.com/institutional/research-insights/research/market-intelligence/at-the-intersection-of-ai-and-crypto) by Coinbase that talked about the growing need for media provenance in an era where AI-generated content looks so real.

This is not news, but the amount of developer interest in AI is at an all-time high right now.

It could work like some kind of forum also, but with an ability to create a team, assign tasks and start working right away. Maybe with some kind of project pages, fundraising and decentralization built in.

The Internet Computer ecosystem would benefit from a website builder platform similar to Wix, Weebly or Duda. This visual drag-and-drop builder would allow users to easily create websites without needing to code.

The platform could also have an extension marketplace where developers can build add-ons for additional functionality. Some extensions could be premium, allowing developers to charge recurring monthly or yearly fees. Over time, this website builder could grow to fully replace solutions like WordPress and Shopify.

To sustain websites that run out of cycles, the platform could incorporate a donation system so users can contribute cycles to keep sites active.

There is also an opportunity to build tools tailored for gaming communities, as Enjin's site builder ceased operations. This could be achieved within the same website builder through extensions like forums, calendars, raid organizers, recruitment, etc.

Overall, an easy-to-use visual website builder with an extensible architecture would fill a need in the ICP ecosystem for non-technical users to build robust online presences. It could become a leading alternative to incumbent solutions.

Essentially let's build our all of the infrastructure that other blockchain ecosystems already need but use centralized clouds to achieve, for example:

1. Graph Protocol Indexers
2. Roll-up sequencers
3. Bitcoin mining pool
4. Bitcoin Lightning Node
5. EigenLayer AVSs
6. Data availability layers for rollups
7. Improved fraud proof execution to reduce optimistic rollup challenge-periods

[Web3Disk.app](https://Web3Disk.app)
Ultra private, fully owned storage


Nearing alpha. Dev is slow lately. If anyone is interested, please dm.

-Focus on full ownership, privacy and security
-Create and fully own in seconds using your II

-Free to use, open source, build yourself
-Web3Disk Service for spawning canisters through easy UI (earn model: charge for full storage capacity)

-Fork of Dfinity's asset canister
-Canister serves its own frontend for single canister solution
-E2E encrypted with vetKeys
-Stable storage

-Ownership is responsibility: users manage cycles through frontend
-Only your II and optionally your NNS are controllers of the canister (for users, devs can add any principal)


**Arguably the most 'secure while convenient' online storage on earth, thnx to vetKeys!**

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-12-07 00:08:04 UTC | #37

This sounds like a MAJOR growth hack. @lastmjs how do you flag this idea to the growth team at Dfinity? @lomesh ?

-------------------------

Samer | 2023-12-16 00:55:48 UTC | #38

Lets get crazy

How about a WASM runtime running inside a canister so we can have something like CanisterOS?

A canister with CanisterOS could have terminal and could install small wasm blobs and run them. Like miniDapps from dappstore

Also possible as networks of canisters without wasm runtime, but slower.

I personally would use such a thing. I feel confortable having some of my stuff secured in a canister which I can acces through onboard frontend and my II

That was part of the motivation for Web3Disk, see above

I also believe that a key part of sovereign ownership on IC is related to how devs can hand over ownership of canisters to user II and NNS through frontend only.

Hey Schindler. I'm new here (apologies in advance if I'm in the wrong forum category) I'm currently developing a game (web2 with web3 integrations and assets). I was reading about ICP and the eco-system falls in line with my game structure. I also read that it is possible to migrate a web2 website | game into the ICP eco-system. As I'm nearing development I'm thinking 'lets go with ICP'. Any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks in advance! :smiley:

dApp idea here- and pardon my lack of understanding if what I am about to propose makes no sense.

For background: I work as a senior AE at a F100 company in the US who is also on the hiring committee (for the sales team)

The biggest issue we are facing right now is candidates lying on their resumes. This is a tale as old as time, but has skyrocketed in recent years. If you aren't on hiring committees you may think "well, just check their references and see if they checkout." Sadly, this cannot work in this day and age. If you're unaware, when reference checking for resumes, any *public* company worth roughly >~$10 billion can only confirm the start and end date of the employees prior jobs. The HR cannot verify if the candidate truly made president's club, or actually increased revenue 30% YoY, or actually did anything they claim to have done! 

This seems like a slam dunk for where enterprises would want to be involved. The costliest thing for any large organization is the hiring and training for an employee that either doesn't work out, or turns out was lying and is highly inept.

Once again, no clue if this is a good idea or not but thought I would share. Thanks!

A platform that allows people to create Challenges that can be solved by implementing Solution in a canister.  At the most basic level, winning solution will be awarded a bounty and participants other than the winner will receive tokens of appreciation for their participation.  A Challenge will include verify and acceptance tests to verify and accept submission.

I've been saying this for a while. Build it on Figma. Add it as an extension. Figma is such a complex product to build that sold for $20B. This would A leverage a tool that is already there and B onboard all the designers in that ecosystem. The extension can publish to a canister and then others can even further add functionally to mirror Shopify. Eventually when it has enough capital it can build it's own tool in rust and deploy to Wasm. I think Figma uses C++. Anyway would be a great thing to demonstrate with a bit of work.

-------------------------

Mattyjay427 | 2024-05-10 18:12:54 UTC | #55

Not sure if this is even reasonable but‚Ä¶.


What if there could be user owned canister LLMs that, as a user, you could choose to give access to all of your text messages/social media/ etc. for the LLM to be ‚Äúyourself‚Äù, kind of like a 1 of 1 NFT. Then there‚Äôs a dating marketplace where each users AI NFTs can communicate with one another and then recommend whether you and someone else would be a positive match?

It would take away the ‚Äúall that matters is looks‚Äù dating apps, and actually be a huge step up from the Hinge‚Äôs of the world where they do their best to cater to personality.

Once again, not a dev and have no clue if this could work or makes sense. But if it could work, it would disrupt the dating app marketplace

I would like to suggest a kind of web browser that synchronizes a server and devices.

Scenario 1. Let's assume a PC and mobile phone. You are starting to write a blog post using your phone. Since the mobile environment is inconvenient(small display, difficult typing), you would like to keep the writing on your PC. Your blog, unfortunately, does not provide automatic saving. So you should copy the post you wrote on and send it somewhere such as your email. Now, you open the both mail and blog site on your PC, paste the copied post into the blog, and then resume writing. What a terrible experience!

Scenario 2. Now there are two devices(PC, phone) and a server. The new web browser synchronizes the server and devices. When you open the browser on your PC, there is the blog tap with a post you were writing. You can keep writing on your PC without copy and paste.

Generally, there is a server and devices. The server interacts with the web. And the server communicates and synchronizes with your devices(pc and mobile): WEB ‚áî SERVER ‚áî DEVICES

Think of dynamic web pages. The browser has to show a PC-specific page on a PC, and a mobile page on a phone.

You can run your own server or use a cloud service like ICP. And the web site could be a Web App.

I‚Äôm not sure if it is possible; I am not a programming expert. I know that unstable server or internet connection degrades the user experience. But I love seamless experiences that allow me to continue working on multiple devices, like Google Docs.

I really like the Endorphin OS idea(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/endorphin-mobile-os-community-consideration/6160?u=murphy), and I'd be happy if it came to fruition based on a browser like this.

I've found the Cloud Browser, here: https://www.w3.org/TR/cloud-browser-arch/
So, it seems you can make a trustless cloud browser service using IC.

An ICPos (ICP operating system) native app on Android and Apple devices. 
The app will have a ICP ecosystem dapps marketplace and dapps can be added as favorites to the app home page. The app will also include wallet feature for creating wallets, transferring/minting tokens, nft explorer/minter, keeping track of token balances.
Everything authenticated through Internet Identity.

wordpress but each module is separated app - this is possible because we have one auth model for all apps, so no need to integrate widgets into one database (like on wordpress) because we have distributed database with distributed access control.
