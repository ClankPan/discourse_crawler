​​Hello! We are the Incheon Universe project team, excited to share our latest updates and progress with you all.

# Brief introduction

* Introducing "Incheon Universe," a groundbreaking blockchain-based urban management platform rooted in the vibrant city of Incheon, the second-largest city in South Korea. Supported by the Incheon government, this project extends its invitation globally, fostering a shared sense of citizenship through NFT-based digital civic rights. Whether residents or individuals abroad, citizens actively contribute to and shape Incheon's growth.
* Facilitating seamless participation, the platform empowers citizens to voice opinions on policies related to the environment, safety, and education, utilizing DAO for decentralized decision-making. Incheon Universe ensures decentralized ownership of participation data, allowing citizens to control and benefit from blockchain technology's advantages.

# The progress so far

We've integrated ICP login into our existing service previously operating solely on the Klaytn blockchain. Additionally, we've added functionality to merge assets like NFTs into ICP. Our DAO feature now allows citizens to freely voice opinions and propose operational ideas for city projects. We've also developed an "idea discussion DAO" where budgeted projects can solicit ideas from citizens. All participation and contributions are rewarded in experience points (XP).

# Roadmap

* Our goal is to establish Incheon Universe as a benchmark for blockchain-based urban management platforms, promoting citizen participation, transparency, and sustainable development. We look forward to contributing significantly to the intersection of technology and civic engagement.
* We plan to open a shop on our platform that utilizes experience points (XP), which serves as a token based on ICP. Additionally, we aim to collaborate within the ecosystem by establishing partnerships with other projects on ICP. The goal is to make experience points usable not only on our platform but also across various projects. Specifically, we aim to collaborate with projects related to aviation, tourism, and environmental technology in Incheon, a hub for aviation and tourism in Korea. This collaboration seeks to activate the burning of experience points within our ecosystem.
