Hello everyone! I'm not sure if you guys encountered an "unexpected error" when running the following code to get the REQUEST_ID for the domain name set up. It worked awhile ago but currently it is not working. Is it really like that? Thank you! 

**CURL Line**
```
curl -sLv -X POST \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	https://icp0.io/registrations \
	--data @- <<EOF
{
	"name": "CUSTOM_DOMAIN"
}
EOF
```
**Result**
```

Just to be sure, you are not providing `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` as domain name as in your above snippet but, your effective domain right?

```
curl -sLv -X POST \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	https://icp0.io/registrations \
	--data @- <<EOF
{
	"name": "CUSTOM_DOMAIN" // <---- here
}
EOF
```

Nvm my last question, it seems we are able to reproduce it. Team will have a look.

Hi @dindog18 

we found the issue and are working on resolving it. We will let you know once it is working again! Sorry for the inconvenience!

As a temporary workaround, you can target one specific node that is working:
```
curl -sLv -X POST \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --resolve icp0.io:443:2604:1380:45e1:a603:5000:cfff:feaf:ee86 \
        https://icp0.io/registrations \
        --data @- <<EOF
{
        "name": "CUSTOM_DOMAIN"
}
EOF
```
