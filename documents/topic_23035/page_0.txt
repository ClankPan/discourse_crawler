How to disable ICRC1 minting account?

If I specify `aaaaa-aa` as the minting account, will it do what I want?

Yes, using the management canister for a minting account makes it so that nobody can use it. But you have to turn it into an account first (instead of using the principal): `dfx ledger account-id --of-principal aaaaa-aa`
