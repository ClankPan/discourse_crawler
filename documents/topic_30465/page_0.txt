## **About Amplify**

Amplify is a Social-Fi platform on ICP that enables projects and creators to boost engagement on their social media posts by rewarding interacting users with $ICP and select ICRC tokens. Version 1.0 currently amplifies X posts (Tweets), with plans to expand into additional Web2 and Web3 social media apps in future versions.


## **How Amplify works**

An Amplify campaign follows a simple sequence of events: 
**Step 01:** Creator creates a campaign by filling out a form, and paying sets of rewards ($ICP or select ICRC tokens)  and a minor platform fee 
 **Step 02:** Users log in to Amplify and participate in the ongoing campaigns (automatic interaction from Amplify UI) 
**Step 03:** Campaign ends & winner(s) are picked by on-chain raffle (if participants > winners set for the campaign) 
**Step 04:** Winning user(s) claim their $ICP or ICRC token rewards, which are credited directly to their wallets.  

At the end of a campaign life cycle:
* The creator/project gains engagement on their post and reaches the right target audience (ICP users).
* Users/participants can earn rewards for engaging in and winning campaigns.

## **How Amplify is built**

Here's a detailed breakdown of the technologies involved:

ICP Smart Contracts: The smart contracts are written in Rust
ICRC2 Token Standard: Amplify supports the ICRC2 token standard for secure and efficient token transactions.

**Frontend:**

TypeScript: Provides static type-checking, improving code quality.
React: Enables a dynamic and responsive user interface.
TailwindCSS: Assists in quickly styling components with a utility-first CSS framework.
Vite: Bundles and builds the Frontend with fast performance.

**Backend:**

TypeScript: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.
PostgreSQL: A reliable relational database for data storage and management.
Node.js: Provides a JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting.
Adonis.js Framework: A robust backend framework to handle complex business logic.
Twitter API v2.0: Integrates features for Interacting with Twitter (X) directly from the Amplify platform.

**Highlights:**

Secure Architecture: Ensures robust protection for data and transactions.
User-Friendly Design: Simplifies user interaction by minimizing complexity.
Scalability: We can easily integrate other social media Platforms (Web2 and Web3) and scale up.

**How Amplify Uses Random Number Generation (RNG) on ICP**

Consensus-Driven Randomness: The Internet Computer uses its consensus mechanism to produce random numbers that are unpredictable and verifiably fair. The randomness is derived from a process involving many nodes, making it tamper-resistant and decentralized, thus creating a fair raffle system in picking campaign winners.

## **Monetization**

By leveraging a nominal up-front platform fee of approximately $5 (paid in $ICP) for Amplify Tweet campaigns, we ensure a steady revenue stream. This not only serves as an income source but also acts as a safeguard against bot-generated clutter. With a steadily increasing user base and growing platform volume, we are confident in our ability to cover ongoing maintenance costs and minor upgrades. 

## **Status of the project**

We have completed development and the v1.0 will go live after the final demo with DFinity.

## **Future Plans**

We plan to integrate Web3 social media applications, providing an excellent opportunity for scaling up. Amplify can significantly enhance engagement on many native ICP SocialFi DApps like Taggr, while simultaneously boosting on-chain activity.
