Please make an announcement as soon as possible because it is not clear what Foundation wants to do through SNS-1 airdrop.

* Will SNS-1 be the governing token for SNS?
* Will SNS governance be a specification independent of NNS?
* If SNS-1 is going to perform a substitute function for what NNS governance can do and take it as a reward, won't that take away from NNS rewards?
* Is it true that there are rumors that SNS-1 is SBT?

These are some of the questions I have.
 I think we all are confused and need to clarify the reason and purpose of airdrop.

Hi @hokosugi 

Apologies for not posting something on the forum to date. 

The best way to describe the purpose of SNS-1 is to describe it as a "dress rehearsal" for everyone to follow along with how a SNS is launched. It will, once launched, be a real SNS and we expect it to live on as an experimental SNS, an SNS which explores the boundaries of what an SNS can become.

The airdrop specifically was done to help decentralize the ownership of SNS-1 by bringing in existing communities from DSCVR, OpenChat and distrikt into the governance of SNS-1.

We will shortly be initializing SNS-1 on the SNS subnet and continuing the process of launching an SNS with a decentralization sale for SNS-1.

Thank you for reply.
> The airdrop specifically was done to help decentralize the ownership of SNS-1 by bringing in existing communities from DSCVR, OpenChat and distrikt into the governance of SNS-1.

As I understand it, the first group of SNS is SNS-1, in which Distrikt, DSCVR, and openchat are the main participants. This SNS-1 will form Dao, and SNS-1 Dao tokens will be issued in addition to tokens for each team like a chat token. That will be the airdrop for this time. Is this correct? Will SNS-2 Dao tokens be issued as the number of SNS-2 and 3 increases in the future?
I understand that this airdrop is a combination of "dress rehearsal", "fun" and "education".  But what does the SNS-1 Dao token do as to governance?Is this correct? Will SNS-2 Dao tokens be issued as the number of SNS-2 and 3 increases in the future?

There is no correlation between SNS-1 tokens and distrikt tokens. This is a completely separate and independent initiative from Dfinity and does not influence or condition distrikt’s future tokenization efforts.

robert_t | 2022-11-16 13:54:46 UTC | #6

I would also go as far as to say that thinking ahead and assuming that any future SNS implementations will be called "SNS-nn" is wrong. Each SNS will be it's own DAO and dfinity just decided to call their initial live test SNS "SNS-1"... they could just have easily given it any name.

Then they had the idea of dropping some governance tokens for this SNS only to selected members from each of the three projects that were mentioned. That's the only link. There's no other link between this SNS-1 test SNS and any other SNS implementation that may come in the future other than that they can probably learn from the way this one turns out! 

I'm sure dfinity will tell us in time what we can then do with the airdropped tokens on SNS-1...

And no, this is not the case. Speaking for distrikt, we are not "participants". Dfinity just thought it'd be nice to airdrop some of their SNS-1 tokens to users from our projects. Nothing more.

FranHefner | 2022-11-16 14:23:33 UTC | #9

Something that confused people (also me to be honest) is that in the case of meeting the distrikt conditions, you don't know where you can see the AIRDROP, since it has nothing to do with distrikt (Dashboard NFT) , you just added your Principal ID, and in the NNS there is no menu to show the airdrop

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-16 14:47:48 UTC | #10

Me too, trying to figure it out. Did it from OpenChat (through a Bot)
..

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2022-11-16 21:07:40 UTC | #11

Thank you all.
I just wanted to confirm.
* No connection to DSCVR, distrikt and openchat token issuance.
* NNS controls the SNS directly as it was designed before.(no new middle layer which this airdrop token can control)
* The role of airdrop this time is unpublished, but mainly memorial and test.
* If airdrop is SBT, it cannot be resold.
* Similar to motoko NFT in positioning .(but not resalable)
* Airdrop may have some role in the future.

I am not wrong about these things, am I?

"some governance tokens" is TEST governance tokens, right?
This confused me because I thought Dfinity would create a new middle layer for governance something between NNS and SNS.

If your comment is directed at me, thank you.

If SNS-1 is a governance token, then my question is what would the SNS-1 token govern? Somewhere there will be a proposal or vote. Where is that? If it is "TEST", I can understand.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-16 21:39:29 UTC | #15

There will be many SNS DAOs e.g for OpenChat. There will be an example DAO that has been named "SNS-1" that will go through the full SNS decentralization including a token sale, and that is doing an airdrop.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-11-17 01:53:13 UTC | #16

Is it fair to say the SNS-1 token is a meme token that doesn't do anything? 

Can you guys at least give it a basic website so the community can play with it? So the DAO controls a blank website. And then people can vote to change its color. Or add text. Or whatever. Just so we get used to governance in the context of a dApp. Today we only know the NNS and being able to actually vote on things that are visually apparent could be helpful.

Thanks for the details.

Will this information be disseminated or shared via twitter or other means?

As for the Forum, I think it is mainly seen by engineers and not by many IC users. If you have not yet done so, I would like to ask you to make an announcement somewhere about the purpose of SNS-1.

Also, in the future, when there is a big action like this one that involves users, I would like you to hold an AMA or something similar.

I think this will create a sense of unity with the users and allow for better progress.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-17 06:00:10 UTC | #18

It was shared on distrikt, DSCVR, and OpenChat. I believe because the airdrop target those active in the ICP community, who are usually found supporting these IC projects. There were also some Twitter posts.

I do not know enough about NFT trading to comment on that. But in principle, this sounds correct.

I would be surprised if it had some role besides being a collectible.

Why people get so entitled when they are given FREE airdrops is something I've never really got my head around

-------------------------

blockpunk | 2022-11-17 11:21:31 UTC | #23

I think SNS-1's airdrop means does not make sense, why should users fill in the principal ID of nns themselves instead of airdropping directly to each dapp's account.

According to DFINITY, II assign a principal ID to each dapp to protect the user's privacy, but now SNS-1's airdrop requires the collection of the user's NNS principal ID, and when the airdrop is sent out and the user makes a transfer, isn't the relationship between the principal IDs of the dapps exposed?

Is the future operation of more SNSs consistent with the demo we saw earlier? If so, the privacy of multiple principal IDs derived from II loses its meaning and instead makes it more difficult for users to use (for using SNS token, users need to copy and paste principal IDs between different dapps and transfer them to each other, which is a really bad experience).

I hope DFINITY SNS team will consider the design of the product level again.

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-11-17 12:01:55 UTC | #24

I personally agree on most points here. I wasn't involved in the airdrop at all; I'm just trying to relay all the messages. I'll try to get the feedback to the right people

-------------------------

Astrapolis-peasant | 2022-11-17 14:00:07 UTC | #25

makes total sense here. The point of having Internet Identity is to separate each principal ID to preserve the user's privacy. Now airdrop requires users to input their neuron's principal id. Having separate principals of different DApps is now meaningless but painful for the end users

-------------------------

passio | 2022-11-17 18:05:42 UTC | #26

It makes me sick how mainly the bot community is rewarded on dscvr... It's only full full bot... Dscvr, Distrikt... We're waiting for virtual people party.

-------------------------

timo | 2022-11-17 19:03:17 UTC | #27

You gained a right to something in one ecosystem, either dscvr, distrikt or openchat, and then want to make use of that right somewhere else, in your nns wallet. Think what would happen if dscvr wanted to give you 1 ICP. It would have to ask you for you wallet address or principal and send it there, creating a link visible to everyone on the ICP ledger. The same is happening here. It is a transfer and as such it is necessarily linking sender and receiver. That's unavoidable.

To be precise, it is unavoidable short of cryptographic tricks such as blind signatures which may even become available on the IC some day. For example, if the threshold ECDSA feature was expanded to threshold Schnorr or threshold BLS then these things may become possible. But currently they aren't.

-------------------------

neeboo | 2022-11-17 20:17:49 UTC | #28

Privacy protection is the EFFECT, not the PURPOSE. The only reason of assigning different principal ids is SECURITY concern. 

If not, delegation identity can be misused and things will go wild.
