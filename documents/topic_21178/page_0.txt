My $5000 grant was chosen. I did send a milestones form. My milestones form was replied:

the current milestones you provided are not detailed enough. Please make sure you include what exactly you are going to deliver for NacDB (or are you completely done already?) and what functions exactly you are going to test.

Now I have two buttons at Submittable:

[ Reply ] [ View Submission ]

Should I submit updated milestones through Reply button? (in a freeform format?)

Hi Victor,

I've opened the milestone form for you again. You should be able to edit/update it.

It is sufficient to ask your questions related to the grants operations via the grants email. This is not a topic suitable for the public forum.
