How do you provide a `Principal` to `dfx` for a call?

e.g.

```
dfx canister call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai knownBucket '("qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai")'
```

for given Motoko function:

```
public shared func knownBucket(bucketId: Principal) : async (Bool) {
```

ends in a serialization error:

> Error: Failed to create argument blob.
Caused by: Failed to create argument blob.
  Invalid data: Unable to serialize Candid values: type mismatch: "qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai" cannot be of type principal

Absolutely makes sense and of course, I will modify my function to use a text argument but, curious to know if possible.

It looks like this ([Source](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/candid-ref#type-principal), see "Textual syntax"):

```
dfx canister call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai knownBucket '(principal "qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai")'
```
