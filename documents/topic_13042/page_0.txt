Recently, our team discovered some improper contents under Dfinity official forum post. Therefore, as one of many start up projects on IC, we condemn such harmful behavior and its consequences for breaking the balance of ic ecosystem, such differentiation would let to many hard working projects feeling discouraged and contempt.


In the identity & authentication section, the Dfinity official purposely displayed Plug and ICNS and made it looks like it’s the only wallet and domain name service on IC. But in fact, IC Naming was the first project to create .ICP suffix. Our testnet has launched since last December with open sourced code since day 1. Plug and ICNS are only a small part of IC ecosystem. Many other great projects on IC don’t have the privilege to be seen so easily. (i.e. **Ratels Wallet, Earth Wallet, Infinity Wallet, ICPBOX, I** **C** **wallet, Stoic Wallet,Astrox me** , the domain name project includes **IC Naming** ). Currently, Dfinity official’s behavior are very damaging for the IC ecosystem and misleading for other users, which undermines the working ethics of other ic developers.

Another thing that’s worth noting is that we found that in the DEX example of the official document, DIP20 was officially listed as the example code. In fact, there are many great community token standards rather than DIP 20 (i.e. DFT, IS20, DRC20 and EXT), but they never gets mentioned. At present, the token standard is still advancing and open for discussion. However, the Dfinity official directly displayed DIP20 as the official example code in the official document, which would probably led the community into false belief that the DIP20 has been selected as the official standard, which is irresponsible to the community.

**Dfinity official actively posted content about Plug and ICNS in the forum, its a serious violation of the core value of decentralization** . Without a fair and healthy competing environment. That would be futile for us developers to work this hard. Because ultimately, all the effort we put in will not be able to compete with the power that Dfinity official has to promote certain project. Moreover, If Plug wallet and ICNS can be favored by Dfinity official today. Will there be more similar situations in the future for Dao, NFT and gamefi? On the other hand, what Dfinity official are doing right now it’s also misleading for users, because they will greatly affected by official’s behavior and lost their interests to find other higher quality projects in the community. As such, we would wonder if that’s the case, will there be a future for an ecosystem that has lost the core value of decentralization, such as fair competition and transparency?

Therefore, in the consideration of maintaining a positive environment and promoting a fair competition in the IC ecosystem:

**1. We hope that the official will recognize and correct this mistake, avoid doing things that displays Dfinity official’s subjective value and tendency for any projects.**

**2. We hope that the Dfinity official will make more efforts to establish an open and transparent ecosystem that carry the core value of decentralization.**

Agree with you somehow, but it seems that the development of IC naming is very slow? From the day I registered, I even cannot open the website for a long time? You may need to speed up the development?

I am NOT  a dfinity employee. However this is a public forum. It is entirely appropriate for dfinity employees to post their personal opinions and biases on the forums.

 In certain cases, the dfinity employees do make disclaimers that their views are their own. In certain cases, an employee(mostly it is @diegop , i think) who does represent Dfinity foundations view.

From your description so far, it seems like a innocuous review of certain wallet / certain naming service/ standards. Can you please provide specific example of the post ( & the context) that you are refering to?

2nd whiny post in 10 minutes. this has to be a record. 

tl;dr:

dfinity publishes an example

50% of the people - reeeeee! not that position! i want my useless service advertised, not the other one!

> This is an adaptation of a [Medium article](https://medium.com/plugwallet/internet-computer-ids-101-669b192a2ace) written by the folks at [Plug wallet](https://plugwallet.ooo/).

This is the 2nd line of the first article. To me it reads like an intro to core concepts on the IC, like principals, accountIDs, the difference between them, and what each choice enables and avoids.

The second is a *sample*, advertised as such, and as far as I can see it integrates ICP with a mock tocken based on DIP20. What exactly is the complaint here?

"Damned if you do, damned if you don't" comes to mind.

Having gone through the links provided, this is NOT a dfinity issue. They are linking some content and some samples. Again i am NOT a dfinity employee. 

@Tyler Have you tried to approach Dfinity with alternate content? They are fairly approachable and reasonable. I am sure that they would take reasonable suggestions, reasonably. They are also struggling with time as they solve and implement some of the very tough problems in crypto.

Why don't we (@Tyler  and i) come back with some reasonable content with competing products and see if they would put it on the sdk page? We can shoot for the content in 7 days and submit to @diegop ?

ais | 2022-05-17 17:01:49 UTC | #11

Hi @Tyler (and all!)

First, we just want to say thanks so much for the comments. They are much appreciated, and we're really happy that people are paying attention to the new docs :)

We totally agree that it's super important to have an open and transparent system, to promote a diverse set of community members, and to work towards decentralization together.
The dev portal revamp is a first step to engaging more community members. We really made a conscious effort to move in the direction of documenting the IC with developers and community in mind. Adding various reference to other projects/proposals (other than DFINITY) was a first step to invite other active contributors and community members to add to the portal. We are opening the portal repo for public contributions, and we'd be more than happy to see edits, additions, or suggestions from whoever is willing to give them!

Clearly we need more inputs and showcasing. The portal is still very much a work in progress, we're still building it out, and I mean it when I say that these feedbacks are appreciated - it gives us direction for where we should build out more, to create a place for you and the rest of the community to contribute, and to form a hub where we can all grow together.

Our first thought as a response here was to say "create a PR, or create an Issue in the repo", but immediately comes the question of how contributions, suggestions, and pull requests would be managed. Saying 'make a PR' does not addess the fact that we don't yet have a systematic way to judge PRs - is replacing one standard for another a good addition to the docs? Likely not. But is creating an addition sample, or page for another standard overall better? Likely so.

Perhaps this is exactly that moment where we need to bring folks together to discuss a good ecosystem-promoting strategy for the docs. What do you think? As always, we're open to suggestion!

-------------------------

[/quote]

I work closely with @ais and the question of how to balance the competing needs of *having docs which are user-friendly* AND *promote the ecosystem*  often rear its ugly head.

Let me lay down some things we believe:

1. We believe docs should help users and promote ecosystem (indeed, see how the IC wiki mentions multiple providers whenever possible: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Tutorials_for_acquiring,_managing,_and_staking_ICP)

2. We believe people should feel free to make PRs to the docs (we also believe we have NOT communicated this properly).

3. We believe that having a PR that replaces all mentions of "plug" with another wallet in a zero-sum way is NOT what we want to see.

Lastly...

4. We believe that we need the community to create good documentation standards for judging PRs and evolving docs further.

## @ais and my proposal

We propose we discuss async in the forum, but also organize 1-2 synchronous sessions on zoom with different wallet leaders. The goal would be to settle on some patterns in the docs for non-zero-sum promotion of dapps (Identity and wallets is just one example, we will see similar things with DEXs and others). @ais and I believe strongly that we need to work with community at the next iteration of patterns for the docs.

If interested, please DM me, but i will be creating a new post soon and reaching out to folks

I should explain here the intent:

1. Intent was to create a community page with many options
2. In the meantime, we just posted one link (with more to come so we can spread the love and promote many players)
3. This community page has been "almost ready" for weeks now but keeps being priority 2 under many things.
4. Today, we decided to cut our losses and will remove the link entirely so we do not give false impression

[/quote]

@Tyler honest question: I am curious why no one just thought of emailing, DMing me or even just saying "hey folks, what about X?" Was your belief that we would only listen if it's a strongly-worded long post on dev forum?

If the answer is...

a. "*We did message you all, and no one listened!*" 
b. "*We did not think anybody would listen without kicking some sand*" 
c.  "*We notice only people who create such long threads get attention*"
d. "*Honestly I was too upset to do anything else*"
e. Something else?

...then I want to know that. I can accept any option, I just want to know how to iterate.

To be clear: I am NOT saying you did anything wrong... **you would be doing me a solid if** you could explain your rationale so we can improve the tenor and tone of dialogue? 

I assume that *we (DFINITY) made you feel you needed to write a formally written complaint*.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-17 18:33:49 UTC | #15

I don't know that it is Dfinity's role to spotlight anyone in particular. In fact, the more the ecosystem can provide for this, the more decentralized it will be... maybe one path would be to present a new open source tech news feed Dfinity could "endorse" to get things going, this way they can focus on their work and "we can on ours". Maybe one geared towards the typical user experience, as opposed to developer focused as this forum is.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-17 18:41:48 UTC | #16

Allow me to explain some of the intent (which I **do not want to pretend we have full mastery of**.... we are still navigating through the nuance @inviscidpixels):

The docs in questions are meant to be helpful and practical for people. So sometimes it is practical to give users concrete examples, such as when users want to know "*How do I store an NFT?*" the answer may be: 

"*Here is a list of known wallets that can hold NFTs...*"

Indeed, that is what we do in the wiki: https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/ICP_custody_options

Same thing when people ask:

* Where are the people discussing developer related questions? (links to discord, dev forum, etc... not run by DFINITY)
* Where are some explorers I can see?

This is further combined with the idea that DFINITY does want to promote its players (in a fair way) as much as it can to help them get traction and to signal to users places where their problems may be answered.

-------------------------

LevenSton | 2022-05-18 04:05:24 UTC | #17

Absolutely agree. 
In addition, I want to say one thing. 
The organization Psychedelic has developed everything in IC ecosystem.
Psychedelic have so many projects(Plug/Dank/Cap/dab/ICNS/Jelly/sonic/sly/metasport-ball),include wallet/Defi/protocol/infrastructure/game and so on.
Do they have enough energy to do every product well? 
And now some products are directly displayed in the official documents, so what about other projects?
Web3 need more open, and need cooperation.

-------------------------

witter | 2022-05-18 04:15:08 UTC | #18

I have been working on the promotion and development of the token standard (https://github.com/Deland-Labs/fungible-token-standard) for a long time, but I am disappointed that the official Dfinity team only shows DIP20 on the official documentation. Maybe Psychedelic was made by Dfinity officials themselves?

-------------------------

anonymous | 2022-05-18 04:33:53 UTC | #19

We need an official standard anyway, otherwise, things going to be so incredibly confusing. There's plenty of token standards on Ethereum, but ERC-20 is the most popular. Can you imagine how confusing that would be if that wasn't established? I'm not saying screw the other token standards, it's just.. confusing.

And disclaimer, I'm not a developer - I'm a user.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-18 06:29:18 UTC | #20

A shout-out to everyone interested in IC token standards:

Please read this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Um3Z2uUgWVyhUvQEjtrSxMG7puTpXRGPT9cvPQ_qroo/edit#heading=h.cknyk7vjrjqx) from the working group and leave your comments! They are listening.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-05-18 07:31:50 UTC | #21

IMO ***Psychedelic does build a lot of open services and they do document them very well***. I would like to see more co-operation and positive-sum games on IC. That being said, DFINITY should also make effort to promote or include other services building on IC. That's why a simple dapp/service catalog might be beneficial.

DFINITY shills = good on-chain reputation = good take-off velocity. DFINITY should also stay away from promoting centralized dapps and projects that are only here to extract tokens from the community, I don't want to name them but it is pretty obvious to most of the developers building on IC

Ultimately the value of the network will depend on builders building cool stuff and the users using them. If we harm the users/builders with monopolistic anti-trust practices we might lose them to a better alternative (can only think of a fork right now)

-------------------------

therealtruth | 2022-05-18 13:50:37 UTC | #24

Nah Psychedelic is just a multi-million fund whose aim is to buy out projects on the IC, quick slapdash job of projects and compete with everyone. Basically monopolise as much of the IC with venture capital money and kill off real projects. 

Well done Dfinity, you have a dip20 token standard that doesn't work that you are promoting.  Plug wallet is very buggy, and so many options. 

Does the foundation understand the word decentralisation?

-------------------------

Tyler | 2022-05-18 14:02:05 UTC | #25

We certainly won't have any problem if Dfinity official just introduce the difference between principals and account IDs, Our concern is due to the power and influence that Dfinity official carries, if users see this article they would probably think plug and ICNS is an officially designated project, which would undermining other projects’ effort and chance to be discovered. 
In addition, DIP20 is just an example, but at the moment it's unfair to only talk about DIP20 and not mention other great token standards. We believe Dfinity official should value their words more carefully, because expressing their own subjective view would probably impact users’ decision.

-------------------------

Tyler | 2022-05-18 14:02:39 UTC | #26

This is indeed some case examples, but solely demonstrate particular project is not unfair to other projects besides plug and ICNS, that's why we are making those comments. Thank you for your proposal, we are actively communicating with dfinity.

-------------------------

Tyler | 2022-05-18 14:04:02 UTC | #27

We are also wondering is there any way we can contact Dfinity and provide feedbacks except the official forum? There are a few things I would like to say about this article.

It is understandable to provide users with specific examples. But it’s not appropriate to demonstrate particular project in the official document. It could have been better if Dfinity official let Plug and ICNS do a demonstration in the forum by themselves. We hope Dfinity official would take fairness into consideration when demonstrate in the official documentation. It would be unfair to the known projects in the wiki, when Dfinity only mention particular project in the official documentation.

I think for some of your answers, there’s some misunderstood, we are not asking any wallet to replace the current mention of the plug. It’s just as official, Dfinity shouldn’t express any subjective value to list particular project in the official document for demonstration and like you said, the documentation needs more links to give users a complete picture of the IC ecology, we agree on that as well.

I'm sure the dfinity folks are friendly and open to discussion, but as an open blockchain ecosystem, would an open and transparent discussion of issues raised by the community be a better way to go?

Just listing a few ideas:
- DM someone from DFINITY on the forum. I'd be happy to implement what I can on my own, or relay to the correct team.
- Write an email to someone. The addresses are not hard to find
- Write someone on Linkedin
- The docs pages have a link at the bottom that says "Edit this page". While the repo is not *quite* yet ready for external contributions, I think you can already raise issues in it and post recommendations what could be changed. This is the one we'd like to see most at the moment
- I'm sure Diego has another good idea to contact someone.

## Update:

Hey folks,

Aisling (@ais) and I have been reading everyone's comments so we are learning and iterating based on folk's feedback:

## Immediate Changes
1. Aisling created a pull request ([https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/170](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/170))  to *remove* the offending copy and I approved the pull request. 

2. From now on, we will try to mention more players or not mention any at all in a much more fair way.


## Giving Feedback
 
[quote]
We are also wondering is there any way we can contact Dfinity and provide feedbacks except the official forum?
[/quote] 

I realize after reading this that I am biased because I am often inundated by DMs across the developer forum or Twitter.

To answer @Tyler 's question (and also show how we will iterate)

1. We envisioned the #1 place for feedback on docs would be the docs Github page and that is why we added the "edit this page" button to every page on the smartcontracts.org. Here is the "edit this page" button and we find very few people select it or submit pull requests, so we will also see how we can make this more prominent.
![Screen Shot 2022-05-18 at 10.47.03 AM|690x335](upload://tbXmh3hlSd5C9J3S9LQP0aBtANM.png)

2. Ways to contact DFINITY about documentation

* The https://github.com/dfinity/portal Github page
* DM myself or @ais on the developer forum
* Write post on the forum (as some such as OP has done)
* Tweet at me (https://twitter.com/mexitlan) or Aisling (https://twitter.com/aisconnolly)

I think that is very good point @Tyler .

In 2020 hindsight, what confused me was less the place and the more the *tenor* of the original post.

It was less a "*Hey folks, I think you may want to change X*" and instead you had a post (while intellectually honest and fair) that calls the documentation work:

* "*improper*"
* "*damaging*"
* "*harmful*"
* "*irresponsible*"

I think your post was honest and fair, but I did wonder, "*Do @ais and I come off as so unapproachable that folks think we need this tenor to listen to their feedback?*"

That is what I want to help change one step at a time, maybe we can get to a point where feedback is as casual as this: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-documentation-should-have-a-feedback-button/12863

Hi Guys, there are still mistakes with this pull request. First it mentions  (e.g. DFT, IS20, DRC20 and EXT) as NFT standards, but most of these are fungible token standards. Second, it gives a DEX example using the dip20 flow, which is far from being a finalised token standard for payment flows on the IC. I think it would be better to remove the DEX example as well, and I believe there is an ongoing discussion with Witter, myself and members of the community about how to improve the ledger standard. Including this example, without examples for the others, really undermines the community's efforts here. 

"NFT standards for the Internet Computer (e.g. DFT, IS20, DRC20 and EXT), but for the purposes of this tutorial we use [DIP-721](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP721). You can see a quick introduction on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/1po3udDADp4)."

-------------------------

Maxfinity | 2022-05-18 19:38:43 UTC | #32

Meant to quote you in the above message ^^ Can we get the following removed? 

"Depositing tokens is more straightforward because DIP20  and other token standards provide a richer interface to interact with.
"

This serves no other purpose than to boost the SEO of dip20 on the IC, and is actually encouraging unsafe code practices. No need to mention dip20 imo, why not just mention the standard Ethereum flow. (which is not suitable for IC development hence why we have notify in the first place). It is not simpler and is detracting from the community's efforts to have a safe payment flow.
