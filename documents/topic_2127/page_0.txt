Looking at the docs above. Step 3 reads:

> Submit the principal to get your wallet canister identifier.

But I'm not sure where to submit my principle :sweat_smile:

-------------------------

lsgunn | 2021-03-09 15:43:43 UTC | #2

Oh that's my bad. We decided not to require this for the current `--network ic`. Your wallet will be created automatically for you inside of each project just like local development. If you have an existing project, you'll need to redeploy to get the wallet.
Previously, we had an intake form for onboarding to the network and that's where you would submit your principal. But that won't be required in the next round of onboarding, so you can skip that Submit the principal step.

Thanks for catching this oversight!

Hazel | 2021-03-09 15:40:44 UTC | #3

Gotcha! I was getting errors when deploying my project to the IC saying I didn't have a wallet canister set. I didn't do the onboarding in the past either :sweat_smile:. Let me see if I can quickly post the error I'm getting.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2021-03-09 15:44:03 UTC | #4

Just kidding, its all working now! Not sure what I was doing wrong. Thank you!

Also, I think the instructions here reflect the reality, but if you see anything amiss, please let me know:

I'm being asked to submit my Principal in the intake form when I try to deploy locally.

It doesn't really give me any more detail than this. When I deploy to the ic network I can get apps to work, but I'm hitting this roadblock at local development and I can't find a way around it.

I'm using the latest version of dfx and my MacOS account is set up as an administrator. Any thoughts on this?

-------------------------

lsgunn | 2021-03-12 15:41:17 UTC | #7

Can you verify your version with dfx —version?
You shouldn’t be seeing that message so it sounds like a bug.

-------------------------

canicodenow | 2021-03-12 15:46:26 UTC | #8

Version is:

dfx 0.6.25

If it helps at all - when I deploy to the ic network, when I first check the wallet canister (i.e. not the front end canister) I need to authorise my Principal. It doesn't mention this step in the guide, so I'm wondering if there's some sort of permissions issue going on.

Thanks

I couldn't reproduce this issue locally. 
Does this happen when you create a brand new project?

This is expected.

Thank you for the detailed reply.

The short answer is: yes. It does happen for a brand new project.

The log for the rest, including dfx deploy is below. This time it has a different error and hasn't mentioned authorising the Principal. I get this error around half the time and the authorise error the other half:

canicodenow | 2021-03-15 12:40:33 UTC | #13

@prithvi have you had any further ideas on this, after my logs? I have a memory error when deploying to the ic-network, which means I can't continue the tutorials until I'm able to deploy locally.

-------------------------

prithvi | 2021-03-15 15:42:07 UTC | #14

Hey @canicodenow, the error you see is
>The request timed out.

and

>The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 400 Bad Request, content type "text/plain; charset=utf-8", content: Failed to connect to host: Connection refused (os error 61)

Indicates you're having networking issues between the replica and dfx. Is this a degradation you see with the latest version & do you see this same issue on older versions?
Do you get a successful result for `dfx ping`

-------------------------

canicodenow | 2021-03-15 15:48:20 UTC | #15

Hey @prithvi, thanks for getting back.

I have only tried 0.6.5 and 0.6.4 - the error happened on both. I haven't tried an older version - is it worth trying (is it possible to install a previous version?).

When I run dfx start, the result of dfx ping is:

     ✘ ✝  ~/ic-projects/actor_hello   master±  dfx ping
    {
      "ic_api_version": "0.14.0"  "impl_hash": "512af2b200fcd01f36354a0449ee108e9d253165f1164510bd7156fee84f339a"  "impl_version": "0.1.0"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 136, 156, 224, 11, 232, 6, 78, 169, 14, 204, 90, 244, 161, 163, 49, 200, 90, 130, 89, 24, 2, 205, 68, 142, 101, 45, 102, 25, 101, 10, 121, 209, 175, 89, 193, 68, 0, 208, 73, 0, 75, 133, 33, 152, 57, 158, 149, 39, 1, 226, 80, 19, 143, 192, 183, 28, 116, 197, 151, 96, 70, 184, 243, 17, 188, 30, 123, 235, 215, 27, 211, 164, 180, 235, 181, 241, 235, 192, 95, 51, 204, 229, 174, 163, 2, 65, 3, 127, 144, 87, 215, 78, 224, 185, 234, 109]
    } 

Which looks ok to me? If I try ping without the server running, there's the same connection error as before, but that's expected I assume as there's no replica running.

Thank you
Matt

prithvi | 2021-03-15 16:09:38 UTC | #16

It's possible to install an older version by doing DFX_VERSION=A.B.C prepended to the install script. Can you try it with 0.6.23, at least we can rule out if this connection error with the replica is a degradation in the new releases or also present on the old one.

-------------------------

canicodenow | 2021-03-15 17:31:51 UTC | #17

Interestingly, it has given an error at a different point using v 0.6.23. It didn't appear to do the 'Creating a canister on the local network' step, then when it got to installing the canisters there was a long delay before the below error appeared.

Error on the dfx start terminal:

Ori | 2021-03-15 17:45:16 UTC | #18

It’s worth running dfx start --clean the first time after changing down a version. See if that helps with v0.6.23 there.

-------------------------

canicodenow | 2021-03-15 19:49:13 UTC | #19

Hi @Ori - the same thing happens on --clean too. In fact I need to use --clean after the error as the server doesn't work again afterwards unless I do.

I'm stumped.
