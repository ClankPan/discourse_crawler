# Governance Technical Working Group

Introducing the Governance Technical Working Group.

## TLDR

* Initial Intent: Discuss and specify proposals to Improve the NNS
* Leadership: @bjoernek @brutoshi @lastmjs
* Voting, Discussing, and Publishing: [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-governance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/g85NxZfZEh)
* First Meeting: September 29 on Zoom, see the [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19jazBncjc5YmtnY29vaWNuMXA4N21vMWVyb0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)

## Initial Intent

The initial intent of this working group is to create a formal space to discuss and specify proposals for enhancing the NNS governance system. The working group itself will choose its own focus and scope within that broader intent.

## Leadership

The working group will be coordinated by @emmaperetti and will initially be led by three individuals representing different groups of time zones:

* @bjoernek for the European time zones
* @brutoshi for the Asian time zones
* @lastmjs for the North American time zones

This is just the initial leadership, the working group can discuss changes in leadership (e.g. rolling changes per quarter).

## Voting, Publishing, and Discussing

We're going to experiment with using GitHub as a place for us to govern the working group itself. [Here is the repository](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-governance). The will of the working group will be represented by documents in the working group, and consensus will be formed with GitHub issues and reactions.

More informal discussions can take place in the dedicated [Discord](https://discord.gg/g85NxZfZEh) or in the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/).

## First Meeting

Our first meeting will be held on September 29 at 3pm UTC (see the [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19jZ29lcTkxN3JwZWFwN3ZzZTNpczFobDMxMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)). The purpose of the first meeting will be to decide the focus of the working group and possibly begin to discuss concrete improvements to the NNS and their importance.

You can make proposals for the focus and scope of the group in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-governance/issues/1). Please come to the first meeting prepared with a GitHub account. Though we are using GitHub, we expect this group to be less technical in nature than the other working groups.

Thank you @lastmjs @bjoernek @brutoshi .

I have posted my thoughts on potential scope of the group on Github as proposed: https://github.com/dfinity/wg-governance/issues/1#issuecomment-1258290153

May I ask what exactly DFINITY intends to do with 49% dead neurons will forever follow the DFINITY vote?

DFINITY intends to do
[/quote]

A neuron (like DFINITY's) has no ability to change do anything to its followers. Only the followers can change this.

You did not ask, but I think periodic confirmation of relationships is healthy and in scope for the working group to discuss.

Side note: I am not quite sure how you define a "dead neuron" nor how 49% was derived, but I believe i answered the main intent to your question.

Dylan | 2022-10-07 01:32:33 UTC | #17

Anyone interested in participating in the working group should fill out this survey.

I filled it out specifying a lot of actual NNS issues that can be discussed, rather than the *meta* level of the first two meetings where most of what was discussed was the working group itself. Hopefully we can move past that soon.

Arthur | 2022-10-10 23:42:28 UTC | #18

I'm not going to be able to attend the next meeting and I don't have more time to give the GWG this week so I've summarised the available information and processed it into a candidate mission statement and list of work items for the group to consider. Given there was a focus on the working group scope I tried to produce a scope document but it wasn't possible in light of the diversity of responses. The mission statement could use defending but it is only intended as a place to start and mission statements always get changed.

The content of the mission statement & work items doc is based on summaries of primary resources for the purpose of brevity and relevance so some stuff was lost in the compression. Also, nothing posted on the Github and no survey submissions after today, or from the Chinese community were included.

**For the next meeting I propose the following resolutions:**

1. All future meetings have an agenda and designated note-taking-person
2. GWG participants break into groups based on work items and return at the next meeting with a scope and research plan for the work item they've chosen.
3. One group gather feedback from the GWG on the candidate mission statement & work items, summarise the responses not included in the documents below, and produce a new candidate mission statement and list of work items.

**My Introduction and Governance Interests**

Hello everyone. This is my very first post on the DFinity forum. I've done my best to find the appropriate place for this post, so please redirect me if I didn't hit the right category and thread.

I am quite interested in contributing and collaborating to improve NNS/SNS governance, so I would like to be a part of this technical working group. I am not a software developer, but I have other technical skill sets. I am currently scoping out an experimental project for my PhD starting next year. One focus of the project would be improving the state of the art with respect to the nascent field of computational social choice. This research could help fill a huge gap in current NNS governance, where prioritizing alternatives, optimizing resource allocations, and incorporating confidence/uncertainty levels are all currently not possible. This is obviously due to the extremely limited information that approval voting can provide (as used in all DAOs), where only one proposal at a time can be considered in isolation, and only a binary "yes" or "no" response is permitted.

**Computational Social Choice as a Path to Address the “Impossible” Prioritization Problem**

At first pass, this sounds like an easy problem to fix. Why can't we just use a different voting method that works consistently well when prioritization is required? Unfortunately, it is not so easy, as nearly 75 years of modern social choice research has shown, along with lively academic debates before then going back to the time of the French Revolution and beyond. Surprisingly, no reliably sound prioritization method currently exists. In fact, a Nobel Prize was awarded to Kenneth Arrow in 1972 for his axiomatic proof in 1950 that a *dictatorship* is essentially the only social welfare function that meets some minimal set of aggregation criteria when >2 alternatives are involved. Normally, the Nobel Prize is awarded for achieving what was previously impossible. However, in Arrow's unique case, it was basically awarded for proving what is shockingly unachievable, per his "Impossibility Theorem".

Although a perfect preference aggregation method may never exist, there are still many ways to improve and optimize how social preferences are aggregated. This is where computational social choice (aka “COMSOC”) comes into play, which combines the independent fields of computer science and social choice. In effect, COMSOC algorithms can objectively aggregate individual priorities into the most consistently rational (non-cyclic) social prioritization that meets as many key aggregation criteria as possible. These criteria, along with the best computational social choice algorithms for ICP governance, could ultimately be approved and implemented by the NNS, assuming pilot prioritization projects prove to be successful.

**How We Could Collaborate on NNS Governance and Why it is Urgent**

I can obviously build these aggregation processes and models on existing cloud infrastructure – and that effort is already well underway – just like I could easily capture individual evaluations using existing survey applications. However, my preferred approach would be to build all of this out more permanently on the Internet Computer (i.e., both the front end capture of individual evaluations and the back end aggregation of those evaluations into a single social preference). The ICP blockchain is where I see this computational social choice functionality being most useful in the longer term given the pressing need for all DAOs to have full prioritization (and resource allocation) capability on the blockchain. Approval voting is simply unfit for this purpose and grossly inadequate.

It is a critical job responsibility of everyone in traditional management today that they be fully capable of prioritizing alternatives with consistent rationality. Yet DAOs have no such critical capability, even though their most important role is to make these managers obsolete. To put this in perspective, just imagine how unacceptably handicapped CEOs would be if they were forced to consider every alternative (or investment allocation) in complete "yes/no" isolation, without any relative prioritization, comparative evaluations, or confidence/uncertainty levels factored into their decision process. That is exactly the type of stripped-down, serial decision making that all DAOs – including the NNS – are currently stuck with. Such a blunt decision-making process should be considered just as unacceptable for DAOs to use as it would be for any CEO running a large organization.

Anyway, I will try to cut short my rambling exhortations on this point for now. If anyone is interested in helping to prototype a more robust evaluation and preference aggregation process on the ICP blockchain, then please let me know. I can handle the design and algorithm parts, but I have no expertise to migrate or build this functionality on the ICP blockchain. In fact, I have no idea if it is even possible on the blockchain yet. Alternatively, if someone is just interested in academic brainstorming or experimental ideation around this DAO governance topic, I would greatly appreciate any feedback or input from others.

Finally, it is remotely possible that I could get some funding for this development effort. However, I can't commit to anything unless the blockchain development is scoped out a bit, which I don't have the expertise to do.

**This Make-or-Break Urgency Applies to the Future Viability of All DAOs**

From both my perspective and DFinity's, governance is truly the "crown jewel" that will ultimately make or break the entire ICP project. It is also what will determine the future viability of all DAOs – running as an SNS or otherwise – since they won't be able to evolve into larger organizations without socially scalable prioritization processes. Getting governance right is truly that important. Therefore, my hope is that others might grasp this monumental urgency too and will want to collaborate on a blockchain-based solution.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-10-25 20:18:24 UTC | #23

@brutoshi, it seems I'm not the only one to make a similar point, copied below from your document:

*Besides Yes/No, NNS should leave room for more varieties of questions, such as multiple choices, or re-ordering/prioritization of certain options (roadmap milestones). (BlockPunk)*

Please see my other post from today related to the urgent need to incorporate prioritization capability into the NNS/SNS decision-making process. There is a compelling academic reason why all DAOs still rely on the grossly inadequate, least-granular method of approval voting for all decisions, which I describe in that post. However, this extremely restrictive method will not be sufficient once DAOs grow beyond a single dictatorial group effectively dominating all prioritization decisions. 

The dirty hidden secret of all DAOs today is that the most important organizational prioritizations and resource allocations are effectively discussed and finalized offline. They are then serially implemented as proposals via a majority coalition or delegated voting control over the DAO. What is especially troubling is that these offline prioritization decisions tend to have the highest strategic impact and involve the greatest risks and complexity. By contrast, isolated, single-issue proposals on-chain tend to be the most routine and involve the least risk and complexity, requiring nothing more than a yes/no approval vote. 

In other words, decentralized organizational power is largely an illusion in today's DAOs. Unfortunately, that illusion cannot scale indefinitely, nor should we really want it to. All of these "democratically-empowered" DAO members will eventually take notice and angrily object once they collectively realize that they have no clothes on, just like the management emperor that they thought they deposed long ago. If we don't have a solution in place before then that is truly empowering democratically, the entire DAO governance process could ultimately implode.

Hi All,

Is there a central place where the time / zoom link is posted for the governance working group?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-10-27 10:17:38 UTC | #27

Hi all, here is a quick summary of short catch-up on the governance working group earlier today

* Admin: We should announce governance working groups sessions a few days in advance in the IC forum and DSCVR/Discord/Twitter.
* Good candidates for the next sessions: Guiding principles/Ethos, NNS treasury, ... 
* Before a meeting in a big round, sub-groups should work out concrete options/proposals. @Arthur & @aiv offered to facilitate a sub-group on guiding principles/Ethos. Please let them know if you would like to join.  
* Once we have a concrete options/proposal for a topic we can schedule the next session of the governance working group.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-27 20:23:42 UTC | #28

This idea occurred to me, I don't know if it could be debated. 
I am not an expert on the subject and excuse me if I mess up due to ignorance, but if we want to increase decentralization and participation in governance, why not widely reward the neuron that proposes a proposal that is finally accepted and implemented by the NNS, those rewards can then be divided evenly by the followers’ ceded voting power (voting power) given to that neuron through liquid democracy. 

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from unassigned ICPs), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance. In addition, since the reward is a fixed amount to be distributed, the neurons with less voting power (for different reasons) would be more attractive to the followers since, in the case of proposing and implementing a proposal, there would be more rewards to be distributed discouraging the accumulation of power and encouraging decentralization. 

Obviously, this at the same time would encourage the active action of the community to look for the right partner periodically, discouraging passive voting and the stagnation of power that leads to apathy and corruption.

for example, before creating a given Governance proposal, a contest of proposals will be held with a certain duration so that the community has time to develop on a certain convenient topic. The winner decided by Nns would upload their proposal to vote to be implemented. if it is implemented then there is a prize. in this way we would squeeze the greatest potential of governance and community intelligence

@Sabr  thoughs?

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-10-27 20:52:45 UTC | #29

@esquivada, I'm not sure if I understand your proposed concept correctly. However, the key problem with almost any fixed incentive system applied to subjective personal contributions is that it can be gamed or manipulated based on the known levers/variables to increase rewards. Incentive systems that are less vulnerable to this risk tend to be too convoluted or complex for participants to understand, which would obviously undermine the core motivational purpose of the incentive. Moreover, some proposals are clearly much more valuable (or impactful) than others with respect to the social welfare of the community, so this subjectivity should be factored into the reward process somehow if the incentives are going to be perceived as fair.

That said, incentives that must always apply equally to everyone, regardless of any subjective personal contribution, can of course be fixed and formulaic. A good example would be the scaled inflation rewards for dissolve and holding periods. Although one could argue that these rewards are suboptimal at any particular point in time and should be tweaked (which the NNS can do), at least they can't be gamed or manipulated by anyone, since subjective personal contributions are never factored in.

Given that DFinity likely initiates (directly or indirectly) a greater proportion of all proposals compared to its ownership percentage of circulating ICP, I'm not sure how rewarding the neuron that makes a successful proposal could help decentralize power. Even if DFinity's followers could share in the success rewards of DFinity's proposals somehow, I see an increase in centralized power as being more likely with this suggestion, as opposed to a decrease. Moreover, in a hypothetically paranoid scenario, if DFinity wanted to manipulate more rewards in its favor, it could simply increase the number of proposals it generates and approves via its coalitional voting power.

Keep in mind that the key problem embedded in your suggestion is how to allocate resources (rewards) to participants based on subjective personal contributions. As a result, the only potentially fair solution that I see working in these scenarios is a voter-driven incentive based on prioritized input data - in other words, cardinal or ordinal preference orderings from each voter as opposed to approval votes. 

Naturally, that brings us back once again to what I called the "prioritization chasm", which we first need to cross to make any collective prioritization process feasible and fair. No organization can ever be meaningfully decentralized until it develops a consistently rational capability to prioritize multiple alternatives without dictators. Using approval voting combined with coalitional voting power to rubber stamp single-issue proposals that stem from prioritizations made by shadow dictators accomplishes almost nothing of substance. That's just decentralization window dressing -- an illusion of participatory control that only makes us feel empowered when we are unable to see the reality.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2022-10-27 21:18:33 UTC | #30

I understand your point.  but if we were able to channel the suggestions of proposals at the objective convenience of the governance through public contests and voting through the nns.  we would solve opportunism.  on the other hand to those rewards can then be divided evenly by the followers’ ceded voting power (voting power) given to that neuron through liquid democracy.

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from unassigned ICPs), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance. In addition, since the reward is a fixed amount to be distributed, the neurons with less voting power (for different reasons) would be more attractive to the followers since, in the case of proposing and implementing a proposal, there would be more rewards to be distributed discouraging the accumulation of power and encouraging decentralization.

@Arthur @aiv I would be interested in participating in this. You are probably not surprised, so I thought I'd offer my help. How can I help?

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-10-27 23:01:36 UTC | #32

@esquivada, the "public contests" among multiple proposals ultimately just pushes the collective prioritization problem back one step before the NNS vote. However, that key problem still remains. 

I have no major issue with your suggestions, including using unassigned ICPs, which I agree might incentivize those token holders to start participating and help with some decentralization. I only have an issue with how collective prioritization could be implemented to make the suggestions work as intended.

I still don't fully understand what you mean by the rewards being "divided evenly by the followers' ceded voting power". If passive neurons continue to follow DFinity blindly, then how could it be that they should receive the proposal success reward? Wouldn't this just increase their incentive not to participate in voting, which could only decentralize power further? Also, are you saying that popular followees (like DFinity) would get either a reduced reward or no reward at all just because others are following them? Keep in mind that any reverse discrimination against DFinity as a followee would have to be imposed upon all neurons, any one of which could also become a followee by someone else's choice.

Perhaps you could provide a simple example to explain the logic. As one possible example, pehapswhere neuron A is following the DFinity neuron ("D"), who follows no one; and neuron B is following neuron C, who is also following no one. How would a reward of 100 ICP for a successful proposal be divided amongst them, and how would this reward depend on who submitted the proposal?

jacquesSinclair | 2022-10-28 00:32:35 UTC | #35

@Sabr why should there be a reward for those who pass a successful proposal?
Wouldn't something like 
[ the proposer must stake X amount of ICP to put forward a proposal, if the proposal is successful then they receive their funds back, if its unsuccessful then the staked ICP gets burned to prevent proposal spam ]
be better?
I mean I guess I can understand rewards as an incentive to promote network development, I'm not really sure how I feel about proposal rewards and don't really see how its necessary.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-10-28 01:58:12 UTC | #36

@jacquesSinclair, that was a suggestion from @esquivada, not me. I don't have an issue with someone making either argument (for or against), but I would not personally support rewards only for successful proposals either. This could promote some group think, where only obvious or very popular proposals get pushed forward instead of taking the risk on a healthy debate or discussion making a controversial proposal more widely supported after being submitted. 

As a better alternative, I would support rewards for community contribution value, as evaluated by the community, since relative contribution/participation value by each community member is necessarily a very subjective assessment. I would also support member reputation scores (in multiple categories) driving voting power instead of ICP voting power, at least for certain proposals related to core values / ethics, technical R&D decisions, etc.

[ the proposer must stake X amount of ICP to put forward a proposal, if the proposal is successful then they receive their funds back, if its unsuccessful then the staked ICP gets burned to prevent proposal spam ]
be better?
I mean I guess I can understand rewards as an incentive to promote network development, I’m not really sure how I feel about proposal rewards and don’t really see how its necessary.
[/quote]

I think I didn't explain myself well.  I want to make it clear that I would not touch the current system of governance.  

In the interests of not increasing inflation with the NNS minting rewards from neurons that have not voted, all the ICP of rejected proposals coming from Spam, opportunism or proposals rejected by the community could go to a pot of rewards for the proposals that are accepted by the community.  
This would not change the current ROI of rewards nor would the NNS increase the inflation from coining "unassigned" ICP from rewards from neurons that have not voted. 

What continue with this?  

on the one hand discouraging absurd or spam proposals and encouraging active participation in convenient smart solutions at any given time, and decentralization on the other.  

Suppose that the pot of ICP minted from the proposals not accepted by the NNS is 1000 ICP at a given time, then conveniently a neuron X finds an improvement or solves a problem, the neurone X proposes to the NNS and its proposal is approved.  
Now suppose that Neuron X has a voting power of 100 ICPs, of which 10 ICPs are from itself and the other 90 ICPs come from 9 other neurons that follow it with 10 ICPs each.  
Those 1000 Reward ICPs from the pot would be assigned to the maturity of all those neurons via Neuron X with a 10% weighting for each of them, that is, 100 ICPs for each one. 
 
what can we expect  with this? 

The extraordinary reward, being amount pre-established by the NNS (from rejected proposals), would encourage not only the appointment of new neurons, but also their active participation in governance. In addition, since the reward is a fixed amount to be distributed, the neurons with less voting power (for different reasons) would be more attractive to the followers since, in the case proposing and implementing a proposal, there would be more rewards to be distributed discouraging the accumulation of power and encouraging decentralization.

Obviously, this at the same time would encourage the active action of the community to look for the right partner periodically, discouraging passive voting and the stagnation of power that leads to apathy and corruption.

for example, before creating a given Governance proposal, a contest of proposals will be held with a certain duration so that the community has time to develop on a certain convenient topic. 
To avoid the opportunistic rush of followers, once the proposal is uploaded by the neuron to the NNS, it will no longer be possible to follow that neuron during the voting process.

The winner decided by Nns would upload their proposal to vote to be implemented. if it is implemented then there is a prize. in this way we would squeeze the greatest potential of governance and community intelligence

Make it clear that those neurons that vote independently following or not a winning neuron of the proposal, will also take their reward +~ predictable by the current tokenomics @Sabr

Fundamentally, I cannot support rewarding only successful proposals, since that would promote not just group think, but an amplified bias towards the status quo, since that bias naturally already exists. That said, I do recognize that spam proposals can create a lot of soft costs that we should try to avoid.

I would prefer to filter out spam proposals with a relatively low bar applied to reputation scores, where everyone could start with a neutral reputation score/weighting of 1.0. Poor reputations (e.g., from a history of spamming the NNS with frivolous proposals, as judged by all neurons) would lower that score or weighting factor below 1.0. Once someone's reputation score gets chopped down to a low enough threshold (say, 0.2), then they would be temporarily ineligible to submit more proposals. A slightly higher score (e.g., just above 0.2), might get their proposals down-weighted or subjected to some intermediary approval process before being voted upon by all neurons. **In any group decision-making process that continues indefinitely, reputation should matter, and it should be tracked.**

Also, I still don't see how this suggestion from @esquivada would promote decentralization. Since DFinity's proposals would always tend to have the highest success rate due to their expertise reputation and coalition voting power, everyone would be even more inclined to blindly follow DFinity to cash in on those success rewards. Moreover, any increase in voting power that they get from success rewards would be matched by DFinity's increase in voting power on those same rewards.

I'm not sure how I feel about a social credit score. It could be a good way of filtering out spam proposals, but I dont know if having more moving parts is good.
I think the raw approach of just burning the 10 icp for the failed proposal is a good enough way to disincentivize spam. 

In another thread I saw someone talking about implementing ranked proposal, where the proposal would go through different levels of maturity [ idea>motion>implementation] and required icp to submit would be in proportion to it. 
All of the spam would settle down at the tier 1 proposals so it would be easily filtered, and it wouldnt disincentivize good proposals from being submitted because of low entry cost

Who's reputation? neuron? an individual can have many neurons.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-01 12:13:49 UTC | #41

@jacquesSinclair, thanks for helping to clarify my thoughts and how to communicate them. I agree that a generalized "social credit score" for a person overall on all contributions would likely not be appropriate. At a minimum, we would obviously need to differentiate proposal reputations from voting reputations. "Social credit score" is also a very loaded concept, with some social banishment complications that we would want to avoid.

As for proposal reputation scores, which could ultimately get so low to temporarily ban proposals from certain individuals (or named neurons), I agree that these may not even be necessary if we can find an easier way to filter out spam or low quality proposals. This is just one additional suggestion to consider.

As for the voting reputation scores that I referred to, which would be separate, these were more in the context of domain-specific areas. They would generally range from a neutral (1.0) level to higher levels. When certain individuals acquire or repeatedly demonstrate clear expertise in certain domains, such as cryptography, their votes should be given higher weight in those domains (per group consensus) vs. others' votes in those same domains.

That said, a more general reputation score might also be appropriate, when the topic is something as broad as deciding on a non-technical matter that is very important to the future of the IC. Someone who is demonstrably committed and has contributed consistently for years towards building this IC future in a positive way should obviously have a higher reputation score than someone who is just along for the ride with short-term investment concerns. Again, this score would be ranging mostly from a neutral (1.0) level to higher reputation levels, rather than be used as a social exclusion score.

On your other topic about implementing staged proposals, I agree 100%, since this is how proposals are most commonly done, via nomination first, then voting. Only after proposals are sufficiently nominated (via positive indication only), either by a minimal number or % of votes, could they then proceed to an actual vote. This alone could be sufficient to eliminate almost all spam and low quality proposals.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-01 12:31:36 UTC | #42

@radudaniel, my suggestion obviously assumes an additional unstated attribute as a condition before calculating any reputation score. Among other possible ideas, one of the following attributes could be required to be eligible to submit a proposal: 1) age or minimum size of neuron, 2) having a named neuron (as @cryptoisgood proposed), or 3) perhaps requiring all proposals be submitted under one's unique Internet Identity without any connection to a neuron. The latter could be appropriate in the long term, given that the Internet Computer is ultimately meant for all of humanity's benefit, not just ICP investors.

Similarly, for voting reputation scores, I think having a named neuron or using one's Internet Identity would be required to build a score above the default 1.0 level. I can't think of a different alternative for now, but perhaps others have some ideas to offer.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-11-01 15:04:28 UTC | #43

The approach to a purely digital ID not linked to the real life one of the person is quite interesting. There are many attributes (as you said) that could be considered, but the issue is that the type of behaviour that could inflict repetitional cost can be avoided can be easily "transferred" to a new ID. 

You can gamify the system to corroborate more such attributes so that in time only based on a certain score derived from each or sum of all, different types of actions are allowed or not, but than it just adds complication over an already gamified system - the token. 

I am not against the idea, in fact I am curious how others think this can be achieved.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-01 17:01:59 UTC | #44

Good points, Radu. There is always some theoretical room for gaming the system when subjectivity is involved by necessity. However, based on DFinity's vision for a unique "proof of personhood" ID (as opposed to a proof of real life ID like a passport), this would not be easy to game. 

"People parties" (with narrow time and location windows) or similar means would be required to validate this personhood. This process would impose some sybil-resistance and personal costs to prevent bots and duplicate IDs. Also, trashing your old unique personhood for a new one could implicitly mean trashing all the good reputations earned (in various domains), your IC history in multiple SNS applications, etc. Similar logic around the high costs of acquiring or trashing an identity could be applied to a named neuron, which requires some reputation history to acquire (see DFinity's recent rejection vote on a named neuron proposal due to that proposal coming from an individual with no forum history or verifiable identity).

Another easy deterrent would be to simply require a minimum amount of IC personhood history (say, 1 month) before being eligible to submit proposals. This is similar to the 10-15 timeout imposed on new members of some DAO forums (i.e., before a new member is allowed to post anything, to help prevent bot spam or duplicate ID spam). 

Clearly, we are just brainstorming here, so I'm not trying to draft any proposal. I am also not very familiar with all the details around the suggested "proof of personhood" process. The devil is always in the details, especially when us crypto humans get our gaming hats on to beat a rigid system!

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-11-02 09:28:38 UTC | #45

I treat a subject like identity from a pattern perspective. In this case a pattern of behaviour unique to an individual/agent that has a very precise scope, to give others agents of the network a "heuristic" to easily evaluate future behaviour based on past behaviour as assessed in a distributed way by many agents in the network. 

For the agent who is in "the possession" of the identity compliance with principles/rules is a matter of cost-benefit mid-long term analize.  

The cost of wrong doing in most forms of organisation is always bigger than benefits (example: a wrong doing might slash 100 reputation points which might take on average 1 year or the equivalent in other form of resources even if by braking the rules the benefit was something equivalent to 10 reputation points) 
Such disproportionate response is used to deter such behaviour which in a complex system will inevitable have unintended consequences thigh might inflict order of magnitude higher costs to the network. 

Yes we can to a lot to stimulate the benefit accumulation, but there is little we can do so the "identity" will not defer the possible cost of a malevolent action through a proxy ID. 

This is why establishing a form of digital ID unlinked to the biological is I think a very interesting challenge similar in nature to how Satoshi established a form of digital "trust"

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-02 15:31:47 UTC | #46

Again, great thoughts, Radu. 

A digital Internet ID should be as enforcedly unique as possible. It can remain optionally anonymous, but unique personhood should be verifiable. Without any such ID, we will never learn to be responsible for what we do online. This is especially important when we are doing adult things, like collectively proposing, debating and voting on the future of humanity's infrastructure for digital communication and productivity. 

The experiment to allow rampantly disposable identities and being irresponsibly anonymous has already run its course. It's the infantile hellscape of Web2's (anti-)social media. On a separate note, this is where Web3 social media could really be a game changer, with unique (but optionally anonymous) Internet IDs and community-driven ownership and moderation.

Hey everyone, I've created a subgroup for formalizing the working group's process. I've created a GitHub issue for this subgroup here: https://github.com/dfinity/wg-governance/issues/7

I've also created a pull request into the repository with my proposed changes here: https://github.com/dfinity/wg-governance/pull/8

@emmaperetti we'll need to allow outsiders to make pull requests, the permissions of the repo don't allow that yet.

If you all could please review my pull request, even though it's closed (we can reopen it later once permissions are fixed), then we can start moving towards a more defined process for the working group.

bjoernek | 2022-11-10 19:52:09 UTC | #52

Hi all,

I just participated in a great session of the governance working group and would like to share my key take-aways:

Discussion on proposal for Ethos

* Many kudos to @aiv & @Arthur for preparing today’s session very well in a preceding sub-group, providing a [concrete write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V659e6eZxWmRBiA-05uOyyisDKcD65JY19hDTXrQR-s/edit) ! This made the meeting very efficient and focused.
* Ethos is meant to provide decision-making principles which should be approved by the NNS.These principles (the interpretation of which may differ) are not enforceable.
* The principles could be used to communicate to new-joiners how the platform intends to evolve.
* There was a discussion on concrete suggestions for these principles, e.g. mutability vs immutability of the tokenomics of the system (with varying opinions in the room).
* We also discussed the trade-offs between formulating soft principles vs concrete tech-based suggestions to the protocol.

My (not DFINITY’s) initial thoughts on this

* I very much like that principles could be used to explain to outsiders how the community ticks and how the NNS/IC could evolve.
* I could imagine that these kinds of principles could also be formulated by known neurons, facilitating the choice of whom to follow. In particular we could also have a competition of contrasting principles. This would also require that we foster a much more active process for choosing known neurons.
* With respect to turning Ethos into a proposal: In my opinion we should try to clarify beforehand what is in scope of being a NNS proposal. I am personally in favor of a narrow scope, where NNS proposals are about concrete changes to the NNS protocol (or at least motion-like intentions on introducing certain features). From that perspective, guiding principles would not be in scope of NNS voting.

Future process of the governance working group

* Kudos to @lastmjs for preparing and presenting this point well!
* It is suggested to follow the following open process.
  * Governance working group meetings are scheduled ad-hoc.
  * Sub-groups review a particular topic and prepare a concrete suggestion.
  * The according lead(s) of a sub-group propose a slot (day & time) for the next governance working group.
  * For documentation sharing, we will experiment with using google docs and github and subgroups will pick what works best for them.

@emmaperetti thank you for organizing and thanks to everyone who attended. This was my first governance working group and I was impressed with everyone’s contributions.

Should I expect the recording to be posted here when it’s ready? I’d like to share with others in the community.

Thanks again!

Not sure I follow, I usually see names of people talking. Do you know what they mean?


> - This is another closed door meeting ( was there a joining button ? )

I didn't join previous but last ones I joined were all open. Did anything change?

I hope the governance and Ethos groups will place transparency on the roadmap. We have just witnessed on a grand scale what happens when organisations are trusted by users and developers while decision making process and financials remain opaque. Let us not forget that the IC is at the moment entirely controlled by a centralised organisation which refuses to release any details of its financials.  There is a tendency, in small groups, to think, well we know these guys, they are all great individuals, they would never do something bad. And regret thinking that way when it is too late. Let us aim to reach a state where trust in a centralised organisation in no longer required. That is the most important marker of the IC's success.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-11-14 10:06:17 UTC | #57

Thank you  for following up @diegop !

To answer your questions
1) Zoom did show as usual the name with whom you signed in Zoom. 
2) The working group meeting was open as usual and advertised on the Forum, Twitter and Discord. Prior to the meeting there was a sub-group dedicated to the topic Ethos, who worked out a proposal and presented this in the meeting. The sub-group called for interested participants on the Forum beforehand.

I meant that the names were visible during the live session. So everybody who participated could see who else was in the call. 

In the Zoom recording, the names are indeed not visible. Maybe we can tweak the settings for the Zoom recording for the next round. Let me check with @emmaperetti.

By chance I stumbled across this article about DAO governance today. I believe it is a good read and provides a lot of food for thought.

https://medium.com/@lawrencelundy/no-such-thing-as-decentralised-governance-2a6c6f97382f

I have skimmed through some docs and summaries of the governance working group and get the impression that a lot of great work is done by this group! Thanks to all for investing their time and energy into this important aspect of the IC and our community.

For me the quoted article is a call to action on a "meta governance" discussion. Which I believe is - long term - extremely important not only for the NNS but for any SNS!

Such a meta governance discussion might not currently be the focus of this working group. Thats why I want to create awareness for it. In the hope it will become part of a long term agenda of this group.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-11-25 03:18:25 UTC | #62

I agree that a "call to action on a 'meta governance' discussion" is definitely in order. However, I don't think separation of powers and term limits addresses the more fundamental problem: that no collective prioritization method currently exists in any DAO, including the NNS. Political "solutions" are, at best, just limits or constraints upon dictatorship, which is the prevailing decision-making method when prioritization is required in large organizations. Prioritization represents true power, since that is how conflicts between competing alternatives, evaluators and decision criteria are resolved.

As part of my upcoming PhD studies, I have already offered DFINITY my time to explore and experiment with collective prioritization methods that could truly decentralize power. However, there appears to be no interest whatsoever from anyone at DFINITY in this collaboration, even when it would involve no investment on their part. Therefore, I honestly don't see this discussion going anywhere. 

I would only be interested in pursuing this discussion if it might lead to a change or improvement to the IC in the foreseeable future, I don't see that happening as long as no one at DFINITY is even willing to acknowledge that a "prioritization chasm" currently exists in both the NNS and SNS governance. It is simply not possible for power to be decentralized until this chasm is crossed. However, most individuals have great difficulty acknowledging this stark reality.

-------------------------

khm | 2022-12-02 22:21:06 UTC | #63

The smaller IC community of SNS-1 stakeholders might be willing to engage in developing solutions to the prioritisation challenge. SNS-1 is community lead and thus is not dependent on Dfinity prioritisation. SNS-1 could become a great learning ground for the DAO challenges that are coming upon us.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-03 00:19:30 UTC | #64

@khm, Is SNS-1 even a real DAO though? I thought it was just a trial run for the SNS token process. Once real DAOs under SNSs come onto the IC, I would be willing to work with them on any collective prioritization decisions. I agree that there could still be an opportunity to do some research without any real assistance from DFINITY. My hope is that DFINITY will eventually realize how large the "prioritization chasm" truly is in both the NNS and the IC ecosystem overall, but that will clearly have to wait for another year in the future.

-------------------------

khm | 2022-12-09 16:50:22 UTC | #65

@Sabr There is forming a group of people interesting in creating a government framework for SNS-1. You can find the public group here: https://oc.app/#/tf63j-6yaaa-aaaaf-becla-cai

There is also a private group for SNS-1 token holders. Request access by DM-ing EricRoseDev on OpenChat.

Would be great if you would join.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-09 21:02:50 UTC | #66

@khm, I've sent you a DM with a proposal about how a collaboration might work. If I decide to commit to the IC within the next couple of months, we can take the discussion further from there. In the meantime, please share my proposal thoughts with the SNS-1 chat group to see if there is any significant interest.
