I wish you a lot of success in scamming people in Sonic ppl !!

Just a how to in order to help you : 

- 1. Do not use UI so that your action will be fast.
- 2. ask the Sonic team how much steps and time they need for a swap to occure ( or test it yourself ) 
- 3. detect the amount USER A is intenting to swap ( thats not necessary but you get more control in how much you get afterwards ) 
- 4. use direct canister call to instantly swap huge amount, get the low price before USER A, Pump the price instantly ( he will buy expensive )
- 5. SONIC does not lock price / token so he ( USER A ) has not choice but to swap even at ratio 1/100 ( works even better min 1 of a LBP ) 
- 6. Instantly sell everything ( so you get the USER guy ICP and also what you invested )
- 7. Price will dump and USER A is REKT.
- 8. Sonic is not directly scamming, they just give a platform to scammer
- 9. You are just a normal USER ( LOL ) and everything is fine
- 10. repeat and become crypto billionaire
- 11. For people complaining, just explain them that they dont understand how LBP works and flood their warning with messages on the forum. Also push to remove his message and silent him.

Have fun @dominicwilliams @diegop @everyone

Please remove my account and silent me forever.

Weird, it seems it's a design decision from Discourse itself:
https://meta.discourse.org/t/delete-my-account/120331

You are right that it needs to be an Admin to delete/anonimize it:
https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/doesnt-seem-to-be-a-way-to-delete-ones-account/1820/3

About Sonic, if you had stated:
- I am concerned that XYZ algo is not yet working as expected, leaving many with a bad experience. Exhibit 1 and 2.
- I strongly discourage people from using this product as it is. Sonic team, any plans on improving this experience?

This would have been a much better approach than outright going on an attack with strong words like SCAM, stealing money, and so on.

One is constructive, the other is aggressive and humans just get emotionally defensive.

Hope this helps in some way.

Same thing occured in the past ( 5-6 months ago ), they did not change their UI.

So it looks intentionnal

draw your own conclusion
