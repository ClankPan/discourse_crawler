I published a new blog post in which I tries to display step by step how I generate on-the-fly "child" - or "bucket" - canisters in Motoko

https://6zvwc-sqaaa-aaaal-aalma-cai.raw.ic0.app/d/dynamically-create-canister-smart-contracts-in-motoko

Btw. today I started the beta of my blogging platform [Papyrs ](https://papy.rs) that runs on the IC. If you want to give it a try, reach out.

I also newly open sourced the app (SvelteKit) ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/papyrs/papyrs
The motoko code and providers (typescript) were already open source ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/papyrs/ic

Note: it's old, like 2 years old, absolutely no idea if it is still accurate.
