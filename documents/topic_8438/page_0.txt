" **identity.ic0.app** is currently unable to handle this request.
HTTP ERROR 500"

This is happening on NNS app, DSCVR trying to log in with anything Dfinity its been like this for 
well over 5 days, just tried getting onto the ICPsquad pre order page and that gives
me the error 500 as well.

Please sort this out its getting really frustrating I see alot of other people are having this issue as well

thanks.
