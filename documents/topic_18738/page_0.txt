Have we settled on an [ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) like standard yet? I know we've had discussions and all the early contracts included some version of this. Since we're working towards ICRC standards now I think we should try to get something done quick. 

## `icrc13_supports_interface`

Given a `text` interface name like `ICRC1`, `DLIP1v1`, `EXT` returns a bool 

## `icrc13_supported_interfaces`

Given a `text` interface returns a `vec text` of all supported interfaces.


```candid
service : {
    icrc13_supports_interface : (text) -> (bool);
    icrc13_supported_interfaces : () -> (vec text);
}
```
