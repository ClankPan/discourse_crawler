On the command to initiate [SNS treasury transfers](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals#transfersnstreasuryfunds), there is a field `from_treasury`. I understand this relates to the treasuries of ICP and the SNS native token. Is there a way to see which "treasury-id" corresponds to which? 

For example, does `from_treasury = 0` transfer from the ICP treasury and `from_treasury = 1` transfer the SNS native token? Is there a way to create more treasuries (e.g. 2, 3, ...)?

See [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/71f49422f411ed737b574e6d8dc238582de99026/rs/sns/governance/proto/ic_sns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L326C1-L332C4):
```
  // Whether to make the transfer from the NNS ledger (in ICP) or
  // to make the transfer from the SNS ledger (in SNS tokens).
  enum TransferFrom {
    TRANSFER_FROM_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    TRANSFER_FROM_ICP_TREASURY = 1;
    TRANSFER_FROM_SNS_TOKEN_TREASURY = 2;
  }
```

Thank you! What exactly does TRANSFER_FROM_UNSPECIFIED = 0; mean? What happens when you specify that?

It will return an error when trying to create the proposal. Here is the code of the proposal validation: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/7eace38b7580dc35af53b9180ea40480af4977dc/rs/sns/governance/src/proposal.rs#L517. I don't know why it exists in the first place but I think it is something to do with protobuf conventions.
