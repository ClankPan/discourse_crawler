I am trying to run this [optimisation tool](https://github.com/dfinity/decentralization) to get the Objective value for the feasibility of adding nodes but before and even after modifying the `df_candidate_nodes` function, the Objective value I am getting is Zero:

What could be wrong, or is this actually correct and normal? The model appears to be  running smoothly without any errors, all the dependencies installed.

Thank you.

Hi @iamenochchirima you are running the model correctly, no errors.

The ObjectiveValue having reached zero is correct. It basically means that with the current available node machines in the IC network, all decentralization targets are reached, an for now, no new node machines are needed to further improve decentralization. See also the discussion in two other forum threads, [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-node-provider-proposals/16643/322?u=svenf) and [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-topology-series-node-diversification-part-i/23402/13?u=svenf). 

Hope this clarifies!
