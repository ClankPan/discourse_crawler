Is "Dfinity" a reference to the Dfinity Foundation or what exactly is it. Sometimes it seems like it's interchangeable with "ICP" and sometimes a reference to an organization.

the original name of the blockchain was "dfinity" or the dfinity network and the foundation was the dfinity foundation. They renamed the blockchain to Internet Computer but kept the foundation name Dfinity, though I believe there is an Internet Computer foundation now also. why they chose to rename it to Internet Computer is something that I will never understand.

What on online search is like:
ICP - insane clown posse
IC - Random nonsense
Motoko - Ghost in the Shell cosplay
Internet Computer - Everything about internet and computers

I always just end up putting 'dfinity' in the search lol
