It’s difficult to find ICP projects on coinmarketcap or CoinGecko. Why?

The ecosystem is in a very early stage. There's only like 4 maybe 5 dexes. Only 2 of those are on mainnet (someone please correct me if I'm wrong). A vast majority of the popular projects on ICP haven't launched their token yet. I think 2023 will be when we see a lot more projects launching their token.

I think  just two tokens are listed on Coingecko.
One of them is Dogmi

Many projects haven't to launch tokens. The few projects  have launched don't have much demand and are built using multiple token standards. CEX will not cater to 4 or 5 different token standards unless there were extreme demand.  Now that the ICRC token standard is here it will make things easier. The IC also need more quality projects. Take Solana for example, it was it until a few months ago that the big exchanges started listing SPL tokens. Even then only a few of them are listed and they have been around much longer. These things take time to materialize.

I have searched for any update on this and emailed dfinity directly but not getting a response. Is there a schedual for enabling the icp token ecosystem to be traded on main exchanges? I found one reference to the Rosetta upgrade to allow trading but that’s all. Can you tell us more? All of us early adopters want to know, when this will happen?

Only exchanges know that. They prioritize their own listings

My guess is it will be several years until there's enough demand for an ICP token to be listed on an a cex.

In the meantime plenty of liquidity should grow on-chain

I was told by several dapps that currently there is no way to integrate the ecosystem tokens into other exchanges outside of icp, that the Rosetta upgrade is needed- are you a developer? Is this not true?
