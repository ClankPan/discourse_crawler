# About ICP Explorer


## Project highlights
Our product, ICP Explorer, is specifically designed for the Internet Computer ecosystem. We are dedicated to creating a developer-friendly, real-time, and user-friendly explorer that offers several benefits:

We have already achieved three significant milestones as deliverables: The completion of browser infrastructure and architecture design, the completion of the Home page, Transactions page, Neuron page, Proposals page, and the details of them.

Hello! Can you track the burning rate of an APP in your website, check the APP with the highest burning rate, many people have mentioned this recently, there is no IC browser to track

Loving it. 

One thing I noticed is that in the "transaction detail" page, the amount and fees appear to have the decimal point at the wrong place.

It would be could if it supported all ICP smart  contracts similarly to Etherscan.

Hello, Nathan here from 221Bravo.App ðŸ‘‹

I really like the website, looks clean and fresh. I was kinda hoping it was powered by the IC but I think it's hosted elsewhere? I know you're cross chain which I imagine might drive you to more traditional hosting/ DB products.   

It sounds like you've got a great team of devs. I wonder if there is merit in talking about you future plans in the ICP ecosystem? We've built (I would argue) a pretty decent ICP token explorer, which covers the main ICP tokens - providing indexing by block and account, top holders, visual explorers and other cool stats/ tools.

We're certainly looking to build more cool stuff and have an open view to working with other projects - who share our passion for ICP! 

Anyway, just thought I'd say hello :slight_smile:

Hi @LynnTsang , the link to github repo is not working for me :frowning: 

Even when I went to the Organization page, in all the repos, there isn't an ICP one.
https://github.com/orgs/footprintanalytics/repositories?type=all

Can you please check if it is already public?

I had a major question, where is the Data coming from? It looks like 100% of the data coming from the API of internet computer, or are you having a canister and querying/storing yourself some of this data?

Thanks and welcome.

Thank you for your feedback. This bug has been fixed.

-------------------------

ydpzg | 2023-11-13 10:29:54 UTC | #13

We are currently using the official API for data management. Additionally, we are also working on data storage.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2024-01-16 08:03:53 UTC | #14

Are you planning on providing a mobile version?

-------------------------

ydpzg | 2024-01-20 11:19:32 UTC | #15

We will make simple mobile adaptations in the next version iteration.

-------------------------

bixtechco | 2024-02-12 16:32:20 UTC | #17

Great projects. Will be using it more when we are building on top of ICP

-------------------------

baolongt | 2024-07-04 09:19:02 UTC | #18

The source code is private I think
