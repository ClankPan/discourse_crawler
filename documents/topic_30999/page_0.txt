I have a new website called Odoc and looking forward to fine some potential users where I can adjust my website to their own needs (for free). However, I want to get some users at this very early state cuz, I want to develop the website based on real world use cases. Finally, I am specially looking for a campy that has employees and they are managing their tasks. So, I need your help to find such a company especially in Estonia cuz they are very digital country and Odoc could be used even by the government it self and I am looking for ward to even register Odoc as startup in Estonia.
