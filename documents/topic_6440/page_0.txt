Hey everybody! We've put together a [little feedback survey](https://dfn.typeform.com/to/PLUv4CaL) around our [SDK Documentation](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/introduction/welcome.html).

We'd love to hear from you in terms of how you think our documentation & tutorials could best be improved. Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey! If you're open to hopping on a call to discuss your feedback at greater length, there's an option for that at the end of the survey.

Thanks, and looking forward to your feedback! üôè

Hi, I am not sure where to post it, but I believe there is a small mistake in the documentation of Motoko:

I believe tabulate creates an immutable array and not a mutable array. I know it is a small thing, but one could spend some time to figure it out.
