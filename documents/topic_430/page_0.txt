I just want to throw this out here to try and pursuade the team to take a serious look at GraphQL. It would be a boon to simplicity to provide first class native support for GarphQL in ICP nodes. GraphQL is already a standard language for APIs, it could be easily adapted for use in an ICP node. This would allow developers to reuse their knowledge of GraphQL without having to learn a bespoke rpc protocol. The schema of nodes could be published at an endpoint on the node, allowing easy hookups to an in-browser GraphQL IDE like GraphiQL, example of such an IDE openly accessible on the internet now: https://queryethereum.com
