I upgraded a canister and no errors, but I checked it on ic.rocks and tried to access it, it's not updated. I am not sure which step I did wrong?

dfx build
dfx canister install <name> --mode upgrade

You’ll need to include both the canister name and the `--network ic` flag to deploy to the mainnet, so

`dfx canister --network ic install my_canister --mode upgrade`

You can also try calling your canister’s public methods using dfx right after deploying

`dfx canister --network ic call <canister_name> <method_name> [argument]`

eg:

`dfx canister --network ic call my_canister getValue`

(More on the canister call command can be found here:
