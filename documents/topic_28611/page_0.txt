Hackers! I have released minor new versions of the ic-siwe React hook and the demo application. 

## [ic-siwe-react-demo-rust](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe-react-demo-rust) v0.0.4

Bye bye RainbowKit, hello nice looking custom connect dialogs. Live demo: https://shtr2-2iaaa-aaaal-qckva-cai.icp0.io/

### Added 

- Removed RainbowKit from the codebase and instead built some custom connect and account dialog components using wagmi. Removing RainbowKit means removing one fairly large dependency that bundles a lot of css and code to support various eth wallets that you (most likely) don't care about.

### Changed

- Upgraded wagmi to v2.5.7. This introduces TanStack Query as an additional dependency.
- Upgraded viem to v2.8.4

## [ic-use-siwe-identity](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe/tree/main/packages/ic-use-siwe-identity) v0.0.10

Now you can `await` the login flow to complete instead of solely having to rely on the hook state variables.

### Changed

- The `login` function now returns a `Promise` that resolves to the `Identity` of the logged in user. New signature: `login: () => Promise<DelegationIdentity | undefined>`.
- Upgraded wagmi to v2.5.7. 
  - This introduces TanStack Query as an additional dependency.
  - Also, this means the signture for `signMessageStatus` has changed slightly to `signMessageStatus: "error" | "idle" | "pending" | "success"`.
- Upgraded viem to v2.8.4
