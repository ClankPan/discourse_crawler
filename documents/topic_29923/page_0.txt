# Project highlights

The ICP Canister Bridge is a project that connects Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains with the Lightning Network using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) stack. This bridge enables seamless swaps of satoshis between the Lightning Network and EVM-compatible chains, providing a secure and efficient transactional framework. The target users are individuals and businesses looking to transact across different blockchain networks with ease and security. The project addresses the need for interoperability between various blockchain networks, allowing for cross-chain transactions and enhancing the overall efficiency of the blockchain ecosystem.

# Web3 advantages

The ICP Canister Bridge is a Web3 project that differs from traditional Web2 projects by leveraging blockchain technology to provide secure and efficient cross-chain transactions. Unlike Web2 projects that often operate within siloed systems, the ICP Canister Bridge facilitates communication and transactions between different blockchain networks, offering a level of interoperability that is not possible with traditional Web2 solutions.

# How is it built

The ICP Canister Bridge is built using a combination of technologies. It utilizes ICP for HTTP requests to communicate with an Express.js API that communicates with a Lightning Node. The ICP Canister interacts with EVM chains, while the Express.js API handles requests from the canister to the Lightning Node. The project’s front end uses Reactjs, Webln, and Ethers.js, which are integral to its total functionality. The architecture is designed to support two methods of swaps: a peer-to-peer marketplace-like system and swaps executed by the canister itself, offering flexibility to users.

# Internet Computer superpowers

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is a key feature that makes this project possible. The ICP stack allows for the creation of a bridge that can interact with both EVM-compatible chains and the Lightning Network, providing a secure and efficient way to facilitate cross-chain transactions. The project uses Threshhold ECDSA chain key signatures to allow verification of signatures sent to the canister, in order to process payments to the correct user, and by handling get/post requests to the Express js API.

# Go-To-Market strategy

The project plans to attract users through partnerships with blockchain networks and by engaging with the broader blockchain community. By demonstrating the benefits of seamless cross-chain transactions, the ICP Canister Bridge aims to become the go-to solution for users looking to transact across different blockchain networks.

# Monetization
The project’s monetization strategy is currently under development. The team is exploring fee models.

# Status of the project

The project is currently in development, with the core functionalities being tested and refined. The team is working on integrating the bridge with various EVM-compatible chains and the Lightning Network. In this step we focused in Rootstock and Sepolia network due the fact that the first uses RBTC as native cryptocurrency, which is the same to pay gas fees, while the second uses a token (WBTC) to represent satoshis, requiring us to make the Canister have different treatments to check and performs evm transactions.

# Future Plans
The project’s future plans include expanding the number of supported blockchain evm networks, improving the user interface for a better experience, review the Express js API in order to use and test Lightning Node Connect to allow Lightning Nodes connected under Tor Network become a service and also stop using the Alby public testnode to simulate the service.
Review the verification of the Lightning payments done at EVM to Lightning petitions swaps due the fact that Lightning payments are private and we can’t know which node paid an invoice, requiring us to make a security step before releasing funds to EVM chain. We consider changing the way the payment is done by first making the solver generate an invoice from the Canister’s owner Lightning Node, perform the payment and then request to release funds, which will trigger the Canister to pay to both Petition Requestor at Lightning Network and Petition Solver at EVM chain.
As last plan we would like to implement swaps between Lightning Network, EVM chains and ICP ckBTC.

Very happy to see the name of Rootstock (RSK). This is a project that we have been following since 2017. We had a good chat with Diego at that time. There is a great possibility: the largest and most commonly used bridge between chains is with Bitcoin.
