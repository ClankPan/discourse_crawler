I am trying to transfer ICP using plug wallet but the following code produces error. I cannot figure out what is wrong with it

```js
const transfer = async () => {

      const params = {
        to: `${AccountIdentifier.fromPrincipal({
                principal : Principal.fromText('rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai'), 
                subAccount : SubAccount.fromPrincipal(Principal.fromText(canisterId)) 
               }).toHex()
            }`,
        amount: 100000000,
        opts: {
          memo: "1347768404",
        },
      };
      const result = await window.ic.plug.requestTransfer(params);
      console.log({result});
      
    };
```
but i am getting this error 

>VM50:221 Uncaught (in promise) Error: The transaction that was just attempted failed because you don’t have enough funds. Review your balance before trying again, or contact the project’s developers.

    at t.receiveMessage (<anonymous>:209:857)

**I have created a Testnet on Plug and am interacting with it. I have ensured I have enough ICP. Also when I transfer manually with same parameters transaction goes through**

Any insights as to what could be the cause of this error will be really helpful.

Update : I found the solution just replaced the above code with following snippet 

 ```
const transfer = async () => {

      const params = {
        to: `${AccountIdentifier.fromPrincipal({
                principal : Principal.fromText('rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai'), 
                subAccount : SubAccount.fromPrincipal(Principal.fromText(canisterId)) 
               }).toHex()
            }`,
        amount: 10000000,
        opts: {
          memo: "1347768404",
          fee: 10000,
          from_subaccount: null,
          created_at_time: {
            timestamp_nanos: null
          },
        },
      };

      const result = await window.ic?.plug?.requestTransfer(params);
      console.log({result});
      return result;

    };
```
