I got assigned to a project that has already a canister deployed on Internet Computer. What is the process I have to follow in order to gain access/"rights" of that canister and start the development? 
Would it be wiser/easier to deploy a new canister from the start?

You have to get access as a controller somehow. Either your principal has to be added to the canister as a controller, or you have to get authorised in a wallet that has controller access to that canister.

If you are not a controller you may not install new code in the canister
