Hey guys, my canisters suddenly stopped working (both local in development and already deployed ones).  Actor from @dfinity/agent never completes its query (used to work without problems on multiple canisters). Happened like an hour ago.

What could be the cause? It happened to all my canisters (already deployed without me changing anything).

If it happened in local, then it must've been something you did.

Did you upgrade any libraries? Need more information or can't help lol
