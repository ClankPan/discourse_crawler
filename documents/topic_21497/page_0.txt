Hi everyone,
[https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/custom-domain/)
I understand that I can achieve a custom domain using the methods described above.
Are there any other methods other than the above? I was wondering about the following two, but I did not understand them. For example, if I want to set a custom domain for the front-end canister, can I achieve with the following?

Unfortunately its not possible to use IC Naming or ICNS to create custom domains yet, but this is something that is on the Naming System roadmap. If you want to follow along for updates you're welcome to follow the working group: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/technical-working-group-naming-system/21236
