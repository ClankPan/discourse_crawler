Hey all,

Iâ€™m Kresna - an anesthesiologist by day, a newbie blockchain developer by night. I found Dfinity by chance while researching blockchain networks I'd like to work on. I was fascinated by the ambition and mission to remake how the internet and blockchain would look like in the future. Any idea about decentralization and the distribution of anything would easily catch my attention.

So I'm here is to learn about the Internet Computer, hoping to build something worthy and contribute back to the community.

Cheers from the beach :beach_umbrella: :palm_tree: :sunrise:
