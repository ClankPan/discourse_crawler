I'm excited to share [`motoko-library-template`](https://github.com/kritzcreek/motoko-library-template) with you. It's a GitHub template that lets you kick start your Motoko library development, by setting up a project with:
- A build/test development workflow using [`vessel`](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel)
- GitHub Actions CI setup
- Automatic documentation generation and hosting on GitHub Pages

The template will also set your library up in way, that makes it easy to include in our community [`package-set`](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel-package-set), making it available for other Motoko developers.

Please give it a try and let me know if instructions are unclear, or assume knowledge you're lacking. I'm trying to make the template the easiest way of getting started with Motoko library development, but I need your feedback to get it there.

I'm looking forward to using all of your new libraries to help me build my IC applications ;)
