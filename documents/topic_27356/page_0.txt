I just deleted a canister, considering that Papyrs is deprecated, but it still appears on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/undmj-fiaaa-aaaan-qaocq-cai). Does it take some time for it to be completely removed, or do deleted canisters remain displayed on the dashboard indefinitely?

Strictly a curiosity question, not an issue at all.

If a canister is deleted, it will still appear on the ICP Dashboard, but it will have no controllers and no module hash. There was however an issue with detecting canister deletion which we discovered thanks to your post. This has been fixed, so the deleted canister `undmj-fiaaa-aaaan-qaocq-cai` now shows no controllers or module hash.

Although this is how deleted canisters have always been handled, the team is planning to change this behavior so that deleted canisters no longer appear on the dashboard.

Thanks Dylan for the answer and glad to hear my post was useful.

I thought canisters on the dashboard were all of them active, that metric is not trustworthy then. Please can the team fixed that? So we can see the real canisters active and running, and not a lot of smart contracts like on other blockchains that are full of smart contracts but dead.

I agree; it would be beneficial to track the total deployed canisters and active canisters separately. Deleted canisters should be included in the total count but not in the active count.
