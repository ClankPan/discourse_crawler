It seems that when there are multiple same-named HTTP headers in a request:
```
    public shared func test(): async Text {
        let headers = Http.headersNew();
        headers.put("Host", ["local.vporton.name:8081"]); // overrides the default
        // Add arbitrary headers for testing:
        headers.put("Content-Type", ["text/plain"]);
        headers.put("X-My", ["my", "my2"]);
        let res = await Call.callHttp(
            {
                url = "https://local.vporton.name:8443";
                headers = headers.share();
                body = "";
                method = #get;
            },
            null,
            {
                max_response_bytes = ?10_000;
                cycles = 900_000_000_000; // TODO: much too much
                timeout = 60_000_000_000; // 60 sec
            },
        );
        let ?body = Text.decodeUtf8(Blob.fromArray(res.body)) else {
            Debug.trap("No response body.")
        };
        body;
    }
```
(a code from currently debugged https://github.com/vporton/joining-proxy-rust), then HTTP outcall preserves only one header. That's wrong. Multiple same-named headers is legit in HTTP and they should be preserved.

However, this may be a fake alarm, I didn't thoroughly test it yet.

@kpeacock The bug was confirmed by a [minimal example](https://github.com/vporton/multiple-headers-bug).

The outgoing in an outcall HTTP headers are erroneously crumbled (headers with duplicate names are removed, what should not).

The incoming HTTP headers to IC are processed correctly.

Where to report the bug in Replica?

Hey, according to the HTTP spec, you can simply concatenate all values using a comma. E.g.:

```
Accept: text/html
Accept: application/xml
```

is equivalent to

```
Accept: text/html, application/xml
```

I hope this helps.

@christian Current Replica removes a part of fields altogether rather than concatenating them. So, it's a bug.

Second, [Field Lines and Combined Field Value](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-field-lines-and-combined-fi) does not warrant that a client or a server will consider the meaning of a repeated field equal to its combined value.

Particularly, AFAIK, it is an error to combine several `Set-Cookie` into one separated by comma.

Right, this would not work for `Set-Cookie` as it uses a specific format to separate different attributes of a single cookie.

Thanks a lot, we filed a bug and will look into it.

But note that "default" headers (Host, Content-Type, and (in some reason added by IC) Accept; maybe I forgot some) that are added by default, should be overwritten by user query rather than added to them.

Thanks for the bug report. Indeed you are right that we remove some headers that have the same header name. 

The fix has been [merged](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/f22bc3f34eee21f53e26b995652c8d1c28db5991) and should be deployed on mainnet in ~1.5 weeks.

Again thanks for reporting and providing a reproducible example!
