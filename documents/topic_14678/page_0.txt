Hey Arthur, 

Thank you for this write up. I'm glad you are still involved and writing down your thoughts. I thought you'd might have ejected out of the ecosystem after the cycle_dao sunsetting post. 

I would very much like to see a similar process to the one you described here. I feel that at the moment people who put resources into the ecosystem that isn't staked ICP like liquid funds or their time aren't properly represented. 

I created the http://alwaysvotes.xyz/ neuron mainly for myself to express this view, but I hope it will be useful to others as well.
