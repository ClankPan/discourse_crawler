We still don't have string interpolation, but you can have something similar by `debug_show`-ing ad-hoc records and resorting to field punning:
```
let some_binding = ...;
let other = ...;
debug {
   Debug.print(debug_show {some_binding; other})
}
```
will nicely output `{ other = ...; some_binding = ... }` to the console.

Enjoy!

PS: I found this in the `moc` test suite, btw. Not sure who came up with it first.
