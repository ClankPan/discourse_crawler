I saw in the recent announcement of developer grants that one of the winners was "Secure Voting and Auctions". If the winner of that grant is here, could you PM me? Or could someone put me in touch with whoever won that grant? I'm a voting systems nerd, and I'd love to offer some thoughts or see if I could help somehow. Thanks!
