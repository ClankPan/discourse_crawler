When attempting to switch to ic-wasm, I noticed it didn't do as good a job at optimizing as ic-cdk-optimizer. See more information here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/wasm-module-contains-a-function-that-is-too-complex/15407/43

This thread is just to spur conversation on improving ic-wasm to have parity with ic-cdk-optimizer on compression of the binary. Though, if Wasm binaries could be larger, this need would probably be less of a priority: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/allow-installation-of-large-wasm-modules/17372
