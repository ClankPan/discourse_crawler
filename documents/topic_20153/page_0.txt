**[Querio](https://querio.io/) code search** is live and it puts the ICP ecosystem’s code at your fingertips!

‘</>Code’ can search through the open-source code within the entire ICP ecosystem. The new feature is designed especially for the ICP community, with a particular focus on developers.

Getting help and inspiration on writing motoko code is now easier with Querio. Our team is already using ‘</>Code’ internally to speed up the development of Querio’s search engine using Motoko.

Additionally ‘</>Code’ comes with predefined search keywords that modify the way Querio retrieves results:

> **mo:** - perform searches only on .mo files,. Eg: “**mo: hashmap**” will return all .mo files that contain the word “hashmap”
> 
> **js:** - perform searches only on .js files. Eg: “**js: canister**” will return all .js files that contain the word “canister”
> 
> **ts:** - perform searches only on .ts files. Eg: “**ts: canister**” will return all .ts files that contain the word “canister”
> 
> **rs:** - perform searches only on .rs files. Eg: “**rs: mutex**” will return all .rs files that contain the word “mutex”
> 
> **md:** - perform searches only on .md files,. Eg: “**md: game**” will return all .md files that contain the word “game”
> 
> **jsx:** - perform searches only on .jsx files,. Eg: “**jsx: swap**” will return all .jsx files that contain the word “swap”
> 
> **tsx:** - perform searches only on .tsx files,. Eg: “**tsx: ledge**r” will return all .mo files that contain the word “ledger”

Very cool. Will be super helpful
How are you indexing github? I ask because when i do the 'mo:___' search i find other repos but not mine: https://github.com/EdjCase

Thanks! We're currently searching for repositories that have dfinity dependencies in the package.json files, and looking at your repo, you're using a .toml file. 

Based on your observation, we'll improve the scraper to also search for dfinity dependencies in .toml files.

@Gekctek Querio is now scrapping the dfinity dependencies in .toml files. 

[Here](https://querio.io/?q=EdjCase&type=code)'s a link to 'edjCase' query.
