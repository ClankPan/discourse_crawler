The Rise Of The Magni will be hosting a tournament where players will be playing against one another near EOM. Are there any optimizations that could be done in IC in preparation for the tournament at the subnet level ?

(A) additional nodes?
(B) distributed nodes ? (Particularly near Australia/New Zealand)
(C) others

Hi @mparikh 
Unfortunately we can't provide optimizations on the subnet level.
