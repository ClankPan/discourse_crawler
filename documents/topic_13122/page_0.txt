I'm trying to understand how data is persisted on the IC and have a few questions:

* Is Canister application data (stable var data) written to the blockchain?
* If it is, can it be retrieved from the blockchain?
* if not, what is written to the blockchain?

Thanks

Yes, canister data is written to the blockchain. Raw blocks cannot be retrieved I don't think (or at least not easily).

Blocks contain all types of "replicated state", including canister state but also  system state like input and output queues. I believe stable memory is part of that system state.

See this [whitepaper](https://dfinity.org/whitepaper.pdf) for details.
