**Problem Statement**:

Many individuals lack specialized assistance when planning menus for events or estimating food quantities, recipes and costs at home. Especially the local food!

**Proposed Solution**:

* 1. Specialized food companion and catering assistant

* 2. Verifiable AI for planning menus and food estimations

* 3. Access to distributed and local food datasets from multiple creators.

# FOODFOLIO.AI

A Consumer product that empowers creators; chefs, nutritionists and other enterprises to own and create food assistants for their followers.

***Deliverables***:

1. Alias Blueband-ICP: a vector database on top of ICP

2. OpenAI for public usage (without need to create or fund an API key).

3. Endpoints for creation, inserting & querying of vectors inside cannisters.

4. System for third parties to extend Highfeast Explorer as a customisable dietary AI agent.

5. A mobile-first user interfaces for improved accessibility and user retention.

## What we've achieved

1.  Creating Internet Identities from ERC4337 Social Logins, connecting to ic-siwe-provider canister

    - *Addresses: Deliverable 1 & 2*
    - This opens up opportunities for chain fusion integrations and onboarding of our off-chain business models in future.

2.  Deploying Bucket cannisters to Hold each creators raw data and embeddings.
    *Addresses: Deliverable 1 & 3*

4.  Integrating a custom `ic-use-vector-db` package
    *Addresses: Deliverable 3 & 4*
    Exports functions to `init` a creatorâ€™s `localIndex`, `saveEmbeddings` of documents stored in the cannister, and perform `similarityCheck`

5.  Custom API acting as middleware
    *Addresses: Deliverable 2 & 4*
    Handles communication with OpenAI, with http outcalls from our backend canister to `fetchingQueryResponse` and `creatingEmbeddings`.

## Next Roadmap

`Foodfolio is made for everyone`

A B2C model. Our primary audience for marketing are the creators, who, in turn, will drive user adoption. 

Although weâ€™ve delivered this part of our milestones, foodfolio is still on the road to beta and some of the items on our next roadmap include

1.   Abstracting the vector-db so itâ€™s usable in multi-contexts/projects.
2.   On-chain business model, enabling creators to pay onchain per use-limits.
3.   Open Beta.
4.    Access-control: Allow creators to set conditions for using their assistant, such as identity-whitelisting, token-gating, and custom rate limits.

Hello all, as feedback, can you update the `ic-use-blueband-db` GitHub with a README with more details on how it works? Do you have a Twitter/X handle?

It would be great to promote it alongside other vector DBs on ICP including Kinic and ArcMind.

Thanks for the feedback @jennifertran 

I have just created a separate [showcase](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/blueband-vector-database/33934) for blueband and will be updating the `README.me` on the GitHub and demo as well.

X handles: [@dreampiperDAO](https://x.com/dreampiperDAO)  [@foodfolioAI](https://x.com/foodfolioAI)
