I am trying to take an [existing project](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse.git) implemented in Rust and run it in a canister. I am using the [dfx tutorial](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/work-with-languages.html#_using_rust) for rust which seems most appropriate (i.e. starts with cargo new and adds dfx.json and a candid file). This suggests that I only need to: 
	* Add a dfx.json with "build":"Make", etc
	* Add a .did file (I am not sure what would need to be added here)
	* Register a network-specific identifier for the application
	* Compile the program with a target output of WebAssembly
        * Allow the main.rs file to require inputs (or alter it)

I was attempting to see how easy it could be to run the Lighthouse ETH client on a cansiter (https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse). I knew there would be storage limits hit and also then became aware of the inability to send http requests from the IC. I was just very curious as to what is the easiest way to run existing Rust Code in a canister.

This explains some of the constraints:
