Hello, I am following the documentation as per [https://docs.nfid.one/identity-kit](https://docs.nfid.one/identity-kit) and the library doesn't seem to exist? I also tried installing nfid/embed and i got an error for dependencies.

The package @nfid/embed requires @dfinity/agent version >=1.0.1 || <0.20.0-beta.0.
However, @dfinity/auth-client needs @dfinity/agent version ^0.21.4.

How can I adequately solve these dependency conflicts? using--legacy-peer-deps does not work.
Is there a more reliable library for integrating multiple wallets?

I don't use those NFID libraries, and you should probably reach out to them directly. However, I just wanted to say that I agree with you: there is no `@nfid/identity-kit` or `@nfid/identity-kit/react` published on NPM.

If you search for "nfid" on NPM, those libraries are not listed: [https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=nfid](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=nfid)

Is there an alternative library to manage multiple wallet integrations? Or will i have to integrate each separately?

There are two actually, Artemsi and connect2ic

https://github.com/sonicdex/artemis

https://github.com/Connect2IC/connect2ic


My preferred one is Artemis

IdentityKit is work in progress based on the ICRC-25 (and extensions) signer standards from the Identity & Authentication Working Group. These libraries (once completed) should allow interaction with all wallets on the IC that comply with the ICRC-25 standard (Currently NFID, Plug and others are actively implementing right now).

So in a bit more time, hopefully things will be generally available and standardized. For now I'd recommend using any existing multi wallet library or manually implementing each wallet ðŸ˜…

Do you have any examples implementing artemis?

-------------------------

Yes, 
https://app.appic.solutions 

and in their github you can see how they've used Artemis

Adding a "Work in Progress & not yet publically available"' flag to the [documentation](https://docs.nfid.one/identity-kit) page might have avoided misunderstandings, just thinking out loud. :wink:

My apologies - you and everyone are correct that this is still a WIP. I'll add that today/tomorrow. Thank you @peterparker.

FYI on progress:
- [Thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/wallet-and-identity-standards-progress-towards-launch/31240) started
- Presentation scheduled for next wallet standards working group meeting June 4 at 16:00 UTC ([calendar link in github](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication?tab=readme-ov-file#meetings)
- Will present: base standard, get_accounts, get_delegation, call_canister (these will enable 99% of most critical user interactions we see in other networks)
- NFID Wallet will support the standards at launch
- Oisy will also hopefully support the standards at launch
- Internet Identity is prioritizing verifiable credentials support over conformance to standards, which seems to indicate we won't see their support until late Q3
- Plug might support them at launch, but likely not for some time since I haven't yet seen them in the standards group
- Stoic and AstroX ME seem to have been deprioritized and are unlikely to receive any updates
