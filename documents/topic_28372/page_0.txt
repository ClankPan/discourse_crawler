The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals today, 2024-03-12. DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals this Friday.

This release enhances the logic of the Neurons’ Fund participation in SNS decentralization swaps, implementing the outstanding components of the design from https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/124822. Before, the maximum possible Neurons’ Fund participation for a given swap was 333,000 ICP. If this release is adopted by the NNS community, the maximum possible Neurons’ Fund participation will be defined in terms of XDR (currency code of IMF SDR), configurable via `ManageNetworkEconomics` NNS proposals; the limit will be initialized to 750,000 XDR. The XDR-based limit will be converted to ICP using the 30-day average rate, taken on the day of the `CreateServiceNervousSystem` proposal execution.

Other features included in this release:
* Proposal summary limit to increase from 15KB to 30KB (for both NNS and SNS).
* NNS Governance open proposal deadline metrics to include proposal action type.
* Registry to permit multiple signing subnets for the same key.
* Canister log visibility to become parameterizable during canister creation.
* Bug fix in the Registry canister’s Candid service definition.

## Features

* Neurons' Fund participation is now limited to 750,000 XDR (used to be 333,000 ICP). The new XDR-based limits are taken from NNS network economics (configurable via NNS proposals and served via the public API). The limits are converted to ICP using the 30-day average conversion rate from the CMC, taken on the day of the `CreateServiceNervousSystem` proposal execution.
* Proposal summary limit is increased from 15KB to 30KB (for both NNS and SNS).
* NNS Governance metrics now include proposal action type.

A duplicate proposal was created by accident to upgrade SNS-W.

It is safe to pass both, or to reject one and pass the other.

These proposals refer to the same upgrade.

* SNS-W: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128320
* Registry: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128322

Update. Since these proposals have been adopted, the new XDR-based limits are being used. 

Please note that https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/tokenomics does not currently show the correct Neurons' Fund participation values; the work for fixing this tool is already being carried out. I will post an update to this thread when the issue is fixed.
