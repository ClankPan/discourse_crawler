Hi im having a bug using tailwindcss on my frontend canister, so the thing here is the frontend of the project was built already with the custom reactjs and tailwind css so im trying to migrate it to the icp, i actually did after replacing custom files with the frontend's own and modifying the package.json file, i installed all packages but i noticed the css wasnt there anymore when i deployed , the colors still appear but the css and aligning was gone, tried searching couple reasons online, i didnt have a webpack.config.js so i created one and pasted the code snippet on icp's website on it, tried creating, tried creating a postcssconfig file too, so after doing this and i try deploying , i get an error how postcss file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension in the package.json file, any help on this to understand whats happening  please?

What is the React framework that you are using?

I have an example of a [React project](https://github.com/jennifertrin/web3points) that does use TailwindCSS. Can you please take a look at what might be missing?

If your project is open source, feel free to share. If it is not, feel free to DM me.
