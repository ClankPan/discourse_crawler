I recorded the status of the canister and found that after some operations（call canister's method for  add data and  delete data）, the memory became larger and there were more cycles. But now I don't know how to reproduce this situation. What is the reason for this phenomenon?

The memory size increase is explained [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motoko-array-memory/5324/5?u=jzxchiang).

No idea why the cycle balance is increasing though. You sure nobody is adding more cycles to it?
