**The ckETH integration could be a major come back.** But when?

**1.** 
Are there **any updates** on the development progress, and some rough timeframe of the final release?

**2.**
Once it hits the streets, **will** **Dfinity & ETH** **work together** in some ways, so that the **Internet Computer** can **help fix** some of the **underlying issues** that ETH has?

**3.**
**Will** Vitalik ETH mention to his audience that **ckETH** got released and is ready for new usecases **?**
(Since **we are not enemies**, and both could **help each other grow** in many ways) 
Serious question..

Here is one related screenshot from **[July Global R&D meeting](https://youtu.be/w7wuXKOgY-8?si=krg6q1px0j3HzZrK)**, hope it helps (but indeed best to watch the whole session):

<br>Plus, this seems to be the right **forum topic for ckETH discussion**:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cketh-a-canister-issued-ether-twin-token-on-the-ic/22819

<br>Regarding **cooperation with Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik** I haven't seen any info, best if @dominicwilliams or @Jan could respond :pray:

Thanks for the helpful answer. Always watch the R&D meeting but somehow slipped my mind..
So Q4 is going to be very interesting for the IC ecosystem in general, also on the Origyn side.

**It should be possible.**
I mean.. Even if they have different and somewhat competing projects going on now, they used to work together in this space. Im sure they still are friends somehow.
**If it was me** and i was on the winning side of it (on top of the world) like Vitalik, i would give a old friend a shout out *for sure..* :100: Just **as a kind gesture** - a quick shout out - to lift you up real quick. 
Thats all i had to do. 

After all the **hard work** and all the **unfair threatmen**t ICP / Dfinity has taken over the last 2 years, it would not even be bad to ask if he would initiate a quick **shout out** about the **launch of ckETH** and its features. Or maybe im living in fairyland with my thoughts :smile: @dominicwilliams @Jan

FYI here is an update from @dominicwilliams which might also (partially) cover questions in this topic:

Thank you very much. 
So, we dont need a shout out anymore :smile: :love_you_gesture:
This will be way more effective then that... :fire:

The crazy thing about ICP with its chain-key crypto, it can create a CK twin from any other blockchain, talking directly to the blockchain itself ---- **"without need for permission or agreements."**

Quote " What’s on Etheruem, can also be brought to the Internet Computer, without need for permission or agreements."  wich partly answered the question above. 
I see it as, there will be no need for asking for a shoutout.
