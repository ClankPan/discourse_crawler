I am currently building a small web-browser extension that'd allow users to manage DFINITY identities (something similar to Metamask)

Would it be possible to set in the browser `window` a different Http Transform Pipeline ?

If it's not set, it can default to the current signing strategy which is using localforage.

I imagine something like `window.dfinity.httpTransformPipeline`

Implementation in bootstrap.js could be:

```
const transformPipeline = window.dfinity.httpTransformPipeline || getDefaultPipeline()
(...)
request = transformPipeline(request)
(...)
```

You can override anything in ic, it’s not sealed. You can also just use your own agent. 

Agents can take a “parent” agent to copy everything and add to it.
