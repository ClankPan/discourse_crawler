It is always so funny that guys in the blockchain world want to call the police or sue someone in court. I used to think that the blockchain guys are all anarchistic. 
We are in a decentralized autonomous organization, and thus submitting a proposal to the NNS for the investigation of price manipulation seems more reasonable, or maybe you can just try the Foolâ€™s Court? :rofl: :rofl: :rofl: (Just kidding)
