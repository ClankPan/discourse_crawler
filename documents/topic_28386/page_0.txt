Fellow Degens, 

Allow me to introduce our Swimming Pool protocol: https://swmpool.xyz. Swimming pool is an onchain permission-less stablecoin protocol, where you are able to collateralise your BTC, ETH and other crypto assets.

We have been awarded the ICP Developer Grant to deliver a PoC. We are aiming to continue our development on ICP in the nearest future. 

Our protocol envisions a dual stablecoin issuance, allowing users to borrow against their crypto assets by issuing single-asset backed stables. As a next step users are able to either spend/repay their existing loans or exchange their single asset-backed stables for Meta stable coins -- a basket of loan obligations. 

We are using canister functionality to create unique single asset loan-to-value parameters for each individual crypto, starting with ckBTC, moving to ckETH and ICP. In essence, we want to create a DAI 2.0 where instead of a basket of crypto, underwriting DAI users will have a basket of loans, each individually underwritten by unique LTV rates.

We have built the PoC with use of Motoko. 

Canisters can be checked here:

-- stable_token: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=zy76v-wiaaa-aaaan-ql4hq-cai

Our go-to market is liquidity pull once the test protocol will go live. We will power up a number of social mining campaigns to ensure that our protocol has sufficient liquidity to execute on orders. As a next step we will work with market makers and other liquidity providers, allowing them to hedge their positions and holdings. 

The protocol will have a dedicated token, which will act as a fee conduit for transactions and will act as a governance tool via our stake-vote mechanics, primarily focusing on single-asset stablecoin allocations in the meta stablecoin. 

Our current project status is PoC, as we dive deeper into multi-asset functionality. 

We loom to raise pre-seed and seed rounds once testnet is up and running.

Can this pool include mortgage ICP lending? After all, ICP is the most important asset of this network. The number of BTC and ETH assets in ICP is very scarce and cannot provide much liquidity.

ckBTC for now, followed by ckETH and ICP. We do envision this to be the first cross-chain algo stable.
