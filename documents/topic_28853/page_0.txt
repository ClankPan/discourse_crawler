Hello everyone!

Please allow us to introduce our developer-oriented tools platform: Hamster - a one-stop infrastructure, developer toolkit and middleware DevOps service platform. It can help everyone complete ICP-based projects more efficiently.

**What is the Hamster Platform？**

Hamster is the one-stop infrastructure, developer toolkit and middleware DevOps service platform, empowering projects in Web3.0 to improve their coding and delivery speed, quality and efficiency, as well as product reliability & safety.

The goal of the project is to greatly reduce the threshold for developers to use and make their development process more focused on their own business content.

**What We've Done for ICP Developers？**

We provide ICP developers with the ability to quickly start projects, as well as ICP Canister Development Kits, to help ICP developers reduce development barriers and efficiency. We gain project development momentum through the tool type services we provide.

We have implemented the following features:

* Added ICP project templates function, allowing developers to quickly create their own ICP projects through the interface using pre-set ICP project templates, greatly improving development efficiency.
* Added one-click deployment for ICP applications, supporting one-click deployment of front-end projects and smart contracts, providing developers with a fast and efficient deployment solution.
* Support container management via page operations, including cycles recharge, controller management, container status query, etc., making development and operations management more convenient

We have provided convenient development support tools for ICP developers. Through features such as project templates, one-click deployment and container management, we open up development opportunities for developers and promote the building of the ICP ecosystem. We will continuously optimize and provide more functional modules to build an efficient and open development environment for ICP.

**2024 roadmap for Hamster**

We will continue optimizing the user experience and service capabilities of "Hamster" with artificial intelligence as our core technology.

In 2024, we have three major highlights planned:

1. Intelligent Agent: Based on AI technology, we will launch the first generation of intelligent agents on the data chain to automatically assist developers with code audits, bug detection, function recommendations, and other work, significantly improving development efficiency.
2. Automatic Development Capability: Integrate intelligent toolkits with IDE to achieve partial process automation of development, such as automatic script generation, case implementation, unit testing, dependency management, etc., making development more like playing with building blocks.
3. Developer Ecosystem: Build an ICP ecosystem-oriented developer community and application store to support developers in innovating applications through community interaction and commercialization models, benefiting the industry.

We hope to use artificial intelligence to allow every developer to enjoy an efficient and delightful development experience. At the same time, we aim to build a complete set of tools for the construction of the ICP ecology. We look forward to witnessing the growth of "Hamster" together with you in the future!
