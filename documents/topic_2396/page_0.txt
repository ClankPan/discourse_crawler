As I understand, `ICP` is a canister-based token, unlike `cycles` which are hardcoded into the system. 

I don't know it for sure, but I'm assuming this because of the general Dfinity's trend to make thin-yet-powerful core and express other things as canisters on top of it. And it also just makes sense to move ICPs to a higher abstraction layer, right?

If that's so, Dfinity will also propose a token specification (like ERC-20 or so). If that so, could we have a chance to take a sneak peek at it, even if it's draft? 

For me personally, this would be very helpful to know if you have any plans to include `sendAndCall` capabilities (like in `ERC 677 or 777`) by default or I should come up with my own solution for this problem.

Thanks!

:heavy_plus_sign:  re: token specification sneak peek; I'm starting work on a large project that will run on the IC and am drafting my implementation of our token right now. Having at least a rough semblance of what interface Dfinity expects tokens to conform to for use in any sort of decentralized exchange etc. would be *very* helpful :pray:
