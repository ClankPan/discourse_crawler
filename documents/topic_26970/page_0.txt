Is it possible?

This would make code for defining and accessing stable structures much simpler

Strictly speaking, you don't need to use `thread_local`. You can use other alternatives like the [lazy_static](https://docs.rs/lazy_static/latest/lazy_static/) crate, for instance. However, that won't be any simpler, so between the choices out there I'd suggest sticking with `thread_local`.

Unfortunately there is no other way that I'm aware of to be able to declare global mutable variables in Rust that would be simpler. [This blog post](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#canister-state) discusses the alternatives and why `thread_local` is the best option.
