I get an error

```
Error: The transaction does not satisfy the cycle minting canister payment protocol. Desciption: Intent in the block (0 == unrecognized: Memo(0)) different than in the notification (1095062083 == CreateCanister)
```

when trying to call `CMC.notify_create_canister(...)`

I send ICP using `icrc1_transfer`, so I need a memo in `Blob`, there are no problems with `transfer`, but I need a new `icrc2_transfer_from` to pay from other accounts. That's why I started by using `icrc1_transfer`.


[details="motoko code"]
```
let fromSubaccount : A.Subaccount = A.principalToSubaccount(invoice.owner);
let account : LedgerTypes.Account = {
    owner = Principal.fromText(CYCLE_MINTING_CANISTER_ID);
    subaccount = ?A.canisterToSubaccount(self);
};
let result = await Ledger.icrc1_transfer({
    to = account;
    fee = ?FEE;
    memo = ?Text.encodeUtf8("CREA");
    from_subaccount = ?fromSubaccount;
    amount;
    created_at_time = ?Nat64.fromNat(Int.abs(Time.now()));
});
```
[/details]

Also I try directly with js, same error.

How to correctly specify `memo` for `icrc1_*` api?

I'm getting an error somewhere [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/nns/cmc/src/main.rs#L1296:L1302), but I don't understand how to get around it.

Hi @rabbithole,

I don't think that's possible at the moment. ICRC_1 populates the ICRC_1 memo of a transaction, but the cycles minting canister (which is the canister that mints the cycles out of the ICPs you send) is still oblivious to that field; it only looks at the "old" u64 memo so it sees 0 (which I think is the default value).

Thanks for the quick response! I was hoping to remove the internal user account and use the allowances from ICRC-2. It turns out I have to postpone this until better times.

Yes: until the CMC canisters hears about the new ICRC standards :slight_smile: -- but this is a good datapoint when we prioritise the work we pick up
