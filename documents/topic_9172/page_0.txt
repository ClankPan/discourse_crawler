# Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights

Today, before the proposed change, all proposals are rewarded equally. This means that automatic voting through following on exchange rate proposals, which happens every 10 minutes (circa 144 times per day) and maintenance proposals (typically 1-6 per weekday) provide the same voting rewards as a deliberate manual vote on a motion proposal. This means that neuron holders deliberating and manually voting on motion proposals have a negligible impact on their voting rewards.

@johan and I propose to make two changes to incentivize more community participation in the governance process.

**First**, we want to disable default following for proposals on the governance topic (which currently includes motion and uninstall proposals). The main reason for this change is that most neurons follow the beacon neuron of the Internet Computer Association (neuron #28) as this has been the default value since Genesis. For most neuron holders, it makes sense to follow the ICA beacon neuron for maintenance proposals, like adding and removing nodes and upgrading the replica version. However, for governance proposals, the ICA or the DFINITY Foundation should not be the arbiters. While we encourage neuron holders to deliberate and manually vote governance proposals, neuron holders that don't want to manually vote on governance proposals can still configure their neurons to explicitly follow a neuron or set of neurons that they trust on the governance topic.

**Second**, we want to weigh the voting rewards based on the topic so that exchange rate proposals receive a much smaller weight (our proposal is 0.01) and governance proposals (motions in particular) gain a much higher weight (our proposal is 20). Proposals on other topics have a weight of one.

## Motivation

In a typical week, the total weight of exchange rate proposals will be roughly 10 (144 * 7 * 0.01) and maintenance proposals will add up to a weight in the range of 5 to 30 (based on historical data).

As a significant portion of voting rewards will now come from voting on governance proposals, neuron holders have a strong incentive to either vote directly on all governance proposals or explicitly configure their neurons' following for such proposals.

## Further guidance to neuron holders

For neuron holders with many neurons, we suggest picking one main neuron (probably the one with the longest dissolve delay) and having all other neurons follow this main neuron on the governance topic. The neuron holder can then either vote manually with the main neuron on governance proposals or have the main neuron follow a set of neurons that they trust.

Neuron holders have been able to change their default followees since Genesis, as well as specifying overrides for specific topics, but this feature is not yet widely known or widely used.

![governance 1|429x500](upload://pLrJalCz49w7u0NYe2uc0jAUorF.jpeg)


Click "Edit Followees".

![governance 2|421x500](upload://JAj57rJVVfoCjUlvPq4iNO3xQm.jpeg)


Click "Add Followee" for the "Governance" topic. Then use a known neuron ID or pick one of the named neurons. In this case, I picked the DFINITY Foundation.

![governance 3|467x500](upload://7SXq9XyCR0JMqnbwAJxi3ExyhLj.png)

As a final note, if this proposal is adopted, the NNS dapp user interface will be updated to say "All Topics Except Governance" instead of "All Topics".

## What we are asking the community

* Read and comment on this proposal
* We will submit an NNS motion this week on it, based on feedback

If this passes, would existing neurons no longer be configured to follow the foundation on governance topics? Or would this change only apply to new neurons?

Will the ICA or foundation continue to vote on governance? So that neuron holders could configure their neuron to follow ICA or foundation on governance without incurring a penalty?

How would a neuron holder get notified when a governance proposals is available if they wanted to vote?

Is there any bonus for voting on a proposal yourself vs configuring the neuron to follow another neurons vote?

 For example, a neuron could receive a small portion of the voting rewards of each neuron that follows it.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-11-29 19:40:17 UTC | #3

I think I'd be ok with this if the minimum time period for any vote that 'required' a manual vote was extended to one week.  I run a charity that has a specific mission to vote and I am deathly afraid of missing a vote with the current 1-day threshold.  We want people to participate, but it can't become their job. Actually...It WON'T become their job so the form has to fit the people who will participate...and I would imagine we would want those people to include people who aren't currently paying attention, and who have far less time and attention on this topic that those of us on this forum.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-11-29 19:48:49 UTC | #4

A community funded project or dapp to send email / push notifications when a new governance proposal comes out, and warning when one of their neurons haven't voted yet with only 1hr left to vote would be a good solution.

aaa10247 | 2021-11-29 19:53:00 UTC | #7

-------------------------

ildefons | 2021-11-29 21:08:51 UTC | #8

I understand that for those who want to continue delegating and automating the governance vote we would  just have to assign a followee for governance proposals. Is this correct? so, will it still be possible to automate the  governance proposal votes? If not, manual voting would be a HUGE staking deterrent for people looking for a passive investment

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2021-11-29 22:07:58 UTC | #9

You have neglected to mention a few facts that total reward by Internet Computer will not change with this proposal. You are simply proposing moving some rewards from other neuron holders! What is so wrong is that you can have two identical eight years locked neurons. If your proposal passes, two similar neurons can receive different rewards by stealing from the other neurons or whatever you call! Your justification is to be voting manually! To me, someone can make a bot vote manually for them! Not all of us are capable or willing to use a bot, which is a scam itself. Most people can not vote all the time manually. Most of us have full-time jobs, kids, and other responsibilities! Shame on you that you even propose something like this. How about doing something positive other than trying to steal a reward from an 8 (4) years locked Neuron holder! This rewarding will feed more and more unjust practices up to scams!

Hi there,

Just to be clear (from the initial summary, added emphasis myself): 

"*While we encourage neuron holders to deliberate and manually vote governance proposals*, **neuron holders that don’t want to manually vote on governance proposals can still configure their neurons to explicitly follow a neuron** or set of neurons that they trust on the governance topic."

-------------------------

diegop | 2021-11-29 22:36:06 UTC | #11

Good questions. I have pinged @johan to provide a detailed answer.

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-11-29 22:38:39 UTC | #12

As I read it, this is just about whether the *default* is following dfinity on governance votes. Users can still follow them if they want to.

-------------------------

plsak | 2021-11-29 23:52:55 UTC | #13

From my understanding a lot of people like to follow the default neurons (ICA or DFINITY) just because they trust that they will make decisions best for future of Internet Computer.
Gaining such trust might be problem for other neurons - how can anyone get to know them, should people watch every other neurons every voting and social media responses, what if they change opinions...?
There are already neurons which are suggesting to be followed, but it could eventually lead to same result as with the default following - people will choose randomly one of acceptable (and most loud/visible) neurons to make sure they vote, just with more general stress (a lot will be unhappy that had to do that).

So what about not changing the 'follow neuron' options - not forcing people to change things - and just motivate people by extra bonus for manual voting (though I'm not sure if NNS can reliably distinguish that).

Who wants to follow other neurons can do so, who wants to stay passive can do so, who wants more rewards will be active and who will be active will be extra rewarded :slight_smile:
I understand that main goal is to more decentralise the voting power - extra rewards for manual voting would for sure lead to higher activity - thus better decentralisation.

-------------------------

ildefons | 2021-11-30 00:01:17 UTC | #14

@plsak, what you suggest would deter staking from passive investors which is not a good idea. In any case, @diegop make it clear that we will still be able to automate the voting of governance proposals.

-------------------------

plsak | 2021-11-30 00:06:43 UTC | #15

We'll I suggested None change for passive investors - only option to get extra reward for active ones. Also it's clear that following still would be possible, I expressed worry that people will be just unsure about other than default neurons.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-11-30 02:06:03 UTC | #16

I think this proposal would decentralize voting power and I support it. I agree with @skilesare that the voting period needs to be extended to at least 1 week and have more accessible messaging about when proposals are up for vote. 1 day is just too short and highly subject to gaming the timing.

I would add that a nice coupling to this proposal would be some sort of pseodo-official "election" period or roadmap thread where interested parties could campaign for followers. Otherwise, I see a lot of people just switching their governance votes to one or two other neurons well-known neurons, which would defeat the proposal's intent.

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2021-11-30 02:51:39 UTC | #17

We are and can vote manually whenever we want! There is no reason to change it! When we manually vote, Dfinity or whoever we follow cannot vote on the same vote again. If we choose not to vote manually, it is consent whoever we do follow to vote on behalf of us. If the reward is increased for a manual vote, it just opens a big can of worms! How can you distinguish between actual manual votes and bots! Most people have a full-time job, our lives busy as is! The reason some companies offer cash rebates by mail or registration. They know only up to 80% will mail or register! Keep the remaining portion! This is kind of like that. Without question, some will miss the manual vote, and their rewards will be taken from them and given to those who voted manually or come up with a bot to vote for them. It is unfair, it is wrong!

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-30 05:15:01 UTC | #18

I like this proposal a lot. Routine maintenance proposals should not carry as much weight as motion proposals when it comes to voting rewards.  ICP is a governance token and I think active participation should be incentivized more than passive participation.  Especially on motion proposals where we should want people to spend time learning about the topic and voting individually.  I would go as far to say that liquid democracy should not be allowed on motion proposals.  However, if liquid democracy is allowed then I do think that manual voting should be rewarded more than liquid democracy to encourage individual participation.  Either way, motion proposals really should start with a required deliberation on the forum to give everyone an opportunity to learn the topic and know when the vote will occur.

As a side note, it would be helpful if a proposal ID could be assigned to a forum topic when the forum topic first starts.  It is much easier to refer to Proposal 12345 instead of having to write out Proposal for the Yada Yada Yada every time you refer to the proposal.  Motion proposals should be more than title and summary…they should be linked to deliberation IMHO.  

Perhaps the motion proposal is first made as an announcement through the NNS and a forum topic is automatically created with a proposal ID and title.  Somehow the first forum post needs to be reserved for the originator.  Then after a deliberation period the originator can submit the formal motion proposal summary.  I think it is also important for the originator to set a reasonable schedule for deliberation and voting.

[/quote]

I think maybe @johan and my writing was perhaps vague, so I apologize. I will clarify:

1. manual votes do NOT get increased rewards

2. Current state of the world is that many people click "follow all topics" and walk away. A blunt way of describing this proposal is:

a. Give governance topics more rewards (they are much rarer after all)
b. Don't make governance topics THAT easy to follow as they currently are. Just add a few more steps to follow neurons for governance. That added friction for liquid democracy is a small price to pay for a thoughtful community. 
c. Our belief (which we could be wrong) is that this small friction for following (setting your neuron to follow a particular neuron for governance rewards) is something so small that folks interested in rewards would gladly do it.

In the case you mentioned, you could easily follow a neuron. No bots or manual checking needed if you so wish.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-30 05:32:45 UTC | #20

@skilesare @rubenhorne 
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think the issue with voting period isn’t so much that we need more than 24 hours, but rather we need the vote to be scheduled.  In other words, if the vote on a motion proposal is scheduled 1 week in advance, then people have time to review the summary, detailed documentation, deliberation, etc.  Does the actual vote really need more than 24 hrs plus wait for quiet?

-------------------------

johan | 2021-11-30 09:05:39 UTC | #21

> If this passes, would existing neurons no longer be configured to follow the foundation on governance topics? Or would this change only apply to new neurons?

Currently neurons by default follow the ICA (#28) on "all topics" (aka fallback topic), but without override for any specific topic. This change would exclude the governance topic from "all topics", i.e., fallback would not apply to the governance topic. Thus, the proposed change would apply to all neurons with the default configuration. That is, if this change is made, neuron holders have to explicitly add followees on the governance topic if they don't want to vote manually.

> Will the ICA or foundation continue to vote on governance? So that neuron holders could configure their neuron to follow ICA or foundation on governance without incurring a penalty?

Good question. I think there will be proposals where the ICA and/or the DFINITY Foundation would like to abstain in the future. However, this is not a change from the present situation.

> How would a neuron holder get notified when a governance proposals is available if they wanted to vote?

There is a Telegram bot @NNSProposalsBot. However, I acknowledge that the notification mechanisms need to improve!

> Is there any bonus for voting on a proposal yourself vs configuring the neuron to follow another neurons vote?

Not as part of this change - but this is a good idea (Dominic has also mentioned this). However, this is not uncontroversial. Perhaps it should be tied to people party validation of personhood and/or CAPTCHA-like bot prevention to ensure that only truly manual votes receive an extra voting reward. I think this warrants a separate discussion.

-------------------------

johan | 2021-11-30 08:45:09 UTC | #22

Voting rewards don't take into account *how* the vote was cast - neither on mainnet today and not after the proposed change. That is, it does not matter (for voting rewards) who you follow (as long as they vote) or whether you vote manually.

Note that you can follow multiple neurons, in which case you vote with the absolute majority. For example, if you follow five neurons, you automatically vote yes/no as soon as three of the neurons you follow have voted yes/no. In addition, if you manually vote before your followees have reached a decisive majority, your manual vote stands.

(Outside of the proposal discussed here, it has also been proposed to provide larger rewards for truly manual votes. But this is also a can of worms, as pointed out by other community members.)

-------------------------

johan | 2021-11-30 09:00:47 UTC | #23

As @diegop points out, the proposed change is just to the behaviour of the "fallback". Neuron holders can still configure their neurons to follow other neurons on the governance topic.

The motivation for this part of the change is that most neuron holders have not changed the default setting and follow the ICA.

For "maintenance proposals" (e.g., upgrades, adding/removing nodes, etc.), this is a reasonable choice as the ICA and the DFINITY Foundation have a lot of insight into these types of proposals, which are typically put forward by employees of the DFINITY Foundation.

However, for proposals on the **governance** topic - currently motions guding the future roadmap and canister uninstalls (aka takedowns) - the ICA may want to abstain and it is preferable that the community has a stronger voice.

-------------------------

janosroden | 2021-11-30 09:45:16 UTC | #24

It can, see https://github.com/chmllr/nns-proposals-bot

> Enter `/start` to subscribe to the notifications; use `/stop` to cancel the subscription. Use `/block` or `/unblock` to block or unblock proposals with a certain topic; use `/blacklist` to display the list of blocked topics.

So for example `/block topic_subnet_management` will block the Subnet Management topic.

-------------------------

plsak | 2021-11-30 10:57:45 UTC | #26

@diegop my point is that disabling option to follow the default (ICA...) neurons for governance proposals could be quite dangerous:
* people who want to follow neuron will often make just a quick search through social media - so paid advertisement could give anyone a huge voting power
* other neurons will be more prone to manipulation or eventual corruption
* may be later could be even sold (?) - IC is/will be a multibillion $$ business, what would be a value of neuron with 1m followers?

For this reason I believe that best for healthy decentralisation would be to motivate people to vote directly:
* **nothing would change for passive investors**
* rewards for manual voting would follow same path as for `people party`
* if above would be not acceptable, could we think of some other kind of rewards like other tokens, cup with favourite developer in underwear or something else... :)

Regarding opening a `big can of worms`, isn't `Internet Identity` purpose to prevent this and if there are some `gotchas` it should be rather fixed?

**Update**:

*I accidentally copied the images in the main summary in the wrong order, but discourse is not letting me edit, soo I will paste the correct ordering below:*

Neuron holders have been able to change their default followees since Genesis, as well as specifying overrides for specific topics, but this feature is not yet widely known or widely used.

Click "Add Followee" for the "Governance" topic. Then use a known neuron ID or pick one of the named neurons. In this case, I picked the DFINITY Foundation.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-11-30 18:18:27 UTC | #29

Is there really a difference between scheduled and voting period?  I mean, it is a computer system so if a proposal is "scheduled" I should be able to indicate how I want to vote once voting "opens".  It would be great if an item could go in and be "scheduled" and I could indicate my vote...and change it up until the "voting opens" period. I want at least a week to get indicate a vote.  Once we get our axon fork up we'll be putting ICDevs votes up on it.  If we only have 24 hours to get it up, rally the troops, and get votes in...we aren't going to be successful.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-30 23:02:20 UTC | #30

Deliberation will continue as a vote is spread out over a long timeline, which means early voters will make decisions based on different information than late voters.  It seems preferable for deliberation to occur first and then for the act of voting to occur based on a consistent information.

There is also (or at least should be) a buildup to these motion proposals because they can have wide ranging implications for the IC.  It seems there is value in expecting folks to take the time to vote in a relatively narrow time window to make it practical to rally around the governance process and advocate for participation.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-12-01 07:38:37 UTC | #31

I like this change. Will vote for it (provided the deadline gets extended to, say, a week).

It's ok if you want people to deliberately vote on governance or at least stop using the default DF follow.
But why do you want to change the voting weights? A vote is a vote in my opinion. That aspect is not broken.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-01 16:06:26 UTC | #34

Could we please give this 10 - 14 days to stew? I feel like we want the broader community to become aware of this coming change before the proposal is submitted. Also, Both ICDevs & cycle_dao, as groups offering follow target neurons, need time to prepare an outline of governing philosophy & ideally submit proposals to have our neurons in the NNS follow target list. This has been on the radar since your earlier proposal @diegop but you just move so darn fast (if you'll pardon my french).

-------------------------

darien | 2021-12-01 17:44:12 UTC | #35

This is a great suggestion in my opinion.....motivate  Manual voting by rewarding with something that is fun to get but has no significant $$ value

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2021-12-01 18:54:22 UTC | #36

Let's do this on the 10th? Agree with sentiment, since this change affects governance, but is pretty straightforward. We need more people actually voting on key matters using their brains rather than just auto-voting by following big neurons. I think once people realize they actually have to vote on motions to get their rewards, and start looking at them, we will see rising engagement. I expect this to catalyze the growth of ICP's digital governance ecosystem.

Well for sure better than searching for neurons to follow in random media, but doesn't seem to address the decentralisation much (ICA & DFINITY => ICDevs & cycle_dao) - but hopefully during time the list would grow.

Still, could you please consider the option to motivate people to vote manually (though not sure if it's technically feasible)?

Rewards could be even just some 'IC Engaged NEURON Level X' NFT badge or so, I'm sure people would want it (I just got here 'First Like' badge and I liked it :wink: ), vote manually more and thus engage more...

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-01 20:53:08 UTC | #42

I 100% agree with your sentiment. 

However, encouraging manual voting also encourages thoughtless voting. For example, say manual voting received a 2x multiplier. Then you are paying people to vote arbitrarily and diminishing the returns of thoughtful delegators. The prop as it stands is two steps in the right direction. It increases the reward weighting of major decisions and shifts people off the Foundation neuron for such decisions. We can continue the conversation about how to decentralise governance further here. Incidentally, People Parties have a role to play in the future of decentralising governance on the IC and diversifying influence away from the current plutocratic model so right there is a whole bunch of stuff to think about. If we are really doing this in the next 10 days better that it be a minimalist proposal.  A journey of a thousand miles . . .

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-01 21:20:53 UTC | #43

I share your concern about thoughtless voting, but I also think the majority of that concern is resolved by effective deliberation prior to voting, keeping the voting period reasonably short, and a concise yet complete summary presented to the voter as part of the proposal.  If you give people clear and consistent information, then the votes that are cast are less likely to be thoughtless.

-------------------------

plsak | 2021-12-01 21:41:13 UTC | #44

Thank you, you are right, my suggestion would require much more time to consider, develop etc (I previously overlooked the time constraints).

Still I can't agree with
[quote="Arthur, post:42, topic:9172"]
encouraging manual voting also encourages thoughtless voting.
[/quote]

* people who vote have staked neurons and their goal is increase of it's value
* to achieve above, most voters would get at least basic overview and vote to the best of their knowledge
* indeed not everyone is able to consider all possible consequences of specific proposal - and in such case the vote might be considered `thoughtless` - but frankly, who is...

But this would be more for a `philosophical` discussion with glass of beer, again thank you for the response, for me I'll most likely approve when this gets to NNS.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2021-12-01 22:01:22 UTC | #45

I also think that forcing manual voting doesn't necessarily favor automatic voting, because that assumes people who have staked only want the reward, rather than having an effect on the system, even though that effect may directly impact future rewards. Whether it's automatic or manual, I imagine a person's interest in the outcome of proposals would remain basically the same, except that with manual voting they can't rely on someone else to make the decision for them. When they don't know enough to make an informed vote, I imagine they will be likely just follow the current majority as another way to "go with what others think".

Pwoseidon | 2021-12-03 11:27:18 UTC | #47

We have a complex issue with multiple factors. This direction is the most sensible for embracing decentralized governance.

Allowing people to explicitly follow neurons they trust is also vital. Some people may not have time everyday to login and vote (E.g. students/healthcare workers/parents with small children/etc). The NNS runs as smooth as possible, but it’s a little clunky and requires a bit of patience (maybe only on iOS?). I know, with my schedule, I wouldn‘t keep up with manual daily voting. 

On the flip side, if only manual voting was available, we could fight inflation 🤔😂.

-------------------------

doo | 2021-12-08 14:33:29 UTC | #48

I am an ordinary user who pledged for 8 years and have always followed the community fund to vote. The reason why I followed is not mandatory, but the level of awareness within the entire system is limited, and many votes will get results. I don't know how meaningful he represents and whether it is correct. In this case, if I can vote, I would vote for the neutral option, but he didn't, so I chose to follow the community fund because I believe in the community fund. If manual voting can increase voting rights and revenue, then users like me will be confused between right and wrong to vote, which will affect the correctness of the voting results, so the choice of following the community fund is as a person like me. The best choice for users like me, because we choose neurons that we trust instead of letting us disturb the voting results or follow whether a neuron is the same as me. This result is terrible. What I worry about is the neuron voting result. Correctness is distorted.

wpb | 2021-12-11 02:54:32 UTC | #49

Hey @diegop and @johan was there anything actionable in this deliberation that is causing you to rethink this proposal?  I noticed an NNS motion hasn’t been presented yet and you indicated that a proposal would be made in a week when it was first posted 11 days ago.  I’m just curious about your current thinking.

This proposal would have a profound effect on voting for governance proposals.  I know many opinions have been expressed so far, but I’m not sure if you think any of it is actionable.  If seems reasonable to make changes if you want, but it also seems reasonable to let the governing body vote via NNS proposal in the current form.

Actually, the delay in submitting the motion was just caused by an oversight at our end. Both Diego and I were OOO on Friday and we both thought the other proposer would create the motion. We will put it out today for a vote, unchanged, and have the NNS decide on it in principle. If the community wants to modify the weights, for example, a separate motion can be created for that.

Motion #34485 is live: [https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485)

(please ignore motion #34484. That is an earlier proposal with typos)

The motion proposal passed, but how can we tell if it was implemented and deployed?

I wonder if the code change has made it to the latest "Bless Replica Version" NNS proposal.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-01-05 00:35:12 UTC | #53

Reasonable question. Here is what I know:

* the team has been working on making the code attached to the NNS updates transparent
* I am not sure if this particular proposal's code has been updated. I will ping the NNS team.

There is an open merge request that implements this feature, but it has not yet been merged into the NNS canister.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-01-05 08:05:18 UTC | #55

Thanks for updating, John.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-01-22 16:18:08 UTC | #56

Do you know the timeline for implementing this change?  Would you please send a link to the request?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-01-27 23:45:41 UTC | #58

I do not know the timeline, and it is merge request 2447.

So in the recent medium article here(https://link.medium.com/XEiJDlSManb),

Dom states: 

"IMPORTANT REMINDER: as of a recent network update, neurons can no longer vote automatically on “motion” proposals, and you must therefore remember to manually vote on motion proposals to receive your maximum voting reward, especially since motion proposals are also now weighted more highly."

Is the statement from Dom different than implementing the change in this topic?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-01-28 01:51:53 UTC | #60

I’m sure that statement is a direct result of this deliberation, which resulted in proposal ([34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485)), which passed.  However, that proposal had no code changes attached.  I have been looking for it to be implemented programmatically, but I’m sure the proposal has not been implemented yet.  

When it does get implemented, I think what Dom means is that neurons will no longer be configured with any Followee on the Governance topic unless they manually configure a Followee.  Currently, the All Topics catch all includes the Governance topic and all neurons are configured to follow ICA on All Topics by default when the neuron is created.  Changing the Followee on All Topics or adding any Followee to any individual topics (including Governance) is a manual action.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-01-28 02:08:56 UTC | #61

So the change is not yet implemented. 

When it is implemented, in order to get maximum gain, the neuron holder will either :

(a) need to vote manually on all proposals for governance topic

 OR 

(b)  manually change the followee on the governance topic so that they can automatically follow the followee for proposals on the governance topic.

Is this correct understanding?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-01-28 04:59:59 UTC | #62

Looking at the internal code proposal, the default followee will not cause your neuron to vote on Governance topics, but an explicit followee still will. This may change in the near future, but that's the current status of the work.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-13 23:49:53 UTC | #63

When this proposal is implemented, I think it will incentivize the IC community to submit more Governance proposals.  Since Governance motion proposals do not have any code attached, I think it is likely that the vast majority of the proposals that are actionable will rely on Dfinity to implement if they pass.  Could you please explain how that will work?  How do we know if and when DF will prioritize implementation among existing activities?  Or is the vision that most proposals can somehow be implemented by the community?  I know there are efforts in progress to make submitting proposals easier for everyone.  I suspect there is a plan being developed that enables the community to some day push code with proposals.  I’m just trying to get a sense of timeline and expectations from the DF perspective in case this proposal stimulates high interest from the IC community to see more governance proposals due to voting reward changes.

The implementation of this proposal (https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/eaa04ff0840eee4c99e6e21abf58ba759eb74d98) is now merged to master (Thursday last week) and will be included in the next Governance canister upgrade proposal (today or tomorrow).

[quote="diegop, post:1, topic:9172"]
As a final note, if this proposal is adopted, the NNS dapp user interface will be updated to say “All Topics Except Governance” instead of “All Topics”.
[/quote]

@diegop is this still happening?

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-02-15 01:10:19 UTC | #66

Yes it is. NNS frontend dapp will b updated as well

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-02-16 07:43:26 UTC | #67

Minor nit: is it possible to enable selecting text in the Proposal Summary? I can't click on any of the links in the Proposal Summary section for any proposal in the NNS dapp. I also can't select neuron IDs to copy and paste elsewhere.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-02-16 14:02:36 UTC | #68

Not all proposals render properly on NNS frontend dapp (being worked on), but I recommend clicking on links from dashboard version of proposal. That’s what I do: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance

Thank you for taking the time to clear my doubts. 

Your position is correct and I was mistaken. 

I contacted the entity responsible for creating the spam proposal directly and they confirmed ICPMaximalist had no part in it. 

I must say I’m impressed that you took the time to clear my doubts.

I feel much more confident in Dfinity and ICP. Thank you!

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-10-27 15:40:42 UTC | #70

Thank you @Johnchiby . 

Your intellectual honesty, good faith questions are very helpful. I am sure many people had the same, but you had the initiative to ask proactively. No small thing. Thank you once more.

By the way, I think you meant to reply here :wink::
