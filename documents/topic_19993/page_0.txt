Hello everyone, I have a React frontend where I use the library connect2ic/core/providers/plug-wallet to implement wallet authorization. Additionally, I have containers for creating orders or token exchange, with a personal account for topping up. When I authenticate, a user is created locally using an agent. However, on the production server, there is strange behavior where the connection through the plug does not work, and the connection request does not even appear.
