Recently I watched the video for [candid bindgen](https://youtu.be/0OVViUa-A-U?si=jPxJGK7iYQuYHS0-&t=2103) but cannot search for this package. Anyone know where is the package?

The Bindgen tool can be cloned [here](https://github.com/chenyan2002/typed-codegen) which is the same repo that Yan used in the video.
