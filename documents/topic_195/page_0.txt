Any plans for public git versioning feature on the DFINITY Platform as part of IDE workflow for development and collaboration? Or simply use github? If i’m not mistaken, it doesn’t look like github recognizes Motoko yet. Will it be added? Maybe the info I seek is elsewhere but couldn’t find it. Please point in the right direction if I missed it. Thanks!✌️

AFAIK, this is governed by [GitHub's Linguist library](https://github.com/github/linguist). So, someone will have to raise a pull request to add Motoko.

The `contributor.md` mentions this though;

> We try only to add languages once they have some usage on GitHub. In most cases we prefer that each new file extension be in use in hundreds of repositories before supporting them in Linguist.
