What are current technical risks involved in creating a fiat-backed stable coin using the ICP and Motoko. 

Does the Dfinity Foundation offer consulting and/or auditing services to help ensure the viability and reliability of projects. 

Any recommendations for companies that have the know-how and experience working with ICP.
