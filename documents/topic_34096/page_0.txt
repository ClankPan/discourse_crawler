I am applying for Dfinity's $5k Developer Grant.

This project aims to leverage DFINITY's Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to develop a secure, interoperable, and decentralized Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. The goal is to address critical challenges in the current NHS EHR ecosystem, including data fragmentation, security concerns, and lack of interoperability.

Key aspects of the project include:

1) Developing a functional prototype demonstrating ICP's real-world healthcare applications
2) Engaging with NHS professionals to gather healthcare-specific blockchain requirements
3) Comprehensive testing of ICP's performance in managing health data at scale
4) Exploring regulatory compliance in healthcare, potentially opening doors for ICP in other regulated industries

This project presents a unique opportunity to showcase ICP's potential in transforming healthcare data management, potentially accelerating its adoption in this critical sector and expanding the research documentation scope of the DFINITY ICP blockchain technology.

Feedback, suggestions, and discussions are warmly welcomed. Your insights will be invaluable in refining this project to best serve the healthcare sector and demonstrate ICP's capabilities.

Please review my application below and discuss! 
They will be collected by DFINITY. When one week passes, DFINITY will release them and they will appear as a new section on this post.

I'm looking forward to everyone's input!

I have sent you the code multiple times. You must copy the ENTIRE code from the attachment I sent and edit your forum post with it. It is literally just copy and paste. Don't take part of it out or edit it.
