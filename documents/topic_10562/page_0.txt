@kpeacock i have a follow up question to this comment üëáüèæ

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/integrating-with-the-internet-computer-ledger/2542/38?u=jesse 

Do you know where i can find an example of converting an `accounting-identifier` To a `Text`? I‚Äôm trying to do so by calling `Text.DecodeUtf8(accountId)` where `accountId` Is a `Blob`, but I‚Äôm just getting `null `  returned.

It is all binary. You can convert them to hex, I have [an example here](https://github.com/ninegua/tipjar/blob/main/src/tipjar/Util.mo#L145).

For reference to others, here's an example to do that in typescript
https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/stoic-wallet/blob/1db3ed63cfe4bad68ca7c0783ad37f6b32757cd8/src/ic/utils.js#L45

@quint Wrote an [encoding](https://github.com/aviate-labs/encoding.mo) library that others might find useful if they want to do this on the Motoko side of things.

```
import Hex "mo:encoding/Hex";

module {
    // Represents an account identifier that was derived from a principal & optional subaccount.
    public type AccountIdentifier = Blob;  // Size 32

    // Hex string of length 64.
    public func toText(accountId : AccountIdentifier) : Text {
        Hex.encode(Blob.toArray(accountId));
    };
}
```
