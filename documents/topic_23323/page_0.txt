I am unable to deploy an existing React application as frontend canisters on the ICP.

Whenever I run `dfx deploy`, it runs and I receive a frontend canister local link but the components are not rendering. I receive the error `Could not find a canister id to forward to` when I navigate to the link and a `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)` in my console.

If I run `npm install` and `npm run dev`, I am able to run localhost:3000 and see the components.

Here is how I built the application:

1. I first built a React application using `create-react-app` in Typescript (end product is similar to this: https://github.com/shahinadev/create-react-app) and now am refactoring the code to deploy the React application as a frontend canister. 

2. I created the following dfx.json manually:

```
{
    "canisters": {
        "app": {
            "frontend": {
                "entrypoint": "src/index.tsx"
            },
            "source": [
                "src/assets"
            ],
            "type": "assets"
        }
    }
}
```

3. I navigated to the folder and ran `dfx create canister app`. This created a .dfx folder.

What could I be doing wrong?

my suspicion is that your `source` is not pointing to the compiled website. It should point to the directory that's created when you run `npm run build`, which is probably `dist`

Thank you so much. This did work! I pointed it to my `build` folder which is created after I ran `npm run build`.
