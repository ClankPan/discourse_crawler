Is there any way for push notifications to be sent without it being dependent on an api provided by a centralized entity? I’d love to be able to include some sort of notification system into my app but not if it requires me to make a node.js server that I’ll have to host somewhere else.

You can use Web Push Notifications but they aren’t supported in Safari on macOS or on iOS at all.

Some people have speculated that the reason for the lack of support by Apple is that app developers could otherwise provide an experience that is on par with native apps but bypasses Apple’s app submission and review process.

> Web push notifications are notifications that can be sent to a user via desktop web and mobile web. These are alert style messages that slide in at the top or bottom right hand corner of a desktop screen, depending on the operating system, or appear on a mobile device in a manner nearly identical to push notifications delivered from apps. Web push notifications are delivered on a user’s desktop or mobile screen anytime they have their browser open — regardless of whether or not the user is on the website.
