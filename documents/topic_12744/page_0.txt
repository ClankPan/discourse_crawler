Why I cannot vote with my neuron.
Why there is no voting power on my neuron? 
Currently, the Maturity doesn't increase.
Anyone can help this?

Seems that it is because the dissolving days is less than 6 months.

Increase dissolve delay to 6 month or  more. If you choose  6 moth exactly and hit start dissolving then inmidiately you will have less than six month and wonâ€™t be able to vote.

so if neuron is less than six month, it won't have reward?

Exactly right, if you want the reward, the neuron need to be more than six month, that' the design.
