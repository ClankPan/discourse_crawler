Hi

This might look like a basic question, but I could not find the answer in my searches. I tested my canister in local environment (192.168....) and deployed it on ic network and have a canister id on the network: 
{
  "CanCan": {
    "ic": "uaim5-2aaaa-aaaai-qaesq-cai"
  },
  "cancan_ui": {
    "ic": "bv7wf-6qaaa-aaaai-qahbq-cai"
  }
}

How can I now send requests (using agent) to the CanCan ic address?

Before I was using 192.168...:8000/
