Can anyone help me fix this?

` dfx canister install --all`
Installing code for canister dbank, with canister ID rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
Error: Failed to install wasm module to canister 'dbank'.
Caused by: Failed to install wasm module to canister 'dbank'.

      The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai cannot be installed because the canister is not empty. Try installing with mode='reinstall' instead."

The error message contains all info you need: `‚ÄúCanister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai cannot be installed because the canister is not empty. Try installing with mode=‚Äòreinstall‚Äô instead.‚Äù`

The IC is very specific in how it accepts code to be installed in order to prevent mistakes. Now it assumed that you trying to use `--mode install` (the default one) means that you made a mistake since you already installed code earlier.

Possible source of the error: You forgot to run `dfx start` with `--clean`. I make that mistake at least daily myself...

Thanks! But I somehow fixed that by downgrading dfx to 0.9.3 from dfx 0.12.1. Dfinity community is amazing. üëåüèª

I'm getting below error while running given piece of code in ubuntu terminal.


```
open http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=id: bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai

also if possible check my question on stack [StackQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76718920/issue-while-running-http-localhost8080-icp-application-but-it-asking-me-us)

`dfx start --clean` worked for me thanks :)
