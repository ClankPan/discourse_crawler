how does this single address own 200+ Motoko mechs which have never been traded ?

Over 10% of supply given to one person ? I own multiple IC nfts so I’m just genuinely curious as I missed the launch of Motoko mechs…I’ve tried asking what happened with the distribution but I can’t find any answers


I think the community deserves an answer


ANSWER: These are leftover Motoko Mechs from the airdrop, reserved for registered supernova participants but who never claimed. These are owned by Dfinity. Dfinity will decide what to do with these moving forward.
