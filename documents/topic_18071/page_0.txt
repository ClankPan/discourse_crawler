`let icrc_token_canister = actor ("r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai") : ICRCTypes.TokenInterface;`

works fine.

The problem is the "`and`" operator. It doesn't join them into a single, flat set of services:

`let icrc_token_canister = actor ("r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai") : ICRCTypes.TokenInterface and ICRCTypes.TokenInterfaceExtension;`

What's the correct syntax to achieve this?

I'm reluctant to create a single `ICRCTypes.JointTokenInterface` due to code repetition / interference with processes that use existing types like `ICRCTypes.TokenInterface`.

Maybe try parens around it?  I usually put the descriptor on the variable declaration side.

It may be that "and" typing doesn't work with function definitions.

`let icrc_token_canister = actor ("r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai") : (ICRCTypes.TokenInterface and ICRCTypes.TokenInterfaceExtension);`

worked marvels.
