Since a couple of weeks, when sending or receiving ICP with a Ledger Hardware Account that is connected to the NNS Frontend, every transaction appears 4 times. This is independent of the device I'm using to access the NNS UI and the transactions do not appear when checking the address using the dashboard.internetcomputer.org, so I assume there is a bug in the NNS Dapps.

Thanks for reporting this bug!

I've just worked on a fix which can be seen here - https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/678

This prevents the issue happening going forward.

But I'll need to make another code change to fix the existing data.

Both of these changes will hopefully get released next week.
