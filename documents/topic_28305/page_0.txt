**Introduction**
It all began during the buzz of Ordinals. We joined a hackathon, creating an MVP featuring ckBTC and Ordinals as collateral. Securing second place, we earned a $25k grant.

**Project highlights**
1.  Borrow and Lend ckBTC
2.  Ordinals, BRC-20 as Collateral
3.  Fast Transaction using ICP on Bitcoin L2
4.  Less Expensive transaction fee
5.  Quick Settlement

**Built with**
1. Front-end - Node js
2. Back-end Canister - Motoko
3. Middle-ware Node js
4. Bitcoin Full-node

**Status of the project**
We've achieved three milestones successfully and are poised for market entry post completion of the code audit process by the audit team.

congratulate! Finance is my area of focus and I hope to see the product as soon as possible.
Regarding staking, there may be more forms, such as pledging ckBTC to borrow stablecoins.
