I want to use canister for data storage. Our app has an independent database. We just need to keep a copy of app's data on canister. 
we plan to build a service to send web2 app's data to a message queue(ActiveMQ), and a canister service receives data from the message queue. I can not find a tool that streams data directly from a message queue to canister. Are there any developer who has stored web2 app's data on Canister and can share some experience?
