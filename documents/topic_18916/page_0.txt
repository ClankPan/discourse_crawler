@Manu @chepreghy @kpeacock Sers Is there any way to get our token balances to be at least displayed on the ledger live app (While transactions will still go through via the NNS)
btw, Is there any way we can hold NFTs on our NNS wallet itself without relying on third party wallets such as Plug?
Thanks and I look forward to a reply.
Cheers!
Ishaaq
