@Ciaran would a middle ground not be to make it extremely difficult to censor by making the thresholds extraordinarily high? 

There appears to be a false dichotomy drawn between off-chain and on-chain governance systems. It’s being posited that off-chain governance systems are immutable and unstoppable. But, of course, upgrades in btc and eth are possible through hard forks. So actually, if we want to be precise, Bitcoin and Eth are not immutable and unstoppable - it’s just that it’s extraordinarily difficult to push through changes as widespread coordination and convincing is involved in hard forks. The DAO hack is an example of that. 

Would it not be possible to similarly make certain things such as censorship similarly difficult on-chain? For example, the US Constitution is very difficult to change but it is possible, and as a result it hasn’t changed much. Perhaps for those things one would need a massive overwhelming majority, following would be disallowed, quadratic voting was introduced, etc. etc. 

Seems like an agreed NNS constitution could solve the issue. That’s effectively what btc and eth has. It’s called what it takes to get a hard fork done.

Many people were prosecuted for the audacity to hold that day’s equivalent of Bitcoin as a hedge against government. Nationwide mandate, in a large country.

So, if something like that happens again, the Foundation is for banning any Canister that facilitates the purchase of XAU by private individuals, yeah?
[/quote]

If something like that happened today, maybe, maybe not. (I'm in no position to speak for the Foundation.) But it would be entirely for technical + legal reasons, not because of any grand scheme to position the IC one way or the other.

What I don't understand though is your insistence on "what would the Foundation do about X". On the one hand you're arguing that the IC's governance model should actively and explicitly prevent moderation (although, as said I don't see how that's possible without making the protocol immutable). On the other you appear to be assuming that the Foundation will maintain control of the IC's governance indefinitely. (If not, what does it matter what the Foundation thinks about anything?)

It almost looks like you don't trust the claimed 99% of the community to fall on your side of the argument and need a higher authority to step in and enforce it instead.

Ciaran | 2021-12-12 13:28:18 UTC | #307

The majority actually rarely decides. This is especially the case when the majority interest is a collective action problem around a general goal (to provide a globally trusted platform) rather than a very specific one (to remove a piece of content you don't like).

Yes this is in fact what I'm actually arguing for. I'm not under the illusion that Ethereum and Bitcoin are shiny rocks we discovered in the ground :) They can be changed. In practice however, since they are so hard to change, the only consensus you'll ever get is for protocol changes. Ledger amendments simply aren't feasible. Why? Because as Vitalik laid out in his debates with Vlad Zamfir over this, if somebody uploads something bad to Ethereum, and it hard forks to remove it, it'll be uploaded again minutes later. So it's simply not feasible to police the platform for content you don't like at protocol level. Policing must happen at layers above.

Edit: I'm not arguing for an agreed constitution. If you have one, it'll devolve into bureaucracy precisely because of the situation I outlined above. And governments won't stand by and have some unaccountable non-state body making calls on these things. There's a snowball's chance in hell of that.

I don't believe providing a means to obfuscate traffic to allow for hosting of DMCA content should be on the agenda for _ICP_ 

... Being hosted in globally distributed _data centers_, if the country they are hosted in has a problem with the lack of transparency the whole server just gets yoinked.

Unless I'm missing something, if there's content a state actor doesn't like they in would navigate as a user of the service then see what internet addresses are serving the response and then go knocking at the data centers doors. 

The key difference with the plausible deniability aspect is that The Internet Computer nodes _host_ the content so baking in a way to shield the IP address would imo remove the plausible deniability which would in turn lead to nodes being pulled from locales? I think we should be focused on building up more deterministic decentralization that is best-achieved through complying with local laws where the nodes are hosted. This will also help us to build an image that will be trusted for DeFi and to compete directly with AWS where central control and censorship of ideas is starting to take root.

Badlands (hosted on consumer hardware and networks) would be the way to go for underground ideas... AI image / content recognition should probably still be implemented though and tweaked for categories that are voted to be restricted. I would say "disable access first, appeal/tweak later" is right for most circumstances regarding AI-based content moderation of the worst types of content.

My introduction to the internet computer was that the project is starting off centralized with a lot of power in Dfinity's hands. As I understand it, this trade-off was out of necessity to implement the scale of infrastructure and code that is required to see the project get going. The goal and trajectory is decentralization, but it is a process, not an event. So I am not discouraged that we have some centralized exposures at this point. I think we all want to get more decentralized, Dfinity included. It's in all of our interest to get to that point.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-12-14 04:29:09 UTC | #312

I am curious too if the community has any appetite for making some of the code governance more difficult to change than others. Right now, anything can be changed by a majority vote (50% +1), and with a minimum participation threshold of 3%. Should some aspects require a higher threshold? 

The NNS is here to stay (unless we vote it away? I don't think we could do that though). But perhaps we say that certain proposal types (like removing a canister) require a supermajority. What would be high enough? 2/3 (with a nod to the IC's byzantine fault tolerance)? or 3/4? Or 95%?

This doesn't solve the problem I'm afraid. Let's say you have it at 95%. Someone uploads something abhorrent that 99.9% agrees should be censored. There's a vote to take it down. It passes and is taken down. Then it's uploaded 1000 times in 1000 different places again. Do you have another 1000 votes? Dfinity's competitors know this rule. They'll exploit it and spam the network with stuff they know people will want to censor. Even without these inevitable attacks, the amount of stuff that'd be referred to the NNS would be enormous. You can't run an internet scale platform with direct shareholder voting on every single issue. It's completely not feasible. The responsibility for monitoring the network would have to be devolved to some entity if you want censorship at protocol level.

No one is proposing to do this long term. It is the only option now, but discussion on how to actuallyscale this -- from technical (e.g. blocking (re-)installation of canisters with some hash) to process (e.g. implement DMCA counter notifications without direct NNS involvement) -- would be more useful than restating the obvious.

No one wants "censorship at protocol level" but some of us do think that staying within the law has its benefits. Even later on, in a utopic world where the protocol would protect all participants (node operators, neuron holders) from liability, you would still need mechanisms to stay within the law (e.g. at the very least move content that is infinging / objectionable to a jurisdiction where it is not so). Else you'll just end up with zero nodes in the US or EU (due to copyright infringement), zero nodes in China (due to whatever the CCP wants), zero nodes in islamic countries (due to whatever cartoon) and so on.

Chanting "decentralized protocols are alegal" is not going to change reality, no matter how loud you scream,

Although on a second thought, it may actually be feasible. (Not great, by any stretch of the imagination, but feasible.) E.g. I'm pretty sure you could get 3% of neuron holders by voting power to spend 24 hours a day reviewing DMCA takedown notices if that meant doubling (or whatever) their governance rewards as compared to neuron holders not involved in it. At zero cost to the network (you'd be simply distributing the same rewards unevenly).

Quite the opposite, I'm afraid.

But let me make it simple for you: the HTTP protocol not being subject to law (which it isn't, really) by no means implies that I can put up an HTTP server serving whatever content my heart desires, I.e. we are talking about the network here, not the protocol.

Let me give you a hint: the reason why Bitcoin and Ethereum are (in practice) as censorship resistant as they are is the exact same reason why it takes hours and energy on the scale of a small atomic bomb to finalize a Bitcoin transaction; or tens of millions of dollars to store a pirated movie on Ethereum.

What do I not understand? The fact that there's no Bitcoin NNS? I'm pretty sure I do.

I believe it's you who does not understand that running the Bitcoin protocol on only 13 (or 4; or 35) publicly identified servers is materially different from running it on thousands of anonymous nodes. Which is also what makes it slow, inefficient and generally incredibly wasteful. (Same applies to Ethereum.)

I'm quite sure there would be no need for governance and anyone who cared could loudly claim the IC is somehow miraculously outside the law if it consisted of a single subnet replicated over thousands and thousands of Raspberry Pi instances. It would also be slow, inefficient and generally incredibly wasteful. Not to mention pointless.

Alin, the internet is a counter-example to this, let alone other web3 protocols that already work similarly (Arweave, IPFS, Holo, Filecoin). This may be tough to swallow, especially since you guys have been working on this for so long and you don't want to see your product enable bad things to happen, but the possibility that a protocol is used for illegal activity has to be there in order for it to truly be open, law enforcement will figure new ways to approach this new technology. Otherwise you're just left with a worse, closed version of the internet, or a worse version of Arweave.

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 13:35:01 UTC | #331

Question for @free.

iirc, each subnet is it's own blockchain. If we can increase the number of node providers in the system subnet to say 100+, could we require canisters operating within that subnet to be physically updated? This way 2/3 of the node providers would have to agree on the update to any canister and the remaining 1/3 would be forked? Seems something like that would allow us to "keep the protocol pure" while still allowing for NNS governance.

This way we'd be removing system subnet canisters, like the ledger canister, from the from the scope of NNS governance.

Edit: FWIW - I only bring this up because there was a past proposal to allow NNS node providers to vote on and push updates using the command-line interface. So it seems like we are already part way there

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-14 13:45:46 UTC | #332

I think decentralization often get's somehow confused with anarchy. Just because there is no central control organ doesn't mean the majority doesn't still have the power over the minority in some shape or form. Sure if your democratically elected government doesn't suit you, you have the option to leave the country or stay and pretend they don't exist(or start an uprising, as seems to be gaining popularity in some countries).

When Badlands? When everyone can finally have their rasberryPI to show off their independence just for the sake of it?

In the meantime, how to protect the IC in the best possible way from attacks of any kind, while interfering the least possible way?

roy23 | 2021-12-14 13:55:30 UTC | #334

While ideological issues are fought over, please don't forget that what we need most of all is adoption from non blockchain evangelists, and for them having a tool like the NNS to ban e.g. CP might be seen as a good thing.
Surely "We don't allow CP on our network" would send out a better message than "You can post CP here, because we're all so freedom loving"

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 13:58:10 UTC | #335

I do agree this needs to be considered. There is an entire world out there who has not subscribed to this philosophy and most of them will not be so easily convinced. And if the solution is to just tell them to "deal with it" then I'd argue we will have become just as tyrannical as the big institutions we are supposedly fighting against.

-------------------------

To be fair (and AFAICT, I may well be wrong) the other web3 protocols you mention are glorified Bittorrent alternatives. I'd be really surprised (not positively or negatively, just very surprised) if someone put together a Bittorrent alternative that made it impossible to publish illegal content.

But leaving that aside, it's not about me or my colleagues being particularly sensitive to the IC being used for "bad things". Remember that many of them (myself not included) actually come from the crypto community and they haven't given up on Ethereum (or whatever) and started working on the IC because they thought Ethereum was too open.

My point is simply that at this moment in the IC's evolution doing anything other than blocking / taking down illegal content just in order to allow a handful (or 99%, depending on who you believe) of people the pleasure of watching the world burn is not going to help in any way. Slippery slope arguments included. That's all there is to it. We can discuss where we want to be in a few years, how do we get there technically and what processes do we put in place until then. But an all or nothing approach will simply yield the latter, no matter how hard we close our eyes and wish for something different.

It's quite likely that given the strong arguments I've seen above (many of which are entirely valid and accurate; e.g. @Ciaran's observation that any amount of moderation encourages censorship) the IC will evolve towards openness and freedom. It is simply not there now. Some building blocks are missing (e.g. the kind of automation that would allow a node operator to black list a canister); and some are (based on current understanding) very much technically impossible (e.g. hiding the identity of nodes hosting a piece of content; how would you know where to get it from?).

As a parenthesis, law enforcement doesn't need new ways to approach this new technology. They have old, cheap, exceedingly effective ways to do it.

Possibly. But keep in mind these are the same node operators that will (often, not joking) insert the HSM key required to initialize a node before joining the network into the wrong machine and wiping out a healthy replica. Now imagine 2/3 of them getting something significantly more elaborate right once a week. Or, when things go south, within an hour of getting woken up at 2 AM.

Not saying it's a bad idea. It (like everything else) would just need a lot more work to get reliably right.

Edit: also note that putting the power to update the NNS into the hands of 100 node operators physically interacting with nodes; instead of 16K neuron holders virtually interacting with the NNS is not as huge a difference as it may seem. You can require an arbitrarily large proportion of votes to accept a proposal.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 14:05:32 UTC | #338

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 14:06:12 UTC | #339

It's not an ideological issue. It's a practical one. You're either decentralised and autonomous and get to play by the rules of decentralised autonomous procotols or you're not and you don't. If you don't, you must expect to be regulated for any regulated activity that happens on your system. It's as simple as that. I don't know how many more times I've to say it but it's a fact. 

This also goes with people's perspectives. Again I'm repeating myself but the penny doesn't seem to be dropping. HTTP allowed people to electronically send CP when they weren't able to before. Encryption allowed them to do this privately when they weren't able to before. Yet both those technologies are ubiquitous and people don't go "why don't the encryption algo writers stop all these criminals?!" They look elsewhere for the problem to be tackled.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 14:18:34 UTC | #340

So I've been meaning to follow-up with you on this discussion.

Let's put illegal content aside. If we can change the protocol to the point that no canister can be taken down without a phyiscal attack on the replicas then what prevents someone from uploading some sophisticated piece of malware? Maybe something that is actually doing physical harm by attacking control systems and other critical pieces of infrastructure? Mind you we are talking about a protocol that could be around for decades so this malware could be pretty advanced and is only constrained by the resources made available to it by the IC.

Edit: I shouldn't have said "what prevents them". The real question is how would we address this issue?

-------------------------

Question is whose penny. ;) Perhaps the penny of those who continuously fail to comprehend the fundamental difference between transport (protocol) and storage (server)?

You may argue that a protocol can be agnostic to the content it transports (although even that is debatable), but storing data to make it publicly accessible (no matter how obscured) is a different game. The IC is not just a transport protocol, it's designed to store large amounts of data, served by its nodes. And legal authorities routinely go after other servers serving illegal content in other networks (be it web, bittorrent, etc). And sometimes rightfully so, I may add.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 14:41:55 UTC | #343

I feel like I'm going crazy here as I'm corresponding with actual protocol devs but can anyone else here correct me if I'm wrong:

1. The IC is a protocol for securing data in a decentralised fashion via cryptography and economic incentives. 

2. Nodes that join the protocol provide storage services and play by protocol rules.   

If you want to make the NNS responsible for data, then 1. ultimately doesn't matter as The NNS decides. There are huge legal ramifications for this desire.

There is absolutely nothing in the IC Protocol specification that prevents CP. You could (modulo having to rewrite some of the crypto code, which IIUC is under a slightly more restrictive license) have an IC clone entirely dedicated to CP with zero other changes to the code.

There are significant differences between (1) HTTP, (2) Ethereum and (3) the IC. HTTP is essentially a wire protocol: these are the bytes you (as an entirely independent client) need to send to an (entirely indepentend) HTTP server to get a well-formatted response that is other than a closed connection or HTTP 400. Ethereum OTOH is a network, **with a state**. It's not like I can set up an independent Ethereum network clone on my laptop and have it interact with the public Ethereum network in any meaningful way. The reason why it's censorship resistant (by your definition) is (leaving aside the costs and the fact that it would be totally impractical to attempt copyright infringement via Ethereum) that there are thousands of identical anonymous nodes a majority of which couldn't be convinced to give a damn about copyright infingement until they were systematically taken off the internet by law enforcement. And law enforcement doesn't give a damn about taking down content from a network able to store GB of data (some of which may or may not be the record of an illegal financial transaction between what may or may not be shady parties).

The IC OTOH makes the attempt to provide a complete platform (not a decentralized ledger plus 10-line scripts; or a vaguely anonymized, distributed file system) that is powerful and cost efficient. So by necessity it cannot run on 10 year old hardware sitting in someone's basement (not in any way that would make it meaningfully different from the above); and it cannot replicate state across thousands of machines (without becoming Ethereum with HTTP support).

You can accept this or not, but your acceptance doesn't change anything about it.

I will point out again that there is no material difference between Ethereum limited to running on tens of publicly identified machines and the NNS with only node providers given voting rights. Or between Ethereum as is and an alternate reality IC consisting of a single subnet replicated across thousands of anonymous nodes. I.e. the difference does not lie in the protocol.

I very well understand the goal of The IC to serve things the other blockchains can't. 

The problem is tokenised open Web 3.0 dApps - the things Dominic keeps shouting from the rooftops The IC was specifically built for - aren't viable on a protocol with active governance of a ledger by humans. This is *especially* the case for governance by financial interests. States will absolutely not allow this. 

So if we're in a situation where the IC can't work without governance yet also can't work *with* governance then I ask the question do we have a viable project here? How is it going to work?

Right. Because everyone would rather hand over control to one CEO rather than a large group of people, or in your worst case, a group of competing nation states.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 15:12:37 UTC | #350

The CEO is answerable to shareholders. There's literally no difference. This is especially the case when governance load would require delegation or devolution. 

The point is moot anyway. Everyone won't be allowed to hand over control to a group of people. Governments are well aware of the history of finance and won't sit back and stay out of an impending disaster zone just because people quote new jargon at them to tell them "this time is different".

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 15:14:47 UTC | #351

Yet there is nothing to stop him/her from making unilateral decisions. Just because there could be repercussions does not negate the fact that control lies with one individual.

I will say again that I am very much convinced by the argument that any amount of moderation is an open invitation for censorship. And (maybe, although this is a bit of a stretch for me) that in an ideal world there would be no way to moderate content on the IC.

I'm just not convinced by taking those argument to the extreme, via claims that other networks can avoid moderation just fine, so (skipping a bunch of steps) the IC must also do it. Now.

On the one hand, as @rossberg has pointed out, there are significant differences between transport protocols and physical networks, with associated states. On the other hand, there is functionality that still needs to be implemented before we can meaningfully talk about taking any stance other than following the law to the letter. And on the other other hand (or third, if you're keeping count) I am personally still not convinced (although I would be happy to be proven wrong) that a network with the stated goals of the IC (performance and efficiency) can ever practically take a stance as radical as you are arguing for (because of the structure of the network required to make it fast and efficient).

So you have convinced me inasmuch as I honestly believe we should aim to get closer and closer to a state where the NNS doesn't need to intervene in any way in content moderation. Or change the state of the network. But partly because of where we stand now and partly because the IC is an incredibly complex beast as compared to literally anything else out there, I don't see how a hands-off approach could possibly work at all. If, as @LightningLad91 above pointed out, something goes south (and there are many ways in which it can and does right now) there is a big need for something like the NNS.

Looking at it from a different perspective, no one is going to take seriously a platform with continuous hour and day-long outages due to the fact that node operators USB drives in hand need to be involved in addressing each and every one of them. (Nor do I, as I've already said, see this to be materially different or in any way better than doing the same via the NNS.)

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 15:35:06 UTC | #353

Yes my point is the difference is the governance structures and the incentives they create.

LowFreeKey | 2021-12-14 15:47:28 UTC | #354

As others have highlighted there are several dimensions to this issue.

While a quick and pragmatic canister removal proposal would function as a short term solution this will have long term effects on the way courts handle node operators and perceive the IC as a whole.

Unfortunately legislators are for the most part responsive and wait for an issue to arise as we saw with the Old & Uber judgments. Let us not make the same mistake, this conversation is long overdue. Otherwise we give room to lots of speculation on the direction democracy and regulation will take within the IC.

In a sense it boils down to “who gets to” and “how” do we define the regulatory framework.

Echoing others, Node providers should benefit from the utmost legal protection. Prevention of their access to info of the cannisters they are hosting would aid in this, but I’m uncertain of the degree to which this can be done with 100% accuracy. Government should never be able to force the hand of a node provider or we’re back to square one.

Similarly our governance system should function as a sieve where greater actions and decisions are only required if the previous protections failed to apply. Before strictly defining what cannot be, we should take the time to suggest[ what content is encouraged](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/privacy-enhancing-technologies/israel-uk-privacy-and-technology-workshop-note.pdf?la=en-GB&hash=218915A3D5AA244D333A22D104882551).

A barebones version could look like this:

* Creation of any canister requires acknowledgement from the controller that “The intent of this canister is to serve as a useful tool or service which will benefit the greater community in at least one of many ways. I.e a)Social interaction b) entertainment c) building and creativity d) problem solving
* Canister controller is notified directly and given healthy timeframe to delete / remove contents related to claim

* A random sample of the community (with [voter reputation](https://future.a16z.com/reputation-based-systems/) not token amount!) is invited to serve as a “jury” where the claim made is compared to the canister in question. Strong majority could execute a canister removal motion.
* Canister controllers are given the opportunity to appeal the jury decision but must demonstrate substantial staking power to do so. As this greater appeal will take more time and attention from the community, those involved should be rewarded. An independent liquidity pool or the appellant will be the source of funds depending on the outcome. (Losing a case is always expensive there is currently no way around it)

The SNS may very much play a role further down the line before the “random sample” is called into question. Ultimately no matter the framework there will be quirks but it is crucial we lay the grounds now before we are blindsided by the next regulation/moderation case.

The NNS is here to stay (unless we vote it away? I don’t think we could do that though). But perhaps we say that certain proposal types (like removing a canister) require a supermajority. What would be high enough? 2/3 (with a nod to the IC’s byzantine fault tolerance)? or 3/4? Or 95%?

2/3 should do the job.  I think this would be a good step.

When it comes to discussion of changing the definition of Simple Majority and Absolute Majority for certain types of governance proposals, I think it is necessary to clarify if we are talking about majority of votes cast or majority of total voting power.  Simple Majority is defined in terms of votes cast, but Absolute Majority is defined in terms of total voting power.  

It is already exceedingly difficult to achieve Absolute Majority unless DF and ICA vote and they have recently proposed a motion ([NNS Proposal ID 34485 (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485)) to remove their default followee status for governance proposal.  That proposal passed yesterday (Dec 15, 2021).  Hence, it should soon be a very high bar to pass a governance proposal by Absolute Majority.  

DF and ICA are free to abstain from governance votes and they will likely do that on many proposals that they believe is a conflict of interest or inappropriate for them to vote.  If you look at the voting records for the last month or more, they have routinely abstained from voting on governance proposals.  Any vote that is not cast is effectively a vote to Reject based on the definition of Absolute Majority.  Hence, the votes to Adopt already have a higher bar than the votes to Reject simply due to the definition of Absolute Majority and the fact that everyone will not vote, even on really important proposals.  

Looking at the voting history, the proposals that received the highest total votes that were not decided by liquid democracy (in other words, DF and ICA did not vote) were the people party proposal and the cannister safe upgrade proposal with 47.5M and 47.9M votes, respectively.  These have been the most popular votes so far and this only amounts to 15% of total voting power that cast their votes.  Hence, it is already exceedingly difficult to pass a governance proposal by Absolute Majority.

I personally do not see a need to change the definition of Adopt or Reject at all on any type of proposal.  I like the fact that Simple Majority has a 3% minimum threshold of total voting power that must be met and there is a wait for quiet mechanism.  I think this is sufficient to decide any proposal.  To me the bigger question is whether or not certain types of proposals should be voted at all such as cannister removal.  I'm still on the fence about it.

Anyway, I think it is important to clearly define what is meant when talking about changing voting definitions.  It is unlikely that 100% of total voting power will vote on governance proposals in the future, so that might require recalibration of our thought process.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-12-16 00:49:36 UTC | #357

Excellent point about simple majority vs absolute majority. I was thinking the potential new thresholds would be with regards to simple majority.

You keep insisting on comparing the IC with glorified file sharing schemes. They are not at all similar. Even if you use pretty pictures to make your point.

Yes, the IC can store and serve static content. But it also does A LOT more. And node operators don't have any choice regarding what runs on their nodes. Nor can that content be arbitrarily moved around as is the case with file sharing (i.e. you can't remove a canister from one node on a subnet and have it run on the others).

Also, as a node provider with servers running in a third party's data center, you really-really don't have the "node keeps forwarding infringing content" option. There is no legal pursuit, your servers just get unplugged. Very anticlimactic.

To simplify your colorful chart a bit, this is how it works with IC nodes:

```
           Someone uploads infringing content
                            |
                            + <------------------------------------+

                            v                                      |

                            |                                      |

                                      v                            |

                                      v                            |

                                      +----------------------------+
```
I hope that's clear enough even if it's not (in either sense) a pretty picture.

In the case of the IC "node" would be "boundary node," their decentralization would render em legally autonomous. Added to that, some technical solution to make storage node operators unliable would be implemented, which would be what concerns your comment.

This is being discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-nodes-as-censors/9640) so please come over and ask about any real issues you may find with that solution, Harrison and Jordan are way smarter than me and I'm sure will be able to respond far better than I can.

As a side note, consider approaching ideas with a bit more charitability, if you want to keep engaging with me at least. Instead of saying "this can't be done, you're stupid and the IC is too complex for your solutions," ask yourself how a solution could be implemented, what the relevant abstractions in the idea are, etc. And we may both benefit from it.

I have to strongly disagree here with you. 3% is way too little for any decision with far reaching consequences like removing/blacklisting a canister or changing who controls a neuron (ongoing proposal). 
On the contrary, I believe at this stage Dfinintys hand should be forced on decisions like this. They might choose to wait for quiet, and follow a clear decision from the wider community (if any). But it will take a few years before the NNS, and IC for that matter, is decentralized enough to take Dfinity out of their responsibility to think long and hard about matters like these, and actually voice their opinion. If they can't come up with a clear opinion, maybe it's time to eat your own meds and let everyone vote internally if a highly controversial issue arises? After all, I still trust Dfinity to have the deepest knowledge of what has to be done in the interest of the whole network, that's why I choose to follow their neuron in the first place.

That's why I believe there has to be 50% of eligible votes cast, and a 2/3 majority for anything that has to do with neuron or canister ownership/control. 
For everything else status quo could be fine, I guess.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-16 15:52:20 UTC | #362

I think quorum should even be much higher than 50% with some sort of algorithmic adjustment downwards over many days if no proposal passes, then adjusted to that % but always floating back up unless a motion passes to adjust lower.

For example in the case of a global war where 80% of neurons/icp holders die and keys are lost. It would adjust downward over some days or weeks and allow the survivors to change quorum rules and redistribute new keys to heirs etc

[/quote]

It was not obvious that you were talking about boundary nodes. Technically speaking this could be done for boundary nodes without problems (or rather with few problems, II principals depend on the actual URL of the app, so if you access the same app via different boundary nodes you'd end up with different principals).

But it's quite possible that a determined copyright holder, who doesn't want to play whack-a-mole with what are basically proxies to content hosted on the IC, may end up going to the source of the problem and request that a specific IC node be taken down. Then the next, and the next. And I will point out that (a) which nodes host a given canister is public information; and (b) there is no way to hide that (if a boundary node can locate a canister, so can anyone else).

Meaning that this may be an interesting short-term solution, but unfortunately not a lot more than that.

As for node operators removing canisters from their nodes, that's not directly possible: a node is part of a subnet and all nodes on the subnet must execute the exact same messages on the exact same canisters. This is very different from a platform that stores static content: you can simply shard the content over a huge number of anonymous nodes, with none of them storing even a piece of the original content and require many of them to contribute in order to rebuild the original content. That way the content isn't located anywhere in particular (unless you consider 100 anonymous nodes that can be replaced at a moment's notice to be a location). You cannot do something like that with an application (which is what a canister is): you can't arbitrarily break it into tiny pieces spread across 100 nodes and still expect it to work in any meaningful way.

And here I am having spent yet another 15 minutes on the forum instead of doing one of the dozen things I still have to finish by tomorrow.

rubenhorne | 2021-12-16 22:31:28 UTC | #364

As far as voting to remove abilities such as ability to remove a canister, such a proposal could be a really good symbolic vote. Practically speaking though, we could always vote to give the ability back to ourselves. Not a bad way to but force us to address the question explicitly though.

As has been said many times in this thread, your utopian vision of “no content moderation” is impossible. The world’s governments will outlaw the entire ICP network. The network will have 0 users. We will all continue using Amazon Web Services. End of story.

Node operators need to be able to stop hosting content that is illegal in their jurisdiction. There is no alternative. You are talking as if governments cannot exert any power over network participants.

That's a silly comment. Of course they can. The world's governments could make it illegal to hold BTC or ETH, and to run nodes, at a moment's notice. They simply haven't done so as of now. Don't mistake a failure to legislate for the inability to legislate.

If governments enacted such a ban, the BTC and ETH networks would lose most of their users overnight, and most cryptocurrency exchanges would shut down. Most humans aren't trying to start a revolution.

Can storage subnets that are working the way you just described (every node only holds some piece of a file) solve this? You build your logic in an application subnet and store your data in a storage subnet. Performance wouldn't be great if you really intend on working on the data, but for static assets it could be a solution, right?

Maybe. But they would have to run a very different protocol from what subnets run now. Currently subnets (the gossip layer; consensus protocol; deterministic state machine; and so on and so forth) are explicitly designed to ensure that all replicas have fully identical states.

What you are proposing is essentially integrating the IC with IPFS. Which may turn out to be a more straightforward way of going at it. Not saying that implementing something similar to IPFS that's more closely integrated with the IC is impossible, just that it would be a lot of work. And likely not very high priority.

IMO I disagree with the entire notion that the community should be responsible for this. I propose that the original IC founders legal council could propose a document on the official position and process on dealing with ip theft, piracy and other illegal activity on the network that could go to vote. The language could be improved and we could try again until it passes. If this is continuously voted down by the foundations large power and concerned investors, at least the position in this issue is clear before others yolo join the 8 year gang.

Asking the community to come up with the perfect legal language along with associated processes for this is not our expertise and should not be the communities responsibility. We all come from different countries with different rules and have different backgrounds, and so our convo's just keep going in a loop, as there is no perfect solution. The original position, legal language and process to deal with inevitable problems needs to come from the responsible founders to protect themselves and the network, just like IPFS has done (https://ipfs.io/legal). Then the community will figure out how to make the solution as open and tolerable as possible. 

If this does not happen, then it seems to me like they are planning blame to us as investors down the road when something goes wrong, which is not acceptable. Each one if us deserves to know what we are investing our time/money in, if we are unknowingly indirectly supporting such activity, and if we will be down the road after we have already built our castles in the sandbox.

The Foundation and its representatives are the ones who have:

1) Built the protocol and network stack while making several explicit claims about objectives regarding censorship resistance (in ways that will likely be proven to be bald-faced lies within the next few years, regarding a few specific things Dominic has said).

2) Taken on the position of implementing the directives agreed upon by the community.

-- I ask "what the Foundation will do" because I have the viewpoint that when push comes to shove, there's a good chance the Foundation will just go rogue and do what the Foundation wants to do if a vote comes in that the Foundation doesn't like.

Regarding this idea of "technical + legal reasons, not because of any grand scheme" -- that's all taken care of, where things are headed governments will end up deciding how to position the ICP now and dictate whichever schemes you shall follow.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-25 06:30:33 UTC | #374

Manu's idea about a market for node providers to bid on which canisters to host would be moderation via the market. 

I'll say it again, though, and I understand this isn't really an area that you're responsible for/you might not even be aware of it -- one of the more striking things regarding this whole deal is that Dominic has been running around presenting the IC in a very very very different light with regards to censorship resistance than a lot of the sentiment (and proposed actions/policies) that I've seen coming out of the Foundation.

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-26 18:05:53 UTC | #375

@MisterSignal I expect the foundation to be evaluating these ideas, I wouldn't say they've shown dishonesty so far despite many members of the foundation having what I would call a confused vision for the platform, and Dom's character is just an enigma to me. However I'm not sure that the sense of urgency that this issue should prompt is there and it should become evident what their priorities are soon enough, I'm not sure how this would go forward either but I agree with expecting the foundation to have some sort of initiative, the community alone can't have much of an initiative here other than discussing ideas in the forums since what seems to be the most sensible path forward involves some changes that only the foundation has the power to effect at this early stage and it probably requires some technical thinking on their side to see how to implement these ideas.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-26 20:54:50 UTC | #376

Two quick things:

1 - I would say one of the main issues is that, aside from the confusion these statements cause, they can be very well be *interpreted as dishonesty* by various parties. I mean, you just can't have the CEO of the Foundation out there saying things like "UniSwap just had to delist a bunch of tokens...that would never happen on the IC!", while at the same time people in the Foundation are saying that it's very possible for UniSwap to be censored on the IC if various tokens on the DEX get declared as illegal securities, etc...

There's a reason that many executives in publically traded companies don't play so fast and loose with their words. 

2 - The reason I do classify some of these things as dishonest is because I have seen at least one instance of where Dominic was on a very public, in-person interview panel and he was asked about the problem of objectionable content on the IC and the plans to deal with it, and he deliberately avoided the question and became very uncomfortable even addressing the issue. 

This was *several years ago*.

Then, @alexa.smith comes on here and presents the issue as a "new question" -- I have first-hand knowledge from speaking with a team member several months before this Nintendo thing that the Foundation has been putting resources into how to handle these problems for quite some time now. 

-- It's the doublespeak and outdated PR tactics that piss me off, because DFINITY is so experienced and talented with such deep domain expertise in so many technical aspects that I don't think they *need* to actually do that kind of stuff. Leave that to inferior projects.

I don't understand how to solve the issue of language barriers unless everyone decides to learn some more languages. Language is always going to exclude participation, this problem is not unique to the Internet Computer. Even if a chinese forum were started, it would still require lots of translation for the team members to be involved.

If node operators didn't know what subnets their nodes contributed to, then they have even less plausible deniability and chances of node collusion plummets.
