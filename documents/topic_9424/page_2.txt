The continuum of action discussed yesterday ranged from hands-off to intervening. For many, the hands-off approach is unpalatable when one contemplates the most harmful content being dropped on the IC. Others fear intervention opens the pandoras box to influence by external entities and unsustainable bureaucracy.

We listen to the arguments of others with our own filters.  What I thought was an expression of a libertarian perspective may have been an impassioned defence of social scalability.  (https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html).  

This discussion has been fascinating.

Pathfinding how and how far any of such will fit into existing traditional jurisdictions is a non-trivial exercise we all have still to figure out. There is no single juridical system on this planet that a-priori trumps all others. 

Yet, there are pluralistic liberal values that many (most?) of us want to see reflected in the way this whole thing is governed. This specific case is but (one of) the first nudges for the involved community and perhaps local countries legal frameworks to put effort into governing such things "right and just" in ways where there is little to no precedent on doing it globally. 

Perhaps down the road there is a case for forming an WHO/WTO like governance organisation that decides and articulates on legal principles for interfacing with on-chain governance rules and rule changes that local legislation commits to reflect, adhere to or respect. 

For the moment, the DFINITY Foundation necessarily holds dominant voting power to be in a position to if necessary undemocratically correct unfolding developments when they go wrong. Abstaining from voting in this particular case is an important step to mature the communities perspective on not only the particular the problem at hand, but the class of problems where there are no off-the-shelf answers available for yet in a global, de-centralised system that down the road will have to interface with local jurisdictions around the globe one way or the other. It will happen by design, by accident, depending on the local legal system by decree, precedence or derived from roman law principles. 

Letting us all figure this out in this specific (first) case by ourselves like teaching a kid you raise to own the consequence of its own decision is what we as a community are going through with this initial conversation. It is massively relevant to our growing up and mature as a community that over time will entirely have to self-govern itself through the NNS. As as with kids, many of the ideas and thoughts coming up are still understandably immature and rooted in the limited perspective of the world we know until now, not the world that we are growing up towards, yet.

I hope I don't come across as too bitter here, but having spent the last 2 years of my life working 12+ hour days on the IC (alongside people who have been doing it for much longer) I find many of the opinions expressed here incredibly entitled.

Yes, the IC should be able to eventually do pretty much all that the above posters expect from it. Eventually. (Whether much of it is a good idea or not, is a completely separate issue.) But right now we don't even have the possibility to move a canister from one subnet to another; or run within encrypted enclaves; or allow node providers any freedom to choose what should and should not run on their nodes. All of the above above and more is still being worked on at a rate of well over 12 hours per person per day. And honest-to-God efforts are being made to allow the community to actively contribute to it all (via proposals, code and whatever else).

But as many have already pointed out, attitudes like "if the IC doesn't do this now, then it is dead to me" or "this is no different from AWS, except slower", with an implied expectation that things need to change here and now to allow for unfettered freedom on the IC are, to put it mildly, unhelpful.

There are things that can be done today (e.g. decide how to handle obvious IP infringement, so there isn't a big argument every time it happens). And there are things that can be considered for the future and introduced gradually, as protocol evolution allows. It's just reality, not any oligarchic plot to turn the IC into Web 2.0 on steroids. E.g. there is no reasonable way (given the currently implemented capabilities of the IC) for a node operator to protect themselves against a legal DMCA request that is not acted on by the NNS. And the community (via the NNS) making a public statement that IP is old school and the IC is alegal is not going to help their argument.

Disclaimer: personal opinion and all that.

A few posts later in this thread you indicate that you will exit participation in this debate.  I would like to encourage you to remain engaged.  You bring a valuable perspective.  I’m not sure I agree with everything you have written yet, but this particular comment was a turning point for me in understanding your perspective.  I think you are bringing intellectually honest contributions that need to be part of the conversation.

i think the idea of allowing canisters to move and perhaps establishing a free bid/ask market for canisters and node operators to participate in would be ideal.  in that case a node operator in a jurisdiction where they could not be sued, or where the possible liability is very limited could bid low prices on "bad" canisters and ones which are in other jurisdictions could put in higher bids.  canisters could just run on any node initially, and with the ability of the node operator to kick them to the market if and when they receive some legal notice and make a business decision that they don't want to deal with that particular client.

for example, canisters which offer gambling would want to be hosted on nodes in gambling friendly jurisdictions.

free market is the way to go on this jmho. of course if the canister is running something that is an assassination market it's possible that no node op would place an offer on the market and the canister would be SOL.

@ajismyid , what about Sci-hub ? For me, it is a major example of revolutionary content that The IC should host and stand for. It is about Science made available to everyone, with no cost-barrier. It has been revolutionary in web2.0, and we should let it be revolutionary in web3.0. If we bend to big-corps, Scihub would never exist in The IC. Is that what we want? ( Just for context, scientists are usually supported by public money. Scientific results go published in Refereed Journals. Scientists act as invited referees (and gain no money for that). Scientists have to find ways to get funding and pay for publication fees (that goes from 100-200 $USD per page). After the work is published, the editor charge readers a fee of 30-100 $USD per paper! Can you imagine that? Fee over fee. And if you can't pay, you can't read and access the scientific results (even though it has been financed -mostly- with public money). 

Scihub is revolutionary because it goes against that. It takes the scientific papers, hosts them in stealth servers, and anyone can get any scientific work, for free. It has created a huge counter-move from scientific editors worldwide. But still, the -editor industry- want to keep enforcing the old model. Charge for publishing, and charge for reading (while using established scientists as free referee-labor-force). 

The IC could host Scihub. And editors would try to put down our Scihub canisters. Are we going to let that happen?

Thanks for your perspective! It's way too easy to get hung up on ideological views while forgetting about the reality we are facing right now. Good to have this vision of ultimate freedom but important to keep in mind that it will be a long road and trying to take the path of most resistance is unlikely to get us there.

On a side note: My understanding is that the NNS, being pretty much the shareholders voice, is exactly meant to be able to make decisions like that, where the success of the project will most likely be the common denominator and decisions are made accordingly. It's impossible to please everybody, but as long as we can agree, through voting, what are the best decisions for the IC to succeed, I don't really see an issue here. 
On the contrary, Dfinity announcing they won't vote and let other shareholders/participants make up their minds was a huge step in showing everybody that they are ready to listen to everyone regardless of what they think/know to be best for the overall success of the IC. So more than everything I'm encouraged we are on the right path here. keep up the good work!

Once again, we can satisfy everyone with varying content moderation of subnets. Some subnets could remove IP infringements, some just remove CP, some remove nothing. 

We could have "Moderation Groups" that consist of moderator neurons and subnets they moderate. Each group posts an acceptable use policy (or none).

Then we let the node providers decide what legal risk to take based on their location (and morals). @Ciaran can run his moderation-free nodes from a boat in international waters where he is free from prison risk if someone uploads CP.

@Ciaran said "That’s exactly what people said about Bitcoin in 2012."

No, the IC is entirely different because of its capabilities. It is not economically feasible to host content more than a few MB on existing chains. The IC opens up much broader possibilities of copyright infringement and morally controversial content. And because the nodes need data centers, it is much easier for people to point fingers at node providers as "responsible" for the content they serve to clients. At the end of the day it comes down to what a non-technical judge/jury can be convinced of.

However, in theory, Bitcoin could face the same problem. Someone could spend millions uploading CP to the Bitcoin blockchain that would be then hosted on every node for people to download. If this happened, governments would be faced with an outraged populace demanding a solution. It could end up with legal consequences for Bitcoin node operators, effectively banning nodes in many countries, and severely degrading the performance of the network and disenfranchising many users. We would likely see a fork of Bitcoin that removed the offending blocks gain popularity, a form of meta-governance. Amidst all the chaos, networks that have built-in governance to avoid such disruption will thrive.

In my opinion only canisters that host content that can endanger other people's lives such as: hitman services, pedopornographic content, weapon marketplaces, etc... should be taken down, not only due to moral reasons but also cause the infraction is evident, a picture either is CP or isn't.

DMCA on the other hand is much more complex and thats why claims are escalated in court if necessary, the NNS doesnt have the manpower to handle the whole internet's DMCA claims, just a few days ago a YT channel had 120 videos wrongfully taken down due to DMCA, I dont want to experience this on web 3.0 and I'd rather have thousand of pirated content hosted on the IC than IP owners abusing their rights.

Its clear tho that as of now if things worked like I wish node operators would have legals issues and the IC would suffer as a result, so I think the foundation should prioritize systems to remove legal liability from node operators.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 16:40:47 UTC | #216

I've only walked away as I don't feel like I've anything more I can say on the issue really. I'm just absolutely convinced - from history (liberty reserve, e-gold) and present day actions against governed DeFi apps - that the only way to provide a Web 3.0 platform that can actually function as a Web 3.0 platform is by being autonomous and pushing politics up to the nation state and app layers. 

The protocol, like HTTP, needs to remain completely agnostic to who uses it or what it's used for, or it will otherwise be sucked back into a Web 2.0 structure. If you have the power to remove a copyrighted piece of work, you have the power to alter account balances. If you have the power to alter account balances, *even if* you don't use that power, you're a money transmitter in every jurisdiction on the planet. You'd almost certainly also be a publisher because you can curate content - note there's a movement to revoke Section 230 in the US right now. If you're registered as a money transmitter and also deemed a publisher all the clever cryptography and consenus mechanisms you invented don't matter a jot. Nation state rules rather than economic consensus rules the roost. 

This situation simply does not apply to Bitcoin, Ethereum, TOR and BitTorrent and it's precisely why they've survived outside of regulated structures. States treat them like the treat HTTP: Something that just is so they pursue their policy goals in ways that don't involve tampering with how they work. This is the difference between decentralised protocols and those that merely have a veil of decentralisation. 

As I said I'm not sure what else I can say to convince people of this reality but it is the reality. 

Actually there's one more thing I could say that I haven't. Apart from opening up a pathway for governments to override the consensus mechanism to the point it becomes meaningless, it's not as if active censorship would materially affect (for example) the amount of child porn on The IC. It'd be whack-a-mole just like it is now. The powers that be will find it much more fruitful operating like they do now and setting up honeypots (L.E. actually uploads CP to catch criminals remember) to catch these scumbags. 

When somebody uploads CP to the internet now, nobody goes "look what you've done Tim Berners-Lee! You're letting paedos get away with this!" They correctly blame the people that did it in the knowledge TBL's invention is general purpose. I strongly advocate decentralising The IC to the point it's completely agnostic and people view it like they view HTTP and it's a given that criminals are pursued outside the protocol. CP won't disappear. It never will. But it will be pushed off the mainstream apps on The IC (which I assume will be moderated by DAOs) and into the dark corners where 99.9% of people don't frequent. By pushing the scumbags to those corners, L.E. can isolate them and have success in catching them. 

I get the impression many here think I'm some crazy libertarian. I'm not at all. I'm merely a pragmatist that understands there's only two ways a network can be administered. 1. Autonomous constraints on power (Web 3.0) or 2. By plugging into nation state rules with its separation of powers and legal systems that also constrain power. I think it's a fantasy to think there's a middle ground where you can choose to follow 1 some of the time and 2 some of the time.

Appreciate all the work you have done and are doing. The IC is undoubtedly a technical marvel, albeit one rapidly developing rather than available in anything like a finished form. I can understand why some of the discussion might have felt unfair to you and your colleagues. However, we on the outside have been exposed less to the innards of Dfinity's functioning than to the way it has been marketed. A central plank of that marketing has been that, unlike AWS, it is censorship resistant. While the present case might not seem related to censorship, it actually is, because a barrage of DMCA demands are commonly used  as a silencing tactic by authoritarian regimes. Dfinity's response to the notice seemed immature: the idea that we immediately go for a vote without getting details of the complaint. Obviously, we can't have such votes each time some node providers gets a DMCA demand. The knee-jerk response suggested the organisation had given insufficient thought to what is bound to be a common stumbling block for any expanding network. That, in turn, left the entire claim of being censorship-resistant in question.  Maybe that's a very entitled viewpoint, but I and most others staked a portion of our assets in the belief that Dfinity had thought these things through thoroughly, and I have seen little evidence of that being the case during the ongoing discussion.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 16:34:20 UTC | #218

I gather from some of the quotes that this is partly aimed at me. I've made no demands for technical fixes to be magically conjured up. I've said nothing derogatory about the technical work that's been done, I have in fact only complimented it. 

I'm taking aim at a culture, a philosophy that thinks it's a viable strategy to actively moderate The IC ledger. This culture is an existential threat to the technical achievements you guys have made. I think the philosophy is delusional and the protocol will simply be forced to devolve back into a Web 2.0 structure. That's what I mean by "have fun reinventing Web 2.0". It's a not an attack on developers. 

Having read that blogpost that Dominic wrote about The NNS, I do see that that culture hasn't come from nowhere though. So I'm assuming there is widespread buy in to this culture at the highest levels in Dfinity. I'm merely here exercising my voice trying to engender a shift in thought. I'm sorry if you personally feel attacked.

Yes, because on the Web, it is perfectly possible to remove such contents from a web site again, such that it can no longer be accessed. You are arguing for depriving the IC of that possibility entirely, which would create a completely different situation.

This is super insightful...thanks for coming back and contributing.  I **think** you will find consensus that what you are describing is an IC that we all want to exist...as @free has pointed out...we aren't there yet.  Let's keep moving forward.  I want an enclave-base, node-blinded, with node shuffling that 'just works'.  If we all push forward and build together we will get there.

The caveat here is enterprise and how quickly we want to penetrate that market.  They say they won't deploy to an environment that can host CP, but yet they are all deployed on the Internet. I think this example backs your point.  Until we can put the pure P in ICP, if we want to make inroads into the broader market we may have to do some specific governance.

"When somebody uploads CP to the internet now, nobody goes “look what you’ve done Tim Berners-Lee! You’re letting paedos get away with this!” They correctly blame the people that did it"

OK. I challenge you to stand up a public file sharing server in North America or Europe, advertise it to the world, wait for someone up upload CP, and keep the server running for as long as possible. Are you sure you won't get any blame by criminal justice systems? If we force node providers into this dilemma, we wont have any node providers.

Just imagine a node provider in court.

Judge: "So, I can open your server in my web browser, and your server, which hosts CP, will send CP to me?"

NP: "Yes, but sir its a decentralized network"

Judge: "But you have the option not to run the node, correct?"

NP: "...yes"

Jury: "Guilty."

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 16:33:41 UTC | #222

Thanks but my big worry from hearing attitudes on this forum is that's not where we all want to get to. I also worry that if we introduce short term moderation while we wait on technical improvements to protect nodes we'll never let go of it. "There's nothing more permanent than a a temporary government program" ,etc, etc.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 16:39:58 UTC | #223

Sigh, this is why I originally gave up. I keep getting strawmanned.

.....I'm obviously talking about structuring and decentralising the network to the point node providers aren't put in this position. As a member of the team has chimed in to state, this is going to happen.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 16:52:17 UTC | #224

Yeah, I wish we could have complete plausible deniability and not worry about node providers legal risk.

But I havent seen a proposal that completely gives plausible deniability. Even with secure enclaves and shuffling, if data is publicly accessible, nodes can find out they are hosting it (network traffic, logs, etc). We dont know whether courts will absolve nodes of responsibility with those hurdles. And it will be a long time before shuffling and secure enclaves are implemented. In the meantime nodes bear the full risk.

I would like to know what you think about having per-subnet content moderation and give node providers the choice of which ones to host, rather than forcing node providers into an all-or-nothing situation. If content moderation devolves into a shitstorm as you predict, the free market will run all the apps in the non-moderated subnets. If the ability to locate nodes in US data centers is crucially important, apps will trade censor risk for latency.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-09 17:03:21 UTC | #225

I think the main difference here is that the IC isn't merely a protocol. Once you get into hosting content things drastically change. The link of Vitaliks take on this is actually exactly what folks are discussing (e.g. peoples parties). There is no easy solution for this and while your principal ideas might be good the question remains: How to deal with a situation like this if not through the NNS? Just let the node operator handle it? What's your practical approach? Theories are all good but right now it's all about pragmatism imo. Should boundary nodes be left out in the rain with this?

Btw thanks for your input and don't take it personal I'm always happy to discuss and always eager to learn and try to see different perspectives. And just to let you know, my technical knowledge is mediocre at best but not so much my knowledge of politics/philosophy/psychology and therefore different forms of governance. It is actually the possibilities I see in this respect that has drawn me to the IC. Right now it's a purely capitalistic system and doesn't have much to do with democracy at all. Still personally I think we are on the right track but still have a long and bumpy road ahead. I find people expect way too much, while being inpatient.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 18:05:53 UTC | #226

Yes but the point is nobody holds TBL responsible for inventing someone that allows people to permissionlessly send CP. Nobody holds writers of encryption algos responsible for people being able to be hide what they're sending (further increasing people's ability to permissionlessly send CP). I want to get to a point where nobody holds people responsible for building or participating in a protocol that enables people to permissionlessly store CP. 

It goes back to the trade off I spoke of in my first post. Technologies like HTTP, encryption and The IC cannot exist to help *everyone* as much as they do if bad people don't also benefit from them. If we put a backdoor in encryption to try find people sending CP, we ruin that particular technology for everyone. I'm trying to get the point across - with some difficulty! - that the same principle applies here with governance and The IC. You won't be able to have truly open internet and financial services if you have active ledger governance. Of that I am convinced.

Per subnet moderation is just kicking the problem I'm talking about to the subnets. They'll be deemed MSBs and publishers and god knows what else depending on what activity they host. It's not sustainable either. We need technical solutions that absolve node holders of liability much like miners and stakers in other networks are absolved of being MSBs.

rossberg | 2021-12-09 18:22:28 UTC | #229

Radical and maximalist demands are cheap, as long as you can ignore reality. I would be interested in hearing an actual practical suggestion for solving the very real dilemma we (more specifically, node providers) face. You have evaded any answer to that so far, or decried it as strawman.

::original post deleted in error:: 

You make a fair point, but once is once, which makes it a fact. In considering this fact, it is useful to contextualise the time during which it happened. Specifically that there was little to no knowledge and oversight of the crypto sector from established cultural institutions. Today, things have changed, for example, [Binance ordered by London High Court to track the hackers behind the $2.6 million crypto heist | Currency News | Financial and Business News | Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/binance-london-court-track-hackers-2-6-million-cryptocurrency-heist-2021-8) , and they will continue to change.

The challenge presented to the community by @alexa.smith is not an opportunity to sling opinions, but to propose solutions.

TBH, I am surprised that those advocating minimal interference are not referencing the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s excellent work, specifically their work around [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act | Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) Speaking of whom, I don’t believe the EFF ever suggested people’s copyrighted material should be a secondary concern to hardware hosts’ Rights.

@alexa.smith I’d like to suggest this issue is not a new one and there are plenty of people and organisations with a wealth of experience who can help.Can we get some input from Amnesty International, the EFF, WikiLeaks, etc?

-------------------------

Rsl_033 | 2021-12-09 18:50:41 UTC | #231

I agree. But the courts of any jurisdiction are going to want to impose the justified claims of their plaintiffs, and those plaintiffs will include governments, and we still have to live in a jurisdiction with the potential for extradition. Ultimately we are subject to whichever power bloc controls our physical location. Agreeing that a legal request from a court will return information that satisfies that court is a pre-requisite for a business operating in their territory. Look at RIM/Blackberry for an example of a company that was identified and then (effectively) destroyed because it was too good at user security.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 18:52:32 UTC | #232

Tor Exit Node operators have faced legal repercussions even though they have no ability to control traffic. Just because you remove the ability to delete canisters doesn’t mean the legal system throws up its hands in defeat. If you’re all about freedom then why are you against node operators having the freedom to choose legally compliant subnets?

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 19:08:55 UTC | #233

What are my radical and maximalist demands exactly? To me expecting to administer an internet platform through coin voting yet avoid regulatory oversight when it aims to secure billions in value and a lot of other important information is radical to the point of being insane. 

There have been numerous solutions put forward (eg node shuffling, secure enclaves, onion routing). @free has acknowledged them and intonated that they're in the roadmap. They're obviously long term. 

I'm assuming short term it's hoped governance can fill the gap. As I said above, I'm not here to demand immediate technical fixes, I'm here to point out that what is obvioue to me: Governance of the ledger is completely unsustainable if it is to remain open. I'm shocked that this seems like news to people. I'm shocked the protocol was launched with the explicit aim of being open and censorship resistant yet structured as to leave node operators on the hilt for anything that's hosted on the network.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 19:06:01 UTC | #234

Go for it. Watch them be captured by regulators because of the power they will wield. Watch the consensus mechanism become pointless.

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 19:26:28 UTC | #236

I keep getting thrown off by your use of "consensus mechanism" so can you clear that up for me?

Its my understanding that the actual consensus that takes place with ledger transactions is separate from the NNS governance process. I understand the existence of this specific type of proposal (remove canister) is being questioned. But the distributed notary process between nodes on a subnet is not your issue right?

-------------------------

Rsl_033 | 2021-12-09 19:36:50 UTC | #237

I think that's a discussion that should be done under the trees we should have planted a decade ago, but Genesis has already happened. I can think of how the challenges of Governance vs censorship resistance can be (or is being) met in favor of resistance, but it's the kind of solution that I would not discuss on an open forum. I would rather be pleasantly surprised at some future point and in the meantime remain in blissful ignorance.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 19:37:41 UTC | #238

Yes the consensus mechanism is the autonomous part. It's what *should* allow open internet services. If it keeps getting overridden by a bureacracy implementing nation state rules, states will quickly realise that the consensus mechanism actually doesn't provide any security at all and therefore they will be forced to regulate the administrators. At that point you've just reverted to the current system. This doesn't happen on Ethereum because the consensus mechanism is king. It never gets overridden.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 19:43:10 UTC | #239

How do you figure the consensus mechanism is being overridden here?

Would love to get @Manu input on this because if that's really your concern then that goes well beyond this censorship debate.

There have been numerous solutions put forward (eg node shuffling, secure enclaves, onion routing). @free has acknowledged them and intonated that they’re in the roadmap. They’re obviously long term.
[/quote]

They are on the roadmap, yes.

But as others pointed out above, expecting that the judiciary system is just going to throw up their arms and give up simply because it is somewhat difficult to point to the exact machine providing a piece of content is naive in the extreme.

And if you are concerned that governments (or big money, or whatever) may take over the NNS and impose their will on what gets censored and what doesn't; and think that limiting the NNS to protocol specific changes is the solution; then that's also naive: adding back a "remove canister" proposal to the NNS is also merely a protocol change. So if "the bad guys" get control of the NNS all bets are off regardless.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 19:50:13 UTC | #241

Over-riding consensus mechanism/censorship/moderation = same thing.

-------------------------

free | 2021-12-09 19:52:34 UTC | #242

I believe the point is that NNS proposals can be used to make changes to canister states, changes that were not encoded in the canister. I.e. "code is law" turns into "code is law except if the NNS says otherwise".

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 19:55:58 UTC | #243

What do you propose we do with the existing node providers whom invested $$ into hardware and face real legal risk today? We just abandon them for idealism? Who is going to invest in running nodes in your anarchic vision for the network?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 20:02:18 UTC | #244

But that's how it has been since genesis right? Removing the ability to "remove canister" isn't going to change the way governance works. If that's the problem then wouldn't we need to remove or completely overhaul the NNS?

Edit: Just read your previous reply to Ciaran; i think that was the point you made. Thanks.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 19:59:41 UTC | #245

The judiciary system can only punish liability. Someone has to be liable. Not a single court in a single country has found anyone participating in securing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks to be liable for TXs on those protocols. 

If those things are on the roadmap the same might apply to The IC. If we can't build The IC in a way where network participants aren't liable, then it simply won't work as a Web 3.0 platform IMO. It can't be autonomous and thus must be regulated. 

FWIW I'm suggesting limiting the NNS to *no* ledger changes. I'm quite aware that that is probably heresy but it's clear that the three letter agencies are coming for networks that are governed.

Bitcoin or Ethereum can’t serve illegal content like the IC. No one can upload a copyrighted video to Ethereum, because it would cost millions. We are dealing with an entirely different beast with the IC. If you want to put your ass on the line and run an IC node with illegal content, go ahead and see how much legal defense costs.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 20:03:28 UTC | #248

Yes they can. And do. All the time. (illegal payments that is)

-------------------------

free | 2021-12-09 20:04:25 UTC | #249

It's not so much that it's heresy, but as long as you can change the protocol you can change the state. Period. There are no two ways about it.

The alternative is to have a finished, immutable protocol, with no possibility of making changes to it. That's where Bitcoin and Ethereum's perceived advantages come from.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 20:05:03 UTC | #250

The courts will see computing transactions and serving illegal data to clients differently. Transactions and content are different in the eyes of the law. Furthermore this has yet to be tried in court, yet you somehow know how any legal challenge would play out?

[/quote]

I'll make a distinction here....ETH and BTC are "anrchic" by *design*.  The longest chain wins and everyone has an ~equal chance of making the next block.  This takes consensus out of any one jurisdiction and distributes it across the network.  POS will change this a bit for ETH, but they are still just picking the next block....and once a block is in, it isn't coming out.  Node runners invest in and run nodes when they think they have an economic advantage to doing so.

The NNS is operating under a very different context where "we" the token holders can spin some dials and take blocks out.  Was that a good design?  I think some are contending that it wasn't and that that kind of on-chain governance muddies the waters.  Now you can build a canister that has a 'blockchain' in it and that doesn't work if you break the state...but if you can replace the whole canister....you are right back at square one. 

There may be an IC out there, run by node providers that is a forward-only version.  Does that fix the issue?  I don't know...just throwing out ideas here.  The NNS gives us a ton of power and responsibility...which is great...unless all you want to do is throw up a blog.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 20:07:48 UTC | #252

Well you can do upgrades by hard forks right? It means nobody is forced to follow the new version. And that, IMO, is key.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 20:09:48 UTC | #253

Oh come on after 10 years of blockchains with numerous court cases involving Bitcoin it has never once been even mooted that network participants were in any way liable.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 20:10:39 UTC | #254

Fork the IC, take out NNS, then see who is willing to run nodes. The difference with ETH/BTC is that no one has tried to upload copyrighted content as those networks were not built to serve files. If they were, I guarantee their node providers would start ending up in legal battles over DMCA notices.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 20:12:17 UTC | #255

Dude, what do you not understand about this specific issue of serving illegal data not being a thing on those blockchains? Please show me where I can download a copyrighted video off the Bitcoin blockchain.

Breaking the law is breaking the law. The courts don't pick and choose what parts of the law to enforce. That's my point. You're just arbitrarily suggesting copyright infractions on decentralised systems will fall foul of the courts when criminal payments on Bitcoin don't. Of course the reality is states give *way* more of a shit about AML than they do copyright so your logic doesn't make sense to me at all.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 20:26:16 UTC | #258

Just because one law has been tried in court doesn’t mean all laws have been tried in court. No one has tried to bring a DMCA case against a blockchain node provider before, because such data hosting was not possible before. If you believe otherwise, put your own ass on the line and run a node with copyrighted content. But don’t force everyone else to take that risk.

-------------------------

gecko | 2021-12-09 20:40:05 UTC | #259

This is by far one of the most important discussions for IC. and i personally don't believe the censorship and lack of decentralisation will help the project.

when I mentions *Censorship* - *resistance* i expect the following definition to apply : 
The property of a cryptocurrency network that prevents **any** entity from altering transactions on it.
this is not what happened with this proposal.

Currently IC has abt 400 nodes, and they "aim for 600 more to come" all of the nodes and partecipants are KYC'd and process to become a node is tedious and very complicated. i can't see the word decentralisation being used with just 400 nodes. 

Something need to change, otherwise we will find ourselves with a very complicated machine that doesnt solve the AWS centralisation problem.

Governance, has to be sorted, so the community can grow and prosper; Foundation shall take a step back on certain votes and a much more constructive dialogue shall be started.

I'm (and have long been) a strong supporter of Dfinity and the IC, but certain things need to change and i am sure with the will of all the partecipants this will happen.

guillaumestols | 2021-12-09 21:02:58 UTC | #260

I guys, sorry I'm tired to follow this thread, and tbh I'm against any form of copyright, IP, or censorship. My deep thought is that if you want to be sure, buy labelled stuff, you'll pay for it, and the labels will do the job, or not. Otherwise, go wild, and there is a badland proposal that sounds more appealing to me in this sense. I think I'll be be more constructive there.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-09 21:15:48 UTC | #261

We should fork Kleros (crypto-economic court system) and put it in charge of canister removal. NNS ratifies content policy per subnet. Node providers decide what subnets to host based on content policy. Badlands subnet has no policy but low hardware requirements so homes can run nodes. Thus, we can still have high performance data center nodes that avoid jail time and full censorship resistance household nodes in badlands. Everyone wins.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2021-12-09 21:31:34 UTC | #262

Allow subnets to serve a specialised purpose that might be competence/geographical based or any other combination. Each subnet with own governing policy, but tech consistent. This way governing is decentralised for the many different situations that will eventually make centralised decision making impossible for a global protocol serving across jurisdictions. 

No removal or state change can be done by the general NNS for each subnet. 

BadLands can be one of the subnets without KYC where everything goes.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-09 21:52:57 UTC | #263

Would the notion of node provider be morphed into something different when we have nodesdao (i.e.dfinitynodes)? Who owns the node in that case? Would we then push it up the chain to the data center because nobody can find the actual person who owns that node?

-------------------------

Gabriel | 2021-12-10 00:06:00 UTC | #264

Someone will still have to sign for those servers to be hosted in a DC. I think I asked the guy building dfinitynodes about this, and his response was that even tho there's multiple people owning the servers a  contract between a DC and an entity has to exist. So at least one person is liable. I might be wrong but ask Cole.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-10 00:35:55 UTC | #265

Thanks! Could that entity be an LLC in, say, Wyoming/Texas; with entire governance of that entity on a DAO? I think it might require some mental gymnastics with the data center folks.

For this kind of Scihub, it will be up to the community to decide. If it brings a lot of benefit for many people, I believe most will vote "no" to censorship, but it is still piracy. Better solution should be proposed.
ICP actually also open up new door for hosting new model for sci-hub. What if there is new sci-hub that researchers can publish their own work directly without middleman (aka publisher), and get reward/donation directly from the reader ? It is disruptive for editor/publishing industry, but this way still within the legal coridor.

See the quoted thread. Is this what we want for The IC? How does the NNS decide what a legitimate DCMA request is vs one that is a merely a vehicle for oppression? Will there be a team of lawyers? Will they be able to deal with 10s, 100s or even 1000s of requests a day?

If it is the boundary nodes getting the notices, but are not really hosting the content but are just rerouting, (please correct me if I understand this wrong) maybe would have to get a court case going where liability is found not to be with the boundary node, since they have no power over what is getting routed over their server? Community fund comes to mind. Let them enter the rabbit hole, and make it difficult to spam the node operators with notices?
I get the point that this case could set a bad example, and spamming a node operator with letters could be a kind of attack vector to mess with the system.

You keep claiming that you don't say anything derogatory about the technology behind the IC. And you're technically correct.

But if you want to be taken seriously rather than fought tooth and nail or more often just ignored, then comments like the two above and fringe positions like "there will be plenty of child porn but on canisters that aren't all that popular" are definitely not helping your argument.

I could get behind a couple of your arguments a few screens up (e.g. that any amount of moderation is moderation and that would make it hard to push back against questionable legal requests. But as someone who's often sarcastic and passive aggressive online (I'm trying really hard to be on my best behavior here, as a DFINITY employee) I can tell you from experience that (i) sticking to the argument without blowing it out of proportion and (ii) trying your best to understand counter-arguments and address them will take you much farther.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 09:40:59 UTC | #274

If we could manage to take liability from the boundary nodes, would be a first step, then kick liability down the road, nodes can't choose what subnet they're on (did I understand that correct?), and it could be argued they have no power over the content on any particular subnet. I'm just thinking loud here, about how to buy time for technical solutions to be available. I agree it should be extremely difficult to take anything down, a simple letter sounds way too easy.

-------------------------

free | 2021-12-10 09:46:08 UTC | #275

E.g. AFAICT you still haven't addressed what are in my view not one but two elephants in the room:

1. Shuffling stuff around (e.g. allowing node operators to blacklist canisters) may help initially, but if because of this the IC becomes first and foremost a platform for content that's illegal in most jurisdictions instead of first and foremost a decentralized platform for content and apps that are useful to the general public, then IMHO it's quite possible that it will be reduced by legal means to a handful of nodes in Bermuda and Salvador rather than what everyone here envisions it to be.

2. Having the NNS at all and allowing it to make changes to evolve the protocol (as opposed to e.g. ICP price and SDR exchange rate changes only) means that protocol changes can be made that would introduce moderation. So either the network is immutable (and I can honestly tell you that we're not at a point where the implementation, and to some extent the protocol, can support thousands of subnets; and is lacking many, many features required to make it fully autonomous); or if it's mutable, then all this discussion of no moderation is purely philosophical. Again, IMHO.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-10 09:47:33 UTC | #276

The comments above are legitimate! This is the choice The IC faces! And yes it's sardonic but I'm replying to a guy that has repeatedly put words in my mouth and insinuated I'm some form of anarchist. 

Your request is like asking me to be more nuanced about the existence of gravity in order to win people over and come to some compromise. There is no compromise! Gravity just exists. The same applies here. If you put in place power structures to govern a network you will not, under any cirumstance, be treated like a decentralised autonomous network. You'll be treated like AWS, Goldman Sachs, Paypal, The NYSE, Facebook or whatever. This is a fact of life that shockingly seems completely lost on the team.

It is also a fact of life that yes there would be CP on a censorship resistant IC. It's a fact of life it's all over the internet now! You seem to be aspiring to some utopia that does not and will never exist. Imagine we were having this conversation 30 years ago and I said "yes if we allow people use this encryption a tiny minority will use it to send CP" and you responded "if you're trying to people over to mass encryption use with statements like that it's not going to work!!" 

My mind continues to be blown gentlemen. What do you think you're working on here? What is The IC to you? How can it simulataneously be both a governed and Web 3.0 platform? Enlighten me.

-------------------------

Show me one jurisdiction (that has had to address this issue at all) that has decided to take the approach you are suggesting for the IC: "there will always be CP on the internet, so why don't we just leave this mildly popular CP site up?"

Yes, you need to be more nuanced in your arguments if you want to be taken seriously by the majority of those you are trying to convince. Else you come across as one of the way too many fringe political groups that one could point to. Who are either laughed off or feared (and fought against) by the majority.

???? Every jurisdiction has embraced the internet, the tech that allowed everyone, including paedos communicate with each other much more easily. Every jurisdiction has embraced encryption. Most jurisdictions have now embraced Bitcoin and Ethereum despite them allowing permissionless payments for all sorts of things (such as CP) states don't like. 

These debates simply don't happen in the Ethereum community. It was always understood unsavouries would use it. It's also understood it's still, on the whole, overwhelmingly a force for good in the world. There is clearly an unwillingness to accept that bad things that will happen on The IC here, and a complete lack of understanding of the consequences of that unwillingness. 

You can label me fringe all you want but I represent the viewpoint held by the 99% in the Web 3.0 community - a community Dfinity claims to be a part of. 

I'm not unwilling to address those problems at all. I literally cannot address them as long as governance/moderation/censorhip of the ledger is a goal. If that's the goal, my recommendations won't be for node shuffling, etc, that would be needless overhead, I'd recommend incorporating, hiring teams to deal with DCMA requests, registering ICP as a security and competing with AWS by the rules it must play by - because you will eventuallly be forced to - rather than competing with Ethereum by the rules it plays by.

To prove my sarcastic credentials then: in this case you've got nothing to worry about. I'm confident the 99% of you will be easily able to push through a motion proposal to turn off the NNS altogether, no technical solution needed.

If this position were to be taken, node operators would likely have to be idemnified against loss in the event of failure in order to sign on.  They also would have to weigh the business impact on their reputation (it could be positive or negative).  It also means every time an node is installed in a new jurisdiction, a case could potentially go before the court in that jurisdiction.  Not all jurisdictions have judicial integrity or independence.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 13:40:13 UTC | #288

Did I understood boundary nodes to work as something like gate(keepers) between the internet computer (ICP) and the rest of the internet(IP), correct?
So anything coming from the IC goes through? Mario was showing up as something like this?  $ host boundary.dfinity.network ?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-10 13:52:57 UTC | #289

I understand that the boundary node provides confidentiality services and implements an information flow policy to protect and enable communication with canisters.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 14:27:09 UTC | #290

So from the outside it might look like the content comes from the boundary node while it actually doesn't and just assists with communication between canisters and the e.g. browsers?

Précis

The Internet Computer Protocol Community was faced with its first contentious governance issue since the May 2021 Genesis.  In response to a well recognized copyrighted game being deployed on the IC,  a notice of copyright infringement was filed with a node provider by the copyright owner.  A proposal to remove the offending canister was put forward on the NNS by the Dfinity Foundation.  The game was taken down voluntarily by the canister owner, and subsequently the vote for removal was voted down.
Discussion on the Dfinity Forum has been passionate and polarized.  It can be construed as follows:
•	Hands off
•	Intervene
Factors being discussed:
•	The NNS should not be involved in content moderation – it should be treated like a telecom carrier.
•	Moderating content for any reason enables censorship and invites governments to interfere.
•	The NNS having the capability to remove content unintentionally provides the mechanism to implement censorship. 
•	Government regulations differ globally and trying to moderate in this context is impossible.
•	The ability to identify nodes exposes data centres and node operators to litigation.
•	Removing canisters is anathema to the wider crypto community and impacts social scalability.
•	The IC must survive in a real-world with legal constructs.
•	Some in the community support the protection of IP, and removal of inappropriate content.
•	Node operators will likely unplug if faced with legal action.
•	IP Infringement notices can be weaponized.
•	Node operators should be protected from litigation.
•	A legal defence of boundary operations should be considered.
•	The ICP is not yet censor-proof
•	Other blockchains have not had to deal with storage issues (e.g. Bitcoin and Eth).
•	The appropriateness of Dfinity putting the matter to a vote.
•	The lack of defined process accepted by the community.

Too much armchair philosophy, not enough solutions. Let's talk about solutions.

@Ciaran proposes absolutely no moderation. This would require an NNS vote, and legally jeopardize most current node operators. I doubt this will pass, but @Ciaran how about you submit a proposal?

I have proposed to fork/integrate Kleros, a crypto-economic court system, to handle disputes regarding content, on a per-subnet basis. The NNS will ratify content policies per subnet, except for Badlands, which will have no moderation ability. Kleros 2.0 launching in 2022 will support arbitration on external chains, and I'm sure IC's Chain Key/Eth integration could help facilitate using the canonical Kleros, if we don't want to burden Dfinity engineers with forking it (and translating Solidity to Motoko/Rust). This will allow us to have high performance data center nodes in most countries AND a full (but slower) censorship-resistant subnet. It will take time to integrate Kleros but we could start using it immediately as a signalling mechanism, in which successful disputes signal NNS voters to remove a canister.

Another idea proposed by @superduper is to create a market for running canisters, where node operators bid on canisters awaiting deployment. Legally risky canisters will receive less bids and thus pay a higher price for resources, and it empowers node operators to determine their own legal risk. This would require a major redesign to the protocol. For instance, subnets would probably have to be changed to be created on-the-fly for each canister/app, where the nodes that bid on it get placed into this subnet which then only runs that canister (or group of canisters all part of the same app).

A fourth idea mentioned elsewhere is to hire professional teams that run neurons for the sole purpose of content moderation. Neuron users then delegate just the remove canister action to these neurons, assuming they trust their judgement. Per-subnet content policies are then interpreted by these professional teams.

What other solution ideas do we have to move forward with?

I propose it for technology that's ready. It's become clear to me that The IC was launched before it was capable of functioning as a Web 3.0 platform, because, unlike in other blockchain networks, it leaves node operators liable. 

So apart from me agreeing with you that it won't pass, I don't see the point in proposing it because even if it does pass, it won't matter. Node operators would be on the hook and that's simply not viable. 

I'm going to start a new thread - as this one descended into mud slinging - and outline why I think a totally censorship-resistant base layer wouldn't be the disaster some think it would be. It would simply mean you kick governance up to other layers where more focused, local and resourced teams can use various tools to pursue their political goals. Eg, there are still ways to disappear things from the internet without deleting them from servers. 

We already see the negative externalities of irreversible TXs being mediated on other blockchains through various innovations and I don't see why this would be different with The IC.

The key point is that if you don't have a secure base layer that can't be routinely tampered with, you don't have the foundation Web 3.0 needs to exist (forget just surviving, to actually exist). You need to deliver that first, then you deal with the challenges it creates for other public policy goals.

Cool @Ciaran look forward to your thread. I would be interested to read a practical design for a network that meets your goals.

Ill propose one more idea:

Have one app per subnet, app deployer specifies how many nodes they want, and the acceptable geographical locations of the nodes. Then the IC automatically finds nodes with capacity for this app, creates the subnet, and joins the nodes to it. The cycles cost scales with # of nodes. Then, if node provider gets DMCA or similar legal threat, they simply remove themselves from that subnet. This pushes the problem to node providers but is a more legally defensible position (see DMCA safe harbor rules), and absolves the NNS from dealing with moderation decisions. This is closer to the market-based solution so it could be an interim design to get to a market-priced cycles cost in the future, which allows the free market to price in legal risk. Also, subnets could have a "class" that represents the types of nodes it needs (high storage, GPU, etc).

So... used only once is fine for Eth, but not for the InternetComputer?

Hi @NickM , I was just remembering the case... I remember reading about it, the DAO hack and the role back... I am not saying it is fine to role back. Personally, for me it felt like a "move" (a decision from the ETH community) that I was not expecting, because as we know, one of the great things about the blockchain is that we can't just simply role back ... it has to be a hard fork, with the majority of nodes/miners accepting it.

@Ciaran it seems the problem is about there being a single liable entity under the current state of the IC, would you be okay not absolutely removing [content] governance but remaking the system such that decisions are distributed enough across participants that no single entity becomes liable? e.g. requiring extraordinary neuron participation, disallow voting by following, making dfinity unable to vote on governance, only on technical issues, etc.. and making nodes unaware of what they're hosting somehow. That way you can still have content moderation at the protocol level, but it would become extremely unlikely to happen, and if it happened it would NOT be for external legal reasons.
This seems to be a middle point between the positions displayed in this thread that solves the problem of external entities having a reach into the protocol.

Still interested in hearing more about how you use quadratic voting to implement systems of intellectual property if you're willing to share (perhaps in a different post). 

Doesn't quadratic voting suffer quite a bit from the Sybil problem?

Here's a useful thought metric to gauge how "Open" the "Open Internet" is really going to be:

How many websites that are indexed by search engines on the "closed" web would be banned from existing as Canisters under any given rule change to the Internet Computer's policies?

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-11 21:09:40 UTC | #301

Here's what I want to know...what happens when Craig Wright issues a copyright infringement claim for a Canister serving Bitcoin smart contracts? O_O =)

I'm still just really really really struggling to add the following up: 

"We're building an unstoppable network to withstand electromagnetic pulse attacks and nuclear war" 

Vs.

"Wow, Nintendo's pretty mad, here...we better seriously re-consider what the Internet Computer is going to be about."

Coming from the same Foundation. 

Especially when the Internet Computer is being presented as this "big threat" to a lot of players -- given this discussion, I get the feeling it's posing a far larger threat to the people that trusted the initial claims around it than it is to anybody else. 

@free Here's an example that may be more tangible instantiation for you:

In 1933, the President of the United States signed Executive Order 6102, declaring it illegal for private citizens to hold gold (USG proceeded to amass a supply from citizens at a mandated exchange price of $20.67 and then subsequently raised the price to $35 through another law when they had gathered a suitable amount.)

Many people were prosecuted for the audacity to hold that day's equivalent of Bitcoin as a hedge against government. Nationwide mandate, in a large country.

So, if something like that happens again, the Foundation is for banning any Canister that facilitates the purchase of XAU by private individuals, yeah? 

Only in the countries where it's declared illegal, or all over or what?

This is why I think @Manu's approach holds a lot of promise, because it essentially opens up the ability for Canisters to be "global citizens" in a sense, operating in jurisdictions where they are legal to serve content and functions that may be in demand from ethical citizens of other countries where what the Canisters are doing is or would be outlawed for no legitimate reason at all.

By the way, I wrote a ~600 word response to your other thing, but it was apparently too long to post on the forum.

MisterSignal | 2021-12-11 21:21:50 UTC | #302

Yeah, I really question whether or not DFINITY understands how large the magnitude of the backlash to voting for some kind of top-down censorship initiative is going to be, in many ways.

MisterSignal | 2021-12-12 00:02:34 UTC | #303

-- I think one of the key takeaways of this discussion so far is that the most resilient solutions (like the market-based approach you're proposing) give node operators the ability to calibrate their own risk profile. 

In the examples of Snowden/Assange/etc... that I gave above, I'd like to think at least one node operator *somewhere* in the world would decide they felt strong enough to host that content, thereby providing pushback against global censorship while allowing those who didn't feel comfortable with the legal risk to opt out.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-12 00:03:44 UTC | #304

I think the reality of the situation hit them hard, if all nodes are hosted in data centers and can be kicked from it if they dont follow DMCA guidelines the whole network will slowly deteriorate. I'm impressed this scenario took so long to happen and I'm impressed nobody talked about it before it did, but yeah no matter which side you're on, if node providers are liable for content hosted on their servers we dont have much choice.
