Hello community,

The Internet Computer is the most powerful general-purpose blockchain for building infinitely scalable Web3 dapps, that is, the only blockchain with the speed and capability of hosting content 100% on-chain. As a result, the Internet Computer blockchain is the first blockchain that needs to tackle issues related to the DMCA process for smart contracts. For other blockchains that rely on centralized cloud services to host content, content is removed by vendors, such as AWS, in compliance with takedown notices. Web3 will look to all of us to lead on this issue — and the first challenge has arrived.

DFINITY Foundation was contacted on December 6, 2021 by a node provider who received a notice of infringement of copyrighted materials from Nintendo Co., Ltd. asking to remove the Super Mario 64 emulator that was deployed to canister smart contract culg2-qyaaa-aaaai-qa7sa-cai by controller u4u53-bhmqg-vc4mk-abm2u-mo6kz-jptpk-icn6i-gpkve-5b57m-m4cn5-jqe on November 27, 2021 (details on ic.rocks [here](https://ic.rocks/principal/culg2-qyaaa-aaaai-qa7sa-cai)). This poses a new question for the Internet Computer community regarding copyrighted content in canisters hosted on the Internet Computer blockchain and is an opportunity to learn how situations like this can be handled by neuron holders of the Internet Computer via the NNS.

To deal with situations like this, the NNS has a proposal type "remove canister". When a proposal of this type is adopted by the NNS, the canister specified in the proposal is removed from the Internet Computer. In the future, additional methods will be supported to suspend the canister to provide more opportunity for due process and debate.

Possible reasons for submitting such a proposal to remove a canister from the Internet Computer blockchain include the following:

* While the Internet Computer is designed to be censorship resistant, in order for it to be adopted as the “world computer” by the mainstream, it is critical to abide by laws against terrorism, child pornography, etc., as well as regulations around copyright infringement and intellectual property laws.
* The Internet Computer network is comprised of independent node providers, who can choose to comply with any legal notices sent to them and remove their respective node(s) from the network. While the Internet Computer has close to 400 independently operated node machines (+ approximately 600 idle node machines) and is constantly expanding, the removal of any healthy nodes should be avoided to ensure network stability and continued growth.

Going forward, we encourage the community to develop an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for the Internet Computer blockchain. Once a draft of this policy is complete, we would then put it forth as a “motion” proposal to be voted on by the neuron holders. Once approved, community members could review content on the network and enforce the policy by putting forward NNS proposals. Updates and changes to the policy could also be made via NNS proposals.

Many developers are choosing to have Terms and Conditions for their products on the dapp level. For one-off canisters, such as culg2-qyaaa-aaaai-qa7sa-cai, and for even more complex cases, we will need community-driven, network-wide standards and processes.

As a complement to the above approach, we are encouraging the community to also discuss the following:

* The possibility of an independent review board, made up of leading organizations outside of the Internet Computer ecosystem with expertise in topics such as content moderation and internet freedom. We envision that these organizations could be provisioned with their own neurons to vote on issues and proposals related to the AUP. We are open to your feedback and ideas of organizations you would like to see involved.
* Implementing the full DMCA process, including counter notifications, in the form of NNS proposals.

We invite your feedback here in the thread both on this specific situation as well as the ideas we have put forth on longer-term solutions.

Please be on the lookout for a "remove canister" proposal within the next hours. The DFINITY Foundation plans to abstain from voting.

As mentioned, in many ways ideally node operators would not have to worry about the content they host. Especially as we seek to improve security through node shuffling, secure enclaves, and other means of "obfuscation", it seems very beneficial for security and legal simplicity on the part of node operators, to allow them some form of plausible deniability, so that they can join and leave as they please and as the network requires.

Basically I'm saying node operators shouldn't even know what they're running (seems ideal in many ways). Not sure if that's the best way to go, but has many advantages.

If that's the case, seems like the NNS may have to step up as the great moderator of the network. Many people will take great issue with this, so it is up to us to do this better than the centralized companies have, or we've just recreated the same situation more or less.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-07 16:10:55 UTC | #3

I think personal responsibility is very important here. I don't want anyone to be liable for others' choices as far as possible, and I don't want to be restricted in my choices as far as possible. For example, instead of an acceptable use policy that we all must agree to, I would rather see a takedown policy.

Canister developers should be free to make their own choices and deploy what they will, free from the burden of agreeing to any kind of acceptable use policy. But, if what they deploy violates the takedown policy, the community MAY decide to take down the canisters.

This is much like free speech in the US. Free speech can never be suppressed. But once spoken, action can be taken against harmful or illegal speech.

We must as a community decide what that harmful or illegal speech is.

I'm not sure I explained myself well, it's a bit nuanced. Basically as a canister developer I don't want to agree to some terms of use, I want to be a free agent. But if what I deploy goes against the takedown policy, I should expect no recourse from the NNS taking my canisters down.

One of the main reasons I fell in love with the idea of the Internet Computer was to get away from the arbitrary rules given to me by my previous monopolistic overlords.

Let's balance free agency with responsibility. Let people be free, stop them only if absolutely necessary.

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-07 16:52:20 UTC | #4

I'm curious if the node provider actually knew they were running the canister, or if they just received the notice and forwarded it on.

Regarding the burden on node providers; this may be an ignorant statement, but I think the legal battle is going to have to be had at some point (in each country i guess) to determine how liable node providers are for the applications they host. I agree that node shuffling, secure enclaves and other obfuscation will help their case, but this is still going to be a legal battle that has to be had.

Perhaps we could have a community funded DAO that helps cover legal costs for node providers?

Edit: wanted to add that I agree with @lastmjs regarding the AUP. I don’t believe the IC should have an AUP. Anyone should be free to deploy whatever they want. But i do agree with having a takedown policy that says “you’re free to deploy whatever you want; but the community is free to remove it at any time”. The only thing we might need is a way to penalize the principal ID in the event that it is a severe offense.

ysyms | 2021-12-07 19:30:06 UTC | #6

Of course we should formulate decentralized laws, which should be written in canister and controlled by NNS

Fwiw. This topic is one of the most exciting things about governance of a true Web3 "world computer", which did not exist until the launch of the Internet Computer. So much easier for Web2.5 chains and services... aka, defer to Uncle Jeff at AWS or remove it yourself :rofl:

In all seriousness, appreciate the discussion and all the feedback... keep it going!

jorgenbuilder | 2021-12-08 00:40:52 UTC | #9

Echoing others, it would be great if in an ideal world node providers could be sheltered from this kind of heat, considering the apparent negative effect of node removal on the network. It informs my leaning if the repercussions are a node has to go offline and the network is destabilized (although maybe only a bit?) 

I can imagine a scenario where succeeding in sheltering node providers from one-off cases ultimately escalates to more organized opposition to node providers. I.e. if enough people get mad at what's running on the network do nodes just become illegal to operate in some places. I suppose any blockchain has that problem.

The Mario 64 canister feels like a tech demo in good humour that doesn't have a significant negative effect on anyone, and I'm personally tempted to vote to hold the line just to see how things shake out. Should we treat this as a learning opportunity on defending against copyright claims, squeeze some tuition out of it and see how resilient we are / what to improve?

I can't help but think that we'd be laughed out of the room if our blockchain caved in to the first copyright claim that came our way.

cyberowl | 2021-12-08 00:41:54 UTC | #10

I think the foundation should abstain from voting on issues like this. As a dev it would discourage me from building if at any point IC can just take down my ap. How is it different than uncle Jeff. This is Nintendo, not a powerful government. Imagine if a government came with a take down notice, then what? I agree with the community voting to take it down but right now I don't think the platform is decentralized enough for that to happen. Most just follow the foundation.

-------------------------

jorgenbuilder | 2021-12-08 01:07:19 UTC | #11

OP says Dfinity plans to abstain. Worth mentioning that afaik a proposal that the foundation's neurons abstain from has had a hard time gaining any traction in the past.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2021-12-08 00:54:45 UTC | #12

This case is important to define ICP as the censorship resistant Web3 infrastructure. Resistant to censorship does not mean that any 'malicious' activities can flourish in ICP. This is why NNS DAO is invented, either to takedown or not.
For the case of Nintendo, the solution is actually simple, rather give the node provider a notice of infringement of copyrighted materials, Nintendo should propose takedown proposal, and they can do it by their-self vote "yes". This also show the use case & the power of ICP NNS DAO that can not be done to other blockchain.

-------------------------

bobbylingus | 2021-12-08 01:00:08 UTC | #13

If the proposal passes without Dfinity voting, I would be ok with that. 

It would be a huge step in blockchain history

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2021-12-08 01:04:06 UTC | #14

True. I myself decide to abstain for this vote. I prefer to see Nintendo vote for their own 'voice'.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-08 01:15:55 UTC | #15

You bring up a good point. What if the entity like Nintendo or Disney just buy ICP to create a neuron and vote for their proposals. Could they then buy enough ICP to take down any content that infringes on their IP. Would there be a case where it is not straight forward and the foundation will need to vote against them?

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-12-08 01:40:56 UTC | #16

I personally am voting no on this (at least at this time). If we are going to delete canisters, we first need to come up with a formal set of rules that (1) outline what cannot be on the Internet Computer, and (2) describe what the appropriate process is to get content removed. To do that, we need to have an extremely robust discussion where we outline the pros and cons of allowing token holders to determine what can and cannot be deleted. If we move too quickly--which I think we are--we may experience some negative consequences that we didn't anticipate. 

Separately, the ability for nodes to be pressured like this is a serious attack vector. Governments could potentially attack applications they don't like by threating node operators within their jurisdiction. If that happens, we will either have to start watching nodes leave right and left, or we will have to bow to the wishes of the government(s) and remove the canisters. To the extent possible, it might make sense to obfuscate the identities of node providers to remove this attack vector (or at least diminish it).

-------------------------

jorgenbuilder | 2021-12-08 01:41:31 UTC | #17

I voted no half an hour ago because I didn’t know when the vote was going to close. Current distribution is 5.2 million adopt against 6,200 to reject. Not sure who the 5.2M is, I haven’t seen them talking about their stance anywhere.

-------------------------

Rsl_033 | 2021-12-08 01:49:18 UTC | #18

I generally agree with this. There's little point in building a censorship resistant network if there's nothing on it that isn't worth censoring. Large multinationals, like, maybe, Google, or, a Chinese Communist Party property company, buying big neurons and colluding to vote themselves immunity from criticism is a valid concern.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-08 01:56:02 UTC | #19

I'm not terribly concerned about the use of the terns Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) or Takedown Policy (TP).  I understand and agree with the concepts, but to me the application of these terms still requires community definition and the implementation has the same result no matter what we call it.

I also think it is appropriate for Dfinity to abstain from voting.  That ensures this decision is made in a decentralized governance way.  This is also a good reason why the pending motion proposal referenced here ([Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights (Proposal)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172)) is so important.  The ICA of the DFINITY Foundation should not be the arbiters of governance proposals like this one.

I will vote no on this proposal because we need more governance tooling to address this type of issue and this particular cannister isn't really causing any harm.  I'm actually curious if the cannister owner would take it down voluntarily now that this issue is know in the community.  I would like to see this proposal come up again in the future after there is more time for deliberation and there are more capabilities built into the NNS to more appropriately address this type of issue.

@alexa.smith thanks for starting this discussion.  You did a great job of explaining the issue, what is needed from the community, and what DF plans to make available to assist with these decisions in the future.

I don't think the goal of a censorship-resistant platform should be to defend against legitimate and legal claims of copyright infringement. Nintendo owns the intellectual property to the game and has not authorized this use. They are fully within their rights as far as I know, in the US.

Open source in the US is built on top of a robust legal framework that assures intellectual property rights. This must be respected, or our way of life and cooperation begins to break down.

Would we be okay with others taking our open source code and ripping out or otherwise ignoring the licenses? If not this is a double standard which is not morally or logically consistent.

Web3 shouldn't be about anarchy and pushing whatever we want onto the internet without consequences. The rule of law is important, especially since not all law can be codified as digital code and executed by machines.

Censorship-resistance I would say is much more about protection against arbitrary interference with legitimate activities. Of course we as a community need to decide what arbitrary and legitimate mean.

Protecting the legal and legitimate copyrights of an entity is not the kind of censorship we should be concerned with.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-08 02:24:23 UTC | #21

The point, in all it's seriousness, has to do with whose law?  Certain countries outlaw blasphemy. And in some of those countries,  blasphemous speech is strictly punished. 

The question is can we even draw a line in a global context?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 02:31:36 UTC | #22

Yes of course, important point. As a United States citizen who sees no issue with Nintendo's claim (though I wish they would allow this usage, it's not up to me to force their hand nor infringe) I will personally vote to shut the canister down.

As we move to come to a consensus as a community on what we will and will not allow, I'm sure we'll all weigh in on what we believe is right. What is legal may have a lot to do with that.

But of course in our direct liquid democracy, it's currently mob rule.

It should be, because it goes to the core of the problems that Twitter and Facebook faced last year. Are they publishers, or platforms? Does their content moderation make them responsible for what they host? If you take responsibility for removal of material for violating ToS *pre-emptive* of court demands, you are then responsible for things that a jurisdiction believes you should have controlled. You lose the right to the defence of common carrier. Given that you will have hybrid applications that will use, for example, IPFS for data storage but deliver that via canister, that is going to be a large moderation burden.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 02:35:46 UTC | #24

Also, I think we should start considering how difficult it should be to pass some of these proposals. I don't think the simple direct liquid democracy is appropriate for every proposal.

How hard should it be for us to shut down this canister? I'm kind of thinking it should take an extraordinary amount of voting power to do this, like 2/3 or more.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 02:41:59 UTC | #25

Hmm...hypothetically speaking, what would the court do in this case? Who would they order to do what?

northman | 2021-12-08 02:43:31 UTC | #26

Most of the nodes are in countries that are members of World Intellectual Property Organization. If we do not act as responsible citizens, it will accelerate/stimulate the imposition of regulatory countermeasures that are unhelpful.  Placing this burden on node operators is unfair. While playing Mario may be fun, it is not something for which I would sacrifice the reputation of the IC.

Regarding a takedown policy, it should include:
•	terrorist content;
•	content that incites violence;
•	hate speech;
•	non-consensual sharing of intimate images; and
•	child sexual exploitation content;
•	cyber security issue;
•	copyright infringement
•	money laundering
•	other criminal activity

The difficulty with “other criminal activity” is the differences in law from one nation to another. For example, being critical of one’s government varies based on jurisdiction and can range from being considered treason  to just being an engaged citizen. Even more complex is content censorship.

Depending on the nature of the complaint and the jurisdiction, the representations to take down could be mild or severe, legal or illegal including intimidation, coercion, state sanction execution and even military action.  

Implementing the SNS will help take the load off of the NNS.  I suggest that once the SNS gets rolling, the NNS or node operator should be able to send a message to the Dapp’s SNS informing that there is an issue (if the NNS has been advised) of the following types:

•	Operational issue
•	Security Issue
•	Compliance Issue

The SNS can vote and reply or ignore.

If it is sufficiently grave issue or in the absence of a SNS based DAO, the NNS may take unilateral action based on community votes (e.g. to suspend the canister) which has always been the case. However, with an SNS in place, the NNS would inform the SNS that the Dapp has been suspended.
It is fairly easy to vote and take down a single canister.  Self-regeneration mechanisms will surely be deployed and will make this more difficult as time goes on.  Think of the game Whack-a-Mole.  Also, if rotating workloads between nodes is implemented, the node operators may not have to be involved in the issue.  

I wrote before on this subject in August:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/service-nervous-system-governance-for-dapps/6151/5?u=northman

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 02:45:22 UTC | #27

I suppose another option, which I believe someone else has mentioned, is to just wait and see if the canister creator will remove the canister.

I didn't consider the potential legal consequences of our actions now. If we act in certain ways we might transform ourselves into forever arbiters under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

After all, this is the fault of the creator of the canister, it would be great if that person could take responsibility.

Taking this to the extreme, what happens when that person doesn't respond and this goes to court?

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-12-08 02:48:13 UTC | #28

I generally agree. But this raises serious issues. First, who determines what is considered a "legitimate" claim of intellectual property infringement? Even though this case seems to be open and shut, IP disputes are often messy. Moreover, a malicious actor could completely lie and say that something on the Internet Computer violates their intellectual property. Are we going to rely on voters to do independent research to determine whether something actually is a violation of intellectual property? Are we going to require both sides to submit their arguments on why something is or is not a violation? 

Second, how does this scale? As the Internet Computer gets larger and larger, how is it going to be humanly possible for voters to determine what is a valid claim of infringement and what isn't? Indeed, we might get hundreds of takedown requests a day. Nobody can go through all of them. 

Third, can this be gamed? If people aren't paying attention to these votes because they don't have the requisite information to determine what actually constitutes infringement, they will either (1) abstain, or (2) vote at random. In theory, they can just rely on the neurons they follow to vote for them. But it's not clear to me that ICDevs, Cycle DAO, etc. will have the ability to accurately make judgment calls on the infringement either--let alone the time. If a large enough number of people abstain from voting, voting could be captured by a handful of malicious actors. For example, Google or Facebook could stake ICP tokens and vote to remove all canisters that try to compete with them--on the theory that the competitors are violating their IP. 

These are serious issues.

Actually I'm reconsidering this based on the comments. Though I think this specific request by Nintendo is legitimate, I'm not sure who should ultimately be responsible for the takedown and when. A simple reactive response to a DMCA request may not be appropriate.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2021-12-08 02:54:18 UTC | #30

Interesting fact, to reach the 3% simple majority threshold with a single vote, an 8-year neuron would currently need staked ICP equivalent to about $150M USD.

northman | 2021-12-08 03:03:38 UTC | #33

If we take the position that a court order would be sufficent to act, not all courts in all nations make judgements based on the same principles, values and laws.  "Being considered a carrier" - is US centric.  Do we know where this node operator is situated?  In some jurisdictions, failure to act can result in penalties.  Also, what jurisdiction's law applies to the IC?  There is no caselaw yet is there?

Just an idea, is it possible for ICP to provide somekind of protocol for IP copyright protection in form of NFT on ICP? let say...for example the Mario64 software file 256-hash as the NFT. So, if any malicious canister want to upload the same file software, will be autorejected.

So all code in a canister has a hash.  It is very easy to change the content by altering 1 bit in a canister.

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-12-08 03:19:01 UTC | #37

I couldn’t figure out from the discussion what would happen to the node provider if we didn’t shut the canister down? Does it mean they will be held responsible for the canister and probably the could be under a legal responsibility?
Before I vote we also want to know what’s the consequences of our votes in regard to our node providers.

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-12-08 03:28:05 UTC | #38

Coin_master, we don't know what will happen. My bet is she would probably be sued and have to defend herself in court, which would be quite expensive in the US. The node operator might think that it's not worth paying attorneys to defend herself, and just shut down her node to avoid suit.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-08 03:30:14 UTC | #39

And that would be node prerogatives to close down the node. If there is enough economic incentive,, they should be trying to convince the community to shut the canister down instead of the whole node. 

And none of this would matter if enough decentralization is in place(i.e. a subnet having nodes across the globe)

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-08 03:43:03 UTC | #40

And extending the thought a little bit, the genesis of this discussion was:"  DFINITY Foundation was contacted on December 6, 2021 by a node provider who received a notice of infringement of copyrighted materials from Nintendo Co., Ltd. asking to remove the Super Mario 64 emulator that was deployed to canister smart contract "

Why should the dfinity foundation care in the sense of the fact that (a) it does not own the node providers (b) it doesn't own the content (c) the canister can be voted down by participants of the NNS  if agreed to?

If DFINITY Foundation didn't bring it up here,  the community would have never known. Who is the complaint against? How can it be the node provider? How would taking down a node cure the offense;if any?

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-08 03:44:51 UTC | #41

Maybe Nintendo should upload it's own canister.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-08 03:46:19 UTC | #42

Quick point of clarification.  This proposal won’t be decided by liquid democracy.  DF (for sure) and ICA (I’m not sure) are not going to vote as per Alexa’s original proposal message.  I don’t think cycle_dao, ICDevs, or anyone else has enough followers to execute what we commonly refer to as liquid democracy.  Most neurons will not vote automatically on this proposal.  It will need to be manual voting of at least 9.3M votes that are a majority of total votes cast in order to pass.  This seems like it will play out as a decentralized governance decision to me.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-08 03:47:58 UTC | #43

To be honest this will get wild before it gets any better. It is the beginning of people uploading movies, music and all kinds of things. Dfinity prob knows the identity of the person because they had to fund the canister. They prob went through KYC I imagine since no other exchanges exist. However there will be anon exchanges and then what. There will be anon actors uploading all kinds of illegal things.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-08 03:49:08 UTC | #44

As much as I’d like to believe we have enough geographical distribution to really take a strong stance against censorship, I don’t think that’s the case.

I will be voting to adopt this proposal but I definitely understand why others will choose to reject it.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-12-08 04:49:01 UTC | #45

I don't fully understand the details of this case...

* Who is this node provider and which jurisdiction are they in? I don't know why Nintendo picked this node provider to contact. They probably don't know that a single node can't actually take down a canister.
* If we vote to remove this canister, can't the developer just upload another identical canister...?

-----

So if this proposal fails, what happens next? Nintendo will sue... whom? I guess they could contact the principal controller... if they can figure out how to contact them. They could choose to sue DFINITY, which could work if DFINITY collectively owns >50% of the vote, which they do with liquid democracy and don't without (I think). But if that does happen, people could choose to vote independently so enforcement isn't guaranteed.

In any case, I think any publicity with a lawsuit like this could actually be great for the IC from a marketing POV. It'll at least counter the "ICP not decentralized" narrative. Would be fun to see where that goes.

Voting no.

We should politely request that Nintendo submit the proposal themselves because **we have time and we don't *actually* have proof Nintendo sent any notice at all.** 

As far as Bob B's research yielded, DMCA notices have a 7-day response period. It's been 1 day so far. Let's use this time productively:
1) Let's verify exactly how much time we have to respond (@alexa.smith?)
2) Let's immediately vote no on this proposal to make sure this doesn't get executed right now
3) Let's get a response back to Nintendo that the community will be happy to vote "yes" to remove the canister as long as they're the ones to submit the proposal (complete with well-written language on why this is the only solution to remove the canister *anyway*, and instructions on how to get their neuron set up) (@alexa.smith would you be able to route this message to the right node provider / Nintendo legal team?)
4) Let's help Dfinity see this as an *opportunity to onboard a major corporate neuron submitting an NNS proposal*, and ask for their support and cooperation with Nintendo's legal team (@alexa.smith might Dfinity help?)
5) Let's plan on re-introducing this proposal in 3-4ish days if we don't hear back in this time (this brings us right back to where we are right now, but we'd be 3-4 days smarter)

We can do all these things without making *any* rushed decisions about censorship / takedown / acceptable use policies, legal responsibilities, jurisdictions, node provider protections, etc *and* make a concerted effort taking a step in the decentralized internet direction.

This is what the NNS was built for, let's use this as an opportunity to encourage adoption!

Agree, sounds like a right thing to do so far.
I am voting no also.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2021-12-08 04:57:28 UTC | #48

How did Nintendo even know what node provider was hosting the canister?

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2021-12-08 05:29:19 UTC | #49

Aren't canister supposed to be hosted by subnets that are created from multiple different node providers in different regions?

-------------------------

CashBowie | 2021-12-08 05:34:56 UTC | #50

Just listened to 1 hr 16 mins of :fire: convo on Spaces hosted by Jordan and Bob... the level of thoughtfulness and caution was remarkable. 

Important to remember. There's a difference between policing [as a community] copyright infringement and illegal content verses censorship and freedom of speech. 

FYI. Since DFINITY is abstaining from voting, I did not :raised_back_of_hand: to speak... as many of us at DFINITY are mindful not to influence the discussion, and allow the community to govern. 

Seeing people spend their personal time to discuss was :exploding_head:... this is something we all hoped for as we incubated the Internet Computer, and this is just the beginning. Stoked!

Alixthe | 2021-12-08 05:37:32 UTC | #51

Thanks for the high-level summary of the issue at hand @alexa.smith which has certainly generated a fair amount of comments.

Based purely on the summary, I am unable to make an informed decision as to which way to vote (notwithstanding that a casual onlooker will most likely say that this is a blatant misuse of Nintendo intellectual property and vote to remove the canister without further thought).

If there was an option to vote 'Abstain' and receive voting rewards at the same time, I would most certainly do so. However, given this is not an available option, I have voted 'No' purely on the basis of insufficient information and/or supporting documentation to make an informed decision.

I would assume the node provider may consider taking further steps (in addition to informing DF) in dealing with the take down notice including seeking legal advice based on the node providers' legal jurisdiction.

With regards to the lack of information and/or supporting documentation, it would be useful if the community has access to some or all of the following information: 

1. A high level summary of preliminary legal advice (even if it is a simple legal opinion ~ better than nothing) received (if any) regarding the take-down notice (assuming that the node provider has taken this action in addition to notifying Dfinity Foundation). This could prove useful in the future regarding take down notices which may be less clear-cut.

2. Copy of actual 'take down notice' made against node provider (information could be redacted if required) (we are currently making a decision based on the 'take down notice' but has anyone (apart from Dfinity Foundation and the node provider) actually seen the notice?)

3. Who is the owner of the canister and does the node provider have the right / authority to remove the canister? (does the node provider simply provide a platform for the canister to be hosted with the canister ultimately being owned by the canister developer?)

4. Was the node provider the correct entity being served the notice and does the node provider have any legal obligation to comply based on its jurisdiction?

5. If the node provider refuses to comply and is eventually sued, does the node provider have any recourse against Dfinity Foundation?

6. How did Nintendo know which Node Provider to target and is there any recourse (in terms of say privacy) against anyone for such information being provided to Nintendo?

7. Was the the Nintendo canister uploaded for private use and not meant to be shared? This is on the assumption that we do not currently know the identity of the developer who created the canister given that he/she did not appear to personally share the canister ID on social media (but instead it was found by members of the community and distributed that way). 
 
8. Sometimes, there could be procedural defects in notices and/or service of such notices which if put to a Court will render such notices null and void.  Has this been considered?

9. What fiduciary duties (if any) and/or legal obligation(s) does the node provider have to the canister owner and vice versa?

Either way, we do not have sufficient information to make an informed decision. 

With the lack of further and better information, perhaps the NNS proposal could be framed in a way to provide time (say in line with the notice period given by the takedown notice) for the node provider to receive preliminary legal advice on the matter and/or for the developer of the Nintendo canister to either comply with the request made by Nintendo to the node provider and/or provide a reason(s) as to why he/she believes that there is no reason to comply with Nintendo's request in removing the canister.

I believe we should not set a precedent on voting on issues based on gut instinct, lack of information and lack of time more so when it is dealing with legal issues that we may not fully understand.

If this canister is deleted, it could create a “Streisand Effect” where people upload many copies.

Imagine how many copyright claims AWS or YouTube gets. They employ huge teams to handle the requests. And trolls often send fake DMCA notices to take down stuff they don’t like. Verification of copyright claims can be complex, involving legal expertise across multiple countries.

This censorship will make headlines and damage ICP’s reputation in the broader crypto community, even if it is the right thing to do.

With all that said, the network must protect its node providers. The time to act, IMO, is when there is credible legal threat to node providers. The alternative would be to effectively lose all nodes in certain countries, which harms the performance characteristics of the network.

So is there a credible legal threat? Could Nintendo sue an Ethereum node operator if someone painstakingly uploaded a game to the Eth blockchain? If no, is the IC substantially different from Ethereum in the nature of data hosting?

Lastly, this won’t be the last controversial censorship vote. If the IC is to grow to a large network of thousands of apps, it will need a dedicated team of people handling the onslaught of requests.

-------------------------

neeboo | 2021-12-08 06:02:47 UTC | #53

Should some canister be shut down because it is violating US law?  What would happen to those BTC wallet canisters running in a few months after, should they be shut down due to some government's regulation?

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-08 06:10:13 UTC | #54

The question is not what the IC community thinks of US law, rather do we want to have node providers in the US. If yes, the network must protect those node providers from credible legal threats.

I imagine the NNS will put up with US copyright law if that is what it takes to use US data centers. However I can see other scenarios where the juice isn’t worth the squeeze. For instance if China jailed node providers for hosting anti-CCP content, I bet the IC would still refuse to censor and accept not having nodes in China.

-------------------------

Seba | 2021-12-08 06:16:32 UTC | #55

The infinite number of emulators that are on web 2.0 are accepted by Nintendo?? C'mon...
I voted NO for this one

-------------------------

cyaolong | 2021-12-08 06:34:08 UTC | #56

Nintendo should hold ICP to engage in this vote, making their sound in a DAO & IC way. 
But on the other hand, what if the contents are about child abuse, sex, denying history or something like that? We should set up a series of content rules to give it a consensus standard by IC proposals like what a DAO will do.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 06:35:17 UTC | #57

I agree that we should vote no and postpone the vote. We need more information about this, as others are calling for.

Can we see the DMCA notice? Which node operator was contacted and why? Does Nintendo understand that asking a single node operator to take down content does not solve their problem?

Explaining to them the NNS and encouraging them to get involved in governance seems like a good thing to do, though I'm not sure how keen they will be to do something outside of the normal legal process they probably often go through.

Let's postpone this, we simply don't have enough information nor a solid process in place and we're overreacting far too quickly.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-08 06:58:31 UTC | #58

I’ve honestly never heard of Nintendo being accepting of any N64 emulator so this doesn’t surprise me

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 07:04:11 UTC | #59

The developer has removed the Super Mario 64 game: https://culg2-qyaaa-aaaai-qa7sa-cai.raw.ic0.app/

Should DFINITY vote no to put an end to the proposal?

I think it's time to regroup and prepare for a future event.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-08 07:04:04 UTC | #60

I would argue it isn’t about what we want but what we have. If I just go off of the visual appearance of the node map it would seem like we have half our nodes in the U.S and the other half in Europe.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-08 07:05:47 UTC | #61

Wow! Perhaps in the future we could have a dedicated announcement channel where these types of notices can be posted for a period of time before any proposals are submitted.

dfisher | 2021-12-08 07:19:10 UTC | #62

It appears to me that some things are not possible for neuron holders to judge and enforce fairly. I personally would have no idea on how to judge the validity of the Nintendo claim. It seems the creator took it down but he could have easily decided not to. 

We have a complex web of institutions that create and uphold our laws. We don't just put everything to a vote to all citizens. We have politicians, lawyers, and judges, ie. experts. We have also have representative democracy. 

Right now liquid democracy is simple and good enough as the Internet Computer is gaining traction. But I would imagine that for the IC to completely re-invent the internet and become a true global utility folks much smarter than me will need to think about how to rearchitect the governance system of the NNS to incorporate governments in takedowns of illegal activity. I just don't think having neuron holders vote on these issues which they are totally unqualified for makes any sense at all.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-08 07:21:15 UTC | #63

One takeaway from this is that while Liquid Democracy tech could be the replacement for a legislature, it can't be the replacement for a judiciary. In order to live up to its vision, the IC will need both, because Separation of Powers is a crucial principle in any working democracy.

If they don't want to host it, maybe email the source to one of us so we can host it and then blackhole the canister? Just kidding...

Alexa's prompt to the community, the consideration of an independent review board, this should now be discussed... will the IC be reactive, proactive, or dismissive of moral and ethical obligations?

The apparently insurmountable issue of different Nations' Laws can be overcome by referencing the United Nations' Charters, which Nations' reference when updating their own Laws. Some Nations do it better than others, of course, but that shouldn't be a sticking point for a new organisation looking for guiding principles.

-------------------------

NickM | 2021-12-08 08:33:02 UTC | #69

My opinion regarding the above is as follows:

The IC should be Proactive, funding an Independent Review Board (IRB) which has a remit to challenge content and inform relevant authorities, based upon findings weighed against the United Nations' Charters. This would allow an IRB to act independently of authoritarian and corrupt governments, to hold the moral and ethical high ground when challenged.

Generally speaking, people who go down the crypto rabbit hole and stay believe this technology will empower everyone to become self sovereign. 

Self sovereignty is a Right I can get behind, but not at the expense of others' Liberty.

I think the discussion is far from over. If you would like my **PERSONAL** opinion on this matter, I am available until 22:00 (CET). I can provide comments on my personal experiences of working behind the scenes at a node provider, and how this could influence a node provider (from **MY** perspective).

To clarify once again, I will **NOT** be speaking on behalf of (any) node provider(s).

We are building an ethics committee to be a neuron operator within our SNS. Perhaps we will need a legal committee to do the same :thinking: But as you say, if the SNS is not in place, or unresponsive, the NNS may need to step in.

The content is no longer on canister culg2-qyaaa-aaaai-qa7sa-cai. Because there is thus no reason to delete the canister, the foundation has voted reject on proposal 33379 to ensure that the canister will not get deleted. To me, the owner of the canister removing the content in question is the ideal outcome. Thank you u4u53-bhmqg-vc4mk-abm2u-mo6kz-jptpk-icn6i-gpkve-5b57m-m4cn5-jqe!

We are tremendously happy about the amount and quality of the interaction within the community on this, thanks everyone for participating! This is really great to see and, personally, made my day!

While the particular situation is now resolved, the problem of dealing with copyrighted materials as well as other types of problematic content still exists in principle. All of this needs to be further explored, discussed, and solutions to be found. The foundation is working on lessons learned from this and will propose solutions to the community, in particular in this forum, and continues to looks towards to the community for participation on ideas, solutions, and lively discussions and what are the best ways forward. 

Thank you all!

I agree that node operators should be shielded and not involved in any governance/decisions. 

My question to you as a node operator. Do you have any control whatsoever over any canister hosted on your servers? I thought node operators have access (until enclaves are in place) to a canister state but  not sure what exactly they're able to see or do?

Would be interesting to know what kind of authority a node operator has.

-------------------------

free | 2021-12-08 10:39:58 UTC | #78

Personal opinion below. I work for DFINITY, but I do not have any authority to speak for them.

As I understand it, copyright holders need to consistently enforce their copyright if they want to enforce it at all. I.e. if Nintendo were to turn a blind eye to a canister hosting a game they own the copyright of, anyone in the future could point to that as proof that the copyright is not being enforced and be legally allowed to do the same.

I'm not a US citizen and not particularly familiar with US laws regarding copyright enforcement (such as the DMCA), but my understanding is that if a node operator does not respond to a takedown notice, the copyright owner can simply escalate to the data center (note that node providers are not actual data centers, just a couple of racks of servers in someone else's datacenter) and ask them to essentially unplug said servers.

Meaning that if the NNS (or whatever judiciary is put in place alongside the NNS acting as legislature) decided to ignore a takedown notice, this would likely result in all nodes in the US getting unplugged one rack at a time over a period of a few weeks. Possibly in other US friendly countries too. All this with no need for costly legal action on the part of the copyright holder, but merely sending a handful of DMCA notices.

The canister controller taking down the respective canisters themselves is of course the ideal outcome, but this cannot be the expected outcome except in a very small number of cases. Meaning that we, as a community need to put something in place to deal with this type of issues all the while weighing.the possible consequences against the benefits.

I can sympathize with both sides of the argument (taking down illegal content; and censorship protection) and I definitely don't have a solution for more gnarly cases (e.g., to pick a random example, marginal holocaust denial), but my personal opinion is that a clear cut copyright case is not worth the consequences. I am oftentimes the person who likes to see (a small corner of) the world burn, but in this particular case, I believe it would be exceedingly anticlimactic.

(To address one comment above: no, DFINITY doesn't know the identity of canister controllers. And it also didn't in this case. Someone somewhere (e.g. the exchange that sold them the ICP) might, but DFINITY is not privy to that information. In (not so) extreme cases, the canister controller might even come in the possession of ICP/cycles without ever having to divulge their identity to anyone. e.g. by getting an NFT drop and selling it.)

I believe that you are referring to Trademarks disputes, whereas some expectation of enforcing your TM in the realm of your business exists. Copyright is "given" when the original work is created, and is valid until it expires, regardless of any attempts to enforce it or not.

-------------------------

free | 2021-12-08 11:08:05 UTC | #80

Regarding the technical aspects: node operators currently have no control over what canisters run on their nodes. So it may be exceedingly unfair to them to let them deal with the fallout. In the future, when secure enclaves / randomization / node replacement make it possible for a node operator to plausibly deny any wrongdoing, this may change, but for now it's a pretty clear case of "canister X runs on node Y (among other nodes) belonging to node provider Z".

Regarding how much time is available to respond to a takedown notice: while someone pointed out above that one legally has 7 days to respond, it is quite likely that the notice will be served to the data center (not the node provider) and the data center may want a generous amount of time to deal with the issue should the node provider not (be able to) do it themselves. So we cannot assume the full 7 days are available to make a decision: the data center can set an arbitrarily short deadline.

Finally, trying to onboard a copyright owner onto the NNS, while nice for the community is totally unnecessary for the copyright owner. They already have a legal framework that they operate within and probably don't want to invest any more time and resources than strictly necessary. So them serving DMCA notices is by far the path of lowest resistance for the time being. I've worked at YouTube for a long time (and specifically on the technical side of interacting with content owners) and I know first hand the difficulties they had and they years they spent convincing content owners to (1) use Content ID to enforce their copyright (as opposed to just taking legal action against YouTube)  and (2) once content owners did make use of Content ID, to monetize content rather than take it down. This on a platform where the content owners stood to make some non-negligible profit at minimum effort. I don't think the IC is in any position to ask copyright holders to use the NNS to resolve copyright disputes. Not even if a simple DMCA-like process was put in place by the community.

I believe it is not appropriate that NNS decides about these things. People vote wrong when they risk nothing. Nobody is sensible if it is not their own canister. If the question was: "This is your canister, do you take it down?" then they might respond differently.

It would have been better if we had a "Jury dApp". Like the NNS but specialised on cases.

With Reviewers (stake ICP & get rewards for voting in cases), Reporters & Canister Holders. All anonymous and transparently decentralised. No KYC except on the reporters who should reveal they are indeed the owners.

When reported, owners check dApp and reply in X hours. Jury (e.g. 10 random reviewers) takes decision.

Canister holders could pay the fees for each case they receive if they want their case go through the jury dApp instead of the NNS. And only for cases of clear copyrights infringement with reporter submitting clear evidence about their identity and report (not just a scammer reporting from a fake email address) or illicit content i.e. raping, crime, pedophilia, necrophilia etc.

For reference I receive tens of reports every day on my platforms and most are scams. People who benefit from taking others' content down. Another example, imagine a Youtuber reporting another Youtuber for nudity so he decreased competition.

AWS FYI doesn't take any VM down. They send you notification about the report and is up to the owner to clean if there is violation. Or if AWS receives a legal action of course.

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2021-12-08 11:26:50 UTC | #83

I will pop in and give my opinion on this as this is more serious a matter than most people in the thread seem to realize.

First of all I appreciate the problem this created for the node operator. It's bad for them and happy this developer removed the Mario kart emulator on their own so nobody faces any immediate legal trouble.

But this highlights a much much bigger problem with the internet computer.

A decentralized censorship-resistant network should be exactly that. (1) decentralized and (2) censorship resistant.

From what we see here the NNS can vote to remove a canister. So it's not censorship resistant.
It's also not decentralized since running a node has such insane hardware requirements and is not supposed to be run by normal users.

And here we see the result of the lack of decentralization. With nodes being so few and easy to find you just serve DMCA notices and then they are forced to go to court or shutdown. An easy choice for the node operator.

What's more with the voting mechanism and KYC of ICP holders you can actually go after individual users who vote to ignore a DMCA takedown (or vote for anything that goes against the law of some nation state). This is terrible.

At that point you are no longer working on a decentralized censorship resistant network. You have recreated a more complex, less performant version of AWS.

I don't know if this is possible, but I urge the developers of the network to think long and hard on the direction they want to take the internet computer. And try to make the two following long term changes:

1. Enable home users across the globe to run their own nodes. Make it into a truly decentralized network.
2. Remove the ability to censor canisters via on-chain governance. The reasons why this should not exist were outlined above.

-------------------------

Cadmeos | 2021-12-08 11:51:26 UTC | #84

Heh, I think that kleros.io may solve this problem at a large scale.

Gabriel | 2021-12-08 12:16:31 UTC | #85

I don't think you quite understand how decentralisation works. 

The NNS was built exactly for that, so people can vote on proposals, kick out ill intent canisters ( child pornograpy, denying holocaust etc) or are you happy for the IC to just host anything?

Censorship resistant in this case means 1 entity can't take your app down without a debate, which exactly what is happening here. If Mario Kart was on AWS, it would've already been taken down without further notice. 

"It’s also not decentralized since running a node has such insane hardware requirements and is not supposed to be run by normal users." This has been discussed a thousands of times. If you'd like IC to be fully decentralised but fast as a potato then sure, badlands will provide that. But what would you choose? Host your app on a raspberry pi on some shady internet connections or on a enterprise server with redundant internet and power generators?  Take your pick.

-------------------------

LefterisJP | 2021-12-08 12:31:53 UTC | #86

Cute.

> The NNS was built exactly for that, so people can vote on proposals, kick out ill intent canisters ( child pornograpy, denying holocaust etc) or are you happy for the IC to just host anything?

A censorship resistant system should be able to host anything **without fear of censorship** otherwise it's not censorship resistant. Once you open that can of worms it's done. What should be censored for one person is fair game for another. What's legal in one country is illegal for another.

The power of a censorship-resistant decentralized system is to be above all that and to simply make it impossible to censor. As long as the ability to censor is built in the system it will be used. Both for things such as the ones you mentioned which are indeed bad, but also for other things which are not bad but the powers that be at the time deem to be illegal.

> This has been discussed a thousands of times. If you’d like IC to be fully decentralised but fast as a potato then sure, badlands will provide that. But what would you choose? Host your app on a raspberry pi on some shady internet connections or on a enterprise server with redundant internet and power generators? Take your pick.

I would host my app in a truly decentralized system. I would envision such a system be comprised of thousand of raspberry pis (or well more powerfull - but stil home-grade hardware) all around the world. Not in a few servers that can be taken down by DMCA requests. I thought that the IC was trying to be such a system. This debacle shows me that's not the case.

Delighted to see this point made so succinctly. 

In a previous career I operated within a completely transparent framework for the purpose of transforming a failing organisation. Challenge could come from any stakeholder at any time. It was liberating. Everyone self regulated for the betterment of the community. Government agencies allowed 3 years for improvement and local agencies 2 years... we did it in one and a half.

Let's not make the IC a next gen Dark Web, but one within which people can openly thrive.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 13:50:31 UTC | #89

No you don't understand how it works. It means things are really, really hard to change/censor because of the coordination between many stakeholders required to make changes. Coordination is required because power is so dispersed.  

If someone can send a DCMA request to the foundation and a day later the content is taken down, you do not have a decentralised system. You've got AWS masquarading as a decentralised system just because there's coin voting.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 13:52:50 UTC | #90

The NNS is not democratic. It's the equivalent of shareholder voting. States will see this and bring it under the control just like they've brought Facebook to heal. At that point, there's no point to The IC's consensus mechanism. It's needless overhead.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-08 13:57:27 UTC | #91

@Ciaran I was just coming here to post about the need to calculate voting power differently for these types of proposals. Then I saw your post.

I don’t like the idea of large neurons with massive VP being able to make content moderation decisions.

Could we require that any neuron voting on these types of proposal be boosted via people party participation? Then we give each neuron equal voting power?

-------------------------

I find it fairly mindblowing/disturbing to see the lack of understanding of the value proposition of censorship resistant systems to the extent that it makes me question what is the point of The IC. 

Those of us that have been around this space long enough are well aware that blockchains can and will enable people to do bad things. The deal with the devil that we made was that the good things that emanate from systems not being controlled by powerful entities like big tech, or embroiled in geopolitical power struggles between states, are empowering to all individuals, the *vast* majority of whom are good. The net effect of blockchains is that they're overwhelmingly a force for good. 

It's analagous to the encryption debates. You can plan a murder or send child porn using encrypted messaging and the person that designed the encryption algorithm can't intervene to stop you. The entities hosting the content can't know about it and thus can't stop you either. But most people aren't murderers or paedophiles and they benefit from encryption every day of their lives. It secures their financial transactions and maintains their human right to privacy. If you weaken that encryption to try catch the .01% of the population that do these bad things you end up reducing the autonomy of the 99.9% because there are powerful state and criminal forces out there that have readily shown they will exploit these weaknesses to do bad things. That's a really bad trade! 

The same principal exists here. Censorship resistance empowers 100% of people. If you start trying to govern what's acceptable content or not, you both introduce the possibility for powerful actors to game the system for their benefit, along with the possiblity of becoming eternally mired in politics because what is acceptable or not is guaranteed to be highly subjective. When both of those things inevitably happen, governments won't just stand by and watch, they'll come to take control just like they came to bring Facebook to heal. 

At that point, we'll just have recreated Web 2.0 and we'd have to ask ourselves what on earth is the point of chainkey tech, etc if it's just going to be routinely over-ridden by corporate and state interests? 

If IC stakeholders don't see the light on this issue, I predict a fork of The IC that won't have formal governance procedures - or at least won't be dominated coin voting - to emerge and quickly out-compete the IC because like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it will minimise governance in order to maximise censorship-resistance and in doing so, maximise social scalability.

Like [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html), I think on-chain governance is a failed experiment and The IC should be immediately looking into improving its governance.

Interesting points. Thank you

FWIW - I myself am new to the blockchain space, and I've noticed that many of the other IC community members are as well. It's good to have people like you and @lastmjs share this history with us. 

I am interested to see if this "deal with the devil" holds up in the long term as more mainstream adoption takes place. I'm not trying to suggest that it shouldn't; but I do find it hard to believe that everyone will be so willing to accept a deal that they did not make themselves.

As for your last comment; isn't that what we are doing right now? Everyone I've seen chatting about this in the community channels is trying to figure out how to do that. And even before the vote was cancelled the general consensus was that we needed more time to figure out our next steps.

Minor idea: In circumstances like this the node provider itself  could comply with the notice without the IC itself removing the canister if:

(1) The NNS votes to change which subnet the node provider is on.
(2) The NNS votes to change which subnet the canister is on.

@Ciaran you're doing something similar as this famous attempt to disprove the evolution theory with the broken watch thought-experiment. I don't think it works like that. There are **millions** of use cases where a service would benefit from being community owned and governed and does not care to be censorship-resistant in every single jurisdiction. _This_ is where you need IC and not AWS. It's not all black and white and not everyone is into libertarianism and anarchy.

It's funny to bring up Facebook, since it's a good example of why it's sometimes necessary for (democratic) state powers to intervene, even where some entity considers itself "good".

Radical all-or-nothing narratives are not helping. There are no simple solutions to complex questions of organising society. Everything ultimately is a trade-off and compromise that has to be checked and rebalanced constantly.

Although the decision is moot because the canister's creator has taken the canister down, we must continue this discussion. This will happen again, and soon. There is a good chance that people will start uploading "bad" content to the IC just to see what happens. Will the community delete it? Or is it actually censorship resistant, with the one exception of intellectual property violations? 

One thing we should keep in mind here is that moderation is an attack vector. People who want to see the IC fail--e.g., people who have invested in "competing" projects--could start mass posting content to the IC that impinges on the intellectual property of some multi-national corporation. Moreover, they could send takedown notices for applications that don't actually violate anyone's intellectual property, with the hope that node providers won't actually know/care whether it's true. Are we going to start going through potentially hundreds of claims a day to determine what is actually infringement and what is not?

Imagine a decentralized YouTube, whether running on the IC or some other network. It's a lot of data and bandwidth, such that a successful global app pretty much has to run in data centers. You aren't going to get the necessary performance characteristics from household nodes. Such a network has a bigger target on its back due to the data center presence. This is the target market the IC is aiming for, IMO: dapps that household node networks can't do.

To reject the viability of a decentralized YouTube merely because some censorship must be applied to protect node providers is to make perfection the enemy of progress. 

Yes, the governance must be overhauled but at least we can do that, as opposed to giant tech corporations.

However I agree with some other posters that improving plausible deniability and reducing content moderation responsibility is the best path forward. But I don't think we will ever get to 100% not legally responsible. The stronger the will, ex with child porn, the more forceful the legal system will be, and the more responsible node providers will be in the eyes of fiat legal systems.

I think it’s telling (and reassuring) that Dfinity has abstained from direct intervention. That alone gives me a lot of faith in the future of this project. 

IP infringement in this case is about as clearly black and white as it can be. Nintendo owns the copyright, the game has not been modified in any way, it is a clear violation. I should hope that in the future the community chooses to protect IP rights of small creators, something that is woefully neglected by the big companies—that is one area that ICP can shine. 

Clearer lines for moderation will need to be drawn sooner than later, and I think in light of the recent Twitter purge, we need to be mindful of the nuance between freedom of speech and piracy.

Community ownership (eg cooparatives) existed long before blockchains. Hell a corporation qualifies as community ownership. These things exist everywhere (eg AWS) now so I don't know what you're talking about. You don't need The IC for community ownership. 

Blockchains can facilitate community ownership outside of national legal structures but *only* if they're censorship resistant. If they're not, and there is active governance, states will quickly move to control that governance because disputes will inevitably arise and end up in state courts, forcing the states to act.
