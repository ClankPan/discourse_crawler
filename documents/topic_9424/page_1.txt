@alexa.smith It is not very clear to me as to why Dfinity decided, at first, to abstain on this particular vote. 

This, of course, is in light of the fact that it did vote, eventually,  no after the content was removed.

The NNS making or not making a decision is just one part of the issue.

The ICP operates within society's existing constructs and influences.  

Deciding to take a node or data centre offline is a business decision that will be informed by the operator's assessment of legal risk.  It is possible to weaponize a takedown process by dropping a copyrighted work on the ICP and then relying on a large corporation with a well funded legal team to send DMCA takedown notices.  This is the ICP crypto equivalent to swatting. 

Node operators and data centre operators likely will want to wash their hands of any legal risk.  A malicious actor, dropping canisters containing offending copyrighted content could place a real chill on any ICP node or data centre operator housing nodes who is in a country that provides copyright protections and mechanisms. 

Nodes being yanked will cause issues.  A node would have to be ressurected and join a different subnet without the offending content in order for them to continue operating and earning rewards.  This is an operational complexity and not very appealing.  Nodes operators need to be shielded from this type of barrage.

It was necessary because Facebook is a massive corporation beholden to its shareholders. The idea with decentralised systems is that they're beholden only to their users. 

It's precisely that everything is a trade-off that it's best to stay out of politics. If you don't you'll get dragged back into an intermediated, nation-state regulated system.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 16:13:25 UTC | #108

I'm not so sure this logic stands. Finance is *much* more heavily regulated than social media/content platforms yet states haven't tried to marginalise Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Historically states only really involve themselves in the governance of things when there are locii of power. If there's no locii of power they simply attempt to mediate externalities from certain systems in other ways.

talkingant | 2021-12-08 16:16:30 UTC | #109

It comes down to, who do you want running YouTube? A US tech corporation, or a blockchain governance system? The latter can be designed more fair and transparent, with the option to not comply (at the cost of reducing node presence).

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 16:18:33 UTC | #110

I don't see the difference between a globally owned (via shares on the Nasdaq) US tech corporation making censorship decisions and a globally owned IC via ICP holders making censorship decisions TBH. What's the difference in your view?

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-08 16:20:24 UTC | #111

US tech corporation has to comply with US law. Blockchain network has option not to. There is also more governance options available to implement, like liquid democracy, quadratic voting, egalitarian voting, futarchy, full decision transparency, etc.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 16:21:57 UTC | #112

Spot on. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. We have to potential to devolve into Lord of the Flies here.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 16:23:39 UTC | #113

I think it's really naive to think the US will stand by and watch the NNS grow powerful. They'll allow the IC grow powerful. They won't allow the NNS. It won't have the option not to comply. They'll either find the power brokers in the NNS or force all CEXs like Coinbase to remove ICP or be cut off from the dollar.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-08 16:24:30 UTC | #114

I think it's really naive to not even try to stand up to the US.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are working just fine. They're managing that by staying out of politics. By being credibly neutral.

talkingant | 2021-12-08 16:27:21 UTC | #116

No one has tried to sue Ethereum node operators for hosting copyrighted content, but theoretically it could happen just the same as IC. It's just more expensive to upload data to Eth blockchain so it hasnt happened out of practicality. But you are drawing a philosophical line in the sand that doesnt exist between Eth nodes and IC nodes.  

Blockchain networks are anti-fragile and I'm sure of gov tried to take down IC, we would go full badlands (household nodes).

-------------------------

NickM | 2021-12-08 16:39:21 UTC | #117

Is it possible that the diversity of the internet computer's capacity is complicating the issue, ie the question requires framing?

What should the IC do about content that is publicly posted/displayed without the owners permission? 

Whether it is encrypted or not is a moot point because it is publicly accessible.

-------------------------

jelenad | 2021-12-08 17:13:10 UTC | #118

Qualifying this statement by putting 'democratic' in parenthesis is precisely where this argument falls apart. 

Facebook has been on a massive global lobbying campaign to pander to national governments on all sides of the "moral spectrum" in order to have the permission to continue to operate in those jurisdictions. While Facebook lobbyists have successfully convinced democratic governments that they are willing to combat fake news, mental health crises, etc, they've also successfully managed to convince governments in Brazil, Myanmar, and elsewhere, that their platform should continue to operate, even though its widely known that it's used to facilitate propaganda on behalf of tyrannical leaders (i.e. WhatsApp chat groups used to spread Bolsanaro's message) or even genocidal acts (video streams of live killings in Myanmar). 

Like others in this discussion, I am afraid that the IC will be weaponized by oppressive nationalist regimes and democratic states alike, by creating a fractured governance landscape where node providers are forced to cow toe to the whims of governments / regulators and even potentially getting embroiled in geopolitical feuds (just like what we see with Big Tech). 

This argument isn't about being pro or anti libertarianism. It's really a concern rooted with the prevailing MO of Big Tech / political hegemonic powers and seeing that those structures are not replicated in Web 3. It appears that this proposal may very well set a precedent that makes it easier for communities to censor. As bad as Web2 governance is, it's possible that this proposal would exacerbate those issues in Web 3.  

iiuc, this proposal combined with liquid on-chain governance would make it relatively seamless to take nodes offline, which can make it much easier for bad actors to act quickly outside of existing legal/political systems which always require some elements of negotiations around tradeoffs. Obviously, the Foundation holding majority voting power could prevent this, but then that opens up a major problem for the role of the Foundation (which should be to steward but not to be the governor-of-last-resort).

toby2911 | 2021-12-08 17:42:21 UTC | #119

I personally think the ICP needs to define its value proposition first and then provide rules/government that support this proposition. Once these rules are created, I think it should be incredibly hard to change them and they should be the same across geographic jurisdictions. Changing the rules over time and space changes the value proposition of the ICP.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-08 18:09:34 UTC | #120

I wanted to share my experience with this issue. Last spring/summer, I was contemplating starting a node of my own. I have a unique opportunity to host one in a secure facility in my jurisdiction, as I have hosted servers there for many years, and built a good relationship.

During my due diligence I identified this as an issue, that I would not fully understand what content I am hosting, and that if an authority came at me, I would have no other option than to shut the entire node down, as I would not be able to suspend the individual bad actor.

I am not the arbitrator of truth, but if you’re going to put out 100’s of thousands of dollars through leasing, you need to know you will be able to recoup that investment so you are not left holding the bag. This reality means I need to somehow be able to control if I am working within the laws of my jurisdiction. I am not a billionaire, so I do not have the resources to personally fend off large corporations and governments based on principal, to backup a canister which might be in the end a bad actor.

My opinion is that there should be some kind of ‘network policy enforcement’ team, that can act fast, governed by a set of rules (terms of service) set/updated by NNS votes. I don’t want to vote on every DCMA complaint but the smaller IP owners that are not huge Nintendo, they should have rights as well, and not just get overlooked. There could be an appeal process for suspended canisters, that can confirm if the enforcement process went properly, which would go back to an NNS vote, while the canister is suspended. This could lead to more granular outcomes, rather than just remove or allow, the community could tell a canister to act differently before turning back on.

Bad actors are out there and WILL push the limits. There are issues that can’t wait for an NNS vote, like if someones life is in immediate danger, and we should respect that. But we should also respect that community, moderated by the NNS, should be OK with every decision made by the enforcement team and there may be times the community wants to stand up against corporate/governmental bullying and that should be allowed as well. In those cases, before un-suspending the canister, a node operator facing heat should be able to move the canister out of their jurisdiction, so they have a leg to stand on.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 18:53:46 UTC | #121

Dominic was asked very specifically about issues of this nature on a panel with Joe Lubin. 

By definition, this is not a "new question" by any stretch of this imagination. Suggesting otherwise already casts doubt on the intentions behind your writing this here. 

In fact, I raised even more dangerous issues repeatedly with one of your product managers in a private conversation. I was told that your legal team was devoting substantial resources to the matter (well before the takedown request that spawned this whole debate).

In summary, it appears that the DFINITY Foundation's response to one ounce of backlash of the type that you KNEW was coming (and *explicitly built the network architecture to survive*) is to immediately float a proposal for 1984 on the "Open Internet".

Why don't we just spin up a "Ministry of Truth" neuron and make it official, huh?

I support Dapp creators/local ecosystems being able to set their own terms of service and be as censorship-happy as they like, especially so that such developers can be exposed in an atmosphere of competition.

Any censorship capabilities that scale are, to put it rather technically, @#&@#$&@#$ bullshit. 

By even suggesting this, you have singlehandedly managed to destroy in roughly 180 seconds every piece of trust that you have gained with me over several months. 

Let big brands war over acquiring enough ICP to try and take various canisters down, and it'll be what the economics of the Internet Computer are meant to be. 

The blockchain that is supposedly being built to withstand an electromagnetic pulse attack is somehow incredibly threatened by a complaint from Nintendo -- I guess I'll just mull that over awhile.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 19:04:56 UTC | #122

And in response to @Deepsea and for those who want a more constructive response than what I posted above, I can say that I'd personally take a look at donating to some kind of lobbying and legal campaign to exempt node providers and the Foundation from any liability for content served than I ever would at backing this kind of thing proposed.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 19:04:15 UTC | #123

And to those who believe that the legal code of various countries provides an effective callback function on this, there's that whole history of slavery and that Holocaust thing or the history of the court system in Soviet Russia under Stalin which kind of blow a hole in that viewpoint...

And in the modern day, of course, things like this:

skilesare | 2021-12-08 19:04:50 UTC | #124

Why don't we just let node providers blacklist canister's themselves and let the system plug the holes by moving content to open and willing nodes?  If the content is 'bad' enough everyone will blacklist it.  If a provider becomes notorious for hosing terrorism or explorative content the NNS can remove the provider.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 19:06:06 UTC | #125

At this point, the argument against that would be because you have the Foundation acting as the gatekeeper for node onboarding.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 19:18:22 UTC | #126

Social media and content platforms **do** much of the outsourced regulating of governments now -- there are multiple lawsuits against them on this very basis.

You're thinking of government as the only networked state capable of legislating -- Terms and Conditions function as the equivalent of laws in many capacities these days.

llbrunoll | 2021-12-09 14:24:23 UTC | #127

What if SciHub is hosted on IC, and an editor demands it shut down. Are we going to remove it? In the future, are we going to remove SciHub from the IC? (Don't know SciHub, read this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub](https://t.co/KRbmtKUn3D) ). Depending on what we decide to enforce as "policies to warranty copyright claims" , SciHub is something that could never live in the IC. So, imagine, web2.0 would be the heaven for open Science (not the IC).  (@ajismyid , what about Sci-hub ? For me, it is a great example of "revolutionary content that The IC should host and defend . It is about Science made available to every one, with no cost-barrier. It has been revolutionary in web2.0, and we should let it be revolutionary in web3.0 . If we bend to bib-corps , Scihub would never exist in The IC. Is that what we want? )

I am not saying it will be like that...

[quote="northman, post:26, topic:9424"]
Regarding a takedown policy, it should include:
• terrorist content;
• content that incites violence;
• hate speech;
• non-consensual sharing of intimate images; and
• child sexual exploitation content;
• cyber security issue;
• copyright infringement
• money laundering
• other criminal activity
[/quote]

It is a complex subject. It is a great opportunity to rethink censorship. If we only look into those bullets, it is kind of easy to agree to all of them. But... think about "content that incites violence" for example. Imagine if a group is calling up for protest and publishing content in IC; in such a polarized political context we all live in, how could we decide if the call-to-protest content incites violence? There will be many situations in which this "content that incites violence" will be hard to reason about, with certainty. 

(I am just trying to think about the many situations that will be hard to decide on... it is really amazing how complex it is to think about a self and fair regulated web3.0 meant to (in some sense) protect against massive censorship forces that could be unleashed by corporate+state collusion )

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 19:52:14 UTC | #128

@alexa.smith By the way, just a heads up -- The ideas you're floating directly contradict what Dominic (for those not familiar, the Foundation's own CEO) is explicitly out there telling people in interviews about the reasons for a Dapp like UniSwap to build its front-end on the Internet Computer.

When governments declare 95% of the tokens on Uni to be illegal security offerings, I guess it'll just fall within a violation of the "Acceptable Use Terms" of the IC to throw them off the network same as if they were on AWS in the first place, huh?

Or if a canister somehow finds themselves in violation of "spreading misinformation" a la Twitter censoring numerous scientific publications and Nobel Laureates these days. 

Seriously, if that's the route this whole thing is going to go, it's much easier to just create that Ministry of Truth neuron and just get the control mechanisms out there in the open. 

DFINITY was able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the top venture capitalists in the world, and not one of them wanted a detailed plan for how these issues and various conflicts were going to be handled?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-08 19:54:09 UTC | #129

I agree.  I think there needs to be a policy on each of these items, but I have deliberately not advanced a policy position.   The spectrum could be anything from do nothing, to removal, and to address who is the authority on saying a valid grievance has been put forward.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 20:32:08 UTC | #130

Oh, and here's another one -- 

Governments and central banks in many places have already launched a very negative PR campaign against Bitcoin as an "enabler of money laundering" and a "tool for terrorists" -- so what happens to the Foundation's wonderful little Bitcoin Integration when all of the sudden these Dapps and Canisters facilitating permissionless transfers find themselves on the "wrong side" of some new laws?

I mean, this whole proposal just all kinds of destructive on several fronts. 

In Australia, for example, there are laws being put forth to de-anonymize social media and directly let law enforcement agents log in to user's accounts without their permission and do all kinds of crazy things.

So now the entire Internet Identity System is in jeopardy if a sufficient number of these laws get passed?

The whole point of this damn project is to put a team of the world's best cryptographers/network architects/developers in a place where they can create something which looks the compromised systems of the world in the face and says:

"You know what? We've had enough corruption, enough abuse, enough lying, enough nepotism, and enough incompetence when it comes to leadership in the world.

"So...We're going to build what the digital world (and by extension a large portion of applications to the physical world) needs to run itself as a truly resilient system now, because you had the chance to and you chose the wrong path. 

"And if you don't like that? Fuck you. Deal with it.

"The old frame of these conversations, where somehow the scientists and the Doers and the Builders in the world are expected to kowtow to parasitic administrators/bureaucrats/fraudsters, rather than the way other way around, is over."

-------------------------

NickM | 2021-12-08 20:16:32 UTC | #131

Has the question of copyright infringement become conflated with Free Speech?

OpenChat is a working example of an encrypted communication service on the IC that currently allows anyone on the planet with internet access to converse freely with other people without fear of censorship, or even spying. In this regard, the InternetComputer is censorship resistant.

But censorship isn't the issue.

The issue is that someone's revenue earning property was made publicly and freely available without their consent.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 20:23:12 UTC | #132

-- The issue (at least that I'm reacting to) is that the default proposed solution to the copyright issue looks a lot like it would spread to many, many, many other things and create a censorship regime with a global topology rather than the local kind that you'd want to give developers and individual ecosystems the freedom to use.

Ethereum did when they rolled back the DAO.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-08 20:38:11 UTC | #136

The issue that I am understanding from your responses is : 

(a) this content moderation topic was knowable and known; much prior to the takedown notice.

(b) 100m+ was raised from top notch investors. It is not unreasonable to expect that some of those investors raised the very issue of this topic and further it is not unreasonable to assume that detailed plans were shared to combat this issue.

(c) legal teams were formed and working on appropriate responses

(d) public responses (i.e. how Uniswap front end could survive on IC) further bolster the claims in a,b & c.

(e) Therefore , at the first blush, a serious capitulation ("new question ")on a slight incursion (Nintendo takedown) to the very foundation of IC is very worrying.

That said, perhaps there was something that the foundation saw which was not anticipated? @alexa.smith ?

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-12-08 20:49:55 UTC | #137

Yes I thought that also. The DAO hack was divisive and spawned ETC. Since then has Ethereum ever rolled back or forked to reverse transactions? Despite having billions subsequently stolen in various hacks, it only happened once in response to ~15% of total eth tokens being hacked in the DAO. Why has it never happen again despite thefts of billions of dollars? Was the lesson for ethereum following that event learned that forking/governance be used in only the most exceedingly rare circumstances through network forks, or that it should be used for more frequently as a feature to prevent theft?

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-08 20:41:55 UTC | #138

I think that's a great summary of at least the issues that I'm raising -- "capitulation" is a really good word for what it seems like. 

The entire project was literally billed as "a permissionless blockchain...built to withstand nuclear war" -- between everything raised here, something really just isn't adding up to me.

It appears from the recent medium article the badlands model + People parties and secure enclaves or shuffling node membership of subnets is being positioned as the solution for those seeking maximum censorship resistance. scale of thousands of in home node providers, and not introducing NNS ICP voting for governance removals opens up wider possibilities for censorship resistance. 

For the data center nodes (non badland node providers) would provide developers with a high performance applications which are willing to sacrifice some censorship for max performance. 

>The purpose of Badlands will be to allow smart contracts to be hosted upon a network with the maximum conceivable level of decentralization, which anonymous amateurs will provide, with a low barrier to entry, and the maximum conceivable resistance to censorship.</mark> This network will have a different ethos, and will be more of a “Wild West” for smart contracts with lower throughput and storage requirements

> The unique advantages of Badlands are as follows:
> 
> * It will benefit from the maximum conceivable level of decentralization and censorship resistance, something that is held in great esteem by the blockchain community.
> * It will have its own Network Nervous System (the permissionless governance system hosted by the Internet Computer that manages and updates the network), and this will exert the will of its community in accordance with its mission and ethos, guaranteeing a more traditional “code is law” environment.
> * Even though Badlands will not be nearly as fast or efficient as the Internet Computer, it will utilize the same protocol and code, and therefore still be able to scale its capacity, serve interactive web content, interoperate with other blockchains, and run fast by traditional standards.
> * It will be fully interoperable with the Internet Computer main network.
> * It would be very difficult to destroy without turning off the internet (assuming nodes disguise their traffic).
> * It will introduce amateurs and enthusiasts to being node providers, who may then graduate to becoming professional or semi-professional node providers in the primary Internet Computer network, which is a more expensive and involved endeavor.
> 
> The sweet spot for Badlands will be hosting smart contracts that don’t require the efficiency and speed and uptime provided by the Internet Computer — as would, say, a blockchain social network, chat application, or realtime financial exchange. It will provide a Wild West for smart contracts that can directly interoperate with smart contracts on the Internet Computer. It will provide a place for those that aim to host smart contracts on a network with the maximum possible level of decentralization, while allowing amateurs to inexpensively operate nodes from home.

Here's a more practical take, let's forget about any philosophical viewpoints for a second and run through a real situation:

1 - Nefarious actors start repeatedly generating liabilities for node providers 24/7/365. 

2 - These liabilities start extending further than copyright notifications when governments start issuing takedown notices for various canisters as well. (Already happening via social media as per leaked documents. Just not widely publicized yet.) 

Tell me how any aspect of The Internet Computer survives resembling what it looks like right now in any meaningful capacity.

The explicit claim of Dominic (many times) and The Foundation has been that the network is built to stand up to this. 

The response to this incident (I don't mean your personal response, just the general proposal response) suggests that when push comes to shove, there are many, many, many points of attack which are being glossed over.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 22:03:47 UTC | #143

The sheer naivety of thinking you can just come up with some bullet points of nation state rules (which state BTW!?) you'll choose to implement with the tacit admission you won't implement others. As if this if going to be allowed fly! If there's control governments will subject it to their democracies (or whatever other system they have). The only way out of this is to not have any control.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-08 22:04:01 UTC | #144

How about this to satisfy everyone:

Some subnets have canister removal ability, some dont. Node providers choose what subnets to host and app developers choose what subnets to deploy on. Let the market decide.

In the US, EU, etc, node providers will likely only host the moderated subnets because they invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into data center hardware and don't want the risk of legal action. Apps that need the lowest latency will sacrifice some censorship risk.

Is it possible to make Canisters 'stealth' concerning 'the node(s) that have a copy of it ?   

(Could we have Stealth-Canisters? Meaning: Implement something that encrypts the information linking Canisters to Node-Providers ) 

If possible, this would take the discussion to another level. Node-Providers would never be threatened by DMCA notes ever again. The burden would go over the entire network (not on single node providers)

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-08 22:18:10 UTC | #146

Let’s say we vote to remove this type of proposal from the NNS. So no more ability to intervene like you suggest. I think I could consider something like that. But what do we do about canisters that can’t be removed by their creator?

If someone directly uploads child porn to a canister and then sets the controller to a black hole, my understanding is that it can’t be removed without this type of proposal. So what do we do in that scenario? Is that just part of our deal with the devil?

[This post was unnecessarily inflammatory so I've re-edited it to be more productive, it was a bit of a flameout but there was actual thought behind it. I've answered rebuttals in this post as well so bear in mind that subsequent responses were made to very different text]

In [this post on the cycle_dao blog](https://cycledao.xyz/posts/cycle_dao-governance-and-ecosystem-perspective) I recently discussed the cultural dominance of this forum. 

I am claiming that neither is there a universal morality that can be applied to IP, nor is there practical value to the affected parties that we might be protecting on the IC. Also that these forums are predisposed to certain perspectives that we know differ from much of the world and that we need to actively look to non-participants in these discussions to get an accurate view of the most representative path forward.

The Chinese market largely supports the counterfeit wine industry because Chinese consumers are not overly interested in whether the item they are buying is genuine or not. Chinese authorities are not highly interested in pursuing breaches of wine IP either. [This article](https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/counterfeit-bordeaux-wines-china-conviction-440392/) about the first prosecution in 10 years of a counterfeiter caught with 10,000 fake bottles resulting in an 18 month suspended sentence gives an indication of how minor the crime is considered.
The New Zealand horticulture sector is learning to accept its intellectual property will be appropriated by the Chinese sector because there is a growing practical understanding that IP has a shelf life. Regardless of law it decays and you have to develop a business model that is based on that reality.  [This is a pretty good article on the Kiwifruit industry that provides some background.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/18/kiwi-wars-the-golden-fruit-fuelling-a-feud-between-new-zealand-and-china)
In the article, the point is made that the Kiwifruit itself was originally taken from China by New Zealand growers. Another example is much of the Australian and New Zealand wine industries were built on genetic IP taken illegally from Europe in exactly the same way as the Chinese/NZ horticulture example. [I can't find a citation for this but it's a mirthful in-joke in the Australian wine industry that "all the Viognier in Heathcote, Victoria was grown from cuttings taken from Chateau Grillet in France" and I bet new Zealand growers stole it from them in turn].

After 5 years the USA withdrew from the negotiation of the TPPA free trade agreement between  Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore & Vietnam. The remaining participants signed an agreement called the CPTPP one year later.
The agreement was negotiated behind closed doors, but [this article](https://www.ajpark.com/insights/how-the-amended-tpp-agreement-will-affect-ip-in-new-zealand/)  suggests the reason it became possible to come to an agreement in the absence of the USA was likely IP terms that were then able to be removed from the agreement.

Patent law allows for different time horizons in different jurisdictions. In practical reality, IP can decay much more quickly than that. for example, in the Kiwifruit example above, New Zealand's exclusivity advantage for developing a new kiwifruit decayed in China by 50% in 9 years. 

In the case of Mario64, anyone with a computer can play it for free on the traditional web as pointed out by [llbrunoll](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/llbrunoll) [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-proposal-and-discussion-on-content-moderation/9424/170?u=arthur). We might say that Nintendo's exclusivity over Mario64 has decayed by 100%. The same can be said for every song, movie, image and TV episode streaming for free at any number of websites. Or any piece of software currently available for illegal download. What practical benefit is there to the IP rights holders to have these removed from the IC?

[ililic](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/ililic)'s point below with the big green map showing the whole world has IP legislation is solid. However, Hopefully, the above examples indicate that, at least on the ground in horticulture & Viniculture, these intellectual property rights are often ignored at industrial scale and this is tolerated by governing bodies. One might imagine that few of the countries who sign onto international property agreements actually intend to fully honour those terms. They do it to gain access to new markets and IP is treated differently in different industries under identical legislation.

The term used in this post before, a-legal, is pretty stupid. Neutrality is a better one. We should aim to be as neutral as the current internet. IP can be policed at higher levels. It cannot be managed at the protocol level. 
[*''... in the first half of 2020, Twitter reported receiving 1.6 million takedown notices for copyright infringement.''](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/twitter-music-copyright-infringement-us-representatives-1235032928/)**
Algorithmic policing has been widely criticised as ruining YouTube and ignoring "fair use" so if we want our contribution to Web3 to be any better we have to do better than that.

Anecdotally, members of the Chinese community I've spoken to have been very upset as have been members of the European community and the Blockchain-native community. 

The fact the foundation put the takedown proposal forward immediately was wrong:
A) This tacitly opinionates the Foundation in favour of US IP legislation. 
B) An NNS proposal had at the time 24 hours voting time, while a DMCA request has 7 days to be honoured.

These forums are already an opinionated arena for discussion of IC governance. They are English language, as pointed out before, sequential in nature with debate subjects interposed with one another. It's hard for a non-English speaker or person with lower reading & comprehension skills to participate or consume the discussion. These are also highly technical and populated largely by developers, primarily American. Given that the product of developers work is itself intellectual property there is an additional subject matter sympathy. 

Take a member of the Chinese community, trying to participate in this debate. They are someone for whom English is at best a second language with a different script and they are attempting to absorb the nuances of a culturally alien subject that they are probably going to vote against. Then introduce ideas of a "Constitution" - a permanent set of laws supposed to govern a global system, or a "Moderation Committee" - a group composed of community representatives to care for the content on the IC. This is pretty intense conceptual depth to expect a global audience to engage with in this format.

The point here is not to say the forum cant serve a valuable purpose. Even a primary role in IC governance. Rather that we have to acknowledge that a large group of people are excluded from this discussion and we have to go to them and ask them what they think before we come to conclusions here. Consider this point in the context of the 24 hour wait for quiet period in the NNS proposal. The necessary consultation is impossible in such a time frame. (This has obviously since changed)

There are practical considerations that will be addressed in a cycle_dao post sometime in the next week. There is a lot of research that needs to be done in the interim. The most important consideration while we figure this out is to not be like me and post wild rhetoric on developer forums :sweat_smile:

As always this is a really good post. I agree with many of your points.

But I’m surprised to see you say the debate is not worthwhile. Anyone who scrolls up can I see that I openly stated I was going to vote to adopt this proposal, but since then I’ve read all of these discussions and learned a lot. Especially from @Ciaran. But I need time to adjust my thinking for many of the reasons you point out. 

I guess what I’m saying is how would newcomers to blockchain learn if not for these types of forum debates?

Without having to make a decision on whether or not censorship should be allowed at all on the IC, I hope we can all agree that node operators should not be placed in the position of deciding which canisters they should run or drop.

That decision should be moved to either the NNS, the canister owner, or parties external to the network...or possibly no decision should be possible.

I propose we move forward with endowing node operators with plausible deniability. Please join the discussion here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/plausible-deniability-for-node-operators/9491

The Internet Computer is the first blockchain in the world that's fast, cheap, scalable, and user-friendly enough to host the mass market open internet services of the Web 3.0 future.

It's an absolute marvel of engineering, and surely one of the most significant developments in the history of computing.

Nothing that happened here takes away from that.

We are discussing this problem because an interactive, web-based video game was hosted on the Internet Computer. That's not possible on any other blockchain right now. We were merely ahead of the curve, so we hit this roadblock first.

-----

In my opinion, the first order of business is to brainstorm and implement protections for node providers. Node providers supply the hardware that make the Internet Computer possible.

Realistically, how should a node provider respond to a DMCA request? Can they say "sorry, I can't enforce this"? What kind of evidence can they provide to back up their lack of enforceability? Should we as the Internet Computer community "insure" node providers against possible losses in the event something like this happens to them?

We need to make sure that node providers never have to deal with an issue like this again.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 23:12:34 UTC | #158

Agreed. We're at a pretty damn big fork in the road here. One path leads to a globally trusted web 3.0 platform, the other to Lord of the Flies oblivion. 

I'm glad you and others like @LefterisJP and @MisterSignal have spoken out against this madness.

I would like to see all governance proposal announcements made right here in the Governance category of the forum.  It also seems appropriate for at least 1 week of deliberation before a proposal is made.  However, on something sensitive or controversial like this proposal, there is nothing like a short deadline to motivate people into action.  This is why I think we are better off with a 24 hour voting period with wait for quiet for proposals as we have now instead of extending the voting period.  It would be nice to have advanced notice of when the proposal is going to be formally submitted to the NNS, but short voting window FOMO motivates governance participation.

-------------------------

ililic | 2021-12-08 23:35:51 UTC | #160

I get that emotions are high on this topic; but there's plenty of false statements here that can be refuted by a simple google search.

>Intellectual property is a super American thing.

No. Actually it's not. Intellectual Copyright laws originated in Gregorian Britain and have been around for over three centuries. 

> It is not something the whole world accepts.

False. Below is a graphic of WTO members where The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) resides. 
![World_Trade_Organization_Members.svg|690x354](upload://kbE7RIa8dl3Q2dPSXtIu0CbMbcr.png)

>It’s worth pointing out that after 5 years of negotiation, New Zealand, Australia and many Pacific and South-East Asian nations didn’t sign the TPPA free trade agreement

This is blatantly false lol. The TPPA didn't enter into effect because Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement and it therefore never entered force. The subsequent Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership came into force on December 30, 2018 and has both New Zealand and Australia as Signatories.

> Mario64 is a significant cultural artefact and is over 25 years old. Both things could be used as an argument for placing it in the public domain.

You can't just pick an arbitrary date and hope that it applies for copyright. There are real world governance mechanisms in place that supercede your desires. In Japan, all works are protected for seventy years following publication. That includes our friendly 64 bit mustached Italian plumber. 

> Blockchain is supposed to be a-legal and exists outside jurisdiction.

Then explain why the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services just had a session on Digital Assets and the future of Finance. A-legal is a myth. Ask Ross Ulbricht or better yet Peter Sunde. 

Arthur, you and I go way back and I respect the hell out of you - but your post is pure FUD, designed to elicit an emotional reaction and not fact based at all. I'm a huge proponent of copyright reform - and I think blockchain has a ton to offer in the venue of copyright moving forward. But it doesn't change the fact that existing works are protected - pretty much globally - under existing copyright regimes.

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-08 23:43:37 UTC | #161

This is a lot of respect and submission to the status quo for someone who's participating in disruptive and paradigm shifting tech.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 23:46:56 UTC | #162

The HFSC having a session on digital assets means blockchains aren't a-legal? If Congress had a session on aliens would that mean it'd have jurisdicion over them too?

In practice Bitcoin and Ethereum are quite clearly a-legal. If they weren't miners, nodes and devs would be arrested under a RICO for running violating the Bank Secrecy Act or any other number of laws centralised entities have to adhere to.

Ross Ulbricht was the sole administrator of a website. He's not a relevant example at all.

-------------------------

ililic | 2021-12-08 23:51:34 UTC | #163

> Adjective. 
> *alegal*  
> Not within the framework or concept of the law; unrelated to concerns of legality.

No, Bitcoin and Ethereum are quite clearly the **opposite** of a-legal. For instance, one of Bitcoin's massive leaps forward was when [the IRS declared it a commodity](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/reiterating-the-irs-a-u-s-government-agency-declares-bitcoin-a-commodity/). This gave legal clarity for how BTC behaves under US tax law. With that clarity BTC began a huge bullrun that arguably hasn't stopped. 

Don't confuse alegality with front-running the legal system. Bitcoin was alegal for a few moments after Nakamoto published the white paper; but it certainly isn't alegal today, otherwise it wouldn't be the legal tender of El Salvador.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 23:55:55 UTC | #164

I'm sorry but you're the one confusing alegality. Gold is deemed a commodity too. It doesn't mean the government has jurisdiction over its elements (in other words the properties of gold are not within a national legal framework). States are of course free to decide that gold is legal tender but that bears no consequence to gold's alegality.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-08 23:57:16 UTC | #165

You can say Bitcoin and Ethereum are not alegal in the sense they have their own native legal (consensus) systems but that would be bending the meaning of alegal which is commonly understood to refer to nation state rules.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-09 00:05:28 UTC | #166

Yeah, I've been using Dapp interchangeably with canister more or less. You're right. 

The NNS can still vote to take these down though, no?

-------------------------

cnr | 2021-12-09 00:11:07 UTC | #167

Uh... so what are we going to do? 

When a future ICP game developer spends thousands of hours on creating a great game and then someone else duplicates their code and starts giving it away for free we're just going to say, "too bad, canisters are unstoppable, you don't get any rights to your creative output." 

Property rights, copyrights, and intellectual property have a place, at least until we can find a better mechanism. 

I'm hopeful, for example, that there are alternative mechanisms to enable patents and copyrights in an era of crypto. But that doesn't mean that we can just ignore their importance in the meantime.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-09 00:32:26 UTC | #168

You're facts aren't wrong, but your interpretation of them is. For example, The TPPA was under negotiation for 5 years primarily because of American intellectual property enforcement requirements. The fact Trump canned was just what put it to bed. It's the US putting intellectual property enforcement into trade deals that has created that green map.

I could analyse your critique of my other points but I need to go to bed. 

I am out here flying around, canvassing the community, speaking to people directly, regularly running online surveys to understand sentiment.  I'm not paid to do it, I just do it so I can provide the best support and guidance to this community possible. I'm not an ideologue - but I am a salesperson and this is really hard to sell.

talkingant | 2021-12-09 01:18:19 UTC | #173

You can say blockchains are alegal all you want, but it won't matter of our node operators end up in jail. Listen, I'm all for code is law, DAOs, etc. But we have to face the reality of the situation which is there is credible legal risk to node operators. Until there is much more popular support for crypto, that will be the case. And what good is it if we just end up turning the IC into a niche child porn hosting service that lives in the fringes of society? Anarchy/non-governance is not the way forward.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2021-12-09 01:59:13 UTC | #174

This is two side of a coin. To me, It looks like an opportunity for ICP here. Just imagine if IP owner feel safer that their copywright is more protected on ICP Web3 rather than legacy Web2. This open opportunity for future adoption from big corporations. It is up to ICP community how to leverage this for the future growth. I want to inspire ICP community / developer to rethink and innovate a way, how to protect IP without touching censorship in ICP. If we can make it possible, it is opening a flood gate of adoption

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 02:38:18 UTC | #175

Chris | 2021-12-09 03:41:57 UTC | #176

An onion router isn't a good idea when there's a central authority to sue... It might be an interesting idea for Badlands?

I think we and to pick our battles and this isn't one of them.

It would be different if it was about censorship or something where there was any legal or moral basis. 

The canister is nothing special-- just a pre-existing browser-based emulator where the file[s] happen to be downloaded to the browser from the Internet Computer. I would prefer Nintendo not walk away with a chunk of our battle chest over this. 

Let's fight over an issue worth fighting over when it presents itself, not a gimmicky canister running a 20 year old game.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-09 04:27:44 UTC | #177

You don't view this as low-stakes "practice" for when the real game is afoot?

And the real game can get very very very nefarious, very quickly.

-------------------------

BHare1985 | 2021-12-09 04:45:05 UTC | #178

If enough people don't think Nintendo has a fair claim, then it shouldn't be removed IMO. If not, where does it stop?

Too many opinions to make a AUP where one size would fit all. Each issue has to be a NNS vote to remove the canister in question.  I think perhaps maybe we could agree on some strict AUP such as no child pornography that wouldn't require a vote, but anything relating to free speech or DMCA is kind of up in the air. Speaking from experience, I've been targetted unfairly with DMCA by a competitor and luckily the DMCA process let me rebuttal and they didn't want to pay legal fees to take it further.

In these scenarios, I agree with lastmjs that we need to protect the node providers. DFINITY must use its available resources to hire attorneys to come up with plausible deniability or whatever it takes to not hold the node providers liable when the NNS agrees to disobey country X's laws. I am not against exposing some amount of risk to node providers if they are located in susceptible jurisdictions (risk vs reward).

I also wouldn't be against node providers rejecting a canister but only if another provider has agreed pick it up. I don't think we should punish these node providers but instead reward the ones who can take on legally complicated content.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-09 05:01:11 UTC | #179

I think the best that could happen is if something like this occurs again, the canister can be suspended until the owner ID's themselves, turn it back on and we throw them to the wolves and let them deal with it. nimby :)

these things really shouldn't be our problem, there's like 190+ countries with all sorts of different rules.  if some content on some node violates some regulation or law frankly I didn't sign up to be part of some political movement here around freedom of whatever.

-------------------------

superduper | 2021-12-09 05:16:04 UTC | #180

however let's take another example from history. As some may know IBM was involved in the census machine market for a very long time. IBM's IP and machines and associated population data contained on punch cards had been used by the Nazis to hunt down and kill millions of Europe's Jews, along with enabling the Nazi war machine in industries in general. 

In the future what if someone were to start using canisters like the Nazi's used IBM's machines?

Perhaps Super Mario is a silly child's game but we all know machines can be used for far worse.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2021-12-09 05:49:12 UTC | #181

It was a piece of luck that the first case involving taking down a canister was so easily resolved. It exposed gaps in Dfinity's prep, divisions within the community, and the need to address both before a more serious threat comes along.
My big takeaway from this discussion is that no real progress towards censorship resistance can happen while we know what information each node holds. As long as node providers and the data centres that host them are exposed, few will risk hosting nodes in places where censorship is stringent, with contraventions of regulations leading to imprisonment. I am thinking of places like South Asia, China, Russia, West Asia, most of Africa outside South Africa, and so on. To lose these will, in turn, undermine the hierarchy of node, data centre, geography and jurisdiction that is at the heart of Dfinity's vision of censorship resistance.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-12-09 07:29:59 UTC | #182

We have collectively put in A LOT OF EXCELLENT IDEAS into this topic. My question is : WHERE IS DFINITY in this discussion? Are they going to be bystanders? Are they going to say "oh we wanted the community to have their say before we opined on this topic?"

It would be, imo, VERY USEFUL to have DFINITY as  PART of this discussion RATHER than a spectator watching "a game".

Currently  , as the situation stands, from the initial post, the following conclusions are fairly obvious from the community, I think:

1. Firstly this topic itself is extremely concerning to the community; because we thought that this was planned to be handled from a. Technical, b. Legal and c. Operational standpoint by DFINITY a long time ago. The various reasons why we think so are documented in multiple posts in this topic. That said, here are the additional points.

2. OPERATIONAL: We have identified that IC should prepare the node providers for how to respond to "take-down" notices. The "take-down" in quotes because it takes many different things into consideration. Dan(@dostro ) is leading the charge here. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-for-guidelines-upon-receipt-of-dmca-notices/9481

3. TECHNICAL: We have identified significant gaps in the current design of IC which leads to several weaknesses on our claims to "designed to be censorship resistant". Jordan(@lastmjs ) is leading the charge here. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/plausible-deniability-for-node-operators/9491

4. LEGAL: I believe that both operational and technical aspects will require significant help from legal side to make IC most censorship resistant. Further i believe,  based on some of the posts here, that DFINITY would be able provide this help based on their prior work.

5. The proposal of AUP IS ON HOLD as far as I can see because there is no broad consensus on how an AUP can be formulated or whether it should be formulated at all.

6. Censorship cannot be just plonked on the community and say just vote on it; where the proposed abstains from even voting. There has to a commonly agreed-to vision (even if we are not there yet) and a roadmap to getting to the vision. Then, to satisfy the short-term needs, sure, we might need to take down a canister or two. BUT only in context of a larger picture (the vision) as we begin to make the platform stronger in face of opposition. 

7. This point is just a comment. Obviously this is extremely taxing for everyone who is passionately involved; both from a time as well as emotions. 

I believe that IC represents the BEST opportunity to unshackle us from the tyranny of big-tech. However I also think that this topic is the existential threat to the vision of IC.

REST ASSURED: corporations and , through political donations ("free speech"),  governments will FIGHT IC tooth and nail.

> Hell a corporation qualifies as community ownership. These things exist everywhere (eg AWS) now so I don’t know what you’re talking about. You don’t need The IC for community ownership.

Do you really see no difference? How much influence — do you think — did `APPL` share holders have on Apple's decision to remove Navalny's App from the Russian app store?

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 08:45:08 UTC | #184

The point you and seemingly almost everyone sees to miss is if the NNS starts "picking battles" it'll be seen as a powerful entity making governance decisions outside of democratic control, thus undermining state authority. It *will* be brought to heal. 

If the NNS stays out of the moderation game, states will only go after individual users using other tools such as blockchain analysis like they do with other blockchains and decentralised systems such as TOR. 

Remember Silk Road? Did the government try to ban Bitcoin or TOR? No they did not. They went after Ross Ulbricht and used various investigatory tools available to them *above* the protocol level. They did this because they saw the protocols as autonomous. If the IC is actively governed like Facebook is, they'll go after it as opposed to individual users. 

Learn from history people!

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 08:46:23 UTC | #185

Not a lot but if the NNS goes down a moderation road, the sheer volume of cases it would have to handle will require delegation to management and ICP holders will then be little different to Apple shareholders.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 08:48:03 UTC | #186

It absolutely is. The intellectual property becomes a public rather than private good but its creator is still rewarded. It's a *much* better system.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 08:50:50 UTC | #187

That's exactly what people said about Bitcoin in 2012.

-------------------------

christian | 2021-12-09 09:22:11 UTC | #188

But you don't make any discount on the fact that we're just in the beginning and  the current governance system is in its infancy. We have so many tools at our disposal like the built-in value exchange infrastructure (ICP, cycles) to create economic incentives for IC users and in combination with smart contracts to automate and auto-regulate a whole lot of processes  (e.g. at least to prevent trivial IP infringements). I don't think that questioning the entire idea of DAOs at the first obstacle is productive. I would hope, that the early adopters of IC would embrace this challenge "not because it's easy, but **because it's hard**".

-------------------------

coin_master | 2021-12-09 09:24:13 UTC | #189

I am more leaning towards what @Ciaran proposing, the IC is an infrastructure like the web, it shouldn’t interfere with the politics and what is being hosted on, if an entity has an issue with what is hosted on a canister they can go after the individual to take it down.
We should instead think about how to protect the node providers and how to more decentralize the network so that there's no one point that can be attacked, just like the good old WEB.

-------------------------

Tbd | 2021-12-09 09:58:53 UTC | #190

Keep seeing the worst examples being brought up: "Mass shootings, slave markets, bla bla"
All those things are already enabled by the internet ffs. At some point a blockchain with equal capabilities to the IC will be spun up, and your votes wont be able to do shit about it. Lets not pretend we exist in a vacuum. Ethereum is far more dangerous with DeFi today and I can put super mario on filecoin easily.

Perhaps, but in a democratic society, that is not for you to decide, but for elected lawmakers. Once somebody considers themselves above the law and above democratic decision making, it's just totalitarian hubris.

Not all societies are sufficiently democratic, I get it. In fact, few are. But mine fortunately is. How do we resolve this tension without giving democracy, rule of law, and all the people it represents a kick in the face?

What? I'm saying that a new game creator would choose to be rewarded by quadratic funding rather than via IP rights. That is a contractual choice and doesn't in any way undermine the laws in any democracy.

I'm going to take leave of this thread now but safe to say my mind is blown re the lack of understanding of why decentralised protocols succeed and I have little hope for the success of this project if it pursues a policy of active governance of the ledger (as opposed to just the protocol rules). 

If people want to live in some fantasy land where they are seen to use governance to remove copyright infringements, hate speech, child porn, etc, yet simultaneously believe The IC won't have to delegate authority to some entity to perform these tasks, and that this entity, which would unambigiously be a fiduciary, won't have to register as a money transmitter or brokerage in every jurisdiction on the planet, then so be it. 

The reality is that *will* happen. The IC will be centrally administered. Every account on the IC will be KYC'd. ICP will be deemed a security in common law jurisdictions (because it blatantly would be). Governments will routinely interact with this entity to pursue public policy goals. 

Perhaps at that point the penny will drop that absolutely nothing new has been created here.

The context was that you suggested that the IC should ignore IP legislation, which was created by democratic processes. The game creator might not prefer what you prefer and rather continue to operate in this framework of IP laws.

(For the record, I'm not even a big fan of current IP laws, but I respect the process that created them.)

For some here, the point of the IC is to liberate us from the stranglehold and caprice of big tech monopolies, not to circumvent laws in functioning societies.

No if you read back the context was suggesting a better mechanism than IP. 

If you don't think an actively governed IC (by ICP holder financial interests) wouldn't be a big tech monopoly then I don't know what to say to you. 

OK I'm really done with this thread now. Good luck reinveting web 2.0.

Suggesting is fine, but the rub is in who get's to _decide_ what's better.

That would presume that the IC is a democracy. But it is missing most constituting principles of a proper democracy. In its current form, it's a business oligarchy at best.

This 2017 Medium article by @dominicwilliams explains the thinking behind the NNS (then BNS).

Dominic's thoughts on matter may have evolved (a little bit) since then, but it is still a good read!

Just shows how scared folks are of the IC, don't think so? How long was Mario up? two weeks? Looks like we are getting more attention than most of us tend to realize.

While it is important to have this discussion, as some have pointed out, nuance is missing in many cases.
Imho things getting mixed up too much. IP protection should not be confused with censorship per se. 

Censoring free speech has nothing to do with opposition to stealing someone's work. I'm actually really happy this happend and the discussion that it caused. For me this project is not at a stage where it has the ability to be 'unstoppable' and will take a few years and a few thousand nodes more before it will reach the point where it would be really hard to shut anything down without the community (NNS/governance panel elected through people parties or whatever it might be) agreeing.

While passion seems to be strong and it is important to keep the ultimate goal in focus we should recognize the importance to grow to a much bigger and stronger beast before starting to battle the powers to be. For me the fact that a node operator get's mail from Nintendo just shows how much the whole industry is watching us, and how many people have an interest in the IC not to succeed.

You don't send infants into battle.

Sure I get the point of jurisdiction and all the different things that might be considered illegal in one place might be seen as perfectly fine in others, but looking at the reality right now there are nodes in the EU, US and Singapore, so while important to talk about the what if scenarios, we should keep reality in mind and start worrying about the CCP once there are a couple of hundred nodes in China that get threatened to be taken down for whatever reason. We are by far not there yet.

Since this is a developer forum I would have thought IP protection should be in everyone's best interest,
feel free to donate, but have the right to own your work (btw I'm not a dev, but like to get paid for my work and expect to have my patented inventions protected)

just my 2 cents

Maybe the problem is that the IC *at the moment* makes it possible for Nintendo to pursue node operators. You seem to be confusing the ability of the IC to challenge an ownership paradigm it [supposedly] deems outdated and the resistence that the dying paradigm will put up, with the IC becoming the wild west. A-legality as it was used by @Ciaran is not about the law not caring about the IC/BTC (it clearly does care, a lot), it's about the IC/BTC operating independently of it to the extent that it can precisely challenge obsolete paradigms. If you think the transition will be without friction I don't know what to tell you.
