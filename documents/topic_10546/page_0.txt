I have an existing canister on mainnet that was deployed with 0.8.4. I want to use the new heartbeat functionality with motoko in 0.9.0. If I try to upgrade my canister on the ic with dfx 0.9.0, I get error:
```
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 403 Forbidden, content type "", content: Requested canister rejected the message
```
How do I upgrade my canister code with dfx 0.9.0 (I obviously cannot reinstall my code and lose state)?

Might be related to https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-generate-failing-in-0-9-0/10470, not sure...

Running into the same problem.

UPD: figured it out - since `--no-wallet` behavior is now the default one, you have to specify a wallet to deploy from.
```
dfx deploy --network ic --wallet <wallet-canister-id> 
```

That seems like a problem almost every IC dev will run into. Hope they can document that somewhere...

We will document that in the release notes - it's not related to `dfx generate`, just the wallet changes.

We haven't published those changes to smartcontracts.org yet, since there hasn't been an official, blessed build of 0.9.x, but it is documented in the sdk [changelog](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc#feat-remove-the-wallet-proxy-and-the---no-wallet-flag)

I note that https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html shows dfx version 0.9.0 but the "dfx deploy" does not use the --wallet flag.

You'll have to upgrade your wallet canister and run a command to upgrade your other canisters in order to use dfx 0.9.0.  This is documented in the [changelog](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc#feat-remove-the-wallet-proxy-and-the---no-wallet-flag) and in the [release notes](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/release-notes/0.9.0-rn.html).  After running the steps to upgrade, you should not need the `--wallet` parameter.

Unfortunately we've published the dfx 0.9.0 release notes, as well as updated the docs to use dfx 0.9.0, but have not yet promoted dfx 0.9.0.


> 
> Breaking change: Canister commands, except for `dfx canister create`, will make the call directly, rather than via the user's wallet. The `--no-wallet` flag is thus removed from `dfx canister` as its behavior is the default.
> 
> When working with existing canisters, use the `--wallet` flag in conjunction with `dfx identity get-wallet` in order to restore the old behavior.

> You will need to upgrade your wallet and each of your existing canisters to work with the new system.  To do so, execute the following in each of your dfx projects:

```
dfx wallet upgrade
dfx canister --wallet "$(dfx identity get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
```

> To upgrade projects that you have deployed to the IC mainnet, execute the following:


```
dfx wallet --network ic upgrade
dfx canister --network ic --wallet "$(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
```

Yes, you can ignore this warning.  It's described in the release notes:

https://smartcontracts.org/docs/release-notes/0.9.0-rn.html#_repeated_warning_about_missing_max_block_payload_size_registry_setting

Thanks for the reply.

I have tried to upgrade the wallet but I keep getting this error.

`dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

`The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 403 Forbidden, content type "", content: Requested canister rejected the message`

```
dfx -V
dfx 0.9.0
```

And I made sure my principal is the controller of the wallet.

Not sure if this has something to do with it but my deployed production wallet has more than one controller.

Omg I was stuck on this for like 3 hours. Thanks for this!

I have exactly the same error. When I create cans in the operation and fill the data (Blob) into them. The local environment freezes and even restarting dfx does not help. We have to build new canisters of services.Something like that...
