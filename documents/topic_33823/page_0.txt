Hi to everyone. I'm developing an API to consume [ledger](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mc6ru-gyaaa-aaaar-qaaaq-cai) and [minter](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai) canisters.
after days of reading to get their candidacies, generate the idl and connect, I managed to create the connections and generate bitcoin address, and send me from the testnet an amount of btc to an account.

My problem now is with the transfers. I understand that the ledger has 2 transfer methods, transfer and transferFrom. But both for the recipient expect to receive account and subaccount, as well as the id of the sending account.

How can I know this data for a destination account? Is it not possible to do it with an address? Or is it with the address and I misunderstood? 

I would be grateful to anyone who can help me with this, it has been very hard weeks trying to implement this with no technical support in the company. Thank you.
