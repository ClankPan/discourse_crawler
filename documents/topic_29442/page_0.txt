I just upgraded my dfx from 0.15.2-beta to 0.19.0 (motoko: v0.11.0) and the dfx nns install threw the following:

I switched the dfx version to 0.18.0 and dfx nns install is now working

It looks to me as if the really interesting bit - why the xdr rate is not set - is probably higher up.  But as long as this is reproducible it should be fixable. :smiley:  It looks as if maybe @Andre-Popovitch could help? (judging by commits [here](https://github.com/dfinity/dfx-extensions/tree/main/extensions/nns))

Hi, could you share the exact commands that cause you to run into this output? I wasn't able to reproduce the issue myself:

```

❯ dfx extension install nns --version 0.4.0                          
  Version v0.19.0 installed successfully.
  Extension 'nns' installed successfully

I just realized that you were talking about `dfx nns install`, not installing `dfx nns` :D However I am still not able to reproduce the issue (https://gist.github.com/anchpop/3f0b533690672d66d2091d91c4657867)

Hi
Sorry for the late reply.
Here is the full log. Previously I stop the command prematurely due to seeing it `Panicked at...` such as screenshot below. 
![image|690x469](upload://5awYIyYNHtwsYHVQJ0cdRtdZQHg.png)

But now I just let it run and it says `NNS CANISTER INSTALLATION COMPLETE`.

Perhaps I'm wrong. If so, sorry for the false alarm.

Nice, glad it seems to have worked the second time :D
