This thread intends to serve as a follow up regarding the Periodic Followee Confirmation, originally brought up by @wpb , which can be found below


https://forum.dfinity.org/t/periodic-confirmation-of-neuron-followees/12109


After engaging in extensive deliberation and dialogue on the matter, it became evident that there is a shared recognition of the necessity of periodic followee confirmation to safeguard the long-term decentralization of the network. By implementing periodic followee confirmation, we can establish a system that promotes consistent and reliable voting behavior and standards. Named Neurons, in particular, are required to ensure that the individuals who have assigned their voting power to them are content and satisfied, should they desire to have their voting power reassigned. This ensures a fair and accountable process for all participants.

Given this, the initial periodic confirmation of neuron followees proposal was created, which can be found below


https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651


This proposal received an acceptance rate of 30.012%, taking into account that Cycle DAO abstained and IC Devs voted no. It is noteworthy that both DFINITY and a significant portion of the community expressed their support for the proposal, which was interpreted as a positive indication of acceptance and commitment.

It is important to acknowledge that developing reliable code takes time and cannot be accomplished overnight. Understanding this, the community has shown patience toward the DFINITY Foundation regarding the immediate implementation of the complete functionality. Instead, the community suggested an immediate followee reset as a step towards addressing the concerns at hand. The details of this proposal can be found below.


https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56622


In contrast to the previous proposal, this one did not succeed, receiving a rejection rate of 41.183%. The notable distinction between the two proposals lies in the fact that the previous one had the support of both DFINITY and ICA, whereas in this case, they opted to vote against it.

Regrettably, I was unable to find any extensive discussions about this specific decision on the forums, and I believe it would be counterproductive to include potentially off-topic Twitter conversations in this context. However, if anyone possesses additional information shedding light on the rationale behind this decision, I would greatly appreciate learning more about it.

Again, the community decided to practice patient with the DFINITY Foundation, and waited for the followee reset. However, it was never brought up again, until @justmythoughts created the following topic


https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-prioritize-55651-periodic-confirmation-38985-manual-voting-over-48623-compounding-maturity/14461


Essentially, the topic at hand emphasizes the importance of prioritizing network decentralization over short-term tax optimization. A constructive debate ensued, with active participation from various members of the DFINITY team. As the discussions progressed, a general consensus emerged among team members, leading them to vote against the proposal. Their reasoning centered around the belief that the NNS should not be employed as a mechanism to signal off-chain actions.

During this discussion, a new proposal was introduced, which stands out as the closest outcome we have witnessed thus far within this thread. The referenced proposal can be found here 


https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/72189


However, the recent proposal yielded a rejection rate of 31.815%, with only 17.347% in favor. This outcome signifies that while the community had the opportunity to voice their concerns, the decision to initiate followee resets and decentralize the network still rested solely with DFINITY.

It is important to note that the events discussed thus far took place between April and July of 2022, nearly one year ago.

I have raised this concern multiple times, primarily through Twitter and also within the forums. However, these attempts have either been dismissed or met with promises of imminent action, only to result in no tangible progress.


![IMG_8943|690x431](upload://sZFkVfQO0dQuQLNfzoxxqB43685.jpeg)


I want to make it clear that I do not intend to be excessively critical, as I understand that the DFINITY team is concurrently working on multiple features and implementations. 

Nonetheless, in light of the considerable patience displayed by the community regarding this topic, I believe it is reasonable to seek an update from the DFINITY Foundation on the progress of this implementation and the prospects for near-term network decentralization.

I still support proposal 55651 (periodic confirmation of neuron Followees) as it was written because of the advances to decentralization and the minimum definition of active participation in governance that it attempted to suggest.  However, the drivers for it are not as strong as they were at the time (spam was solved in other ways) and it was recognized by many people after the proposal was completed that it would leave us exposed to security risks that DFINITY would no longer be able to resolve quickly (since critical updates would not pass by absolute majority).  I look forward to the day periodic confirmation gets implemented, but I also agree with the position that the community should not try to force DFINITY to do something that the community should be able to do itself.  That was a learning for me after proposal 72189 (proposal to prioritize periodic confirmation and manual voting over compounding maturity) failed and was the primary driver why I started to believe that it was time for the community to step up and make these kinds of code contributions to the IC.  However, that requires funding.  I thought it made sense for the NNS to control a treasury to fund development of protocol level code and critical infrastructure that is important to the IC community, but certain members of the community were not too keen on the idea.  Hence, I guess we are back to just complaining when DFINITY doesn't do what the community wants.  We'll see how far that gets us this time around, but I don't plan to get as heavily involved in these types of discussions moving forward.

Proposal 56622 (instantly reset followers for all topic categories) was submitted to the NNS without any discussion or warning to the community.  It was submitted by @ysyms not long after he stopped his spam efforts.  He has always been vocal about his opposition to any requirement for community discussion about a proposal before it is submitted to the NNS.  That's why you can't find anything about it on the forum.  I personally do not support that proposal because it called for the immediate reset of Followees.  In my opinion, a reset of Followees should only occur after giving voters fair warning about new participation requirements and enabling voters to take action that would inhibit the automatic reset of their own neurons.

I suspect your goal in resurfacing this topic is to put heat on DFINITY to reset neuron Followees because you believe that the [Synapse.vote](www.synapse.vote) neuron triggers too much voting power when we vote and a lot of SNS proposals are forthcoming.  If that's the case, then it might be interesting to see what happens over the next several months after we submit a proposal next week to create a new Synapse named neuron and we recommend to our followers that they switch to the new neuron.  If they switch, then it will be confirmation that people who have chosen to follow Synapse continue to do so intentionally.  Interestingly, even though Synapse took a lot of heat during the treasury discussion, the total amount of voting power that we trigger when we vote actually went up, not down.  I would argue that everyone who is a voting member for Synapse believes strongly in decentralization and none of us are trying to hang on to a large percentage of voting power, but people are free to follow us at their own discretion and we have no control over it.  

I think there is also a misconception that a lot of voting power follows DFINITY on the Governance proposal topic.  The reality is that when neurons 27 and 28 vote they trigger only a couple percentage of total voting power more than the voting power that is directly owned by DFINITY and ICA.  This is evident by looking at the largest voting power jump in any Governance proposal and comparing that number to the the amount reported on the dashboard.  I mention that because a Followee reset is not going to change the amount of voting power that is cast when DFINITY votes on Governance proposals.

From my perspective, Followee reset was not about redistribution of voting power.  It was about enabling the tokenomics to incentivize active participation in governance.  I see default following as an inhibition to active participation in governance.  I want to see an increase in total voter participation on the Governance topic and I want to see better than a binary vote participation on other proposal topics such as Replica Version Management.  Anything that can be done to achieve that kind of decentralization is a positive movement in my opinion.

Anyway, I hope this provides some context you were asking for in your OP and I wish you luck moving the needle on this Followee reset topic this time around.  I'm supportive, but perhaps for different reasons.

jwarner | 2023-05-28 05:55:23 UTC | #3

Hey @Accumulating.icp, if I'm understanding correctly, what you would like to do is reset every neuron so it doesn't follow any other neuron, and make the people select who they want to follow again? That way, voting is current and handled by people who are still active in the community?

Is that correct?

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-05-28 09:01:33 UTC | #4

As I understand it, DFINITY will surrender their voting power in the future as part of their roadmap.

The issue I have:

I go to bed after checking the Proposal Dashboard with no Open proposal that I have not voted on to find when I get up in the morning many Executed proposals while I was asleep. How can I participate in active voting in this situation?

I believe that DFINITY decisions, for me, has been in the interest of the project and all Stakers.

Some of the proposals I have seen I would consider stigmatized in their ideals as I do with the issues raised with the Following list or as it was called in the past, dead people. 

When I voted for dead people and for the Followers List I was thinking of us as a group but those who want to use excuses to take others votes and rewards sound like centralisation and corruption.

Don’t worry I will make sure that I periodically check and have been checking my list of followers every month.

While I understand your perspective, I want to emphasize the importance of decentralization in our network. While it may not be a driving factor for you personally, many in the community believe that achieving decentralization is crucial. Considering the initial allocation of voting power by the foundation, it is reasonable to expect them to take responsibility for the process of decentralization. Even some DFINITY employees have acknowledged this responsibility and expressed the need to prioritize it.

I’d rather not get into the nuance of your treasury again - but we all know what the issue there was. There’s a problem when you want to start forcibly taking rewards from people (that they stake for insane lockup periods to achieve), to pay yourself.

However, I'm curious how you expect a notification to be delivered to neurons? The forum had been utilized extensively for discussion regarding the topic - so that is debatably a notification. Twitter certainly was vocal about it at the time - so that is debatably a notification.

Are you expecting a notification within the NNS UI (which we’re saying people utilize as set&forget to begin with, meaning they wouldn’t truly receive the notification) disclaiming that a followee reset had been discussed for weeks, had passed via NNS (which they’d know if they are opening the NNS for your notifications), and will now be enacted (after a proposal has already passed for it)?

I'm not saying there shouldn't be some form of "timer" within the NNS frontend dApp, but in that instance, it was discussed thoroughly throughout the ecosystem. I don't think its intellectually honest to say that proposal 56622 had to be rejected because people weren't aware of the discussion.

[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20290"]

[/quote]

I’d also like to take a moment to remind you, you are not the center of the world Wenzel. 

This topic was not inspired by Synapse, or quite frankly, any other named neurons, aside from the DFINITY Foundations - which triggers 98%+ voting power in topics aside from "Governance" and "SNS & CF". 

Based off our private conversations, I know you don't find this to be an issue, due to the "competence" of voting parties, however I'd like to stress the long term risk of the foundation withholding 98% control indefinitely. I'm not saying that followees should be outright removed, or that DFINITY should not be reassigned the voting power. I'm saying that people should have to periodically reaffirm, "yes, I am comfortable with DFINITY utilizing my voting power still". 

The foundation for decentralization needs to be layed, even if it is something that has to be achieved gradually over time.

[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20290"]
I think there is also a misconception that a lot of voting power follows DFINITY on the Governance proposal topic.
[/quote]

I am very well aware of the difference between voting power DFINITY owns, and what is assigned to them. I am also very well aware that the governance topic was removed of default followees, and therefor not automatically assigned to DFINITY - resulting in them receiving a much smaller VP allocation. This has resulted in the majority of their governance VP being their own. 

However, this isn’t about the governance topic. 

This is about the fact that DFINITY controls 98%+ of the voting power, on all other topics. 

The ones that actually matter. That effect change.

[quote="wpb, post:2, topic:20290"]

[/quote]

While you personally have a different agenda regarding the followee reset, I don’t think it’s intellectually honest to say it does not serve the decentralization of the network. It would be forcing people to reassign their voting power manually, for the first time outside of new topics - which inherently translates to gradual decentralization from the current 98%+ control.

I think we can all agree we want to increase voter participation, and in turn the decentralization of the network. I'm simply asking for an update on the progress, of something that will contribute to this. I appreciate the response & clarity regarding ysyms proposals.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-28 15:42:40 UTC | #6

Goodmorning @jwarner 

In essence, yes, I'd like to see the foundation follow through on the reset of neuron followees, having them periodically re-confirm who they've assigned their voting power too. 

This establishes two things;

Primarily, it begins decentralize the 98% network control DFINITY assigned themselves, by making themselves the default followee for neurons. 

*Evidenced here, because I feel as though I'm going to get some "that didn't happen"s*
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485

Secondarily, it instills a sense of responsibility for the voting power held by named neurons; knowing if they don’t perform satisfactory, the voting power will be reassigned elsewhere.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-28 15:44:57 UTC | #7

I feel as though there might be a language barrier here, so I apologize in advance if I’ve misinterpreted your message.

However I’d like to emphasize that this proposal does not aim to remove people’s rewards (while it may be an unintended consequence, if users are not reassigning their VP, or actively voting).

The point of this is to accelerate the decentralization we see on the network level. DFINITY has stated *eventually* they will turn over their voting power.

Which is fair, however, it’s been a year+ since this proposal has passed - with no progress made, other than promises. 

I don’t think we should have to wait indefinitely for DFINITY to decide they’re ready to decentralize the network. 

Which is why I’m simply asking where we’re at on this.

-------------------------

jwarner | 2023-05-28 16:05:08 UTC | #8

I'm confused, because when I created my neurons, there was no default following. They were all blank and I had to manually go in and select who to follow for all 13 options. So section "a" from that proposal was implemented, at least for me when I created a neuron a couple weeks ago. I don't know how to check voting weight to see if section "b" was implemented.

Also, the proposal said " As a final note, if this proposal is adopted, the NNS dapp user interface will be updated to say *All Topics Except Governance* instead of *All Topics*.  In my interface there is no "All Topics", it says "All Except Governance, and SNS & Community Fund". So it looks like they followed through on that part as well? Unless I'm missing something, or they didn't implement section "b", this proposal was voted through and completed? I have all these question marks because I'm still new when it comes to looking at the information.

If that proposal passed and was implemented, you're working towards getting just the reset implemented now?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-05-28 16:57:44 UTC | #9

The proposal I cited was the one in which they resolved the default followee for the governance topic - however it references how all neuron followees were assigned to DFINITY by default at genesis. (This proposal was passed in 2021)

Meaning if you’re a newer neuron, you didn’t even notice the default followee. However the neurons from genesis, which are the grand majority (we’ve been at ~50% ICP staked since genesis), received a default followee, and in most cases, left it to ensure rewards, under the “set and forget” mindset. 

That proposal is completely unrelated to the Followee Reset, and was just used as a reference, to showcase how they obtained 98% voting power. 

The original post details other proposals, passed in 2022, which, yes, although passed via NNS, have not been implemented to this day.

Which is why I’m trying to understand where the progress is at on this, as DFINITY has acceptable responsibility regarding the matter.

[/quote]

All neurons created at genesis and for the first 14 months after genesis were set to follow neurons 27 or 28 on "All Topics", which is the catch all category that covers all other topics where someone does not intentionally choose a Followee and formerly included the Governance topic.  This topic has transitioned twice and now includes "All Topic Except Governance and SNS & Community Fund" as you observed. Since no neurons had a default following on the Governance topic at genesis and since SNS & Community Fund did not exist until more recently, one can reasonably assume that the total voting power that is actively participating in governance is equal to the total voting power that is cast on these proposal topics, which is currently close to 54%.  Yet 99.4% of total voting power is cast when neurons 27 and 28 vote on any topic other than Governance and SNS & Community Fund.  If a Followee reset were to occur, then it is likely that the total voting power that would be cast on these other proposals topics (e.g. subnet updates, Replica Version Management, etc) would be around 30% in the beginning and quickly move up to match the voting rate for the Governance topic.  However, DFINITY would not have the ability to immediately trigger Absolute Majority with their vote and execute critical updates.  It would take up to 4 days to execute all proposals.  Typically we don't achieve Absolute Majority on Governance proposals until day 3 or 4, so it would be reasonable to expect the same if periodic confirmation of neuron Followees were implemented.  Since we do see 99.4% voting power cast and these proposals execute immediately, it is reasonable to assume that periodic confirmation of neuron Followees has not been implemented. Plus I'm sure that DFINITY would have posted it on the forum if it had been implemented since it has always been a topic important to the community for a variety of reasons.  In regards to proposal 34485, both parts a and b were implemented in Feb 2022.  Part a removed Governance from All Topics.  Part b resulted in a lot of spam in the NNS, but it was later reversed to mitigate the spam problem.  The voting reward weights still exist in the code.  Does that explanation help?

kvic | 2023-05-28 17:50:31 UTC | #12

No language barrier here, I have made my case on the subject and it wasn’t personal against you and your right to have your say. 

DFINITY has the final say on the subject and I am happy to accept their decision and timeline as I feel they have a responsibility for the decisions made on this project.

Too often I am seeing other projects having problems from bad actors who believe they are right and are now causing project and legal problems, which is not democratic or practicing decentralized decisions but more about their beliefs and needs. 

We have the right to offer our opinion and accept the outcome.

Under DFINITY we have not suffered any of the problems of other projects and they have my full support.

I also believe the majority of neuron owners on this project have the best interest of this project and if DFINITY makes a decision that is not popular they will feel the opposition and as they have in the past made changes in my opinion from the backlash they often seem to receive as do I from others in this forum from my opinions.

I see a change in the practice of how we should discuss proposals on this forum by the frequent use of the term, twitter, as a place for discussion. I do not support the use of twitter, I do not use twitter.

Currently I am seeing many Governments legislate against twitter and in my opinion provides a place for bad actors to provide misinformation.

This is where I want to see discussions about his project and I have liked you in other subjects and see you as a valued neuron owner with good intentions.

Again, the topic is still available for people to do their own research, this isn't a "smear tactic", but instead, an easily verifiable fact. 

The following topic lays out how there is only one named neuron, and that this is likely because it is not an incentivized task. The topic then goes on to explain why it should be one of many incentivized tasks via the NNS, and details how to either generate a stream of rewards, by either taking them from people, or minting new ones.

I see, thanks for taking the time to help me understand. Proposal 55651 passed showing voters like the idea of a followee reset, but proposal 56622 shows they didn't want it done immediately, and 72189 shows it's not really a priority to voters.

Kudos to you for trying to push the network towards decentralization and keep the voters active. Unfortunately, in my personal experience working in a large organization, you're fighting an uphill battle while trying to heard cats. Ha ha!

****TLDR:** Put a bounty on it and pay for a proposal that has the code written and will be implemented without have to wait for Dfinity? Is there a way to make it NOT feel like they're making big changes and rugging rewards from people who staked from genesis with the understanding they could follow and forget? (My suggestion below.)**

In my experience, a lot of people think change is a good thing and they love new ideas. But when it comes to implementation of those changes, no one has time to put in the work, really WANTS to put in the work, or wants to take responsibility for what might happen when those changes are implemented. Looking at it from the point of view of Dfinity, it's a good idea that people like, but it's not a priority.

With that being said, with the NNS set up the way it is. Is it possible to put up a bounty for someone to write the code to implement this without Dfinity? That way you and the voters who want this can avoid waiting around for an answer and just get it done?

This sounds to me like a pretty significant change to how the protocol operates and deviates quite a bit from the expectations of people who staked from the beginning. I fully understand that if these things were important to people, they should be paying attention and participating, but in my experience, that is rarely the case.

I believe a lot of people want to set their neurons to follow whoever and forget about it (essentially yield farming). And there shouldn't be anything wrong with that because that's how the initial system was designed. Also, in this bear market, since there is no way to exit a staked neuron until it is dissolved, some people have resigned themselves to the fact their funds are locked and at least take comfort in the belief they'll still earn voting rewards because they followed neurons.

With that said, my concern would be people would come back from a hiatus from the ecosystem and wonder wtf happened to their voting rewards? "When I signed up, it said XYZ, then you changed it without informing me personally." Should they being paying attention? Yes. DO they always pay attention? No. 

Since the system is changing, they'll want out of the ecosystem altogether. But since they locked the neuron for a few years based on their belief in follow and forget, they can't. And now you're in the realm of FORCING them to participate every 6 months to earn the rewards, when they didn't have to do that before. Everything I've ever read says making people spend time/lose out on something that was previously free/easily attainable is a terrible idea.

Also, six months seems short to me. Again, just an opinion. Living in the U.S. my entire life, I don't think any major political decisions are made/confirmed every six months. Hell, I only get a chance to pick the leader of our country every 4 years. ICP has only been alive for 2. Ha ha!

Hopefully you can get some sort of update on the status. I'd be interested to know as well.

I see, thanks for taking the time to help me understand. Proposal 55651 passed showing voters like the idea of a followee reset, but proposal 56622 shows they didn’t want it done immediately, and 72189 shows it’s not really a priority to voters.

I'd agree with this if it was actually the community voting, but when named neurons who are assigned followees by default are doing the voting - I don't think that's an accurate reflection of community sentiment.

[/quote]

This is actually the ironic part of it all. Upon genesis, this model wasn't employed - you didn't have to vote to receive rewards, you simply received rewards for staking. The voting power was automatically assigned to ensure DFINITY could pass what they needed (because 30% isn't enough). Participants within this thread went out of their way to remove rewards from people who didn't vote, and only assign them to those who do vote. 

So while I sympathize with the "rugging" sentiment - that part has already been done and clearly isn't a concern to those involved.

You would be surprised with the amount of governance discussion that happens in 6 months, let alone two years.

This needs to be clarified.  There are no named neurons that are voting on Governance proposals with voting power that was assigned to them by default.  All voting power that is cast on all Governance proposals including 55651, 56622, and 72189 is voting because of actions taken by the neuron owners to either vote manually or to select a Followee on the Governance proposal topic.

I don't think anyone from DFINITY has engaged in this thread yet.  Proposal 34485 was created and implemented by DFINITY because the concept of decentralization of governance motion proposals was untenable due to default following and inclusion of the Governance topic in the All Topics catch all category.  That proposal resulted in the decentralization that we see today, which is vastly improved compared to what existed at genesis.  ICPMN (now synapse), cycle_dao (now Arthur's), and ICDevs had all put themselves forward as options as Followees for the Governance topic since the time proposal 34485 was implemented because we all believe in the decentralization of the IC.  However, we did not set that change in place.  We were all aware that the change was going to occur because it was discussed on the forum for several weeks before it was submitted to the NNS as a motion proposal.  Then it took another 2-4 months before it was implemented and took effect.  In the meantime, the concept of the registered known neuron was developed and implemented so there would be options to consider.  The ability to form a registered named neuron has always been open to everyone and all organizations who participate in NNS governance.

This is true & an oversight on my part - thanks for pointing that out. 

Regardless, the foundation still personally owned 20-30% of VP, which represents a grand majority of VP cast within these proposals.

I don't think it is convenient to reset followees every 6 months if one has 1 neuron as a beacon for other neurons assigned to different identity anchors. At the same time, voters should have the right to convenience and decide to whom and for how long they entrust their voting power. In this case, it seems reasonable to give a single deadline of 6 months for each neuron to choose how long they want to observe a given neuron (along with the option of indefinite time of following).
Then anyone who considers a periodic reset to be good for the decentralization would set their following for, for example, a year, and someone who simply wants to permanently entrust their vote to another neuron (for example their favourite foundation) would do it permanently.

Let's get people choose, reset once and that will be real decentralization. Without imposing one right option.

Ahhhh, the infamous "you promised" I see so much.

I think this is a rare, yet fair concern that should be considered. I personally feel as though it is beyond a fair trade off for decentralization, but I can see where the issues come from. 

For instance, my named neuron originally had another ID, however upon merging two together, the ID changed, and the old disappeared. Left an awkward situation in which I had to workout how to configure the non-visible neuron to follow the new one. 

So I can see how it could be annoying having to reconfigure neurons on a 6month basis.

Yes, I was an advocate for it, but that is different than your claim that I removed rewards from people.  I was an advocate because at the time either DFINITY could not vote at all since they would trigger 100% of total voting power or they had to wait until the very end of the voting period and vote according to everyone else that did vote (which amounted to around 3% of total voting power).  This was a handicap for DFINITY and the community in my opinion.  It was a change that was sorely needed and I don't recall there being any dissent on the need for that change at the time.  I also feel like I did my part to get the word out that the change was coming to minimize the impact to as many people as possible.  It was not a sudden change, but the tokenomics incentives that reward active participation in governance did work.  It was amazing how quickly people set up their neuron Following on the Governance topic within a week of the implementation of that change.  People were always promised rewards for voting and anyone who votes has always received those rewards.  The NNS exists because change is necessary and it provides a mechanism for people to make decisions on those changes.  I still don't see the problem with being able to recognize the need to decentralize the Governance topic and then advocating for the community to understand those changes and respond to them accordingly.

[/quote]

The governance landscape being described in 2021-2022 was drastically different than it is now. While neurons may not have been “tricked” into assigning their voting power - if you wanted to receive the entirety of your governance rewards, you HAD to vote on every single proposal. When tens to hundreds of proposals go through a day, this obviously isn’t feasible, when most people have a set & forget mindset. Beyond this, the available list of followees was slim. There was 4 total, by memory, being DFINITY & ICA (the same entity), IC Devs, and ICPMN. 

So it is not an accurate representation to say that everything passed via NNS, is what the community wants. Genesis Governance was extremely centralized, and still is. 

While it’s easy to say that people stake to better the network & participate in governance - let’s be honest, based off the ratio that “set & forget”, most are here for the APY.

As previously stated, the governance landscape within this timeframe was beyond centralized. Were they illegally obtained ? No, of course not. Were they unethically withheld? I think that could be argued, given the promise of decentralization, to never come (2 years is a long time). 

I’m just pointing out the contradiction - on one hand we’re okay with changing terms without people knowing, on the other, it’s okay because the VP has been allocated.

Forcing people to participate would be taking away their staking rewards if they don’t vote on every proposal or assign their VP to another entity. 

I am advocating for the re-affirmation of the assignment of VP. I guess it could be argued that it forcing recurring participation, but I think it could also be argued it simultaneously reinforces decentralization & voter reassurance in their Followee.

I think it sucks when companies/people do it. But it happens all of the time, at least here in the states. Sometimes people are genuine, sometimes not. Hard to say really.

You would be amazed the progress that has been made over the last 2 years. I’m not advocating for immediate removal of VP from DFINITY. I’m advocating for the periodic re-affirmation, that people are comfortable with who their VP has been assigned to. If that results in DFINITY losing VP, that must mean the network has decided it’s ready to entrust its VP to other reputable Named Neurons.

As a governance participant, and advocate for the idea, yes, that would make you partially responsible for the removal of rewards from those who do not vote. Just because you did not personally write the proposal does not absolve the role you play in passing it.

I know you are doing your best to understand and represent information as facts, and I applaud you for it.  However, I find this statement to be egregious.  I am not a whale or a genesis token holder and do not / did not have significant voting power to pass [proposal 34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485).  If you follow the link to the dashboard you will see there were no named neurons that voted on the proposal that implemented that change...they didn't exist at the time.  DFINITY also did not vote on it.  That proposal was passed by unnamed token holders who had every right to vote according to their own convictions.  I played no more role in passing that proposal than yourself, which was to vote with the voting power that I directly owned at the time.  Your claim that I am responsible for removal of rewards from those who do not vote because of proposal 34485 is equivalent to me trying to claim that you are responsible for the compounding maturity [proposal 48623](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) since you are now a named neuron.  I mean, even if you were a named neuron at the time it passed, which you were not, it's ludicrous to claim that you are responsible for that proposal anyway since the entire NNS gets to vote and you do not get to choose who follows your named neuron.

You’re trying to convolute the fact of the matter.

Regardless as to whether you were a named neuron, large token holder, or any other of the criteria you’ve listed; you played a crucial role in the distribution & advocacy of the proposal. 

While you may not like it, it does not absolve the fact that you were partially responsible for the outcome, regardless how large the contribution may be. 

As governance participants, we’re all responsible for the proposals that we’re advocating for, and voting in favour of. It’s dishonest to absolve yourself of that responsibility. 

So yes, I’d agree that every single proposal I’ve voted in favour of, and advocated for - I’ve partially been responsible for.

I find the topic quite controversial. Ideally, people would not have to confirm their choice every moment, and the network would be decentralized.
The question is, what does the word 'decentralization' mean to you? If it is to be a decision of the majority of independent entities, and not a few influential neurons such as ICA or DFINITY, it may be worth expanding the so-called "People Parties" that the foundation is working on, and the Voting Power itself shouldn't have too much to say?

Capital tends to centralize, and no matter what system they put in place, someone influential can still get the majority in some case (if they get huge popularity among the community during the followees reset). Lack of reset may reduce activity, but at the same time increase stability in decision-making.

Stability seems to be a desirable feature in system updates, while popularity in Governance topic. The problem with the "All topics" is the initial setting neuron 28 as default, while the 'Governance' topic should be more engaging and actively managed by the people.

If I had the causative power, I would do the following: immediate (and one-time) reset of followees for neurons that automatically follows neuron 28 since genesis (because it wasn't their personal decision) and introduced a periodic confirmation followees for the topic 'Governance' where the voice of a real human being would be more important and not Voting Power.
For managing in the governing theme, the max. reward would be the same for each personality (basing on activity), while the other topics would remain as they were with Voting Power. Rewards for voters in the 'Governance' topic could be some % of the rewards allocated to neurons voting based on VP, which would encourage many real people from outside the ecosystem to join. There could also be a minimum stake that people would be exposed to, but it wasn't too high and gave everyone the same vote (and the same rewards).

Then capital would run the system and people would have real power over the network and protocol, regardless of the state of their wallets. Thanks to this, they could feel their real impact on the development of the network and support for decentralization, being easily included in it. This would be a compromise at the capitalist-communist level, on which the whole world functions stably on a daily basis.

That’s fair, it’s bound to attract differing opinions. However I don’t think the defining terms of decentralized governance are nearly so simple. We have to reach a point in which people are actively recognizing what they’re doing by assigning their voting power. Furthermore, a point in which people actually choose who they’ve assigned their voting power to.

I don’t believe this adequately justifies indefinitely postponing the decentralization of voting power. While it’s true, yes, capital influences governance, we aren’t even at a point in which that is the case. The majority of the voting power assigned within the “all except” category was done so automatically, and came with the consequence of losing rewards if deviated from, without voting manually on all proposals. Which is obviously overly time consuming with the amount of proposals that go through on a daily basis.

I don’t disagree with this, although I think it opens the door to a more controversial topic - being the creation of new inflation, or outright reduction / redistribution of current neuron rewards.

I believe this is a concept that would be worth playing with ideologically, however I think we have to consider that governance topics aren’t even what enact change.

The governance topic is the only topic that does not result in immediate on-chain events, signalling for off chain action - which the foundation says they’re against, as evidence in the original post. 

Which is why I’m having to make this post in the first place - off-chain action was promised via the governance topic, and was never followed through upon. 


The concept that governance proposals mean something is nice in theory, but this whole thread is showcasing why they don’t.

AFAIK, voting rewards could depend on IC's income in the future (when it becomes profitable). Then, for example, 90% can go to voters on 'All except governance' topics depending on their participation and Voting Power, and 10% of the income can be distributed among all neurons that voted on the 'Governance' topic (which passed the 'proof of humanity' verification process) in the proportion equal for each neuron (in other words, a real person) participating in the Governance process. I think that 10% of net income to support decentralization (and therefore network security) would be quite reasonable. Similar fees occur in the DPOS blockchains for transaction validators, so real people could be "validators of network decentralization" for us.

When cycles are utilized, they are burnt. I’m not aware of any other “income” for ICP as a network, only burn rates. 

Math was done to extrapolate these burn rates, and I believe it was found it’s 3 years before the IC is burning more ICP than it is minting. 

Leaving us in a scenario in which we still have to generate a new stream of rewards, or pay people in cycles from available burn rates. This would come in the form of reduced cost for computation power, or increased cost on the side of developers.

Not saying it can’t or shouldn’t be explored, just that it’s a controversial topic.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-05-29 00:43:34 UTC | #37

In order to reduce inflation, first of all, we need fix the issue of nodes 'Awaiting in Subnet'.
They shouldn't receive rewards for processing, and if they do, certainly not 100% as it is at the moment.
DFINITY should also intensify work on the dynamic rotation of nodes between subnets, which would reduce the chance of unhealthy behavior of nodes. Then one could think about reducing the number of nodes in the subnet, which significantly reduces costs (as illustrated by Plethora Devs Team in them [last Governance proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/121649)).

What is it about the decentralization of voting power that is stupid to you?

I’m not sure if you’re aware, but DFINITY enacts 98%+ of voting power when they cast votes on “all except” topics. 

Not saying they shouldn’t have some degree of control, but an indefinite 98%+ control over code based changes (the only thing that enacts change on the protocol), is not acceptable after 2 years. It inherently strips all decentralization claims.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2023-05-29 23:17:02 UTC | #43

It is not about decentralization at all.
They just assume people to be stupid so that they can teach people to do things.

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-05-30 11:33:49 UTC | #44

It is enough to reset the initial followees of the neuron 27, which was set without the decision of their owners (as the initial settings) and the problem of decentralization and excessive voice power of the ICA (Dominic W.) will be solved without having to reset all settings every few months (which, at some point, could itself create unspecified NNS instability).

While I don’t disagree that you *could* stop at resetting the followees of specifically DFINITY neurons, I don’t think it’d have the negative affect on the network you imply, but rather, a beneficial one.

This feature would ensure that neurons are conscience of who and where they’ve assigned their voting power, with periodic re-affirmations that they’re still confident doing so.

If DFINITY is the best option for people to follow, they will still follow them. This isn’t advocating for the removal of DFINITYs voting power. 

Could you please explain to me how you see this leading to network instability?

If we’re back at the “resources” thing we’ve been hearing for the last year, I will happily write the code myself. The source code for the governance followee reset is available. 

I would just like confirmation that it truly is a resource thing, and not a lack of desire for. 

If a Followee Reset Proposal comes into existence, will the foundation honour the outcome of previous proposals - and vote to pass the code based changes?

Fwiw, I asked @Jan (CTO of DFINITY) and he confirmed what I suspected: 

it's in the NNS team roadmap (the "governance" section [IC Roadmap](https://internetcomputer.org/roadmap/)), but there are a few projects ahead of it. 

There used to be **9-10 projects ahead of it in Q4 2022**, and now there are **3-4 projects ahead in Q2 2023**. So making progress, but still on the queue..

**Completed Projects that used to be ahead:**

1. Service Nervous System
2. Community Fund
3. Enhance Replica Version Management
4. NNS spam protection (remove financial incentive)
5. Carbon Footprint and Sustainability Policy
6. SNS Core Canisters

**In progress:**

7. Restriction for SNS swap participation
8. One proposal SNS initialization

**Upcoming:**

9. Safe guards for the access to the SNS treasury
10. NNS Neuron ID Indexing
11. *Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees* <--- here it is
12. Manual Voting

Based off our previous conversations, I was under the impression it was a resource thing - was just curious where DFINITY was at with it. I believe this adequately addresses the “Follow-Up”.

Given you have confirmed, it is a matter of time;

If the community provides the code, and submits it manually, or provided it to the NNS team for review for their own submission

Would DFINITY honour the previous governance proposal that has approved this implementation , and vote to approve the code based changes, ahead of the provided schedule?

If anybody submits any code for an update, I am pretty certain engineers at DFINITY would review it (all code is reviewed). More directly: I have not heard any problem with the *desire of feature*, only in urgency at others and resource allocation. 

That said, my personal opinion (based on general experience, not this proposal in specific) is there are many design questions and edge cases in this proposal that will reveal themselves in code/implementation, as in any proposal or project. So it is not just a matter of coding it up, but likely a matter of coding it up... and then iterating on design and edge cases decisions in a dialogue with the community.

For completeness, I would like to add that a design issue related to periodic confirmation of following was already raised, see [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801). Hence, proposed changes to foster decentralization should consider this aspect.

Upon review; it seems your “design flaw” is the mechanism working exactly as intended - decentralizing voting power, and reinforcing the reaffirmation of followees ..?

If the super majority execution of proposals with available VP is the concern, it seems like something that could be solved by making the amount of VP required to enact a super majority, relative to the average amount of VP used within each governance proposal (as it’s one of few reliable samples of active voting power, after a reset) across the last, year, for example.

This would also make governance proposals more than a glorified poll, as they’d directly impact the “super majority weight”.


EDIT: Reflecting, I see a flaw with this, but I believe the workaround is arguably beneficial to governance aswell.

Will publish a draft prop on this soon

Let me get this straight

1. DFINITY creates a problem
2. DFINITY creates a solution for that problem
3. DFINITY adopts the problem
4. DFINITY still hasn’t adopted the solution and is making excuses about Roadmap?

An important clarification…the community proposed the periodic confirmation of neuron followees and the NNS voters adopted it.  DFINITY did not propose it and they did not adopt it.

-------------------------

Zane | 2023-06-05 17:54:49 UTC | #56

Unless I'm missing something the only reason not to implement period reset of followees in the immediate future is it might impact Dfinity's ability to quickly push replica upgrades in case there are vulnerabilities to be fixed or any other kind of issues which requires quick interventions. 

So what if it were initially rolled out only for the governance topic? Governance proposals are non binding and aren't needed in the scenarios Dfinity mentioned, by doing so at least the governance topic will reflect more accurately community's stance and it will act as a testing ground for the feature.

I agree with you @Zane , this would be a great way to test the feature, and ensure sound implementation of functionalities. 

However, I believe this leads into the greater question of, how do we ever get to the point in which DFINITY feels comfortable relinquishing the 98% super majority they’ve assigned themselves? Should they be the ones to decide when they should relinquish this self assigned voting power? 

In my opinion, that should be the responsibility of the neurons who own the voting power, not DFINITY - which is why I believe Periodic Followee Confirmation for all topics is crucial.

I’ve written a draft proposal that I believe, if implemented alongside the Periodic Followee Confirmation proposal, would be a valid solution to the proposed “Design Flaw” with this proposal. Would love to know your thoughts on it;
