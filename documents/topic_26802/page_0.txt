I'd like to put forth an Idea I had while browsing https://internetcomputer.org/ecosystem

I think it would be nice to have a "Staking" category in the showcase, Staking is obviously huge part of most modern cryptocurrencies and you can argue it's a sub-section under DeFi but there is already "Wallet", "Bitcoin" and "Ethereum" categories which could also be considered sub-sections under DeFi. 

So why not add a Staking category?

Currently there is a few dApps on ICP that would fall under the "Staking" category, most notable would be https://nns.ic0.app/, StakedICP, IcDEX (I believe they offer NNS staking) and also our own dApp https://rakeoff.io/. There may very well be others I missed that have some sort of staking.

I think this category would get a good few clicks from people looking to stake ICP.
