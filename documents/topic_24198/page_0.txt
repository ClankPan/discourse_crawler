Dear Team,

I have a questioned for reward on NNS.

Think i have 1000 ICP staked with "dissolve dalay of 6 months (6%)".

After 6 months of staking, let say i have "Age bonus (6%)" thenafter i am dissolving the neuron. So would i get both reward {"Dissolve delay of 6 months (6%)" and "Age bonus (6%)"}, total =12%.

Age bonus accumulates daily, so you don't have to wait 6 months before it starts contributing to your voting rewards.  The moment you start dissolving, the age bonus goes to 0.  The moment you have less than 6 month dissolve delay (e.g. when you start dissolving a neuron with 6 month dissolve delay), then you no longer receive voting rewards.  

So in your example with a neuron with 6 month dissolve delay and not dissolving...
...at 0 months, your age bonus is 0% and your dissolve delay bonus is 6.25%
...at 6 month, your age bonus is 3.125% and your dissolve delay bonus is 6.25%
...at 12 months, assuming you have not dissolved, your age bonus will be 6.25% and your dissolve delay bonus will be 6.25%
...at <6 months, assuming you start dissolving, your age bonus will be 0% and you dissolve delay bonus will be 0%.
You can disperse the staked ICP and staked maturity when the dissolve delay reaches 0.
If you accumulate maturity instead of staking maturity, then you can spawn a neuron of that maturity any time you have more than 1 ICP of maturity.

Note that age bonus and dissolve delay are bonuses that add to your voting power.  Those values are not your returns.  Currently, a neuron with a dissolve delay of 6 months and no age bonus is earning annualized rewards of 8.8%.  A neuron with a dissolve delay of 8 years and no age bonus is earning annualized rewards of 16.6%.

The only small correction: IIRC you need 1.05 maturity since maturity modulation could reduce 1 maturity into less than 1

Thank you for your response, you have provided much clarity for nns reward

can you provide me an understanding on below thing

1) If i staked 100 ICP and my dissolve delay is 6% and i have not participated in voting for 1 year (0 maturity) then after 1 year, if i dissolve my staked ICP, how much ICP will i get.

2 If i staked 100 ICP and my dissolve delay is 6% and i have participated in voting for 1 year (spawn all my maturity time to time) then after 1 year, if i dissolve my staked ICP, how much ICP will i get.

Thank you for your informative reply

Thank you for that info. What benefits are there in starting a neuron with a minimal amount of ICP?

Could you clear something up? I just want to make sure i understand. My question is about the 8.8% rewards. If I'm staking for 6 months do I get that if I have dissolve delay enabled and/or if I'm currently dissolving? Thanks.
