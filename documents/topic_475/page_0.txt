Hey everybody just tried to upgrade to the new version but got the following error:


    Io(
        Custom {
            kind: PermissionDenied,
            error: TarError {
                desc: "failed to unpack `/usr/local/bin/dfx`",
                io: Custom {
                    kind: PermissionDenied,
                    error: TarError {
                        desc: "failed to unpack `./dfx` into `/usr/local/bin/dfx`",
                        io: Os {
                            code: 13,
                            kind: PermissionDenied,
                            message: "Permission denied",
                        },
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    )

As you might have guessed this has to do with permissions around reading and writing to your files. Since it is not in the tutorial I just wanted to mention to beginners that you can fix this by putting 

`sudo` 

in front of the dfx upgrade command.
