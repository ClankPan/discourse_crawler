Hi all
My Nns staking time , max. 8 years, for so called  "8 years gang members" is not 8 years anymore.I have just checked it and was a bit shocked ðŸ˜² . Time is running fast and what seems so far is not that far anymore.Now I am only 6 years and 266 days away.Still ...It is a lot of time ahead .Huh my daughter will be 23 then....I am just thinking loud .
How much time do you have to wait,longer or shorter ?
Check your NNS now

Economically it is convenient to block for 8 years without dissolving. By compound interest after a couple of years in less than what you dissolve you already recover the investment.
