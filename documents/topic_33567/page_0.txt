When upgrading an SNS frontend canister, you need to first "prepare" the assets via `dfx deploy xx --by-proposal` and then "commit" them via proposal. One can manually delete prepared batches if they are not commited.

1. Where exactly is the batch stored. Is it in the asset canister memory?
2. How long are batches kept if they are never commited? Will they remain forever if they are never commited?

Yes, in asset canister memory/heap

If the batch was proposed/evidence was computed then it will be kept forever

Thanks for the prompt reply! 

Could it make sense to delete batches after a while, e.g. 1 month, if they are never committed? To avoid taking up unnecessary memory in case they go forgotten? 

Is it possible to see all non-committed batches of a canister?

Yeah, that could make sense. 1 month sounds like it would be long enough for most governance systems. 

If there is a forgotten batch you get `Canister called `ic0.trap` with message: Batch 14 is already proposed.  Delete or execute it to propose another.` on `dfx deploy --by-proposal`. And if you have the rights to propose a batch you also have the rights to delete a batch, so you wouldn't be blocked  by a forgotten batch

Ah ok, I forgot the fact that only 1 batch can be committed at a time. Thanks :)
