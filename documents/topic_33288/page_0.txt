Introducing [ICPoker](https://icpoker.com). Our goal is to be the world's first fully on-chain, open-source online poker site, owned and operated by a DAO.

Vision:

Anyone who has ever played online poker has had doubts about the fairness of the game. Many online poker sites have been caught red-handed cheating players out of millions of dollars in massive scandals that made headline news. Some of those sites were the biggest in the business at the time and some of those sites still exist today. Yikes!

Online poker sites are licensed and regulated by various jurisdictions around the globe where regulatory authorities are supposed to ensure fairness of games offered by online gaming sites. The players must trust those regulatory authorities to protect them from being cheated because all of the online gaming sites today use proprietary software which is closed source and not available for audit. The players have no way of verifying that the games are fair. They either risk playing in a rigged game or they don’t play at all. What other choice do the players have?

ICPoker will be the world’s first fully on-chain, open source online poker room. Powered by Internet Computer Protocol, the games will be generated using tamper-proof canister smart contracts and the fairness of the games will be verifiable at any time by reviewing the open source code. Online poker players will finally have a safe place to play, a place where they don’t need to trust any central regulatory authority to protect them from being cheated. ICPoker is what players have needed and wanted for decades, but it wasn’t possible until recently, thanks to Internet Computer Protocol’s revolutionary blockchain technology.

Internet Computer Protocol’s technology also allows for true decentralized governance, and ICPoker will take full advantage of this feature. When the dApp is complete, control will be turned over to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) formed by players and investors who wish to participate in ICPoker’s governance. Once the DAO takes control, any changes to the code must be voted on and approved by the DAO.

Additionally, ICPoker will let the players in on the action and give them a chance to be a part of the house. Members of the DAO will be entitled to a significant share of the revenue that the dApp generates. ICPoker will truly be an online poker room that is run by the players for the players. With provably fair games regulated by tamper-proof code and the opportunity to share the profits, why would any player choose to play anywhere but ICPoker?


Please read the [whitepaper](https://icpoker.com/whitepaper/). Feedback, suggestions and questions are most welcome.


We are raising funds for development through Funded. The [crowdfunding campaign](https://funded.app/projects/icpoker-6063753) begins on Monday July 22nd.


ICPoker is just getting started and we are very excited for the future. We look forward to growing together with the ICP ecosystem and community!

Sorry to disappoint you but there's already an on-chain poker site running on the IC, which was the *first*

We had our first event session last weekend, where over 20 players joined.

Oh wow.. We had no idea poker was already being done on the IC, but it's not surprising as it's a great idea. Your project looks great, will have to try it out..

@adamracks, don't lose faith in this mission!

ZkPokerApp is revolutionary and just the beginning. ICP deserves a diverse array of groundbreaking apps like this.

@zk777, this is a clear signal that we need to ramp up zkPoker's marketing. If you kickstart a thread to brainstorm strategies, I'm all in to contribute!

@mycelia Thanks for the kind words! Definitely not giving up. My team and I have a considerable amount of time, effort and money invested at this point. The crowdfunding campaign begins Monday so we are going to see it through. I have a lot of my poker friends hyped up about ICP and they are excited to invest in ICPoker as their first experience with the ecosystem.
