Hi everyone,

We are building a token generation platform designed specifically to empower promising projects within the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem. This platform leverages a DAO structure, allowing users to invest in and support projects they are passionate about, while receiving tokens from those projects in return. I would appreciate any feedback or critiques you may have based on this description. I will be sharing the MVP very soon.

What problem would this be solving? How would it differ to the NNS Launchpad?

That's a good question and something I should think about. Now, our focus is on token economics. We are building an AI-driven tool that provides customized tokenomics templates and recommendations based on the needs and goals of each project. We are partnering with tokenomics experts to enhance our offerings.
