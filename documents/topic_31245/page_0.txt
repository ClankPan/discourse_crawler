With the competition in the L1/L2 space heating up and competitors providing incentives for people to move to your chain, shouldn't ICP be looking at doing something similar by providing a yield on these ck assets being bridged to ICP?

The users can very easily transfer their ckETH to any of the staking/restaking platform on ETH L2s and get a yield (3%+ easily).

Why should they move their assets to ICP.

Hence, I propose there should be a small bridging benefit to the users who bridge their assets to ICP.
