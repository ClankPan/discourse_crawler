I am using the Ledger canister api to get back the blocks, but i can not get the hash of both the block and transaction. I found there are fun inside the ledger-core project, but all of these fun are not pub. Am I missing something or i am going in the wrong way.

Hi @nickcen!

> but I can not get the hash of both the block and transaction

The [ICP ledger specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ledger#_chaining_ledger_blocks) defines the block hash as SHA-256 of the block's serialized (protobuf) representation. Since Protobuf representation is not unique and depends on the library you use, we specified our encoding.

The easiest way to get a block hash from a canister is to fetch the *next* block from the ledger and look at the parent hash of that block.

Transaction hashes are even more extreme: there is no specification for transaction hashes. It's hard to reproduce the exact encoding the ICP ledger canister uses (unless you use the same Rust code).

Could you elaborate a bit on your use case? What is the application that you're trying to build?

Thanks, @roman-kashitsyn . 
Right now, I can pull back all the blocks , and wanna to persist the block into the database, then doing some analysis or an app something similar to the ICP Explorer. 
For the blocks part, I think i can do as you suggest, and sounds that can work.

Do you think if I use something likes rosetta api to fetch the datas, then i can get back the day i want?

Do you pull the blocks into a canister or some service not hosted on the IC?
If it's the latter, then setting up a [rosetta node](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/functionality/rosetta/#the-rosetta-node) and using its [JSON API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/BlockApi.html) is probably the easiest path. That's also how [the IC dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/) works.
Internally, the Rosetta node fetches raw blocks using poorly documented Protobuf API. The node also shares code with the ledger to compute transaction hashes.

I am pulling from service not hosted on the IC. So I will deploy a Rosetta node. Thanks.
