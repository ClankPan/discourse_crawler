How can I verify that two asset canisters serve the same content (i.e. same assets)? Is there a root hash that I can compare? If so, how?

There is a root hash. It's harder to access than it probably should be. But it also doesn't say as much as you'd expect.

Right now the asset canister doesn't have a `get_root_hash` function. But you can extract the root hash from every response to `http_request`. If you e.g. request `/index.html` through a call to `http_request`, you receive back a response with an [`IC-Certificate` header](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec#the-certificate-header). In that header there is a `tree` section. From the spec: `tree: Base64 encoded string of self-describing, CBOR-encoded bytes that decode into a valid hash tree as per certificate encoding.` This will contain the root hash.

If two root hashes match then the two asset canisters serve the same content. If they don't match it could mean any of the following:
* At least one asset doesn't match
* At least one asset's headers don't match
* At least one asset's available encodings don't match
* The certification tree implementation is differently structured (AFAIK the asset canister's tree should be fine)
* The canisters don't handle aliases the same way
* The canisters don't serve the same certification versions

If you don't want to go the root hash route, then your best bet is listing all assets. The asset canister has a `list` function that shows what assets are available. If you then trust the canister to not hide any assets you can compare the assets one by one

An example of using this header and checking the hash tree can be found in the `@dfinity/assets` package: https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/main/packages/assets/src/index.ts#L490
