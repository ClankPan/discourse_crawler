I'm following the Integrate II guide here - https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/user-login/internet-identity/integrate-internet-identity 
But when I deploy canisters and open the front end I notice that the css file must not be working and when I try to login or click the whoami button I get this error : 
Could not find a canister id to forward it to.
Any ideas as to where it's going wrong? What do I need to do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!

Are you still having issues?

1. If you are not too far along, you may want to upgrade `dfx 0.17.0` and follow the [new command line steps to integrate II into a new project](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/user-login/internet-identity/integrate-internet-identity). 

2. If you are far along, where it would take a considerable amount of effort to start over, it seems like your browser is unable to render:

- DFINITY 100% on-chain picture (which is an SVG)
- Center the Login! and Click Me! buttons

Do you have a link to your GitHub repo? What is the browser (and version) that you are using? 

I assume that you are using an extension or a program that is blocking images. It may be affecting CSS rendering as well.
