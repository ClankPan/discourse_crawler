Hi
 Anyone knows if storing large amount of files is cost-wise better on IC or a pinning service of IPFS ?

My scenario is, I want to have a gallery. So I have two approaches:
1- Storing everything(files, metadata, database) on IC
2- Storing files on IFPS and everything else+CIDs on IC

I believe second choice is better becasue of 4G limit of canisters and I see IC as an Internet Computer meaning CPU+RAM and not a hard disk, correct me if wrong? any insights is much appreciated.

I believe someone from dfinity shared a rough estimate of storage cost at around 5$ / GB / year. There's also talk of storage optimized canisters in the future, so that might be an option.
