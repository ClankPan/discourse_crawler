Hi All,

Fantastic workshop today, everyone! As always! I currently have a thread open with an existing conundrum and would really appreciate some help! But after the workshop, I've come up with another.

Using an example from my existing thread:

[quote="KevLoui, post:11, topic:703"]
```
public type Quest = {
    questName: Text;
    questGiver: Text;
    questReward: Text;
    questStatus: Text;
    questAcceptors: [Guild];
    questComplete: Bool;
};
```
[/quote]

I have a `Quest` here that has a `questStatus` characteristic. But what if `questStatus` could also be an image, video, text or collection of all? I have used the `Text` type temporarily as a placeholder, and I heard DHT mentioned by @enzo today. Would that be how to use them all? If so, how? Also, is it necessary that `Quest` has its own type? Could `Quest` somehow be a characteristic of a `Guild` that still contains all of its information?

an easy way would be to host them somewhere else and just save the url which javascript then embeds. i could imagine that you‘d be able to somehow encode an image or  video to binary in a way that js understands it and then load it?

That sounds like a good solution, and probably the way I’d end up doing it, but I wondered if there was a way you could do it internally? Maybe to reduce the amount of outside dependencies? I understand if that isn’t ideal though.

what do you mean by „internally“?

I was thinking that it would be hosted somewhere, and that called in with Motoko, then use javascript to embed the Motoko call? I may be interpreting this very wrong, and this method is probably not worth it.

Use a variant:

```
type QuestStatus =
  { #collection : [QuestStatus]
  ; #image : Url
  ; #text : Text
  ; #video : Url
  }:

type Quest
  { ...
  ; status : QuestStatus
  ; ...
  };
```

This looks like exactly what I’m looking for! I’ll use it and let you know how it goes! Thank you!
