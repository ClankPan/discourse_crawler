## Introduction
The average number of votes cast on governance proposals is 21M, which represents approx 5% of total voting power today. This is a surprisingly low voter turnout. ICP is a governance token. It does not exist for passive investment. Fortunately, the ICP tokenomics are designed to incentivize participation in governance. If you vote, then you get voting rewards. If you do not vote, then you do not get voting rewards. Voting rewards are distributed proportional to the voting power of all the neurons that cast votes. The key to success in maximizing voting rewards is to vote on all proposals.

A proposal ([34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485)) was passed on December 14, 2021 as a motion proposal that suggested two fundamental changes: a) disable default following for proposals on the governance topic and b) weigh the voting rewards based on the topic (Exchange Rate: 0.01; Governance: 20; Other: 1). When this proposal finally gets implemented, there will be a meaningful difference in voting rewards between neurons that vote on governance topics and neurons that do not vote on governance topics. Every neuron owner that wants to maximize voting rewards will want to actively participate in governance.  Higher participation rates on Governance topics should help ensure decentralized decisions that are in the long term best interest of the internet computer.

There are two ways to ensure that your neuron is maximizing voting rewards: 1) manually vote on each proposal or 2) manually configure your neuron with a Followee for the Governance topic that you trust to always vote according to your best interests. Make sure you follow a neuron you trust to vote and make sure you configure your neuron correctly.

## Proposal Strategy
A series of Governance proposals that are intended to advertise all the community neurons, educate the IC governing body on the power of liquid democracy, and educate the IC governing body on how to configure Followees will be submitted to the NNS daily for approximately 30 days. These proposals are intended to use the voting reward system to motivate and increase governance participation.  A consequence of this campaign will be a meaningful increase in voting rewards to neuron owners that manually vote or actively follow other neurons that vote and a meaningful decrease in voting rewards to neuron owners that do not vote or follow neurons that abstain. 

Implementation of proposal 34485 as well as this proposal campaign should stir up discussion about how ICP tokenomics are designed to incentivize active governance participation and how the tokenomics can and should evolve to meet the needs of the IC ecosystem.  It should not take long before people start noticing that their voting rewards have changed significantly each day and they will start asking questions on social media and the forum. Active IC community members will be aware of what is going on and can point them to the NNS dApp to learn more about each topic, configure their Followees, and vote manually. Ideally this program will result in a lot more people configuring Followees for the Governance topic. Hopefully, it also inspires more organizations to set up their own neurons and offer them as reliable Followees to the IC community.

**The goal is for these proposals to result in significant changes in participation rates in NNS voting, but they are not proposals for changes to the IC code. It makes no difference if the proposals pass or fail (although I do hope they pass) because those results will not change the objective of the campaign and anyone is free to submit any proposal any time. It is possible that all 30 proposals will result in loss of 1 ICP each if the proposals do not pass, but it is also possible that they start passing as more people configure their neurons to follow community neurons that vote. A measure of success for this program is to see an increase in total votes cast for each proposal as each is executed over time. A stretch goal is to see over 50% voter participation in each proposal by the end of the campaign.**

Three of these daily proposals are live at the time of this writing.  All known community neurons have already voted, so you will need to vote manually if you don't have a Followee configured for the Governance topic.

## The Plan
The plan is to submit 1 governance proposal per day, but only if there were no other governance proposals already submitted that day. Hence, these proposals will not be submitted until approx 11:00 PM UTC most days.  Potential topics that will be covered in this campaign are listed below. The Summary of the proposal would be a simple 1 - 3 paragraph explanation of each topic and would include links to additional educational material regarding each topic. 

#### Proposal Topic Examples (these topics are subject to change)
1) The strategy and purpose of this new education program regarding governance participation
2) The new weighting system for proposal topics
3) Governance resources: IC Wiki, The Forum, Dashboard, ICP Maximalist Network, Internet Computer Weekly
4) Current known community neurons and an invitation to become a community neuron
5) Why it makes sense for Dfinity and ICA to abstain from Governance proposals
6) How liquid democracy works
7) How to set Followees for the Governance topic
8) The first results of voting participation in this education program
9) Do the whales really control NNS decisions or is it liquid democracy?
10) What proposal topics and types can push code?
11) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 1 Followee is configured; All Topics and Governance Topics
12) The purpose of voting rewards...to incentivize governance participation
13) Update on known community neurons
14) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 2 Followees are configured
15) Why it makes sense for Dfinity and ICA to vote on Governance proposals
16) How a neuron becomes a named Followee in the NNS dApp
17) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 15 Followees are configured
18) Why it's important for organizations to create neurons that can become named Followees in the NNS dApp
19) Midway results of voting participation in this education program
20) Another update on known community neurons
21) Current voting power of DF and ICA
22) Suggestions for best practices for how organizations can configure their Followee neuron
23) Current options for how a named Followee neuron can be created and managed
24) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 3 Followees are configured
25) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 4 Followees are configured
26) Current histogram of voting power by dissolve delay
27) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 10 Followees are configured
28) Best practices for submitting and advocating NNS proposals by the IC community
29) How the NNS decides how a neuron votes if 5 Followees are configured
30) Final update on known community neurons
31) Final results of voting participation in this education program...did it work

## Important Disclaimer
Please note that I advocate for having many options for Followees in the IC community. This campaign will have a strong tone of encouraging new organizations to create Followee neurons. Personally, I think it would be a bad situation to see the named Followee list in the NNS dApp have only a couple of options that gain a lot of voting power. I want to inspire much more decentralized governance participation. Hence, this education campaign is not an advertisement for people to follow any specific neuron.

In my opinion, community neurons should also offer transparency regarding who is voting, how they vote, how their neuron is managed, and how much voting power they have through liquid democracy.  None of this is required, but these are the things I would be looking for as a community member who is trying to decide who to follow.

For anyone who wants their community neuron to be included in this proposals campaign, please send me a DM here on the forum, on Twitter [@BartlettWenzel](https://twitter.com/BartlettWenzel), or on DSCVR, Distrikt, or OpenChat @wpb.  Also feel free to simply post your information in a comment here on this forum topic.

## IC Governance Website
I also believe there is a need to develop a website that is focused on IC governance in a way that makes it easy for the community to participate in governance as well as monitor governance participation rates and tokenomic incentive effectiveness.  I see it as critical infrastructure for the IC.  Please reach out to me if you are interested in assisting with this project.  There will be an advisory board to ensure that the website is built with features that the community believes are important, but it will start as an MVP.  It will also be necessary to find UI/UX, Front End, and Back End developers to build this website.

wpb | 2022-02-05 03:34:39 UTC | #2

To be clear, proposal 34485 has not been implemented yet.  Meaningful changes in voting rewards will not occur until that proposal is implemented.

What I’m about to say is not intended to characterize what you’re doing as spam. You seem to acknowledge in one of the proposals that they may be perceived as such, and to some extent I agree, but I’m not trying to make that argument here. The system allows you to do this.

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:10706"]
It is possible that all 30 proposals will result in loss of 1 ICP each if the proposals do not pass
[/quote]

I think this is probably at least worth a conversation (if not a full analysis) of how the penalty for submitting a spam proposal is far outweighed by the ICP minted in voting rewards.

I believe this could create incentives for spam proposals to be submitted as they would always result in a net positive for voters.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-02-06 18:20:42 UTC | #4

Somewhat unrelated, but I think a great way to increase voting participation is simply sending an email to the neuron holder whenever a governance proposal is submitted. That would put proposals directly on people's radar without having to remember to check the forum, the NNS dapp, Twitter, etc.

It should be opt-in.

The main blocker for this right now (I think) is the inability for a canister to make outgoing requests, like sending an email...

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-06 18:38:29 UTC | #5

Agreed.  That is a feature that I really want to build into the website that I mentioned at the end of the OP above.  It would be nice to have opt-in push notification options via email, text, and/or various other forms of social media.  

The two options that I'm aware of right now are:
1) NNS Proposals bot that Christian Miller has developed for Telegram 
a) DM to @NNSProposalsBot and then send message "/governance_only"
2) NNS Proposals bot that Jordon Last developed for OpenChat 
a) https://twitter.com/lastmjs/status/1487126882017497090?s=20&t=D6AkDEu8X1scEhlwBwQW7A

Both bots push notifications to whoever sets them up.

coteclaude | 2022-02-06 20:14:36 UTC | #6

There is something I would like to know about voting and having multiple following neurons.  According to @jwiegley and if I understood right, if the I follow 3 neurons like Dfinity, Foundation and ICPmax, and Dfinity + Foundation do not vote, I will not cast any vote even if ICPmax vote because more then 50% of my following are not voting.  Is this correct?

Does ICPmax vote on everything or only on governance?

Haven't found any clear explanations yet.
I am waiting for these clarification to reconfigure my neurons accordingly.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-06 21:14:34 UTC | #7

I plan to offer this clarification in some upcoming proposals.  Since you asked, I will also clarify here in advance.

When you set Followees in any category, your neuron votes according to the rules of Absolute Majority.  This means your neuron will vote Yes on a proposal when greater than 50% of your Followees vote Yes and it will vote No when greater than or equal to 50% of your Followees vote No.  This is really important to understand.  If neither condition is met, then your neuron will Abstain.  The example below is intended to highlight the point.

For 4 Followees:
If 3 or 4 Followees vote Yes then your neuron will vote Yes
If 2, 3, or 4 Followees vote No then your neuron will vote No
If 2 Followees vote Yes and 1 Followee votes No, then your neuron will Abstain

The All Topics category is a catch all that will cover any category where you have not specified a Followee.  If you have specified Followees for a given topic such as Governance, then they will decide your neurons vote for that category and the Followee designation you have for All Topics is not relevant to that topic.

It is important to note that Dfinity Foundation and Internet Computer Association have made the commitment to Abstain from voting on Governance motion proposals.  Their record has reflected that policy since Nov 8, 2021 when Simple Majority was implemented.  In fact, this policy has really been in place since genesis.  Prior to Nov 8, they only voted because it was required to achieve Absolute Majority, which was the only voting mechanism in place at the time.  Their policy was to let the community vote and then they would cast their vote with the majority in the final hour so that Absolute Majority could be realized.  Long story short, DF and ICA will not be a reliable Followee for the Governance topic.

To your second question...the ICP Maximalist Network neuron is configured with Dfinity Foundation for All Topics and is configured with 14 Followees for the Governance Topic.  [Here](https://www.ic.community/icpmn-neuron-followees-aka-voting-members/) is a list of the Followees that were elected to vote on the Governance topic for the ICP Maximalist Network neuron.  All voting members have made the commitment that the ICP Maximalist Network neuron will always cast a vote to Adopt or Reject every proposal with zero Abstain results.  The NNS dApp is used to cast individual votes by the voting members

cycledao.xyx and ICDevs.org have made similar commitments.  I'm sure that @Arthur  and @skilesare  would be willing to provide further clarification.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-02-06 21:46:48 UTC | #8

I was already following ICP maximalist network on all topics.  So basically I can remove all others and I will vote on 100% of the proposal, right?

@wpb Thanks for all your hard work and commitment.  Very impressive by the way.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-06 22:21:21 UTC | #9

Thank you.  

Yes, I do think that the ICP Maximalist Network neuron has you covered simply because the ICPMN neuron is configured to follow Dfinity Foundation for All Topics.  I don't want to go so far as to advise people to follow ICPMN for All Topics, but if you do it should still guarantee that you vote according the the DF vote.  The only exception will be if the ICPMN voting members feel it is important to vote manually on a non-Governance topic.  That will happen some day as the IC evolves toward further decentralization, but I don't see that happening in the near future.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-02-07 07:06:30 UTC | #10

The only thing to note about your scenario is that it matters whether you follow all three *specifically for that topic*, or only ICPmax for only the governance topic.

- If you follow the Foundation and ICA for "All Topics", and ICPmax for just "Governance", then you will vote for everything, since only ICPmax will be considered for votes on Governance.

- If you follow all three under the "Governance" topic, then yes, at least 2 have to vote yes or no for you to vote.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-02-07 12:34:46 UTC | #11

Thank you John.   This is such an important clarification.  I had no clue that if you choose one for Governance, it would ignore all neurons configured in ALL TOPICS as far as governance proposals.  This is a huge difference.  Not I get it clear

I know it is done in Quill but may I ask if the MERGE NEURON button soon to appear in the NSS front end?

Thanks again.

[/quote]

ICDevs is currently a bit ad-hoc but we will be moving to a DAO-based voting system for casting our vote on governance topics.  Our intent is to vote on items that have some effect on developers and the developer ecosystem.  When not voting we currently follow Cycle_dao and ICPMN so we should still vote for all items.  Members of our developer advisory committee will eventually be able to add new follow neurons to this as well.  I'm working on a page on at icdevs.org to lay this information out more clearly.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2022-02-07 18:30:35 UTC | #13

I really like this. It's a great catalyst for the conversation about the importance of voting and following.

Regarding the commitment to always vote. Yes. We will never abstain.

Based on these changes, the UI of the NNS should definitely be updated.

For reference - current state of the NNS follow UI. **This UI misrepresents what is required of a more passive voter**, or one that has not kept up with the latest voting changes on this forum/twitter as it implies that choosing any of the default follower options on All Topics (i.e. Internet Computer Association) will apply to governance proposals. 

![Screen Shot 2022-02-15 at 10.15.47|442x500](upload://u2zT615jS9ZRWHdMcIbrsNRRPxH.png)
<br/>

Below is my opinion of some minimal improvements that would help to fix this issue, leading new users to choose governance followees (and non miss out on voting/rewards out of confusion).

**Changes**:

* Under each of the topics, the voting reward weight for being a participant should be listed (so the user can see that governance voting rewards > exchange rate, etc.)

* **"All Topics"** -> **All Non-Governance Topics"**. Update the description accordingly

* There should be a toggle dropdown next to the "All Non-Governance Topics" option that upon clicked expand to each of the topics within it that can be configured individually

* **"Governance"** should be then listed at the same top level from *All Non-Governance Topics" (2 top level topics, with the "All Non-Governance Topics" having a ">" for dropdown into the second level of topics).

As an add on to this, I would recommend having links to official voting documentation that is up to date and has guides on setting up, policies, etc. - vs. having to search elsewhere.

-------------------------

hugoelec | 2022-02-20 18:10:08 UTC | #15

recently I try to read those proposals and click on the hyperlinks of them, none of them are working.
A link is a link it shouldn't need a marking for it to work, otherwise how could it be voted on? although I couldn't understand most of them, but at least I try to study it.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-20 18:58:01 UTC | #16

You are right that links are not working for the proposal in the NNS dApp.  It would be helpful if they would work.  

In the meantime, here is a link to the dashboard where the links do work.  This link is configured to filter all proposals by Governance so you will always see the latest Governance proposals.

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance?s=25&topic=TOPIC_GOVERNANCE

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-02-20 19:03:28 UTC | #17

If we are requesting UI changes, I'd love it if the Neuron Management topic could be added back with a proper description of what it does.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-20 19:06:01 UTC | #18

I think your suggestions would make a good governance proposal.  Do you want to create a new forum topic under the Governance category in order to start deliberation?  I would be happy to submit it as an NNS proposal for you if needed after you feel it is ready, but you can also submit it yourself.

I agree with bullet 1.  I think bullet 2 has already been implemented.  It seems bullet 3 and 4 are part of the same change, which I agree with as well.  Regarding the last paragraph…I don’t understand.  It might need further clarification.  

Let me know how I can help you your proposal.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-02-24 08:17:17 UTC | #19

Does anyone know how I can vote differently than how my followee neuron voted on a particular proposal?

I just see a thumbs-up next to my following neurons but no option to override or manually cast my own vote.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-24 14:36:45 UTC | #20

It is not currently possible to change your vote after your Followee has voted, but [proposal 38985](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985), which passed in mid January, aimed to address this issue.  Dfinity Foundation (@lara) has indicated that the feature may be available some time in 2Q 2022.  If you want to vote manually today, you must do it before your Followee(s) votes.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-02-24 22:27:33 UTC | #21

@wpb is there any feature that would allow us to know when a proposal is live so we can vote quickly or remove a follow beforehand if we wish to have full control over our vote?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-24 23:31:16 UTC | #22

This [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposals-to-increase-voting-participation-on-governance-topics/10706/5?u=wpb) references two push notification options.  These are the only options I know at this time.

-------------------------

icme | 2022-02-25 00:33:13 UTC | #23

Regarding the last paragraph, it would be nice if the NNS app had official up-to-date links to tutorials and how-tos directly in the app. This reduces the possibility of someone going to an external site, and then say staking changes and they end up being confused when they come to the actual NNS app. Those guides will still exist, but it's always nice to have an official link to documentation in the app to settle any discrepancies.

This is as simple of a change as including a link on the neuron tab or voting tab, etc. to an official dfinity.org page or DFINITY maintained medium article/YouTube video. Maybe even a FAQ tab in the NNS. I'm not a UX designer so I can't speak to the specifics, but hopefully this clarifies my more general ask.

Crypto has a ton of scammy how-to type of sites, we just want to make sure that people coming to the NNS have access to up-to-date, factual information - this will decrease bounce rate, increase understanding, and drive adoption (and staking)

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-02-28 08:14:09 UTC | #24

I'm glad you mentioned this. I'd like to propose a topic for discussion on this point.

It is apparent to many in the community, after this educational exercise, that the submission of governance proposals provides significantly higher maturity rewards when there are less voters. This introduces a vulnerability, as mentioned, whereby a neuron that aims to earn more than 1ICP per day (the cost of a proposal), they could indefinitely boost earnings through daily governance proposals. The proposals would not need to be approved to earn the 20 weight maturity.

To combat this, a rejected governance proposal should have a much lower weight. At least as low as a regular proposal: 1. Which would lower rewards earned by those rejecting the proposal, keeping the network safe; but also eliminating the vulnerability.

-------------------------

evgen-povt | 2022-02-28 08:40:47 UTC | #25

It will incentivise the voters to accept proposals rather than reject, no matter what the proposals are.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-02-28 09:00:58 UTC | #26

I am afraid that such a model would motivate people to vote « yes » to every governance proposals, just to not miss out the highest rewards. As long as the rewards are equal, rejected or not, people can vote freely, but by weighting differently the execution or the rejection will turn into a incentivizing to vote « yes », whatever the matter of the proposal. They would develop the habit of just voting yes, sometimes by going against their own negative advice, just to maximize the rewards, sometimes by not even reading the proposal. It could be eventually very risky, because it is possible that people would always vote yes, even if a nefarious proposal occurs. Let us be very careful here.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 10:20:23 UTC | #27

@romain we have already created a system that incentivizes people to create dummy proposals just for the sake of increasing rewards. By introducing this change I think we will be giving stakeholders a tool to combat spam proposals without increasing the cost to submit a proposal.

I agree that some stakeholders will vote yes simply for rewards but I doubt major voting neurons will.

If this change is not sufficient I would ask for an alternative. Perhaps we should roll this change back all together.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-02-28 10:40:44 UTC | #28

This is why I may be look like crazy, but I am believing that the previous system, where all proposal were equally weighted, should be set up back. What do you all think about this ?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 10:41:33 UTC | #29

That might be the route to go down. But I’d still like to give @weedpatch2 proposal a shot first. If we can keep the new weighting while maintaining the integrity of the system it would be a win/win.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-02-28 12:46:23 UTC | #30

Never underestimate the unintended consequences.  But if there are potential voters who do not vote, why should voters who do vote be penalized? Your contention,  that a rejected proposal is worth less, does not play out in real world. The proposals would then be worded so that a rejected proposal could also be detrimental, no?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 12:58:42 UTC | #31

Do you believe most voters actually vote manually or just follow a registered neuron? If it’s the latter, what makes those people any different than the people who were voting through liquid democracy before the recent change to remove Dfinity as the default followee?

Personally, what I see playing out right now is that a bunch of stakeholders got rugged by an NNS change and now everyone wants to bank extra rewards while the victims are left unaware.

What if someone only merges maturity once a quarter or once every 6 months? Why should they be left out simply because they don’t log in as often as someone else?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-28 13:06:20 UTC | #32

At first I liked this idea of weighting rejected proposals less than approved proposals, but as others have already pointed out, it will incentivize people to vote yes to all governance proposals.  Hence, that may not be the right deterrent from making proposals that don’t bring value.

I’m also not a fan of increasing the cost to make a proposal because it seems that would move us away from the goal of decentralization.  Using proposal price as a deterrent prohibits smaller investors from participating.

I think we need a weighted proposal system to incentivize the IC community to step up and make proposals that they believe would improve the system.  Virtually all proposals other than the current daily governance proposal campaign have been initiated by Dfinity and I suspect everyone would agree that more community engagement in this area is important to decentralization.

As a reminder, this daily governance proposal campaign has a functional purpose, which is to increase awareness, educate the community, and help facilitate an increase in governance participation.  I would rather a large portion of the voting body configure their neurons during this campaign when the results of the votes do not matter than waiting until a major proposal comes along and only a small portion of the governing body is participating.  

This daily proposal campaign will not continue past the 30 days that was originally outlined.  Others are welcome to make governance proposals and I highly encourage those proposals to be actionable and well deliberated on the forum. It remains to be seen if we will have a problem with proposals that do not bring value, but if we do I think we should deal with it at that time.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-28 13:44:10 UTC | #33

ICP tokenomics has never been presented as a passive investment.  Voting rewards are intended to incentivize participation.  Some people will want a more passive approach and will get the lower voting rewards that come from their current neuron configuration to vote on routine business only.  Others will want to maximize voting rewards by voting on everything.  Either way, only active participation is rewarded at whatever level is chosen.

I don’t think this change in proposal weights and following map can be characterized as a rug pull.  This change was first presented in the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172) at the end of  November and deliberated for 2 weeks.  The NNS vote on proposal [34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485) was overwhelmingly in favor.  This daily proposal campaign started 15 days before the change was implemented.  The change was widely communicated on all social media platforms.  

Hence, in my opinion, all reasonable attempts to communicate his change have been made and it is up to each individual neuron owner to pay attention and respond accordingly.  This includes voicing an opinion of opposition to this change, which so far has not happened.  It would be helpful if anyone in opposition would speak up so everyone can take their user experience into account.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 13:55:04 UTC | #34

The tokenomics are actually designed that way. That's how liquid democracy works. The people who are being rewarded now are not doing any more work than the people who are no longer getting rewards. There is zero extra effort involved in following ICPMN or Cycle_DAO versus following Dfinity after Genesis and doing so does not suddenly qualify you as an "active voter".

Trying to argue that these people aren't "active voters" simply because they don't live on social media or on these forums is wrong IMO. These people committed funds to the network; therefore, they have done their part to contribute. The system offered them the option of earning rewards through liquid democracy and that's what they did. They shouldn't be punished just because they choose to not live in the crypto sphere.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-02-28 14:31:37 UTC | #35

#1 - I love that these conversations are occurring and that they are occurring in public.  Civil discussion only strengthens the governance of the IC.  I really think the NNS community is laying the ground work for how a DAO should operate.  Thanks for bringing your opposition to this forum!

#2 - The discussion may benefit from a framing of "prior to the change" and "post change".  What I mean is that prior to the change almost every neuron was following dfinity of ICA by default (this default was setup mid-2021 when a lot of users were complaining about not getting rewards for failing to vote), which posed problems for liquid democracy.  However, by removing that default, it has forced every neuron owner to make a choice on next steps (follow another neuron or vote manually).  The change resolved the issue of the default dfinity/ICA follow.  However, "post change" it does seem reasonable that people should be able to follow dfinity/ICA for governance topic, should they choose to do so (particularly since both have started voting on governance topics again).  Doing so would be an active choice at this point.  Perhaps a suggested next step would be to add back the dfinity and ICA neurons to the named neuron list for goverance topics?

k than the people who are no longer getting rewards. There is zero extra effort involved in following ICPMN or Cycle_DAO versus following Dfinity after Genesis and doing so does not suddenly qualify you as an “active voter”.

Trying to argue that these people aren’t “active voters” simply because they don’t live on social media or on these forums is wrong IMO. These people committed funds to the network; therefore, they have done their part to contribute. The system offered them the option of earning rewards through liquid democracy and that’s what they did. They shouldn’t be punished just because they choose to not live in the crypto sphere.

I don't think those who did not switch followee are punished. They simply did not get the bonus.

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 14:46:35 UTC | #37

Thanks for the reply Kyle!

I just want to clarify. I am not arguing against the change to remove Dfinity as the default followee. I think that was a great move for decentralization of the NNS. I’m arguing against the extra weighting of governance proposals. At the very least I would like to implement some lever (like the .1 reject weighting) that the community can pull if the system is being abused.

Because of the way these changes were rolled out I don’t think anyone understood their combined impact. Since both changes went into effect there has been a massive spike in daily maturity for anyone who has been voting manually or voting through liquid democracy (following ICPMN or Cycle_DAO).

But, as you know, these rewards are not coming from thin air. This change in maturity means there are other stakeholders who are now getting significantly less rewards because they were following Dfinity prior to this change.

I commend @wpb for his education campaign and I think it has been very successful at raising awareness for people who actively merge maturity in the NNS or are active on Twitter, Telegram, and on these forums.

However, there is clearly still a group of stakeholders who do not know about these changes and I don’t think it’s fair to tell them tough luck.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 14:48:36 UTC | #38

It’s not a bonus. That’s what I’m trying to point out. It’s a redistribution of the overall pie. These people would have normally gotten a piece of that pie even under the new weighting’s except their follower settings were changed without their consent.

These two changes, when looked at individually, seem innocent enough; but, they are now actually have a negative effect on people who don’t even realize it

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-02-28 14:55:23 UTC | #39

I totally agree with you. Most people (me included) would be following a neuron.

 Unfortunately,  because of the way the system is setup, if one doesn't play, one does not win. In this case, if one doesn't follow the forum, one doesn’t know that the rules have changed to follow some other neurons.

Secondly if one doesn’t compound maturity,  it's a big loss at the end of 8 years.

Logically if one plays, hopefully one plays to win , though.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 14:59:15 UTC | #40

I would agree with that if the rules hadn't changed.

There was no notice in the NNS that says "Passive stakeholders must check the forum or risk losing your rewards. Please consider before locking your funds for 8 YEARS"

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-02-28 15:08:49 UTC | #41

And it gets even worse than that. Currently dfinity foundation & likely ICA would not participate in add followee proposals (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-include-cycle-dao-icdevs-as-default-follow-target-neurons-to-the-nns/9363/218).

So one can simply exclude 100m votes by only churning out add followee governance proposals; if one is so inclined to do. As a matter of fact, that is EXACTLY, what is contemplated here(https://www.reddit.com/r/ICPTrader/comments/t1wljd/earn_215_apy/).

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-02-28 17:07:23 UTC | #42

Despite being on the reddit and developer forums, I missed an important aspect of the tokenomics change. I had neurons configured months ago to follow Dfinity and ICA, like everyone else, and had added Cycle-Dao for governance proposals even before the named-neuron development. So, I thought I was covered, until I realised I had to specifically *unfollow* Dfinity and ICA on governance, because if two out of three neurons one is following abstain, that means the majority hasn't voted and your own neuron doesn't vote either and loses voting rewards. At least that is my current understanding, correct me if I am mistaken.
What I think might be happening is that many stakers have made the same error, believing that simply adding a neuron to follow for governance does the trick and failing to unfollow the two original default neurons.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-02-28 18:22:30 UTC | #43

I’m getting a lot of push back on Twitter about my statement that this was a “massive mistake”. I will go ahead and apologize for being so dramatic. But I do feel strongly about this topic.

If we, the community, are going to start distinguishing between active and inactive voters can we at least come up with a definition of what being an active voter means?

For example. I recall someone in the past proposing a monthly reset of every neuron’s follower settings. Why not adopt something like that? This way it’s at least well known what the minimum expectation is going forward.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-02-28 20:13:46 UTC | #44

This is a very good question @LightningLad91.  I'm interested in what others think as well.  

I would define an active participant as someone who is voting.  There is a spectrum of how active we are as a participant.  The option exists to engage on the forum and social media to whatever extent we choose and to manually vote on everything.  The option also exists to allow others to vote for us, but we are still personally responsible for making sure we vote if our goal is to maximize voting rewards.

Another way to ask this question might be to focus on entitlement.  As I interpret the tokenomics white papers, staking ICP does not entitle anyone to voting rewards.  Only voting entitles people to voting rewards.  Each of us are entitled to the ICP we currently own, but we are not entitled to future rewards unless we perform the work that is required to earn voting rewards, which is to vote.

-------------------------

Hala | 2022-02-28 20:26:47 UTC | #45

I'm personally not a fan of having automated followers/followees. Why don't we get rid of it all together and only reward those who vote manually as there is no other way. People have to work for their rewards. It literally doesn't take a few minutes to vote. To make the whole system decentralized we need to remove this automation in votes it's absurd. So many get rewarded and have no idea what they voted on so their vote weighs no real value. When there is an incentive to vote manually people will do it then the rewards will be more valuable and have a meaning.

Uh oh, this clearly seems like a bug.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-03-01 03:45:20 UTC | #48

What is the bug? Isn't it working as expected? No votes,  no rewards. If people cannot be bothered to keep up with the changes in a democracy,  then should they partake in it's benefits? If they play by the rules and score a touchdown, well, they scored a touchdown. Yeah, the rules were changed. But it is your responsibility to keep in touch with the changing rules.

The above is one view. The second view is that tweaking these tokenomics rules as a part of governance is FUNDAMENTALLY different than the technical aspects of IC. When the coins were bought, there was a tacit understanding of how the tokenomics would work (& that the tokenomics wouldn't change ). Once one begins to tweak the tokenomics, there are unintended consequences. 

I myself fall in the second camp. If one game plays out if we follow the first view, the technical amongst us will benefit the most IN THE SHORT TERM. However this will cause significant LONG TERM issues.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-03-01 11:16:28 UTC | #49

This is a very convenient definition that doesn’t really help anyone understand what is expected of them. All it does it tell people that they better watch out because someone can come along at anytime and upend their plans.

[/quote]

The people that are losing rewards right now did not fail to vote. They were voting, the same way ICPMN followers vote today, through liquid democracy. 

I think @Motokoder described the responsibility of the casual stakeholder pretty well in this tweet:

https://twitter.com/motokoder/status/1498601970440945669?s=21

Everyone talks about stakeholders obligations to be “active voters” and how the system is not designed to be a passive income generator. But the truth is that’s exactly how the system is designed.

Most stakeholders do not understand, nor should they really need to understand, the intricacy of every proposal. Trying to force every stakeholder to be active will never scale. The backbone of the internet is not going to be micromanaged by a billion people around the world. The system accounts for this with liquid democracy. Liquid democracy allows everyone to participate in governance by making a contribution to the network and delegating their voting power to someone or some group they believe in. Their support adds weight to the target neuron’s vote and that is their contribution. 

What we are saying now, is that’s not enough. Now in order to be considered an “active voter” you must read every proposal and stay up to date with every change or you might get run over. This defeats the entire point of liquid democracy and it will not scale.

I think these daily governance proposals need to end (unless there’s one that actually proposes meaningful change) and I think we need to watch for any abuse of the system. If this new weighting continues to be abused we should put something in place to combat that abuse or revert this weighting change.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-01 23:19:26 UTC | #51

I don’t think active voter means you have to stay up to date on every proposal.

Your suggestion to end the daily proposal campaign is actionable, so I submitted it today.  I will be voting to approve ending the daily proposals.  My hope is that this proposal will stimulate discussion.  @paulyoung expressed concerns early on and you both have valid points that should be discussed.

This is a good point.  I’ve never considered that lack of translation to other languages for NNS proposals could lead to less voter participation.  That should be a greater topic of discussion.

这是个好观点。我没有考虑到NNS提案缺乏其他语言的翻译会导致选民参与度下降。这应该是一个更大的讨论话题。

jwiegley | 2022-03-02 06:10:42 UTC | #54

The Neuron Management topic allows neurons _that you explicitly follow for this topic_ to manage your neuron via proposals under that topic. Thus, a neuron that you follow under the Neuron Management topic could stop your neuron from dissolving via a proposal, for example.

I hope you understand the problem I'm having. What is the expectation? If we're going to use the "active voter" justification then we should be able to define what that expectation is going forward. Should users log in every 2 weeks? 4 weeks? Every quarter?

If the answer is "they should just know to pay attention" then this brings us back to having every stakeholder stay up to date on every proposal.

I think this discussion is worth having a separate topic. I started another thread if you are interested.

wpb | 2022-03-02 15:19:39 UTC | #56

I probably don't understand the issue.  I use the term "active" because I spend a lot of time trying to explain my interpretation of the tokenomics and governance system and it seem like a useful term in those descriptions.  Maybe I am somehow causing unintentional confusion.

Let me try to explain another way without using that term...

Staking entitles people to vote.  Voting entitles people to voting rewards.  Followee assignments enable people to assign their voting power to other people.  The tokenomics and governance structure has a lot of mutable features by way of decentralized decision making through the NNS.  Hence, each person who stakes is responsible for making sure they are voting at any point in time.

I also don't feel like I'm trying to justify anything.  I'm just trying to explain what I think I understand.  I am also trying to do my part to communicate changes widely so people are aware and can respond accordingly.

I acknowledge this truth. AFAIK the entire IC is mutable. The ledger itself is subject to the will of the NNS. We as stakeholders have a responsibility to not exploit this mutability for our own gain. I think what has happened sets a dangerous precedent and we should consider the long term implications of that.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-03-02 16:22:33 UTC | #58

Yes. Exactly. It used to be in the interface and was not really labeled well. It was removed. It would be nice to have it back for neuron management purposes. Right now you have to hack the UI by putting a breakpoint in and changing the follow topic.

It would be nice if it was a separate section like Hotkeys that had some description about what you are doing and then allow you to set the neuron management followers.

For example...here are the now outdated instructions from the v1 nns:

#### using nns:

Follow Neuron 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic(instructions). This is a bit more complicated as it still requires using the web console. Using chrome:

1. Log into the NNS and navigate to the neuron you want to dedicate.
2. Right click and “Inspect”
3. Go to the Sources Tab and navigate to top/nns.ic0.app/ic_agent.js
4. Search for “this.follow = async (request)” (about line 1793)
5. Add a breakpoint on the next line by clicking the line number. This line should say something like “const rawRequest = this.requestConverters.fromFollowRequest(request)”
6. Leave the console open and go to the “Following” box.
7. Click Edit Followees.
8. Click A topic for which you have 0 followees. ie “Exchange Rate”
9. Expand the topic and click Add Followee
10. Put 14231996777861930328 in the Followee Address box and click “Follow Neuron”.
11. Your breakpoint should trigger.
12. Hold your mouse over the ‘request’ variable on the line. This should bring up an interface to edit the properties of the request.
13. Change the topic to 1.
14. Click the “play” button.
15. Confirm that your neuron now follows 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-02 17:05:56 UTC | #59

@jwiegley expanding on the point made by @skilesare, I would really to see all features of ManageNeuron to be built into the NNS dApp.  Specifically, I want to be able to assign control of the ICPMN neuron to a group so any change to the neuron management is up to those Followees to decide by way of private proposals that can only be seen and voted by those voting members.  This includes adding/removing Followees to topics as well as manually voting on proposals that are a topic where Followees are not directly configured.  There is no need to disperse, but there is a need to manage the neuron by a group through the NNS dApp.  DFX command line configuration for these features is too complicated.

I agree there is a chance that the weighted proposals can be misused and we should be ready to respond accordingly.

The daily governance proposal campaign is now complete.  It ran for 29 days.  The first 15 days were subject to the original proposal weights, which were all equal.  The last 14 days of the campaign were subject to changes in the default Followee configuration for the Governance topic as well as the new proposal topic weights that affect voting rewards.  These changes were approved with proposal [34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485) in December 2021 and implemented on 2/15/22 with proposal [44947](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/44947).  

A [list of all the daily governance proposals](https://medium.com/@wpbartlett/list-of-daily-governance-proposals-d835b9b935dc) has been published and each of them can be found on the dashboard.  Since each of the proposals were intended to be educational, the IC community can reference them to learn more about how to participate in governance and how to maximize voting rewards.  In the coming weeks a more detailed analysis of the background, goals, and results of this campaign will be published.

The plot below shows changes in voting participation that occurred throughout this campaign.  As expected, a sharp increase occurred after the tokenomics incentives were implemented.  It is evident that voting participation on governance proposals is now at approx 45% of total voting power and will likely go up from there on future governance proposals.  The daily governance proposals are shown in blue while various other governance proposals that were submitted in this timeframe are shown in red.  All proposals were adopted except ICDevs during this time frame.

I'm still trying to make sure I've got this correct, but I'm not sure all of the increases in governance participation are organic and decentralizing.

DFINITY and the ICA have started voting in governance proposals, that seems to be why there's a sharp uptick in participation. If I'm not mistaken this is the opposite of what we wanted to happen.

Am I interpreting the dashboard incorrectly? It looks like DFINITY and the ICA have started voting at least since proposal 46398 (just because I can see their vote in the UI). But I imagine they started voting before that. Seems to me like the huge increase is from DFINITY and the ICA voting.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-09 16:15:32 UTC | #64

Neurons 27 and 28 voted on proposals starting on 2/21 in the plot.  Their votes did cause a lot of voting power to be executed.  I have no idea how much voting power was cast by neurons they control versus neurons that follow them through liquid democracy.  

Excluding that big jump, there are interesting trends in the positive direction before and after that jump that is not likely to be attributed to DF and ICA.  

Personally, I don’t have any issue with DF and ICA casting votes at their own discretion on governance proposals.  It makes sense for them to vote for what they believe is in the long term best interest of the IC like everyone else.  

The community focus should be on continuing to increase voter participation to further improve decentralized governance decisions.  There is still a lot of voting power that is not voting.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-09 16:35:40 UTC | #65

My main issue is that they had publicly committed to not voting on governance proposals (actually, did they ever commit to this?) and then started voting with no explanation (explanation coming soon: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-process-does-the-dfinity-foundation-use-to-vote-on-nns-proposals/11385/4).

I agree as long as we're on the path to decentralization and they don't have too much voting power, I am fine with DFINITY/ICA voting.
