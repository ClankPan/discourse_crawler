https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual#inspect tells about the function `inspect` and https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/message-inspection tells about the function `canister_inspect_message`. What is the difference and which of the two functions to use against cycles-drain attack?

`inspect` is the higher level function that's exposed in Motoko when you write your canister. `canister_inspect_message` is the lower level function that needs to be exported in your canister's Wasm (so when Motoko compiles the code it'll put whatever you have in your `inspect` to a Wasm function called `canister_inspect_message`). If you look more carefully, the second link you shared mentions `canister_inspect_message` as a reference from the [Interface spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-inspect-message) where the method is formally specified.

There's no difference as I explained above, it's essentially how Motoko exposes to you the lower level `canister_inspect_message` available on ICP.
