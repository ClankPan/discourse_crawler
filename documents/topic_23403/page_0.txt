# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/ca5e5052886de781021506814d2c6502e375da48/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c ca5e5052886de781021506814d2c6502e375da48
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

And there is another "feature build" that enables [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) protocol for state sync. We would like to deploy it to a subset of subnets again.

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, and @ilbert.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @Gekctek and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here if you have any questions or suggestions.

Hey @sat would you please let the change owners for 124857 know that @cyberowl had a few comments and questions about some of the details in commits `[09d6aa3d4]`, `[660899bd2]`, and `[56800b234]` that they might want to review.  He provided more details in his review posted in the CodeGov portal in DSCVR.  Here are the relevant screen shots...

re [[56800b234](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/56800b234)]

You are correct, queries and update calls are mixed up on our dashboard. Thanks for spotting this. I will fix this soon.

Re [[[09d6aa3d4]](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/09d6aa3d4)] and [[660899bd2]](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/660899bd2)

Thanks for catching some of the typos, indeed these were missed.

The change to principal id was made because with the introduction of the new endpoint (/api/v2/subnet/) we have cases where the id passed in such api calls to the replica does not always represent a canister anymore. So, the switch was made to principal id and wherever it's applicable we additionally check whether this is really supposed to be a canister id to proceed with further processing (e.g. in query or update calls or the existing canister state read but for example not in the new one). In hindsight, it should have probably been mentioned as I realise now that it might not have been super clear without more context.

The last part around the message for the two condition is something that was simply moved around in the commit, so kept the message intact. I can bring it up with the code owners to make a change if they agree.

Hey @stefan-kaestle and @dsarlis thank you so much for the feedback and interaction!  Keep up the good work.
