The [ic-protobuf](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/protobuf) contains protobuf messages used by the Replica. But I don't know how to get the protobuf messages like **registry**.  does anyone can give me a example?

We've talked some about a protobuf library for motoko, but the general consensus has been to migrate toward candid and add candid interfaces for the few protobuf functions that are out there.  I don't understand the slowness in adding these endpoints, but hopefully they are coming soon.  The big outstanding ones that I know about are:

Ledger
-getting Block detail
-getting archive index

Ledger Archive
-getting Block detail

Governance
-getting the XDR ratio
