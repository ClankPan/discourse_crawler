I think the service worker loading/splash page for IC hosted sites is a missed opportunity for a really cool loading IC/Dfiniity animation / splash. From the perspective of someone not privy to the IC, it could seem like an error page.

Thanks for the suggestion @Agent2222 , there is another [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-change-service-worker-loading-page/16104/22) where this has been discussed in the past and there are some suggestions for the loading page. 

I'll bring this up with the team again and see where we stand on this topic.
