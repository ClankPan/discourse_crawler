i use non-default identity for my project.  i able to find pem file for default identity under 
/Users/dctech/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem

but no pem file for any non-default identity
e.g.  i created one identity dctech
there are only identity.json & wallets.json  two files under /Users/dctech/.config/dfx/identity/dctech 
the identity.json file looks like
{
  "hsm": null,
  "encryption": null,
  "keyring_identity_suffix": "dctech"
}

is identity.pem file shared across all identities?

You need to execute 

`dfx identity export identity-name` for the pem

`dfx identity export alice >generated-id.pem` to store it
