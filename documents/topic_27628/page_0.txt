# aVa Reputation 0.9.1-beta: Add reputation to education diplomas and event attendance badges

## Project Highlights

The upcoming 0.9.1-beta release of the aVa Reputation System introduces an innovative MVP designed to change the way achievements and reputations are managed online. 
aVa Reputation is tailored for a wide range of users, especially in the education and events sector, including:
- **Graduates** of online courses and schools seeking tangible recognition for their achievements.
- **Event attendees** seeking a credible record of their attendance and participation.
- Organizations and institutions that need a reliable, transparent system for awarding and managing reputation and achievement.
- **Projects** and teams that earn a reputation can increase their project valuation.

### Problem Being Solved
aVa tackles the pressing issue of the absence of a transparent, decentralized, and verifiable system for recognizing and managing reputations and achievements.
This challenge is particularly prevalent in the digital realm, where traditional methods fall short in providing the necessary credibility and validation for online accomplishments.

## Features
- Custom implementation of ICRC-7 standard for doctokens, adaptable for developer-specific needs.
- Integration with Event Hub and aVa Reputation system for seamless badge issuance and management.
- Support for the Internet Computer's reverse gas model, ensuring efficient transaction processing.
- Designed to serve educational and event sectors, enhancing digital recognition and credibility.

## How to Install
The installation process for the aVa Reputation system involves several steps to ensure proper deployment and functionality:
1. **Repository Fork and Clone**: Begin by forking the [aVa Doctoken repository](https://github.com/ava-vs/doctoken) on GitHub and cloning it to your local machine.
2. **Customization**: Edit the `/commands/deploy-ic.sh` file within your fork to tailor parameters such as Name, Symbol, and Description to meet your specific needs.
3. **Launch Doctoken Canister**: Execute the `deploy-ic.sh` script located in the `commands` directory to deploy the Doctoken canister on the Internet Computer. This step requires an installed dfx and a funded wallet for transaction processing.

## Documentation
See [aVa Wiki](https://github.com/ava-vs/reputation/wiki) and doctoken [README](https://github.com/ava-vs/doctoken/blob/master/README.md) file.

## Dependencies
- Requires dfx for deployment.
- Compatibility with the Event Hub for event management and notification.
- Sufficient cycles for handling transactions, adhering to IC's reverse gas model.

Hi @ilialor 
Sorry that I missed your presentation yesterday.
We have added a certificate and diploma process within Jobgrader (https://jobgrader.app/ai) to issue verifiable credentials based on a diploma issuer with a smart agent and a decentralized Identity. 
We thought about adding NFTs, but have scheduled it for now.

Maybe we can add your NFTs into our Jobgrader Wallet.
