# Goal
To start a discussion that helps identify potential issues with the "wait and see" approach related to the upcoming change removing canister-controlled neuron restrictions.

# Why Canister Controlled Neuron Restrictions Exist

Restricting canisters from controlling neurons was an intentional security measure put in place at genesis, intended to **discourage a 51% attack** by making it extremely difficult to trade staked voting power.

Currently, HTTP outcalls + threshold ECDSA (introduced post-genesis) enable the ability for canisters to controlled neurons and identities, although the barrier for implementing a canister controlled neuron is higher than if this restriction were removed for canisters.


On May 6th, 2021, DFINITY wrote about **51% attacks**: [Source](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8#0704)
> <h2>51% Attacks on Governance</h2> <br/> A key security concern is the prevention of an attacker gaining 51 percent of the voting power, or even just enough that they can tip the balance in favor of those who vote unwisely, which will damage the success of the network. (The term “attacker” here applies equally to an actor who wishes to harm the network, an actor whose influence will be malign by accident, and one that might simply excessively centralize power.) Luckily, all things being equal, the colossal value of ICP locked inside the NNS makes it exorbitantly expensive to acquire such a stake. Furthermore, the financial investment required would be difficult to recoup, since ICP that have been purchased and locked would dramatically lose value if the network were harmed. <b>Even if resources were less of a concern — for example, where an attacker was a malign state actor — unlocked ICP could not be purchased quickly on financial exchanges, since the vast majority of the overall ICP supply is locked in neurons to earn rewards.</b> This would force such an attacker to build up their position slowly over time, with the buy pressure created by significant purchasing also driving up the price, such that successive purchases become ever more expensive. <br/> <br/>For these reasons, it is not likely to be possible to accumulate 51 percent of the voting power without gaining access to locked ICP balances. <b>This reflects why it is important that markets cannot be created for neurons. In this case, an attacker might seek to create a market panic in order that they can quickly acquire locked stakes en masse at low cost.</b> For example, they might combine a serious and sustained DoS attack on the network with the widespread dissemination of fake news and negative opinion on social media, to convince neuron owners that their locked stakes are at risk of becoming worthless such that a grand “fire sale” occurs. Although it is highly unlikely that a state actor would conduct such an attack in practice, the politics of open networks and digital assets ensure that mass manias and market crashes are far more possible. It is not in the interests of the network that such an event drives reorganization of voting power, especially where that results in its sudden centralization within a few well-financed hands. <b>This further reflects why markets for neurons would be undesirable.</b>


# The Current Plan to Remove Restrictions on Canister Controlled Neurons

### Suggested Way Forward

Acknowledging the potential for circumvention of the current mechanism, it is recommended to lift the restrictions on canister neuron control while monitoring the materiality of canister-controlled neurons, via the following steps:

* Lift restrictions on neuron control: Remove existing restrictions, allowing canisters to control NNS neurons.
* Implement new metrics: Develop and implement metrics in the NNS governance canister that track the total stake and voting power of canister-controlled neurons on a daily basis. This should include the proportion of canister-controlled voting power relative to the total voting power.
* Establish a materiality threshold: Set a threshold that triggers mitigation measures if canister-controlled neurons exceed 10% of the total voting power. ~~Neurons controlled by DAOs are exempt from this threshold.~~ The threshold might be adjusted at a later point in time. *For example, the threshold might be increased (upon NNS approval) following a materiality analysis of canister-controlled neurons belonging to DAOs, which are not considered to be an issue.*
* Delayed implementation of additional measures: Additional disincentives for neuron transfers will be implemented if the materiality threshold is surpassed. While further measures could enhance security, they would also increase complexity for users and require significant implementation effort. The specifics of these mitigation measures can be determined as the situation evolves and will be subject to a separate motion proposal. For instance, these disincentives would reduce the rewards for transferable neurons created after this proposal is passed; to avoid the reduction, non-transferability of neurons could be shown via a proof of knowledge of a cryptographic key controlling the neuron.

First off, I appreciate the effort and thought that went into bringing this idea to the community @bjoernek.

That being said, I fundamentally disagree that removing canister controlled neuron restrictions, with only metrics, a threshold, and no strong contingency/implementation plan in place.

Once a new feature (or lack of a restriction) is present and people are using it, it becomes extremely hard to deprecate or remove without angering the community. (As an example, [look at the recent attempt to lower the max VP from 8 years to 5 years](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/possible-optimizations-of-nns-tokenomics-updated/30352)).

Creating transferrable, canister controlled neurons opens up an easier developer implementation and customer UX for trading staked voting power, especially when compared to creating neurons inside of a tradable identity in the NNS dapp or any other currently available neuron trading approach.

Therefore, **it's not a matter of if, but when** we'll see larger amounts of voting power controlled by canisters, with dapps, interfaces, and ICRC standards built specifically for canister-controlled, tradable neurons.

If users are staking their ICP for 8-years in canister controlled, tradable neurons and that VP is compounding, how will the protocol prevent additional canister-controlled neuron VP from accruing if it passes 10% of the total VP.

Imagine what the backlash from the ICP community would look like at that point, which already staunchly comes to the defense of identity trading solutions such as [idgeek.app](https://xdtth-dyaaa-aaaah-qc73q-cai.raw.icp0.io). And this is only with >190k ICP having been transacted thus far on idgeek. 10% of overall VP would be a significantly larger cohort.

**Implementing mitigation measures at that point would be too late.** Those who have staked ICP in the NNS have shown that long-term ICP holders prioritize short-term rewards over the security of the network. This change will inflate the amount ICP staked in the NNS, and may unintentionally and irreversibly flip long & short-term voting incentives on their head, where the majority of long term holders have a short-term mind set and are only concerned with one thing - APY return.

In fact, the same [article written by DFINITY in 2021](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8#0704), emphasized the intended impact of locked neurons on long-term voter behavior:
> Neuron holders are placed in a cryptoeconomic game, where they are incentivized to vote to adopt and reject proposals, or to configure neuron follows that cause them to vote automatically in a desirable way, according to what is most likely to <i>drive the value of the Internet Computer network over the long term</I> 

I believe neuron marketplaces are already impacting the staking behavior of ICP investors to stake for longer time periods, and that in anticipation of liquid staking options, this change in behavior will accelerate once canisters are able to control neurons.

Community polling reinforces this notion that [the ability to transfer staked ICP via an identity marketplace already makes it more likely that ICP investors will stake their ICP for long period of time](https://x.com/mythoughts_ic/status/1768794320214376783).

Without a tangible mitigation plan in place, there are far fewer reasons for anyone to start dissolving a **tradable** 8-year neuron, as its liquidity and age bonus provides considerable value. There is also far little reason to stake a neuron for anything less than 8 years.

# Conclusion

I'm concerned with the ambiguity and lack of concrete ideas past removing the restriction on canister controlled neurons.

I’m still confused what happens in this case if there are no mitigations approved. Would the triggered event result in no action being taken until an approved mitigation is implemented?
[/quote]

**Short answer:** Yes, if you’re referring only to the final implementation as the action.

**Long answer:** The term “actions” can be interpreted broadly. In this context, it includes restarting discussions on this topic in the forum and developing concrete implementation proposals. However, actual implementation and the release of any mitigation measures, such as reducing rewards for transferable neurons, would require governance approval. Important is to note, that we already formulate the intent that something should be done once canister-controlled neurons become material.

There are a number of long-term investors and builders such as @dfisher and @skilesare that feel strongly about [having a mechanism for restrictions on neuron transfer in place](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597/154), and that removing neuron transfer restrictions both undermines both their investments and the [security of the network](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597/25).

DFINITY is extremely methodical about its improvements to the protocol, and in general one of the foundation's strengths is its planning and engineering attention to security.

Regardless of the outcome, I hope this thread sparks some additional discussion and crypto economic analysis on the potential outcomes that may arise by allowing canisters to control neurons.

Well said @justmythoughts.  I share your concerns.  I'd prefer to see a mitigation strategy fleshed out and implemented before neuron control restrictions are lifted for canisters.

With tECDSA + HTTPs outcalls you can already canister-control a neuron, this restriction makes no sense anymore.

I think we should just not let any neuron marketplace become too big. And as old-neurons cannot be transferred they won't be sellable on these marketplaces anyways (apart from selling identities).

Hi @justmythoughts 
Thank you for sharing your concerns. I would like to clarify the discussion on neuron control restrictions: The thread you referred to ([forum link](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597)) initially proposed a concrete idea: to differentiate between canister-controlled and non-canister-controlled neurons by introducing a scheme to identify each type and offering higher rewards to non-canister-controlled neurons. 

Implementing this idea would involve significant effort and add complexity for users. After considering community feedback, it was decided to explore a monitoring approach instead, waiting for further actions until the materiality of canister controlled neurons would surpass a relatively low threshold of 10% 

Therefore, I disagree with your view that there are no concrete ideas being considered. Rather, it was a conscious choice to delay potential implementations until the issue becomes more material. That said, I am still very much interested in hearing if you or others in this thread have alternative ideas for mitigations measures.
