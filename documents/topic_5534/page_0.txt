Hey,
I have just tried the Pub/sub example out ([https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/pub-sub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/pub-sub)). The docs say "PubSub is an especially valuable pattern on the Internet Computer as its primary drawback, **message delivery failures, does not apply**." 

Why does message delivery failures not apply here to? Docs here [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#http-call-overview](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#http-call-overview) say that a message can be rejected by system or before the "received" state.

So one still need to check if the call in Pub/Sub scenario was rejected or not? 
And can the message in inter-canister communication be dropped before the "received" state ([https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#http-call-overview](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#http-call-overview)) or does it only apply to user-canister communication?
Can someone elaborate more on the **message delivery failures, does not apply** statement from the Pub/Sub example docs and if there are different message delivery guaranties between canister-canister and user-canister communication?

Thanks

I think the short answer is that the statement in the example is probably misguided (i.e. wrong). Inter-canister messages, even oneway messages that don't return any response, can, as far as I know, still fail for many reasons (e.g. if the canister for a subscriber was deleted). @nomeata can you confirm?

(FWIW, the part of the spec you mention https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#http-call-overview is not entirely appropriate since it's talking about the http interface by which external agents communicate with the IC to sent "ingress" messages, not the internal, inter-canister communication that the pub-sub example is demonstrating)

Inter-canister messages cannot fail silently; you eventually either get a reply or a reject. A reject could be due to problems like “destination canister deleted” or “destination out of cycles” or messaging-related issues like “queue full”.
