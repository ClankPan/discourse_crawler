I have to say, I'm a little dishearted by the crypto space. I thought this bullrun could be different, but once again it's just memes, shitcoins and casino mentality. The chain with the most pump and dump influencers wins.

Crypto has yet to find its use in the real world. When I discovered the Internet Computer, it was the first time I ever saw a glance of how crypto could come into our lives. And I finally truly realized what Web3 means.

This is nice and all - and I know every one is asking to be patient, that there's a 20-year roadmap, that technology will prevail - but I'm terrified of the "Build it, they will come" mentality. I've experienced that in the past, where great projects end up failing because the interest just fades away, years after years, because even though the vision/tech are awesome, not everyone has the luxury and faith to wait for 20 years.

I want the short-term profits without having to invest in something I don't believe in (Sol, casino-meme-shitcoins).

Hence why I'm creating this thread. Maybe we can come up, as a community, with ways to make ICP shine today.

**List below your idea to put ICP in the spotlight.**

I'll start..

(Please 1 idea, 1 post)

ICP isn't good at memecoins; it should embrace its differences and succeed in its own way. Maybe UTOPIA will save us all, but I have no info on that, so let's do without.

One of the main narratives of ICP is "fully onchain". I've noticed some projects starting to pretend they're "the decentralized AWS of crypto" ([Avalanche](https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1765481899072307560), Polkadot,...). Let's remind them that ICP is king in this category (which will be imho one of the pillars of web3).

Maybe we could build a **dead-simple html page** which displays:

* N users have displayed this page in the last hour.
* Proof of hosting (frontend and backend)
* Proof of cost

Then we relay that to other chain communities on X and other media and challenge them to do better.

If ICP is half of what it says it is, then we should be able to crush them.

ICP is like a one-stop shop.  You don't need oracles, you don't need bridges, and most importantly, you don't need centralized servers, like AWS.  ICP is the most self-sufficient crypto project out there.

I'm sorry but can you provide an idea? 

Or you mean to say no additional marketing is required? ðŸ˜…

Some marketing can always help, but at the end of the day you need good products.

I think ICP is already doing good with some of the basic things that would attract more liquidity, such as, having dex swaps.  Being able to integrate with Bitcoin and Eth (and soon Solana) via multi-chain interoperability is huge.  But the main selling point has been about everything being "ON CHAIN".  I think that's a play more on ICP infrastructure.  And that by itself should make ICP shine in the crypto space.  

 But to really get the masses to take notice, I think they have to go beyond infrastructure and start developing in-demand read-to-use **products**, such as dapps and other solutions that showcase their tech/infrastructure.  Recent announcements from Dominic shows that they are doing that this year with UTOPIA, Ai, wallets with Ai, DocuTrack, etc.
