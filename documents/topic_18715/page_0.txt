When I try using the query_blocks function on my backend canister, there is nothing returned to me for the operation, nor is there a certificate. When I use the exact same information on the internet computer dashboard, all of the expected information is returned.

When you try to compare, you are trying with your canister deployed on mainnet/prod as well right?

Yes, this is being done on mainet.

Ha I think I have an idea. I may have had the same issue before I launched Juno.

Which version of the ic ledger cdk (`ic-ledger-types`) crate are you using?

If not last or before last it might be the reason. Try to upgrade it. There were some new variants that were added to the ledger and needs an up-to-date crate.
