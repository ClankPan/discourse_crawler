Given that Next.js is frontend-centric and the IC supports Rust, Azle, Motoko, and Kybra for backend logic, incorporating Next.js into `dfx` could bridge the gap between frontend and backend development on the IC. This would cater to projects that prefer Next.js's robust frontend capabilities alongside the powerful backend canister implementations of the IC.

Would this be a feasible enhancement for `dfx`?

@kpeacock how hard do you think it would be to add next.js to the default templates?

This would be supremely useful

Not terribly. It's just a matter of running `create-next-app` and then re-using the `dfx` React frontend with it
