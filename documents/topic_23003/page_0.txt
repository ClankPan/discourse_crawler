These were the PRs to support it, but I closed it because the official team thought the dependence on candid would cause problems(They got a very painful 0.8 -> 0.9 candid upgrade recently). I was wondering if community developers would like `Principal` and `Nat` to support `Storable` by default, and are willing to solve the dependency upgrade problem of candid by yourself? or do you prefer to remove the dependency of candid (of course, this also means that stable structure cannot provide Storable by default for Principal and Nat) implementation).

Please leave your comments. Any comments will affect whether these PRs are considered to be opened again.
