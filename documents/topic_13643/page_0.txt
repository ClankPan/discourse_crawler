I did it.  I created a static HTML website that is hosted out there in the wild on the Internet Computer.  I'm comfortable updating it, viewing it, and sharing the link to it.  Now, I want to look at the log files.  I want to see which IP addresses have looked at it.  I want to see which IPs have attacked it, and any other metric we can see from the current world deployment of a site using NGINX or Apache on a Linux server.  

I've gone through each line of the dfx documentation.  Nothing seems to give me 'log-like' feedback on how my site is doing out there.  Is there something I haven't seen in the Rust api/Motoko docs that could give me such feedback?  Surely the Dfinity developers have a way to dig deep into any canister, and to monitor traffic to and from any canister.  Is there a way for the canister owner to do it?  How can I view the equivalent of a server log file for a canister I created and am currently paying for?

I think a lot of people are using canistergeek or rolling their own solution.
