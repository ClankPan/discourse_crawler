Okay so Iâ€™m writing a .js script to call certain functions of a canister that require me to have certain permissions (caller must be a certain principal).

```
const canisterId = "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai";
const host = "http://localhost:8000/";
    const agent = new HttpAgent({ host });
    agent.fetchRootKey();
    const actor = Actor.createActor(someIDL, {
      agent,
      canisterId: canisterId,
    });    
    await (actor as any).callFunctionThatOnlyOwnerCanAccess();
```

I have the private key of the identity. Can I import that and create an Identity object or something?

Unfortunately, I have no information about importing keys. 
But you can login through Internet Identity canister and pass `identity` to `HttpAgent` to make user-authorized call.
And you need to deploy internet identity canister to local replica
