### Good day everyone!

I think I've run into the bug with dfx env generation: when you create new dfx project with "dfx new {project name}" using Motoko and include Internet Identity as an extra feature, if you remove this part from dfx.json "canisters" section:
```
"internet_identity": {
      "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity.did",
      "frontend": {},
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
        }
      },
      "type": "custom",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity_dev.wasm.gz"
    }
```
Then the project stops generating/updating env at all when you deploy or build your canisters. 

Shouldn't it just remove the II canister from the list of canisters? When I add it back it back, dfx behaves normally again. There are no errors or warnings, the canisters are deploying successfully on the local network, but the env is not updated/created.

using dfx 0.21.0
