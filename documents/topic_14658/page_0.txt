Hi everyone.
Come As You Are Team is proud to present Motoko Framework project.
As a 1-st phase of the project, we created CLI that should speed up the development process for Motoko developers.
 The main goal of this CLI is to install all necessary tools and also deploy a project to start development in a couple of commands.
At the current stage, it can install dfx and vessel and set up a couple of Motoko + react templates (clean, + Internet Identity support, + Plug support, + stoic support). Internet identity will be installed in a separate folder as part of the template with II support. Also as an option, you can install a ledger canister.
If you are interested, please have a look at the documentation here: [https://mofram.xyz/](https://mofram.xyz/)
Of course, it’s still WIP, so some new features and templates will be added soon.
If you have any suggestions, please don’t hesitate to share them with us.
We are looking forward to your feedback!
