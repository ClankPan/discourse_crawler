Hello my fellow Dfinians... 
Welcome to the Dfinity Discourse community! 

I'm Gregory, a Creative from London. 
My journey with Dfinify began nearly two years ago. Whilst the whitepaper captured my imagination, it was really the admin team and community that earnt my admiration... I can't remember how many questions I asked, but there was always answers and help available. It's this combination of vision, tech and community that made Dfinity the logical canvas for me. 

> If a project is only as good as it's community, then Dfinity must be great!

On that note, please take moment to familiarize yourself with the Discourse bot @discobot - it'll help you learn the ropes quickly! ðŸ˜Ž  

Now that the Dfinity SDK Alpha has been released, I'm looking forward to getting to know other members of community and discovering the projects they're working on. *So feel free to say hi!*

As for me, I'm currently focused on *Countersigner*, a decentralized financial ecosystem. 
Although, I'm sure to make time to be creative!
