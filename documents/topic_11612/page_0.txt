I'm trying to send cycles to my main.mo file. To do that, i need the canister-id to the canister defined in the main.mo file. where can i find that canister-id? is the canister-id that appears in the canister_ids.json file the canister-d for the main.mo file specifically?

Main.mo usually is the entry point for your canisters, but a better way to identify your canisters is your dfx.json, in your dfx.json you will find your canisters by name and you should see the entry point for that particular canister and then look in your canister_ids.json where there's a mapping to canister ids by name.
