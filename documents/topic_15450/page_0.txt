I dont know what it is this time, but it's not the first time this happens.

Could you try to refresh the page, and/or restart your browser and clear your cache and let us know if this resolved the issue? It might be caused by a recent app update.

This won't have any effects.

Don't think so. I think the problem is rather linked to the fact that the boundary nodes has some trouble today.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-09-15 21:07:50 UTC | #4

Thank you for the reply. 

I had already done that. Multiple times refreshing  Inc clearing my cache but no result. 
I do think this is a underlaying problem somewhere.. 
In the meantime it worked already, half of hour after posting this topic the NNS loaded correctly again. 

I cant define what the problem was, but like i said it was not the first time this happend. 
And i am daily using the NNS sinds may 2021. So i can tell you this honest over that timeframe its is not the first time.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-15 21:11:01 UTC | #5

I had this problem this morning.  One of the nodes is way behind and if you keep getting routed to it it won't load.  Likely if you check the consol you'll see that the certificate is out of date.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-16 05:03:34 UTC | #6

I can still reproduce it and reported it to the team.

It doesn't work for me i just tried it today... all this new UX is screwing up NNS . Didn't have this issue before (last login 1-2 weeks ago with old UX)

Edit: after my complain post i go ahead and try it once again and this time it works

-------------------------

Tony89 | 2022-09-18 12:59:50 UTC | #8

yes NNS is loading very slow.  doesn't even show up causing discomfort when logging in.  hope to fix it soon‚Ä¶SOS @peterparker

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-18 13:16:12 UTC | #9

Thanks for pinging me @Tony89 ! I / we are aware of it. @diegop also got the same report today. I shared the info on the internal Slack channel and tagged some colleagues to move things forward. Hope there will be soone a solution and will update the thread accordingly.

-------------------------

NFHX | 2022-09-18 14:10:09 UTC | #10

Same problem here for a few days now.
I either get a gray screen or an infinite loading icon.

It also affects II for me and sometimes makes me unable to log in to other apps.

Fix for me right now is trying over and over again.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-09-18 15:47:26 UTC | #11

18/09/2022 17:40 pm : Same problem appeared again... 

It doesn't load : 
- Accounts
- Voting
- Neurons

It's becoming problematic, i request a fix Asap.

-------------------------

anonymous | 2022-09-18 18:28:45 UTC | #12

Had been experiencing issues here as well.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-18 18:48:24 UTC | #13

Same here, only the voting tab works.

-------------------------

janman1970 | 2022-09-18 19:16:54 UTC | #14

I logged in today and couldn't get Neurons to load. Went to Voting but when clicking on a proposal, it never got past the eternal spinning loader. Logged out then logged back in and everything seemed to work.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-09-18 19:23:52 UTC | #15

Well done people, well done ! üòÜ

Second time this week ive seen this...

Thanks for the feedback everybody! We don't like it neither, got some more feedback and it seems an issue with the "replica being behind" (don't got much concrete info).

This has for effect that sometimes asset resources - such as CSS - are not delivered (that's why in above screenshots it looks super ugly empty) and sometimes read query or update calls don't succeed (that's why NNS-dapp gives sometimes the feeling to be stuck).

I come back with fresh news as soon as I hear anything.

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-09-18 19:37:59 UTC | #17

Bussines wise seen, this can not be. With all do respect ofcours, but it's becoming very amature. 
After all this months, is it not time shit starts to work a little bit like it should? üòú

-------------------------

tcpim | 2022-09-18 21:19:26 UTC | #18

Happened to me as well. Been very slow and most times cannot load recently

-------------------------

tcpim | 2022-09-18 21:27:59 UTC | #19

When clicking the "Account" or "Neurons" tab, page doesn't load. Web console says error `main-19827f64.js:1 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://nns.ic0.app/build/Accounts...`

-------------------------

l0st0 | 2022-09-18 21:38:06 UTC | #20

Seems to be finally fixed :slight_smile:

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-09-19 01:46:50 UTC | #21

It‚Äôs still very slow for me and sometimes I‚Äôm unable to authenticate.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-19 05:44:06 UTC | #22

So, some updates: The suspicion is one of the NNS nodes running far behind, slowing down the subnet on finalization. There are 2 steps to resolve the issue:

* Remove the problematic node with proposal (üëâ [#81002](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/81002))
* Update boundary node config to avoid routing to the problematic node

While both steps are necessary, the 1st step is critical to restore service speed.  The 2nd step has been executed but the proposal is not executed yet.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-09-19 08:01:24 UTC | #23

And we are stuck on voting YES because some of us still cannot access NNS to vote?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-19 08:08:22 UTC | #24

With command line it is still possible to vote.

Last update: 

- Above mentionned proposal [#81002](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/81002) has been executed now but, its status is not reflected in the dashboard.

- In addition to what I say above, it actually needs an additional proposal [#81403](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/81403) to remove the problematic node I understand

Once this last proposition executed, will need some checks to see if finally bring everything back in place.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-09-19 08:19:44 UTC | #25

The voting result as of 09-19-2022 5:04AM UTC was 0.473% Yes and 0.006%No.  

![Screenshot_20220919-011611_Chrome|243x500](upload://1afMPtKXLCNt9SvmvCIvi7Vd5NA.jpeg)
 How did the proposal get executed? Should the dashboard be not trusted?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-19 08:21:05 UTC | #26

Like I said in my above message, the status in the dashboard is **not** reflected - i.e. is not up-to-date.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-09-19 08:29:53 UTC | #27

[#81403](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/81403) has been executed and performance should be improved **now**!

Let me know if that works for you?

-------------------------

Jacobs.ic | 2022-09-19 08:47:57 UTC | #28

Yes sir, 

we are back in action. 

Hopefully it can be maintaind to operate. 

Thanks for the update üëç

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-09-19 08:56:31 UTC | #29

Looks fine from my side, too.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-09-19 12:34:45 UTC | #30

My understanding is that node providers cannot currently be slashed due to the contracts originally put in place(I understand this was necessary to bootstrap).  What is the long-term thinking about this?  We shouldn't have had to take this action if the node providers were properly incentivized to make sure their nodes kept up.

-------------------------

Azat | 2022-09-19 17:36:14 UTC | #31

I think there should be quarantine.
If the monitoring system detects a failure on a node, then it moves the node to quarantine for a certain time (depending on the type of failure).
The time spent in quarantine is then subtracted from the node's reward.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-19 17:44:31 UTC | #32

afaik there is no form of slashing planned, only removal from subnet and remuneration penalties.

-------------------------

ajstocks21 | 2024-01-10 00:45:43 UTC | #33

My nns just keeps loading and will not allow me access it. I have tried on multiple devices.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-01-10 05:53:28 UTC | #34

Hanging in NNS or hanging in II?

If NNS, issue will be resolved with the next version that was proposed.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/extra-nns-dapp-upgrade-to-fix-ios-15-issue/26366

If II, I'm not aware of an issue but someone mentionned something in another thread which was resolved.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/cant-log-into-nns-via-phone-or-laptop/26382/2?u=peterparker

-------------------------

ajstocks21 | 2024-01-10 07:40:22 UTC | #35

The link you provided did the same thing the issue is still not resolved for me

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-01-10 08:03:17 UTC | #36

The proposal has not yet been executed therefore the fix has not been yet rolled out.

-------------------------

Loopy | 2024-01-10 10:10:32 UTC | #37

Should of specified that logging into the NNS via computer worked for me after a few tries, still no luck with the phone.

I'm not aware of any issue on computer. The unreleased fix is specific for iOS 15.
