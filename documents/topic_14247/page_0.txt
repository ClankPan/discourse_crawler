Edit 7/13: @bjoernek and DFINITY have proposed to revert the governance proposal weights to 1 in order to remove the financial incentives for spamming the NNS. 

I commend their integrity in proposing this solution even though it is against their financial interests.

You can read the proposal forum post & discussion here https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275. 

You can view the NNS proposal at https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/70015

Original message below
—————


For all the “spam” talk a few months ago, we’ve all become unsettlingly accustomed to NNS spam.

There’s always going to be a “big feature” or “event” going on - from Supernova, to BTC integration, to SNS, HTTP requests, ICQC, Node Decentralization etc…

Until then it seems no one’s in a hurry to combat spam as long as we all get a bit fatter from the rewards. 

And why should they be in a hurry - **DFINITY is the single greatest individual profiteer of NNS spam rewards**. 

It’s embarrassing that a single individual is handsomely profiting from an IC spam business - maybe the VCs from Supernova should get involved. @ysyms is making far more from spam than any of the Supernova projects, and I’d bet that DFINITY is making more in ICP spam rewards than any project on the IC right now.

It makes sense that there has been no traction/movement in combating spam. Instead, the only NNS/governance related proposal that has seen traction recently was:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586

There was even a [sub proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586/151) within this thread that would result in giving 8-year stakers an even bigger cut of the rewards (even more incentive for whales to fund spam).

I personally believe that ignoring these types of rewards issues will make it much harder to decentralize the NNS, and will perpetually incentivize long-term ICP holders to look out just for their financial interests. All of these voters are voting specifically on proposals that will incentivize ICP holders to lock up even more tokens (artificially inflating the token price), and proposals that give even more voting/rewards rate to 8-year stakers. 

I understand bear markets are challenging, but I thought the long-term staking system was supposed to incentivize long-term thinking -  instead, I’ve only seen “how can we inflate the price of ICP and get more ICP rewards”.


Believe it or not, but lower, stable rewards are actually better for decentralization - shorter lockup and staking times give more liquidity, stability, and trust in ICP. **The majority of investors, developers, and exchanges do NOT want excessive volatility**.

In a lower NNS rewards yield/reward environment, there’s less speculation and people aren’t just staking to chase yields (like with stable coins), they are staking primarily to vote in the future of the project because of its tangible (not speculative) value. The tangible value of ICP is for voting/governance of the IC, and paying for compute (cycles) - NOT rewards farming (price speculation of ICP).


@diegop @bjoernek what’s the current status of DFINITY’s thoughts regarding proposals for tackling spam, and what’s a realistic timeline for an NNS proposal and completed implementation solving the spam issue?

I also don't understand why this problem of resolving Spam, abuse of this bonus is not noticed?  Is it because of the conflict of interest of the holders of the large number of ICPs?  they also benefit from voting on the spam proposal so try to prolong the time to benefit together?? It's sad when a whole collective can't do anything about a single borer.

I think the spam issue was blown out of proportion, its an issue that must be solved at some point but there were much more important topics that could have benefited from the same level of community engagement. 

Personally I see the current spam situation as a feature and not a bug as it gives active stakers a nice APY boost without increasing the yearly inflation and helps increasing Dfinity's treasury. The only negative aspect is ysms asking absurd amount of money to run the campaigns.

The title you picked for this post doesn’t accurately reflect the content.  It looks like you are trying to post a sensational news paper article in order to sell more papers.  Why attack the very organization that is needed to help implement a solution?

There has already been a [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) that passed that will completely solve this spam proposal issue.  I know you don’t favor that proposal, but you could try challenging why that proposal hasn’t been implemented yet.  It has features that go beyond spam prevention that are highly beneficial and important to long term governance, so it’s a feature that is needed even if the driver isn’t spam prevention.  All other spam prevention proposals that have surfaced in prior discussions are harder and more time consuming to implement.  Plus nobody ever took those discussions to the actual proposal stage, which means there is nothing to further consider. (edit: @skilesare did submit a [temporary proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56801) that was rejected)

Another way you can contribute to the solution you are seeking is to use the original tool that is already built into the governance system…make a proposal to increase the proposal reject fee.  Even if you don’t agree with that idea, it is an effective tool.  I know the community got all up in arms about the last increase because of the generalized perception that it censors that small guy who has the brilliant idea.  However, that guy will find a way because of their brilliance and a likely result is crowdfunding the proposal reject fee.  The higher the proposal reject fee, the more the incentive for a brilliant guy to sponsor a governance proposal because they get to keep the fee if it passes and it’s not their ICP if it doesn’t pass.  It also produces tangible community support for the proposal before it is made instead of just being influenced by the vocal minority on social media and forum posts.

Why not embrace the tools that are already available?  Why not embrace the proposal that has already passed that will solve this problem? 

This forum post feels like you want to make noise more than you want to solve the problem because you don’t recognize these solutions and you didn’t follow up on your prior attempts on a solution.  There will never be a solution that everyone in the community will like.  A proposer needs to do their best at leading deliberation on a proposal and eventually make decisions that they believe accurately reflect the community input while still remaining true to their original proposal goal, but eventually it’s all meaningless unless they go all in by putting the proposal to a vote.  If you want action, then take action.  Try to deliver something to the community and DFINITY that has verified governance support.

@wpb your response came off as partly an attack against me mixed with a rebuttal to my initial argument, so I've broken this response into two parts.

1. A bit of background on the spam topic, and my personal contributions thus far on this specific topic, and to the developer forums regarding other areas of the IC
2. Addressing your concerns with my post


### First off, a bit of background

[quote="wpb, post:4, topic:14247"]
This forum post feels like you want to make noise more than you want to solve the problem because you don’t recognize these solutions and you didn’t follow up on your prior attempts on a solution
[/quote]

I, and many others such as yourself, @skilesare, @lastmjs, etc. have spent countless hours coming up with proposals to combat spam in the forums, as well as addressing long threads of concerns/feedback. In fact, I started the [very first discussion](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915) in this forum related to spam prevention the first week spam started in early April. I later created two complementary proposals to combat the spam issue
1. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-fix-governance-proposal-rewards-at-75-on-a-daily-basis/12417
2. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-introduce-an-incubation-period-and-minimum-support-threshold-for-governance-proposals/12220)

My work on these proposals was incorporated and referenced in several other notable proposals brought forth by the developer community, which were picked up and evaluated by @bjoernek from DFINITY
1. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-restrict-rewards-qualification-to-a-threshold/12206 by @skilesare
2. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-covert-from-system-based-reward-to-voter-based-reward-to-implement-an-accept-quorum-mechanism-and-to-return-the-reject-cost-to-1-icp/12813 by @skilesare  
3. https://forum.dfinity.org/t/multi-stage-governance-proposals-starting-w-stage-0-and-stage-1/12534 by @lastmjs 

These proposals have stalled since early-mid May (the Supernova effect?)


[quote="wpb, post:4, topic:14247"]
There has already been a [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) that passed that will completely solve this spam proposal issue.
[/quote]

As you mentioned, [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) was passed back in April. It was put on the "roadmap", but is not at all difficult feature to design and implement from an engineering perspective. In fact, I would conservatively estimate that this would take something like 2 weeks of backend and 1 week of frontend engineering work tops to implement. It's actually possible the reason this proposal hasn't been implemented yet is because DFINITY is not in favor of it, or is waiting for another solution that they would prefer.

[quote="wpb, post:4, topic:14247"]

[/quote]

You know this is not accurate. @skilesare crowdfunded and put forth an easy-to-implement quick-fix https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-temporarily-reduce-governance-proposal-weight-to-1/12390, which was rejected. Had this proposal passed, it would have been much harder (20X harder) for whales to benefit financially from spam proposals through @ysyms.

[quote="wpb, post:4, topic:14247"]
Another way you can contribute to the solution you are seeking is to use the original tool that is already built into the governance system…make a proposal to increase the proposal reject fee.
[/quote]

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increase-proposal-rejection-cost/12110 did not achieve it's goal of reducing spam, as agreed by notable members of the community such as @LightningLad91

[Source](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increase-proposal-rejection-cost/12110/88)
[quote="LightningLad91, post:88, topic:12110"]
I want to acknowledge the points you make here @coteclaude. It’s evident to me now that increasing the spam proposal cost to 10 ICP is not an effective spam deterrent. Furthermore, any additional increase would only serve to further harm the average stakeholder. I clearly made bad assumptions about what people would be willing to do to increase their rewards.
[/quote]

The 10 ICP proposal reject cost has not stopped spam, it's acted as a blunt censor on new proposals that aren't financially funded (by crowdfunding or whales) being brought forth by the community to the NNS.

<br/>


### To address your concerns

[quote="wpb, post:4, topic:14247"]
The title you picked for this post doesn’t accurately reflect the content. It looks like you are trying to post a sensational news paper article in order to sell more papers. Why attack the very organization that is needed to help implement a solution?
[/quote]

I feel the title is actually very accurate. DFINITY **is** profiting from the NNS spam rewards more than any other staked entity. Although DFINITY has said they won’t work on the spam issue until after the SNS, the SNS release will most likely go through several stages of release and tuning (not just one and done) and I’d estimate it won’t be fully complete until 2023 at the earliest. 

I therefore see no reason why proposals to eliminate spam won't be kicked down the road(map) as long as possible, especially if the financial incentives to delay implementation are aligned with those that have the most voting power.

[quote="Zane, post:3, topic:14247"]
Personally I see the current spam situation as a feature and not a bug as it gives active stakers a nice APY boost without increasing the yearly inflation and helps increasing Dfinity’s treasury.
[/quote]

I’m glad some of us can see the current situation for what it is, and just have different opinions on whether this is positive or negative for the community.

> Why am I "sensationalizing" this?

I'm escalating my tone with respect to this specific issue of spam on the forums, because it now seems that the entire community has accepted spam as the new normal, and that no action or **even discussion** has taken place in the last month with respect to NNS spam (by the community or DFINITY), while the amount of spam has escalated in the meantime.

I don't vote actively anymore - not because I don't care about the IC and NNS, but because my NNS app is slow and my inbox is 95%+ spam. I'd estimate that I'm not the only one who's voting habits have changed over the past few months. 


> In the following statement denoted by (->), I'm extrapolating a bit based on my personal experience here (I don't have data to back this up)...

\-> To think all of these changes going back to last year were to incentivize active participation, and now we could **potentially** be back at a more passive governance state with voters checked out and delegating to their follow neuron all because of a spam issue that either no one wants to or has the time to tackle. A passive NNS, with 4 voting named neurons and everyone default following them.

<br/>

Prioritization comes from visibility and sometimes shining a light on a glaring issue is the best way to drive action and improve it. Management drives priorities, which can be easily changed - for example, DFINITY is currently prioritizing and investing a significant amount of financial resources into two lawsuits
1. https://cointelegraph.com/news/dfinity-foundation-files-lawsuit-against-meta-over-infinity-logo (this is PR)
2. [Defamation lawsuit against NYT and Arkham Intel](https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1542853414723411969) - (100% agree with this lawsuit)

The resources for the logo lawsuit could have easily instead been spent on an engineer or two (at least) to design and implement [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651), or a different a solution for NNS spam.

Outside of NNS spam, I’ve dug into other issues and brought visibility to them such as
* https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-process-does-the-dfinity-foundation-use-to-vote-on-nns-proposals/11385
* [decentralization of the boundary nodes](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/6-8-22-s-multi-continent-ic-outage-are-boundary-nodes-the-top-attack-vector-for-the-ic/13624)
* https://forum.dfinity.org/t/a-case-study-on-the-benefits-of-passive-voting-power-through-default-followees/12808?u=justmythoughts

in order to get more information and drive action where necessary. We all benefit when the IC receives criticism, and as both a developer and investor, I care deeply about these issues as they will have long-term effects on the IC (even if I am benefiting handsomely from the current rewards structure).


[quote="wpb, post:4, topic:14247"]
I know you don’t favor that proposal, but you could try challenging why that proposal hasn’t been implemented yet.
[/quote]

Outside of good faith, how the work for the NNS proposals that have passed will eventually be implemented and shipped to the IC is a great question for another forum topic thread (Is it DFINITY's responsibility? Should the community given a pair of keys to the castle?). 

Remember this proposal that passed the NNS? -> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-request-for-neuron-indexing/11183

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-07-10 23:27:48 UTC | #6

FWIW - I'm glad you are escalating this; I agree with many of your points. I wish you luck trying to break through to someone.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-07-11 00:18:35 UTC | #7

I used a stronger tone because I highly respect you as a contributor to these governance topics and I want to motivate you (and others) to turn your ideas into something that is actionable for the governing body to decide.  All ideas are debatable as you have referenced extensively, but none of them will ever bear fruit unless they are presented to the NNS for voting.  Please give DFINITY something concrete to put on the roadmap so everyone (DFINITY and the community) can stay focused on ideas the governing body approves and we can move on or iterate ideas when the governing body rejects.

I edited my post to give @skilesare credit for the temporary proposal that he did submit.  Thanks for calling me out on that detail.

Of course a proposal reject fee of 10 ICP will not be effective.  That's an insufficient fee by far.

I agree DFINITY is profiting from the spam proposals...just like everyone else who is voting.  That was one point out of many that you made in your post and it wasn't even the main point, yet you chose to lead with that in the title.  I would argue that a more accurate title would be something like "Why has deliberation stalled on ideas to resolve the spam proposal issue?" since that is a more accurate reflection of the content of your post.

I very much agree with your point that governance voting has become too routine and I would like to see the spam issue resolved sooner than later by implementing the proposals that have passed.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-11 02:18:41 UTC | #8

We are all 100% against spam.  This is not the question.  But, to me, those spams also are a solution to something I consider a problem, or something not fair let's say.  And it is about Active and Non-Active voters.  These spams are taking rewards from non active accounts and reward the active accounts.  Talking about those who are here on the forum, read and/or participate.  At least active enough to configure their neurons to follow a voting neuron.
Some non active neurons are from people who don't care obviously, not even care enough to understand and configure their neurons correctly.  And even worst, rewards given forever to a dead owner account or a lost accounts.  Of course I am in high favor of the proposal 55651 to confirm your neurons following.  This is the minimum we can do and should be highly prioritize TMO.
Then, I would not see reasons for anyone to create spams.
Maybe not a popular opinion, but for me, now, those spams are more a temporary solution then a problem until proposal 55651 is implemented.
Edit:  This is in line with the logic of many owners that ICP locked in NNS are governance token, and NNS is not a passive staking system.

Not sure if this will be useful, but **until the already approved fix ([proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)) is implemented**, I'd suggest to
[quote="plsak, post:15, topic:12532"]
**rename `spam proposals` to `keepalive proposals`** and discuss with the author (@ysyms) how to use it better for the community (**if he/she is willing to**) - it’s sponsored anyways so why not to use it as general and legit `governance` proposals channel
[/quote]

For example, anyone who would want to submit a `governance` proposal could prepare an MD file with it and upload it to some agreed location, @ysyms could then submit it instead of the `M.DD-test` ones (if is fine with that).

Plus, as people might get pretty `creative`, it might also speed up implementation of the

There is an extremely simple way to decentralize ICP:

 **Let every member of DFINITY and ICA be elected periodically by the NNS.**

I really wonder why that does not happen. Could anyone explain this to me?

It seems to be the final form of decentralization of any public blockchain with POS.

Sormarler | 2022-07-12 04:45:49 UTC | #15

That's like HBAR type of governance. I don't think this is a great idea. The current set is fine. We just need more named neurons, a lot more of them.

Here we go again, all those who didn’t oppose the spam just to collect the rewards are here for selfish needs.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:1, topic:14247"]
Until then it seems no one’s in a hurry to combat spam as long as we all get a bit fatter from the rewards.
[/quote]

The only proposal that came out to combat spam was a 6 month timer to re-follow those who are not active and then collect their rewards for themselves.

These are the same old’s who are very protective of the spam for the rewards spam by @ysyms.

While those in our Governance community claim as they are active they deserve the rewards of the followers don’t do anything but the above and contribute nothing to create and this is evident by having only team proposals on the NNS and you may just as well just follow. 

While I a follower did put up proposal ideas on Governance none of these opposers were active and gave a stuff.

So far as a newbie I have witnessed the selfish come out in force and got nothing good to contribute so don’t be surprised at the annoyance. 

Welcome to the active bystanders.

Hi all, a suggestion for a tactical fix on spam and reasoning why this is proposed now, it described [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275).

What do you think is preventing people from getting together to form more named neurons?

wpb | 2022-07-12 11:40:41 UTC | #19

If I am reading this post correctly, I think one of your points is that you often don't get responses to your posts.  I can't speak for others, but I will share with you the reasons why you often don't get a response from me.

1) I find it very difficult to understand what you are saying in many of your posts.  
2) A large fraction of your posts seem to have a condescending tone and you are almost always upset about something.
3) A lot of your claims when you appear to be criticizing others seem to be based on assumptions that you present as facts.

I would love to have intellectually honest conversations with you about a variety of these topics, but generally speaking I believe it would be unproductive since you have such an aggressive and critical tone and I don't always understand your points.  My sense is that if I try to engage with you it will not be a civilized conversation.

-------------------------

xpung | 2022-07-12 16:21:50 UTC | #20

Do you think an NNS proposal would be capable of a whiteboard coding test? Do you think anyone would voluntarily work somewhere where they get fired in a year if they fail a popularity contest?

dfinity just needs to vote on spam proposals every other day to bring average returns back to normal

If dfinity （or anyone else） wants this, please do

Alternative: Use only about 50% of voting power to vote on spam proposals

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-07-12 21:10:38 UTC | #22

Angry never, just don't like responding but I can see that a few here want to control in their favor and therefore I don't feel this is decentralised forum but more a mob driven by a few. Clearly all messages have a tone.

My assumptions have turn into knowing history from being involved with the Governance forums and seeing the facts as I hold to the claim that the 6 months timer for followers was nothing more than selfishness and should be revoked as everyone who is invested into ICP should have equal rewards and not centralised rewards. 

Calling people followers in a derogatory term when there is nothing to vote on but teams updates is not acceptable.

But in the future I will be less passionate and more clear and I appreciate your fee back.

[/quote]

I’m pretty sure I understand your point here.  I think you are saying that you believe that all stakers should be treated equally.  I agree with your point that the rules should apply equally to everyone.  I would argue that they do apply equally and programmatically to everyone.  

However, I suspect you are coming from the point of view that the rules should never change.  This is where I would disagree.  In my opinion, the governance system does not exist to pay people an investment return.  It exists to incentivize people to participate in governance in a way that we each individually believe is in our own long term best interest, which in aggregate will be in the long term best interest of the IC.  The decisions that need to be made for governance of the IC are subjective decisions, which inherently means we will not all agree.  The tokenomics are intended to encourage people to participate so that a maximum body of opinion can be heard via their vote.  It is not a perfect system yet, but it is moving in the right direction and it can only get better through change.  

The changes that have occurred in the past and that have been approved for future implementation (such as the 6 month re-confirmation of followees) have advanced decentralization and should continue moving us in that direction.  I think it’s a mischaracterization to claim that folks who support these changes are selfish.  I think we simply have a difference of opinion.  It’s ok if we agree to disagree.

This is an example of a point you made that I do not understand.  I can’t respond to this because no matter how I try to read it I cannot understand the message.  It’s not intended to be a criticism at all, just an example.

kusiyo | 2022-07-12 22:49:59 UTC | #24

I think you really missed the point.
If you are elected by NNS, then only NNS can fire you.
That actually empowers everyone in DFINITY and ICA.

kvic | 2022-07-12 22:56:30 UTC | #25

Some months back I read an article that there were concerns about dead people and the rewards they will keep receiving because they selected to follow these groups:

DFINITY Foundation, ICP Maximalist Network, Internet Computer Association, cycledao.xyz and ICDevs.org

It was suggested by a few that this was unfair and that followers who did not actively vote should not receive rewards because they could be dead.

My concern is that by changing the underlying API from under investors and their rights to be rewarded for following their rights may bring a class action to regain their benefits as would be their right.

But from a forum that is disconnected from the NNS and therefore not updating investors of the changes they would like to make to the NNS that in my opinion seems self rewarding and damming to NNS claim to be decentralized.

Are we behaving just like the Top Tech companies changing API’s from under there customers for self gain.

We need to remove the change made to the NNS to unfollow that which was followed by investors and inform the investor via the NNS so that all investors have been informed and not just change the underlying API without notice which is contemptible.

No one put forwards any decentralize options that I am aware of like to the NNS:

A notice that all following on the NNS will be terminated after a period if the investor wasn’t active in logging in or being able to add a NFT or another form of contact in case of an inactive period.

It seemed to me that it was justifiable that if an investor was not active in Governance then it gave further credibility that they should change the underlying API when the NNS does not inform investors that I am aware of on the NNS of the forum.

That the active voters on the disconnected forum should receive more rewards for being active.

Active on what:
Dog boys spam each day on the NNS to give rewards to active voters that were informed on the forums and not the NNS but vai facebook where you had organized spamming for active members known by everyone in this forum and unknown on the NNS.


I gave an idea about how to stop spam on the NNS just by punishing neurons that spam but not one support or change but as soon as you threaten the forum members from making changes to giving dead people their rights then they come out of the woodwork otherwise they are what I call Active Bystanders and those who will undermine this project and walk away with the rewards for their own interests and leave behind a bad reputation of a known spammers haven. 

I can assure you that I never once went to dog boys Facebook page to be notified of when the spam was being added to the NNS for the rewards but was active everyday and voted no, only when I saw his spam.

Can you not see that our behavior to allow active voters in allowing spammers to spam and inform us in the ICP forum and make changes to the NNS by the underlying API to disbenefit our own seems more of a dark website.


As for my tone in response to past comments that were made as passionate and well meaning to opposers that may bring harm to this forum and the NNS.

For this very reason I have become sensitive to the name Follower or uninformed as criticism.

I’m familiar with the article because I wrote it.  It’s the content of [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).  The point about dead people was a minor emphasis, yet an important point.  The concept applies equally to people who have locked themselves out of their internet identity by losing devices and not being responsible about storing their recovery phrase.  There are also people who were granted significant neurons at genesis who have never claimed them.  The point is that there are a lot of ways to be locked out of participation in governance, yet default configuration of neurons results in permanent following and permanent receipt of rewards that will never be claimed.  This is not appropriate in system that is designed to reward governance participation.  We get paid voting rewards for only one thing…voting participation.  It should require some minimum level of active participation, which was the main point of the proposal.

To be clear, the NNS is a mutable system.  No one who participates in ICP governance has ever been promised specific voting rewards and no contracts have ever been offered for staking with a promise that the rules will not change.  In fact, the whole point of the NNS is recognition that the code will need to change.  The NNS provides a fair and decentralized mechanism to enable change, including changes to the tokenomics that incentivize participation.  Hence, in my opinion, there is no standing for any court case filed as a result of the governing body for the NNS implementing a change.

@kvic 

Am I understanding you right when I think that your main issue is that the changes to the NNS Governance are not advertised well ahead of time on the NNS app itself instead of being announce on this forum or Reddit, Twitter or any other web page??

I grant you that you have a point as have I and this venue should be voting on the issues with the knowledge of all neuron owners but I am not sure that is the case. 

As for the assumption that we may not have a situation of a class action, I am reminded of reading such a case being brought against another decentralized coin and legal may not agree with you.

As for my view on future rewards, this project is not a project in my opinion that will offer great rewards as it is built for cycles and not like the top five coins.  

My interest is the project idea and Domonic vision.

I would prefer a different outcome to rectify your concerns as a realistic problem and my opinion which I have always been accused as a trouble maker for not following when I see another point of view and rewards come second which seem to be the driver for change and not fixing the issue.

Which is off topic I think of your concerns of this topic and I don't have any concerns with DFINITY being the greatest profiteer as this strengthened this project but I see your point that we should understand this and work to change this in the future but I certainly would not trust this to the Governance group that in my opinion have undermine us.

wow this clearly indicates voter fraud... or am I just exaggerating? are we seriously ignoring the fact that DFINITY and ICPMN's actions indicate collusion and voting fraud?
