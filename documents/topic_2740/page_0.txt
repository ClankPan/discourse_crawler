Hello. I'm seeking a way to view generated canister methods when importing a dependency canister via the `#[import]` macro from the `ic_cdk_macros` crate. This would be tremendously helpful in debugging. I haven't figured out a way to piece together what it's generating other than picking my way through the candid -> rs gen sourcecode from the macros crate.

Is there a way I can view this generated rs code?

enerated rs code?

Managed to get some expansion with this crate cargo-expand, but this doesnt expand the  imported canister unfortunately. 

```
rustup run nightly cargo expand  --package inter_rs --release
```
