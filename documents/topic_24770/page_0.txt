I just pushed candy_library to v0.3.0.

https://github.com/icdevsorg/candy_library

v0.3.0

- Added the ValueShared type for dumping a Candy and CandyShared to an ICRC3 style Value type.

- Added many tests.

Mostly this syncs up the ICRC16 schema as a comparable type to the Value type being used in ICRC3 and ICRC7 metadata.

It lets you store things in a stable(motoko stable) way that is internally set up to take advantage of Maps and Sets so that large, unstructured, recursive, and nested data sets are a bit more manageable.
