I have 13 neurons with the same number of ICPs each created in one day inside of one identity. For 3 months all 13 behaved the same. But the last 4th month produced  lesser amount of rewards in one of them.
I am puzzled  by this discrepancy.
......

That was just the beginning of this thread! As it turned out is has become more about absolute absence of concerns for safety of the members at his forum. So, read on!!!!

I have received a message from Sandeep1 to my mailbox with suggestion to contact Dfinity Support to speak with live agent with a link. I had a somewhat strange conversation with an agent who told me that there was a problem with my wallet because it was flagged as a dormant without a reason and I have to manually reset my wallet and started asking a lot of strange questions, like what is $ value of my wallet? In the middle of the conversation he just disappear, meaning stopped answering.
Could it be a nefarious play of sort?

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-15 22:24:46 UTC | #3

I received a second message to my postbox from a different person with a link to Support.
 I have made a second attempt to contact a live agent to solve the problem. 
After he tried to persuade me that: "Our system shows that you have an expected yield you are supposed to get normally." 

I objected: "How come that 12 neurons of the same size are getting 42.06 and one only 37.79? Where is the logic of it? Why the previous 3 months there was no such difference?" 

 It caused him to admit finally: "It is an error marked by our system. I’m running a scan now." 
Next he wrote: "Okay Great. We can only send you the difference as a new deposit
But it has to be sent to another wallet that you own."

Then he added: "You have to make a new deposit of ICP to your wallet. We will use the transaction hash to return your difference."

I asked: "Are you saying that I have to go to the Couibase and to buy some ICP?"

He answered: " Yes, You have to buy from coinbase between 125 - 500 ICP."  

I replied: "Your system is making an error but I have to buy iCP? Why don't you just make transfer of the amount caused by the error to my Ledger. I think it makes sense."

He answered: "Yes, It makes more sense this way.  But the system has also marked out the only solution and the ICP will be in your wallet. We only need the transaction hash to correct the wrongs."

I wrote: "To my understanding I can stake even 1 ICP. Why do you demand it to be between 125 - 500?"

His answer: "That is the threshold."

My reply: "The threshold for what? OK. Unfortunately I do not have extra money to buy those ICP right now. What are we going do in this case?" 

He answered: " It’s important that you purchase so we can complete the process that we started already."

I objected: "I cannot just make up extra money right now. I am not a magician. Am I to expect to same problem next month? With getting different rewards to the same size neurons?"

His reply: "Yes, the problem will persist."

My reply: "Ok. Please, formulate what kind of error has caused the problem and offered by you solution in organized form and I will go to the forum and ask suggestions from more experienced users. At this point it looks like something fishy to me.Thanks.

Are we still connected?"

After that there was no answer!!!
 It seems that it is the normal way here to deal with customers.


Could somebody suggest how this error of the system could be amended, please?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-13 15:55:45 UTC | #4

⚠️ Please reassure me that you did not send any ICP, right?!?!

There is no live agent; that was a scam attempt!

PS: I don't know the answer to your original question but, forwarded it to the support team.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-13 15:59:09 UTC | #5

I have not sent any ICP because I do not have any. But I gave them my password phrase for my internet identity and then to my Ledger with which I control my staked ICPs.

That's not good, I don't want to overreact but I would bet they will try to take control and transfer the ICP themselves.

You should regain full control.

[Admin edited by @Severin: censored the links so that nobody falls for the scam]

My ICPs are staked for 8 years.


I have received 2-nd message to my postbox from DevJerry:

"
Our team has opened a ticket for you based on your question. You need to speak with The [DFINITY LIVE SUPPORT CHAT AGENT]() to get answers

Chat with a [LIVE CHAT AGENT]() using ticket ID TM913

You can reach our support team via [DFINITY SUPPORT]()"

And this time the interface is a bit different  and the addres is different 

https://livesupport.fesd.online/      The previous was  https://livesupportchat.app/dfinity/


.....

Actually I am right now in conversation with https://XXXXXX.XXX

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-13 16:05:28 UTC | #8

Not part of the support team but, I would suggest that you sign-in in Internet Identity and remove all Passkeys that seem suspicious (in case they created one) and also create a new recovery phrase.

Since you give them your password phrase they can use your identity. So sure, if you don't have ICP and solely a locked neuron for 8 years, they cannot cash it now but, someday...

Where should I look for those "suspicious Passkeys", please?

And how to "create a new recovery phrase"?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-13 16:15:15 UTC | #11

If you sign-in in Internet Identity: [https://identity.ic0.app/](https://identity.ic0.app/)

1. There, there should no Passkeys that you don't know, that are not yours.

2. Then I would suggest to reset the recorvery phrase since I you said that you shared it right?

As displayed in the 2nd screenshot of my previous post.

Sign-in in Internet Identity -> Recovery Phrase -> Reset

peterparker | 2024-07-13 16:28:20 UTC | #15

Note that I don't know what to do about your Ledger. Just jumped in the thread to quickly help but, here it's not my speciality.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-13 16:34:16 UTC | #16

Somehow I am not getting to the place with any reset or lock options.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-13 16:36:33 UTC | #17

Weird, I literally took the screenshot from one of my demo account in https://identity.ic0.app/. 

Where you able to sign-in in Internet Identity?

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-13 16:37:15 UTC | #18

Yes, I am able to sign.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-13 16:38:02 UTC | #19

Can you send me a screenshot per PM of what you have on your screen in Internet Identity?

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-13 16:44:32 UTC | #20

I have done it right now.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-13 20:53:25 UTC | #21

I've read that you managed to reset your recovery phrase for the Internet Identity. That's good. 

There were also not additional passkeys that have been set in the meantime, did you double checked?

Regarding the ledger, maybe because you mentioned it is a hardware wallet, it is less of an issue with that device since the scammer would also need to physically obtain the device, which is unlikely. I'm curious to hear what others will say to the follow up thread you opened: [https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-change-recovery-phrase-for-a-cold-wallet-without-losing-control-of-staked-icps/33173?u=peterparker](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-change-recovery-phrase-for-a-cold-wallet-without-losing-control-of-staked-icps/33173?u=peterparker)

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-14 20:51:34 UTC | #22

Thanks for your help!
 Yes, due to your timely assistance I have been lucky enough to manage to wiggle out  from this crafty phishing attack.
I think I will not be able to change seed phrase of my Ledger controlling my staked ICP. But it will not help those villains to rob me.  
  
It was a good lesson for me! And your prompt and aptly help was a very psychologically, among other things, stabilizing influence - exactly what was needed at that moment!

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-07-15 05:25:31 UTC | #23

Glad to hear I could be of any help!

If anyone has any advice on what additional things could be done here, please share.

-------------------------

Severin | 2024-07-15 06:50:19 UTC | #24

Regarding suspicious messages people may get: You can flag DMs just like any other message. The three dots below the message unveil additional options, and then you can flag a DM that you suspect contains a scam link.

We (the forum admins) will gladly ban any scammers you may get in your DMs, and if it is not a scammer we can also tell you that

-------------------------

Severin | 2024-07-15 06:56:04 UTC | #25

Also, I banned the user that messaged you originally (not only based on @kilemar's report above, I saw some stronger evidence than word of mouth).

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-15 17:13:03 UTC | #26

Thanks.
I have flagged the second  scammer DevJerry right now who still has not been banned.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 07:52:36 UTC | #27

One more suggestion.
The first scammer by name Sandeep1 had under it word "SUPPORT" visible when I clicked his name to  see his personal details.  Now I understand that it is a nickname or something like that. 
It was giving an impression that he was somebody from some kind of support.

I had clicked his name to check his personal details and they were clearly very short term and unimpressive. I should have got more suspicious then. But I had written it off  on a possibility that he could be a new team member which could be possible. The decisive influence was that SUPPORT attribute. 

 The second scammer DevJerry did not have any additional misleading words  but just "Jeremy".

I think the forum has to make it impossible for a member to arrange an attachment to his/her name of any false attribute like in this case "SUPPORT". 

No one should to be able to misrepresent oneself by this means!

......

In addition, since de-facto this forum has become a very profitable hunting ground for scammers it would be very useful to send all new and old members a link to a catalog of all known cases of attempts to scam with detailed description and a list of all possible measures to fight them back. Maybe it would be good to have a separate rubric or a category of topics.

I would introduce a special badge for reading that information - "Master of safety"! May be even with a minimum competency test after it.  I would send this welcome link to all new members for sure!

Since judging from my personal experience in  cases of being scammed time and awareness of possible efficient counteractions is of essence it is a DIRECT OBLIGATION  of the forum to take this safety measure seriously. We ALL are dealing with A LOT OF MONEY here and for some people it is matter of personal fortunes. Therefore any childish  or infantile pretense that at this forum all is safe and peachy  is real NEGLIGENCE and FIDUCIARY ineptitude if not a collusion with the scammers.


.....

Right now I received the 3-rd  phishing attack to my postbox:

finity_modrator

" Hey @kilemar ,

A support ticket UI:7463 has been created for you and sent to the support team regarding your inquiry. Connect through the [admin edit by @Severin: censored URL to prevent people from falling for the scam] [live support]() page for a step-by-step guide on how to recover your ICP.

Click on the live chat icon at the bottom corner of the page to initiate chat"


And judging from the fact that all of them gave links to a different interfaces they are all independently operating here. I wonder how many of them are at this forum?  

......

So, clearly, I consider the fact that after so many years of existence of this forum no efficacious prophylactic measures which I have offered to introduce in this post have not been already taken by the forum indicate a circumstantial evidence of collusion of it with the scammers!!!  I do not consider myself the smartest person around who could in just two days  figure out what HAS TO BE DONE to make it almost impossible to continue to scam members of the forum of their hard earned money! 

  No, I am not joking or exaggerating!!!

My logic is undeniable. Honest people in all cases when real money is involved do not hesitate to OPENLY demonstrate their concerns for safety. No sane person would consider presence of an armed guard at the bank brunch as an inappropriate measure rather on the contrary - an absence of one could get an cautious man uneasy.  

I am thinking now how those scammers are reading what I have written so far and laughing out loud at my futile attempt to hurt their chances to succeed knowing very well that nothing will be done here about really ensuring safety!!!

I guess I have written enough to get banned by the forum team!?
Because the choice is clear it is either to promptly implement what has been suggested or to remove this thread and ban me to pretend that nothing bad has happened. I personally would bet that it will be the second implemented!!!

.....

I have tried to search "safety at the forum" among topics of the forum and no one of the 33 results showed anything dealing with the fact that the forum has become a very profitable hunting ground for scammers. Is it just an accidental circumstance or it is by design?

Discourse (our forum software) does not allow filtering the 'name' field of a user. We're checking if we can disable this entirely for new users.

The other thing we could do is disable DMs, but that also affects a lot of legitimate use cases. We'll see if we can restrict DMing for new users for a few days.

[quote="kilemar, post:27, topic:33148"]

Why? You didn't attack anyone with ad-hominem insults, you didn't try to scam anyone. I'm not a fan of the writing style, but that's a personal preference and obviously not an offense against the rules.

---

We honestly try to do our best. We actually agree with a lot of what you say and are frustrated by the situation too. Just to illustrate that we do a fair amount of moderation: In [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/lost-control-of-my-icp-after-it-were-staked-on-nns-with-ledger-hardware-wallet/33215) alone we already banned three scammers in the last 24 hours.

So far we have not removed the ability to DM because we think having the option is valuable enough for legitimate use cases. 

Because of this thread, we actually poked around the forum settings a bit more and now configured it such that you need trust level 2 to add external links in your posts/DMs, and raised some DM requirements. Let's hope this helps a bit.

-------------------------

Ang | 2024-07-16 09:24:44 UTC | #29

We have implemented some additional controls, and restrictions on the forum which will limit the ability of users to perform certain actions that are frequently abused by scammers to send phishing links. I don't want to go into detail about what they are but we anticipate that they will greatly reduce the amount of phishing messages going forward. @kilemar You requested limiting users ability to edit their "title" however this isn't possible in discourse. However, the new changes should still limit phishing attacks even though titles can still be changed.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 16:24:22 UTC | #30

 So, if my understanding is correct there will not be any prophylactic informing of the forum members of phishing attack scammers. They will have to figure out all this at their own risk and expense? Only after the attack.
To  draw an analogy  it is similar to the puritan's policy of very strict but extremely limited sexual education of children. All in name of protecting morale, of course! By this manner of informing everyone about STD is learning exclusively by his /her  own experience. 

Way to go!

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 16:38:40 UTC | #31

I personally am not afraid of scammers!
I am just expressing my disappointment at the fact that this forum presented me with my fist experience with the phishing attack. Three of them  in a row within one day! And all this just because of my as it turned out absolutely unfounded belief that at least at a crypto forum administration has taken all  the reasonably necessary and easy measures to protect its members.    
Now I will know better!
The only REALLY necessary measure is just giving a timely warning to a new member that at this forum there is scammer's presence and presenting the most common tricks of theirs.

You should not expect this for any forum since there is no way to know beforehand who is a scammer if they join with an email that isn't blacklisted.

The best a forum staff can do is post information somewhere so that users are aware of potential scams.  And then of course ban those that try to scam users which usually happens after the fact, assuming someone reports it.

Actually, even earlier I had wrote the same. It is easy to see in my previous posts. 

"In addition, since de-facto this forum has become a very profitable hunting ground for scammers it would be very useful to send all new and old members a link to a catalog of all known cases of attempts to scam with detailed description and a list of all possible measures to fight them back.

I think your point could be made without the exaggerated conclusions (ahem...insults) of this forum "being profitable for scammers"

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 18:30:31 UTC | #38

 When a polite person see something clearly disgraceful he/she finds appropriate terms to comment on it.

" I do not consider myself the smartest person around who could in just two days figure out what HAS TO BE DONE to make it almost impossible to continue to scam members of the forum of their hard earned money!

No, I am not joking or exaggerating!!!

No sane person would consider presence of an armed guard at the bank brunch as an inappropriate measure rather on the contrary - an absence of one could get a cautious man uneasy."

My point is that since NOTHING will be changed in this respect then, willingly or not, the forum is helping those operators to stay profitable! Logic is logical!

If you can explain about what specifically I am not correct, please do it.

-------------------------

CkICP | 2024-07-16 19:06:47 UTC | #39

Your logic is so undeniable that you gave away your passkey to a stranger. Bravo 👏


I hope this thread gets locked up because it's turning into a broken record repeating the same ole insults to the forum.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 20:12:03 UTC | #41

Unfortunately, even absolutely logical person can by fulled if has been caught in situation where he/she feels can trust. Because it is not a matter of logic but of psychology. 
That is specifically what needs to be prevented  IMHO. And it seems it is exactly why it will not be done, at least according to my logic!
So, yes, I expect it will be deleted! You are absolutely right.
By that it will just prove my point about the collusion, willing or just by negligence!
I think that for a victim of a scammer there is no big difference, would you agree?

Unfortunately I feel like this might be part of the issue.

My best advice for people new to crypto, like you, is:
1)Never answer direct messages.
2) Never give our password / seed phrase no matter what.

Glad you didn't lose anything but it's everyone's own personal responsibility to safeguard their assets.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 22:20:37 UTC | #43

To me in this particular case it is not a matter of personal responsibility or otherwise!
It goes  without saying that those who have become victims of schemers would find that there no one to really help them. 

 It is a matter of what this forum can or cannot do in good faith  to minimize risk for those who came to it to get some help with ICP. To get blindly robbed just because of some hypocritical puritanical attitude of the administration of the forum is a pity IMHO.

Not a matter of personal responsibility? I'm sorry that you feel that way and it clearly shows that you aren't ready to be involved in crypto. Do you rely 100% on your bank to keep you from sending someone you online banking info? I don't comprehend how you expect others to protect your investments when you can't be bothered to look out for them yourself.

-------------------------

kilemar | 2024-07-16 22:21:26 UTC | #46

Unfortunately, I see that after you have read written by me: " It goes without saying that those who have become victims of schemers would find that there no one to really help them." you completely misunderstood my point.

It just that at this forum from the very beginning one can find that actually: " Every man for himself."
Even if it would cost nothing at least not to set up a newcomer to become an easy pray.
There is nothing new in the tactic of turning blame on a victim.

The word forum in English comes from Latin forum meaning "marketplace, open space, public place." So here we go, treat the people you meet in the forum the same way you would in a public place - this is what I always do.

I have gotten the notion that for some here it is at least kind of fun to see newcomers get robbed. Especially due to actually created here very conducive situation. May be it is helping to increase sense of self esteem. Empathy is not necessarily characteristic for everyone.

Hi @Severin,

Is there any specific requirements to achieve trust level 2 on this forum? Asking because I'm still "Basic" user (trust level 1), but I already meet the requirements to be a "Member" user (trust level 2) mentioned on official discourse blog: blog .discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels.

Thanks.

-------------------------

Temo_Koki | 2024-07-17 12:12:45 UTC | #53

After writing this reply, I received a message saying that I became a member, even though I already met the requirements for membership. It seems there might be some issues with the forum settings. For example, on my Summary page, it shows that I have “0 topics created,” but when I click on it, it shows my topic.

-------------------------

Severin | 2024-07-17 12:14:59 UTC | #54

I don't know, I'm only a mod, not an admin. @Ang can you answer this?

-------------------------

Ang | 2024-07-17 13:02:17 UTC | #55

Your account is already Trust Level 2, "member" is the same as Trust Level 2. I can see you've created one topic when viewing your profile. Let me know if you have any other questions about your account status.
