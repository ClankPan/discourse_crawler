Hi developers and community members, 

I was wondering if it could be an option to create a balance ($,â‚¬,Â¥) overview on the NNS Dapp in the near future? 
Maybe even with some chart graphics? 
I don't see why this would be impossible really.
Is this something that could be taken in consideration?

There is for now already : 
"ICP" / "NEURONS" / "VOTING" / "CANISTERS"

Why not to add a fifth option with "balance overview" and a chart timeline of the staked neurons.

It's just a suggestion, but i do think this would be really appreciated by a lots of people.

Thanks for taking a thought on this! ðŸ¤“
