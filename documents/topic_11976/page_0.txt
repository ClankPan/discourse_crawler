*Proposal to establish a carbon footprint and sustainability policy for the Internet Computer.*

Hello ICP community!

I’m creating this thread to begin a discussion around a Green Proposal for the NNS. My intention in this thread is to gather feedback, support and community buy-in for this proposal.

My proposal is for a “Sustainability NNS Proposal” to the Internet Computer. This proposal would have three key attributes:

* Ask DFINITY to conduct a carbon footprint / environmental impact assessment - either through internal resources or hiring an external consultant to answer basic questions about what the carbon footprint of running a IC Subnet is, where that electricity is sourced, what the total cost per transaction is on the IC blockchain
* Ratify that the Internet Computer community believes in global warming, it is a man made problem with huge ramifications for people everywhere, and it’s in the Internet Computer’s interest to support efforts to be more environmentally sustainable
* Add an “energy consumption” reporting panel to the IC Network Status dashboard

**Motivation**

It is an ethical imperative for all of us to work together to improve the future of our planet and ecosystem. Taking a position as an environmentally sustainable crypto is good business for the Internet Computer, positive branding and positioning for the Internet Computer, and largely already taking place - we just need to codify it.

The goal of this proposal is to educate people that sustainability = environmental + social + economic impacts. Ideally the IC can address all of these impacts eventually, and this policy is starting by focusing on environmental impact.

“Going green” provides a marketing opportunity for The Internet Computer to enter the discussion around electricity usage and the blockchain. Solana’s report on electricity usage earlier this year made massive PR waves in the mainstream media outside of the crypto echo chamber. [(1)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-solana-transaction-uses-little-114956337.html)

In addition, discussion of Bitcoin and Eth’s POW model has become a toxic talking point about the evils of crypto - hard numbers and coherent talking points about IC’s policy on these issues would give our marketing a new major talking point to push. I want to be able to answer inquiries like this one from twitter with strong data and a clear message. [(2)](https://twitter.com/Skeletoony/status/1505953212939001863)

Finally - my intention is that this proposal be structured to set a general direction for the Internet Computer when it comes to environmental concerns. The Internet Computer is currently positioning itself for massive breakout growth, and nothing in this proposal should slow or limit that growth. Instead it combines research and reporting with marketing and intention - we can look at the data that comes back and submit additional proposals related to this topic in the future. The Internet Computer was designed with energy efficiency in mind, and already claims “Systems built 100% on the Internet Computer run with efficiency comparable to the traditional IT stack, providing massive savings in costs and protecting the environment.” [(3)](https://dfinity.org/icig.pdf) The Internet Computer is already a highly efficient green blockchain and web host. [(4)](https://icpjesse.medium.com/crypto-in-the-age-of-climate-change-d3816bd016f9) This proposal aims to codify that fact, measure it, and officially promote it.

I am looking for actionable feedback to improve this proposal, help communicate its goals more clearly, and rally support for its passing overwhelmingly on the NNS.

My intention is to produce Rev 2 for further comments ~seven days from now, and close the thread and submit the proposal to the NNS in two weeks.

Thank you for your feedback and consideration!

I like this proposal a lot.  I think you are making a smart business case for how the IC could differentiate itself on this topic compares to other blockchains.  This is important to a lot of people globally and even if it's not important to some people it doesn't seems like it harms anyone.  This seems like low hanging fruit for the internet computer.

Thanks for tearing yourself away from other NNS drama to comment Wenzel. Looking forward to more feedback and edits from you, and very appreciative of your support since I’ll be relying on ICPMN to submit the proposal for me :crossed_fingers:

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-06 22:49:31 UTC | #5

Just to clarify, it’s not ICPMN that is submitting this proposal.  It is me individually.  I would do it for anyone who wants to submit a well deliberated proposal, even if I don’t agree with it, because I want to make it easy for people to submit quality proposals.  I have no idea how ICPMN would vote on this proposal, but I can say I will vote yes.

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-06 22:59:39 UTC | #6

sorry for introducing confusion.  I'm off to make a "certified fresh by Wenzel" badge for it so people know I've got endorsements. (actually making a movie poster style art with actual quotes of endorsement isn't a bad idea....)

Feedback on the three bullet points:

Firstly, point 2,

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
Ratify that the Internet Computer community believes in global warming, it is a man made problem with huge ramifications for people everywhere, and it’s in the Internet Computer’s interest to support efforts to be more environmentally sustainable
[/quote]

I don't think this is necessary. Beliefs fall under the same category as Opinions, and some people's opinions will never align with the majority. Focus on the facts.

Your first bullet point:

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
Ask DFINITY to conduct a carbon footprint / environmental impact assessment - either through internal resources or hiring an external consultant to answer basic questions about what the carbon footprint of running a IC Subnet is, where that electricity is sourced, what the total cost per transaction is on the IC blockchain
[/quote]

This is a clear, "Yes." In terms of type of assessment and internal, or external; here is a paper produced by Tezos, though it was privately commissioned it uses the review process, which is absolutely essential: https://tezos.com/2021-12-06-Tezos-LCA-Final.pdf . All this stuff will take time, commissioning a private study like this would seem the quickest way to get the ball rolling. 

Regarding, "...where that electricity is sourced..." IPFS is working on a progressive approach. They intend to issue Bakers using renewable energy with certificates and IPFS users will be able to choose these Bakers as custodians of their data https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-green/

Transparency is key, it therefore feels appropriate to suggest Dfinity works with several Universities with leading climate and crypto departments from different parts of the world to carry out a range of studies. It may be that other blockchains are more efficient, but that is not the point (IMO). The first objective is to design a provably robust reporting mechanism so people know IC emission data is true, the second objective is to establish that the IC is less impactful than traditional/legacy systems.

Not all truths will be palatable, but without the information appropriate decisions cannot be made. 
More broadly, using universities could enable comparison with compute and storage on AWS, comparison of streaming on YouTube and Spotify, comparison of payment transactions with Credit and Debit Cards. This kind of data may assist Developers with their architectural choices (IDK, but it's a starting point). 

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
Add an “energy consumption” reporting panel to the IC Network Status dashboard
[/quote]

This is also a, "yes." However, it probably follows some of the above.

Accepting that there will be a climate impact is necessary. Nothing is entirely "Carbon Neutral"  and one has to be mindful that the public isn't stupid. Therefore, Carbon Offsetting is a tool that needs to be used carefully (https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/golden-age-of-greenwash/). 

Finally, what IF... the Community Fund included a pool of money Universities studying climate impact could apply to for (say) $10k grants to top up nearly funded studies?

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-10 21:25:24 UTC | #12

@NickM  Just wanted to drop a note to say thank you for such considered and nuanced feedback. I'm about to post another comment specifically on bullet point two, and I'm in agreement on updating it. I'd welcome specific language suggestions for how to rewrite it for the same resulting impacting decision making prioritizing sustainable solutions, but without the belief part. Or would you say simply cut it altogether?

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-10 21:33:46 UTC | #13

Pulling in this conversation between myself, Coolpineapple18 and @wpb on twitter which I think has excellent feedback (edited to remove usernames for readability)

threaded from this tweet: https://twitter.com/CoolPineapple18/status/1512327525032251395 

🍍I personally believe that the climate and biodiversity crisis is the biggest threat we face and like the idea of making the #IC the greenest blockchain. So I generally support the concrete steps to monitor consumption, have a dashboard and target reductions…

 🍍…However I’m uncomfortable with the NNS ratifying a *belief*. IMHO global warming is a fact supported by a huge amount of scientific data but I don’t think the NNS should be in the business of making statements. The point of blockchains is credible neutrality.

🍍 If we open the door of making non technical statements of belief then we have become then things get very political very fast. As individuals we may stand with Ukrainian, believe in global warming, support BLM… ect but a technical system should not be in the business of belief..

🍍we should be a neutral platform for the world with certain technical properties - including energy efficiency - not a DAO with beliefs that takes a stance on issues. If we do that we lose people countries and cultures who disagree as potential users.

Then @wpb [chimed in](https://twitter.com/BartlettWenzel/status/1512434960442949638):
 *I can agree with your concern about ratifying a “belief” and wouldn’t mind seeing that language changed in the proposal to something that would be perceived to be more diplomatic.  However, there is a strong marketing opportunity here that makes the proposal worth pursuing.*

🍍I would just edit the middle bullet point to make environmentally sustainability an ongoing objective. (Similar in framing to long term R&D proposals on other topics https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-proposals-on-long-term-r-d-plans/9261)

🍍 BTW: There is some tension with performance and security eg replication factor but we can frame this as an objective “how do we improve environmental sustainability without sacrificing security and performance” and I think that question could lead to interesting designs.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-04-11 07:48:32 UTC | #14

Cut it. 

And I say this with an itchy typing finger as I am a sucker for a debate! But let's not create a drain on headspace for countering individual opinions. 

FYI: I am a fan of the Trivium, which structures arguments into three parts:

Grammar = identify the object of the discussion. A "Sustainability NNS Proposal" will provide transparency of the Internet Computers energy usage. Metrics can include, txts, storage, etc. Energy usage of the InternetComputer is currently unknown. A "Sustainability NNS Proposal" addresses the absence of such data. 

Logic = examples of the grammar in action. Other chains are reporting energy usage of txts, storage, etc (examples) and are delivering reports (examples). This enables comparison of energy usage (examples). Those blockchains reporting Energy usage are attracting attention from energy conscious developers and users. 

Rhetoric = personal opinion. This always come last! IMO transparent reporting of the InternetComputer's Energy Usage MAY provide dev insight into more efficient tech/smart contract solutions and MAY help society address the Climate Crisis. BUT we will only know this once we have access to trustworthy data.

Hi All!  Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback on here or on twitter, especially @NickM @diegop @alexa.smith @wpb @Kyle_Langham and CoolPineapple on twitter - your time and effort to engage in this project has been super helpful, and as always reminds me what makes the IC community and the NNS unique. 

My edits are minor and simple: I'm eliminating the second bullet point about belief and climate change - I'd love to include it, but would rather separate it out into a separate proposal down the road with more action attached to it for long term sustainability planning.  This proposal works best as a first step to gather data and set a broad direction. 

My updated bullet points are below - please feel free to submit more feedback and we will move this to the NNS shortly for voting! Because the motivation section is unchanged, I'm omitting it from this part, but feedback there is also welcome. 

cheers!

Hi. 

This is Luis from DFINITY. 
My team was responsible for supporting node providers with building the 1st generation of data centers founding the infrastructure of the IC.

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
* Ask DFINITY to conduct a carbon footprint / environmental impact assessment - either through internal resources or hiring an external consultant to answer basic questions about what the carbon footprint of running a IC Subnet is, where that electricity is sourced, what the total cost per transaction is on the IC blockchain
[/quote]
The infrastructure of the IC runs in professional data centers. The majority of the datacenter providers are already carbon neutral. This is mainly because this market is an oligopoly which doesn't allow many differences between competitors. This of course means that we have to trust their emission reports. 
We thought about making carbon neutral data centers mandatory, but there were different reasons why we decided not to do so:
* The community wouldn't be able to verify that and as I said above on the end everybody including the node provider would need to trust the data center provider or the entities that certified them.  
* This requirement would exclude smaller data centers providers that are important for the decentralisation of the network. 
* The footprint of the IC isn't only defined by the power consumption of the nodes and the cooling. A lot of resources and energy was needed to build the hardware. The intent of the IC is that every node that was added to network will be used as long as there enough nodes to create a subnet. Because they are running in a optimal environment and seven nodes are enough to create a subnet the IC nodes can run for much longer than in legacy cloud platforms. 
* We don't want to support greenwashing. The sustainability of the IC isn't lonely defined by the power consumption. 

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
* Ratify that the Internet Computer community believes in global warming, it is a man made problem with huge ramifications for people everywhere, and it’s in the Internet Computer’s interest to support efforts to be more environmentally sustainable
[/quote]
Not sure if this needs an NNS proposal. I would even say that ppl that don't believe in global warming and its consequences would hardly understand what the IC is. 
Speaking from three years at DFINITY I can confirm that environmental sustainability is an objective in almost everything we do. From avoiding traveling and commuting to refurbishing workstations to avoiding plastics in the office. 
The interest of the IC is the sustainable use of all resources involved to run a canister. Beginning with hardware and going up to the protocol efficiency. And there is a lot of potential for improvements but different levels of control. The community can improve the protocol efficiency but we can't control the hardware efficiency. I personally would like to see hardware vendors optimizing the environmental footprint of the hardware. Actively recycling resources and using them to build new hardware for example. Or using reusable packaging for their hardware. 

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
* Add an “energy consumption” reporting panel to the IC Network Status dashboard
[/quote]
That's technically hard to achieve. Estimating the power consumptions doesn't make sense. We would need to enforce smart PDUs in the data centers. We did that with our lab racks. These PDUs are expensive and data centers bill you for installing and running custom PDUs. Some data centers don't allow them because they need that data themselves to decide about cooling needs based on the power consumption. 
Even if we would be able to get that data from every rack running IC nodes it would only show the power consumption of the nodes. The cooling power isn't measured. Some data centers are highly efficient. Hot aisle and cold aisle are separated and controlled strictly. They have recuperators that are getting back the energy from the hot aisle. Other data centers care much less about the cooling efficiency which can make almost the half of the total power consumption.

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-14 22:32:24 UTC | #21

Hi Luis - 

Thanks for your detailed notes, as well as your work at DFINITY! 

I wanted to provide a few questions and follow up to your notes:

> * We don’t want to support greenwashing. The sustainability of the IC isn’t lonely defined by the power consumption.

I picking this out for a stand-in for all of your notes from my first bullet point, but they are all good.  Please note this section asks for an audit and report, not a requirement. I also fully support your statement here about not embracing greenwashing - I guess my question is how to do get more info to work with and market IC as a green blockchain without greenwashing?  Right now I have almost nothing to work with regarding IC's carbon footprint.  I embrace you wanting a holistic picture, but I also feel like I want more reporting and info than we have now.  I'm open to rewording this section asking for a report if you have specific suggestions on how to do it.

> Not sure if this needs an NNS proposal.

I have removed the second bulletpoint from my proposal per earlier feedback

> That’s technically hard to achieve. 

Re: my request on a reporting panel - I want greater visibility and data. This was the solution I proposed, I welcome a rewrite that moves it to a place you and your team can support. 

Thank you again for taking the time to read and provide an insider's view of my proposal - I'd love actionable suggestions on how to improve it to make it something we can implement and act on when it (hopefully) passes. 

- Jesse

I hate seeing someone fall for the climate change meme so I would like to invite you to re-open your mind and play with the idea you have been had. A lot of countries already force their citizens to pay a climate/carbon tax so in the eyes of our rulers who mind you only allow us to use their "approved" power sources the "problem" is long $olved, don't forget to tip your taxman either.

If the programming is buried too deep within you mind and you cannot let go of their incepted ideas then rest assured you will feel mighty happy when carbon credits get brought in.

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-17 19:53:48 UTC | #23

Since conversation has died down, I will move this to being a proposal on an accelerated timeline. Please leave additional feedback or notes!

NickM | 2022-04-18 21:51:16 UTC | #24

Thank you for acknowledging this is a complex problem and for sharing concerns regarding gathering data. 

Similar concerns are acknowledged by the authors of “The Energy Footprint of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms Beyond Proof-of-Work” published on April 4th 2022. This study has good provenance, being a collaboration between University College London, Imperial College, Kings College and University of Bayreuth. The concerns, including data integrity and hardware configuration, are approached with appropriate scientific best practice, “We approach this research gap by formalizing a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains.” https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03667.pdf The abstract is quite short and is definitely worth a speedy read. 

The above study compares Ethereum, Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot, Tezos and Hedera.

This Jan 2022 report by Crypto Carbon Rating Institute looks at Total electricity consumption [kWh/year], Electricity per node [kWh/year], Electricity per transaction [Wh/Tx] and Total carbon emissions [tCO2e/year] for Cardano, Polkadot, Solana, Tezos, Avalanche and Algorand. No single blockchain out performs all the others across all criteria, which isn’t surprising https://www.carbon-ratings.com/dl/pos-report-2022 

The conversation around energy consumption across all aspects of IT is only going to grow. Therefore, finding ways for the Internet Computer to participate in these discussion is imperative, or once again it will be notable only by its absence.

@icpjesse Hold up there I don't think we solved this whole part of what sustainability data DFINITY thinks it can feasibly get. I have a few questions/potential solutions for @Luis 

[quote="Luis, post:20, topic:11976"]

[/quote]

I understand that it's hard to understand the full impact, but hopefully we can start with a few basic metrics that are based off two things.

1. Power consumption from the Boundary Nodes (which I understand are 100% DFINITY controlled atm)
2. Emissions reports from the data centers that are running nodes on the IC.

This way, DFINITY can present boundary node power consumption estimates with near ~100% certainty, and can provide 3rd party metrics as well. Those 3rd party metrics may be inaccurate, but the goal would be to start by trying to provide at least one or two metrics that are accurate to within an order of magnitude.

I would imagine DFINITY would want to use this information to market the IC, and the more accurate the data from data centers becomes the better. It might even make sense to incentivize the data centers that provide accurate power consumption with additional rewards for the time being.

-------------------------

icpjesse | 2022-04-18 23:01:28 UTC | #26

Just FYI I am moving ahead with getting the proposal submitted to the NNS.  My reasoning for doing so is two fold: 

1. All of our action items are "Ask DFINITY..." so they are nonbinding and the answers to these questions will need to be solved by DFINITY no matter what. I'm optimistic it passing will help management decide to allocate further resources to help answer the questions more fully. 

2. It's very likely that the cost of having an NNS proposal fail will dramatically rise in the near future. The fate of this good-faith proposal is unknown, but given the controversial nature of it, failing is of course a real possibility. Given how much discussion here has slowed, I'm motivated to get it submitted. I expect that once live on the NNS this thread will become significantly more active. 

By design, this proposal leaves everything in the hands of DFINITY for execution - we are just trying to set a direction and voice this need for another marketing tool (plus save the planet, etc).

Sorry @icpjesse for the delayed response. We had a long easter holiday in Europe. 

[quote="icpjesse, post:21, topic:11976"]
I guess my question is how to do get more info to work with and market IC as a green blockchain without greenwashing?
[/quote]
I tried to explain that DFINITY can't provide such details because we don't have them. Technically the node providers won't be able to provide that details without installing additional hardware. Even if they would do that these very precise metrics wouldn't allow us to draw any conclusions about the sustainability of the IC. 

You could do an estimation of the current total power consumption of the IC with details that are already publicly visible: The number of nodes per data center and node provider you can get from the ICA's public dashboard. This gives you a number of active nodes per DC. There you can also find the DC provider/owner and look for their carbon footprint. On the ICA website you can find the specs for the current dual-socket AMD Rome nodes. With these details you can calculate a total power consumption of the IC under full load and how much of the power is provided by DCs that claim to use renewable power sources. It still doesn't say anything about the sustainability of IC. 

Drawing conclusions to sustainability based on such energy source and consumption details, nevertheless how precise they are, is what I would call greenwashing. 
Wasting power stays a wastage nevertheless where the power is coming from and wastage is never sustainable. What the power is used for is therefore relevant for the sustainability in the very first place? 

Let's assume we need to run something that is sustainable by nature. Let's say a car pooling or a second hand exchange portal. The sustainability could then be reduced to the protocol efficiency and its energy source. A comparison between a legacy LAMP setup and the IC would probably already show a higher efficiency if you take the redundancy and geological distribution of a subnet into account. But that's hard to prove and we are improving the protocol efficiency constantly. 
But now let's assume we need to run something that can only work on-chain. Let's say a voting machine providing the first democratic elections in an autocracy or an NFT portal giving the  exploitation of the rights back to the artists. Here you would need to compare the IC with other blockchain projects where the technical edge of IC would most likely show a higher protocol efficiency.

2. Emissions reports from the data centers that are running nodes on the IC.
[/quote]

Referring to 1. 
Boundary and replica nodes have almost the same power consumption. The utilisation and efficiency is different though. A boundary node is basically a nginx reverse proxy that translates http to ic and back. 10 boundary nodes are currently serving about 600 nodes. They could serve much more nodes and subnets but the redundancy and geographical distribution is asking for more boundary nodes not the performance. That's why soon every node provide could run one or more boundary node based on the traffic in the region the DC is located.   

Referring to 2. 
As explained before DFINITY doesn't have this information. The node providers do and everybody who wants to know that can find this out by themselves based on the information that the ICA is providing. And again these reports would probably only be trustworthy for some us. They can't be fully verified.

I don't see any open questions nor something that exclusively DFINITY would be able to answer. 
Everything you were asking for can be evaluated by anyone. The necessary information is provided by the ICA (see post above). 
The IC is a decentralized system where exclusive powers and knowledge should not exist.

Europe had four free days. That could explain the slow down. And perhaps the fact that there isn't much to discuss. 

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
The goal of this proposal is to educate people that sustainability = environmental + social + economic impacts. Ideally the IC can address all of these impacts eventually, and this policy is starting by focusing on environmental impact.
[/quote]
I would say that this goal is already achieved and for my understanding your proposal only seems to focus on the environmental aspects of sustainability. 
The IC isn't DFINITY. DFINITY makes a big part of what we currently see as the IC, but not all of it. There are many other entities involved. 
As I explained above someone outside DFINITY could start modeling scenarios and thereby prove the sustainability of the IC in all aspects for those who didn't understood that yet. For the sake of credibility this shouldn't be DFINITY but some independent entity.

Appreciate your feedback, peek behind the scenes and detailed notes @Luis (and also thank you for your work at DFINITY too!)

@Luis thanks for the response!

Just focusing on boundary nodes here then

[quote="Luis, post:28, topic:11976"]
Boundary and replica nodes have almost the same power consumption.
[/quote]

How do you know this?

[quote="Luis, post:28, topic:11976"]
The utilisation and efficiency is different though.
[/quote]

What if we just started with overall power consumption and not overall efficiency? Efficiency sounds a bit harder.


[quote="Luis, post:28, topic:11976"]
10 boundary nodes are currently serving about 600 nodes. They could serve much more nodes and subnets but the redundancy and geographical distribution is asking for more boundary nodes not the performance. That’s why soon every node provide could run one or more boundary node based on the traffic in the region the DC is located.
[/quote]

I’m assuming there weren’t always 60 nodes per boundary node, so it might be interesting to look at how power consumption has gone up over time. I also assume we can also look at metrics like overall traffic coming into the boundary node and compare that with the power utilization on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

[quote="Luis, post:28, topic:11976"]
As explained before DFINITY doesn’t have this information. The node providers do and everybody who wants to know that can find this out by themselves based on the information that the ICA is providing. And again these reports would probably only be trustworthy for some us. They can’t be fully verified.
[/quote]

Totally agree, would it be fair to say that a node provider could benefit in some way (grant/community fund) from investing the time to get this information?

@icpjesse Maybe the next step here then is to get in contact with a node provider and try to make this happen?

Because the specs are on the ICA website. Load and specs are almost the same.

And leave sustainability also out? :slight_smile: 

I previously explained how the total power consumption under full load can be calculated. You could propose an average load over all subnets metric on the public dashboard and by that add the power consumption. But it would be interesting to know why (if you want my vote). What do you want to derive from the power consumption? 

[quote="icpjesse, post:1, topic:11976"]
Taking a position as an environmentally sustainable crypto is good business for the Internet Computer, positive branding and positioning for the Internet Computer, and largely already taking place - we just need to codify it.
[/quote]
*A positive branding and positioning for the IC* in the context of sustainability just based on power consumptions, estimations and trusts could be seen as greenwashing.

[/quote]
That's why this needs the social and economic (efficiency) aspects that I previously explained and you initially proposed. 
This just needs much more research and refinement. I'm personally a huge fan of such ideas. Not necessarily by teaching others but just by proving that there is a sustainability by design in the IC.

[/quote]

So then we can simply do something like multiply the power consumption of a single IC node multiplied by the (number of replica nodes + number of boundary nodes) and now we have a very rough estimate (to within an order of magnitude) of the power consumption of the IC infrastructure.

Then we can make a similar comparison against Bitcoin/Ethereum, and can maybe postulate on what the overall power consumption of a fully scaled up IC would look like in the future. Would it be equal to that of a large city, a small country, etc.?

I wouldn't want to make any blanket statements if you don't feel confident extrapolating some of the power consumption stats like this, but if we can provide an error boundary of within an order of magnitude - that has to be at least as accurate as many of the 10-20+ year climate forecasts we get from the IPCC, right?

I think this is where we disagree. I would define "Greenwashing" is providing a false narrative about sustainability practices - empty marketing with no real action. What IC (and you!) have done is design a very efficient system, one worth talking about. It's not greenwashing if we really are taking a sustainable action. I want to know the details of what we are already doing, and promote that. 

If your position is that any marketing related to sustainability is "greenwashing," then I think we disagree on the premise, and would agree you should not vote for it. But I see failing to do so is a self-goal when it comes to marketing the IC.

"A node consumes about 500W  in idle state and about 700 W under full load. App subnet has 13 nodes, and can handle 750Tps, so 0.000000123340977 kWh per transaction under full load." 

This comment was posted by a Dfinity researcher on social media following an IC energy consumption claim by a third party, which clearly deserved a bit of challenge/clarification. 

This proposal should ensure third parties are able to make informed comments without relying upon the happenstance of a knowledgeable Dfinity Foundation member stumbling across and responding appropriately to poorly informed reporting.

There we agree. I think the disagreement we have is on the sustainability practices. Measuring the consumed power and comparing it with other crypto projects without any relation to use cases, workloads or social benefit I hesitate to see as a practice that proves the sustainability of the IC. 
The power consumption and total environmental footprint is needed though for the real actions.

Happenstance? I know about that tweet. BTW Jan isn't just some researcher but the CTO of DFINITY.  
I provided the power consumptions details. He asked me to respond to this thread that Jesse linked in his response. Not sure if you read the comments of this tweet. This isn't about sustainability but some abstract comparison of coincodex that used obviously wrong assumptions about the energy consumption of something that you could call a transaction on the IC. Dom's reply shows how uncomparable the IC actually is. The coincodex article that Jan is revering to shows that even better. Pulled out of that context Jan's tweet could be understood as greenwashing, but what coincodex tried I think is very near to what Jesse is trying to achieve. What I'm trying to say is that the precision on the energy consumption of IC, even with the correction that Jan tweeted, isn't sufficient to draw conclusions about the sustainability of the IC.

@Luis I've been following Dfinity since 2016 and have participated at many levels over the years. ::edit removed content::

We are all on the same side and shouldn't be sniping at each others' assumed knowledge and understanding, but focus on the proposal, which is to provide some level of transparency around energy consumption.

Luis | 2022-04-25 15:46:38 UTC | #40

[In this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/r247ss/energy_usage_of_a_transaction/hm5grt2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) my colleague Alin tries to calculate the power consumption per transaction. It shows how many variables need to be estimated and how poor the comparison with other projects still is.

icpjesse | 2022-04-25 16:02:46 UTC | #41

That post is what inspired my original Medium article about ICP energy usage, and submitting this NNS proposal. 

Thanks again for your engagement on this issue Luis - we might not agree on everything but I really appreciate your thoughtfulness on this topic and work on ICP.

Thank you for making this proposal. I think making the network carbon neutral is a great first step. We have been dedicated to a similar cause at earthwallet.io (the first self custody wallet for the IC), and recently [partnered with klimadao](https://twitter.com/KlimaDAO/status/1517389114265726976) (the largest crypto carbon credit dao) to make this a reality by offering users a way to purchase carbon credits to offset their txs.

What I would suggest is the IC does something similar to [Polygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon/status/1513907792117403649), where we can do a shared analysis on the network usage, then commit to purchasing enough klimadao credits to make the network carbon neutral.

As we proposed earlier in the year,  this would also be a good strategy for the [wrapped Bitcoin](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/earth-bitcoin-an-idea-for-btc-integration/8624). But generally we are happy to support this initiative from a product/design/engineering standpoint if approved.

Hello! I recently read the internet computer footprint blog post on devpost.

Is that project part of this proposal, or independent of it? Unless I missed it, it doesn’t seem to account for scope 2/3 emissions.

So scope 1 would be how much energy the Internet Computer consumes directly. Scope 2 would also include the energy consumed by all the datacentres that connect to it (is this known?) and similar externalities, scope 3 would take account of the embodied carbon and full lifecycle of both what it takes to create and what it takes to consume the IC.

My other question is whether the roadmap includes emissions reductions as well as offsets? And do you take account of other impacts like water use in your servers, land use, etc?

Are these areas you're exploring? Do you have a Chief Sustainability Officer or the like in the roadmap? 

Green software and the sustainable web is my area of expertise, so I'd be happy to get more involved.

Hi @Leamsi! Thanks a lot for the questions. We are still doing a lot of exploration on this topic, but let me try to answer as best I can for now. 

The blogpost you mention is from Carbon Crowd. Originally they were not part of addressing the proposal, but since they made that post we've been working closely together, notably:
* They share their knowledge and experience with us about industry standards and modeling estimations
* We'll share with them any public metrics that we can, and precise node measurements so that they (and we) can obtain more accurate estimations. 

It's been a super nice collaboration so far. Wrt the scope, we are still exploring how to get the best estimates, what information is publicly available, and what information _can_ be made publicly available if we ask for/tune it.

I don't want to speak on behalf of Carbon Crowd (but I'll share your post with them so that they can respond) but wrt roadmap and emission reduction, this is also an ongoing conversation, and one which we are open and excited about, but again still trying to figure the scope of what can be done and how quickly. 

Just yesterday we had a discussion about how to communicate updates and progress on this topic, so I'll be sure to fill you in here as they come. 

The main update so far has appeared in [the wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_performance_%26_power_consumption). I know these are not the most precise answers, but at least an update to let you know that we're consistently working on this topic.

-------------------------

Leamsi | 2022-07-27 22:44:42 UTC | #45

Thank you so much for a fantastic and encouraging response.  It sounds like there are sincere efforts going on in the background. I'd share that there is a huge amount of experience built on tracking datacentre emissions, by people like the Green Web Foundation who have a directory of hosts in the millions, maybe even billions, which they rate as green or not in accordance with a methodology you can find on their site. There are also examples like cloud carbon footprint which focuses on the Big Three (AWS, GCP, Azure). Look at the appendix of their methodology to see the metrics they use.

Given the stated goal of ICP is to have tens of thousands of datacentres asap, this will prove to be, along with governance and wealth concentration, the strategic make or break for ICP in the next 3-5 years. Again, happy to help if you want a critical friend with expertise and networks in this area.

Last question! Are there any plans to create a C-level, or C-level reporting sustainability role at Dfinity? Without such strategic leadership, I think it will be hard to rise to the challenge, and by the time it is a pain point, it will likely be too late to course correct.

Again, thanks a lot for engaging!

I come bearing gifts: [A report](https://assets.carboncrowd.io/reports/ICF.pdf) detailing the computation of the carbon footprint of the IC, and a nice summary blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/dfinity/internet-computer-footprint-assessing-ic-energy-consumption-and-sustainability-4a4dcf10707a). I will also keep part of my role on the topic, so there'll be more to follow soon!

There is a large conservative community of investors in ICP. I don’t think that ratifying beliefs, climate goals, ESG targets, or anything like this does anything but alienate a portion of the community in exchange for some “good guy” points in more liberal settings.

I want this project to make money for me. Convince me that this is good for my wallet, ceteris paribus. If your argument is that the “good guy” points will translate into profits, show me your calculations.

Absolutely love this!! Massive congrats on a job well done. Might want to look at the new Software Carbon Intensity Specification released by the Green Software Foundation and on track to become an ISO standard. I think it will become the main metric in the field, and is compatible with your research.

Hello, 

We continued work on this topic and next week will have a chat about things we feel address the requests in @icpjesse's original proposal. 

If you're in Zürich, drop by and join us at the office to listen in and grab some snacks. [RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sustainability-round-table-viewing-party-dfinity-hq-tickets-611211127937). 

We'll also be streaming online, so you can [join us on Zoom](https://dfinity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_1p4ehHaLTO2eVtCxq1C7Jw). 

It would be great to see you there. We feel that we've now set the foundations as a first step in starting a serious long-term conversation about this topic, and we'd love your input and expertise. 🌱
