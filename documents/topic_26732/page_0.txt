Hello ICP Community!

We completed the final milestone of our grant last year but we never got the chance to showcase to you our product and ask for feedback.

Alphaday is a powerful crypto workflow aggregator that pulls in news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI. Check out the Dfinity/ICP board we built for you here: https://app.alphaday.com/b/dfinity/.

*The board is completely free to use and our goal is to make it as easy as possible to stay up to date with all things ICP. We’d love to hear your thoughts on it. Is there anything you’d like us to add or remove? Any likes/dislikes? Your feedback would be greatly appreciated!*

Very cool

Im not sure if this is the direction you were going but I have really been needing some sort of place to consume social media, blogs and updates from websites in one place for the IC. Essentially like an RSS feed. But Im not sure the capabilities of other sites/services on the IC right now. 
Its just so hard to know whats going on using Taggr, DSCVR, Mora, etc... because you have to go from app to app. All i see is Mora having an rss xml for each of their blogs like: https://mora.news/rss/a46fs-ryaaa-aaaan-qdcyq-cai

Non-trivial feature, but just putting it out there. Would be great for consuming media other than twitter and Medium
