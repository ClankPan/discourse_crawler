Hi everyone

I'd like to give a quick update on the Identity and Authentication working group because there have been some changes since the last session:

1. In order to increase transparency and to provide an easier way to participate, we have moved the working group discussions to [GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication). There will still be monthly discussions via Zoom, but the agenda will be based on the topics and issues in the GitHub repository.
2. We have launched the discussion about interoperability with respect to identity. If you have ideas, concerns, requirements or any other input on that topic, please participate in the discussion by either raising issues, adding comments or / and of course attending the [next session on October 4](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Identity_%26_Authentication).

    * [Discussion about requirements](https://github.com/dfinity/wg-identity-authentication/issues/5)
3. There are also discussions going on related to other topics, i.e. mobile integration and cross-device authentication.

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. Feedback is welcome, either here or on GitHub.

Best regards,
Frederik
