The current structure of the Internet Computer NNS entails risks that require attention by the IC community. The current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to i) attract sufficient new participants to offset the dissolving stakes of current participants, ii) encourage current participants to remain committed long term to the IC, iii) address conflict-of-interest risks that may prevent the IC from executing its mission long term. We have published an article that explores those risks and proposes a solution with the intent of driving a community conversation and executing an NNS proposal for vote.

This article provides a detailed analysis of the problem and the proposed solution: https://medium.com/@wpbartlett/the-current-state-of-governance-of-the-internet-computer-and-proposals-for-tokenomics-improvements-8d51e0a9c6eb

We believe the two changes identified below are worth a formal motion proposal in the NNS to enable a proper vote to see if a majority of voting power agrees. While there are many ideas that can incentivize long term staking, this proposal is focused on ideas that are actionable in an immediate time frame. The primary objective is for 90 percent of the total supply of ICP to be locked in neurons and to incentivize neuron owners to make their dissolve periods as high as possible, which are objectives identified in the tokenomics white paper published by Dfinity prior to the genesis launch.

**Proposed Change #1: Increase the Maximum Dissolve Delay Bonus**

The change that will be proposed is to increase the maximum dissolve delay bonus to 8x. The changes to the NNS governance that would be necessary to accomplish this task are shown below.

let d_stake = stake + ((stake * 7 * d) / (MAX_DISSOLVE_DELAY_SECONDS as u128));
assert!(d_stake <= 8 * stake);

**Proposed Change #2: Increase the Maximum Age Bonus and Reduce the Time to Reach It**

The change that will be proposed is to increase the maximum age bonus to 2x and to reduce the accumulation period for the age bonus to 6 months. The changes to the NNS governance that would be necessary to accomplish this task are shown below.

pub const MAX_NEURON_AGE_FOR_AGE_BONUS: u64 = 1/2*ONE_YEAR_SECONDS;
let ad_stake = d_stake + ((d_stake * a) / (MAX_NEURON_AGE_FOR_AGE_BONUS as u128));
assert!(ad_stake <= (2 * d_stake));

If this proposal passes, the voting reward yield distribution would change according to the blue trend in the graph below. The voting reward yield distribution based on the current dissolve delay bonus and age bonus parameters is shown in the red trend. The data in this chart is based on dissolve delay configuration and age of existing neurons identified by ic.rocks. A spreadsheet is linked in the references of the article that can be downloaded and reviewed. The spreadsheet is structured so each of the parameters highlighted in yellow can be modified to model alternate scenarios.

![|624x468](upload://6KuBxKdncrBYTZ7VDqk5BzVhkoV.png)

It is worth emphasizing that none of the parameter changes in this proposal would affect the total voting reward inflation schedule of ICP. The parameters in question only change the distribution of the voting rewards among the neurons in the NNS as weighted by voting power. It should also be pointed out that these proposed changes would not discriminate between genesis or non-genesis neurons or the amount of ICP staked in neurons: if a neuron owner is committed to long term participation in IC governance, then they would be rewarded in proportion. Based on current staking strategies, most neurons would have a decrease in voting reward yield if this proposal passes. Neurons with the longest dissolve delays and not dissolving would have an increase in voting reward yields. There is nothing keeping anyone from changing their staking strategy in order to achieve the greatest voting rewards if this proposal is adopted.

A time period of one week will be provided for deliberation on this proposal in the forum. The final days will be used to wait for quiet on the deliberation. If new, insightful, and actionable comments continue in those final days, then the deliberation period will be extended. Otherwise, seven days after making the forum post the formal NNS proposal will be made on this topic. The exact content of that proposal will be shaped by the ideas presented in this article as well as actionable feedback that occurs during deliberation as long as they move staking performance closer to the 90% goal and can incentivize maximization of dissolve delay.

No matter how this vote turns out, our hope is that this proposal generates a high level of participation among IC stakeholders, translating into significant active voter turnout, and ultimately resulting in the IC community collectively learning something useful about decentralized governance on the IC. Please encourage participation in this process. Please vote to Approve or Reject according to what you believe is best for long term governance of the IC. Please add your comments to this forum post so others will know your opinion. Thank you for your participation.

Regarding the proposal that mention the current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to i) attract sufficient new participants to offset the dissolving stakes of current participants, ii) encourage current participants to remain committed long term to the IC, I do not see the problem is on the delay & age bonus multiplier (looks fair to me), but I do see the problem is on the requirement of minimum  ICP can be spawned. (1 ICP right now). 

This minimum requirement while not an issue for early contributors that have more than 10k ICP on average, but this is an issue and discourage new small stakers because it need at least 100 ICP ($4500 as current ICP price) to have a reasonable liquidity to spawn the reward at least once monthly.  

To be more inclusive and attract small stakers, I think, minimum requirement for spawning need to be reduced 80-90%.

mechaquan | 2021-11-18 10:00:35 UTC | #4

Hi guys, great write-up!  Of course, I would be in favour however I see two issues:

1) as you mentioned most of the neurons that would be negatively impacted hold a significant majority of the voting power…if they are currently not interested in the long-term staking would this be enough to persuade?  Otherwise they are voting against there own best interests…

2) the biggest issue I see and would like to see addressed is how to get more people to stake period…if there are people who are weary of staking for 8 years now and our currently thinking of only staking for 6 months to 2 years then this will potentially push them away.

I think it would be great to balance the proposal to try and get more people staking, even if it’s short-term, as well as rewarding long-term stakers in a more progressive and proportional way.

Virtually all other cryptos are offering at least a 5% apr for short-term limited lockup staking.  Maybe this could balance the proposal.  Attract short-term stakers by offering a reward/apr% on limited lockup staking for less than 6 months with no governance/voting rights.  Actually I would like to see governance protected by moving voting rights to > 1year dissolve delay with a nominal apr % below that.

Just my two cents…

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-11-18 10:03:36 UTC | #5

I think this is more a technical problem than something that has been decided to disadvantage smaller stakers. If you reduce that limit someone could spam the NNS with a lot of small neurons. 

It would be interesting to know however why you have to spawn a new 7 day neuron instead of just instantly disbursing to an ICP address.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-11-18 11:06:16 UTC | #6

Currently, neurons get no voting rewards for the final 6 months in which they are dissolving, this means that if you stake for 1 year, you may be getting ~10% APR at first, but overall you only end up with ~5% due to only receiving rewards half of the time.

This already incentivises people to stake for long durations and deters people who want to just give it a try.

I think this proposed changed will exacerbate this problem.

Instead, we should reduce that final window during which no rewards are given to be ~2 weeks.

This way people can give staking a try for 2-3 months and get fairly decent returns which I think will encourage far more people into the system.

The rewards are already high enough for those of us who stake for 8 years, I think increasing these rewards further will do more harm than good by driving newcomers away and driving more power to those who are already heavily invested in the project.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2021-11-18 11:36:38 UTC | #7

Yes agree on giving staking rewards for short-term stakers but I’d be against allowing governance rights…that’s a huge risk.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 13:34:40 UTC | #8

As a fellow 8 Year Gang member I want to express my appreciation to @wpb , @Kyle_Langham , and @ayjayem for writing this article and putting together this proposal. I think we will have some great discussion spawn from this.

To that end; I wanted to summarize my takeaways from your article and share my perspective. 

**Facts:**

1. There is more ICP leaving the NNS than being staked
2. A majority of neurons have a short ( < 4 years) Dissolve Delay (DD)
3. A majority of Seed Investor & Early Contributor neurons are being dissolved

**Assumptions:**

1. Neurons are being dissolved because voting rewards don't provide enough incentive to "lock-up" 
2. Seed Investors & Early Contributor neurons being dissolved must be a sign that these individuals have lost faith in the IC and might be a security threat.


**My Opinion:**
There are a lot of factors that can influence a person's decision to stake in the NNS. Voting rewards are only one of those factors. Several individuals I've spoken to don't participate in NNS governance because they aren't confident it will still be around in 8 years. The IC is considered unproven technology; if we're being honest, that is probably justified.

I can understand why individuals who choose to stake in the NNS have chosen to dissolve their neurons. It's another form of risk management. Sure, if you let the neuron dissolve over the next 4 years you will lose out on max rewards. But, let's say 4 years from now the IC is on it's last leg and because you let your neuron dissolve you can now exit your position with some amount of money. The person who locked-up is completely out of luck.

Alternatively, let's say you get to the end of your dissolve period (or even just a year out) and you realize the IC is taking off and will likely be a success. Well, no problem, let's just go move that DD slider to the right and fully commit this neuron to a life of luxury.

My point being that just because someone has a neuron dissolving today does not mean it will always be that way. In fact, given the volatility of the crypto industry I think it's completely reasonable for people to manage their risk in this way. I think this is especially true for Seed Investors & Early Contributors who have already waited years (far longer than any of us) to earn their rewards.

**Proposed Alternative:**
1. Remove the proposal to increase rewards for 8 year neurons. I don't think this will be effective and it only serves a small group of dedicated IC enthusiasts who are already willing to take the risk (myself included).

2. Keep the proposal for increasing the MAX_AGE bonus and reducing the time to reach it. I think this will be far more effective at getting people to stay locked and it is also applicable to all neurons; not just 8 year stakers.

Edit:  I realize I did not address the issue of investor confidence. I don't think that's something we can address with a governance proposal. There is a lot of great work being done by Dfinity and the developer community. It's my belief that we just need more time to see interest grow. As long as the core developers and app developers continue to find common ground on proposals I think we'll be fine.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 13:54:17 UTC | #9

I agree with the general point made by both @hpeebles and @mechaquan. We should be trying to further incentivize staking across the entire DD range. (6 mos. - 8 years). 

For security reasons I do not agree with reducing the minimum lockup from 6 mos. However, I would not be against a proposal to continue rewarding neurons that are dissolving during that 6 month period. A neuron that is dissolving w/ less than 6 mos. should not be allowed to vote anymore but it could still be rewarded a smaller amount until it is fully dissolved.

The question is why would we reward a neuron that isn't voting? What are they being rewarded for?

That's a good question and maybe we can build a condition into the system that says you can only be provided rewards if this neuron has a minimum history of voting. That way someone can't just create a new neuron, immediately start dissolving, and then get rewards.

Would love to hear others thoughts on this.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 14:07:11 UTC | #10

I am in favor of this proposal. The most involved ones must be prioritized, for the wellness of the IC ecosystem. We can't afford rejection of proposals like BTC Integration, everyone want it, be we could have seen this one rejected with the present tokenomics. This risk must be definitely suppressed. Let's imagine the rejection of ETH integration. We must reform this.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-11-18 14:56:55 UTC | #11

How about if rewards stay as they are now but voting power scales linearly with lock up period?

That way we could give neurons rewards right down until they become liquid, but the overall control is still massively weighted towards those that lock up for 8 years.

I know that currently rewards == voting power, but that could be changed if needed.

-------------------------

Fulco | 2021-11-18 16:36:04 UTC | #12

I think it would be helpful to know how the foundation decided on the current parameters. There has never been a publication explaining how these were decided.

I don't know why it wouldn't scale linearly with time. Eight years is an eternity in crypto and 16x times as long as 6 months why would you only get 2x times the voting power and rewards for taking such a massive gamble? (note: I'm a bit biased because I have an 8 year neuron) 

Alternatively I would also be down for a **forever neuron** one that you can never dissolve, but has a far higher voting power. 

Also no matter what I would like this motion proposal to be made. I would be very interested in seeing how many people would vote manually for this motion proposal when it affects their own rewards.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 16:57:18 UTC | #13

Totally agree for a Forever Neuron ! But I think it implies legality problems. Currently, the forever neuron bonus is the bonus age never lost.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 16:58:15 UTC | #14

It would be a good start at least !

-------------------------

joydna | 2021-11-18 17:39:50 UTC | #15

The proposal is much improving the current NNS rewarding mechanism, however the updated scheme still let those early retail investors, who spent a couple of hundred per icp staked for 8 yrs in early days, they are the true icp supporters, but they still looks stupid by means tokenomics.

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2021-11-18 17:43:12 UTC | #16

Could you please make simple Google Sheets that we can enter whatever our stakes and time? (8 years or two years locked with x amount of dissolving etc.)  It can show side by side if the proposal is accepted or not. Sometimes too much information is more confusing than helping. Or post simple scenarios like eight years locked with eight years dissolving will gain or lose this if proposal accepted! If you want to keep to conversations with nerds only, great work so far.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 17:44:48 UTC | #17

I agree it would be nice if the foundation chimed in. I've asked many times and stopped hoping for a response. I'm not sure if I'm asking the right person, or if the right person even works at Dfinity.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 18:09:16 UTC | #18

@wpb, I agree : I think a board presentation, sendable in one picture on twitter, would be hugely efficient ! Don't you ?

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 18:32:01 UTC | #19

That is crazy to think that the 8 years stakers don't even receive 2 times the rewards of 6 months stakers. All is said. We have to solve this problem, for the wellness of the Ecosystem. Or the shorters can't have such a power, or they can't have such rewards.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-18 19:38:07 UTC | #20

Does this help?  Below are two examples to help you understand how to read the chart.

For an 8 year dissolve delay and 3 month neuron age, the VRY is approx 29% with the current tokenonics parameters.  That same neuron would get 38% VRY immediately if the tokenomics parameters in this proposal were approved and it would grow to 51% VRY within 3 months (see Note).

For a 4 year dissolve delay and the neuron is dissolving (0 age), the VRY is approx 22% with the current tokenomics parameters.  That same neuron would get 14% VRY if the tokenomics parameters in this proposal were approved.  However, if they stop dissolving and leave the neuron at 4 year dissolve delay, then the VRY would grow to 28% within 6 months (see Note).

With the current tokenomics parameters (red), almost all post genesis neurons show up as noise on the lower line because the max age bonus accumulation time is so long and the max age bonus is so small.  With the proposed tokenomics parameters (blue), the post genesis neurons show up as a wide VRY distribution range for each dissolve delay.

Note: Anything that is successful at increasing governance participation in significant ways will result in future rewards that are lower than the theoretical max based on governance participation today.  It is always difficult to forward project the governance rewards for this reason.  The further out you try to project the less accurate the projection might be.  I have been staking for 6 months now and I can confirm that my governance rewards have been very consistent throughout this time period at 29%.  However, this proposal is intended to move the needle by increasing governance participation.

aSpace1 | 2021-11-18 19:10:16 UTC | #21

Thank you so much but even simpler form, post into Twitter and other places, for most of us simple is better to move forward! Remember, given how advanced is the Internet Computer vs others yet the responses are nowhere near what they deserve ( Because most don't understand the full potential)! I will vote yes!

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 19:18:22 UTC | #22

We put this in a board and it is done ! 

« For an 8 year dissolve delay and 3 month neuron age, the VRY is approx 29% with the current tokenonics parameters. That same neuron would get 38% VRY if the tokenomics parameters in this proposal were approved.

For a 4 year dissolve delay and the neuron is dissolving (0 age), the VRY is approx 22% with the current tokenomics parameters. That same neuron would get 14% VRY if the tokenomics parameters in this proposal were approved. However, if they stop dissolving and leave the neuron at 4 year dissolve delay, then the VRY would grow to 28% within 6 months »

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 19:41:20 UTC | #23

I'm hesitant to jump on board with this. If I'm understanding @wpb explanation correctly it would seem like short-term stakers (4 years isn't really 'short' IMO) are being undervalued by this proposal.

Edit: Perhaps I'm missing the intent of this proposal. Are we trying to increase participation in NNS governance or are we trying to improve distribution of rewards? I think both are valid problems.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 19:50:56 UTC | #24

Can you provide those same numbers in the case where 90% staking is achieved?

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 20:09:12 UTC | #25

Both in same time yes ! By implication.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 20:12:15 UTC | #26

Hmm. I’m not sure we achieve both with this. I think reducing rewards for shorter lockups might have the opposite effect. Either people will stake less, or they won’t stake at all. 

We might see an increase in the number of 8 year neurons but I doubt it would be enough to offset the amount of ICP leaving the NNS.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 20:14:21 UTC | #27

The target is to convince everyone to stake for 8 years, cause they will think : I will very quickly double my ICP.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 20:15:24 UTC | #28

But I understand your point @LightningLad91
Still, I am really afraid decisions like BTC would not pass cause of the current tokenomics.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-18 20:17:50 UTC | #29

That’s fair. But we have to remember that the 3% rule only goes into effect if the voting period ends without a majority. I find it unlikely that Dfinity or any other major stakeholder would allow something like that to just happen without voting against it.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-19 06:14:02 UTC | #30

Yes, unfortunately, I agree. We must spread everywhere the new rewardings if the proposal passes. People will do the math and will join the 8 year gang rather than keeping staking for 4 years with current rate. We just need a board to spread through all the socials.

-------------------------

hpeebles | 2021-11-18 21:21:23 UTC | #31

It has to be worthwhile to stake for short durations otherwise everyone will either be fully invested and stake for 8 years or not stake at all.

If the proposed change is made, far less of the total supply will be staked into neurons because only a minority of people will want to stake for 8 years, but staking for anything shorter will have tiny returns, so people will opt to keep their ICP liquid.

I think getting a return of 20-25% for locking up for 8 years is incentive enough for those of us who believe in the project. While a return of 10% is enough for it to still be worthwhile to stake for a short duration. So I don't think the rewards should be changed. But I do agree that people whose neurons are locked for 8 years should have more voting power than they currently do, so I stand by my earlier suggestion that voting power should be linear with lock up duration and rewards should stay as they are.

I think that solves all the issues people have mentioned + has the added bonus of safely allowing people to stake for < 6 months because their votes will have very little weight.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-11-18 21:23:20 UTC | #32

There are data size attacks to consider here. It is likely that 1ICP was chosen so that an attacker doesn't buy 4500 ICP, stake them all individually and spawn as often as possible. There are still data concerns with the IC and upgrade cycles limits, etc.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2021-11-18 21:27:44 UTC | #33

My first impression is to agree with this. If you want to increase participation in staking you need to shift the whole curve up.  I currently think the returns on ICP are more than fair and we're simply due for a market awakening that you can get a 15% return on an amazing asset by just staking one year.  Maybe 20% looks more attractive?  You could shift the whole curve up by 5% and see what happens.  Lowering what 6-month stakers get may lead to a reduction in the percentage staked.  I'm only an amateur economist though so I'm happy to be convinced otherwise.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 22:04:20 UTC | #34

So we have to consider now disadvantages and benefits of both enhancement : the @wpb, @Kyle_Langham and @ayjayem’s one on one hand, the @hpeebles on the other hand, and work from here to choose one of them or a third one mixing their good points or a brand new one. But let us maintain alive the brainstorming !

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-18 22:06:28 UTC | #35

Maybe the third one is this one ! @wpb, @hpeebles, your opinions ?

[/quote]

I totally agree with @LightningLad91. By punishing shorter lockups, will make ICP less attractive for some participants (either small stakers or big stakers). They won't bother to stake, or they decide not to participate to the NNS governance at all. Some participants choose different dissolve delay time for risk management and their risk tolerance. Consider, that not all ICP participants are ICP maximalist.

We should be careful for steepening the reward yield curve as proposed by this proposal.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2021-11-19 01:59:55 UTC | #37

If reward spawning required certain fee, does it discourage attackers to spam the nns ?

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2021-11-19 02:17:24 UTC | #38

The 15% reward for just staking one year is already good enough in my opinion. If the reward need to be increased proportionally across the DD range, it should be implemented once more use cases from ICP projects start to take off, and demand for ICP increases dramatically. 

If we increase the reward yield curve now, it will only increase the supply of ICP that currently struggle to be absorbed by the market (thus will depress the ICP price lower)

-------------------------

llbrunoll | 2021-11-19 02:09:18 UTC | #39

Hi @Fulco and @skilesare. Considering what both of you said, maybe we could 1) keep the 1 ICP requirement to spawn a new neuron, to avoid data size attacks, and 2) include an option to transfer any amount of stake rewards directly to the main (or any) wallet address (that could be restricted to 1 transfer/day). 

Result: Small amounts of ICP stake-rewards (smaller than 1 ICP) could be transferable to an ICP address (no need to spawn a neuron and dissolve it).

(doubts: What is the reason for requiring the user to spawn a new neuron, and then dissolve it, to collect stake-rewards? Why we can't directly transfer the rewards? Is there something related to 'newly minted coins' that avoid a direct transfer of stake-rewards?)

-------------------------

vger | 2021-11-19 07:21:51 UTC | #40

If the proposal is indeed intended to attract new investors, I am afraid it would achieve exactly the opposite. Not only that, I am certain that many current stakers would leave.  8 years and even 4 years is a very long time in crypto, especially if you are forced into the decision. The proposal seems to benefit only particular group of stakers, everybody else will be at loss.  ​

What I would do is give more freedom to investors and with that show more trust and confidence in the product. 

I think the 2nd part of proposal alone (Increase the Maximum Age Bonus and Reduce the Time to Reach It) would actually be enough to achieve the intended goal. It would encourage investors to keep their dissolve times locked and still give them enough freedom and risk management options.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-19 10:19:35 UTC | #41

You all have to know that as 8 years stakers, people (I am one of them) don’t stake for 8 years thinking they will wait 8 years to take back their investment, but thinking they will take it back regularly (each day for big investors, monthly for less big, weekly for less big again, etc.) during 3 years and even before if the ICP price increases, they think « I will never dissolve, I will use the amount staked as a motor to generate passive incomes all the rest of my life, and if ICP price increases, maybe before one year, I would have taken back all my initial investment ! ». 

So, paradoxically, it is not necessarily ICP Maximalist who stake for 8 years. At the early beginning, in my own case, I thought : « in less than 3 years, I will have disburse the same amount initially invested, plus, I will keep my initial amount as motor ». Now, the truth is, I don’t disburse anything, cause I became ICPM. But here is the real difference between an ICPM and a non ICPM : disburse or not, the difference is not in the 8 years dissolve delay choice. 

With such a rate of rewards, we will make more people think like this, and we will protect the NNS & ICP. Facilitate this way of thinking is the @wpb’s idea, I think.

[/quote]

No clue. Unless DFN was advised that there was some tax advantage of it going into a neuron instead of an ICP address it seems like a wasted(and inconvenient step). For ICDevs I have to redistribute a bunch of 1ICP Neurons constantly.  It will be a lot more fun when ICP is at $2000 per ICP because it takes about an hour a week to manage it all. :joy:

-------------------------

llbrunoll | 2021-11-19 15:56:10 UTC | #43

Maybe this is because the stake-rewards that are show as Maturity, are not yet minted coins. Maybe (not sure) when we "merge maturity" or "spawn a new neuron" we are minting coins. 

If that is the case, maybe this could be automated: When the user choose to transfer Maturity into his Main Wallet, a neuron is automatically spawn and dissolved (even if Maturity turns into less than 1 ICP), and the rewards may reach the main wallet in seven day (the time needed for the dissolve delay).

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-19 15:29:08 UTC | #44

The DD for spawned neurons is 7 days, not 1.

Well done on the deep dive into current neuron staking and dissolving dynamics. I think the most relevant action item is to shorten the length of time required to hit the maximum age bonus as this would appreciably incentive anyone to stay staked regardless of their chosen dissolve delay.

I disagree with the remaining conclusions and action items though for the following reason: I see the biggest threat to the longevity of the internet computer as centralization. The proposal being debated here has been built with the assumption that the biggest threat to the internet computer is a lack of long-term token holders and falling short of having 90% ICP staked. If this proposal were to work as envisioned, then some of the relatively few pre-genesis stake holders would be incentivized into creating 8 year neurons, and the rest would stay the course to cashing in their already long and profitable investment (I have heard it is in the neighborhood of 1000x or 100x, but I don't know that for a fact). I don't think it's worth it to incentive someone to take on even more risk when they have already enjoyed such a strong return.

I wonder if some of the unspoken assumptions built into the proposal surrounds protecting the short-term price of ICP from pre-genesis neurons dissolving and hitting the market. In the long-term, these concerns do not matter, because the long-term driver of ICP price is usage of the internet computer. In fact, short-term price deflation of ICP I think would help further decentralize the NNS and lead to greater health.

I hope to post more numbers later of what 90% ICP staking would do to the rewards vs the current, because they will drop significantly (splitting the reward pie into 9/5 more pieces), but my initial guess is the 8 year neurons would be marginally better (32% or so) and the lower dissolve delays be much less than current levels. I agree with other posters that the goal is not to make everyone stake for 8 years, but incentivize them to stake for whatever time/risk works for them, especially in such a fast-paced space where years feel more like decades.

Wenzel @wpb , Kyle  @Kyle_Langham  , Alex @ayjayem 
Seems that there is about 25% ICP staked and not dissolving right now. (about 120m)
Can you tell me why we need or wish 90% staking?
What is the goal to increase the staking?
What problem do we have now that more staking would resolve?
I think the answer is to help to  higher the ICP price but want make sure before I go forward with my view.

We attempted to provide answers to these questions in the abstract and introduction sections of the article.  The arguments we made are based on the state and momentum of governance, not ICP price.  I encourage you to read the article for our detailed analysis, problem statement, and proposed solution.  

We really appreciate when folks offer their opinions during this deliberation.  We made a very specific proposal for a change to solve the problems we identified and we are hopeful that responses that are of a differing opinion will include suggestions that are 1) actionable (e.g. is there a code update that can be readily identified and included in the proposal) and 2) address the stated problems of too much dissolving on the NNS and the risks of conflict-of-interest.

I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

jzxchiang | 2021-11-19 23:03:04 UTC | #50

Somewhat tangential, but as an 8-year staker, I honestly kinda wished there wasn't a distinction between "dissolving" and "non-dissolving".

It means that my ICP is locked up for longer than 8 years, and I have to make a conscious decision to start dissolving, which is a decision that's not easy to make...

I have no idea if I'd prefer to get my initial ICP stake back in 8 years or 9 years or 8.3451 years... they all sound pretty distant to me...

-----

Some random thoughts...

* I'm not really worried about "nefarious neurons" who can execute bad governance proposals in order to drive up the short-term ICP price at the expense of the long-term health of the IC. Since 99.99% of us follow DFINITY, their proposals wouldn't pass.
* I'm much more worried about general apathy. We're not at the stage where we need to worry about bad actors (like a Bitcoin or Ethereum); we're at the stage where we should worry about nobody knowing or caring about the IC. The truth is there are plenty of L1 blockchains and L2 rollups out there, and most people have no idea what the IC is.

Whether apathy is the result of low staking rewards or not I'm not sure. My guess is no. If someone came up to you and told you you could earn 25% APY, you'd probably look at them with skepticism. If they came back to you and told you you could instead earn 30% APY, I don't think you would change your mind. Marketing, building great dapps... these are the things that will move the needle.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-11-19 23:05:03 UTC | #51

Also, I'm not a fan of increasing the age bonus so much (from 1.25x to 2x).

It means that as soon as you click the "dissolve" button, your neuron's age goes to zero and you lose half of your rewards. For an 8-year staker like myself, that's a huge drop.

Maybe a neuron's age bonus should decrease over time once it starts dissolving, instead of losing it all immediately?

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-11-19 23:27:43 UTC | #52

I did read (twice) before I asked my questions.  Also, want say, just like you, I have bought my ICP after genesis last may and have them all lock in 8 years as well.
Although the whitepaper stated that 90% of ICP should be staked, it does not say that if there is less, problems will arise.  They did not said it would be a problem to have less.  So, beside to have a low price pressure for few years, I do not see the problem with having less then 90% ICP staked.  On top, Dfinity have always stated they will make sure they have less than 50% of voting power then the community to avoid control.
Also, Dfinity have never explained clearly why they assumed 90% should be locked.  They never explained what they taught could happen if less are staked.  Unless I missed the explanation.

If you see one problem with less then 90%, or I misread your document (sorry English is my second language), your are welcome to share with me.

So may be I can asked different way:  What can harm IC if less then 90% of ICP were staked, other then the price?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-19 23:43:56 UTC | #53

I’m a bit confused. Doesn’t the age bonus already drop to 0 the moment you hit dissolve?

Edit: never mind I realize what you’re saying now. I don’t see the downside tho. Unless you just can’t make up your mind about dissolving 😉

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-11-19 23:50:05 UTC | #54

Same as me, I thought his proposal was about the needle (price).  @wpb have clearly stated to me that the proposal is not to move the needle up.
*"The arguments we made are based on the state and momentum of governance, not ICP price"*

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-11-20 00:02:36 UTC | #55

> However, this proposal is intended to move the needle by increasing governance participation.

Well, I did see this hahah

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-11-20 00:22:32 UTC | #56

Yeah...just found the needle within one of @wpb post. But the needle was not mentioned in the medium release.
I am confused now...
Intended to move the needle or not?
I am 100% with you @jzxchiang .  IC needle should be move with apps, marketing, and new unique stuff.
No body cares if front end are on blockchain or not.  Criticizing other blockchain will not make IC adoption better. NFT's have lots of competition.  No DEFI yet on IC and lot of competition when it happen.  Will be hard (maybe impossible) to move people from Whatsapp or Twitter which have been proven efficient and reliable. Dfinity host his website on cloud.  Hard to promote to host yours on IC blockchain.
Will need time and a lot of creativity to move the needle, not a stake reward change.
The good news is that I found IC community , Dfinity team and programmers team to be one of the best , if not the best.  
Only my 2 cents though

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-20 00:44:46 UTC | #57

Hey @coteclaude and @jzxchiang I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts and opinions.  I have a high level of respect for what you have to say.  

One detail that seems to have caught your attention was my use of the phrase “move the needle”.  I never used that phrase in the context of ICP price.  That comment was about governance participation.  The goal of the our article and the proposal is to change tokenomics parameters in a way that we believe will move us closer to the objectives outlined by Dfinity in the referenced articles. 

I will try to do a better job of explaining myself so I don’t cause confusion in the future.  My apologies.

aSpace1 | 2021-11-20 02:02:25 UTC | #58

Most of the early investors of Bitcoin got out when they reached 10X, some 100X and some 1000X at $ 30 or 10000x at $300. It is human nature to get out when they are up that much, and I think that is a good thing, if anything. New people will come. The proposal is an excellent proposal to the point it is only fair to have longer investments to have better terms. Perhaps most importantly, the longest staked holder can only have one motivation, IC, to succeed. For a short therm holder, use your imagination. This proposal provides a better foundation for its future.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-20 10:29:40 UTC | #59

Again, I think it is not possible that 8 years stakers don’t even earn 2 times the 6 months stakers’ rewards. With such unfair rates, people are not encouraged to stake 8 years, but 6 months ; incentivize is here non efficient.

Let me be clear : My point is not that 8 years stakers should earn 16 times what earn 6 months stakers, but by making them earn not even 2 times what 6 months stakers earn, the long termism is clearly not incentivized, and consequently, the stability of the ecosystem.

Do we really want to take the risk of seeing the Ethereum integration don’t pass ?

@wpb, if we only set a new correlation between DD and Voting power as @hpeebles recommends it, would it be enough to solve the lack of security ? Or not ?

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2021-11-20 14:39:23 UTC | #60

How to define unfair? I have staked for 8 years and I think for the current rate, it is fair. Keep the current solution is pretty good. Based on the proposal solution, will be more and more ppl unwilling to stake since only few people would like to stake more than 4 years.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-20 12:38:43 UTC | #61

Here is the link to the Google Sheet that is referenced in the article.  It should be view only.  However, if you make a copy then you will be able to change the parameters highlighted in yellow on the Proposal tab to model different scenarios.  There are notes in each cell that describe the parameter.  The VRY Distribution tab will show you an overlay plot of current voting reward yield distribution of the Proposal and the Current so you can see how the distribution will change.

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-20 15:14:07 UTC | #62

If you feel it as fair, how can you feel the 6 months stakers’ rate fair ? And if you feel the 6 months stakers’ rate fair, how can you feel the 8 years stakers’ rate fair ?

Plus, this is not only about rewards here, but about some risks we are exposed to, like the rejection of Ethereum integration, in regard to what happened with Bitcoin integration. You are satisfied by the current rate, but did you see the votes distribution about BTC integration ? If it had been rejected, where would be we right now ?

But many people seem satisfied with current parameters, so it will be probably let like it is. So don’t worry, be happy. Me, I will start to be less involved & to invest elsewhere, precisely because the BTC integration event. In my opinion, a worm is in the fruit, shown in a pretty good way by Wenzel, Kyle & Alex.

Alixthe | 2021-11-20 13:46:40 UTC | #64

Hey @wpb ~ it is great that you have brought this topic up which in its entirety is for the general good of ICP (more so when we are seeing a situation with more neurons dissolving than being staked which ultimately will have an effect on the price of ICP).  

I have only just read your Medium article in its entirety and have also gone through your spreadsheet (I have not performed a verification of the data within the spreadsheet but note that there appears to be less ICP rewards generated by the proposal than the ICP rewards being generated currently ~ although I may have completely misunderstood your table and could simply be a calculation error on my part).

To assist our readers who are short on time, I have prepared a summary on [DSCVR](https://h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai.raw.ic0.app/post/1398840/__proposed-changes-to-incentivize-staking__) so they can have a quick overview of your proposal (I have also included a diagram based on one [prepared by Dfinity previously](https://youtu.be/xVNSxFFAYUo?t=1427)).

Barring any concerns and/or issues (arising from proposed changes) that may highlighted by say a tokenomics specialist, it appears the proposal will surely be in favour of current long term investors (who have staked for 8 years) but may be in doubt for investors who have committed to staking for a lower time frame (notwithstanding that the proposal incentivizes them to staking for longer period).

If there are any errors and/or omissions in my summary, please do not hesitate to include these in the comments section on DSCVR. 

Thanks.

christian | 2021-11-20 14:12:54 UTC | #65

Wenzel, Kyle and Alex: thanks so much for setting an example of how to run a motion proposal! I really enjoyed the write up and the discussed it triggered here. As another 8y neuron holder I'd like to drop my 2 cents here. 

Don't you guys think that it would keep the discussion more focused if the proposal's scope was simpler? E.g. in this one you modify 2 protocol parameters in a non-subtle way. As much as I like your underlying motivation, my entire engineering intuition tells me that this is too risky and the effects are too unpredictable. Especially if thing won't go as expected, it will be hard to reason about which factors contributed to it and to which degree.

The governance system has proven itself so far to be somewhat stable if not sustainable yet. But thinking about all possible scenarios described by others in this thread I kind of can see all of them to be valid: yes, it might help to incentivize more people to invest long-term and yes, it could have the opposite effect so that less ICPs get locked up in general.

Having said this, I really like the idea of reaching the maximal age faster and/or getting more rewards for age (again, maybe not _both_ of them simultaneously). I think non dissolving state should actually be the default state of a neuron. Dissolving makes only sense if you're done investing. According to ic.rocks though, 25% of the ICP supply is in the dissolving neurons. So with the current parameters this incentive is too weak.

Increasing the profitability of an aged neuron would be a single change with an easy to observe KPI. People still could stake for whatever period they are comfortable with but they would be incentivized to let their neuron locked: even if it is a 6 month neuron: rewards get more attractive, but your stake is still only half a year away).

It is easy to see, that the obvious outcome _should_ be the reduction of neurons being dissolved, which indirectly reduces the supply (hopefully those of seeds too). If this does not work out, we could re-evaluate it (obviously in context of the market situation) when we would get the first results.

Obviously, this would require a rework of your proposal, and this decision is completely up to you, but I hope I could at least provide some new insights.

Hi all,

First, thank you very much to this community for entertaining the thoughts from Wenzel, Alex and myself.  I find the community's ability to have dialogue and constructive feedback is one of the strengths of this community.  I know my thoughts on this matter have shifted some due to the group's intelligence and thought-provoking comments.

Wenzel, Alex and myself wanted to get an article out that dives deeper into the concerns we have for the current NNS structure since the original article only skimmed the surface.  You can read that article here: https://kylelangham.substack.com/p/concerns-related-to-nns-participation

Thanks again for this community's commitment!
Kyle

wpb | 2021-11-20 17:44:44 UTC | #67

Thank you for this write up @Alixthe.  I really appreciate that it adds transparency to this proposal because you are right that there are some neurons that will be advantaged and there are other neurons that will be disadvantaged if this proposal is accepted.  I think your analysis on those points is correct. We tried to offer that clarification in the article and we made Figure 9 the thumbnail image for the article and this original forum post because it helps drive that point home.  This transparency is very important and I appreciate you offering your take on the implications.

I only made two comments to your DSCVR post, which is that 1) the proposal is about governance participation instead of ICP price and 2) a caution about trying to forecast reward accumulation as well as voting reward yield into the future.  

Our analysis only presents how voting power and voting reward yield would be affected today if these changes were implemented today.  We didn’t take it further than that because there is so much potential variability and because those forecasts are unpredictable even with the current tokenomics parameters.  Voting reward yield is affected by the amount of total ICP that is staked in the NNS and by the decisions that people make about neuron configuration.  We hope to influence both with this proposal because it will give people a new set of tokenomics parameters to consider.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-20 18:05:51 UTC | #68

@wpb @Kyle_Langham if I’m understanding the original post correctly the deliberation period is coming to an end soon? If that’s true I’m curious if you have decided to make any adjustments to the proposal based on the collective feedback so far?

Thanks

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-23 01:04:13 UTC | #69

The deliberation won't come to an end until Wed evening or Thurs morning at the earliest since we posted the article and started this forum topic on Wed and wanted to have 1 week deliberation (plus wait for quiet).  We have not met yet to determine if any of the comments would change the proposal, but we are listening.  It is especially helpful if comments can be provided that offer actionable alternatives to what we have proposed and move governance participation in a direction that addresses the problems that we have outlined.  Feedback in this forum and on social media is very important as well as putting a proposal before the governing body of the IC for a decision on the merits of what is proposed.

On a personal note, I want to express publicly that I really appreciate all the time and effort you have put into the study of this proposal and offering your comments.  It is really important to have people like you so interested in the integrity of the governance system.  Your vote on this proposal, no matter which way it is cast, is a win for decentralized governance on the IC.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-11-20 18:31:41 UTC | #70

My gosh I can’t believe it’s only been a few days; I feel like I’ve been thinking about this longer than that 🤪. Thanks for everything y’all are doing. This has been a very pleasant discussion to be part of.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-11-20 18:47:36 UTC | #71

After much thinking, I think I like the fact that the seeds and early investors are dissolving their neurons and sell them.  I think the vast majority of long term staker don't care about the price in 2-3 years term. These seeds and early investors have big volumes in their bag as we all know. When they sell, good chances IC get new hundreds new investors for 1 seller.  Don't you think in 2 or 3 years, we may have a much better diversification of ownership and NNS owners?  These new buyers, true believer of IC, would certainly be interested in staking their bags.  Diversification in ownership is key for healthy decentralization and avoid price manipulation.
Maybe patience is the key here...

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2021-11-20 18:53:21 UTC | #72

Would be nice to see if the number of NNS wallet are increasing with the selling....
Is there anyway to know this and follow this within the next few years @Kyle_Langham ?

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-20 19:54:38 UTC | #73

I hope your analysis of 90% ICP staking (the last paragraph in your post) is going well.  An easy way to explore that is to use the spreadsheet linked in the references because it contains all existing known neurons in the columns to the right.  Whatever scenario you want to explore, you could just change the Staked ICP column to values that represent 90% staking.  I'm not sure if you want to see what happens if additional 240M ICP (the amount needed to achieve 90% staking today) is all staked in 8 year neurons, or half in 8 year and half 6 month neurons, or any other combination.  I totally understand if you prefer to build your own spreadsheet, but thought I'd offer this option in case you or others wanted to model these types of scenarios.  You just have to find rows that represent the dissolve delay, neuron age, and dissolve/locked status you want included in the model and then add some proportional amount of Staked ICP to that row.  You can do that on both the Proposal and the Current tabs if you want to compare both scenarios in your analysis.

-------------------------

Alixthe | 2021-11-22 05:01:10 UTC | #74

Thanks for the feedback @wpb.  I have included some clarification on DSCVR regarding both of your comments raised (nothing major and it will not affect any decisions).

Further, no matter how the vote goes, this has been a great way to raise discussion amongst the community for NNS Motion Proposals and should be seen as a template for any future proposals so everyone is included (and by everyone I mean stakeholders on DSCVR, Distrikt, Twitter and any other media channels).

-------------------------

Hi @wpb, let us know when the proposal is up for voting at the NNS. Thank you!

-------------------------

Roman | 2021-11-22 12:43:44 UTC | #76

We will have to vote. But more importantly, we will all have to spread the word on the socials. Otherwise, it will be useless, because meaningless if not enough people vote. So let us be prepared to forward the proposal everywhere, again and again.

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2021-11-22 17:38:40 UTC | #77

Let see how the people vote. I hope they will vote Yes. I am voting Yes when the proposal comes! One thing that may further improve that if
Community Fund Neurons
have even higher voting power. Perhaps it can be done in the future if the proposal is adopted.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-11-22 19:57:08 UTC | #78

After having some time to hear the debate and scrutinize the arguments, I think the proposal essentially simplifies down to this:
1) Do you think the internet computer is better off if longer-term neurons get a bigger voting and rewards bonus than they currently do?
2) Are the benefits of tweaking the voting/rewards algorithm worth the risks?

If you answer "yes" to both questions, then vote "yes" for the proposal.
If you answer "no" to one or both, then vote "no". 
I answer "yes" to both, so will be voting "yes".

-------------------------

BenTaylor | 2021-11-22 20:27:19 UTC | #79

My biggest concern with changing the voting rewards is that people staked their ICP with the expectation that the old reward system would remain in place. Imagine, for example, that you staked your ICP for one year because you were told that your ICP would yield 15+% in that year. Now, after you already staked your ICP and cannot undo your decision, you are told that you're now going to earn less than half of that. That seems rather unfair to those people. Moreover, it might open the dfinity foundation up to a lawsuit. It would not surprise me if some opportunistic lawyers filed a class action against dfinity on behalf of neuron holders, arguing that dfinity failed to disclose that neuron rewards could be changed by vote--or that dfinity fraudulently promoted high yields for short-term stakers.

Edit: Full disclosure, both of my neurons are 8-year neurons.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-11-22 20:33:45 UTC | #80

# TLDR

I think the decision to vote yes or no on this proposal comes down to answering the following two questions:

1. Will the changes in dissolve delay bonus and age bonus result in better tokenomics and voting power distribution over the long term?
2. If the answer to question 1 is yes, then is the risk of implementing these changes given the current state of the network worth the reward from the better tokenomics and voting power distribution?

Personally I am convinced that the answer to question 1 is yes. The design does seem to be superior to the current design in certain ways.

My personal answer to question 2...I am not sure.

In subsequent replies I will address various aspects of the proposal and my view on them.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-11-22 20:40:06 UTC | #81

# Risk

There is risk in implementing these changes, with possibly unforeseen consequences. I do not believe that all of the reasons given in the article for changing the bonuses are compelling or even correct, though I do agree that the design more favorably distributes rewards and voting power to those willing to commit long-term.

So for me it comes down to this: should we be messing with a system that is working well enough? I do not see any compelling evidence showing that changes to tokenomics and voting power distribution will lead to more long-term stakers in the short-term, nor materially address the voting power of the genesis group of stakers (I believe the concentrated number of genesis participants is a risk to the network, and I would like to see that group decentralized).

This smells of [premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization), where without the capability of obtaining empirical measurements (this is based on my assumption that we cannot reliably measure the effects of these changes) we are trying to optimize a system...which could lead to a lot of wasted time and unforeseen consequences.

That being said, right now is the best time to make changes to the tokenomics and voting structure, since the network is still so young and centralized. If any major unforeseen issues arise, with the help of the DFINITY Foundation and the Internet Computer Association, we could hopefully undo anything extremely harmful. As the network matures and decentralizes with time and usage, this ability to rapidly respond to harmful consequences will diminish.

All in all, this is risky. We do not know what will happen. We must ask ourselves if the tweaks are worth the possible catastrophes.

# Abstract

I want to argue against some of the claims made in the abstract of the article.

> The current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to i) attract sufficient new participants to offset the dissolving stakes of current participants, ii) encourage current participants to remain committed long term to the IC, iii) address conflict-of-interest risks that may prevent the IC from executing its mission long term.

## Point i

> The current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to: attract sufficient new participants to offset the dissolving stakes of current participants

### The ginormity of the genesis group

It is true that the NNS is having less ICP locked up than is dissolving. But I don't believe that is because of the tokenomics alone. We need to understand that the genesis group of stakers, according to my understanding, has made enormous gains on their original investments into ICP. If you look at the charts in the article, it is very clear that the genesis group overwhelms the post-genesis group in most metrics.

These people are going to want to get out of at least some of their positions (sell ICP). This makes sense. This is natural, and probably wise on their part. They have finished one of their major duties to the network, which was to fund it initially. This was incredibly risky on their part, and now they are reaping the rewards.

Let them get out! Let them sell! We really don't want an oligarchic group of original investors to control the Internet Computer, and so them selling could be one of the best things they can do for us. If they're selling, someone else is buying (assuming they aren't selling to themselves). If the price is low, then many more people can get exposure to ICP and start to materially participate in governance.

### The nascency of the Internet Computer

The Internet Computer is a very new network. It's been live for ~6 months, and has definitely not hit any kind of mainstream or even crypto adoption. This is fine, this is expected. Think about how difficult it is for people to land on an understanding, then trust, then commitment to the IC.

Assuming most users come to the Internet Computer through the traditional blockchain rabbit hole, then we need to realize that understanding Bitcoin is hard enough. Once Bitcoin is understood, then users must understand Ethereum and other general-purpose decentralized computers. After sifting through all of those, users must somehow come to a conviction that the Internet Computer is worth their commitment. How can we expect multitudes to arrive here when the network is so young, has no applications with major adoption, and has very few people talking about it?

It takes time to develop the core protocols, to ensure the security of the network, to make developer tools, and to make great apps. Just let it happen! Don't try to rush it so much, adoption will come as utility, decentralization, security, and scalability increase and are proven.

This is probably my main issue with the proposal and the article, the assumption that tweaking these parameters will drive more adoption to the IC. I simply believe it won't affect adoption materially, at least in the short-term.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-11-22 21:07:34 UTC | #83

## Point ii

> The current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to: encourage current participants to remain committed long term to the IC

This is true for the genesis group, but as I explained in a previous post, the genesis group has had such enormous gains that they are going to dissolve and sell a good chunk of ICP. This is expected, and I don't believe that increasing rewards will incentivize them to change their minds. 28.7% per year is already fantastic, unless you increase it to outrageous levels I don't see any significant portion of the genesis group moving to 8 year neurons.

Also, most neurons created post-genesis are going straight to 8 year locked neurons, which is exactly what we want them to do.

## Point iii

> The current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to: address conflict-of-interest risks that may prevent the IC from executing its mission long term

I believe the article explains this point as follows:

> This situation also creates a security concern, as there are many seed investors and early contributors who have evidenced a disinterest in remaining committed to the IC long term, in that they have chosen not to lock their neurons or increase their dissolve delays. Approximately 36.6% of voting power on the NNS is controlled by genesis accounts that are dissolving with less than 4 years remaining. Many of these entities could well have other blockchain investments or Big Tech investments that are directly threatened by the IC, and it is possible that they could execute governance actions with nefarious intent with little warning and a reasonably well-coordinated effort.

As explained in previous posts, I don't believe that tweaking the tokenomics parameters as proposed will cause a major shift in the genesis group. But even if that were the case, do we really want to try and keep these kinds of people around? Why not just let them leave?

If their neurons dissolve and they sell, we can get that ICP into the hands of more committed users who are much more likely to lock it up into 8 year neurons, as evidenced by the fact that most new neurons are 8 year locked neurons.

Just let them go! Let's decentralize this original group.

# Conclusion

I'm just not sure if the risks outweigh the rewards here. The default choice I lean towards is: do nothing.

In my opinion, there is not enough compelling evidence indicating a significant problem that needs to be addressed.

Let time pass, let the IC mature, let the apps develop, and let usage soar. That is the solution to our "problems", not tweaking parameters.

But then again, I don't necessarily have a problem with the parameter tweaks themselves (besides the risk of unknown consequences and a possibly bad precedent), just the underlying motivations for proposing them.

If you think the tweaks will result in a long-term better distribution of voting power and better reward for time commitment, and you're okay with the risks...there's no better time than now (except for the past) to do this. It's only going to get harder to change as the network matures.

[quote="ajismyid, post:3, topic:8661"]
Regarding the proposal that mention the current NNS tokenomics parameters have failed to i) attract sufficient new participants to offset the dissolving stakes of current participants, ii) encourage current participants to remain committed long term to the IC, I do not see the problem is on the delay & age bonus multiplier (looks fair to me), but I do see the problem is on the requirement of minimum ICP can be spawned. (1 ICP right now).
[/quote]

The minimum of 1 ICP per neuron has been introduced since the space in the governance canister is limited – currently it can hold up to 200'000 neurons. The minimum of 1 ICP ensures that it's at least _very_ expensive to allocate all those neurons and thereby prevent other people from participating in governance.

There are two possibilities for addressing the problem that you describe:
- First, improve scalability of the governance system. That is certainly something that needs to be done, but it will certainly take a bit of time.
- Allow disbursing liquid ICP instead of it being locked into neurons – for small rewards.

I think the latter one definitely makes sense; the reasons for distributing neurons instead of liquid ICP seem more important for large stakers. If this is an important point for the community, we should bring it on the roadmap. I don't think it's hard to implement.

EDIT: The main reason for distributing neurons is preventing bank-run scenarios, where during a quick drop if token price panic makes people sell – increasing price pressure. That problem is smaller for rewards of less than 1 ICP.

I think this proposal could improve **retention**, but not necessarily help **adoption**. What we need is very little incentive for holding liquid ICP, which means more rewards for shorter staking periods -- although maybe also shifting voting power toward the longer spectrum as this proposal would do. That way, people who just want to get their feet wet for the sake of rewards would be incentivized to stake more-and-earlier, while those who later want to help guide the development the IC would be incentivized to begin increase their lockup duration.

> If you look at the charts in the article, it is very clear that the genesis group overwhelms the post-genesis group in most metrics.

> If their neurons dissolve and they sell, we can get that ICP into the hands of more committed users who are much more likely to lock it up into 8 year neurons, as evidenced by the fact that most new neurons are 8 year locked neurons.

Where can I find this data? I couldn't find it in OP's post.

> If the price is low, then many more people can get exposure to ICP and start to materially participate in governance.

I'm not sure this is true. Ironically, in investing if the price is high more people will want to buy it.

-----

Now that I think about it, I feel like for an early-stage, ambitious project like the IC, highly committed advocates (i.e. 8 year stakers) are actually way more valuable than casual supporters (i.e. <1-2 year stakers).

Highly committed advocates do your marketing, they build your dapps, they grow your ecosystem, they make proposals like this and discuss them on forums like this. We need more highly committed advocates if this project is to realize the potential we all think it has.

Casual supporters are mostly bystanders who treat ICP as another slice in their portfolio with a "wait and see" approach. There's more of them so it may seem like having them "decentralizes" the voter base, but in reality these people just follow DFINITY and nothing else (i.e. that's not decentralized). Only highly committed advocates take the time to read and think about proposals like this.

If we agree that we want more highly committed advocates at this stage in the IC's development, then the question is: will bigger long-term rewards lead to more highly committed advocates?

> If we agree that we want more highly committed advocates at this stage in the IC’s development, then the question is: will bigger long-term rewards lead to more highly committed advocates?

I think it could, but executing this proposal isn't nearly enough. We would need to blast this on Twitter, write Medium articles, etc in order to promote this new APY. If we just vote "yes" and move on with our lives, nothing will come out of this besides existing 8-year stakers getting paid more and existing 1-2 year stakers getting paid less. That would probably have a negative effect IMO.

So unless there's a clear marketing plan on how we're going to promote this, I'm leaning no.

My largest concern is the centralising of tokenholdership through governance participation. PoW networks had operational costs that forced recipients of new tokes to sell. This distributed ownership. The IC includes no such pressure. The SNS and the community fund may help with this but we don't know how much yet.

Secondly, I disagree with the entire premise that we should "incentivise" governance participation. It should be rewarded yes, but participation should be a decision made deliberately, not by default or polluted by financial motivation other than the future success of the protocol. This selects the wrong people. Locking in the seed holders appears to have been a very last minute decision and in my opinion, ill-considered. We just locked in a whole bunch of apathetic voters. This undermines the entire NNS.

Why would we not want to see the dissenting seed neurons dissolve and their ICP distributed. They never chose to be on this team. However, @wpb, one of the creators of this report purchased tokens from the market after launch. Would it not be preferential for people like Wenzel to enjoy higher sell pressure & lower prices in the short term?

The low price may not be ideal but these are juicy lemons that we can make all kinds of lemonade from.

I will follow up with a blog post for cycle_dao. I think this discussion should be revisited in 6 months. The SNS will be out
The environment will have changed.

Kyle, Alex, and I have met several times over the past few days to discuss the appropriate path forward on this proposal.  We recognize that the number of views on this forum topic have been increasing significantly and that there have been many intellectually honest comments posted here on the forum toward the end of our deliberation period.  As originally planned (the wait for quiet provision), we believe the appropriate course of action is to extend the deliberation until Monday, November 29.  That will give everyone additional time to consider the new opinions and ideas that continue to be presented.  This deliberation has definitely been a healthy discussion on this important topic and we really appreciate everyone's participation.  We are listening and your comments are shaping our thoughts on the appropriate path forward.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-11-25 14:10:50 UTC | #93

This a bit rough given that discussion is still ongoing, but the blog post is here:

https://twitter.com/cycle_dao/status/1463868413068128261?s=20

Given that motion proposals are live for a matter of hours we feel it is important to provide an opinion in advance of the vote. If our perspective changes, we will strongly publicise the fact. 

I think @lastmjs summed up the strongest argument against accepting this proposal well with his comment on premature optimisation. That said, this process has been extremely valuable and whether or not the proposal succeeds, hopefully, this has sown the seeds of ongoing discussion.

Hey Arthur, thanks for taking the time to write your blog post.  It was very enlightening to read about the collective opinion from cycle_dao on this topic.  It is an important and strong voice in the IC community.

We have been interested in learning about actionable recommendations from the community on our proposal to make sure it is properly considered.  In the conclusions section of your article, you made the suggestion that “The Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters should be shelved for 6 months during which time ICP tokens have time to circulate in the market and unlocking/onboarding trends have a greater chance to emerge.”  This is an actionable suggestion and we agree that it would be an appropriate next step to put this question before the governing body of the IC.  We believe this is a question that should be decided by the governing body because at this time we have no idea who is a vocal minority on this topic and we believe the appropriate way to make decisions on this topic is through the NNS.

You are welcome to submit this motion proposal to the NNS yourself, but I would also be willing to do it on your behalf.  The motion needs a title and a summary.  I have made an attempt at writing this out based on the information you provided in your article.  However, this is your motion and the wording needs to reflect your thoughts.  Feel free to edit as needed or you can come up with a totally different motion.

If this motion is made, then I would recommend the following timeline: 
1) as soon as possible you should post in this forum topic the exact wording you want included in the motion so folks have time to review, deliberate, and decide how they would vote
2) on Mon, Nov 29 either you or I will submit the NNS Motion to Postpone.

Please advise how you would like to proceed.

Edit: Removed content from this post that Arthur reposted with edits below.

I love the collaborative spirit Wenzel! I think there is an opportunity to conduct some fantastic research here.

[quote="wpb, post:94, topic:8661"]
Title: Motion to Postpone for 6 Months the Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters

Summary (including all 4 paragraphs below):
Arthur Falls, representing the cycle_dao organization, makes this motion to postpone for 6 months the Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters that is currently in deliberation at [Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters/8661)

The rationale for the proposal is good, but at this time the cycle_dao believes more data should be collected before changing the core economics of the NNS. Postponing this proposal will provide an opportunity for broader community consultation and more data for modelling. After this 6 month period, a proposal could be submitted based on the conditions at the time. 
One subject to interrogate during this time is the cost/benefit of locking up large volumes of ICP over a range of time frames.
A second subject is how, or possibly whether to proactively engage neuron holders in the governance process.
For further information, please read our blog post at [NNS Proposal: Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters](https://cycledao.xyz/posts/nns-proposal-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters)

Accept: To vote Yes (Accept) means you agree that the Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters should be postponed for 6 months.

Reject: To vote No (Reject) means you do not agree that the Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters should be postponed for 6 months.

Motion to Postpone for 6 Months the Proposal is that most people are 6-month stakers ? Are you waiting for them to disband?

I use Google Translate and the grammar is not smooth, please forgive me

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-11-27 13:10:59 UTC | #98

@chishan1082  The motion to postpone for 6 months is made by cycle_dao because they believe more time is needed before our proposal to change the dissolve delay bonus and age bonus parameters is voted by the governing body.  Their position is that more data needs to be collected, more community discussion needs to occur, and there are some research questions that can be answered by waiting 6 months.

The Motion to Postpone is not intended to cause anyone to change their staking strategy.  

If you take a look at the original medium article that we published, you will find tables that show number of neurons, ICP in neurons, voting power of neurons, and voting reward yield for neurons organized by dissolve delay and neuron state of dissolving and not dissolving.  It shows that most neurons still have 0 - 4 year dissolve delays due to the initial allocations and that most new neurons are 8 year dissolve delay and not dissolving.  This data shows that most people are not 6 month stakers.

Cycle_dao has asked me to submit the Motion to Postpone for 6 Months the Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters.  I will do that on Mon, Nov 29 at approx 12:00pm-1:00pm UTC using the wording Arthur provided. I will post on the forum, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram (Dfinity Community and ICP Maximalist Network), DSCVR, and Distrikt immediately after the proposal is submitted asking people to vote.  Arthur will promote through his channels as well.  It would be good if everyone can help spread the word.

There are both Pros and Cons for postponing the proposal.  A few are listed here.  Others are welcome to comment their own opinions.

Pros
* It will allow more time to discuss the proposal as a community.  It is very important that this proposal is well understood and properly debated.
* It will allow more time to observe how current developments on the IC attract new users and developers to the IC and whether they are inclined to participate in governance (e.g. BTC and ETH integration, DeFi, SNS, SoFi, NFTs, Achievement Unblocked program, Community Grants program, people parties).  These are all big developments that are expected to happen over the next 6 months and they will attract new people.

Cons
* Approx 33M ICP will be unlocked due to currently dissolving neurons and we will have given those neuron owners no reason to consider changing their staking strategy
* It is likely that there will be significantly more ICP removed from the NNS than what is newly added through staking new neurons.  This means neuron owners that are disadvantaged by tokenomic changes will have less voting power to Reject a proposal in 6 months compared to what they have today.

I think it is very important for the governing body to decide if our proposal should be postponed or not.  Therefore, I fully support this motion to postpone.  In fact, I will be submitting the motion on behalf of cycle_dao at Authur’s request.  That said, my personal opinion is that we should not wait 6 months.  I think we can achieve acceptable deliberation much sooner and that data exists today that supports the need for an actionable proposal to change key tokenomic parameters.  I will be voting to reject the motion to postpone, but will be fully supportive of the final result no matter which way it goes.

Sometimes paying too much attention to details can do more harm than good! We all can have chicken and egg arguments (which one came first) as long as we are all aware it will not help anyone. However, it is indisputable that eight years of locked neuron holders can only have one motivation, IC, to succeed in the long run! That in itself is enough reason not to delay the proposal and go ahead.

Hello Wenzel et al.,

I have tried prompting many ICP-holding friends to move their coins into the NNS. Most have voiced preference for keeping ICP on the exchanges (primarily binance) while they wait for staking to become available on Binance.

Unfortunately, many people feel most comfortable with storing their coins on exchanges because that’s all they know. It’s their safety blanket.

To increase the amount of ICP staked, I **strongly recommend** looking into allowing people to stake through the exchanges. 

One of the most successful long-term lockups is the staking of Ethereum on the Beacon chain. A lot of people can easily participate in this via Binance.

Most of the crypto consumer base have yet to discover Defi. They’re still being spoon fed services through exchanges. We must adapt to yield full benefit.


Hope you take my recommendation into consideration.

Thank you kindly for reading,
Pwo 🙏🏽
