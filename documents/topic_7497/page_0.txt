Hi, I top up each day my neuron. Until today, it was increasing continuously. Yersteday, my age bonus was 1,029. Today, it is 1,015 ! Any help of the supportâ€™please ?

@hpeebles  I asked to you on another conversation, but maybe it is better to restart another one, for better clarity for anyone. I am so disappointed. I wanted to keep all my bag locked forever, but with that fall, I am a little worried.
