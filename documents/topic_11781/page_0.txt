Hello everyone,

We at the DFINITY Foundation have been working to provide greater visibility into our roadmap and more opportunities for the community to provide feedback on DFINITYâ€™s contributions to the Internet Computer through forum threads, AMAs, community conversations, and 1:1 working sessions with developer teams. The next evolution of this work and something we have been very excited to get off the ground for some time now is the idea of **technical working groups**. Over the past few weeks, we have been discussing potential structures and topics for these groups both internally and with several members of the community. We would like to share the proposed path forward here.

Some guidelines on how we are thinking about these working groups:

* The goal of these working groups is to define **shared objectives and priorities** between the Foundation and the IC community. Each working group will identify initiatives that translate into a shared roadmap, where the Foundation can actively collaborate with community members on shared roadmap items.
* Working groups should focus on frameworks, standards, infrastructure, and public goods and not the commercial interests of anyone dapp, platform, or specific vertical (as many of the proposed technical topics cut across many verticals).
* Each working group will have a DFINITY lead, a community lead, and a coordinator.
* Forum threads will be created for each working group, similar to how DFINITY's roadmap items are discussed today.
* Meetings will be hosted on Zoom, and all meeting notes will be made publicly available afterward in the respective forum threads.
* Proposed cadence will be monthly.
* Coordinating across all time zones will be tricky, so we will try out the below proposed time slots for now and adjust as needed.

Thanks for setting this up, having a developer events calendar we can subscribe to is sweet!!!

I see there isn't an infrastructure topic - is this covered under developer tooling/scalability (i.e. potential overlap)?

Also, some of these are pretty straight forward (i.e. canister metrics & reporting, network governance, etc.), but others have some more overlap (i.e. identity & auth, security & audits, privacy), so it would be great if each of these topics could include a brief 1 sentence/paragraph scope of what types of questions/topics are appropriate for each meeting.

-------------------------

alexa.smith | 2022-03-30 00:17:13 UTC | #3

Yes, we imagine there will be some overlap here and there, but it will really be up to the working groups to define scope, agenda, etc. once up-and-running. There will also likely be a separate monthly meeting just for leads where some of these overlapping topics (or gaps) can be identified.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-03-31 01:00:59 UTC | #4

Oh no, the dreaded 5pm CET... :face_with_spiral_eyes:

Really exciting stuff. +1 to a future Scalability working group.

BTW, the @dfx-json handle is really clever.

**Topic: Ledger & Tokenization**
I am one of the initiators of CBD (Canister Builder DAO) and standardization is the main matter of CBD.
First of all, Fungible Token and Non-fungible Token are very different things and each deserves to be discussed separately, so I suggest that the official Working Group should create different Topics to discuss them separately.

Hi Witter, I'm leading the Ledger & Tokenization working group. I agree with you that we should discuss Fungible and Non-Fungible Token Standards separately. During the working group today I explained that we will do so and we will start with Fungible Tokens.

mariop | 2022-04-12 17:56:15 UTC | #12

Hi everyone, I'm happy to announce that we have decided to reduce the time between Ledger & Tokenization working group meeting from 1 month to 2 weeks to speed up the discussion around token standards. The next meeting will be the 26th of April. More info in the [separate forum thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-token-standard-as-topic-of-the-first-meeting-of-the-ledger-tokenization-working-group/11925/6).

ayjayem | 2022-04-25 02:46:15 UTC | #13

In addition to the working groups already rolling out, I would like to propose prioritizing the planned working group for Network Governance. I believe a dedicated forum could help focus and synthesize discussions taking place around spam proposals and related matters.

I bought $OT token on icdex platform today. However, I had a problem. I made a few attempts to perform the purchase process. but there was no change in my wallet balance. So the purchase was not happening. I guess I thought the platform is not active and I left the platform. A few hours later, when I entered my wallet, I saw that the transaction was completed. I hope the developers will fix this problem.

@osman as one of the moderators, I donâ€™t think this is the right place to put your comment since itâ€™s not quite relevant. Can you make a new forum post or maybe reach out to the platform you used?

I became aware of idex with dom.icp âˆž link sharing and started using it. In fact, I wrote it here because it is a the ICP platform project exists. Maybe project owners can read and develop their projects. Thanks for the warning, too.

The delay might be due to various factors like prioritization, resource allocation, or development complexities. Once the detailed roadmap is available, it will provide insights into the team's activities, facilitating community feedback and alignment.
