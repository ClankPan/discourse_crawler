This is very interesting IMO :slight_smile: 
I look forward to participating in the SNS sale!

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2023-09-08 20:13:59 UTC | #4

I am confident that Sonic is at the point where he can use the SNS to go and build more.
I only want to take a look at the audit that Code&State did.

-------------------------

We need professionals to audit the project.

memecake | 2023-09-09 02:29:12 UTC | #6

Comparing Binance Swap with a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool is like comparing apples to oranges; it's not only inappropriate but also indicates a misunderstanding of how LBPs function. For a better grasp, you're welcome to consult the LBP documentation in our repository or refer to materials provided by Balancer. 

Thank you.

Scammers

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-09-09 14:54:02 UTC | #8

Excited for this one. Awaiting for the audit report. I have confidence in the team.

-------------------------

aiv | 2023-09-09 15:21:50 UTC | #9

A scam would be a team that runs away with money, using an app that isn't real. The Sonic team members are Doxed, have been known for building within the ecosystem for years now, and they are clearly building real dapps, which would be a very dumb way to run a scam. If they were dishonest there are a lot of easier ways they could have run away with user funds by now, that's clearly not their intent.

This just looks like extreme slippage, which is normal on any LBP on any platform on L1. Could they have communicated the slippage warnings about this better? Maybe. Are there possible UI improvements and other things they should add? Probably. For example, they should probably add something that reverts the transaction in the case of slippage that goes over a max threshold. I'm sure that's on the roadmap, but they do position this as an early stage product.

You are using an alpha product on an experimental network within an emerging industry. Never spend what you cannot afford to lose and give the builders a little grace, we are all human and they are just trying their best. We all love the IC, name calling helps no one. Stay safe out there!

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-09-09 16:36:29 UTC | #10

Education is important and unfortunately many ICP members expect to reap 1000X from every swap. LBP is a different beast and many jump without due diligence. 

The screenshot above shows Sonic disclaimer but CT thought it’s the documentation!!! Imagine the level of understanding.

The audit is done. Auditing and rectification goes hand in hand. It’s not done keeping projects blindsided. That’s not the point. 

Audit reports generally takes 2-3 business days to generate. It’s a 25+ page tech report.

If you were, there will be a difference in a UI from previous events to prevent this to happen. That did not happen before and, we both know that you wont change anything, right ? You had time the last 3-6 months.

But yeah save the face and pretend you care ;)

We encourage everyone to focus on SNS-related topics in this channel to maintain the discussion's relevance.

-------------------------

aiv | 2023-09-09 21:05:29 UTC | #19

The audit is done, we're just cleaning up the report.

The audit was over the Swap canister (which is part of the SNS launch), not the LBP canister (which is a separate dapp and not part of the SNS launch).

To summarize, Swap canister was solid. There were some findings from the audit (which the Sonic team is resolving as we speak) because it was so thorough, but at the end of the day the auditors would feel safe having their own money in the swap canister as it is currently coded. That in itself says enough!

Full audit is actually 39 pages long right now. Total audit duration was 4.5 weeks by a team of 3 auditors
 Completion date was just two days ago on 9/7, so that's why we're still just polishing up the grammar, etc of the report. I'm excited to see the full audit report published!

Just takes a bit of time!

@anon98653474 @memecake and others…

I am going to make this simple:

1. If anyone has a concern about X, it is reasonable to say “I am concerned about X”… but if you keep repeating it, I will take it as “spam”. Once you made your point, if you do not like something, move on. Let people decide.

2. It is reasonable to say “I do not think X is safe because of Y” or “I am worried about the trade offfs of Z” or “not helpful to X” but i will not tolerate calling things or projects “scams” because that projects an intent on the makers that is usually just the readers preference. 

3. If many people flag a comment, we will review it. We do not remove for being unpopular, but we will remove for being off topic or mean.

So in short:

1. If you have concern, post and post respectfully.
2. If anyone keeps posting same concern, we will take it as FUD and spam (we really cannot be mediating all the time what is and is not valid concern so we will allot one freebie).
3. If anyone posts concerns in an ad hominem way, we will remove.
4. People should take care of how to post concerns or questions.
5. If a project is not for someone, that is valid. Just move on.

Sorry but if I raise a concern and people just object by "he is not understanding LBP" while LBP is **designed** to absolutely not protect users ( who gets a 10 times higher rate on a swap saying it would swap ), I believe this is something that should be repeated and not just silenced and flooded afterwards by messages.

Sonic is now just a gun pointed at people just waiting for someone to detect when a swap activity will happen to add huge money, change the rate, and sell it directly afterwards. Absolute no users protection and those issues happens only when it worth it for the robot behind it, so thats a minority of times, letting people disgusted.

have you even tried their LPB ? Or you just trust the people with the majority of messages here ? ( quality and quantity.. or biased people ? ) If i was a scammer I would LOVE that sonic stays as it is to use it as a weapon against people.

So yeah. gun is not killing "alone", so sonic is not a scam without a bad intended user. So in the end we should blame the canister ? The bad actor making the canister ? Or should be better answer the issues of the original design flaw that **they keep in purpose** in the platform design ?

If you like that such a product to adds a extra unsafe layer on ICs ( that is marketed to be safe ) keep censoring me without giving me alternatives, we will just lose more new users ( and absolutely lose the fact that we are supposed to be safe )

I disagree. 

If you say X and people reply that you don’t understand X, that’s on them. If they ask follow up questions, one should feel free to answer.

But to repeat the same points “until people get it” is not working. 

If you are afraid of your message being lost in the shuffle of messages, I’m sorry but that’s the nature of online forums.

If you are afraid people do not listen enough to you, I’m not sure what to tell you. That’s also a consequence of communication and engagement style.

This goes the other way too, if someone keeps spamming you with the same points “until you get it”, I will see their behavior as spam.

-------------------------

edge | 2023-09-11 11:41:21 UTC | #41

When Sonic first proposed social networking, there was no precedent other than Open chat, and the proposal was rejected due to numerous concerns. Yes, "to protect the Neuron Fund."

Since then many SNSs have been submitted and many have been passed, but how do you think those projects that were passed compare to Sonic in terms of credibility?


My personal opinion
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-boom-dao-sns-decentralization-sale/21577/239?u=edge

My understanding is that Sonic is going to start a new one, SNS-W, which will do for ICP what Synthetix is doing with SNX as collateral to create a variety of synthetic assets. Tokens that could not be handled before, such as stablecoin, can be achieved in the Sonic economy. Depending on how it is done, it may be possible to increase the utility of ckbtc, SNS-1, etc.

Since it is important for these products to increase their pledge, access to SNS funds is more reasonable than before. Also, based on recent examples, products dealing with finance will not only need a one-time Audit, but the cost of regular audits and bounties will also be important.

Since Meme cake they have been working on increasing liquidity and I hope SNS will be something that will allow them to realize their plans.

**You are lying.** You like scamming people or you just pretend you dont understand ?

**I am asking that when you click swap, what you swap ( the amount and rate ) for is confirmed before it occures. Amount SHOULD BE locked for 5 sec and not open to changes. So that if a whale buy before you ( or a automated swap to manipulate price ) you are still swaping the amount you asked for**

SPOILER : this is world standards !! Just like any standard swap in the world ( just check Binance, they is a confirmation button before you do it )

If you promote the unsafe way its simply because YOU benefit for it and SCAM PEOPLE.

It's very difficult to use. The dapp does not display the balance in the wallet on the link. I don't know how you use it. I'm very uncomfortable to use it. Often the balance is gone and I can't trade. It's still the same today.

Hi Sonic team, 
I noticed the following in the provided [init file](https://github.com/sonicdex/sonic-v1/blob/main/sns/config/sns.yml): 
* Numerous dev neurons possess a vesting period of 0. 
* This implies that the dev team could extend the dissolve delay to its maximum (1 year) at genesis. Such an action would amplify their voting power, potentially pushing them over the 50% threshold. 
* I believe it is crucial to provide an assessment of the feasibility of acquiring a majority. The voting power of the dev team at genesis is 45.5% and thus it would not take much to get over 50%.

-------------------------

Bugslayer | 2023-09-22 18:53:05 UTC | #60

Hi @bjoernek ,
Thanks for the feedback. Those are our community seed investors.  comprising approximately 47 investors will receive 2% of our token supply. These tokens will be distributed in five equal-value neurons. The first neuron has no dissolve delay, while the remaining four have dissolve delays of 3 months, with vesting periods of 0, 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively.

The founding team will have a voting power of 32.1% at Genesis If you are asking about the voting power shown in the token analyzer, it's the combined value of team, fleek allocation, and community investors, please see our token paper for more details.

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-09-22 23:43:04 UTC | #62

Thank you for the comment. The valuation for sale is just 7.5M. If we achieve full funding, then the valuation will be around 15.7M. 

Besides this, we have already established a market cap via LBP where hundreds of community members have participated. We have also conducted community private sales.

I voted yes with my named neuron but I’m disappointed that the starting valuation was kept the same. If it fails again I’ll vote no next time if market cap isn’t brought down.

-------------------------

memecake | 2023-09-26 11:07:48 UTC | #66

Thank you for your vote.

As previously discussed, our post-money valuation, based on the minimum capital requirement, stands at 2.38 million ICP, which is approximately equivalent to 7.14 million USD at the current market rate. The pre-money valuation, under these conditions, would be 1.88 million ICP, which translates to roughly 5.6 million USD.

Given that this is an open sale with a consistent liquidity option, there's no need to factor in the maximum capital cap when calculating valuations since investors have the choice to invest more as they see fit.


You can do a market research and compare other DEXs who have raised fund at this stage and then take a look at Sonic.


Thank you
