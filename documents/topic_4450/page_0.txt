[This tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1397741085280116736?s=20) by Dan Abramov from the React team got me thinking: what can we do to improve composability on the Internet Computer?

Currently, Candid binds calls together, so that agents in different languages can communicate easily with type safety, which is a great start. I think we can do more though. How do you think we could improve composability on the IC so that the community can reach to off-the-shelf solutions for virtually any sort of computational challenge?

* A package/canister registry with type-directed search
* dfx can notify users before installing canisters if matching modules exist already
