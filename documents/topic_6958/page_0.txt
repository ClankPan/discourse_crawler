The Fungible Token Standard is an important infrastructure of Dfinity.

DeLand Labs has proposed a fungible token standard (DL Standard), please check here:

The improvement of the standard requires the participation of the community.

Weâ€™ve organized an AMA event on Reddit to collect the questions and feedback of the DL standard.

Please feel free to leave your questions, comments and advices. Upvote the questions you like to learn the answers. Help us to continuously improve the standard.

We will reply the questions on September 6.
