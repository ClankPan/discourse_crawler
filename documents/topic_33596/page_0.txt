Hey, I'm here to inform you about a critical rounding error in the SNS UI that urgently needs to be fixed. This error resulted in fewer than 100 $MOTOKO being staked for a significant period, which is unsustainable for a functioning DAO. Fortunately, we avoided a potential takeover during this time, where someone could have purchased the DAO and altered the tokenomics. 

Hopefully, this issue will be addressed soon.

Hey @Phasma, thank you for reaching out! Could you be describe **in as much detail as possible** what exactly the issue is?

1. Where is the rounding error? What numbers are affected (try to list all)
2. How did the rounding error result in less MOTOKO being staked?

Screenshots, logs and anything else that shows what the problem is would be very welcome!

Hey @chepreghy , here's a summary of an issue the Motoko community discovered with the SNS a while back.

Due to a rounding error, some neurons werenâ€™t assigned voting rights. This bug manifests by keeping the maximum resolution delay at 6 days and 23 hours for some users, effectively leaving them without voting rights. Consequently, no Motokos were staked during this period.

This needs to be addressed promptly to ensure full participation from everyone in the community.

I managed to reproduce it, we are investigating the issue. Thank you for reporting!

This probably was the $MOTOKO community, not the Motoko community, which are unrelated afaict.

Thanks for rising this issue. We really need to fix it!

Just to clarify: you can still adjust the dissolve delay in the NNS dapp to make your neurons eligible. Even if you initially didn't set a high enough dissolve dealy.

Having to adjust the dissolve delay multiple times isn't the best approach; it's more of a workaround than a true solution.

I know, we will propose a fix, but users who already have neurons will need to change update dissolve delay.

Hi Andrew, this doesn't work for some neurons. We tested it with multiple neurons, and only a few of them worked

-------------------------

Have you tried all of these 3 things?
* Click "Max" and update
* Click "Min" and update
* Type in 7 manually and update

-------------------------

Failed in "Max" because of no additional delay to be increased, but "Min" worked for one of my neurons, again, not all of them lol
