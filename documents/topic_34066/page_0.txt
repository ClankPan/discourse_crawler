**Proof of work as a voting neuron:**

As a member of the **B3Pay team**, in this post, I‚Äôll indicate the steps I‚Äôve taken to verify an NNS Canister Upgrade Proposal, specifically focusing on ensuring that the Wasm code aligns with the specified source code repository. Below is the detailed process I followed to verify the Wasm hash, upgrade argument, and the governance canister ID for the proposal to upgrade the Ledger Canister.

I located the specific NNS Canister Upgrade Proposal I intended to verify 131701. 
I cloned the ic repository, which includes the proposed changes for the canister upgrade. After cloning, I fetched the latest changes to ensure I had the most up-to-date code.

To ensure I was examining the exact version of the code linked to the proposal, and checked out the specified commit using the following command:

```bash

git checkout 2bdfdc54ccc7ef27dd7b4f37aaea172198dce6ab

```

After checking out the correct commit, I built the Wasm file to verify its hash. Then I compared this hash with the one provided in the proposal, confirming that the proposal‚Äôs claim was accurate and that the Wasm code was as expected.

**As a Member of the B3Pay Team, Here's How I Approved Proposal #131701 Similar @Ali did :**

Proposal Summary:

* **Proposal to Upgrade the Ledger Canister**
* **Proposer:** DFINITY Foundation
* **Git Hash:** 2bdfdc54ccc7ef27dd7b4f37aaea172198dce6ab
* **New Wasm Hash:** 5714a608b4c0af565c5c348e7c54e837512bc47e8f271add6bcd680ec72ef9a0
* **Upgrade Args Hash:** 10bc8d3f78b366304e4a41383fa486584474f82ab1641b23078d5cb9a0806819
* **Target Canister:** ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai

To begin, I will perform the initial verification steps similar to what @Ali did:

**Check Git Hash, New Wasm Hash, and Args Hash** (as demonstrated in the attached screenshots).
![Untitled design (1)|690x362](upload://8d1pO5rpvZF6SYgoWhU0q6fJWJq.jpeg)


After that :

**Analyze and Check Changes:** I will thoroughly analyze and check the changes, noting any modifications in the code (as illustrated in the provided example).
![Approve|690x369](upload://lT9QvlEOy8inA5HBTywD5mNAAuV.png)



**Document the Analysis Process:** I will continue the analysis process until completion, ensuring detailed documentation of all changes.

**Review and Confirmation:** I will review the changes and confirm their accuracy against the proposal details.

Finally, I will forward my observations and conclusions to @b3hr4d, our Team Leader, for a final review and decision.

Next, for the argument verification, I used `didc` command to create the verification file from arguments, it was confirmed that the proposed args hash is the same as the generated hash we obtained.

![Upgrade Args Hash|690x435](upload://3PBRROsLLec608fPTW7ZbgsasKH.png)

Finally, I verified the governance canister ID to ensure that the proposal was targeting the correct canister.

Hi Behrad,

Just to let you know that the proposal that was submitted was under "motion" type, but it should have been by "Register Known Neuron".

![1000027784|230x500](upload://gkgjgD83USEzcgexOAcxeuVTylA.jpeg)


Can you submit a new one?

Thanks :pray:

Hi @tiago89,

Thanks for catching that! üôè I appreciate your help. I‚Äôll submit a new proposal with the correct type, ‚ÄúRegister Known Neuron‚Äù soon. I‚Äôll keep everyone updated once it's live.
