I wanted to introduce you to the development of our game, Pixelpunk, a pixel art multiplayer RPG that brings the intriguing cyberpunk universe to your web browser! Dive into an exciting journey of completing missions, developing your character, challenging other players in battle arenas, and even earning money by collecting unique NFTs.

Pixelpunk sets itself apart from traditional MMO games by placing a strong emphasis on single-player gameplay. The game revolves around a captivating story, presenting players with challenging quests and thrilling combat scenarios. Despite its focus on individual adventures, the game also features special multiplayer zones where you can connect with other players to trade, compete in battle arenas, or engage in casual conversation.
