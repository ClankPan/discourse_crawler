I'm trying to build a general canister that people can use to embed their frontend into the canister binary instead of using the asset canister. 

https://github.com/ocluf/embedded-frontend-canister

I'm trying to copy the same mechanism as in the nns dapp  https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/blob/main/dfx.json with a custom build script that creates a .tar of the frontend assets. However when I try to use the "custom" canister type I get the following error:

`thread 'main' panicked at 'Could not run custom tool.: Os { code: 13, kind: PermissionDenied, message: "Permission denied" }', src/dfx/src/lib/builders/custom.rs:207:31`

When I look at the source code of the SDK the line numbers don't go that far. Does anybody know where that error could come from?

I think youâ€™d need to try looking at the tag of an older version, e.g.

https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/066c0f9951ed1f03b747d52f323fd6338b814e55/src/dfx/src/lib/builders/custom.rs#L207

For anyone seeing this in the future I had to make the build,sh script executable with:

chmod +x build.sh
