Sometimes I have the need to convert from one token to another.

ICP is not that easy to convert, so I was wondering what exchanges, centralized or decentralized you use particularly to convert to USDT, USDC or BTC? Which are quite popular but not part of the IC ecosystem?

Those that work for me are:
- Coinbase
- Uniswap

Any others you can recommend?

some wallets support to swap cross network, e.g Atomic
