Dear DFinity Community,

I happened upon DFinity a few days ago.  At this moment I can't remember exactly how, but I think that it may have been a fortunate 'accident.'  A couple of days ago I was not able to post and sent a message that found its way to Support.  I am certain that was not the proper route for this message.

I might be getting ahead of myself and I might not know enough about DFinity's effort and the Motoko language to make recommendations, but here is one.  Some of the development efforts that I have read about here seem to be heading in the area of 'breakout' application or at least to create alternatives to existing services.  I think (again, early, unexpert, newbie thinking) that DFinity and Motoko could provide a platform for Smart City application development.  The message that went to Support contained this suggestion.

I wonder what the experienced developers here think of this idea?  I would be very interested to hear some responses.
