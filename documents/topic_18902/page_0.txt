Hi my frontend is vanilla html (without react or bootstrap or anything)
How can I enable hotreloading to quickly modify my frontend?

Thank you

I would go for [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev) that supports various flavor including vanilla. That way you can have hot reload, keep it bare minimal while adding everything you need to have a nice fast JS toolchain (dev, build, test, lint, etc.).

Alternatively, never tried, found this npm little [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) package that supports hot reload.

This is pretty handy if you use VSCode as it requires no setup.
