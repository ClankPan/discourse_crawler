Should the IC be investing in AI?

The latest "tech release" hype cycle showed us that consumer tech is obsessed with AI coprocessors. 

Given the choice of running a model locally or on the IC I would always choice to run my model locally. I gain nothing on running my model on the IC provided I trust my device. 

With that, I think we can argue that users only stand to gain using decentralized models if they behave with a high level of compliance for a specific task. Something which as far as I know we haven't seen.

Penny for your thoughts?

While running models locally has its advantages, such as privacy and control, the IC offers a range of benefits that should be considered when deciding where to run AI models. The IC's scalability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration, security, reliability, access to specialized hardware, and compliance with regulations make it a compelling option for many AI use cases

Yes, but definitely not as a main focus, as efforts in other areas would be more productive.
