# 1. Summary
Corporations, individuals, and their legal teams today send DMCA notices when their copyrights are infringed upon, but these notices have no jurisdiction on an end-to-end decentralized computing platform owned and operated by those who have staked ICP in neurons.

At minimum, we need a process for submitting NNS proposals to take canisters down in such future situations when a node provider receives a DMCA notice. 

# 2. Background
Nintendo sent one node provider a DMCA notice to take down the canister running Super Mario 64 on Monday Dec 6, 2021. This node provider then contacted the Dfinity foundation for help, and Dfinity decided to submit an NNS proposal to take the canister down. Here's the [forum thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-proposal-and-discussion-on-content-moderation/9424/119).

Over the next 24 hours, the community held a variety of conversations in this forum, on Twitter, and elsewhere to discuss the situation. What we found was that the breadth of new topics uncovered apply only to permission-less, decentralized computing platforms that serve web, which at the moment are problems only the Internet Computer is powerful enough to require solutions for.

# 3. Proposal
Given that an NNS proposal is the only way to take a canister down, the main question we should discuss is: Who will be submitting the proposal next time someone on the IC gets a DMCA notice?

I propose we encourage the entity desiring to take the canister down to do so through an NNS proposal from their own neuron for no other reasons than 1) it makes the most logical sense and 2) this being a perfect opportunity to facilitate adoption. 

The vision for the Internet Computer is one where the internet is governed on-chain and open to everyone's participation, corporate interests included. Onboarding a Nintendo neuron would have been a massive signal that not only is this possible today, but it's a beautiful vision for how we want to govern internet applications more broadly.

# 4. An MVP proposal
- Draft instructions for how exactly a corporation should submit their DMCA to the Internet Computer (create neuron & submit proposal, including evidence of the legitimacy of this notice)
- Create a form capture for submitting DMCA notices to the IC in a publicly accessible/visible section of Dfinity's website (could be hosted on the IC but at least prominently available from Dfinity to signal "official" support)
- Integrate this form capture more deeply with the NNS over time to make it an onboarding funnel for neuron creation

Let's discuss

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2021-12-08 21:28:46 UTC | #2

Quick thought…are canisters linked to neurons?  I think they are and if so, can the neuron which is supporting the canister be informed via a NNS message as a first step?

This may be enough for that neuron owner to self-correct without exposing identity.

Then there can be a whole set of secondary measures which may ultimately result in removing canister via proposal based on some court proceedings or freezing that canister/neuron until such corrective actions or resolution happen.

I think we need to tread carefully because I’m imagining some use cases where it’s not black and white copyright violation and both parties lay claim to IP…which may require a significant amount of evidence to prove ownership.

You aren't required to own a neuron to deploy a canister.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2021-12-08 22:13:32 UTC | #4

Thanks.  So if there’s no ownership then no one can defend…if there is a court order to shutdown due to copyright/IP infringement then there is little option other than to vote it out…

How are these canisters funded though?

If anyone can create an illegal canister without any risk then this could really pose a problem without proper governance…

Is it possible to make Canisters 'stealth' concerning 'the node(s) that have a copy of it ?   

(Could we have Stealth-Canisters? Meaning: Implement something that encrypts the information linking Canisters to Node-Providers ) 

If possible, this would take the discussion to another level. Node-Providers would never be threatened by DMCA notes ever again. The burden would go over the entire network (not on single node providers)

-------------------------

dostro | 2021-12-08 22:18:15 UTC | #6

@ironlarreh @mechaquan @llbrunoll how about specifically on what we do when we get DMCA notices? I'm thinking we could refine this topic of discussion to *what we do when it happens* instead of *what we do to prevent them*.

The idea here is that it'll probably happen again, so let's eliminate all the friction with getting that defending party a neuron and submitting a proposal to the NNS.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2021-12-08 22:31:43 UTC | #7

Yeah that was where I was trying to go…

Step 0:  as @lastmjs states give node providers plausible deniability

Step 1:  notify the canister owner…who either self-corrects or waits until an official recognized court decision

Step 1a:  canister owner not known jump to step  2

Step 1b:  canister owner challenges and waits for official ruling…appointing representatives if necessary

Step 2:  once official court taken notice arrives at TBD create a proposal to freeze canister

Step 3:  after a set period of time of canister not correcting submit proposal to takedown canister

I don’t think we should create an environment for illegal activity as that will stem adoption and growth.

-------------------------

wpb | 2021-12-09 03:14:50 UTC | #8

It doesn’t seem to me that the burden of submitting an NNS takedown proposal is on the entity serving the DMCA.  They have the law on their side and whoever is served and doesn’t conform will have to deal with the consequences.  It would make more sense for the node operator to submit this type of proposal.  

That said, I think it makes the most sense for the IC ecosystem to band together to protect node operators in a way similar to what Dfinity did on the Nintendo DMCA.  Eventually this type of legal action will need to be addressed in the courts.  I think we need debate in the community (like what has been happening) so everyone who has NNS governance rights can make informed decisions, but eventually this type of topic will need to be put to an NNS vote.  If the DMCA is not honored by that vote, then Dfinity will need to lead the legal effort to defend the decentralization argument.  

I very much like the NNS tooling and governance work process ideas that have been presented in all the deliberation.  However, I think it is appropriate for Dfinity to submit the proposal that they submitted and for them to follow up in support of the long term best interest of the IC based on the outcome of the vote.

I agree with this. I think it would be great to see Nintendo submit the proposal, but why would they care about what we want? They likely have existing processes in place that make issuance of DMCA notices trivial. Expecting a corporation to tailor a process to the IC at this point in time seems unlikely to gain traction.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-09 06:48:36 UTC | #10

IMO when a DCMA or other IP infringement request is received about a publicly posted file, IC should have a team/system that validates the request, and if it is valid, the canister should be notified and then suspended if not responsive (not removed). During that time, the canister would be accessible to the owner, so that they can make changes to fix the issue, but somehow not to the public at large. When the issue is resolved, the NNS can vote to reinstate. I would assume that if it became a common theme on a particular canister, the NNS would not vote to reinstate.

Any damages should be forwarded to the canister owner (not Dfinity, and not the node provider) as it was their bad, because it was in the ‘terms of service’, and the IC did what it could to resolve in a reasonable timeframe once being notified.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-09 07:28:10 UTC | #11

To take this a step further, the canister owner would forward those damages on, to a user of their canister if that user violated the TOS their canister has set (in the case the canister allows for public file uploads or something, causing a DCMA complaint). It could be that a user is causing the issue not the canister owner, and canister owners should know to have a TOS as well for the users. I am not a lawyer or legal advisor.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2021-12-09 13:55:18 UTC | #12

I understand the apparent importance of this conversation but I say don't censor. The protocol should not be concerned with this stuff. It should be unopinionated. What happens when there is political speech, or leaked government documents? 

This is supposed to prevent a central point of censorship but we are diving straight into it. These are the stresses that define the way the network functions. If it's an issue, the nodes can move out of the USA.  Let's just let it play out.

Part of the problem is that there is no meaningful incentive to run nodes (that was one of the concerns raised in the survey/focus study I did recently but got culled from the report I guess).

-------------------------

timo | 2021-12-09 14:24:22 UTC | #13

Just as a point of reference, from a YouTube support website:

> Once the request is validated, YouTube gives the uploader **7 days** to remove the video and avoid a [copyright strike](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000). If they don't, the video is removed after 7 days.

So it may make sense to at least try to inform the canister controller first and wait some time before forcefully uninstalling the canister.

-------------------------

timo | 2021-12-09 14:46:25 UTC | #14

While the idea that the copyright holder makes the proposal directly, with or without a website that removes as much friction as possible, is appealing I am afraid that we actually _want_ to have an indirect method simply so that there is a way to filter invalid takedown requests _before_ they become proposals. 

It would be better if the proposal comes from an entity who has the capacity to validate such claims and if that entity can be identified by its proposer neuron id. And also that the proposal is only made _after_ attempts to contact the canister controller have failed.

Moreover, when validating a takedown it also has to be verified if the request actually comes from the legitimate copyright owner. I don't know how that can be reliably verified. If it cannot be reliably verified then we have to be prepared to make mistakes. If a YouTube video is "removed" I doubt they actually delete the data. Most likely they just make it inaccessible. So in case of a successful appeal they can probably simply undo the take-down. Even if they cannot undo in case of a video it can simply be uploaded again because it doesn't contain state. In case of a canister state would be destroyed by the uninstall action so it cannot be undone. Therefore, if we have to be prepared for appeals then we need first the functionality to hibernate a canister instead of outright uninstalling it.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-09 17:09:29 UTC | #15

So if you post a video of yourself on IC about how you don't want censorship, and IC takes it down, that is censorship.. it's your video to post

If I quit my job and spend 6 months carefully crafting a music album and post it on bandcamp for sale, you are not allowed to download it and post it on the IC for sale without my permission. If the IC takes that canister down for DCMA, that is not censorship, that is removing content that doesn't have the right to be there in the first place. The canister is robbing the content creator of their livelihood.

I still think there's a better process than 'take it down' and put it into a suspended state while the issue is resolve because as timo says above ^ there are state variables that would be lost

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-09 17:31:21 UTC | #16

I think broadening it to beyond DMCA to cover global IP infringement legal processes would be appropriate.  I have concerns about scaling, the overhead of vetting for legitimacy, exposure to litigation/redress and external pressure being exerted in certain jurisdictions and time spent when the IC takes off at webscale.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-09 17:45:34 UTC | #17

Nice one, yes we need a process diagram.. So should there be a vote after the legitimacy review? If it's legitimate, than the vote is on whether to get the node operators in trouble every time, which isn't fair to them. IMO if it's legitimate, the canister should be suspended and the vote should come to reinstate after the appeal has been made by the canister owner that they have resolved the issue. That's just my opinion

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-09 18:29:22 UTC | #18

I was unsure if suspension was technically possible or only removal.  Suspension would be better because of state information.  The legitimacy review was to simply inform voters.  This works well for a clear cut infringement.  If someone were to make a claim that was murky then this becomes very complicated.  A  non-interventionist approach would be to leave the node operator to fend for themselves.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-09 18:25:10 UTC | #19

A more blissful approach.

^^ I feel this is the current approach :rofl:

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-09 18:34:19 UTC | #22

Right, but that’s not really fair to the node operator because they have no recourse except shut the node down and loose their investment or continue to allow damages and have the data center shut them down, and possibly have to pay some legal fine.

If the vote is after an appeal from the canister operator while it is in suspension, than the canister operator can just make the appeal that this was not right for whatever reason, and the community can take time to deliberate on that and allow them to continue on or not. Node operators could then choose to move the node elsewhere, if the community still wants it up and the node operator thinks it’s going to be a problem.

One thing is for sure, the verification process will need its own dept, that’s gonna be some work. The terms would have to be clearly defined, although in the end the NNS will have the final say during appeal.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-10 03:17:38 UTC | #23

Amended with suspension/appeal approach.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-10 18:46:01 UTC | #24

Getting closer! Personally I'm comfortable with no vote before legitimacy review (and possible suspension), as long as those actions are clearly logged and publicly available and based on the terms of service. This way we don't have to moderate 1000s of complaints, but can still review what happened, and the reason for the decisions. Then for the grey area situations, if the canister owner does not agree they could choose to appeal where the NNS would deliberate.

This would also avoid embarrassment to a canister owner if one of their users is causing problems. They wouldn't need to go back to the NNS every time looking like an fool, they could simply resolve the offending file, and be reinstated without having to go to a vote. Maybe if this happens more than 10 times in a month or something then a vote is triggered for more serious consequences. I suppose that is not a process on this diagram yet lol

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-10 19:28:59 UTC | #25

I don't think suspension is supported by the NNS.  Only removal.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-11 06:56:49 UTC | #26

Yeah.. that does make this process difficult doesn't it. I mean it could work with only notification and then deletion, but I just think it's heavy handed for most cases. If the notification time was too long, the node operators are still being left out to dry, so we are left with a shorter time to deletion, and everyone having to vote on every complaint because the penalty is so extreme.

Imagine you went on a 2 week holiday and came back to having your entire business being removed from the universe, with no recovery. There has to be a better way.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-11 12:59:07 UTC | #27

This is an approach that was discussed in the Discord call recognizing that node operators wish to take immediate action and addresses the impact on node operator rewards.  The removal of a canister becomes less pressing and maybe unnecessary.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-11 17:15:07 UTC | #28

Ok very interesting approach.. but like assess business risk, does that mean that if Bob doesn’t have enough money to mount a full legal defence to take on dFinity because he is a solo guitar artist living day to day, but is getting his IP infringed. Does that mean, the network doesn’t care? Or the responsibility in that case falls on the canister owner, who we would hope would care but may not in certain cases.

At a minimum, I would like to see an open and transparent logging system for the ‘assess business risk’ so that these situations are not pushed under the rug. At least then in that case, he could point to a wrong doing, and perhaps we could create an easy to navigate public document explaining how to register valid complaints, in light of not having enough money to hire Alan Dershowitz. Maybe this would require getting an II login, to stop exploitation by bots.

The canister owner should be notified off the bat so they can apply for self-removal of the offending content asap (maybe its just a file not the whole canister) before being wiped off of the galaxy. I like that this diagram takes into account extreme situations (like child exploitation etc) where it would not matter if the canister objects to removal, the entire canister needs to go .. The only problem is, the vote would take 4 days, but it is a heavy penalty that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Hrmmm I still feel there should be terms of service with high bar extreme cases that need to go asap but that is my opinion

The compensation thing would have to be vetted by a legal expert, that’s above my pay grade but I like the idea of putting a built-in incentive on removing illegal content. Obviously this entire thing would have to be vetted by legal experts, which I am not.

Note: This is a response to @dostro's initial post and not the other responses in the thread.

If you're really going to go this route, then wouldn't the "secure" way to do it be requiring the complaining party to obtain a *judgement* as the proper criteria for a violation?

When DFINITY thinks it's a wise idea to play the judge and jury regarding what constitutes a legitimate DCMA notice vs. a frivolous request, then it increases the incentive to just create frivolous requests. 

From the way Foundation members are talking, it's very much starting to seem like the governance system of DFINITY is shaping up to be "innocent until proven guilty", in many cases. 
 
Your choice to take that stance, and I respect it -- it's just going to evaporate the stated value proposition of the Internet Computer to smithereens.

If this is a general template for legal rigor required to declare a Canister "in violation", then in the event that all of these ERC20's are declared to be unregistered securities (and then appeals and court cases start flying back and forth) after the Foundation puts so many resources in to pull off the ETH integration, you're going to see where imprecisions in the takedown standards blow up very hard...

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-12 00:02:00 UTC | #30

If you're placing the "legitimacy review" process above the courts, which you are doing in advocating a process where there is no requirement of a formal judgment against the offending party for a complaint to be declared legitimate, and declaring that the network should have the authority to effectively give what is a legal opinion on a legal complaint, then you're effectively declaring the network to be above the court system in the first place.

As a practical matter, you don't think that some major lawsuits are going to start flying against DFINITY if an entity has a business Canister removed for (example) a DMCA notice, then challenges that notice in court and is found to be not in violation? Especially when Dominic has made (again) repeated public statements suggesting that the Canisters are "unstoppable" on a "censorship resistant" network?

Most of these proposals work out to be super whacky on a variety of fronts when push comes to shove -- @Manu and similar free market approaches make the most sense.

A note to the mathematicians and engineers in here that keep engaging in this fallacy of abstraction, life ain't a damn toy model. It has dynamics.

I like the idea of making Nintendo participate in the network to enact content moderation and this could actually turn to be a huge incentive for adoption as you mention, but for this to be taken seriously wouldn't you need to eliminate liable agents (perhaps as @lastmjs has been suggesting for node operators)? Otherwise what keeps Nintendo from just pursuing either the node operator or Dfinity legally instead of playing the on-chain governance game?

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-12 00:36:31 UTC | #33

They'd never do it, not only cause DMCA are spammed by legal teams with no tech background other than sending emails but also cause to enforce their will they should buy millions worth of ICP so they'd rather take it to court.

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-12 00:48:49 UTC | #34

The idea is precisely to make it impossible for them to bring it to court, the same way it's impossible to bring a BTC miner to court... their only alternative would be to attempt an nns proposal and hope the community sides with them.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-12 03:05:43 UTC | #35

I dont think its that easy for 2 reasons:

1) When a miner processes a transaction he only knows address x wants to send some btc to address y, once its confirmed he can't revert it, so even if somehow law enforcement finds out that transaction was linked to illegal activities the miner can't possibly revert the state of the whole blockchain, on the other hand nodes have 2 choices: remove the content somehow or be shut down.

2) Even if in the future miners are taken in court they would have methods to prevent that such as hiding behind a VPN or TOR, the fact you can run a miner at your home also helps, depending on the country DMCA claims to private IPs are useless, e.g you can seed torrent easily using your home connection, try doing the same on a dedicated server hosted in a 1st world country and you'll get shut down in a couple weeks. IC nodes are hosted in the most regulated infrastructure there is for this kind of stuff and while it is an advantage cause it grants fast and reliable connections and consistent uptime it also mean they can be kicked from the data center anytime they are seen as a liability.

In the past days there have been discussions to add canisters reshuffling and other safety measures to ensure nodes aren't liable for the content they host, but those are long term goals and it also seems they could cause governments to ban IC from what I've read.

The current situation is less than ideal and I think I already have an idea of what the foundation will have to do: comply with DMCA to preserve the IC's future.
The IC is not mature and adopted enough to be a full web 3.0 infrastructure that only complies with the community's decisions, just like Satoshi was worried about BTC being used on Silk Road, Dfinity is worried about CP and DMCAs cause they could ruin the IC's reputation and possibly result in bans in some countries, which would kill adoption and the dream of a blockchain singularity.

Its a shame cause I envisioned web 3.0 to be better in all aspects than web 2.0, but right now I have a feeling it will only be different, yes there will be some additions like SocialFi, added security and some controversial sites like "Parler" will be able to exist, but at the same time we might lose illegal streaming sites, some of you might be okay with this, but for me it is a huge loss, illegal streaming has tangibly improved the way we consume media, its only thanks to Torrent and similar services if today we have Netflix, Spotify, etc... for a small monthly fee, if web 3.0 means the entertainement industry will be able to reinstate their anti consumer monopoly then I'm not sure I want it as much as I did.

I'm okay with the IC being banned out of fear initially though, the point of revolutionary technology is that banning it or going against it ends up being inefficient and counter-productive, because it's the inevitable next step, and it must challenge obsolete, inefficient systems. I'm kind of demoralized at how detached many of the people involved in the project seem to be from this value, and the spirit of crypto in general tbh. The tech is still amazing and the devs definitely deserve the recognition for it. But I agree, it seems it could end up being a lot different than I thought.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-12 04:01:28 UTC | #37

I don't think people are reacting because they are detached.  I think it is an appreciation of the perilous position a node operator is left in with zero legal cover.  The technology is evolving.  It is just not there yet, but the DMCA litigation, notifications and legal teams are.  Unfortunate, but it is what it is.

-------------------------

mechaquan | 2021-12-12 08:59:15 UTC | #38

Dude I’m talking about “internationally” accepted illegal activity…IP theft, terrorism, and child exploitation…and possibly malicious canisters that seek to harm the IC…

The point here is that the community need to draw that line and implement a solution to deal with it.

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-13 00:03:15 UTC | #39

I think what were talking about here is handling certain pre-court requests, so that we can take care of some obvious issues internally (self-govern) before they are forced to bring more un-nessasary heat and clog up the OG court system. I understand that would bring some risk, but that's what a responsible system should do IMO, and everything should be documented so the process could be perfected. We're just spitballing the best actual way that might actually work, but yeah it's not easy, and there's no way everyone will be happy. If there was an actual court order, I'm not sure what a vote would be about. It needs to come down, or the nodes will go down.

It would be great to have some clear direction on this from top top, so that I can decide if I actually want to dev a larger project on this platform. Once I deploy the app, my reputation is on the line as well, even if it's another canisters fault. It's fine for experimental projects with no users but if you were actually going to go for it, it feels like you could get caught in a trap rn to me anyways. Just like the node operators are feeling currently.

northman | 2021-12-13 02:47:40 UTC | #40

In the DMCA thread, I posted a process model to ensure the node operators maintain their reward in the event of a takedown order and elect to takedown the node - without a canister removal.  If the takedown notice goes to the node operator, does anyone know what legal basis would be for the NNS to take action to remove content if they are not a party to the request.  Good hygene?  How does liability unfold?  What is the Foundations exposure in all of this?  Is the foundation going to advance a legal opinion and share with the community?  A few questions.

I don't think we would be privy to the Business Risk Assessment of a Node Operator.  It would likely  contain solicitor-client privileged information or possibly an assessment of losing a prime candidate in their own facility who is unhappy with the stance.  While, this may or may not be a valid reason to take down a node - an operator could decide for their own reasons to abandon the node and its reward and keep their other client happy.  

In the compensation proposal the node would have to substantiate the rationale for the action with sufficient detail for the NNS to agree to compensate..  Regarding the cansister owner notification.  a notice could be posted, but in many cases one does not know to whom a canister belongs.  That is why in the NNS stream there is the "Request for Self-Removal".   The NNS stream is less time critical in situations where the node operator has taken the node down but has not deleted the state.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-12-14 07:48:12 UTC | #43

Is it bad to just hide which canisters a node hosts?

It costs nothing for Nintendo to email a DMCA takedown notice to a node provider. They could just email one after another, scare them all, and take down a bunch of nodes.

Seems like it'd be safer to make it so Nintendo doesn't even know who to email.

The thing about music is that it was supported by patrons and performance residencies until the advent of mass-produced recordings. During this period people copied sheet music but it wasn't considered illegal. 

Then record companies productised music recordings for 50 years and copying music became "theft".

Then the internet came along. All the money went out of recordings and we are back to patrons and performance again. Bandcamp being a patron-type site like Patreon. Payment for digital content of any kind is always voluntary. There is no point in supporting digital copyright. I feel like this was established 20 years ago. 

I bought maybe 30 albums and pirated and distributed hundreds before Spotify came along - as a  below-median income worker, paying for music was impossible. Same for software and movies. I've put thousands of hours into hundreds of free podcasts with pirated software. People pirate because they can't pay rather than because they "just don't want to". 
Copyright is designed to support a sales-based business model but digital media has already moved on. SaaS, support, consulting, and other downstream revenue. Music moved on with Spotify. TV and movies with Netflix. 
People will pirate everything on the IC. They'll use it as a storage layer and have a proxy with an index of content serve users. But it won't be popular because the current web works so well for that already. Piracy itself is an institution and necessary means of democratising culture and technology.

Further to this point. between 1999 & 2003 my wage was between $4.65 and $5.50 NZ an hour ($2.25 - $2.75 US). $30 for a CD was a weeks wage for a youth worker. Photoshop was $1200. That's a year of saving, never spending any money ever and it means foregoing a car. Then you become an adult with rent, bills. That's why the digital piracy debate didn't have legs. Everyone is too poor. That was part of the reason the pirate parties became a thing globally.

This so much, without piracy the IC can't and won't be the future of the internet.

Then these megacorps will just email everyone, even people who have nothing to do with the IP infringement, scare the hell out of dozens of node operators, and start a panic. From my research, most node operators are incorporated in some way. That means liabilities and insurance. Nobody likes getting letters signed by a dozen lawyers, especially when that letter requires you to contact your own attorney(s) and pay out a few thousand dollars for their opinion on an esoteric and emerging legal issue.

There is a proper party in this case, and that party voluntarily complied with the demand letter, so the issue resolved itself. It needs to be easier for the proper party to get actual notice of any legal proceeding, not more difficult for the claimant to reach that party. As megacorps have shown, they are ready, willing, and able to attack the whole. Would it stand up in court? I don't know and I don't want to find out. As a wizened law professor once chided me, "Don't be a test case." 

A few thousand darker steps down this road we find issues of child abuse and pronography - government agencies with subpoenas coming in to resolve criminal issues, not civil ones. Where do we want those subpoenas to go? I want them to go to those responsible, not the collective.

Decentralization is about efficiency; it is not efficient to have the NNS voting on civil litigation matters. Legal matters are like Pringles(TM): you cannot have just one.

MisterSignal has the right idea here: they need to have a judgement before they come to the NNS for enforcement.

Even in that, responding to pretrial motions as the improper party admits some level of liability, which I do not believe the Dfinity Organization had in this matter. Allowing yourself to be dragged into a legal dispute is a huge mistake, especially when you have nothing to gain and everything to lose. I think it was a mistake to ever raise the vote, instead of telling Nintendo to go do their own dirty work. That was not an NNS issue, nor should it ever be seen as one. Is it a good idea to have a system in place for dealing with these issues moving forward? Yes. And that system should be getting the proper parties together, and then stepping back to do its job, which is governance, not assuming liability for user actions.

I am not mad that my Mario64 "Decentralized any%" speedrun WR is now illegitimate; I am heartbroken. This was my one shot to make it on the SR.com leader boards ;-;

I'll dive into DMCA laws and get a more informed opinion this week, but that WR is gone forever.

I'm sorry to hear that Bingo. That would have been pretty legit

Check out what IPFS is doing with DMCA's: https://ipfs.io/legal/

They also have a code of conduct: https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md

i totally agree with this suggestion we can create error zones where all dmca related clutters will be frozen restrict access for a period of time it will be reopened when there is a correct response between the two parties.
obviously dmca is almost similar to nft vulnerability and we can wait when all entities are nft we can be more clear in future copyright protection
