Hi everyone. I'm learning to deploy canisters for my job. I want to do a replica of [minter](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai) and [ledger](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai) canisters. 

I was able to deploy both with initial template index.ts:
```
import { Canister, query, text } from 'azle';

export default Canister({
    greet: query([text], text, (name) => {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    })
})
```

and both works perfect. 

Now I'm trying to get exactly the same methods than the canisters I mentioned before, but I can only found de .did and type files (in the same url I shared). And when i deploy the canister, the `index.ts` overwrites the .did file.

Anyone knows where can I find this index.ts file for both canisters or how can I deploy it with .did only?

What does your `dfx.json` look like? 

I assume that you have an additional canister that you are deploying that might be listed like this:

```
"azle_hello_world": {
            "type": "custom",
            "main": "src/index.ts",
            "candid": "src/index.did",
            "build": "npx azle azle_hello_world",
            "wasm": ".azle/azle_hello_world/azle_hello_world.wasm",
            "gzip": true
}
```
I assume that you do not need this and can remove it from being listed in your `dfx.json` and delete any related files.
