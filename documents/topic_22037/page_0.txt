Why http_response accept  base64 image size only 22 kb not more then 22 kb?
i tried to get base64 25 kb image from http_request method #post but it's give me an error **trapped: stack overflow**. when i resize in 22 kb image it's working fine without error.
is there any solution for receive more then 22 kb base64 image?
