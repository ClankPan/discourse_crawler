Problem : If I am using my iPhone to browse, I have to keep using safari which seems slow because it’s repetitive. Just a personal experience. If I’m on safari I want to look up new stuff. 

Upon deployment, IcPeak was requesting for the possibility of the forum to be on an app. Similar to IG, or Fb . That way when a user wants to discuss on the forum they open the app. 

Question for developers..Does such a platform exist. And if so can we Publicize it. It would attract more people to participate in discussion. 

I feel like that is an easier way for newbies to adjust to this fast moving field.
