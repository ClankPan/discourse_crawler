Hello everyone,

When using the `query` or `update` macro to annotate a method, we can specify a guard for them, which can perform some auxiliary tasks such as verification or authorization before executing the method. So,my question is, does this guard consume cycles?
```
#[query(guard = "verify")]
pub async fn do_somthing(  
) -> Result<（）, Error> {}

```
