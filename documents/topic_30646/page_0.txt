when i try to delete a (stopped) canister, i get the result below.

How do i delete a canister and retrieve the cycles?

```
dfx canister delete Bazar_backend --ic

when i check the staus, the canister has started again and about 0.005T cycles are gone

What `dfx` version are you using? Have you upgraded to version `0.20.0`?

-------------------------

richards | 2024-05-12 06:29:52 UTC | #3

Yes, i upgraded to 0.20.0

Thank you for the confirmation. We will check and get back to you.

That's a problem with dfx. Sorry about that. I know how to solve it but haven't gotten around to fixing it yet. 

Workaround for the meantime:
Call `dfx canister --wallet <canister to delete> deposit-cycles --ic $(dfx identity --ic get-wallet) <cycles amount>`. This will use the wallet that was installed in the canister you want to delete to send cycles to your actual cycles wallet. Given that you have 2.9T cycles in your canister you probably can use `2.8T` or `2.7T` in place of `<cycles amount`.
After withdrawing cycles manually you should be able to delete the canister with the `--no-withdrawal` flag, which will not try to withdraw cycles

Does that also include withdrawing frozen threshold?

-------------------------

Severin | 2024-05-13 13:21:49 UTC | #7

Yes. `dfx` sets the freezing threshold to 0 before attempting to withdraw, so any previously reserved cycles are free to withdraw
