Unknown issue returning an invalid signature from replica error when installing specific packages from mops.

I spoke to @zenvoich about the issue in this github thread but we couldn't locate the cause. 
I noticed the issue after a recent update to the mops backend canister which @zenvoich said was a simple deployment with dfx `0.22.0` and moc `0.12.0`.

#### steps to recreate
```bash
mkdir test-mops
cd test-mops
mops init
mops add serde
```
