@harrison has come up with what is in my opinion a brilliant potential path for dealing with the weighty censorship issues that the community has been facing since the Super Mario 64 incident. Please weigh in on this proposal. Various people have been discussing this behind the scenes but it's time to bring it to light. Let's see if this could work.

The idea is to move censorship to the boundary nodes. We force all canister interaction through these nodes, and we make them legally accountable for the content that they allow to be served to their clients. If a boundary node operator receives a DMCA request (or any other legal request), they have the option of blocking the offending canister according to their own internal decision making process.

To avoid consolidation of censorship power into one main tyrannical censor, anyone should be allowed to run a boundary node. Obviously all of the boundary node code should be open source. But the boundary nodes would remain separate from the IC protocols, not participating in consensus, only serving as the gateways to the Internet Computer network.

This idea may be a great compromise between those who want total censorship-resistance and those who want to make sure harmful content can be stopped. The core IC protocols would remain censorship-resistant, and anyone could spin up boundary nodes to serve content. But each boundary node would need to find a place in this world to operate. Considering each boundary node instance will not inherit the decentralization properties of the IC, it may be difficult to run a non-legally-compliant node, but may still be possible.

For example, DFINITY may continue running the small number of boundary nodes that they currently run at `ic0.app`. But we may also see other boundary nodes at `ic1.app`, `ic2.app`, or any other domain name. Those running the boundary nodes will need to interface with the centralized world to provide their services. If DFINITY doesn't do a good job, then other interested parties may spin up boundary nodes. We may see multiple boundary node operators competing to offer the best gateways into the network.

Combining boundary node censors with [plausible deniability for node operators](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/plausible-deniability-for-node-operators/9491), we may move the responsibility for dealing with most of the less-egregious legal issues from the node operators and the NNS to the boundary nodes. They can take the brunt force of legal complexities, and a decentralized network of boundary nodes can serve the people's varying interests. More existential issues, such as a Silk Road 2, may require much more contentious action, such as an NNS vote. But boundary node censors may be a stop-gap solution that can help us get to the next step in figuring out what censorship-resistance on the Internet Computer means.

We need to act quickly. Super Mario 64 was just the beginning.

I wholeheartedly agree, its not even over yet, Mario is back and Pokemon is following him, its just a matter of times before we see a new proposal.

I think @harrison proposal is a good compromise, I only have 1 question, would boundary nodes still receive ICPs for their work, if so we need a way to reward nodes with better hw, connection more than bad ones, not only to provide a better experience but also to limit the amount of minted ICP, right now nodes are limited by the foundation mainly to counter inflation, if anyone could host a node on a rasperberry inflation would skyrocket.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-14 00:10:13 UTC | #3

Then you force technical IT server-managing people to also be legal experts and takedown request-parsers. They better be paid well otherwise we will end up with too few boundary nodes for high-bandwidth apps. I prefer the IC to handle this for node operators, in a crypto court system like Kleros. 

This is maybe an immediate interim solution but not an elegant one.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2021-12-14 00:12:55 UTC | #4

How does this solve the issue of child porn being uploaded to the IC? Because this will happen. It only solves the issue of ordinary node providers not being responsible for it. Although this isn't entirely clear. 

So then what is the profile of a boundary node provider? Honestly I am not sure who on earth would want to be a boundary node provider. It is either legal risk from governments or a risk of loss of revenue if they go offline.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-17 02:10:38 UTC | #5

IRL service providers just shut down the service if there is a DMCA violation, they dont verify anything, its up to the offended party to contest it and if there is a dispute it goes to court.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-14 00:12:51 UTC | #6

Then trolls will just DMCA everything on the IC.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-14 00:14:07 UTC | #7

CP is easier to deal with and can be banned by the NNS, thats cause its evident something either is CP or not, DMCA is abusable and copyright laws aren't simple, thats why they are settled in court by experts.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-14 00:14:30 UTC | #8

This is a valid concern.

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 00:18:23 UTC | #9

This approach is used very successfully by IPFS. See https://ipfs.io/legal/. IPFS.io is an IPFS gateway run by Protocol Labs that has it's own content policy, however anybody else can run an IPFS gateway (for example Fleek has it's own IPFS gateway), and we can have our own separate content policy, just as anyone else in the world can run an IPFS gateway and set their own policy (or decide to have none). The important part is that the censorship happens above the core protocol. Both IPFS and Filecoin protocols do not have any censorship at the protocol level - it is all handled at the gateway level, and it works great.

 My idea is essentially for the IC to adopt the exact same approach.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-12-14 00:22:03 UTC | #10

Are boundary nodes equipped to deal with tons of DMCA take down requests? Do they have any incentive to not automatically take down everything that has a takedown request and adjudicate it later?

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-14 00:24:03 UTC | #11

Analogous also to [Arweave Wiki Content-Policies (arwiki.wiki)](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/content-policies#toc_Gateways)
This is the way to go.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2021-12-14 00:23:41 UTC | #12

How would you propose enforcing this policy to limit the power of the NNS? Currently the NNS has the power to do anything. 

For IPFS, do they choose (however IPFS governance works) not to censor at the protocol level or is it not possible to censor at the protocol level?

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 00:36:49 UTC | #13

It's not possible. Which is the way it should be for all protocols.

My recommendation regarding limiting the power of the NNS would be that after the boundary nodes are decentralized, a proposal should be submitted/voted on that essentially removes the ability for the NNS to vote canisters off the network. Therefore making it impossible for the IC protocol to censor.

-------------------------

rubenhorne | 2021-12-14 00:23:37 UTC | #14

Can we clarify what boundary nodes do in the first place? In my limited understanding, they are a "middle man" for data traffic between a subnet and an end user. What are their speed requirements compared to a node in a subnet? How many boundary nodes do we currently have on the internet computer? Would running a boundary node be appealing anymore with these added complexities? How easy is it for a boundary node to censor the content they serve? 

Agreed that we need interim solutions as we work to decentralize the network and get plausible deniability online for nodes.

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 00:32:21 UTC | #15

As someone who runs one of the largest IPFS gateways, I can confidently say that yes it is quite easy to deal with. We've been running an IPFS gateway for over 2 years that does 600TB of data transfer a month, and we've actually never received a DMCA. Bc one thing to keep in mind is similar to Web2 and IPFS, the first line of defense will always be the user facing app/interface/url. For example if something gets posted on DSCVR that infringes, the DMCA is going to go to DSCVR first, not the Boundary Node/Gateway operator. It typically would only then go to the Boundary Node/Gateway operator if the app/interface didn't listen. 

The main issue with the IC right now is the foundation serves all content for the entire IC via ic0.app. So if you solve that problem by decentralizing the boundary nodes and allowing anyone to run a gateway, then you can get rid of the NNS/protocol having anything to do with censorship, which is how it needs to be for the IC to have any chance at succeeding.

-------------------------

shayaaa | 2021-12-14 00:36:04 UTC | #16

In the case of DSCVR, the only reason it’s not getting to the node provider is because they are a “good actor.” Would it be safe to assume anyone putting child porn or something similar on the IC won’t be as cooperative?

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 00:42:43 UTC | #17

Thats a fair assumption. But in that case as I mentioned it could be handled by the gateways or other layers above the protocol as second and third lines of defense. Which is very similar to how Web2 works (if the app/site doesn't listen, typically then it will go to AWS or whatever platform the content is hosted on, or to DNS, or the app stores, etc.). And the system doesn't work in 100% of instances but that's ok. The important part is the internet itself isn't involved in censoring/keeping things off the internet completely. It's always handled above the base layer. Censoring at the base layer is a death sentence for the IC.

-------------------------

dostro | 2021-12-14 00:53:04 UTC | #18

I’m interested to explore this idea, sounds quite promising and elegant. 

One thing to remember is that even if canister takedowns are removed as a proposal type, I don’t believe it’s necessarily permanent as it could always get voted back.

-------------------------

jorgenbuilder | 2021-12-14 00:53:17 UTC | #19

Makes a lot of sense, thanks Harrison and Jordan for sharing. Maybe early to say, but this feels like something very worthy of the community pushing for. Would be great to see consensus develop, curious to see if some of the folks with strong opinions agree.

One philosophical note--if a proposal passed to remove NNS power to censor, could it not be compelled to just put that functionality back in the future?

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 01:01:58 UTC | #20

it could. but that's true of any protocol with on chain governance, the IC is not unique in that regard. 

i think the bigger issue is the foundation's messaging/culture/stance around the issue. with any other web3 protocol, it is very well understood that censorship at the protocol level is absolutely unacceptable and goes against everything Web3 stands for. and if any protocol voted to start censoring, I think it's well understood that most of that protocols community would leave the community (or fork the project and re-launch it without censorship), and the original protocol would die. I think the same would happen to the IC if they don't remove it, or if it was ever voted back in.

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-14 01:05:41 UTC | #21

I'm thinking that in the future, if the IC becomes decentralized and millions of people adopt it, voting power will be so granular that it would be absurdly difficult to agree on things that aren't obviously for the good of all parties, such as technical upgrades. So it would be technically possible but practically unlikely, which is virtually the same principle at play in BTC... it's technically possible to exclude legitimate transactions from the ledger but practically unlikely.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2021-12-14 01:07:05 UTC | #22

> I can confidently say that yes it is quite easy to deal with. We’ve been running an IPFS gateway for over 2 years that does 600TB of data transfer a month, and we’ve actually never received a DMCA.

DMCA arising from ordinary course of business or DMCA being filtered by apps might be manageable. Another vulnerability would be bad actors spamming network with DMCA content directly from canisters. In this situation how would a Boundary node be able to handle thousands of canisters with DMCA content constantly popping up?

[/quote]

Great initiative Harrison and Jordan - sounds like a pragmatic solution in the short term! 
If the authorities target the gateway rather than the network we should be fine 90% of the time. 

My question is about the other 10%. I believe the foundation KYC's node operators, so ultimately if a company, say Nintendo, wanted some information taken down, could  they not ask the foundation for the information relating to a node provider who is hosting the canister? 

I feel like without the ability to run nodes anonymously, there will always be the threat of censorship. Whereas FileCoin is highly decentralised and it would be virtually impossible to stop the network from hosting content, not sure this is the case with small groups of nodes that form a consensus on a subnet.

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 01:10:51 UTC | #24

Someone could do that on IPFS too. Hasn't happened yet. And the DMCA would come with canister ID's presumably in that scenario so would be easy to just blacklist those from the gateway. Plus it would be costly for an attacker to do that. So I just don't see it as a high probability problem that's worth factoring in

-------------------------

dfisher | 2021-12-14 01:11:05 UTC | #25

Given what you are talking about is messaging/culture/stance, I think the next step here would be for someone at Dfinity to opine on your proposal.

-------------------------

harrison | 2021-12-14 01:12:12 UTC | #26

Yes I definitely agree that there should be a part 2 to this solution that involves node shuffling and other technical measures to take liability off node operators completely

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 01:15:40 UTC | #27

I think this is a good compromise that will allow us to address an urgent need. I don’t believe this fully addresses the issues that some have raised regarding the potential pitfalls of on-chain governance but we need to move forward and improve as we go along. I see no reason why we need to address everything as one monolithic problem.

-------------------------

talkingant | 2021-12-14 01:21:10 UTC | #28

In 2016, Google [reported receiving 2 million DMCA notices](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2016/03/07/how-many-copyright-takedown-notices-does-google.html) per day. If the IC is to scale to a global platform, whatever content management method we use must also scale.

-------------------------

Maxfinity | 2021-12-14 01:33:55 UTC | #29

Another approach could be to separate the data layer from the compute layer, and distributing the data across many laptop-grade nodes.

-------------------------

crabtr26 | 2021-12-14 01:36:05 UTC | #30

I love this idea. This is definitely the way. Thanks Harrison and Jordan for keeping the discussion going!

-------------------------

aSpace1 | 2021-12-14 02:21:39 UTC | #31

I don't think that is a good idea and potentially it may do more harm than good. You can not create digital laws, digital law enforcement, digital judges, and jury.
Laws are **spider webs through which the big flies pass and the little ones get caught** . Honore de Balzac
Solutions must be practical, can be implemented everywhere. Perhaps to hold the person(s) accountable in the event of foul play and after all whoever uploads stolen materials or child photography should be held accountable! To do so perhaps prior to uploading documents the person should sign a document digitally that the person is 100% responsible and in compliance with.....This can be NFT and hidden from everyone and can be requested from courts or something like that!

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-14 02:54:35 UTC | #32

Thank you for this.  Here are my thoughts - not a legal opinion.

If a boundary node is going to be a “dumb router” then boundary node ownership and node ownership would have to be mutually exclusive so that in the event a boundary node operator were to be served with a takedown request they could certify they (as a corporate entity)  do not have the offending content.  The boundary node is basically a router with bits flowing through it.  Hopefully, the content coming to the boundary is encrypted and not with a persistent cache.    

If boundary node ownership is mutually exclusive to node ownership, I do not see how implementing a filtering policy would solve the issue of liability for node operators.  The boundary operator does not have control of content.  Node operators are still housing the canister with the offending intellectual property which may still be served to other canisters.  A lawyer would likely file a takedown request with the boundary node provider, the node provider and the data centre operator.
 
Enabling the boundary operator to filter content still does not allow the boundary node operator to certify that the content is no longer accessible (i.e. inter canister communication).  In some situations blocking a site may be sufficient but not in all cases (an old video game vs a blockbuster movie).
  
As long as the infringing content can be identified as being on node, it will be ripe for litigation.

With respect to boundary node operator's responsibilities, I find it difficult to imagine a Boundary node operator who would wants to sign up for the responsibility of arbitrating DMCA requests and making them legally accountable for the content that they allow to be served.  Presently, they risk being sued as part of a DMCA action and want to avoid this.  I cannot imagine a boundary node operator signing up to be sued by the community for failure to take appropriate action.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-14 02:58:49 UTC | #33

Even if a person were to sign a document, the node operator serving the content remains legally exposed.  Also, the anonymous nature of the platform would make certifying data difficult.

-------------------------

[quote="northman, post:32, topic:9640"]
I do not see how implementing a filtering policy would solve the issue of liability for node operators.
[/quote]

My understanding is that the filtering policy isn't supposed to make storage node operators not liable, it's supposed to make boundary node operators autonomous in their response to DMCAs, that is they can decide to comply or to ignore and that's their own choice. Note that the Nintendo takedown notice was sent to a boundary node operator ([here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/plausible-deniability-for-node-operators/9491/66)), not to a storage node. 
The idea is to then use to be discussed technical solutions (node shuffling, secure enclaves, etc..) to make other types of nodes not liable.

I want to give a meta-comment on my **personal silence** on this thread:

1. **I do read closely all of these threads**, and I know many at foundation do as well. Many times these threads influence thinking. We are listening.

2. **I am personally silent because I do not feel appropriately confident in my own expertise or thinking  yet**, so I am letting my own opinions brew based on the healthy conversation here and on other threads.

3. **Because of my role on the foundation (and especially in the developer forum), I am careful about how many questions, off-the-cuff proposals, or suggestions I pose without sufficient confidence to back them up.** I would hate for people to read my ignorance or uncertainly as the Foundation's ignorance or uncertainty. In the past, even when I caveat when I am speaking as an individual neuron holder/voter, I have found my own words copy/pasted as the foundation's stance. I know other DFINITY members take similar care.

4. The **DFINITY foundation has been actively trying to give the community more breathing room** to digest, debate, and express themselves. **That is why I sometimes let threads get momentum before even jumping in.**

Why did I write those 4 points? Because I want to signal that my silence does not mean I, Diego, am unengaged. I am as interested as all of you.

SpiderMonkey | 2021-12-14 05:53:23 UTC | #37

Overall I like this Idea! Great job Harrison and Jordan! It does seem to be a good first start. Then maybe something like Node shuffling, as Jordan has discussed previously, can be added later to add plausible deniability correct? In my limited understanding, I am curious if it would be possible to have that same effect for the discussed boundary nodes? Something to reduce risk for all parties involved.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2021-12-14 06:21:29 UTC | #38

This is an excellent proposal which, in combination with node shuffling, should provide substantial censorship resistance while avoiding dangers inherent in having an active censor at core protocol level. In responding to  these proposals, it is wise not to make the best the enemy of the good. There are no perfect solutions to these issues because, while there is unanimity on the need to weed out certain content, nobody has discovered a way to do so without also threatening legitimate content that might offend certain groups or be illegal in particular jurisdictions, just like nobody has found a way to kill all cancer cells without also damaging a few healthy ones. The point is to target as best we can, so that as much legitimate information as possible can flourish censorship-free on the Internet Computer blockchain.

-------------------------

NickM | 2021-12-14 08:39:04 UTC | #39

Thank you, @harrison for proposing this solution.

IMO, the IC Community is exceptionally fortunate to have people with this level of practical experience who are also prepared to share those experiences. Again, thank you.

Thank you, @lastmjs from signposting the community to the proposal.

@diegop, thank you for describing your position in the post earlier; another great example of the honest responsibility you give to the fine line between Foundation, Community and Development.

@alexa.smith It appears Dfinity and the IC do not need to re-invent the wheel. If this requires a vote, let's do it. If not, what is required for practical implementation?

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 08:55:37 UTC | #40

This is the only path forward. The same thing happens in Bitcoin. There's a US mining pool that won't mine OFAC blacklisted addresses. Many other miners do but it's the choice of the miners not the protocol which is neutral.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 09:09:02 UTC | #41

How does HTTP solve that problem? It doesn't. Let app devs, browser devs, node providers, governments, police forces and any other number of people that almost unilaterally detest that content tackle that issue. Our job is to deliver a globally trusted Web 3.0 platform not to be the world's police.

-------------------------

Manu | 2021-12-14 10:22:46 UTC | #42

I proposed something very similar in your [previous thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/plausible-deniability-for-node-operators/9491/67?u=manu) @lastmjs, I think this is a promising approach. This would really help with "canister x is legal in country A but not country B" type of cases. 

And I think the NNS should still have the power to remove canisters, which could be used for cases where the entire IC community agrees that it should be removed.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 10:32:14 UTC | #43

Hey man. If you still support the NNS being able to censor, how do you envisage the network will deal with this situation?

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-14 10:36:53 UTC | #44

I like the reasoning behind it (separating the boundary nodes out because they are not part of consensus)
Issues I see: 
There would have to be way more boundary nodes, otherwise it becomes too easy to mess with.
There should have to be some help from the wider community (Dfinity/ICA) if boundary nodes have to be on the forefront of legal defense, they'll think twice about the hassle signing up/staying.
This seems to work for general censorship (legal in country A, illegal in country B) but might be difficult for things like IP, where essentially all countries where boundary nodes are (rn) would agree end they'll all have to block it anyway.

Still the NNS should retain the power to remove canisters, imo. What about people stealing content within the IC, might be early now but might come up in the future.

-------------------------

faraz | 2021-12-14 10:43:50 UTC | #45



Not clear on what is being achieved here by the boundary node proposal.
Neither 
 a -  the content gets taken down
Nor
 b -  is the access blocked from a particular a geography. 


I think there is a misconception that ALL requests from a geography absolutely must be routed via a particular boundary node.  It's definitely not the case.  it is trivial and possible to route US traffic via a European boundary node. This routinely happens when boundary nodes are being updated/offline.

  I am pretty sure it is not that easy to circumvent DCMA by "fixing" DNS records. DNS fudging might put ic0.app domain at risk !

-------------------------

Manu | 2021-12-14 10:44:52 UTC | #46

Well one proposal should be able to remove any amount of canisters, so uploaded 1000 times does not necessarily mean 1000 different proposals. 

That being said, it's a bit of an odd question: the problem you're sketching is a difficult case whether the NNS can remove canisters or not, so it's not very related. How would you propose to solve that problem?

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 10:50:02 UTC | #47

I don't have a solution and I don't think there is one that doesn't involve centralisation and capture TBH. 

If you have a rule that you can still censor at protocol level - even with a *really* high bar - it will result in an amount of decision-making for the NNS that would be completely impractical to execute without extremely short vote times and extremely low participation or devolution to an authority accountable to the NNS. Both those paths lead to centralisation.

-------------------------

Manu | 2021-12-14 10:50:13 UTC | #48

@faraz  I think you may have missed this part
> For example, DFINITY may continue running the small number of boundary nodes that they currently run at `ic0.app` . But we may also see other boundary nodes at `ic1.app` , `ic2.app` , or any other domain name. Those running the boundary nodes will need to interface with the centralized world to provide their services. If DFINITY doesn’t do a good job, then other interested parties may spin up boundary nodes. We may see multiple boundary node operators competing to offer the best gateways into the network.

So there are different boundary nodes with different domains that can make personal choices about what content they want to serve, which may also help them comply with the law applicable to that boundary node, and prevent take downs.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-14 10:58:36 UTC | #49

If boundary nodes operators have the power to decide what's blacklisted and what not, couldn't this end up opening a new can of worms? Considering the path of least resistance would be: if in doubt, blacklist.
They would become something like gate-keepers, right?
IMHO this works only if we try getting boundary nodes up in a big scale and geographically spread out enough to stand a chance.

-------------------------

stopak | 2021-12-14 11:07:09 UTC | #50

Hi everyone, 

I will give you another perspective from the point of view of tokens and NFTs which is really important to this discussion. 

The only reason that ETH or ICPunks have value is that we are certain that it cannot be stolen or switched offline. If there is a possibility that any people by voting can switch of canister then it means that any assets on the IC are NOT SAFE and should not be TRUSTED as a value storage. 

Any solution that enables people to store value (DEFI, NFTs, Lending and such) cannot really operate in an environment that poses a risk of "loosing" all stored funds. Even if they are not lost and just "offline" it still means they are no better than any centralized solution and people that stored their assets have no longer access to them (welcome to CEX world).

The proposal to separate the boundary nodes and protocol itself makes a lot of sense, as we know in the future IC should exist independently from the DFINITY foundation, furthermore most of the voting power should also be distributed among network participants. If the option to switch canisters off remains we risk creating "centralized blockchain" that tries to mask itself as the decentralized. Any party that is able to get more than 50% votes can (and will if possible) switch off canisters arbitrarily, for any "valid" reason. It would be similar to amazon switching off competition just because it can.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-14 11:08:38 UTC | #51

Agreed, native BTC and ETH integration will make this issue even worse.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-14 11:13:05 UTC | #52

But can't 51% of validators "censor" in any other blockchain aswell?

-------------------------

stopak | 2021-12-14 11:13:48 UTC | #53

They can censor transactions, or make a hardfork. However the value still remains.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-14 11:15:01 UTC | #54

Yes this is absolutely spot on.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-14 11:16:34 UTC | #55

but does the value really remain? if the whole network updates, and you don't? like the "value" of ETC compared to ETH ?

-------------------------

Manu | 2021-12-14 11:17:59 UTC | #56

I disagree pretty strongly. On ETH, the miners can do whatever they want. If they agree that something should be rolled back or be removed or so, they can do that. An example is the ETH-ETC hardfork, where they just chose to change the rules.  

In the internet computer, the community holds this power, via the NNS. I think that's better than just the miners having this power. And if the community does not want to remove canisters, then they can just vote "no" on all removal proposals, and nothing will ever be removed from the internet computer. 

Giving boundary nodes additionally the option to maintain a blocklist does not mean that people "lose funds". It just means that this specific boundary does not serve certain things, but you can try a different boundary node.

-------------------------

stopak | 2021-12-14 11:21:41 UTC | #57

We have a great example in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Cash. As the whole blockchain is available for everyone when fork happens all the data remains. Of course given time forks lost its value in comparison to original Bitcoin. However they had a possibility to choose to separate from main network and create their own, which retains all data previous to the fork (like in Futurama with blackjack and hookers ;)). On IC we have no option to do so.

Well one proposal should be able to remove any amount of canisters, so uploaded 1000 times does not necessarily mean 1000 different proposals.

How does it not mean 1000 different proposals?
Either you always need a proposal to remove a canister or canisters can be removed without NNS deliberation. We are assuming that people reupload the same content after a proposal has been approved to remove that content, it's supposed to illustrate the futility of content moderation at the protocol level as opposed to the application level, where arbitrariness is allowed.

The miners in practice quite clearly don't have the power. If they try to go it alone against the wider network (users, non-mining nodes, businesses built on top of the network), nobody will follow them. They tried to increase the block size in 2016 and failed. Also in POS if validators collude to censor, a hard fork will result in their stake being lost. They have even less power than miners. 

The NNS is only one part of The IC community. It's only token holders. The community is users, node operators, businesses built around The IC and much more. Among the token holders, the richer ones have most power. The NNS deciding is merely the powerful deciding. It's recreating what already exists.

Yeah this is one of the things I like the least about IC, rich people not only have more power cause they have more tokens, but it also increases gradually thanks to staking rewards and neuron maturity, that means if you have money now and invest big time in 10 years nobody will be able to catch up.

I agree, right now we can not make a backup of canister (correct me if I'm wrong). So if it is deleted than all data is gone.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-14 11:50:37 UTC | #66

Not really, if you mined 10 years ago you just have more money than you did assuming you kept most of it, you dont have more power than others on the network, so lets say you've became a millionaire by mining BTC 10 years ago and I'm a millionaire by other means, if we both decided to reinvest in mining equipment to have power on the network we'd both have the same, regardless on your 10 year head start. With ICP not only the one who started 10 years ago has a huge advantage cause he bought more tokens for less and has earned staking rewards, he also has gained maturity on the neuron, so for me to catch up with him I'd have to spend 10 maybe 100 times more. So the rich get richer and gain more power.

faraz | 2021-12-14 12:00:08 UTC | #67


The trick being proposed here is that all boundary nodes resolved by special ic1.app domain be run in jurisdictions where DMCA doesn't apply.
 
There are 7 countries that don't honor DMCA  one can simply run a subnet and ic1.app boundary nodes there. Also one can simply run existing boundary nodes in such DMCA-free jurisdictions.  



This proposal at best "moves" the problem from node providers to boundary nodes. Don't think provides much on censorship resistance. If a censorship resistance trick to evade DMCA existed why wouldn't we apply it on the ic0.app domain itself?


Also, DMCA can be invoked against any OSP in the chain that delivers the contents.  So if I were Nintendo, and my copyrighted content is still accessible via ic1.app it will first go after ic1.app boundary nodes failing which I will go after node providers. 


> non-legally-compliant node, but may still be possible.

 the nodes would expect ICP rewards so they will technically go via a KYC. With KYC there is no room for being non-legally-compliant

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-14 12:41:45 UTC | #68

Honestly there isn't much to consider here as I see it.
What is the alternative route to what is being proposed?

Yes the team is amazing and the technology is unparalleled, an unparalleled piece of technology that will be left behind without hesitation if a path to decentralization and coherence with crypto ethos and industry standards that have already been set (IPFS, Arweave, Holochain) doesn't begin at this early stage. 
Should be easy to see how that's the case by observing the narrative that is being used to very effectively kill interest in the project: centralization, the kind that it isn't clear dfinity wants to get rid of.

I'd rather not get philosophical but the kind of concern being brought about by relevant people beg of it:
New technology has always and will always bring with it new ways to commit crimes and do bad. I wish it didn't, but it does. If it didn't then there was simply nothing new about it.
Law enforcement is to evolve and develop new ways to approach this AROUND the technology, NOT WITHIN it. It's a dialectic that can not be stopped and the kind of "lack" that one area produces in the others is what fuels the others to progress further.

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-14 12:09:30 UTC | #69

I don’t think it’s fair to say that the NNS is somehow more susceptible to the influence of rich people than any other blockchain be it PoW or PoS. As someone who has looked at them all, being a newcomer, they all seem to put control into the hands of who can afford the most hardware or buy the most tokens. The thing that was most appealing to me about the NNS is the liquid democracy and the ability to gain power through followers and the fact that long term commitments were rewarded with more voting power.

Not suggesting we can’t improve upon it. But I’m definitely not in favor of removing governance all together

Not sure if it can be done, but if this system is implemented then the end user should only be able to know which boundary node is serving the content and not the node where the content is actually hosted on.

[/quote]

Sorry for being wildly off-topic here, just to prove my point:
If I put 1 million usd into BTC mining 10 years ago (electricity out of pocket), no way you will ever mine the amount of BTC I have accumulated in the last 10 years putting in 1 million now. Same is true for my basement mined ETH that I'm able to stake now.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-14 12:34:52 UTC | #72

True but on BTC network the amount of BTC you own doesnt matter for consensus, hash rate does. Mining is also different than buying tokens from investor rounds, 1 million in mining equipment 10 years ago would have been outdated after a couple years, so you had to constantly invest new money if you wanted to keep up with others.

My point is miners always have to upgrade their infrastructure and pay bills if they want to keep their voting power, so while a head start gives you an advantage if I invest to own as much HW as another pool I get the same power as they have, with ICP early investors already have huge advantage cause of lower entry price + rewards but on top of that there is also neuron maturity, so a 1k fresh neuron has less power than one thats 8 years old.

northman | 2021-12-14 13:04:48 UTC | #73

If the boundary operator retains no content on their site and they were to take action, would it not undermine the position of being just a "telecom carrier" vs being a content moderator?  I agree, the proposal will provide the boundary operator with a mechanism to comply with an IP infringement request.

The effect of filtering at the boundary node will yield no relief for the IP owner as their content will be as accessible due to the resilient nature of the ICP architecture.  I expect lawyers of unhappy clients to quickly learn that taking down a boundary node is insufficient and then immediately take aim at the node operators and/or the data centre operators.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-14 13:19:15 UTC | #74

I fear giving the nodes the power to censor would actually make them way too powerful/vulnerable. Unless they are everywhere.
How to separate the protocol from the application layer on the IC? 

@harrison makes most sense imo. 

Gateways with some kind of terms of use agreement? But then again who's the judge?

Ideally the canister owner should be liable for the content, nobody else. 
But in law usually things aren't quite clear cut, specially on issues that haven't been argued before on some higher judicial level. So till there is some ruling taking the nodes out of the line of fire they'll likely keep getting notices.

Medium term, and given the alternative is either:

1. Do nothing.
2. Start Invoking NNS Deletes.

*I think this is our most viable option, especially when coupled with something like canister shuffling.* The larger blockchain community is already very hesitant towards to IC; most days I worry the perception of the IC is eroding more quickly than we are building it up. If we start NNS deleting these things out of the gate I worry the reputation of the IC will be destroyed. 

It is worth calling out we can enact this now and in the future remove it, if / when we come up with a better solution. **These are as much tools as solutions, and we can pick and choose what tool to use, when we use it, and how long we use it.** As with any tool, it commands respect, and its important to make sure you're choosing the right tool for the job.

In my own personal belief framework there is a lot of content that I believe the IC shouldn't host. However, I recognize my system isn't Harrisons framework or anyone else's for that matter. What should and should not end up on the IC is a hard topic to tackle. 

Yes, there are some items I know we'll all agree on. Even still I argue it isn't that simple. For example In the event someone uploads a "snuff film", are we to expect every neuron voter will go watch this video and attempt to figure out if is was actually a real murder? Some will I'm sure, but is isn't realistic. Now, do this thought experiment with CP.... **With the current voting structure even the delete path isn't sustainable** and frankly could be psychologically damaging long term (*this last part is my opinion*)*.

Still have more to say here, but will follow up in another post.

Alixthe | 2021-12-14 14:39:28 UTC | #77

Firstly, thanks for being at the forefront of all critical discussions on the IC @lastmjs ~ appreciate it!

Now for my silly question ~ in one of @Arthur's recent [podcasts](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1790339/9563559) (26min 25secs onwards), both Matt Grogan (OpenChat) and Arthur discussed about the Boundary Nodes being "*a dirty little secret of the Internet Computer*" which is run and controlled by the Dfinity Foundation (for now at least).  This was also clarified by a Dfinity team member in a Reddit post 2 months ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/q0axi2/comment/hfcswsj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

In addition, given these boundary nodes have information on location of canisters as noted in Arthur's podcast with Manu & Diego [here](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1790339/9616546-what-does-it-mean-to-be-web-speed-with-manu-diego?t=0) (15min 30 secs onwards), I guess any DMCA requests will be directed to the Dfinity Foundation unless it has a clear plan to open up the Boundary Nodes to the general public (if not already done so) in the near future.

From my understanding of @diegop's recent ['Long Term R&D: Boundary Nodes' post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-boundary-nodes-proposal/9401/11), it appears that the decentralisation of Boundary Nodes appears to be more of a long term plan:

> *It is proposed to enhance the design and implementation of the boundary nodes in several aspects, to make their deployment and operation more decentralized, make them easier to deploy and upgrade, and increase their security.*
>
> *Their scope is years, not weeks or months as in previous NNS motions*

Unless Boundary Nodes are open to the general public soon, Dfinity Foundation themselves will be the sole entity responsible for censoring canisters against which Dfinity Foundation will be an easy target for DMCA requests for some time.

I also understand from the [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity/comments/q0axi2/comment/hff92o8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) noted above that there will be a roadmap for the Dfinity Foundation to open up the Boundary Nodes to others however, have not seen any further information about this apart from Diego's Long Term R&D post (noted above).

So going forward, for 'Boundary Nodes as Censors' to be effective (and not be the sole responsibility of the Dfinity Foundation), we will need to find out if and when the Boundary Nodes will be open to the general public to host (instead of being run and owned by Dfinity unless this has already occurred without our knowledge).  

Please correct me if I am completely wrong and/or missing the point here.

Thanks.

northman | 2021-12-14 15:17:17 UTC | #78

I would have expected more transparency around the control of the boundary nodes to be disclosed in the summary that unleashed this entire debate.  Not doing so breeds cynicism.  Thanks for this post.

FGhostwriting | 2021-12-14 16:24:13 UTC | #80

I have a general question on boundary nodes...

Does this mean that the content would always still be on the Internet Computer but just that the boundary nodes would stop people from accessing it?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-14 16:44:24 UTC | #81

If all boundary were set to filter - it would be blocked from the front end.  If filtered by only a few of the nodes, the content would be available.  The content would still be on the canister and accessible by another canister.

[quote="Alixthe, post:77, topic:9640"]
it appears that the decentralisation of Boundary Nodes appears to be more of a long term plan:
[/quote]

Since you quoted my words, I thought I should clarify (clearly I left room for interpretation).


## Macro: (My intent)
The proposal that is meant for years is not the decentralization of boundary nodes…. It is the long term researching and implementation of boundary node related activities. Akin to “let’s build a team internally to handle all boundary node issues” or “let’s make this a thread from where projects are born from.”

For example, the scalability proposal is about all possible scalability issues. It is no single project. Some projects take days or weeks. Having that as a thread is a multi-year effort.

That was my intent.

## Micro: the boundary node folks intent

Folks like Yotam can explain more different blockers and timelines and levels of difficulty and priorities. Do not take my intent about building up “strong arms” for the foundation as me dictating or predicting their work. The boundary nodes folks are working on their 1-pager to explain what they are thinking, so I think some things may be clearer once that is out. 

I hope that helps explain what I intended. Sorry for confusion.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-14 17:49:38 UTC | #83

After giving it some thought I think the best way to solve this dilemma is to have 2 types of nodes: KYC/NNS approved and anonymous ones.

KYC nodes: 
- Work as they currently do (have to be approved by NNS, flat ICP rewards, etc...)
- Have to follow NNS imposed guidelines for both HW/network requirements and content hosted.
- Best for 90% use cases as they have lower costs and best performance.

Anonymous nodes: 
- Lower HW requirements (not necessarily a rasperberry, but a consumer grade workstation with an I7, 32GBs of RAM, etc..)
- Requires staked ICPs to run a node.
- Stake can be slashed.
- Rewards are paid based on amount of computation/bandwidth provided.
- It doesn't follow any guidelines, but boundary nodes providers can decide to blacklist specific canisters they don't want to serve.
- Only follows NNS when it comes to technical proposals.
- Slower and more expensive but more resilient to censorship.

What do you think?

-------------------------

FGhostwriting | 2021-12-14 17:50:44 UTC | #84

Thank you for your answer. That's what I thought. 

So part 2 of my question then would be...

What if someone posts legitimately illegal content? Would there be no way to remove it? Does it just get roped off into some type of "dark web" on the Internet Computer?

-------------------------

codi0 | 2021-12-14 18:56:34 UTC | #85

Great discussion to be having.

I'm not quite clear on the benefit of moving liability from a storage node (or the underlying data centre) to a boundary node. If anything, it seems like it could make the situation more murky. Those with grievances will surely quickly understand that a single boundary node blocking their content from being accessed doesn't solve their problem, and so will feel compelled to go after storage nodes / data centres / dfinity (whatever the best attack vector is).

I do agree with the principle of keeping the IC protocols censorship-resistant, and then building community-governed features on top that deal with these issues.

I keep coming back to the idea of filter-lists that nodes can subscribe to, that make the node compliant with certain governance rules automatically. This allows the majority of the community to create a "global" list with rules that deal with commonly agreed issues (and how to resolve them), as well as lists with more specific rules that might apply to certain sub-communities. It also allows for sub-communities who want to take on all the risk themselves and subscribe to no rules whatsoever (in which case, node and canister operators should be 100% liable).

An ICP dapp version of something like kleros.io could be created to deal with the submission of grievances, as well as the creation, management of and subscribing to filter-lists (including things like voting on new rules, amendments and giving permission to groups of people to administer rules on behalf of subscribers).

-------------------------

Deepsea | 2021-12-14 19:08:48 UTC | #86

Interesting concept, probably the best yet. It's a way of 'suspending' the canister from the public, without removing the original canister, in a decentralized way. I suppose you could say it is outsourcing moderation to external gatekeepers, but keeping that open so the power is not centralized. It still leaves many questions as to how a complaint could be effectively filed/verified/resolved and what to do with extreme situations, if the first line of defence is swiss cheese. Dealing with real issues by playing wackamole is not a great look. I kind of like what codi0 is talking about here ^ that could help.

Some artists are already upset with Opensea, I saw this tweet with 30k likes: https://twitter.com/loishh/status/1470340143970230277 and this person organizing action https://twitter.com/CirenSong/status/1468977858487934986 .. even if opensea deletes the NFTs, they are still out there, probably on IPFS. I feel this story will get worse for all chains, as the creators are exploited by grifters that reap all the rewards of the creators work. This narrative may not have gone mainstream yet, but it's a slow moving snowball going downhill gaining speed.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-15 02:31:40 UTC | #89

Presently, if someone were to post illegal content, the NNS has the ability to delete the canister with the offending material.  Doing so would require putting a proposal up for vote, and then receive adequate votes.  There are diverse views on the use of this capability expressed in this thread.  I am only answering narrowly to your question..

-------------------------

jonathondsmartin | 2021-12-15 08:08:12 UTC | #90

My 2 cents:

The challenge as I see it is this: in order to use the IC, people need to trust the IC. But in order to continue to exist and be useful, the IC must not allow illegal content to the extent that states start taking it down either by removing nodes or coercing node providers.

I don't believe this issue can be resolved with a clever hack. The IC may be in the world of bits, but we live in the world of people, and those people can break things and imprison people or make their lives otherwise unpleasant. If "someone" is making material unavailable - whether it be the NNS or boundary node operators, it needs to be perceived as just or there will be blowback.

The only solution is to devise a process that ensures the material removed from the IC is widely perceived as being respectful of the law. Clearly, the NNS voting on proposals does not meet this requirement. It is a subset of people with unequal power and no obvious competence to make such decisions. 

But there does need to be a process in the medium term. Fortunately, people have been working on decentralised justice for some time and as some people have already mentioned, Kleros already has a working model. In a nutshell, people pay to take a dispute to the court (e.g. Nintendo makes a copyright claim). The dispute is farmed out semi-randomly to the community, who pay to sit on the jury. They review the evidence and make a verdict. The big twist is that if they do not vote with the majority, they lose their money. This makes it costly for jurors to insert their own prejudices into their evaluation.

I see this as the only way to create a trustworthy system.

This is just not the reality.
I see people responding with far fetched hypotheticals as if this was a new problem no one had to face before, that's incorrect and it doesn't help. We don't need to call Socrates to discuss, as other web3 protocols have already resolved the issue and have been adopted successfully by the community (IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave).

jonathondsmartin | 2021-12-15 15:00:33 UTC | #94

But this does nothing to protect the node providers. If the regulatory authorities go after them the IC has a problem in that region.

-------------------------

jonathondsmartin | 2021-12-15 15:09:18 UTC | #95

I'm okay with a wait and see approach but I also think the IC needs to have a backup plan if states start to go after it. The IC is not just a protocol, it can store all kinds of stuff, and it will attract negative attention if it starts to violate laws on a large enough scale. Imagine a decentralised Youtube with no way to remove the violating material. I find it hard to believe there would be no pushback.

-------------------------

NickM | 2021-12-15 16:18:51 UTC | #96

Here's the link @harrison provided to IPFS's legal pages https://ipfs.io/legal/ 

IMO it is an enlightening read.

Edit: the IPFS approached is based upon the following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act

Also, enlightening. Specifically, " The DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of Internet service providers and other intermediaries..."

This is interesting but it leaves me with three questions:

3. What happens if the issue is not copyright infringement but other kinds of illegality like child porn?

From my perspective (more than 5 years working as a senior leader in state education with responsibility for safeguarding vulnerable children and families - some of it really nasty stuff) the problem is that too few people realise the solution we are looking for is a framework for resolving issues, not an answer to every imaginable issue.

TBH, it would look a lot like the IPFS approach, ie a system for reporting issues that declares an intention to resolve the issues by implementing a tried and tested legal framework.

The main problem is that real life is plain old messy. Dealing with it requires a complex decision tree; if A, consider B, if B consider C, if not C, consider D.This is what Laws provide. I understand that other participants on these threads have issues with the sources of Laws. It is not my intention to suggest one over the other because of a cultural, or ethnic leaning, but because the creation of a brand new framework will take years as it wont be recognised in any jurisdiction and will therefore be costly proving it is fit for purpose time and time again in legal challenges across the globe. 

It is, of course, vital to point out that no system is perfect, so the choice becomes does one use a Nation State's legal framework, or (my preference) a document from the United Nations, which will suggest an ideal towards which all Nation States should aspire. This would seem as reasonable an approach as is possible for counteracting the activity of rogue, or authoritarian states. 

The UN is working on the inclusion of free access to the internet as a Human Right (https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/un-declares-online-freedom-to-be-a-human-right-that-must-be-protected-a7120186.html). As an example, the child safeguarding framework I used was derived from National Law by Counties, but the fundamental principles we worked with were taken from the UN Children's Charter, which states "The Rights of the Child are Paramount". 

IMO, Dfinity needs to clearly define the role of different node provider types using language existing systems recognise. As a consequence of this definition it should become clear that node providers enjoy at least the same level of protection afforded to existing internet infrastructure providers. Most importantly, this should then enable the most vulnerable members of our global society, e.g. slaves, to 
know that if their plight comes to light on the internet, or internet computer, there is a reasonable chance society will be able to act in their best interest.

This is at the heart of my personal politics and approach to daily living, society must be able to protect the most vulnerable. 

I think I have gone off the reservation a bit here, but hope the answer you are looking for is apparent.

Hear, hear! A path to resolution like IPFS is needed IMO as well
