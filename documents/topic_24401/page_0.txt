Preparations are underway for the launch of **[Querio](https://querio.io/)**’s SNS DAO, with the decentralization sale set to begin soon.

Querio stands as the first Web3 search engine that enables seamless discovery of dApps across multiple blockchains. The list of supported blockchains is continuously growing, currently highlighting Internet Computer, Ethereum, Stellar, NEAR Protocol, and BNB Chain.

Built on the Internet Computer, the search engine and front-end are running on-chain, providing robust data security and integrity.

At the heart of Querio's vision is the creation of a decentralized search engine that facilitates easy navigation within the Web3 ecosystem. Our roadmap details ambitious plans to further achieve this vision.

For a better understanding of Querio's approach, including the QRO token's utility, allocation, treasury, tokenomics and roadmap, reviewing the [proposal summay](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-sns/blob/main/sns_proposal_summary.md), [whitepaper](https://querio.notion.site/querio/Querio-Whitepaper-093dca931e374657a5ae7c42a8f9da16) and [press release](https://news.bitcoin.com/querio-the-daring-upstart-on-a-mission-to-revolutionize-decentralized-search/) is highly recommended, as they could provide answers to many potential questions.

Please note that our whitepaper may be subject to minor revisions depending on the number of QRO tokens sold during our current [presale](https://presale.querio.io/).

I have not tried Querio in a while and was excited.

Today I did this: searched 'dfinity' in querio.io.  The top result is 'taste it' 🤷‍♂️. 
https://mm7g2-iyaaa-aaaad-qaapq-cai.raw.ic0.app/

2. Also where is the code? 
SNS need to be open-sourced so we can check that it does what you say it does.

Thanks!

andreea | 2023-11-03 18:44:25 UTC | #3

Thank you for trying out Querio! 

We're actively refining our search algorithms, and once the 'Sort by popularity, newest, and recently updated' feature will be released, you can expect significantly enhanced ranking.

As for the open-source aspect, we're committed to transparency. The Querio frontend, ICP bot (crawler), and the search engine code will be made publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/) soon, as outlined in our [proposal summary](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-sns/blob/main/sns_proposal_summary.md).

What differentiates you from Kinic?

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-03 20:38:19 UTC | #6

The differences are also part of the Querio whitepaper:

* **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Starting with Internet Computer, Ethereum, Stellar, NEAR Protocol and BNB Chain, Querio offers the flexibility to explore decentralized applications across a diverse range of blockchain networks.
* **Multi-Word Searches**: Allows users to enter multiple words for more precise and relevant results.
* **User-Friendly Design**: With dApp logos alongside results, autocomplete suggestions and summarized content snippets.
* **Transparency**: Displays the number of search results returned and the duration of each search.
* **Accessibility**: Adapts the presentation of search results to fit the device in use, employing pagination for clarity on laptops and desktops, while offering a continuous scroll on mobile devices and tablets for uninterrupted browsing.
* **Smart Ranking Algorithm**: The search engine leverages a proprietary ranking algorithm optimized to surface the most relevant results, improving the overall search experience.
* **Extensive Search Coverage**: Delivers an extensive number of search results at near-instantaneous speeds, making it easy to witness its efficiency

**[Here](https://youtu.be/r_fc-sSQXLc)** you can observe the search results returned by Querio when searching for dApps built on ICP.

**[Here](https://youtu.be/K61yoMmHrzo)** you can observe the speed at which Querio operates.

let4be | 2023-11-03 21:18:52 UTC | #7

I can add to this list: querio is WAY faster and has less bugs, at least from my experience

* Can you explain what is unique about your tech stack or your solution? I see you index other blockchain apps but why is this better than me using google?
* What makes this project worth funding?
* Who are the founders and what about them makes them suited to lead a project like this?
* I see you also have a presale going on and have raised 38K ICP so far. Why is that not enough to validate your idea?

> * Can you explain what is unique about your tech stack or your solution? I see you index other blockchain apps but why is this better than me using google?

Sure, I can explain without repeating what is already outlined in our whitepaper.

Web2 search engines dominate the data landscape often lacking transparency.
Querio on the other hand is a decentralized search engine that operates on-chain and will soon be open-source. You can validate how its ranking algorithm functions, ensuring results aren't influenced by a company's policies.

Plus, transparency and user-privacy are of utmost importance to us. Unlike big corporations that capture user data for targeted ads, we don't store any user data or search preferences. Is more about giving control to the people than following the agenda of a few stakeholders.

Another difference is that Querio is focused on Web3. On Querio you can discover new dApps and also choose to search dApps on a specific blockchain ecosystem. You cannot do that with any other search engine.

> * What makes this project worth funding?

With the features we're going to implement, we have a robust plan that lays the foundation for a business ready to become a decentralized alternative to established tech search giants. These are:

* **Querio Drive** to easily store data, leveraging the Internet Computer's infrastructure. This will be a paid service, providing a secure and efficient method for storing and sharing data through Internet Identity.
* **Promoting dApps** to promote dApps that closely match the queried keywords. Marked as “Featured,” these promoted dApps gain will appear prominently among the top search results, for a fee.
* **Featured dApps auction** to secure a spot in the featured dApps section on the home page. Users can bid for prominent placement in the featured dApps area, thereby gaining enhanced visibility for their chosen dApps through this paid feature.
* **Web3 AI** and **Code AI** to answer dApps and Web3 code-related questions. These AI-powered services will be accessible through a paid subscription model.
* **Querio Shopping** to buy and sell NFTs. This enables seamless and secure transactions, facilitating the vibrant marketplace for digital collectibles and unique assets. Our revenue model will be based on transaction fees.

And please note that we know what we're doing, have the experience to back it up, understand the pressure, and recognize that our investors and community have high expectations, which we are committed to meeting to the best of our ability.

> * Who are the founders and what about them makes them suited to lead a project like this?

Me and George are the founders, both have 16+ years of software development experience in Romania and the Netherlands, in small and big companies.

We began our blockchain journey in 2017 while working at ConsenSys and subsequently established CrossChain Labs. Along the way, together with Catalin and Cristina, started collaborating with prominent partners such as NEAR Protocols, Stellar, Dfinity, Fantom Foundation, Polkadot and Filecoin.

[**Here**](https://www.crosschainlabs.tech/meet-the-team) you can find more details about ourselves, and by clicking on 'Profile’, you can view our LinkedIn profiles.

> * I see you also have a presale going on and have raised 38K ICP so far. Why is that not enough to validate your idea?

We want to dedicate ourselves to developing Querio as a long-term project with substantial scope, rather than a short-term project dependent on continuous fundraising. Securing sufficient funds now would allow us to focus fully on enhancing Querio's capabilities.

We started this project with personal investments fueled by our passion and vision. However, substantial, sustained development to achieve our long-term goals for Querio need a more significant financial foundation.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-04 11:47:08 UTC | #14

> Are you guys on presale?

Yes, our presale is currently open and will end on Monday. We've implemented several rules and limitations to ensure the integrity of the process, which may have been a bit overwhelming to investors. Howerver, having 116 participants trust us is a significant achievement that we’re proud of. 

We’re thankful to our remarkable community for their support!

Thank you! The 2% will be airdropped to our early supporters and Funded NFT holders as mentioned in our [proposal summary](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-sns/blob/main/sns_proposal_summary.md).

Thank you for your full on explanation.  I will invest through your SNS dao sale when it starts.

-------------------------

opvm | 2023-11-06 15:21:53 UTC | #17

I am still very confused about this. IN your white paper it never says a date for when people can review your code.

Developers need to be able to review the SNS code. What specific date do you plan on letting people start this?

I will not invest, and I do not think anyone should invest, until the code is has had time to be reviewed.

*EDIT: also your pre-sale, where is the code for that? Are people just blindly trusting it does what you say it does?

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-06 19:47:06 UTC | #18

Thank you for bringing up your concerns.

The whitepaper doesn’t mention a specific date since it's not a usual requirement, but for clarity, we are targeting the end of next week to open source our code.

Querio frontend, search engine, ICP bot (crawler), scraper and content miner components will be made publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/).

Regarding the presale, its canisters operates independently and will not be part of the SNS.

Hi @andreea,

I just wanted to make you aware, that the activation of matched funding is currently up for vote: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-updates-nov-10-2023-matched-funding-for-sns-swaps-stable-memory-migration-for-nns-neurons/24578

This changes the mechanics of how the Neuron Fund will participate if a project requests participation from the Neuron Fund. You can read more about it here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/suggested-enhancements-to-the-community-fund/20411/7.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-13 10:14:19 UTC | #21

Hi @domwoe, 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We appreciate the latest developments in the Neurons' Fund participation mechanism and will align the Querio SNS configuration with these enhancements.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-15 17:33:57 UTC | #22

Querio is pleased to announce the [open-sourcing](https://github.com/orgs/QuerioDAO/repositories) of the following components:

* [Querio Frontend]()
* [Search Engine]()
* [ICP Bot (Crawler)]()
* [Content Miner]()

Additionally, the **Scraper** and **Publisher** repos will be open-sourced later this week. For an overview of how these elements integrate, please refer to our [high-level architecture](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/91743348/283193296-00bccaf5-aa6c-48be-bfd6-4ff650c32fc3.png).

At this stage, we are not open-sourcing our multi-chain code, focusing on the ICP version for the SNS. Our frontend will feature two distinct tabs for ICP and multi-chain indexes, each powered by the same search engine code.

As part of Querio Roadmap detailed in the Whitepaper (Section 7), we plan to on-board community content miners into our network by Q3 2024, aligning with the open-sourcing of our multi-chain code to encourage community collaboration.

However, after Querio transitions to a DAO, the multi-chain code can be earlier open-sourced through a DAO motion. This decision should be carefully considered to ensure it aligns with Querio's development and long-term goals, while maintaining our status as the leading Web3 search engine enabling multi-chain dApp discovery.

We have also updated our whitepaper and [SNS config spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WgoS1mDJGGSkw5u6zOIhlHmDH7FOrRFTVJLi98hWEJQ/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect the latest SNS enhancements and presale token distribution.

Thanks @borovan for highlighting this! 

While both logos are square, they feature distinct designs, color distributions, and elements, including the pixelation effect on Querio's logo.

Recently, we had a discussion with Silvia from Origyn about the logo similarity, particularly regarding the potential confusion it might create on CoinMarketCap

Therefore, we've requested an official opinion from CoinMarketCap and will provide an update as soon as we receive their feedback.

Additionally, a DAO motion will be initiated post-SNS to further debate on this topic.

We are excited to follow up on our recent post: Querio has now [open-sourced](https://github.com/orgs/QuerioDAO/repositories) the following components:

* [Scraper](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/content-scraper)
* [Publisher](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/publisher)

Hi Querio team,

Thanks a lot for participating in the SNS office hours this week!

As promised I would like to get back to you with some follow-up answers.

**Question 1: How to create a neuron with dfx (that can then be used on CLI to submit the NNS proposal to get an SNS)?**

There is actually one easy solution that was mentioned by an NNS engineer and that I missed during the office hours: you can stake a neuron in any way, for example using the [NNS frontend dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/) and then just add your dfx principal as a hot key to the neuron. Since a hot key has the permissions to submit a proposal in the name of the neuron, the dfx principal should then be able to do this. You can find the dfx command to do so [here in the developer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/launching/launch-steps-1proposal#3-submit-nns-proposal-to-create-sns).

**Question 2: What is the limit on the sns init file and is there a reliable way to test this locally? / Is there a message limit that could be hit if there are a lot of initial neurons?**

* The actual limits are a bit hard to evaluate for two reasons:
  * 1) the content of the init file is converted to different formats and sent in messages together with additional information.
  * 2) the content of the init file is sent over different message channels with different limits.

* In detail, in the proposal's submission is an ingress message with limit *3.5MB*, where the content of the init file is sent together with other information defining the proposal. If an NNS proposal to create an SNS is adopted, the NNS governance canister asks the SNS-W canister to create the SNS canisters. This is an inter-canister call on the same subnet with a current limit of *10MB*. This message not only has the content of the init file, but in addition information about the neurons’ fund which requires additional space. Finally, the SNS-W creates the SNS governance canister with the initial neurons. This is a cross-net message with the limit [*2MB*](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/resource-limits). This message contains, in addition to the init file information, the WASM of the SNS governance canister.
In general the *3.5MB* and *10MB* were intermediate measures to allow for WASM installations, but there might be better solutions for this going forward which will allow decreasing these values again. So ideally one should assume a *2MB* limit everywhere in the longer term.

* Currently, there is no limit enforced on the NNS governance on the size of the contents of the init file, including the number of initial neurons. We acknowledge that this is not ideal and suggest adding a limit on the number of initial neurons that is on the more conservative side (with the goal that if the proposal can be made, then with high likelihood no limits would be hit later in the process).

* What can you do next?
  * You could try to decrease the number of initial neurons, e.g., by giving fewer neurons to the principals.
  * You could try to estimate the size of the different messages and whether you would be close to the theoretical limits. If you go ahead with the proposal and one of the steps still hits the message limit, the SNS launch would fail and the dapp’s control would be given back to the registered principals. You could then try again.
  * You could build a custom canister that will be given under SNS control, which owns a few initial neurons and can later distribute neurons by splitting them into more neurons. One thing to be careful about here: this would mean that right at the time when the SNS is launched, these initial neurons are not yet in the hands of their final owners. This shifts the voting power distribution right after launch and therefore could be a risk.

We hope this is helpful and are happy to try to help if you should have any additional questions. 
Happy weekend!

Hi @lara,

Thank you for your detailed answer. We are glad to see that our SNS init file is around 190KB, well within the 2MB threshold.

However, we are currently encountering an issue. When using the new parameter “**neurons_fund_participation**,” we receive the following error:

`Invalid configuration in 'sns_init.yaml': Unable to convert the configuration file to a proposal:` 
`Failed to convert CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal to SnsInitPayload:` 
`Error: neurons_fund_participation must not be specified until Matched Funding is enabled.`

Here are more details:
* We installed the sns-cli from this location: https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/d73659a2baf78302b88e29e5c2bc891cde1e3e0b/openssl-static-binaries/x86_64-darwin/sns.gz.
* Running ./sns -V gives the following output: sns-cli 1.0.0.
* Our sns_init file is available here: https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-sns/blob/main/sns/sns_init.yaml.

Looking forward to your guidance on this.

-------------------------

aterga | 2023-11-21 13:29:18 UTC | #30

It seems that the [latest version](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-sns/blob/726fdbb543510c2cc1aa6d4f043d1954f9e6bc69/sns/sns_init.yaml) of your sns_init.yaml file causes a different issue, namely, I was getting the following output from `./sns init-config-file validate`:

```
Invalid configuration in "sns_init.yaml": Unable to convert configuration file to proposal: Error: The following PrincipalIds have a dissolve_delay_seconds configured greater than the allowed max_dissolve_delay_seconds (31557600): [...]
```

This is because `Voting.MaximumVotingPowerBonuses.DissolveDelay.duration` was set to `1 year`, while some of the neurons specified in the same file had a dissolve beyond 1 year.

This is however an orthogonal issue to the original one you've asked about. The error `neurons_fund_participation must not be specified until Matched Funding is enabled` indicates that the version of `sns` is too old. Please try to always use the version specified in the sns-testing repo's main branch: https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing/blob/main/settings.sh#L29C19-L29C59

So for your current work, please download the `sns` CLI tool from [here](https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/751b2a0cf904934b4afb62b1457f6bf4f0a20275/openssl-static-binaries/x86_64-darwin/sns.gz).

domwoe | 2023-11-21 13:41:19 UTC | #31

Hi @andreea,

We've released a new version of the SNS Tokenomics Analyzer which supports matched funding and the latest version of the SNS init config file. The Tokenomics Google Sheet won't be updated to support matched funding and can be considered deprecated.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-tokenomics-analyzer/22954/4

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-22 07:03:45 UTC | #32

Thank you @aterga for the insightful feedback and guidance on resolving the issue. We have followed your advice and are now using the SNS CLI tool from the recommended source.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-23 06:43:54 UTC | #33

Thanks for the update @domwoe! We're now using the new version of the SNS Tokenomics Analyzer. Appreciate the heads up about the Google Sheet deprecation.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-11-23 09:46:27 UTC | #34

Great!

I've got a couple more questions :slight_smile: 

Are you using a tool like [UserGeek](https://fbbjb-oyaaa-aaaah-qaojq-cai.raw.ic0.app/) to be able to provide some usage metrics of Querio?

Furthermore, do you have instructions for the community to create reproducible builds?  Otherwise, the community wouldn't be able to verify proposals that upgrade your application.

-------------------------

lara | 2023-11-23 10:03:40 UTC | #35

>Thank you for your detailed answer. We are glad to see that our SNS init file is around 190KB, well within the 2MB threshold.

Note that this alone might not be a guarantee that it will work. One concrete example: when the SNS is created by SNS-W, then there is a message from SNS-W to the SNS subnet, with a limit of 2MB, that does not directly include the init file, but rather some of the information from the init file (the information about all initial neurons) and *in addition* the Wasm of the SNS governance. 
So to have a good estimate, you would have to guess how much space all this information takes up, in the format that it has at the time of the message (which is not the init file format anymore)

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-23 10:21:03 UTC | #36

@domwoe, regarding analytics, we initially used Google Analytics but, considering community concerns about using a Google tool, we've decided to remove it. We're now in the process of transitioning to a decentralized alternative like UserGeek, which we plan to implement soon (a couple of days).

As for reproducible builds, bellow are the links providing details on the environment that should be used:

* [Querio Reproducible Builds](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio/blob/main/README.md#reproducible-builds)
* [Querio SE Reproducible Builds](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-se/blob/main/README.md#reproducible-builds)

These resources should help the community in verifying proposals that upgrade Querio.

-------------------------

domwoe | 2023-11-23 10:31:36 UTC | #37

It's hard for people to replicate this environment. A better approach is to provide a reproducible environment with a docker file or similar. 

You can check the docs for more information: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/reproducible-builds or look at examples like [OpenChat](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat#deterministic-builds).

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-23 10:32:57 UTC | #38

Hi @lara,

Thank you for pointing this out. As we've already initiated the proposal, we're closely monitoring the process and are aware that dApp’s control would be given back to the registered principals, in case any message limit is encountered at the SNS launch. Hopefully all will go as expected.

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-23 11:09:13 UTC | #39

We're excited to share that we've made significant progress towards decentralization with the creation of a proposal for the launch of the Querio SNS. 

Your ongoing support is greatly appreciated in this journey!

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126081

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-24 14:00:46 UTC | #40

Great suggestion @domwoe. We've now included instructions for reproducing builds with Docker, making the process more accessible:

* [Querio Reproducible Builds using Docker](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio/blob/main/README.md#reproducible-builds-using-docker)
* [Querio SE Reproducible Builds using Docker](https://github.com/QuerioDAO/querio-se/blob/main/README.md#reproducible-builds-using-docker)

jennifertran | 2023-11-28 20:56:32 UTC | #41

Do you have an idea on when you will submit your proposal?

-------------------------

andreea | 2023-11-28 21:33:36 UTC | #42

Our [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126081) has already been successfully executed.

The Querio SNS decentralization sale is set to start in just 8 hours, and you can participate [here](https://nns.ic0.app/project/?project=s4vxj-faaaa-aaaaq-aabza-cai).
