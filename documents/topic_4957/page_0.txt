I'm trying to deploy a canister to the IC and getting the following errors:

- Can't create a new IC identity. I.e. when I run:

> dfx identity --network ic get-wallet or dfx deploy --network ic

It returns:
```
Creating a wallet canister on the ic network.
The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 404 Not Found, content type "text/html", content: <html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>

</html>
```

I've tried both:
- dfx v0.7.0-beta-6 
- dfx v0.7.1

This is expected, the general app subnets will be available soon and you'll be able to deploy your canisters.

Ok so you currently need permission to deploy canisters to mainnet or something?
