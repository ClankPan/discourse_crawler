# Proposal for NP Self-declaration

**The problem**

A secure and sustainable operation of the IC requires (1) maximal decentralization and (2) that Node Providers (NPs), who own and operate the network’s nodes, behave in the interest of the network.

What does maximal decentralization mean? It means maximizing the number of the independent NPs and diversifying the geographies, jurisdictions, and datacenters (DCs) where the nodes are operated.

In a fully decentralized network, onboarding of a Node Provider (NP) is managed entirely by the Network Nervous Systems (NNS). This means that anybody who wants to become a NP needs to submit a proposal that will be voted upon by the community. The main question then is: how to decide whether to accept or reject a new NP into the network? That's where we would like to have your feedback on as community.

**The goal - assessment of a new NP by the community**

We propose to take a three level approach that will help the community to assess whether a new NP should be onboarded:

1. Automatically validate part of the technical configuration of the NP during onboarding.
2. Financial stake by the NP through investment in node hardware.
3. Self-declaration of identity and good intent.

First, there are a lot of items that can be validated automatically during the onboarding of a NP, in particular the configuration setup and location of the NP. These can be included as part of the autonomous onboarding process that we are currently working on (see blog post [Node Decentralization Status](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/120?u=svenf)).

Second, new NP will have a substantial stake in the IC through the investment in HW Infrastructure for running their nodes. As described by Dom in his recent article ([Blogpost Dom](https://medium.com/dfinity/lets-grow-the-internet-computer-network-why-and-how-and-general-updates-1c8d0770a299)), NPs are not required to stake ICP, but the HW investment ensures that the NP has sufficient incentive to ensure to run nodes efficiently and reliably. This level of NP assessment has already been implemented through the current NP reward system, and will be refined in the future. To learn about this, please refer to the Forum post update on Node Decentralization (see [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/128?u=svenf)).

A financial stake as described above might not be enough to dissuade malicious node providers from colluding to break a subnet. Therefore, as a third level of assessment, we propose to the community that NPs are asked to present a self-declaration when requesting the NNS to be added to the network. In this, NPs:

* state their identity and business entity;
* accept that they are liable for the financial damage and harm caused in case they maliciously collude with other node providers to subvert the functioning of the network;
* accept that they understand that deliberately subverting the protocol, by modifying code, colluding with other malicious node providers, or otherwise, constitutes the misuse of a computer system.

We believe that a self-declaration will greatly increase security to the benefits of all stakeholders in the IC network, ranging from NPs to developers and entrepreneurs building on the network.

**The way forward**

With this forum post, we present a proposal of a self-declaration template (see draft on the IC wiki: [Node Provider Self-declaration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Self-declaration)) and invite the community to give feedback. What does the community want to see and know from a NP before an informed decision can be made as to whether to accept or reject the NP into the network?

Once we have collected sufficient feedback and adapted our proposal accordingly, we plan to submit a motion proposal with the intention to turn the self-declaration into a community-approved procedure. Should this motion proposal be accepted, the community is encouraged to reject any NP application not complying with the template or not providing credible data as requested by the template.

We are very much looking forward to your feedback!

That looks good! 

I think we need something that ties the self declaration to the node provider key, otherwise the same self declaration could be submitted for multiple node providers, and voters can't really tell which one is the "real" one.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-11-11 16:52:22 UTC | #3

In a DC, along with NPs, is it also important to decentralize nodes based on the ISP they use to connect to the internet?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-11-11 17:24:25 UTC | #4

A couple questions:

1) What happens if a provider violates the self declaration? Is he sued? If so by who?

2) Is the declaration legally enforceable in all juridisdictions? If not does that mean NP in those areas won't be able to run a node?

3) How will the NNS verify the providers' legitimacy? What's stopping someone from using fake/stolen IDs to submit a NP request?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-11-12 19:17:56 UTC | #6

I kind of agree, but the whole premise of the IC is that it uses "deterministic decentralization" to carefully construct subnets using nodes in different jurisdictions and operated by different principals. That allows the IC to drastically reduce subnet sizes to achieve high performance without (theoretically) sacrificing security guarantees.

This is in stark contrast to blockchains like Ethereum, where decentralization is "non-deterministic" because anyone (even anonymous) can participate in consensus at any time.

I think the IC's model is more realistic about things, as you can't completely divorce the virtual world from the physical world (otherwise it leads to situations like >50% of Ethereum nodes running in centralized clouds). Not sure if this NP self-declaration is meant to be legally enforceable though.

I woudn't be so sure about that, deterministically identifying individuals is not an easy task, especially for a DAO. Imho if banks can be fooled by bad actors so can the NNS, NP doxing themselves also open up another kind of attack vector, cause now they can be bribed or blackmailed.

[quote="jzxchiang, post:6, topic:16501"]

I think that's a smaller issue than some make it out to be, staking pools having lots of VP and being OFAC compliant is a much bigger one. ETH like chains have a capitalistic approach to determine where nodes are hosted: the simplest and cheapest option becomes the meta, if tomorrow Google or AWS were to ban ETH nodes they'd just move elsewhere with minor disruptions to the network, on the other side if running IC nodes became illegal for whatever reason, the protocol would require significant changes to make it run in a different environment and that'd cause major disruptions.

They can be currently already be bribed and can advertise their participation if they wish to do so, so I’m not sure what the added risk is there. 

On the blackmail side a NP being blackmailed or targeted by a criminal organization or government is a serious risk. Imagine the NSA says that they need to break into 1/3 of the nodes on a subnet for reason X, or a specific node to retrieve canister data (very difficult, but the US government might be able to do this?).

It’s that much simpler if the nodes have already  doxed themselves.

On the other side, realistically I think the ship has sailed in terms of privacy from the node provider side given all of the recent developments and shady players that crypto seems to attract. Living in the US, I’d prefer to be able to hold nodes legally responsible, even if this risks that my government or other parties can more easily track them. 

I understand how this might be problematic in other nations, but if that’s the case then I don’t want nodes to be running in areas with rampant crime or that are at risk of becoming absorbed by a surveillance initiative.

If there’s too many nodes in subnet in a single country, then that’s a decentralization problem.

Thank you for spending time trying to improve the ICP and sharing your concerns.

Now I have few questions : 

Can someone tell me why this *third level of assessment* is doable or even useful ?
- People providing service as NP know they have to be in good faith or kicked out
- Identity is unverifiable
- Do you even know how much money/hardware is needed to do arm to the IC ?

Wouldnt it be smarter to start by checking if the incentives aren't already enough ?
Isnt there any risk by making this onboarding harder ?
Is it now the right time to think about it ?
Have you done a proper SWAT analysis ?
Would this move make it harder for people to onboard ?
As a NP do you want your identity to be available online ?
Is that not just another administrative constraint that come from the 19th century ?
Is this template even fillable in every countries ?

With love,

xx

Could the KYC Application process be leveraged here?

i) Create an Internet Identity (II)
ii) Submit II for KYC Identification - https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/5006142379284-How-do-I-submit-a-KYC-application-
iii) Node Provider application is tethered to KYC'd II.

IMO the meaning and benefits of transparency have yet to be understood by the broader crypto community.

Anonymous Node = hidden, opaque = compromises can occur and persist without Network knowing
Known Node = open, transparent = compromises are known enabling Network action

Network Resilience is created through the distribution of nodes across multiple jurisdictions.

Key Question: could Node Operators be free to state and select which Subnets they host in order to PREVENT exposure to legal liability within their geographical jurisdiction, which would in turn enable developers to deploy dApps on Subnets within favourable legal jurisdictions? And to be explicit... if a dApp is considered illegal by EVERY JURISDICTION IN THE WORLD the Node Providers and End User MUST be made aware of this.... and to be explicit:

No, DYOR is not an appropriate answer. It's a copout/fallacy/obfuscation bad actors/scammers effectively deploy in the pursuit of self-interest/greed/incompetence. 

IF a globally illegal dApp is considered morally/culturally acceptable by us (the people), we (the people) need to know about it! It should be discussed on a transparent crypto powered platform, not tucked away in the corner of an opaque network governments can claim is tainted, disreputable and dishonest.

But wouldn't that mean the IC is no longer a sovereign network ruled by the NNS, but a network running on the goodwill of the governments of countries were DCs are located? That'd be a big paradigm shift and should be publicly advertised.
If NNS governance becomes a facade cause voting against a governments' will results in hundreds of nodes going down then the IC is much less of a blockchain as most intend and more of a trustless computing platform where devs can run software and have realistic guarantees its execution won't be tampered with and users can verify the software they're interacting with does what they are told and both devs and node owners can't change that without them noticing. 

This could be more than enough for many use cases, but when the IC has been and currently still is sold as an alternative to existing L1s, which offer another set of features like immutability and uncensorability then I can't help but feel cheated a bit.

If we lived in a world defined by ourselves, you would be right. However, we live in a world defined by others. Specifically, a world defined by governments, which have a monopoly on law creation and the violent enforcement of these laws. 

Dfinity understands the necessity of compliance, evidenced by the KYC process they established. 

It is essential we foster the conditions for longevity. If NPs registered today in order to be compliant with local jurisdictions but in the future it became unnecessary there would be nothing to stop them from dropping off line and re-deploying nodes anonymously.

[/quote]

One of the reasons crypto was created and attracted so many (before and fraudsters opportunists joined the party) was precisely to get away from that.

Now if Dfinity has different plans for the IC I'm cool with it, the platform still has use cases and amazing tech but they shouldn't claim to have solved the trilemma or compare the IC to other projects which have a different scope.

[quote="NickM, post:17, topic:16501"]

[/quote]

There would be years of fine tuning the network to work with a different set of assumptions to stop them. Dfinity is focusing its manpower to improve the protocol to work better under the current topology of the network: tokenomics, cycle pricing, finality, block size, etc.. are fine tuned for a permissioned network with powerful nodes running in data centers with guaranteed up time, moving to anonymous nodes throws all of that away, it might be possible in the future to have anonymous nodes on dedicated subnets, but it's unclear how well they will perform and by that point clearthere could be other protocols, which have focused their efforts on a decentralized vision only, that are just a better fit. 

Again I'm not saying it's a bad choice, only time will tell, but Dfinity should be honest about what the IC is and aims to be, cause I see a cognitive dissonance between recent communications and the pre Genesis pitch.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-11-13 16:05:10 UTC | #19

Of  course the IC has solved the trilemma. These other choices are not for lack of a solution to the trilemma problem.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-11-13 17:12:15 UTC | #20

It is absolutely appropriate to pursue an ideal which is superior to the nation state model. 

I put this journey into the same context as the Industrial Revolution. 

It will take decades.

Let's create the conditions for growth and adoption today, tomorrow and next year. Our future selves can deal with the issues five, ten, twenty and thirty years hence.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-11-13 19:19:31 UTC | #22

You are right, but there is an important observation that must be taken into account:

At this moment in time most of our daily commercial activities (and those of NPs) are not limited to environments that support SmartContracts. We are in a transitionary stage in which the legacy system is an inescapable practical reality.

[quote="Motokoder, post:21, topic:16501"]
People break legal contracts every day regardless of the consequences.
[/quote]

That is true, but what worries me the most is the consequences might not even be there in IC case cause:

1) Identifying people reliably in a decentralized manner is very hard if not impossible.

2) It's not sure if and how the self-declaration is legally enforceable.

Even as an temporary solution, the system proposed by Dfinity seems flaky and might eventually be exploited once the network holds enough value. If the 2 points I've mentioned aren't solved, there is nothing stopping a well funded organization from adding many nodes under different NP accounts other than the sum of money required to buy enough rigs to obtain a subnet's control.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-11-13 20:15:52 UTC | #26

[quote="Motokoder, post:25, topic:16501"]
this risk is greater with anonymous nodes, but decreases as the network grows
[/quote]

It is if subnets' node count stays the same and without automatic node rotation between subnets. The latter has already been discussed and might be eventually be implemented, on the other side a node increase big enough to make anonymous node as safe if not safer than deterministic decentralization is unlikely to happen for 2 reasons:

1) As the subnet grows in size time to finality increases too, this could be solved by implementing something out of Dfinity's original design for the IC: randomly sized committees. 

https://youtu.be/9HRurPVF3Pg?t=738

2) With bigger subnets, the tokens minted to pay the node providers would increase linearly, I'm already not certain whether the IC can become deflationary in its current state, let alone if subnets had between 400-1000 nodes in them (number of nodes planned in the original design), that's a x30-x70 increase in minted tokens per subnet, so either operational costs for devs would have to be increased or providers rewards decreased, both by a LARGE margin. That is in my opinion unfeaseble with the current protocol revenue structure.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-11-13 20:32:03 UTC | #27

Everything that isn't crypto is legacy. From purchasing a building, getting local business licenses, paying for energy and paying employees, leasing a car and buying lunch. 

But @Motokoder, everything in life is transitory because the Status Quo is "change". The world your great-grandparents inhabited as adults was not the same the world your grandparents inhabited as adults which was different from the one of your parents inhabited, etc...

But we have digressed massively.

The original question was for comments on the content of a form to be completed by future NPs. 

I think it is a good idea.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-11-13 20:34:16 UTC | #28

The point of the NNS , well besides to govern the network, is to make a potential disappearance of the foundation uneventful. The NNS is the gatekeeper. It is solely responsible for onboarding new node providers.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-11-13 20:43:52 UTC | #29

[quote="SvenF, post:1, topic:16501"]
Second, new NP will have a substantial stake in the IC through the investment in HW Infrastructure for running their nodes. As described by Dom in his recent article ([Blogpost Dom ](https://medium.com/dfinity/lets-grow-the-internet-computer-network-why-and-how-and-general-updates-1c8d0770a299)), NPs are not required to stake ICP, but the HW investment ensures that the NP has sufficient incentive to ensure to run nodes efficiently and reliably.
[/quote]

I also don't agree with this statement by Dom. A stake in ETH:
- ideally increases in value.
- is locked in the protocol.
- can be slashed as soon as the node misbehaves, causing an instant monetary loss and can be slashed to 0, causing a complete loss on the initial investment.

Hardware:
- loses value as time goes on.
- can be resold or repurposed. 
- the penalty for misbehaving nodes is reducing future rewards, which ironically also reduces the incentives for that provider to behave correctly, especially once the initial investment has already been paid off by rewards, at that point the provider has no real incentive not to misbehave other than losing a revenue stream.

Dear all,

The motion proposal for the self-declaration process is live, please find it here: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/98547 and vote to adopt the proposal if you support this decentralized Self Declaration solution as part of the NP onboarding process.

Thanks all for your comments in this thread. Based on your feedback and that from the Node Providers, the process was further simplified by allowing a business registration document (if the Node Provider is a business entity) or any personal identification document (if the Node Provider is not a business entity), as long as the documents can be verified by the community. No other changes have been made compared to the draft proposal.

Some relevant feedback has been received, and the process will need to be refined further in the future, for which new proposals will be submitted. To summarize, some of the comments and suggestions for a future process are:

* How to store and share the self-declaration forms on the Internet Computer wiki, making it visible to the community as a whole.
* Storing a hash of signed self-declaration forms as part of the NNS proposal for new NP.
* Investigate whether self-declaration forms can be stored on-chain.
* Type of documents valid for the identification of a business entity.
* Leveraging existing processes like Internet Identity to improve the self-declaration process.
* Community and legal measures that could be applied when not acting in accordance with the self-declaration.
* Future decentralization of the self-declaration process.
* How to apply this process for different geographies and countries.

Please continue to share any additional thoughts and suggestions on the self-declaration process in this Forum thread, looking forward to your suggestions!

Will Dfinity educate the public on how to effectively run a KYC process? How is the community to know if the self-declaration provided isn't just fabricated by the Node Provider?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-26 13:15:15 UTC | #38

ICDevs will vote accept because it is nice to have a process, but it seems that this is ultimately up to the community and voter to verify.  We need a better set of institutions/groups to validate and endorse. Ideally we'd be able to follow a group of knowledgeable names neurons that are voting in admiring neurons and holding them to a standard. ICDevs does not intend to do this vetting ourselves and it would be outside our mission to do so.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-26 13:51:08 UTC | #39

This is another example of needing to have a way to incentivize people or organizations who are willing to perform this type of work.  We are effectively asking people to perform real work as volunteers.  I just don't see how this is sustainable.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-26 16:03:42 UTC | #40

We have a gap between "dfinity does this and I trust them" and "I need to take responsibility for this". 

Theory: If dfinity stopped voting on replica management then node providers would be forced to get involved in verification. Why? Because iI'd submit a replica that sent me an ICP every block.😈

-------------------------

SvenF | 2022-12-29 15:24:23 UTC | #41

In a fully decentralised network, I agree there should be a group of people that take on the responsbility for the onboarding process including the KYC procedures. ICDevs might not have affinity or incentive to do this, but node providers would have. Node providers are currently already sharing experiences with running nodes. Managing the KYC procedures could be another joint effort. Dfinity being also a node provider itself could take the initial lead and bring the node providers together on to discuss this. What do you think?

Is this not what the IC is? This is more along the lines of what I think the IC is and maybe should be. All the talk of basically subverting governments is possibly dangerous, shady, and reckless. I know there's a lot of nuance and we've chatted before, but I just don't feel comfortable getting on board with the idea that we can deploy any piece of software that is above the control of any legal society on Earth.

And even if we could deploy truly unstoppable software, governments could sanction it and effectively stop its mainstream use. And mainstream use is maybe the most worthy goal in my mind.

Maybe a better statement is: what you described sounds like a more practical and realistic vision for the IC.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-12-29 17:23:10 UTC | #43

Yep that's what it is and it'd be completely fine if that's what we were originally promised and currently being advertised, but it is not.

Watching the old presentations, some of which I've linked, Dom paints a very different picture:
https://youtu.be/5b3DMghlCzg

The vision might have changed over the years and if so it should be reflected in the marketing approach. If the IC is more of an AWS with blockchain features than a decentralized and sovereign world computer then it doesn't make sense to compare it with other protocols, which try to solve a whole separate set of issues, to flex its capabilities.

It'd be like saying a commercial airplane is superior to the space shuttle cause they both fly but the former is cheaper and carries more people, true but completely ignores the fact the shuttle can go to space. The crypto industry is trying to build a commercial shuttle, is it possible? Who knows, but it definitely is not ICP and should not be sold as such.

Sormarler | 2022-12-30 10:26:36 UTC | #44

It's a decentralized world computer just like other gen 3 smart contract platforms.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-12-30 15:36:18 UTC | #45

I wonder if a slightly different take is more accurate, or maybe I'm about to say the same thing in a different way.

The IC is a decentralized computer like the rest of the blockchains, but it has chosen a different set of trade-offs.

Various blockchains have their various trade-offs, but generally they all seek decentralized compute as the end goal.

First, I want to applaud the individual(s) who drafted this template. 

However, I am concerned that this is not/ will not withhold in any US court system. From my view, this is as legally binding as a homemade contract between two friends with no notarization. It may/ may not hold up in court systems. 

There are serious repercussions/ implied liabilities that could actually cause harm. However, if this document is not notarized and legally binding then it is sadly, just a fancy motion proposal. I applaud and agree with its intentions. I just feel this should be something we actively test in court systems on our own. 

For example, DFINITY should run a "test Node" and test all of these scenarios in court without any impact. Simply run a node separately and test these different things with legal teams or mediators. They obviously have legal staff retained for the NPO. I feel we should assume this will happen in due time. If/when it does we should not be leaving it to a motion proposal. 

they could do something like this

1. run the node and maliciously attack it themselves through the various vulnerabilities currently. 

2. "take themselves to court" instead of waiting for it to be used against them or the blockchain. They could use the legal staff to do mediation with these scenarios and test all of the options and come back with fixes to the holes in the current system.

3. Instead of having others "attack them" we could be preemptive and "attack ourselves" for the sake of ironing out these details. 

4. Hire a notary to make documents such as these truly legally binding not just by the blockchain but by US court systems.

What if, we neglect these issues and "just wait and see" and because of that a court system flexes its muscles and poof? All of these make no difference because they forced boundary nodes down and US investors lose access to their neurons/ NNS dapp 

Are we really leaving it up to a (well-written) motion proposal? I just don't see it playing out in court the way people might assume or feel it should under these terms/ limitations to hold anyone truly liable for malicious attacks or interference.

Anonymous nodes = safety in numbers provided by statistics and game theory
Known Node = illusion of safety provided by an imperfect and cheatable system (KYC)

Cann't agree with you more.

If the 2 points I’ve mentioned aren’t solved, there is nothing stopping a well funded organization from adding many nodes under different NP accounts other than the sum of money required to buy enough rigs to obtain a subnet’s control.

This is exactly what I am most worried about, they can control the nodes, do evil to gain enough value and then let the IC to die.

Even in areas where the law is functioning effectively, the law only provides minimal protection, do you see how long has it been since the mtgox bankruptcy was effectively handled? Do you see the global loss of customers due to ftx being compensated because sbf was punished? We do live in a world where the government makes the rules, but I think one of the core values of blockchain is to create a trustless environment, thus preventing fraud and break legal contracts

t is if subnets’ node count stays the same and without automatic node rotation between subnets. The latter has already been discussed and might be eventually be implemented, on the other side a node increase big enough to make anonymous node as safe if not safer than deterministic decentralization is unlikely to happen for 2 reasons:

1. As the subnet grows in size time to finality increases too, this could be solved by implementing something out of Dfinity’s original design for the IC: randomly sized committees.

![|480x360](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/dfn/original/2X/5/52ab79de7b9c3ecc3e328cbd035395381c3d373b.jpeg "DFINITY: Scalable consensus with threshold groups - BPASE '18")

2. With bigger subnets, the tokens minted to pay the node providers would increase linearly, I’m already not certain whether the IC can become deflationary in its current state, let alone if subnets had between 400-1000 nodes in them (number of nodes planned in the original design), that’s a x30-x70 increase in minted tokens per subnet, so either operational costs for devs would have to be increased or providers rewards decreased, both by a LARGE margin. That is in my opinion unfeaseble with the current protocol revenue structure.

Effective and reasonable economic incentives are an important basis for IC to be sustainable, and the issues you mention are what concerns me.
According to the current incentive method, I think it is a subsidy strategy, similar to the planned economy model, this strategy lacks the flexibility space for DAPP increase/reduction, the increase/decrease of nodes is not flexibly adjusted because of the increase/decrease of IC network's demand for computing/storage, the nodes are just a kind of positions with specific salary, and the lack of flexible strategy for salary adjustment will lead to the increase /decrease at an unreasonable level for a long time.
At the same time, the lack of pledge mechanism makes the NPs lack of interests consistent with the IC network as a whole, and once the NPs find a way to do evil to gain more revenue, the NPs betray the whole IC network.

I also don’t agree with this statement by Dom. A stake in ETH:

* ideally increases in value.
* is locked in the protocol.
* can be slashed as soon as the node misbehaves, causing an instant monetary loss and can be slashed to 0, causing a complete loss on the initial investment.

Hardware:

* loses value as time goes on.
* can be resold or repurposed.
* the penalty for misbehaving nodes is reducing future rewards, which ironically also reduces the incentives for that provider to behave correctly, especially once the initial investment has already been paid off by rewards, at that point the provider has no real incentive not to misbehave other than losing a revenue stream.

The important thing is that dom is done in a way that doesn't align the interests of the NP and the IC network, the NP is more like an employed person, and employed people leaving and joining a new company happens every day in this world (the NP can use the hardware they put in now to do provide other services, or even sell that hardware).

As a member of the IC community, I don't think the ETH pledge is the best model, but at least with this model, the interests of the ETH POS pledgee and the ETH network are aligned, what is the IC model for aligning the interests of the NP and the IC network?

The IC is a decentralized computer like the rest of the blockchains, but it has chosen a different set of trade-offs.
[/quote]

So it depends on where the trade-offs are.
If the trade-off is on core features, such as the decentralization mechanism, such an IC has no future if a small group of people can use the funds to completely control the IC network.

So I would expect a better mechanism for NP incentives to ensure that ICs do not have flaws in their decentralization capabilities.

The current way of self-declaration does not look like a better way than POS pledging of ETH, even if there are some legal protections behind such declaration.
