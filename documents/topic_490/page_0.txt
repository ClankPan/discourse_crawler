Hello community!

V0.5.2 of the SDK is now available for download! :nerd_face: :tada:

**What's new?**
* Support for nesting of option values.
Option type in Javascript now expects a singleton array as value. A  `none`  value is represented as  `[]` ;  `some value`  is represented as  `[value]` .

* You can use the  `dfx bootstrap`  command to start the bootstrap web server defined in the  `dfx.json`  configuration file or specified using command-line options.

* You can use the  `-c`  or  `--compute-allocation`  flag for  `dfx canister install`  command to specify a canisterâ€™s compute allocation as a percentage.
This is essentially the equivalent of setting CPU allocation for canister execution. In a development environment, you might use this option for testing purposes if you have applications that require multiple canisters.

**Issues fixed in this release:**
* The  `nodemanager`  process has been removed.
* Bug fix for  `slebEncode` .

Cheers!
