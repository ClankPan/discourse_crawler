Following the tutorial "Hello, World! Rust CDK Quick Start". https://smartcontracts.org/docs/rust-guide/rust-quickstart.html

It gives me the following error:

```
/rust_hello> dfx deploy

The solution in the following post does not work.-> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/error-e0463-when-trying-to-run-internet-identity/4816

any ideas? 

openSUSE TW, Rust and rustup from repos.

Solution:
Delete rust from the repositories, and install it from:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
