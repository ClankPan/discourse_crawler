Hi everyone,

I am playing around with Internet Identity. I am following this great guide:
https://kyle-peacock.com/blog/dfinity/integrating-internet-identity

However there is a slight problem: the author explicitly warns us:
"*Signatures from identity.ic0.app won't be accepted on your local replica.*"

Is there any workaround?
Cheers

Because I can't modify my question (403) I want to add here that I have the Yubikey USB stick so I can create identities.What I don't know is how to create (at least) one identity which is accepted on local replica.

Thanks

For now, the best thing to do is clone https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/ and run it locally. You'll need to point the login method to the local Internet Identity instance during development under the `identityProvider` argument when calling `AuthClient.login`.

Also see https://github.com/dfinity/cancan/blob/main/docs/local-with-internet-identity.md for how the CanCan project handles this.
