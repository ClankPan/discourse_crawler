In canlista, we can see canister running status and controllers.

Using javascript/agent how to get controllers and running status of a provided canisterId?

If not, how to get this information? motoko/rust ?

using dfx we can get by
`dfx canister --network ic info ivcos-eqaaa-aaaab-qablq-cai`

```
Controllers: hgfyw-myaaa-aaaab-qaaoa-cai
Module hash: 0x2d8060fe316775976ad0a33975e846e98b649536be51c8bcf33a7c61806041c6
```

How to achieve same by JS?

I tried this last week ðŸ‘‰ https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-make-ic-management-api-canister-status-call-with-dfinity-agent/7139/2?u=peterparker

@peterparker Your approach doesn't seems to give controllers info for anonymous identity.

But, by using nns/lifeline - [rno2w-sqaaa-aaaaa-aaacq-cai](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=rno2w-sqaaa-aaaaa-aaacq-cai) canister and method `canister_status` I am able get Canister's controllers information as an error

any other cleaner approach to get controllers and canister running, module hash status using js?

At the end of the day I deferred the work to the backend canister in a [custom function](https://github.com/papyrs/ic/blob/6dc3743952690befec3b61da52e89a104a691bd0/canisters/src/manager/manager.mo#L169) so that's an alternative. You implement the function in your canister and from js you call your own custom function.
