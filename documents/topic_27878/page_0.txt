The ICP ecosystem will actively participate at [ETH Denver 2024](https://www.ethdenver.com/). 

**In-person hackathon bounties** (Due Saturday, March 2nd)

ICP will offer up to $25,000 in prizes at the in-person hackathon between two tracks:

[**Extending Ethereum with ICP**](https://ethdenver2024.devfolio.co/prizes?partner=Internet+Computer)

ICP offers two key capabilities for cross-chain integration: threshold ECDSA signing and HTTPS outcalls. In addition, features such as large smart contract storage (400GiB), fast consensus (~1s), high execution capacity, timers, on-chain encryption (vetKeys), a bridgeless native Bitcoin integration, and decentralized frontend hosting make it possible to build cross-chain dapps that aren’t possible to build anywhere else.


[**Open Bounty: ICP is Awesome**](https://ethdenver2024.devfolio.co/prizes?partner=Internet+Computer)

This is an open bounty for the most innovative use of ICP technology. ICP adds autonomous serverless cloud functionality to the public Internet – making it possible to build almost any system or service entirely on a decentralized network using “canister smart contracts,” that can host frontends, interact with other chains and web2 services, and keep secrets. For this bounty, you should use ICP technology most innovatively and build the coolest dapp showcasing as many of the superpowers of ICP as possible. This bounty also allows you to build innovative compositions with bounties of other sponsors.

To get the full details of the bounties, please visit the [ICP Bounty page at ETH Denver](https://ethdenver2024.devfolio.co/prizes?partner=Internet+Computer).
