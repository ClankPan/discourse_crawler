Support / Questions

Hi everyone! I'm new to blockchain and Internet Identity, but I've recently joined a project where we have a canister setup (I can interact with the canister UI).

We already have an application, but the login process and fetch data are currently handled on the frontend. We're now considering creating backend services, and I'm facing a challenge with the authentication process. For instance, to get patient information, a user needs to log in, if success an Identity is generated to make the request, like this:

```
const api = createActor(patientCanisterId, { agent: AppAgent(identity) });
const response = await api.get_patient_info();
```

My question is: Is it possible to send the Identity to the backend (using Nest.js) so that the backend can handle the `get_patient_info` request instead of the frontend? Thank you!
