TLDR; MergeMaturity (a type of merge_neuron request) is being retired, and will return a GovernanceError, starting in about a month.

# Deprecating MergeMaturity
Hello ICPeople.

As per the motion proposal [“Compounding Maturity”](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623), merging maturity has been replaced by staking maturity. As part of the transition, since January of 2023, when a user asks to merge maturity via a `MergeMaturity` action in a `manage_neuron` request, the maturity is being staked instead of minted into ICP. The changes were discussed in this forum [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387/47).

To complete the transition, and given that `MergeMaturity` redirects to `StakeMaturity` already, we plan to remove support for `MergeMaturity` actions.

After it is removed, it will return a `GovernanceError` indicating that the functionality is not available with that request, and that `StakeMaturity` is an equivalent call.

For some time after this change, if we find out that there is a compelling reason to keep forwarding available from `MergeMaturity` to `StakeMaturity`, this change can be reversed.

When it is safe to remove `MergeMaturity` from the API without breaking clients, we may completely remove `MergeMaturity` from the API, at least 6 months after it has been returning a `GovernanceError`.
