I was wondering why https://www.internetcomputer.org/ cannot provide multi-language? So that more and more ppl could learn espeically the ones that don't know English. See https://ethereum.org/zh/languages/ as an example.

Right now it's mostly a matter of resources. We don't have the people (or time) to translate everything. And we'd probably have to restructure our deployment setup quite significantly because it's currently really not set up for it.

Thanks for the reply. I understand, maybe we could learn from ethereum or other teams, seems that some translation work is driven by the community, but I don't know if the quality can be guaranteed or not.
