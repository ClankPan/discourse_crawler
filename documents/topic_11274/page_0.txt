The current Dfinity Ledger wasm is too large, even after minimisation, to be deployed to the IC for testing purposes. Does anyone have a version of the ledger wasm that is under the 2mb limit? After optimising, I am seeing a file-size of roughly 2.5 mb. 

Cheers

Hi @Maxfinity !

We optimized the size of the Ledger canister in scope of the "Ledger canister fit for dapps" feature (https://medium.com/dfinity/the-internet-computers-post-genesis-r-d-roadmap-dce2938adcde). The Wasm module should now be below 2MiB ([this commit](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/a5379d14fe0abba18d0ec8fe479b530eec52f609) did the trick if you're curious).

Could you please try following [the local setup instructions](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/rosetta-api/ledger-local-setup.html) but use a fresh commit from the IC repo in the first step (e.g., `export IC_VERSION=c7ec4881cf8db619aab86a148010b74f58e3ef37`)?

Hello Max,

For canister wasm larger than 2mb (egress message size limit) and smaller than 5mb (intra canister message limit tbc) -- 
You might be able to deploy the canister via a canister;

Here is an example (not really well documented) about how to achieve this: https://github.com/origyn-sa/large_canister_deployer_internal
https://github.com/ORIGYN-SA/large_canister_deployer_internal/blob/master/chunker_appender/index.js#L50

Make sure that the "larger canister deployer" canister and the target canister are in the same subnet;

Hi @Maxfinity!

> none of these commits work unfortunately - the first is unfortunately slightly too large and the second has an invalid gz format.

I looked into that issue, it turns out that there was recently a refactoring in the CI pipeline that introduced a glitch making the canister larger again.

You can use this commit hash to get a reasonably small ledger canister: `77cecc596216a584174106733b40513645641fef`

Thanks for reporting the issue and sorry for the inconvenience.

Why does this page again point to a ledger canister that is too big and not deployable? This is still a year after launch and yet the public docs do not have a canister that is deployable locally...despite 3 interventions from this forum thread... 

I recommend an automated check before tagging.

You can gzip it and deploy it now.  Hopefully, dfx will do this for us soon? Maybe?  Please?

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-06-02 06:13:39 UTC | #9

This step was missing from the installation instructions:
```
Configure your replica to run a `System` subnet. Modify `dfx.json` to include:
     {
       "defaults":{
         "replica": {
           "subnet_type":"system"
         }
       }
     }
```
Adding it ASAP.

domwoe | 2022-06-02 09:58:55 UTC | #10

Hey Max,

I noticed this a while ago myself. This is because dfx 0.10.0 uses an application subnet with stricter limits by default. I added a note in step 9 of the docs yesterday. But it's probably better to include this as a default step as @Severin has done in the [Github readme](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/rosetta-api/ledger_canister).

@roman-kashitsyn shared this concern about doing it on behalf of users.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-and-improved-rust-cdk-first-class-support-for-rust-canister-development/10399/37?u=paulyoung

Perhaps an entry in `dfx.json` to easily enable or disable it (depending on the default) would be a good compromise.

PeanutNJam | 2022-06-26 17:53:07 UTC | #12

Has this issue been resolved? I still get errors for .wasm binaries. The gzip version did not work for me either, as specified in the Ledger setup on smartcontracts.org, but then I went into the examples on github and gave chmod 777 permissions to ledger.private.did/-public.did/-.wasm. I made dfx.json as per the updates in 0.9.3:

{
  "canisters": {
    "ledger": { 
      "type": "custom",
      "wasm": "src/ledger/ledger.wasm",

      "remote": {
        "candid": "src/ledger/ledger.public.did",

      "main": "src/musall/main.mo",
      "type": "motoko",
      "dependencies": [ "ledger"]
    },
.......

And still I get this error:

Does anyone know a work around please? This same issue of size is observed with II canister, where I get a error 5 code, and can't get the build done. I assumed it was my ubuntu, then I upgraded and its still there. Then I tried on a Mac-m1, and still this error. I also tried to build the interface myself using didc bind ledger.did -t ts > blablabla, and I can then call the functions on frontend, but still I am not able to complete my mocking of the Ledger/II in this way. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

PS: also note the project I have worked in the Hackathon was able to run on my team mates machine without problems. So its quite strange, and hence my immediately changing the local machine setup.

IIRC a replica version that accepts gzipped files only entered dfx with 0.10.0. Can you try with a later version that 0.9.3?

Thanks for replying: I'm using dfx 0.10.1 at present. So I guess dfx versions is not the issue. As an aside note: I suspected this so I tried to dfx toolchain install 0.10.0,  and 0.9.3, to see if versions were the problem, but when looking into .cache I found that my versions included a full installation with moc of 0.10.1 (default) and only empty 10.0 and 9.3. (if you know how have to multiple dfx setup send that link please). Have you got any other suggestions of how I can get unstuck, please let me know, I have the xcode, cli-tools setup as well. And my ubunti is upto date. I also develop in wat2wasm on my Ubuntu to call from nodejs and I can easily do this. What could possibly be stopping this build. Shall I build the entire ledger and II with moc?

If you want to use a different version of dfx, it's best to install it using `DFX_VERSION=0.10.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"`. Substitute version numbers as needed. I honestly don't know how the toolchain command really works.

Do you have the `ic-cdk-optimizer` installed? If not, try `cargo install ic-cdk-optimizer` and then run it over the wasm first. Does that maybe help?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2022-06-27 08:24:51 UTC | #16

How did you get the `ledger.wasm` ?

Did you use the following as described [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/functionality/ledger/ledger-local-setup) ?
```
export IC_VERSION=dd3a710b03bd3ae10368a91b255571d012d1ec2f
curl -o ledger.wasm.gz https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/${IC_VERSION}/canisters/ledger-canister_notify-method.wasm.gz
gunzip ledger.wasm.gz
```
I'm just asking because there are different versions of the ledger.wasm floating around. This specific version is optimized to be small enough to be deployed on an application subnet. In earlier versions of dfx the included replica was configured to act like a system subnet which is less restricted than application subnets.

-------------------------

PeanutNJam | 2022-06-27 09:49:01 UTC | #17

So I work in two projects( lets say Musall and MusicNova), both giving problems locally with II and Ledger wasm on ubuntu and Mac-m1, but installed differently in each. What I described above is for Musall, where I used the dfinity/examples/motoko/defi/ ledger versions repo at: https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/defi (its up to date). I just copied these and installed as described in the release notes for 0.9.3. I might be wrong but these wasm and their associated .did are legitimate since I checked them line for line with the .did descriptions for II and nns-ledger on canLista. Now for MusicNova the II is installed via curl call in dfx.json as described on GitHub for the official II ->   

```

"canisters": {
    "internet_identity": {
      "__0": "The development build of Internet Identity. For more information, see https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity#build-features-and-flavors",

      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "internet_identity.did",
      "wasm": "internet_identity.wasm",

      "__1": "There is no standard way to pull remote canisters, so instead we have a dummy build script that",
      "__2": "simply downloads the Internet Identity canister. See also: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/2085",
      "build": "curl -sSL https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity_dev.wasm -o internet_identity.wasm"
    },
.....
```

So I am pretty sure we have the correct II and Ledger wasm. 
I have the latest rustup, rustc, cmake, wasm-wasi, they all work individually when tested on a simple hello-world file reader. The MusicNova gives this error exactly when building, please note I do have the ic-cdk-optimizer installed before running dfx ..(cargo install ic-cdk-optimizer) ->

thanks for all feedback. The funny thing about the optimiser is that I build it with cargo install and gives a message of successful, yet when I cargo build I get this -> ignoring invalid dependency `ic-cdk-optimizer` which is missing a lib target. On crate.io its marked with a red notice, that its not a library, but either way it should still install. I tried various ways to build it but always get some error which I assume is incorrect since I get a success message. here is the .toml ->

```
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
candid = "0.7.14"
ic-cdk = "0.5.1"
ic-cdk-macros = "0.5.1"
serde = "1.0.137"

[build-dependencies]
walkdir = "2.3.2"
syn = { version = "1.0.96", features = ["full"] }
ic-cdk-optimizer = "0.3.4"
```

which shouldn't be necessary since I already cargo install ic-cdk-optimizer = "0.3.4". If I run it again I get -> 

```
 Updating crates.io index
     Ignored package `ic-cdk-optimizer v0.3.4` is already installed, use --force to override
```
as expected.

In the console. You have to manually download (and unzip) the `ledger.wasm`. Make sure that downloading worked. I have issues with copy & paste because it prefixes the curly braces with backslashes and then you download a 404 doc instead of the ledger wasm.

This version of the ledger seems too big. It will only work if you install it on a system subnet as described [earlier in this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ledger-wasm-too-big/11274/9?u=domwoe).

It's not intended to be in the dependencies. dfx automatically calls `ic-cdk-optimizer` to reduce wasm size AFTER compilation if it's installed.

Thank you both for assisting me. I got it downloaded, and its unzipped and seems to run at least a bit before an internal error stops the canister build. At least I have overcome my initial error with a too large wasm, and learned some things, now I get a different error -> progress I guess. FYI I put the error here as its internal in .rs and you might know where this is happening ->

We are bad at communicating, that's all. [This entry](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/release-notes/#refactor-optimize-from-ic-wasm) in the release notes means that `ic-cdk-optimizer` is no longer needed. The same optimization is now done through `ic-wasm`. And `ic-wasm` is included in dfx now, so you don't need an external installation of `ic-cdk-optimizer` anymore.

This only applies to canisters with `"type": "rust"`, so `custom` canisters still would need manual calls to some optimizer.

Let me see if I can get that line in the changelog clarified. (And maybe even our communication improved?) EDIT: does this help? [PR here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/pull/2358) and [here](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/pull/316)

Thanks! So I'm using type: custom canisters (building Azle, the TypeScript CDK). I'd like to remove the need for the user to install ic-cdk-optimizer and have it run for them on dfx deploy. Even if I have to run it for them, I'd love to use the new library that doesn't require installing ic-cdk-optimizer. I'll look at those links and hopefully I can figure it out.

I doubt this is possible with dfx as-is. It doesn't expose anything that will _only_ optimize the wasm.

I'd love to be able to turn this feature on somehow for canisters of type custom, perhaps the dfx.json could have a configuration for this.

paulyoung | 2022-07-19 18:34:29 UTC | #30

I’m AFK but I’m curious if `ic-wasm` gets put in the cache directory by `dfx` (like `moc`, etc)

Either way, it looks simple enough to call manually:

https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm

@lastmjs not sure if this lends itself well to your use case though.

@Severin, in https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/2199#issuecomment-1125992831 you were open to examples for reworking the custom build command.

I’m not sure if this topic qualifies but it at least seems related.

No, we use `ic-wasm` as a crate in dfx because bundling an executable in the cache is more annoying. (Code [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/dfx/src/lib/builders/rust.rs#L96-L104) if you're interested)

In case you want to look at the cache you can do so with `ls "$(dfx cache show)"`

In [Post-build step for asset canister fails because directory is considered to be outside the workspace root · Issue #2199 · dfinity/sdk · GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/issues/2199#issuecomment-1125992831) you were open to examples for reworking the custom build command.

I’m not sure if this topic qualifies but it at least seems related.

I think having a way to run `ic-wasm` on the produced wasm is a very reasonable ask since this problem will not only happen with Rust but other languages as well. Added to our backlog.

I just started using `ic-wasm` and it cut the file size in half.

How are you using ic-wasm? As in during the build process, how are you setting that up?

I'm using nix flakes, so I have this entry in my `flake.nix` file which sets up the binary:

```
          packages.ic-wasm = naersk-lib.buildPackage rec {
            pname = "ic-wasm";
            root = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
              name = "ic-wasm-src";
              src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
                owner = "dfinity";
                repo = "ic-wasm";
                rev = "2e876e84953e24e6a1820aa524f228c8edea4307";
                sha256 = "sha256-0E7Qa0tOtFwV6pkZsjvkGE2TGaj/30+JSlNGtiU0xYo=";
              };
              installPhase = ''
                cp -R --preserve=mode,timestamps . $out
              '';
            };
            cargoBuildOptions = x: x ++ [
              "--package" pname
            ];
            cargoTestOptions = x: x ++ [
              "--package" pname
            ];
          };
```

Then I call `ic-wasm` as a post-install step when building my backend canister:

```
          packages.backend = naersk-lib.buildPackage rec {
            pname = "my-project";
            root = ./backend;
            nativeBuildInputs = [] ++ pkgs.lib.optionals pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin [
              pkgs.libiconv
            ];
            cargoBuildOptions = x: x ++ [
              "--package" pname
              "--target" "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
            ];
            cargoTestOptions = x: x ++ [
              "--package" pname
              "--target" "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
            ];
            compressTarget = false;
            copyBins = false;
            copyTarget = true;
            postInstall = ''
              MY_PROJECT_WASM=$out/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my_project.wasm
              ${packages.ic-wasm}/bin/ic-wasm -o $MY_PROJECT_WASM $MY_PROJECT_WASM shrink
            '';
          };
```

Actually, I am curious why adding ciborium reduced the wasm size.  serde_cbor is not removed from the lockfile in that PR.  Does serde_cbor generate a mass of code using macros?  At the moment it looks like a case of: "I made it bigger so that it would become smaller", which usually only works when the original is about to implode anyway.

>  serde_cbor is not removed from the lockfile in that PR.

We had to continue using serde_cbor for transaction deduplication reasons. Luckily, there we needed only the encoding logic.

> Does serde_cbor generate a mass of code using macros?

The bloat seems to come from serde_cbor's decoding logic (most likely, from generic function instantiations), which we replaced with ciborium in the referenced commit.

As an update on the optimizers, `ic-wasm` now wraps `wasm-opt` similarly to how `ic-cdk-optimizer` use to work.
