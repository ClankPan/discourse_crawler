Hello everyone!

I wanted to share with you an exciting project that we are building - FormyFi. Decentralized & fully on-chain forms. Powered by ICP.
Toolset for conducting surveys in Web3, ensuring security and completeness of data.

Formyfi simplifies the process for users of all skill levels to design on-brand, engaging, and interactive forms and surveys, enhancing engagement and conversion rates.

On the slides below you can see what problem we are solving by leveraging ICP tech.

Technological stack:
- SCSS
- JS / VueJS
- Motoko

Our tool has close to infinite number of use cases, and targets not only big companies but anyone with a need of conducting a poll or survey.

And even more use cases:
 - In order to vote on DAO/proposals, you must answer questions about it. If you don't answer correctly, it means you haven't read the proposal, and you can't vote just blindly.
 - Elections, respond about the election campaign of the candidate and then vote.

Once the product is fully built, it'll be unmatchable.

The monetization strategy is similar to Typeform and other similar projects.

In the nearest future we would like to apply for a grant to implement next features (see below)

Status of the project and Go-To-Market strategy.

We just finished building an MVP, which can be already checked out and we already gathering our first users to test a product. Once we implement gamification elements and some more features we are planning to launch a big user acquisition campaign.
