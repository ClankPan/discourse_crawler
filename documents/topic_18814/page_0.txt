I think though much has been done to get the word out there about what the IC is and how it will change the world. We still need more IC centric media to capture IC stories on the people working in this space and the things being worked on and the discussions being had in this space.

So my contribution is to create a the blog [8yrgang](https://8yrgang.com) with the aim of growing it to be a hub for all stories IC.

I would love feedback on this proposal and I invite any offers from contributors.
