Hello!! How feasible is it that push notifications can be sent to different devices from a canister? I saw that there is a team working on the implementation of web sockets. Will it be possible to extend the functionality that is being worked on and achieve the implementation of push notifications from the canister itself that requires it?

Hi ArielRobotti!
Check out this thread https://forum.dfinity.org/t/websockets-on-the-ic-a-proof-of-concept/20836 for some news about the websocket thing. Push notifications from the canister are a fitting use case, but keep in mind this is just a proof-of-concept for now.
