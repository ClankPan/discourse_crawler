As titled state Iâ€™m looking for an example of the JavaScript agent being used with a cli.

?

Do you mean like a CLI command executing a node script that includes a call to the IC via the JS agent?

Not sure exactly neither what you are looking for neither.

In Juno got plenty of NodeJS scripts ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/tree/main/scripts](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/tree/main/scripts)

To load the identity from the pem file of dfx I use the solution of @ZenVoich ðŸ‘‰ [https://forum.dfinity.org/t/using-dfinity-agent-in-node-js/6169/60?u=peterparker](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/using-dfinity-agent-in-node-js/6169/60?u=peterparker) 

Which I implemented in that script utils ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/9bb589e98ba04997d734cacb94e47d5ea18c8b80/scripts/identity.utils.mjs#L32](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno/blob/9bb589e98ba04997d734cacb94e47d5ea18c8b80/scripts/identity.utils.mjs#L32)
