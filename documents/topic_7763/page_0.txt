Hi
Where to find a comprehensive guide to creating a smart contract on the Internet computer , and is there such training now that we can refer to the source?
And can the idea be used by computer's Internet developers?
Thank you for your help

The developer portal is the best place to get started with all of this: [https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html)

Then tutorials like this one (see the menu on the left for more): [https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/counter-tutorial.html](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/counter-tutorial.html)

And there are some great resources on the education repo too: [https://github.com/dfinity-education](https://github.com/dfinity-education)

Feel free to ask questions if you need any help, we like puzzles!
