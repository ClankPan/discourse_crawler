The ID for the Internet Computer network, as used with `--network` option, is `"ic"`. What is the ID (as used in `--network` option) for the local deployment (http://127.0.0.1:8080/api)?

I need this, because I need to specify a remote canister for the local deployment, as in the following code, but for local network, not for `"ic"`:

```json
{
  "ledger": {
    "type": "custom",
    "candid": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/a17247bd86c7aa4e87742bf74d108614580f216d/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did",
    "wasm": "https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/a17247bd86c7aa4e87742bf74d108614580f216d/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz",
    "remote": {
      "id": {
        "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
      }
    }
  },
  "defaults":{
    "replica": {
      "subnet_type":"system"
    }
  }
}
```

I also need to decide what I specify for the canister ID. I want to specify an unexistent canister as the remote canister ID, is it possible?

The local network is called `local`. And for a non-existent canister ID I'd recommend `aaaaa-aa`, which is the management canister and cannot ever be an existing canister. But since you're not deploying that canister ever (at least in your specific case) you can use any canister ID and you'll be fine
