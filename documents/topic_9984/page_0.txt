I can't find a document that specifically describes this rule

No. A proposal needs at a minimum 3% of total voting power voting yes. Of course, it also needs either an absolute or simple majority on top of that 3% prerequisite.

Thanks, got it:
> There are two ways a proposal can be decided:
> 
> 1. **Absolute Majority** : Before the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted or rejected if an absolute majority (more than half of the total voting power, indicated by arrow_drop_down
delimiter above) has voted Yes or No on the proposal, respectively.
> 2. **Simple Majority** : When the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted if a simple majority (more than half of the votes cast) has voted Yes and those votes constitute at least 3% of the total voting power (indicated by keyboard_arrow_down delimiter above). Otherwise, the proposal is rejected. Before a proposal is decided by Simple Majority, the voting period can be extended in order to “ **wait for quiet** ”, which involves calculating a “noise level” from voting and making a decision only after the noise level has fallen sufficiently.

 **wait for quiet** Confusing me, who can decide to extend the voting period? How is the "noise level" calculated? 

This long time ago article provides some answers, thanks to Dom and BUIDL of Ethereum:

I believe the voting period is extended (i.e. wait for quiet) when the majority flips from yes to no or from no to yes. It's done algorithmically, not by any one person.
