Hello everyone! We just finished the first version of our solution DataPond.AI - a platform for securing and tracking data used by AI. Please, see the highlight summarised below. I am available to answer questions and explore synergies with ICP community members. Any feedback is welcome!

**Project highlights**

DataPond is a hub for exposing and tracing data used by AI to generate results. It enables end users and businesses to store files on Internet Computer and to control how they are consumed by AI tools as input for training, reasoning, or producing answers.

DataPond is available as an open-source toolbox for developers who want to bridge their decentralized applications with AI transparently and efficiently. On the other hand, the solution will emerge as an end-user platform helping digital creators, data providers, and businesses use AI as a new distribution channel.

**Web3 advantages**

The key advantage of DataPond is the ultimate level of transparency and traceability regarding how AI consumes data for generating results. Each interaction with the files stored on-chain on ICP generates a trail that serves as a reliable accounting of data consumption.

**Internet Computer superpowers**

Internet Computer currently is the only protocol that enables fully decentralized applications with on-chain data storage. Our canisters support the upload and storing of data on ICP which guarantees the independent functioning of DataPond's platform without any limitations and dependencies on centralized cloud infrastructure.

**Go-to-market strategy and monetization**

DataPond will be available as a free and open-source building block to boost trust and transparency in AI data usage and consumption. Our strategy is to offer DataPond as a freemium online service for uploading documents and creating chatbots connected with the provided data. In that way, we will open up a funnel with prospects and leads.

DataPond's architecture is perfect for creating collections of thematic data sets (documents, images, database records, etc.) that feed AI models to produce quality results. Our strategy is to foster the adoption of the solution by focusing on specific market segments and enhancing the performance of the chatbots via contextual augmentation, adding context and metadata, curating with questions and answers, etc. This will provide a competitive advantage and will attract a user base.

The regulatory landscape will further create a demand for solutions such as DataPond since explainable and transparent AI requires evidence-based references and efficient verification of data used by chatbots and agents to generate the results.

Do you have any links to share (GitHub, marketing page, demo video, etc.)?

Hi Jennifer,

Yes, I tried to include the links in the original forum post but I received a message that links are not allowed. Do you know if there is a way to include links?

Great! We currently run a survey to collect more information from DeAI projects building on ICP which will also inform our DeAI marketing website and campaign. Please provide as detailed information as possible here to increase your chances to get featured: https://t.co/igtmFHx73Q

Hi @domwoe,

I've been a forum member for over a year now and today I encountered an issue while trying to share a GitHub link. I received the following error message: "An error occurred: Sorry, you can't include links in your posts."

I've been able to share links without any issues until now. Could you please help me understand what the problem might be and how I can resolve it?

Thank you!

See here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/about-lack-of-safety-at-the-forum-and-the-factual-infestation-by-the-scammers-here/33148/28

It's an attempt to thwart scammers. @Ang we may need to tweak how aggressive the setting is

This is a great use case on ICP!

I checked the datapond-storage-canister and its functionality is relatively simple.
I implemented a more comprehensive decentralized file storage service ic-oss in Rust, and this project has also received a $25k Developer Grant.
Maybe ic-oss can bring more possibilities to your application. Welcome to use it!

Storing files on the Internet Computer and controlling their AI consumption is brilliant. The open-source toolbox for developers is a fantastic touch, and it's great to see a platform benefiting digital creators and businesses. Excited to see where this goes!
