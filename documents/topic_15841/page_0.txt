There is a feature of the NNS that I would like to open up for discussion, to gauge whether it merits a more detailed motion proposal.

In brief, at the moment the NNS actually goes to considerable lengths to avoid transfer of neuron ownership. The private key used to create a neuron is the only key that can control that neuron, creating issues of trust if one wishes to transfer the neuron to another owner.

The proposal I'm suggesting is:

- remove this restriction from the NNS and stop using it as a guiding principle for neuron ownership
- allow the controlling key of a neuron to be modified. In the simplest case, this would be a simple change from one key to another; in the more complex case we could support 1 or more keys, and optional multisig permissions, where at least N of those keys is required for specified operations
- if the key is changed, it would be best if the message to enact that change required a signature from both the old key and the new key, both to guard against typos and to ensure that the new key is valid

These changes should require only a bit of extra support in the NNS (more if multisig is adopted), and I anticipate it affecting the stakeholder community in at least these ways:

1. Neurons may be transferred to another key holder
2. Neurons may be controlled by a different device/key from the one used to create it
3. Neurons could be bought and sold on a secondary market
4. Neurons could be liquidated before the end of their dissolve delay
5. A person would be able to temporarily purchase voting power, which may mean that certain restrictions perhaps should be applied to a transferred neuron (for example, it cannot vote on proposals existing at time of transfer)

The main idea here is to monetize the "time risk" associated with a neuron, allowing market dynamics to assess that risk relative to the IC's health and future prospects. This could either help or hinder supply flows; more thought would be needed regarding the effect on tokenomics.

Where do you stand on this topic?  I can’t tell if you’re just trying to start the conversation or if you believe that neuron transfer should be allowed.  I value your opinion and therefore would like to know what you think.

DHemingway | 2022-10-11 00:17:47 UTC | #3

I was hoping this would happen - love the idea. If someone wanting to unstake their 8-year dissolve delay neuron early and “cash out” so to speak. This would allow a finance company to purchase the neuron at an agreed upon discount and the neuron would get reassigned to them. Who’s gonna set this up? :slight_smile: 

If the motion passes the right thing to do would be to set up a DAO to purchase neurons if people want an early exit, no sense in giving a finance/bank company more power. The DAO can arbitrage the purchase of ICP filled neurons for a discount, cents on the dollar. Ownership of the neurons go’s to the DAO, the community should own the DAO and we all profit from someone’s early exit from their neuron. 

Hope this makes sense. Maybe even have an option like we do for the community fund to opt into the DAO to purchase Neurons from identities that want out…

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-10-10 22:47:10 UTC | #4

Thanks for asking: I very strongly support transfer of neuron ownership. If disincentives are needed, that can come in the form of discounts against dissolve delay, for example; then the market should reflect whether trading neurons is positively or negatively correlated with price, rather than the choice that was made at genesis to disallow all transfers.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-10-10 23:12:37 UTC | #5

Do you have concerns that organizations with deep pockets will buy neurons at steep discounts and accumulate disproportionately high voting power?  Do you have concerns that this will drive the price of ICP down since token buyers who would otherwise be buying off exchanges will shift to buying neurons?  It seems there could be a lot of genesis neurons who would be willing to sell at a significant discount.  I would imagine you have given this a lot of thought and I'm curious how these kinds of arguments have affected your opinion on neuron transfer.

If neuron transfer were allowed, then do you have specific disincentives in mind that you think would be fair?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-10 23:18:29 UTC | #6

Now, would this mean that, say I staked a neuron on the NNS directly. However, I now would want to switch or transfer custody of it to say the nns app on my ledger nano s and store it there. I could? I personally have been crossing my finger for this exact case. However, I have been waiting for experts to weigh in on the vulnerabilities of making a neuron transferable. 

What would be (if any) new liabilities or issues that could arise with creating a transfer Neuron ownership such as this on a security level? I am 100% for this if it is safe. I think it would be an excellent way for average users to stake on the NNS and then be able to move said neuron once they've become more experienced and have a proper self-custody hardware wallet


EDIT: if selling staked neurons does at some point become a taboo issue or thrown down by consensus would you still consider drafting a proposal that would allow users to only transfer for described reasons I mention

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-10-10 23:20:05 UTC | #7

I think that an organization with deep pockets whose objective is voting power wouldn't need this mechanism, they would just buy ICP and stake it. The argument could be made that the ability to divest that neuron later makes it easier for such an organization to make that choice, since they wouldn't be locking themselves in, but I doubt this would determine their business model.

But here I will point to the "other blockchain" argument: Many other networks that support staking allow for easy entry and exit. I vote on Cardano, and can remove my stake at any moment without penalty. This has not ruined their viability as a voting platform nor been a noticeable factor in driving their price down (at least, no one points to it being such).

The disincentive I most prefer is that dissolve delay should correlate to discount, and that this should be set by the market. In other words, imagine a neuron trading site where buyers Would post bids of what they're willing to pay for X ICP at N dissolve delay, and sellers could decide which of those bids to accept. Since this correlates somewhat to "value at dissolution", I can imagine an options pricing model being applicable here, where price and volume volatility would contribute directly to those discounts.

As to who would build it: https://axon.ooo/ is already a great idea just waiting for more neuron control.

"Only transferring for specific reasons" is a very hard door to open, since the mechanism to determine those reasons must allow for full, decentralized automation.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-10 23:33:30 UTC | #9

point taken. Hmm. Well, I guess I'd support it, and hope that transferring for the reason I described comes along with it as an added bonus. I staked to avoid "weak hands", yet do often wish I could move off NNS directly. Just throwing it out there.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-10-10 23:39:03 UTC | #10

Yes, there are a lot of reasons to want to transfer keys, aside from early sale or purchase:

- Move onto or off of the NNS dApp
- Replace a compromised private key
- Split a neuron and distribute the parts to future heirs
- Move from a NitroHSM to a Ledger Nano (this affects many node providers)
- Key diversity if you decide you'd rather not keep everything in one big neuron

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-10 23:42:18 UTC | #11

Yes, yes,

 and more yes. Please create this proposal like yesterday. This is what I want, and have been waiting for. I do not care about the selling it would just be a bonus for those who do want to leave.

See previous discussions: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-remove-the-is-self-authenticating-restriction-on-neuron-ownership/14948

I personally think this breaks the NNS if it doesn’t impose a massive penalty. And if a market based penalty does emerge it becomes a variable that can get pretty out of whack and cause serious problems. The only thing that makes the NNS work is the demand that you “suffer” the consequences of your vote.

I disagree, buying lots of ICP influences the price directly and locked ICPs will likely cost less than liquid ones due to the risk associated with them.

Making neurons more liquid also means the deflationary effect provided by the NNS is reduced, cause if someone wants to buy VP he now has 2 options: buy tokens from the market or buy neurons at a discount.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-11 00:08:55 UTC | #15

Just a general question @Zane are you (we) talking about a possible equity issue? I just want to clarify in a language I better understand.

Can you say more about why this would be so, and why other projects have not needed this penalty?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-11 00:16:01 UTC | #17

Other projects don't have multipliers based on lockup periods afaik. The current system gives more VP on the premise value has been locked for a longer timeframe and the increased exposure to the ecosystem incentives better decision making, this becomes irrelevant if it becomes possible to sell the locked stake to someone else, cause at that point neuron's market becomes a greater fool type of economy.

If neuron transfer is here to stay and it seems it is no regardless of what the NNS officially decides, then it might be better to scrap the 8 year lockups altogether,  come up with a fixed APY for a lower timeframe and call it a day.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-11 00:16:40 UTC | #18

I'm sorry but I don't quite understand your question.

I see what you mean, yes, that could indeed be a counter-argument.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-11 00:22:32 UTC | #20

so, maybe it was not just to you but more general. My apologies. I am saying that if investors do sell out at a penalty or loss even and VPs buy them up would this not create further inequity in markets? Or would this not perhaps create an event where newer users may be taken advantage of when the market fluctuates as we see now?

Edit this could be what we are/ have mentioned tad slow sorry

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-10-11 00:31:39 UTC | #21

Most other staking mechanisms are objective and time bound(eth only requires you to be right when your number is drawn and the next validator is up in the next block) ours is subjective. Only after the the market has incorporated the effect of a voted on change should voters be released from their “skin in the game”.  If there are other “subjective” pos systems that allow instant withdraw they would make a great case study.  I haven’t gone down those deep holes so please feel free to point to some examples and I’ll take a look.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-10-11 00:34:48 UTC | #22

I discovered that to vote in Cardano, I did need the tokens to have been locked up for at least a couple of months. But I could take them out at any time (and not vote), or remove them just after voting.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2022-10-11 01:48:28 UTC | #23

I do not think this feature is necessary, if the purpose is to trade & transfer ownership of Neurons with large staked ICP (for institutional transaction), It can be done in OTC market with public notary agreement.

If you just want to monetize the "time risk" to trade associated neuron, but do not want to transfer ownership of the neurons (still keep the VP), this can be done in futures market exchange (an idea for developer the build), or..can use the 'betting' platform.

Do you know if this can be done for individuals who want to transfer it off NNS and onto Hardware? Or if the process could be streamlined to do so?

Yes, I aware of that, but it will just put more unnecessary burden to dfinity developers for developing features that are not urgently required, and it can still be done traditional way.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-10-11 03:15:30 UTC | #27

Hey @jwiegley,

I think in theory I *really* like this idea. I love the idea that one would be able to monetize their time risk in some alt-exchange for neurons. However, there is one primary concern (And several secondary concerns) I’d like to voice

**Potential Setbacks - 1**

* Using the current data from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/ , it appears the 24-hour average volume of our token is ~approximately 39M $. (To be honest, I’m not sure of the duration of look back they utilize)
* Combining the Staked: Not Dissolving & Staked: Dissolving data from the https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons , we have grand total of ~270 Million ICP that could potentially be exchanged if such a proposal is to pass
* For the sake of making this easy to understand – let’s assume 47% of those token holders are interested in exchanging neurons under such a proposal.
  * Staked Dissolving / Staked Not Dissolving = x
  * 86,526,459 / 183,076,549 = ~47%
* 86 million tokens at the currently residing market price of ~5.30 represents ~460 million dollars.
* The Current market cap of Internet Computer at the time of writing, according to https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/, is approximately 1.4 billion dollars
  * Staked Dissolving in $ / Total Market Capitalization = X
  * 460,000,000 / 1,400,000,000 = 33% of the entire value of ICP is now exchangeable
* Let us assume some of the whales in this pool have unknown reasons for wanting to hurt the tokens underlying price. Perhaps, their vested interest is now greater in another project. (On my honor – this is not a direct attack on you, nor your intentions. I’m merely trying to imagine the worst case.)
* Here is where I worry – those whales looking to hurt the token now can effectively control the liquidity of the underlying. Why is that?
* Their implied liquidity overhang from selling will be greater than that of the entire daily tradeable volume. I’m not sure why this worries me, but it is something that perks my whiskers… It makes me feel as though whales could effectively put gigantic orders under the residing bid price causing a reflexive effect in market makers who are likely "making" most of the order book on underlying exchanges. 
* Let’s make this easy. Let’s say some random participant, “Teri Dactyl”, has an 8-year neuron with 100 tokens for sale 9%. Let’s say another random market participant, “Ander Son”, is asking for 11% for their neuron.
* Now let’s imagine “Evil Whale” comes and posts up a 1Million token/8 yr. neuron order @ 7%. Evil whales only intentions are to hurt the market for whatever reason (We can extrapolate - This would represent ~$5,300,000 at the time of this writing, or nearly 13% of the total tradeable volume of native ICP traded on exchanges)
* “Ander Son” Freaks out and immediately asks for 9%, thus filling “Teri Dactyl’s” Order.
* Would this not cyclically manifest in similar circumstances for the rest of the market participants? Like a negative feedback loop of sorts.
* I guess this could theoretically work *in the opposite way*. This is still something I would be cautious of. Large whales could effectively price however they please, effectively *making* the market. The pricing would be skewed towards market participants who hold the most tokens and put their neurons for sale.

I don’t even know if this makes sense, or if this is how the derivatives market operates. I’m making several metric **** tons of assumptions here. Who knows what the market residing price would be. Perhaps the market prices based off Time Bound Risk, Reward rate outlay, Volatility risk, Inflation Risk, Growth runway, etc. Something kind of like “Greeks” in the option world? Any financial math wizzes out there?

I think I’ve heard derivatives exposure is a much greater proportion of implied liquidity than the underlying tradeable for some financial instruments. However, I’d imagine a massive proportion of this is bound up into basket-able securities and not direct underlying names. (Think perhaps a market capitalization weighted index vs. a Specific underlying name)

Could we protect ourselves from those who are looking to *spoof* orders to their advantage? Such a proposal would have to ensure only “Real” neurons could put neurons for sale. How often could they post? How would they be verified? What mechanism would need to be built to exchange neurons under such a proposal? Who would be the "Guarantor" of the transaction? There is no governing body that would be able to protect token holders from heinous or potentially illegal acts in these type of alt markets. (Guess this narrative could be applied to ANY tradeable crypto market... I Digress)

I must be transparent – for whatever reason, it *feels* like such a suggestion during a market puke is nefarious in nature John. It just seems a bit odd to bring this up now. You can surely reference several other posts you have made historically. But this looks like the first post you have made on the forum dedicated to this suggestion (I could be 100% lying here – I’ll go back and read through all your posts. If someone says otherwise, please don’t hesitate to correct me) However, I’d imagine you are a large stakeholder ICP regardless of your affiliations with other projects. You’ve poured your blood, sweat and tears into this project surely – and I take your word you want to see this project succeed.

Hope this makes sense. I could be completely off the deep end in my thought. Extremely grateful for what you have done for ICP and our community, John. You have always been a shining light in what feels like a heavily one-sided bureaucracy. Really just want to voice my opinion in the rawest form.

Imagine

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-10-11 03:41:18 UTC | #28

I also think or feel we should be mindful of whales or elitists taking advantage of poor market conditions or any global recession that could essentially further marginalize already marginalized and disenfranchised groups of individuals (such as those from low-income or poverty). Essentially, they could narrow the gap further by creating a further sense of fear in the space (through various media campaigns let’s say) just for the purpose of buying out these perhaps more financially strapped individuals at a significant hit and then jacking the price up shortly after accumulating as a way to monopolize

I appreciate the directness, @ImagineChadParadigm. I actually presented this idea on an internal Notion page at DFINITY several months before launch, so it has been on my mind for quite some time. The other day in the thread https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-protocol-rewards-thoughts/15692/3 someone brought up an idea for improving participation by changing rewards, and there I presented this idea of neuron trading as a way to (possibly) increase participation without touching rewards at all. Then I thought, why not, I'll present the proposal in a fuller form and solicit feedback to see what people's ideas are.

I am very much committed to the long-term success of our network, and have no desire to sell my 8 year neurons at a discount. What I would hope to see from this proposal is that an ability to trade money for time would shift the population of neuron holders from seed investors who may not have a great deal of interest in governance, to those willing to buy tranches of those neurons at a discount in order to increase their own voting power.

After 31 responses, although some were very much in favor of this proposal, it does not seem to have garnered enough support generally to merit putting forward as a proposal. DFINITY has expressed a desire for there to be no neuron markets, and so enormous support would be needed to ensure passage against their possible counter-vote.

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-05-06 18:40:37 UTC | #33

AFAIK, ICP neurons can't be controlled by canisters, and they can only be used as hotkeys to call basic methods such as top-up or changing the config of followed neurons. This should be changed, and the mere fear of the 'neurons market' seems unfounded to me, because anyone can sell their neurons anyway in the form of transferring the seed phrase of their II by the seller to the buyer.

It will be good to consider this proposal more one time and don't block implementing useful functions (ex. passive income as ICP neurons owned by SNS Treasury). Thanks for your attention.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-05-06 21:52:02 UTC | #34

I haven't read through this thread yet, but just wanted to throw out my current feeling on the topic: it probably doesn't matter too much if neurons can be transferred. I feel this way because of the extreme difficulty or implausibility of enforcing the restriction, and the fact that other staking networks don't rely on this kind of mechanism (Ethereum being the largest and most successful) and they seem to be functioning just fine.

Those are my most basic feelings on the topic from thinking about it at a surface level over the past couple years, a deeper dive might change my opinion, but I don't care too much to go deeper. Fighting this seems like a lot of effort to achieve a mythical security property that in reality could be impossible to achieve or not really necessary.

>This should be changed, and the mere fear of the ‘neurons market’ seems unfounded to me, because anyone can sell their neurons anyway in the form of transferring the seed phrase of their II by the seller to the buyer.

There is clearly intent for them to be locked.  The fact that there is a way around it is not a good excuse to let it continue to happen. There are other mechanisms that are or will become possible.  Once we have a good mechanism to restrict transfers it increases network security to enact it.

>(Ethereum being the largest and most successful) and they seem to be functioning just fine.

I think this comparing apples to oranges.  ETH staking and any consequences of decisions made by stakers are closed out at the end of each epoch. The NNS is voting on things that won't be 'closed out' for years.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-05-06 22:41:40 UTC | #36

Are you talking about governance proposals or a trial IC protocol votes?

In the case of governance proposals those don't have any real affect just from a vote passing, this security risk is low.

In the case of protocol votes, those are much more akin to validator votes. I see them as very similar in the potential negative consequences of voting. You could take down Ethereum with a large percentage of staking power just like you could with ICP (voting on the protocol, not governance proposals).

[/quote]

Named neurons vote on governance motion proposals.  Governance motion proposals do not change code.  Only DFINITY is capable of implementing changes approved by a governance motion proposal and it happens in a follow up proposal that is not a governance motion proposal.  All neurons were set by default to follow DFINITY on the All Topics catch all category.  Hence, when DFINITY votes on the types of proposals that do change code they trigger a total of 99.4% voting power in the NNS (of which DfINITY owns 23% directly).  There are many layers of protection to the network.  There is zero risk to the network caused by named neurons.  Control of the votes resides 100% in the hands of the people who own the private keys to the neurons.  Hence, there have historically been features that make it hard to transfer neuron ownership at a discount.  DFINITY chose to restrict neuron transfer by way of code limitations, so if that is going to change then I want to hear DFINITY describe what has changed and why it is no longer considered a risk.  I also think all neurons should be treated equally in terms of ownership transfer limitations.  Hence, it doesn’t seem appropriate for a different set of rules to apply to genesis neurons and post genesis neurons.

[quote="kyliux, post:37, topic:15841"]

Offline neuron transfer means the individuals have to trust each other.  I think a lot less people are willing to do that than they would be with an online service.  An online service that helps interested parties find each other and provides an escrow service for the neuron ownership transfer is a totally different scenario than it happening between private parties who have to find each other and trust each other.  The fact that offline neuron transfer is possible is no justification for an online marketplace.

@lastmjs Agreed that governance proposals do not change code and are low risk.  However, neuron transfer at a discount is a transfer of voting power for all proposal topics, not just governance motion proposals.

When ICP were created ( supposedly equal right ? ) how do you explain that Genesis neuron, on day 1 had already their 25% Bonus reward ? Is that the inequality you want to fight ? So they get back to 0 ? Let me tell you, they are NOT equal, not for this reason and not for the price people payed to get them.

Oh wait, It could be that you are in FAVOR of trading neurons online with this equality argument, since rich people can use institutions to sell them ( offline ) while small retail neurons will never get the opportunity to do this. I love your arguments i have to admit.

Named neurons could be made with 1 ICP stacked and ( could ) have more than half follower. So basically they do not have skin in the game and can influence everything. If you would have read the previously given link, you could see that in contrary, when you buy/sell neuron on a second market, you have to pay a good price for it and so by definition you have a skin in the game and want the best interest for ICP.

Lastly, lets look at the stats, IDgeek have been here for what, 10 days and it traded less than 0.002% of the total supply of ICP. Or also less than 1% of monthly unlocked neurons from genesis. Perhaps you should fight to prevent neurons to get unlocked.

All best xx

I don't follow your questions or purpose, but I will correct some facts and clarify my point as requested.  All neurons, genesis and post genesis, had voting rewards that were in the ballpark of 40% APY (8YG) on day one.  Genesis neurons were pre-aged with 18 months, so they did have a slightly high bias compared to post-genesis neurons, but that certainly doesn't amount to 25% higher than post-genesis neurons.  Nonetheless, it was all spelled out in the tokenomics literature and everyone had access to that information.  All neurons have been subject to the same rules from day one and my original point is that I believe that should remain in effect.  I don't care if it's a genesis neuron, a post genesis neuron, a small neuron, or a whale neuron, they should all be subject to the same rules.  If neuron markets are going to exist, then they should be accessible to all neurons, not just neurons created with an internet identity.  If neuron markets are going to be mitigated, then all neuron markets in all forms should be mitigated when they become known.  My position on neuron transfer and neuron markets will be heavily informed by the position that DFINITY expresses on this topic because I believe it is fundamental to ICP tokenomics.  If there is a change in philosophy on this topic, then I expect it will come after careful study by experts in the field.  I want to hear what they have to say.

This is a fallacy in my opinion.  Almost all named neurons are actively involve in governance and they all have skin in the game.  Owners of named neurons do not publicize their personal neurons.  Most of them create voting neurons that are separate from their personal neurons for privacy reasons.  Regardless, who really has the right to decide how much skin in the game is enough?  It makes no difference how much stake is in a named neuron.  What matters is if they are trusted by followers.  Even if they are trusted on routine proposals, there is nothing stopping neuron owners from voting manually on any proposal any time.  There is also nothing stopping neuron owners from changing their Followee to any other neuron any time for any reason.  And then there is the not so obvious fact yet again that governance motion proposals do not change code.  I am an active contributor on Taggr and I am well aware of the post that you linked, but quite frankly I'm tired of contributing to the same discussion over and over again, sometimes with the same people, when nothing new is introduced.  I fundamentally disagree with the idea that named neurons are a security threat to ICP.

Thanks for your explanation ( nice dodge too ),

Tbh I do not think neither that they are a big risk. But I think its still higher than an online market. :slight_smile:

skilesare | 2023-05-07 20:33:05 UTC | #42

You hit on an essential distinction. I think that the cumulative effect of the governance votes will dictate a lot about future value of the network.

I see the fundamental security assumption of the NNS being "a voter's stake must remain at stake until the the effect has been endured by the system and incorporated by the market."

This is super short for things like exchange rate votes. It could be super long for things like admiting new data centers whose inclusion can flip from beneficial to the network to malicious for the network long into the future.(say a change in ownership of the data center leads to a malicious owner publishing internal canister state).

We can't do this 1:1 in reality, so we use a time bound abstraction over it and try to make the effect match the reward we pay in order to maximize the long term thinking of the network.

The NNS does have some say over things that are fundament different than other networks. We are paying people to make right predictions about the future, not fact based consensus where we have full,deterministic knowledge.

This whole system may not be a good idea, but it is currently the one we are running with and it seems that most just want to slap a incorrect label and set of assumptions on it and degen forward. 🤷‍♂️

I think it’s been a long time since we’ve heard an official position statement from DFINITY on neuron markets. It would be helpful if DFINITY would reaffirm previous positions or officially announce new positions. I know John isn’t with DFINITY any more, so perhaps @bjoernek or @diegop could indicate if we are likely to get additional, formal feedback from DFINITY on this topic.
[/quote]

@wpb As recently shared in this [forum thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-idgeek-identity-anchor-marketplace/19628/8) on the transfer of Internet identity anchors
* DFINITY still has concerns on neuron markets for security reasons. In particular, we believe that it should be difficult to transfer neurons in order to ensure that neurons have skin in the game and thus vote in the long-term interest of the IC.
* The team is still exploring ideas on how to make it more difficult to transfer neurons (or provide additional incentives to neurons which are not transferable).

They can of course also vote on other proposals too.

Isn’t the whole point of named neurons to drive decentralization?  And isn’t it necessary for them to vote on code changes independent of Dfinity to achieve this?


[quote="wpb, post:38, topic:15841"]
There is zero risk to the network caused by named neurons.
[/quote]

The point I was making in my post is that if you think buying/selling of neurons is a risk to the protocol due to lack of ‘skin in the game’ then you have to apply that logic to named neurons as well which have much less skin in the game compared to the VP they control.

So the question is, if you think there’s no risk from named neurons even though they can control a disproportionate amount of VP compared to their personal stake, why do you think it’s a security risk if people buy neurons at a discount?

Beautiful remarks, for the sake of network security and stability we would need to give all neuron holder the same *benefits level* and influence. Lets change the value of all account that have proven to be managed by distinct human, the same amount of token.

@wpb and [bjoernek](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/bjoernek) here for security right ? How can you PREVENT that the HUGE VC whales of this network will just sell in a disinterested manner to bad actors and gtfo without caring about the long term growth of the network ?

No, instead, you guys are focusing on making life hard for ppl that lost most of their money/ are more requiring the IC succeed further while those ppl are in the same time the one that have the LEAST INFLUENCE.

How can you defend this type of position ?

That can't be prevented. But if they want to sell (and therefore dissolve their neurons), they can't vote on proposals that could cause long-term damage to the network

-------------------------

kyliux | 2023-05-08 12:46:28 UTC | #48

If I understand well, the scenario you are afraid of is the following : 

1. Big enough accounts 
2. wanting to sell their ICP just after influencing a critical decision that will 
3. destroy the network
4. To people willing to buy for it
5. Those should be also rich enough

Those 5 points needs to be met **together** to raise any security concern from the existence of a neuron market

1. Arent we decentralised ? And becoming more and more decentralised over time ?
2. Because if they do not want to sell, the market have no influence 
3. I guess thats not possible, but they can arm it buy making network forgetting ckbtc keys
4. Someone want to buy when the network is at risk ? LOL
5. Will the day someone can buy a tens of half of the supply ever exist ? LOL

We can simplify the previous 5 concerns with the following population : 

Basically you are just effraid that 

1. **VC**  2. vote for **bad** decisions and 3. people **buy** their neurons

Since the demand is so low in ICP we dont even need to prevent VC from selling, they have already difficulty selling with gains XD

I really dont see where anyone can find any concern, and in long term this will reduce with the decentralisation of the network.

There is something clear to keep in mind. Identity on the internet is precisely to uniquely identify the person. Corrupting this basic is detrimental to IC. :x: :x: :x:

Another example of yours, do you see that gmail officially offers address sales? They are definitely not interested in that market.

You can sell your seed phrase if you want, but it seems wrong to me that dfinity generates tools to enlarge that market.

It seems to me flatly harmful to offer tools to exchange neurons. In every way it is detrimental.

Let's keep moving forward and don't go backwards in this that doesn't make sense..

Why not add a vote in the forum? to see if you agree that dfinity spends resources to expand a market that no one needs? 
[poll type=regular results=always chartType=pie]
# Proposal: Permit transfer of neuron ownership
* In favor of spending resources to enlarge the neuron market..

Just to be clear you could have phrased this simply yes or no for neuron marketplace. Some might reed into it that if spending is done by others and not Dfinity it could be ok.

You're right but they already did it... outside of dfinity. The key is to try not to enlarge what they did.

Yes I am aware of NFTgeek and IDgeek. Bunch of useless Anchors with 0 value and few days old probably listed by them as it was discussed to experiment and also if I am not mistaken Manu said that it is only for Anchors created with Internet Identity Frontend and that is just a tiny fraction.

Well well It seems that there are some misconceptions here.

Uniquely identify a person ? People can have many internet identity so its certainly not unique.

About your vote, I am also not sure to understand, you are then in favor of the market right ? Since dfinity people have nothing to do with it ( exept that some want to make it hard for some people to trade their neurons )

That each IC identity identifies only one person does not contradict the fact that a person can have multiple identities. The relationship is 1 to N, not 1 to 1.

The problem comes when you buy and sell identities, the essence of the identity is lost and it becomes a token that goes and comes from person to person... that's the problem... one can have several emails that identify you, but the same email does not It goes from person to person buying and selling.

One IC identity = one account.

Your extension for a person comes from thin air. Many keys can log to the same account, and I can share my keys the same way as I can share my email or google services.

Great, those who want to share, sell, give away their identity and their neurons that share the seed phrase. Solved this issue, nothing needs to be done.

Or maybe DFINITY skeptical about this idea of neuron transfer due to panic fear of the 'neuron market' will at least allow their transfer if they have a 'dissolved' status? This would be a nice compromise, and at the same time a step forward and the beginning of further movement in this topic.
Perhaps someday, like NNS DAO, we will decide to abolish the dissolve delay and the problem will solve itself?

-------------------------

doo | 2023-05-14 04:59:02 UTC | #58

Neuron transferable and ii account trading feels unnecessary, if a project is issued to escrow ii account after minting new tokens, new tokens and icp do liquidity ... and escrow ii account for dissolution, dissolution is completed in the market to buy back the minted tokens for destruction ... can also serve as a good exit mechanism, if the price of the tokens for the market panic situation will become lower, and then slowly recover to a certain tiny difference

**If neuron owners wish to transfer ownership of their locked ICP could they not be added to a pool where they are burned in the purchase of cycles and therefore control inflation.**

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-07-06 17:19:48 UTC | #60

In many cases I see long term participants with much learned knowledge and experience burnout, pressure in life or have other interests, decide they want to move on which is a great loss to a project and then you have new interests come in that don’t have that history and experience that start the old arguments again.

Neuron owners may need a break and be able to have a break while keeping good relations so they can and would want to return at a later date.

We need to find a way to reduce the overhead and streamline voting and ownership of their neurons that cause the least friction to the owners and the project.

The IC creates neurons for cycles but instead it could burn old ICP instead so that there would be no need for outsiders to take advantage for profits as the pool could repay funds that have been earned for their participation and goodwill and not be punished.

If the pressure is off a neuron owner that they know they can sell all or part of their investment then they have options but as a 8 year neuron I have to wait for a longtime.

Also there needs to be an incentive for neuron owners to think twice about transferring their ICP from their neurons by seeing value added to the price of an ICP. Personally I see that any coin that has a circulating supply too high the value is much lower where by putting a max supply seems to give higher value.

-------------------------

kvic | 2023-07-06 18:43:04 UTC | #61

If an ICP coin grows in value then participating should give a good reason for a neuron owner to join in discussions and also be aware of the changes and the other opportunities that they can also participate in like the SNS. 

As we live in different time zones it makes it harder to vote when we are at rest.

If each proposal has 1 vote awarded to each neuron to vote on then those who don’t vote lose rewards and therefore no need for a followers list.

If a neuron that has had no activity for a period of time then could be flagged as dead for some other process to take over. 

Taking away or making it harder for a third party to dominate or take control of the IC I feel would be achieved while incentivizing neuron owners to participate and they not only get rewards for each ICP in that neuron but the value of the ICP is also a reward as it grows in value.

I feel that this makes a neuron a private wallet that gives the owner control and safe guards their investment from the problems seen with exchanges which could increase investment to then loan ICP from neurons for the SNS and mitigate risk for the SNS of lack of funds and participate in projects of the choice for further rewards.
