On the `ic` network, when I execute a function which (among other things) calls the constructor of an actor class, I get the error:

> The Replica returned an error: code 4, message: "Creating a canister requires a fee of 100000000000 that is deducted from the canister's initial balance but only 0 cycles were received with the create_canister request."

This, of course, does **not** happen when I test the code locally.
Should I put `Cycles.add(100000000000)` before calling the constructor? (it's not done in the docs on *actor class*es)

Thanks,

**EDIT:** Solved below

`Cycles.add()` is in fact needed, but the amount of cycles to transfer is more than 100000000000. An insufficient amount can trigger somewhat obscure errors like:

> The Replica returned an error: code 4, message: "IC0503: Canister ... trapped explicitly: could not perform call"
