I'm trying to upgrade dfx from 0.9.3 to 0.10.0, and I'm getting the following error:

```
> dfx upgrade
Current version: 0.9.3

Error: Invalid data: unable to gunzip file: Unexpected GZIP ID: value=[60, 63], expected=[31, 139]
```

`dfx upgrade` is broken at the moment. There is a workaround wish I not tested posted there ðŸ‘‰ https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-0-10-0-is-promoted/12870/3?u=peterparker
