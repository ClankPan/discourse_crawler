Is there a benefit of storing timestamps as a [Time](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/time) type instead of a [Nat](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/base-libraries/Nat.html) type with millisecond precision of the Timestamp or an [ISO string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) of the [Text](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/text) type?
