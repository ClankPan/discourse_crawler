Hello all,

What is the best practice for managing multiple deployments of one canister on a single network?

Historically what I have done is to create several "networks" in the dfx.json networks section but that actually all point to the same network (local dfx server or mainnet) but I guess this isn't a good idea long term.

At one stage I had several different checkouts of the same repo, so each had its own canister_ids.json, which worked but was very cumbersome.

How do you do it?

The best thing we have is the multiple networks that point to the same thing (we call it [staging network](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/deploy/staging-environment) in the docs). With 0.12.0 of dfx with the system-wide replica this will be a lot less cumbersome because you can describe the multiple networks in one place and access them from everywhere, but the base problem will still be the same.
