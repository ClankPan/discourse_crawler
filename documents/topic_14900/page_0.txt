Can we remove them is there a proposal we can do to remove a named neuron? They are not functioning anymore and their existence is misleading people.

-------------------------

nlh | 2022-08-16 11:53:18 UTC | #2

Hi cryptoisgood. Just to clarify: does it mean that the cycledao neuron has been discontinued and I should not follow it if I want to?
Thank you.

Cycle DAO wrote a post recently outlining that it will no longer be a managed neuron, and they set their following to ICP Maximalist Network.

It would be better / cleaner for the NNS to remove those following Cycle DAO since it is now effectively defunct

The question is, what happens to all of Cycle DAO's followees? Does it get reset or does it automatically get applied to ICP Maximalist Network?

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-16 13:15:50 UTC | #4

Hi all, 
I am a researcher in the NNS team.

Currently there is no proposal to remove known neurons. As this came up multiple times already I think it makes sense to suggest to add this to our backlog. Since the team is working on the final stretches for SNS and there are other governance feature requests, I guess we might not get around to do that right away.

> The question is, what happens to all of Cycle DAO’s followees? Does it get reset or does it automatically get applied to ICP Maximalist Network?

That is an interesting question. When adding the removal of known neurons we would have to design what we mean by this in detail. 
Intuitively, I would say that a known neuron is different from other neurons only in that it can be listed as a known neuron and thus also be displayed on frontends etc. With this interpretation "removing" a known neuron would probably just mean that we remove it from the list, but that the neuron would still exist. If we don't define anything else, this would mean that current followers of this neuron would still follow it even thought the neuron is not known anymore (as one can always also follow a neuron that is not known).

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-08-16 14:00:00 UTC | #5

I think simply removing a known neuron from the list (without changing the follower relationships) would be sufficient.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-08-16 17:23:02 UTC | #6

I agree with this - giving the NNS the ability to clear a specific neuron’s followees could be used to attack specific “minority” named neurons that the majority disagrees with and disrupt the balance of voting power on certain issues. It could also be used to temporarily boost voting rewards and reintroduce financial spam incentives into the system.

Therefore, simply removing the named neuron from the frontend UX should be sufficient.

@lara I would imagine a change like this would be a trivial frontend fix.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-08-17 10:15:55 UTC | #7

+1 to just removing it from the list, I really don't think we should be changing neuron following relations.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-17 11:43:39 UTC | #9

Should we make a proposal to add it to back log or can you just do it?

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-08-17 23:01:57 UTC | #10

I think this code change would need to come from a proposal that the community agrees on. 

Maybe you can even get @Arthur Falls to fund it.

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-18 18:52:14 UTC | #11

I added it as a todo to the list of todos for the NNS team, so no further actions are needed to get it there. I think most people think this is a good idea.
Note that this does not mean that we will get around to this right away.
After finalising the SNS we will have to prioritise the different governance todos..

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-18 18:58:16 UTC | #12

Actually, the known neurons are stored in the NNS governance canister and the frontend pulls this list from the governance. This also allows others, including for example other frontends, to get the list.

A neuron can be added to the list by a proposal that, on adoption, adds a neuron to this list.
Note that this decision is automatically executed on chain and does not require manually adding the known neuron.
If we want to implement the removal of neurons, the required change is a new proposal in the NNS governance canister that, on adoption, removes a given neuron from the list.
Conversely, no frontend changes are required as the frontend just pulls the list.

Awesome, thanks for the correction @lara. I understand that you don't want to context switch, but offf the top of your head do you have any idea how much work this (removal of a named neuron via an NNS proposal) would take to complete? 

It might even be something (in terms of the governance canister change and proposal) that's a light enough lift that the community could take on if you point us in the right direction.

-------------------------

Arthur | 2022-08-18 19:14:34 UTC | #14

On this point. Let's just rename the to "Arthur's Neuron". I'm heavily involved in governance behind the scenes and have a large number of relationships with large holders who trust me in the named neuron role. Keeping the named neuron active will make it easier for me to onboard more investors when I begin activating them again. It also means we don't lose follow options.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-08-18 23:51:26 UTC | #15

What happens if there is a second proposal to adopt a named neuron with a different name? I may try to look at the code later, but not at my computer . It should be in the governance section of the NNS code. (Great chance to poke around if you’ve never read the code.)

I wanted to add here that, while this is now on the team's backlog, it might of course still be valuable to already make a motion proposal and ensure that the broader community is also in favour of this. 
I don't expect that people will be against this change, but if we want to follow normal patterns it might still be nice not to take the consent for granted? 

Of course we can also do this later and, in any case, the community can also vote on the proposal that actually upgrades the governance canister with this change.

But I previously just answered the question in the sense of "we, the NNS team are now aware of this request" and wanted to clarify that additional communication might still be warranted for the larger community!

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-19 14:05:33 UTC | #18

Let me divide the "how much work"-question into two sub-questions:

1. What are the **required changes** (from the top of my head)?
  a. Write a method that accesses the list of known neurons in the governance state and removes the given known neuron.
b. Make sure this method can only be called by the governance canister
c. Define a new proposal that calls this method. Consider what the properties of this new proposal should be (its type, topic, reward weight, etc). Add proposal verification etc. 
d. tests, code reviews
e. Integration with the NNS frontend (is the new proposal type displayed correctly? Is the list of known neurons updated correctly?)
f. security review
g. Build the new governance wasm and test the upgrade in an environment that is as close to the production NNS as possible 

2. How **long** would it take? (Again, these are just some rough guesstimates from the top of my head)
a.-e. I would say a few days for an NNS engineer, probably considerably longer for another engineer (as one has to find the relevant places in the code etc)
f. a few hours, but some overhead as this includes another team
g. another few hours for an NNS engineer. This relies on the right setup, so I think this would be a lot of effort for outsiders.

Regarding the question if this is something that could be done by the community, I don't think I am the right person to answer this and I recommend that this is discussed in a more general conversation with others.
Some things that come to my mind:
* We would then maybe first have to discuss how community contributions would best be organized in terms of tooling etc
* We might want to discuss how we could slowly ramp up community contributions:
   * Maybe there are some parts of the code that are better suited to start with this and we could start there and widen the range. I personally think that it might make sense to start with a less security-critical canister than governance (note that if we break the governance canister, upgrades are not possible anymore and so recovery becomes very hard). 
   * Maybe there are some tasks that are better suited to start with: As you see above, there are different parts to realising a feature. Maybe it makes sense that for some features the community contributes parts, but DFINITY still leads other parts (e.g., security reviews / the testing of the upgrades). 
   * It might make sense to put this in perspective with other goals. Would it, for example, be more important for decentralization that more entities are able to *verify* proposals rather than contributing to changes themselves? Since community members cannot do everything, it might also make sense to discuss where to start here!

These are just some thoughts.. As stated, I think this would require a more general conversation with other people :) But I hope it was helpful that I shared some details about what tasks are included in this concrete example feature

I just want to make sure that we consider this point by @Arthur (the person who controls the cycle_dao neuron).

if it' renamed to "Arthur's neuron," do we need to do anything? 

(I agree that it would be good to have the functionality for removing, but in this case, I think maybe a governance proposal to *rename* the neuron may be more helpful).

what do folks think @lara @cryptoisgood @skilesare @Arthur @justmythoughts @Manu ?

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-19 14:30:49 UTC | #20

from my point of view it would still make sense to have the functionality, but maybe if we don't need it right now this just means that the feature is a bit less urgent?

Regarding having renaming instead of removing, I would say that removing is preferable: If we have adding and removing, I think a given neuron could be renamed by a proposal to remove it and another proposal to add it again (with a new name). The converse is not true: if we add just renaming, we still cannot remove neurons.
Also, I would expect that in the long term we would want to remove some neurons.
But happy to discuss!

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-08-19 14:46:15 UTC | #21

@lara In simpler terms, this is what I was thinking as a process:

**1. Add renaming functionality in short term**
        * Once it is done, submit NNS proposal to rename
        * This keeps following relationships and neuron history and community

**2. Add removing functionality after #1**
       * To be used in future cases

It seems you suggested we do #2 before #1 because we have to do that anyways. Did i understand correctly?

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-19 14:57:29 UTC | #22

I think renaming the neuron might confuse and scare a lot of people. I can already see the posts; “my neuron suddenly started following some guy Arthur, have I been hacked??!?”. Then you explain your renamed it and it all becomes a problem.

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-19 14:57:40 UTC | #23

Almost. I propose to do #2 and never do #1 as this is roughly the same effort but covers more functionality.
Let me try to express this in the same style.. 

**Add removing functionality**
* Once it is done, submit NNS proposal to remove Cycle DAO. Let's assume the Cycle DAO neuron has neuronID *12345* 
* This keeps following relationships and neuron history and community. That is, neuron *12345* still exists, everyone that followed it will still follow it. The only difference is that neuron *12345* will not be displayed in the FE list of known neurons.
* submit NNS proposal to add neuron *12345* with the name "Arthur". Everyone that followed CycleDao will now follow Arthur. Arthur is shown as the name of neuron *12345* in the frontend.

If I now follow CycleDao it might be that there is a brief moment between the second and third point where I would see my neurons follow *12345* because the neuron has no name.

-------------------------

lara | 2022-08-19 15:00:37 UTC | #24

Depending on how things are implemented this might also happen in my suggestion where one could remove a neuron and add it again with another name.. But I think this is something that would have to be clarified with the frontend team (I would have to double check how a neuron's name is relevant when you already follow it). 

But we seem to agree that a removing proposal might be favourable over a rename proposal.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-19 15:10:51 UTC | #25

This is probably way more code but maybe we should remove neuron and next time they login prompt them. “Hey a neuron has been removed because reasons so you have to pick a new neuron to follow. “

Deleting the list of oligarchs is the correct choice. Why do neurons in an oligopoly list get voting power more easily than others? Why oligarchic lists can manipulate voting to achieve self-censorship.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-19 15:19:02 UTC | #27

Because passive staking is important for the growth of the protocol

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-08-19 15:42:23 UTC | #29

@dfinity You design rules where you have to vote to get rewards, then send hundreds of daily maintenance proposals every day. You also say that the focus on oligarchs is because users trust public nerves. Do users have other options besides following you? Can you vote on dozens of subnet upgrade proposals and 144 exchange rate proposals every day? Do users have other options than following oligarchic lists? The same goes for the motion proposal, DFINITY puts public neurons in front of NNS, they get votes more easily than others, they just form an interest group that can self-censor. If IC is a public blockchain, it should belong to all stakers. Is the oligarch list fair to the voting rights of other stakers? Is this how you treat the voting rights of other stakers?（I don't know exactly who designed it, so tag dfinity here）

A NNS Frontend dapp user can follow ANY neuron. For example, Manu Drijver's neuron is on his Twitter profile: `8191637969740243463`. Some neurons follow neurons that are not "named". "Named neuron" is just for the the list in the UX, but you can input any neuron to follow

Being a named neurons is just a neuron having a name.

My experience of people not being aware they can input any neuron ID is honestly an *UX/design issue* to make it more obvious for users in the dapp. I am not sure it is a consequence of the list, but I am willing to concede I am missing some nuance you are getting at.

I believe you mean: 

*"An uninformed user may only select from the list of named neurons"*

(again, i don't see how a named neuron is an oligarch)

But I think I agree with you since by definition you are saying: "Users unaware of feature X are NOT using feature X."

Thats very reasonable. 

What is unknown is how many people are unaware of X feature or how many would change their behavior. Not sure, but I am definitely a believer in making the design more obvious based on personal anecdotes.

The intent is simple and borne from just "*Be helpful. Make it easy for folks*" by giving people some options.The first options were DFINITY and ICA (at Genesis) since its a new network, but the proposal and UX more was added.

The rationale is to help people (again, UX/Design)... but still allow power users who want to input their own neuron IDs.

https://gist.github.com/skilesare/7af5883f63a340d20a3f52ebb22b493b

-------------------------

Hey @Arthur.  I would be willing to submit this proposal for you.  If you will post the new neuron name along with the description you want to use, then I can submit it any time you are ready.  I was wondering if this is something you would prefer, so I'm glad you have commented and others have already answered the question to confirm it is possible to rename the neuron by just submitting another RegisterKnownNeuron proposal.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-19 17:45:15 UTC | #58

To me this is just another reason why we should all expect people to actively participate in governance.  Yes, questions will come up, but community leaders can choose to snuff the fire instead of fanning the flames.  We all have a role in educating people.  People need to know how named neurons are created as well as who and why they are following them.  This kind of change is just a label change that has no immediate impact on voting maps or voting rewards.  Yet it seems like a perfect opportunity to shock people into realizing that tokenomics are intended to motivate people to pay attention to ICP governance.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-19 17:50:05 UTC | #59

You’re assuming we have access to everyone that uses the nns. Lots of people don’t go to dfinity forums, don’t go to Twitter. All they know is the nns, how are these people supposed to be educated ?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-19 18:08:40 UTC | #60

The same way that the rest of us are educated...

It would also be nice if DFINITY created a Latest Developments in Governance section on their web page or in the NNS dApp.  I am working on a website to support IC governance and I do plan to include a one stop location to find all the latest information on how to maximize voting rewards.  This kind of change would be included.

[/quote]
@Arthur can always rename the neuron (using a Register Known Neuron proposal) twice to avoid this. The first time, he can rename the neuron to something like "Arthur Falls (formerly cycledao.xyz)", and he can explain the change of name in the Register Known Neuron description field. For context, this is the current description:

> cycle_dao is a group of Internet Computer ecosystem members who deliberate on proposals and vote via a DAO that controls the cycle_dao neuron. We aim to weigh the interests of all parties in the Internet Computer ecosystem and support the future stability and longevity of the Internet Computer.

So the new description can explain the name change. This description isn't currently displayed in the NNS front-end dapp or IC dashboard, but that can be added.

Then when a reasonable amount of time has passed and followers have had time to notice the change, optionally rename the known neuron a second time to remove the "(formerly cycledao.xyz)" text.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-19 18:21:16 UTC | #62

Haha.  I've been wanting to suggest @ysyms create his own named neuron for a long time, but haven't been able to figure out the right way to do it because 1) it's antithetical to his primary message about "oligarchs" and 2) he's the guy responsible for all that spam and I'd probably get a lot of FUD for suggesting it (especially if he became a named neuron when the list was short).  The reality is that @ysyms changed the conversation about governance and motivated a lot of participation, so I see no reason why he shouldn't be a named neuron.  He has a political position in this ecosystem and I would support him pursuing it...even if he is only a high school kid. :crazy_face:

Right. That is the interest of each one. But an an interest group is tied and collaborates to move their shared interest. I think the goals and decision making of these named neurons (and more to come) is different. At face value, it is not bad for entities to have interests. In fact, it's nornal. Decentralized networks are composed of many entities with interests. Its possible there is some nuance I am missing so I appreciate any patience.

I do not think it is appropriate to keep calling named neurons the "oligarch's list" since anyone can join. I honestly think this dialogue may benefit from more neutral words such as "named neurons" (what they are). That being said, folks behind the *named neurons* do tell people what their votes will be on their own tweets or on the forum or other social media presences. It is the  burden of the leader to convince people in whatever way makes most sense. Did I understand your intent?

I mean why naming neurons isn't just advertised on its own social media

I believe they do advertise on multiple places. Its possible you just missed it, but I am 90% certain I have seen some folks tweet about it.

Adding a neuron to the UI of the NNS Frontend dapp is not that much different from how ALL updates (UI or backend) are done to the NNS Frontend Dapp happen: they are all done via proposals that community votes on. I can see why it may make sense to change it, but its not that crazy where it is currently at. This because the NNS FE dapp is a tokenized dapp updated via proposals and  voting. **All changes to the backend or frontend of NNS FE dapp are done via proposals.**

In order to avoid permanent impact on IC, I agree to delete/hide past test spam proposals and criticism of IC after a thorough fix of spam proposal motivation

I am a non-native English speaker myself so I can imagine there may be some intent or nuance lost across communication. I am always willing to engage and try to work together. It is always possible i am misunderstanding you and that is my fault.

Wanted to leave a thought here:

Is **get_neuron_ids** implemented in the governance canister yet? Or are there plans to do this? It doesn't seem to return anything when I check [here](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai).

If the governance canister returned a list of neuron ids, a third party dapp developer could build a neuron naming service outside of the NNS. This could potentially eliminate the need for named neuron proposals and would allow another dedicated team to build a social media style dapp for the dedicated purpose of advertising, etc.

@diegop @wpb I guess a larger question I have is - if everyone is just making named neuron proposals that WILL pass, why can’t we just name our neuron directly in the NNS Dapp UI?

Maybe make people pay a 1-5 ICP cost to do so and save the voters the time.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-08-19 23:23:48 UTC | #74

[Motion Proposal for NNS Neuron ID Indexing](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491) has not been implemented.

The `get_neuron_ids` method you mentioned is something different. It's used to get the neuron IDs of the caller of the method.

This is worth teasing apart so I can share my thoughts on this accurately to answer your question:

1. The design intent is that the community chooses all named neurons. They are not meant to all pass. The intent is community could reject for some (for whatever reason). The design intent is NOT that they all pass “but with extra steps.”

2. I do not work on the NNS FE dapp, so i do NOT know a lot of the design intent. That being said, on the surface, I think yours is a perfectly reasonable suggestion (assuming there is a UI that is good enough to handle that and not a mess). I would certainly support it based on what I currently know (possible something I do not of course).

I’ve tweeted and have our neuron on our site as well as having submitted a named neuron. If I’m an oligarch I want a hockey rink in my backyard.

Hahaha、 when NNS is the government of the world you'll have dozens of ice skating rinks

@ysyms 
Welcome to the Oligarchy.  :crown:

I will vote to approve your register known neuron [proposal 76313](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/76313).  I hope it passes.

However, I wouldn't want you to try to hide/delete your spam and advertisement proposals in the future.  It's part of the public record and history.  I don't think proposal history should ever be deleted.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-08-20 00:16:10 UTC | #80

Why can't it be hidden if both the originator and the NNS agree

I mean... we trust high school aged kids to put their life on the line in the military. :slight_smile: 

It will be up to the followers to decide who they want to follow. I'm all for it Ysyms.

Perhaps it's simply so the governing body has a chance to say no.

My full time job and 11 year old car is also very anti oligarch. Do the benefits start later?

If we make it easy to add neuron we also need to make it easy to do research on who to follow

Just caught up on this conversation. Thanks, @cryptoisgood @skilesare @wpb @diegop @LightningLad91 @manu @justmythoughts @lara @Dylan for the great input.

@wpb I'll send you an email and we can hash out a strategy based on the comments here. I have a few things I need to chat to you about anyway.

@skilesare icdev.org seems to have disappeared from the ic0.app proposal page
![image|534x500](upload://dxhqONrWiFY5HX2XQrIaaXS6Bw6.png) and Anvil
If anyone knows the relevant person in charge, please report this issue

-------------------------

This isn’t an ic0.app page.  This is from the dashboard.  @Dylan did you notice this?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-08-21 13:01:35 UTC | #89

@ysyms @wpb i noticed this a couple days ago. All of the neurons are still there, but only a few show up. If you sort by name (tap “name”) you can see it shift them around and the others will show up.

Would be great if we could just scroll though.

Dylan | 2022-08-22 15:10:03 UTC | #90

Thanks, this will be fixed today.

@diegop , I just wanted to clarify one point regarding how renaming of neurons can be done even if we just realise " **Add removing functionality**": 

I think people above have pointed out that actually you can already achieve the renaming of a known neuron, namely by submitting a second proposal to register the same neuron under a different name (which will overwrite its current name).
I just wanted to clarify that this would reinforce that we just need to add the removal functionality. Renaming can then either be done as suggested above (sending another register neuron proposal) or as suggested in my previous message (sending a remove known neuron proposal followed by a register known neuron proposal).
