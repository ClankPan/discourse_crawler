Hello there!

we are happy to announce that voting is now open for [a new IC release ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/rc--2022-10-19_18-31).
The NNS proposal is here: [IC NNS Proposal 87631 ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/87631).

A particular highlight is the partial rollout of the DTS feature (for the `install_code` message) on all subnets.

Here is a summary of the changes since the last release:

```
* Consensus: Only enable new signal handler for x86_64 linux
* Consensus: Validate block proposal/CUP during conversion from protobuf
* Consensus: crypto_hash clean up
* Crypto: Deduplicate iDKG transcript deserialization
* Crypto: Make KeyId immutable and implement From trait
* Crypto: Reading node's keys from both dedicated folders and from crypto_root.
* Crypto: Remove key ID as returned value from vault api
* Crypto: Use ic_bls12_381 from crates.io instead of directly from Github
* Crypto: implement Pippenger's multi-exp algorithm for K-256 and P-256, tests and benches
* Execution: Log message refund execution cycles
* Execution: Observe subnet call metrics
* Message Routing: Improve state sync metrics
* Message Routing: Rate limit spammy log message
* Message Routing: Remove mention of COW from replica dashboard
* Networking: Don't implement From<ProxyDecodeError> for RegistryClientError
* Networking: Move the gossip message types into their own module
* Networking: Remove unused methods from the chunkable trait
* Networking: Use infallible instead of HttpError where possible
* Networking: [H2 Migration] Handshake working
* Node: Remove unused 'ic.json5' configuration files
* Orchestrator: Increase certified time monotonically
* Orchestrator: Request ECDSA key ID from source subnet and handle rsync recursion during recovery
* Runtime: Apply `cycles_debit` when aborting a paused execution
* Runtime: Remove module_sharing flag
* Runtime: Save prepaid cycles in response callback
* Runtime: Set the ingress state to `Processing` in DTS execution
* Runtime: Use a separate instruction limit for heartbeat and query
* Various tech-debt management: code refactoring, docs, bug fixes, test updates
```

And a complete list of changes can of course be found on GitHub.

This other build will enable DTS on regular messages, and in this release cycle we'll deploy it to a single subnet only:
