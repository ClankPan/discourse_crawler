Error: `Node.mo:13.31-13.39: type error [M0056], variable Canister is in scope but not available in compiled code`

dfx: `0.15.2-beta.1`

Hi I am trying to create a child Node canister if the parent Node's storage is full...
or I must not create a child Node canister within the parent Node canister? What is the best practice for this?

Compiled actor classes cannot be recursive in this way. This is a limitation of the way they are compiled a t the moment.

Your best best to move the create functionality elsewhere, perhaps into the code that imports the actor class.
