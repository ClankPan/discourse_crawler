I have added a hotkey to one of my SNS neurons. When I call `get_neuron` on the governance canister of the SNS, I can find the `principal` in the `permission` list and it has `permission_type` 3 and 4 set. The main principal that was used to create this neurons has permissions 0 to 10 set.

![image|690x140](upload://2G8TnjiRtIlPrBQONRTAOVeSQuC.png)

I've found [this description](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/64341c68da2567c80fa9501eb8b0182dba7b72c6/packages/sns/src/enums/governance.enums.ts#L4) about the meaning of each permission. 

1. Is this description correct and still up to date or is there another place where the meaning of each permission is documented?

2. Also, is it possible to set also other permissions for hotkeys than only "submit proposals" (3) and "vote" (4) via the NNS frontend?

Hi @Dustin , 

1) the description you linked to is I think from the frontend. I assume it is mostly up to date, but if you want to be super sure that you are up to date, the source of the backend code is [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/cd8ad64ed63e38db0d40386ba226df25767d4cd6/rs/sns/governance/proto/ic_sns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L12).
Of course, you might have to be careful with the version: it could be that the lastest gitversion is not yet published / approved by the NNS and it can be that a given SNS governance canister is not yet upgraded to the latest published version by the NNS. But I don't recall that the permissions have recently changed, so right now this might not be a problem.
2) The answer to this is "no" (just confirmed with the team working on this). The frontend was deliberately kept simple and as similar as possible to the concept of hotkeys in the NNS for usability.
