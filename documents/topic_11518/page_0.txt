FYI for those out there deving off of the internet identity package ... Github finalized their changes for unauthed git: access ...  and the Internet Identity repo needs to get update to make a change ... you might get an error like this:

```
Caused by:
  remote error:
    The unauthenticated git protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported.
  Please see https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/ for more information.
  ; class=Net (12)
```
today March 15 they finalized the change... scroll down to "when"
https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/

you can move forward by changing this file:
```
vi src/internet_identity/Cargo.toml
```
and changing line 12 from "git://" to "https://" ... and continue on your merry way ...

This issue should have been fixed by [this pull request](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/pull/502) to the Internet Identity repository a few months ago.

I recommend pulling down the latest Internet Identity repo changes and seeing if this issue still exists for you.
