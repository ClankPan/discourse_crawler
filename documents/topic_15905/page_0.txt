Hello there!

we are happy to announce that voting is now open for [a new IC release ](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/rc--2022-10-13_18-31).
The NNS proposal is here: [IC NNS Proposal 86279](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/86279).

A particular highlight is the increase of stable memory to 32GB per canister.

Here is a summary of the changes since the last release:

```
* Consensus: Add command get-ecdsa-signing-subnets to ic-admin
* Consensus: Avoid duplicate signers in aggregate
* Consensus: Check height in validate_transcript_refs
* Consensus: Drop support shares with invalid dealer
* Consensus: Fix spurious errors in Dkg Key Manager
* Consensus: Handle canister http response divergence
* Consensus: Include timeout in payload size calc
* Consensus: Fix ECDSA object dedup logic
* Crypto: Deduplicate verification threshold check for iDKG transcripts
* Crypto: Make KeyId an internal type of crypto
* Crypto: Make TlsHandshake trait mockable by returning TlsTream as trait object
* Crypto: Remove obsolete Clone trait bounds for RNGs
* Crypto: Remove obsolete ed25519-dalek from external crates repository
* Crypto: introduce CSP vault API for obtaining (public) randomness
* Execution: Add time to subnet call context
* Execution: Bitcoin: Update the threshold of serving multiple blocks
* Execution: Refactor `AvailableMemory` and `SubnetAvailableMemory` into a single SubnetAvailableMemory
* Execution: Refine the maximum bitcoin payload size.
* Execution: Remove unused code Metadata State
* Message Routing: Add command to compute canister hashes to state tool
* Message Routing: Do not reload states from tip
* Message Routing: Extra checks on stream slice deserialization
* Message Routing: Persist IngressHistoryState::next_terminal_time
* Message Routing: Persist `OutputQueues::timeout_index`
* Message Routing: Remove QueueIndex in favor of usize for queue indices.
* Message Routing: Removes `get_state_sync_chunk` introduced by COW
* Networking: Atomic health status refresh layer
* Networking: Do some renaming in P2P to match better the intent
* Networking: Don't create service on each connection
* Networking: Don't hold the lock of receive_check_caches  until the end of on_chunk method.
* Networking: Enable adapter metrics collection
* Networking: Limit the number of live TCP connections for the metrics endpoint and the Http Handler
* Networking: Remove the peer label from few more transport metrics
* Networking: Use the faster and fair parking_lot Mutex and RwLock in the download manager
* Networking: [H2 Transport Migration][1/N] Add H2 flag
* Node: Added progress bar to hostOS and guestOS installation
* Node: Added pv to packages.common
* Node: Fix update img determinism with k8s runners
* Orchestrator: Add release_package_urls field
* Orchestrator: Don't store certified time during registry replicator init to indicate up-to-date local store
* Runtime: Do not add heartbeat task to long-running DTS canisters
* Runtime: Drop redundant DTS notification in the sandbox.
* Runtime: Increase stable memory to 32GB
* Runtime: Increase throughput of subnet messages with DTS
* Runtime: Limit dirty pages
* Runtime: Pre-calculate dirty pages
* Various tech-debt management: code refactoring, docs, bug fixes, test updates
