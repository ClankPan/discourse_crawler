Greetings IC Developers! üöÄ

I'm excited to announce a brand-new Github organization (https://github.com/internet-computer-protocol) designed to bring together the ICP developer community! This will be a collaborative space for all members to contribute, innovate, and foster growth within the ICP developer ecosystem. The repos within this organization will be co-owned and maintained by our dedicated community members.

We're eager to hear your thoughts on how we can best utilize this organization and structure its repositories. One idea is to begin with essential developer libraries, such as the ETH integration phase 1 library. Your input is invaluable, so please share your suggestions!

If you're passionate about the ICP community and interested in becoming a maintainer of this Github organization, we'd love to hear from you. Simply leave a comment and join our mission to empower the IC developer community!

[EDIT] I should further state that this initiative is a community effort and not a Dfinity initiative, and I‚Äôm posting as a member of the community. Whether it‚Äôs possible to move existing Dfinity repos out is subject to Dfinity‚Äôs internal rules and approvals and is outside of the scope of this thread.

This is a great initiative!

How will CLAs and licensing work here?

How will GitHub roles be set up? Who will have admin permissions?

-------------------------

This is a great milestone!

All those remain open questions. We need volunteers to help with the initial set up.

The idea is to have the most active and reputable members of the community collectively maintain it.

So these are all things that can be decided by the community? Dfinity is not imposing any restrictions on the org?

-------------------------

frederikrothenberger | 2023-04-20 11:37:16 UTC | #6

@benji: Is it also the idea to move some existing developer infrastructure?

Candidates for that could e.g. be the [test-state-machine-client repo](https://github.com/dfinity/test-state-machine-client), which has already received some community contributions.

That is correct. Dfinity and its employees are also welcome to voluntarily contribute, but will not impose any restrictions.

-------------------------

benji | 2023-04-20 12:42:20 UTC | #8

@frederikrothenberger In the beginning we are looking at things decoupled from the IC core infrastructure, i.e. code that does not impact the IC binaries, and does not depend on/impact Dfinity's CI/CD pipeline. The level of existing community contribution is of lesser concern here, because the community can and do already contribute to repos in the Dfinity github org.

I should further state that this initiative is a community effort and not a Dfinity initiative, and I'm posting as a member of the community. Whether it's possible to move existing Dfinity repos out is subject to Dfinity's internal rules and approvals and is outside of the scope of this thread.

I'm thrilled to hear about the launch of the new Github organization. It's an excellent initiative to bring together the ICP developer community, which will foster collaboration and innovation, ultimately leading to growth within the ecosystem.

Regarding the structure of repositories within the organization, it would be great to focus on building essential developer libraries that are required for building applications on ICP. Additionally, providing tools and frameworks that make it easier for developers to interact with ICP's network would be valuable.

As for becoming a maintainer of the organization, I'm interested and would love to contribute my expertise to the community. Please let me know how I can get involved and support the mission of empowering the IC developer community.

Great idea and I agree with @quint, we should focus on developper experience.

Thanks for your enthusiasm and support! If you would like to be a maintainer, please tell us a bit more about yourself, so that the community could know who you are and why you're here.

@quint Thanks! I've sent you an invite.
@NathanosDev Thanks for your interest, but we already have 3 members from Dfinity (John, Dieter and me), and we aim to have a healthy distribution amongst Dfinity people and developers from the community (3 from Dfinity, 4 from the community). Sorry we can't include you now, but maybe in the future when we will have more maintainers. Thanks again!

Great initiative but why is this not built on the decentralized github instead? https://codebase.org/

If you dont use it, who will?

-------------------------

quint | 2023-04-22 07:41:56 UTC | #22

I guess the main reason is that Codebase has not been released yet... and thus not a usable alternative (at this point in time).

Codebase is definitely our preferred option once it's available! One big advantage is that it can be controlled by a DAO with all of its decentralisation benefits (as opposed to GitHub which requires admin accounts to be set up in an organisation and thus the very purpose of this post to call for community maintainers to ensure proper decentralisation).

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-04-24 13:51:26 UTC | #26

Is anyone interested in maintaining the ic-sqlite Azle and Kybra plugins within this organization? Would that be appropriate?

Azle and Kybra (TypeScript CDK and Python CDK) are likely to have many npm and PyPI packages that community members will want. Demergent Labs does not plan to maintain all (any?) of them, and we're hoping the community will step up.

-------------------------

cymqqqq | 2023-04-25 01:00:06 UTC | #27

I'm interested in ic-sqlite, I can learn the code first, and maintain it in my spare time.:)

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-05-04 13:57:55 UTC | #28

So the original dev that inspired the ic-sqlite plugin will probably be maintaining it actually (I found out after posting here), but we'll hopefully need many more plugins in the future.
