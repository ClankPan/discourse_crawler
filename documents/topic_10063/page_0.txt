In case anyone has needed a SHA256 implementation in Motoko for type Blob (not type [Nat8]). I made one here:
https://github.com/timohanke/motoko-sha2/releases/tag/v1.0.0

You can use it for `data` of any of the types `Blob`, `[Nat8]` or `[var Nat8]` in the exact same way, simply by writing `sha256(data.vals())`. That is because under the hood it accepts an iterator.

For the record: This has been superseded by https://mops.one/sha2 which is vastly more performant.
