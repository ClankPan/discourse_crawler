We are glad to introduce our project: **Shiku Architect Studio Tool** in Shiku Metaverse here on the forums.

**What is the Shiku Architect Studio?**

Architects cannot leverage the new opportunities in the metaverse industry, because they have no tool to monetize their own designs and easily integrate them into the metaverse. The **Shiku Architect Studio** provides architects with a tool for monetizing their designs as NFTs and easily integrating them into the metaverse.

The Shiku Architect Tool:
* is an infrastructure tool for architects using the IC technology;
* will enable architects to easily integrate 3D architecture models into the metaverse;
* takes 3D model files in different formats and allows them to be easily displayed directly on the virtual land in Shiku metaverse;
* is where **3D models of architectural designs are minted on the ICP as NFTs** and listed for buying and selling on Yumi Marketplace (integrated with Shiku).
