Hey :wave:

I've built a demo app that leverages [Juno](https://juno.build) serverless functions to query the OpenAI API from a satellite canister with HTTP outcalls.

You can have fun here 👉 https://pycrs-xiaaa-aaaal-ab6la-cai.icp0.io

But probably more interesting for the forum, the solution is open source 👉 https://github.com/peterpeterparker/juno-openai

Ping me for questions!

Thats cool, but what are the cost factor with the Out Calls needing to take place?

It's just a **demo**. I've allocated enough cycles to make my showcase happen, but the solution can be improved. If you want to explore it further, you can fork and deploy the repo here: [https://github.com/peterpeterparker/juno-openai](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/juno-openai)

What i am saying is that Outcalls are expensive! and they need to start comparing all prices to Amazon if they want to be taken seriously - not comparing to Ethereum etc...
