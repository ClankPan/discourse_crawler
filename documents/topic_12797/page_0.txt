Given the last thread created by @lastmjs, @dostro and @Litzi, I red again the previous [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-lack-of-security/9144?u=roman). There, we were several discovering the necessity of not staking significative amount of ICP within a neuron created through II (it was before the existence of Ledger Hardwallet integration). There, @timo had said :

No, if you have staked with II then you can’t change that. Maybe a future upgrade to the NNS will allow changing the controller of neurons. If that happened then you could change it. But I don’t know when or if that will ever happen. The reason that the neuron controller cannot be changed is so that neurons can’t be sold. That’s something the community has to decide if it wants to continue to prevent the sale of neurons and how. If someone comes up with mechanisms that allow to change the controller of a neuron while at the same time preventing a sale then changing the controller can be allowed.

And @LightningLad91 had answered :

@wpb perhaps you and I should get together and work on a proposal for allowing neuron transfers. We’ve talked about this topic frequently in the past; but, given what I’ve learned in this thread I’d really like to have the ability to transfer control of my neuron to my Ledger Nano in the future.

Here is my point : even after the improvement of the II proposed by @lastmjs, @dostro and @Litzi, the need for securing icp staked into these old neurons will stay entire. Since the community globally wants to prevent the sale of neurons, why not allow only temporarily a neurons' controller change, just enough to make people able of relocating their old unsecured neurons under the controlling of their  Ledger Hardwallet ? By doing this, the first stakers could benefit of the Hardwallet security.
