The GIX team will also make a proposal to update the SNS aggregator shortly.  That proposal will contain the following changes:

* In fast updates, update `derived_state` and `lifecycle` as well as the now deprecated `swap_state`. This means that while an SNS sale is in progress, more data will be update frequently.
* New field `logo` in the metadata with the relative path to the logo asset.
* Add a getting started section in landing page.

Disburse maturity of sns neurons.
[/quote]

Hi, is the modulation for disbursement of sns-neurons based on the icp/xdr rate like the nns-neurons?

Yes, it is.

See the wiki page for more info.

Let me also ask the comms team to update it to also explain the SNS neurons there.

Thanks!
