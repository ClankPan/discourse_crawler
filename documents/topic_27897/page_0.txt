Hello everyone,

We've submitted a proposal to add a new rule to the replica firewall. The proposal is to allowlist the IPv6 prefix `2001:4c08:2003:b09::/64`, used by the DFINITY-operated DC in Stockholm (`sh1`). This will enable us to deploy additional boundary nodes (currently, one is ready).

This is only a temporary measure. Once the boundary nodes are split into API boundary nodes and HTTP gateways, and the API boundary nodes are fully deployed under the NNS, this will no longer be necessary.

Let me know if you have any questions!
