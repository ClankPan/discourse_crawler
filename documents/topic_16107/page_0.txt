I want to upgrade `dfx` from the current stable version (0.11.2) to the latest pre-release (0.12.0.beta.3), so I can use the new language features in the latest [Motoko Compiler release](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/releases/tag/0.7.0).

`dfx upgrade` only allows me to upgrade to 0.11.2 

I think the reason it's not working is the new versions are not in the manifest https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/public/manifest.json

I think you have to reinstall:

DFX_VERSION=<version_I_want_to_use> sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

Thanks, It turns out I just misspelt the pre-release version. **0.12.0.beta.3**-> **0.12.0-beta.3**
