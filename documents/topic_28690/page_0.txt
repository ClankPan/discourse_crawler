Hello everyone! I found this forum when researching more in depth information regarding The Internet Computer.

I began staking my ICP via the NNS recently and have read various pieces of information on how with the newer system in place in regards to maturity accrual and disbursement, that no taxes have to be paid if the staking rewards stay as maturity and/or compounded onto the base principal being staked.

With that said, I recently spoke with a local tax advisor here in the United States that deals with crypto. I had asked them to confirm if in fact I wouldn't be taxed on the maturity and just when I burst the neuron, I explained this in simpler terms to them. They equated the concept of the maturity to a bond, basically said when I get that maturity it is taxed then. Is there a way to help reinforce the notion that is not the case to them?

Let me know if the above information is accurate or false though. Thank you in advance as well for any suggestions/information.
