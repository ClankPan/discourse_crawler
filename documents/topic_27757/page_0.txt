Is there a list of all available dfx extensions, and information on what each extension contains (i.e. canisters) before installing it?

For now we only have the `nns` and `sns` extensions. You can find all of them [here](https://github.com/dfinity/dfx-extensions/tree/main/extensions). In the respective folders there's a README

Thanks for the reference link. I see the available commands with that extension, but not the canisters that come with the `nns` extension.

https://github.com/dfinity/dfx-extensions/blob/main/extensions/nns/README.md

I do see what's covered if I dig into the tests https://github.com/dfinity/dfx-extensions/blob/main/extensions/nns/e2e/tests/nns.bash#L61, but I don't see a list of included canisters in the README.

Previously, I was using dfx 0.14.1 (pre dfx extensions, using dfx nns install/import directly) which had an `nns-dapp` canister. This canister is not present in the (dfx version 0.16.1) nns extension currently, but installing the nns extension gives an output of

```

Backend canisters:
nns-registry rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai
nns-governance rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
nns-ledger ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
nns-root r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai

nns-sns-wasm qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai
nns-ic-ckbtc-minter qjdve-lqaaa-aaaaa-aaaeq-cai
```

From this, I can see that the `nns-dapp` was renamed to `nns-ui`, however that canister isn't covered in the [e2e test link](https://github.com/dfinity/dfx-extensions/blob/main/extensions/nns/e2e/tests/nns.bash#L61) and a candid declaration file isn't being generated for during import/install (breaks CI for me when going from 0.14.1 to > 0.16.1). I solved this by just removing nns-dapp/nns-ui from our dfx.json (since it isn't being used anyways), but part of this confusion comes from not knowing what canisters & are included in the extension before installing it.
