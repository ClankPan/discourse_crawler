Hi, my name's Alex Lorimer, full-stack Software Developer, and member of CodeGov and Synapse. As such I'm committed to voting on **IC OS Version Election** proposals, as well as **Governance** and **SNS & Neurons' Fund** proposals. **Subnet Management** is another topic that I've become interested in reviewing.

I reject proposals that that I consider to be inaccurate, misleading, and/or not in the best interests of the Internet Computer and the community that it serves. I always aim to leave evidence of my due diligence in the form of comments and questions on the DFINITY forum. On all other topics I wait for the outcome of a proposal to be decided before following the prevailing vote (to avoid any chance of influencing the outcome when I haven't personally performed due diligence).

I'm planning to submit a known neuron proposal in the next week or so to offer others a neuron to follow who share my voting principles. Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything. Thank you üôè

**Thank you** to those who have shown their support. The proposal is now live -> Proposal 131739 [NNS Dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=131739) / [ICP Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131739)

Please vote, and/or let me know if there's anything you'd like me to clarify :)

Last time I approved a proposal this early I was voting on periodical followee reset.

**Thanks both, and all who have voted so far!**

Hilarious and ironic that I've actually misspelt 'dil**l**igent' in my known neuron description. That's what I get for editing the proposal late last night before submitting üòÇ Never mind üòÅ

In [all the excitement this weekend](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/grants-for-voting-neurons/32721), I forgot to link to my successfully executed **LORIMER** known neuron! :tada: :partying_face: :balloon: [Neuron: LORIMER - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16459595263909468577)
