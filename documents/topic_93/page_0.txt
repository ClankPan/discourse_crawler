Hey everybody,

I made a new user on my macbook air specifically to mess around with the SDK. I gave the new user admin privileges but I still got a "permission denied" error when calling the dfx command in a terminal. I could get around it by using sudo but that was a little annoying to use every time. If anybody has the same problem I fixed it with the following command: sudo chmod -R u=rwX,go=rX /usr/local/bin

Kind regards,

Fulco
