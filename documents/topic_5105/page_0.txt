Hello i have 2 tutorials that crash on, i think:
https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/custom-frontend.html

and

https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/tutorials/my-contacts.html


1) npm install --save react react-dom

â „ Installing node dependencies...

I get the message below, i was wondering what to do about this and maybe this the cause that i fail to execute the tutorial?! ,, besides my little knowledge. just was interested in how to apply web visual design with icp dfinity in combination with react. if react fails. is it possible to make a tutorial without react but still possible to make something as a webdesigner?

npm WARN contacts_assets@0.1.0 No repository field.

npm WARN contacts_assets@0.1.0 No license field.

I really do all the steps as is written down but i keep getting some message about wasm.

Details: ReplicaError { reject_code: 3, reject_message: "IC0304: Attempt to execute a message on canister ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai which contains no Wasm module" }
