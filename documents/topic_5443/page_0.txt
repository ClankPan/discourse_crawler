What happens to canisters when they run out of cycles. Do they ever get deleted if they run out of cycles after a certain point? 

Thanks,

Messages are not routed to the canister below a specific cycle balance. That limit is calculated to be enough for a several weeks to store the canister (currently $5/G/y afaik). But if the canister completely runs out of cycles then will be deleted.
