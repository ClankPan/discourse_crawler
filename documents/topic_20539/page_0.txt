Are there any recent examples showing how to use Python to build frontend on ICP?

I am trying to build a simple website using Pyodide and deploy it on ICP. 

I only found @crabtr26 post, sharing a demo but couldn't find any Python code in it or understood how they built it -_- (https://github.com/crabtr26/digit_guesser).

I don't know of any, but I'm sure it's possible. @cryptoschindler I see you contributed to [ic-py](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py). Do you know if there is an example of it running in an asset canister?

@lastmjs I know Kybra is for canisters, but do you maybe know of an example?

I highly doubt there's any example, but if you use something like Pyscript it should be simple. Just build and deploy it to an asset canister. Using ic-py or the agent connecting from JavaScript should be possible, but I haven't done it.
