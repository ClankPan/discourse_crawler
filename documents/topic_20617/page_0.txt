Is there any way to check if a canister is busy? 
By busy, I mean checking canister have update calls queued up or number of update calls queued up?

The input queue sizes are not exposed to the canister and to the user, so AFAIK there is no direct way to check if canisters is busy. An indirect way would be to make an update call and measure its latency.
