## 1. Objective
This is a governance motion proposal to increase the rejection cost of NNS proposals from the current 1 ICP to 10 ICP.

## 2. Background
The NNS is the brain of the Internet Computer, and it relies on the neuron holders to carefully consider each proposal and cast an informed vote. Neuron holders are also financially incentivized to vote on all proposals, as not voting leads to reduced neuron rewards, meaning a neuron holder cannot simply ignore proposals. It is important that there are not too many proposals, as casting an informed vote is time consuming and the load on neuron holders must be manageable. To discourage “bad” proposals, there is a rejection cost: the neuron that creates a proposal will pay this fee if the proposal gets rejected. The rejection cost is currently set to 1 ICP. There is no fee for proposals that are accepted.

This proposal makes a failed proposal more expensive, which is expected to encourage people to first communicate with the community and gather support before actually submitting a proposal. Hopefully this leads to higher quality proposals and fewer proposals that end up getting rejected.

Why change this now? The rejection cost of 1 ICP is very low, but only recently has it become apparent that it is important enough to bring to a motion. Recently there have been many rejected NNS proposals, which caused us to submit this proposal now.

In the future, this rejection cost can be adjusted further in the upward or downward direction depending on what makes sense to the community.

## 3. Key Milestones
This proposal will be deliberated until the comments go quiet and will then be submitted to the NNS as a governance motion proposal. If it passes, then I will work with Dfinity to learn how to submit this proposal as a NetworkEconomics proposal or to ask Dfinity to submit it themselves.

## 4. Discussion leads
@LightningLad91 will lead discussion on this proposal and submit the NNS proposal.

## 5. Security concerns
No security concerns have been identified at this time.

## 6. What we are asking the community
* Review comments, ask questions, provide actionable feedback
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion.

I would have said no a week ago but I'm ready for the the situation to end because of the methodology of the proposing party and contents of the proposals, so I 100% agree with this proposal as a band-aid solution.

Was there a discussion on what the spam prevention mechanism (on Dfinity's roadmap) will entail? I missed that discussion if info was given.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-13 03:57:24 UTC | #3

@ysyms said (and I believe) that a whale can easily obtain 100 ICP rewards per new governance proposal.  So how would 10 ICP stop a whale from proposing?
Also, it is not because a proposal is voted No that it was a bad, or scam, proposal. That would only make people being scared to submit a proposal.
I do not think a different amount of ICP would resolve anything, short term or long term.
And I think IC cannot do new changes on a "Try and Fail" system, where you do the programming, implement,  and then it fail.  It has to be totally proof to resolve the issue.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-13 04:05:34 UTC | #4

My first rejected proposal was when ICP was at $80.  Whoops. It was an accident from messing with Axon. $80 was bad, $800 would have gotten me kicked out of the bedroom for week. :joy:

I'm not opposed to this, but I also don't think that getting a named neuron should be more expensive than a domain name.  That is about 1 ICP right now.  We want more named neurons.

I think I'd like to leave it the same and find a better solution.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-04-13 06:37:16 UTC | #6

I agree it probably would discourage some people from making an attempt, but I’m not sure if the proposal cost would deter any quality named neurons from being formed, I think conversely it might encourage more carefully constructed ideas around named neurons and people would be more likely to gauge community opinion before trying, decreasing the likelihood of a proposal rejection.

Reposted because I thought I didn't respond as a reply... oops.

-------------------------

quinto | 2022-04-13 07:31:13 UTC | #7

I hope this is temporary measure, because it makes it harder for someone to become a named neuron.

But actually, I don't see any reason to go through NNS proposal to change the named neuron list. We just need some curated list (or lists) that is vetted by the community, e.g. a github repo where PRs are regularly reviewed. No need for proposals.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-13 10:27:45 UTC | #8

What if rejection cost was in cycles or was pegged to a fixed value in XDR/USD? ICP price is volatile, if it increases or decreases too much in a short amount of time, we'd have to constantly keep changing the rejection cost, it would be better to design a proposal to fix the issue for once.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-13 11:21:55 UTC | #9

I support this proposal. There are many other ways to deal with spam proposals, which will all take a significant of time to realize. This is the only proposal that can take effect immediately. 

@skilesare, I understand your concern that making it more expensive if your proposal is rejected might discourage people from submitting a proposal, but I still believe increasing the cost is the right way to go for two reasons:
1. the cost can be decreased again if there is a better way to ensure proposals are of high quality, so this may just be temporary. 
2. Governance proposals typically get 40% or so participation rate, and other proposals even more. That means that at least 20% of the voting power = 80M VP is required for a proposal to pass. That's at least 40 million ICP that needs to vote in favor of a proposal for it to pass. I find it hard to imagine that neuron holders collectively holding 40 million ICP that all support a proposal cannot risk a potential 10 ICP reject fee for the proposal itself.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-13 15:05:45 UTC | #10

I don’t disagree with this idea, but I do consider it to be out of scope for the purpose of this proposal.  There is an existing mechanic designed into the code that enables a relatively simple change to proposal rejection cost and it is priced in ICP.  This proposal is focused solely on whether that proposal rejection cost in ICP denomination should be changed.  

I encourage someone to make a separate proposal to change the denomination of proposal rejection cost so it could be fixed to fiat price in some way, but at this time I don’t consider it to be my torch to carry.  I’d like to see others step up as leaders to make such a proposal.  I’d be happy to advise if needed.

-------------------------

daijianlin | 2022-04-14 06:36:40 UTC | #12

Does this mean a lot? I don't think so. Can you do something that more meaningful? or you can have a try, I would say no.

Sorry I don't understand.  10 ICP is nothing compared to the gains that a group of stakers would gain from spamming proposals.  Even 100 ICP.

There is no amount that's going to both stem the tide of crappy proposals and also have a low enough bar for anybody to participate.

I'd vote against this because it really doesn't accomplish anything positive, it's not even a band-aid on the problem.  I think we need some sort of two step submission process with a spam report button.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-14 07:17:29 UTC | #14

I agree that other changes are necessary, but those are just in the brainstorming phase. So the community first has to agree on an approach, and then code has to be written and rolled out, which means it will take quite a while before we can have any advantage of those mechanisms. Increasing the reject fee can take effect right now, it does not require any code to be written.

While agree that this doesn't fully remove the incentive to submit governance proposals, saying it doesn't accomplish anything is in my view not a fair assessment either. Imagine that one individual submits bad proposals using ICP donations to pay for the reject cost. If the person gets 50 ICP donations, that would mean 50 bad proposals today and with this change it would only pay for 5 bad proposals. I think that's an improvement.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-04-14 07:36:46 UTC | #15

I agree, and understand how complex rolling out new tested code for the governance canister is. 

Probably worth a try increasing the fee, but definitely full steam ahead on brainstorming a longer-term solution.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-14 12:54:50 UTC | #16

I intend to write a longer post explaining my position on this. In short, I share many of the same views as @manu. This is something we can do today while a better long-term solution is developed.

@wpb if you are looking for someone to take the lead on this deliberation and submit the proposal I would be happy to do so.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-14 14:01:16 UTC | #17

This sounds perfect @LightningLad91.  I will be happy to step aside and let you lead the effort on this proposal.  I will edit the original post indicating your role.  Do you want to start a new forum Governance topic or continue this forum Governance topic?  Thank you for taking a leadership role in this proposal.  My apologies for not recognizing that you intended to lead this proposal yourself.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-14 14:04:53 UTC | #18

On another thread, I proposed a participation threshold. Let say as an example, 5 millions votes.  IF the participation does not reach the threshold, the proposal is abandonned and ignored.
Then, only need to ignore these proposals.   Simple and keep proposals accessible for everyone.  Propably 1 line of code to add.
We can higher the threshold if needed.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-14 14:19:41 UTC | #19

Why would there not be 5 million votes when we are incentivized to vote with voting rewards?  Why would anyone choose not to vote if voting enables them to earn voting rewards?  ICP tokenomics are incentives to participate in governance.  The system is built on the principle that people will make decisions based on their individual self interest, which collectively results in the best interest of the IC.  We can’t depend on people to “do the right thing” because that means something different to everyone.  I think all ideas should be geared toward rewarding an increase in governance participation, not expecting people to abstain.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-14 14:28:52 UTC | #20

Abstain on spam proposal only. Not on everything else.  I am quiet confident the vast majority of voters would abstain if they see a spam proposal, including Dfinity and ICPMN.  That would leave the proposal with a very low participation, then being ignored by the system.  I have not made the calculation needed for the minimum, can be 10 millions minimum... Just as an example.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-14 15:02:45 UTC | #21

There is currently about 60M votes being cast on governance proposals that are not cast when Dfinity and ICPMN casts their votes.

Dfinity owns their votes and have full control of them.  

ICPMN owns 20 votes.  All other votes come from followers who choose to follow ICPMN.  That means they are also free to follow anyone else including a new group that pops up to vote on all proposals including spam.  

People will always pursue the highest voting rewards.  I still think we need the system to continue incentivizing participation.

Edit: others should check my math, but I think it’s finally correct.

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-04-14 15:54:09 UTC | #22

@wpb @Kyle_Langham I'd like to add one more idea - **new `Spam Filter` proposal type for rejected `Governance` proposals**, which would be **automatically created by `NNS` for every rejected Governance proposal** - and would decide, if those 1 (or 10, or 100) ICP will be burned or not.

 - anyone could create governance proposal same as now
 - could be with higher rejection cost, 10 or even 100 ICP
 - if proposal is Accepted, all is same as now, it was not a spam
 - **if proposal is Rejected it would NOT automatically mean that the (1, 10, 100) ICP is burned, but `NNS` will generate a new `Spam Filter` proposal**
     - **if `Spam Filter` proposal is Accepted by community, the (1, 10, 100) ICP would NOT be burned**
     - **if `Spam Filter` proposal is Rejected by community, the (1, 10, 100) ICP would be burned**
 
### I believe that this would:
1. discourage any spammer as per high rejection cost, this would be very effective
2. minimise governance administration as the `Spam Filter` proposal would be created only for Rejected Governance proposals
3. allow easy extension of the process also for other proposal types, in case that would start to be used for NNS spamming
4. give more confidence to anyone who would like to propose something relevant (would discuss it on forum etc), even with higher rejection cost - as the `Spam Filter` proposal voting would NOT be about the proposed change, but only if it is a Spam or not - and **if the proposal is relevant the funds would not be burned**
5. **`Rejection Cost` could be renamed to `Spam Rejection Cost`**

**Or indeed every proposal could come with a check box `Is Spam` - if is rejected and is not a spam nothing is burned, if is spam (>50% votes) ICP (1, 10, 100...) is burned (I think I saw similar already suggested by @Kyle_Langham)**

What do you think?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-04-14 15:32:46 UTC | #23

I totally agree with this. We have to rely on this irresistible truth : 

[quote="wpb, post:21, topic:12110"]
People will always pursue the highest voting rewards.
[/quote]

Faking or believing it is not the case will make us less efficient and slower.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-15 12:47:56 UTC | #24

I think this idea has a lot of potential and should be further deliberated within the community, particularly in context with the increased proposal cost.  If the proposal costs become prohibitive for NNS participants who fear they would lose the ICP on a good-faith proposal, then this would be a good remedy for that.  There's good arguments for us to consider this within the context of the anti-spam proposals, or to consider it on its own merit if the proposal cost increase is approved.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-15 19:13:59 UTC | #25

Thanks @wpb. We can continue with this one. I think there has been a lot of good discussion and I would hate to lose that by starting another post. Rather than recreate the post I will just clarify my reasons for supporting this proposal. 

1. **Do I see this as the final solution?**
No. I consider this to be a stop gap measure that will deter further exploitation by parties who simply want to increase their daily rewards, advertise products, and/or spread disinformation.

2. **Why not wait for a better solution to be implemented?**
Let's consider the following steps that have to be completed in order for a better (complex) solution to be implemented:

  - Community Activities
-- Brainstorming (1 week)
-- Community deliberates on a proposal (1 week)
-- Vote on a proposal (1 week)
-- Appeal to Dfinity for support developing the solution (1 week)
- Dfinity Activities
-- Dfinity drafts a design ( 4 weeks?)
-- Dfinity submits design for review (1 week)
-- Community votes on design (1 week)
-- Dfinity plans & schedules development/testing effort (1 week)
-- Indeterminate amount of lead time (months? - quite possible and understandable)
-- Dfinity develops the solution (2 weeks)
-- Dfinity tests the solution (2 weeks)
-- Dfinity submits code update to NNS (1 day)

  So based on that *very rough* estimate, we are looking at anywhere from 3-6 months (optimistically?). During this time the NNS will continue to be spammed and I believe this will cause stakeholders, and those looking to participate in governance, to lose respect for the NNS and become complacent in their voting habits. Basically, I think we will see less manual voting and more passive voting over time. 

3. **Why does this proposal not suffer from the same delays?**
Because the proposal type for increasing the cost already exists. We wouldn't need Dfinity's assistance in developing anything. Although, I will likely need some minor support constructing the correct dfx command.

4. **Am I concerned that this will deter meaningful proposals from being submitted?**
I think the term "meaningful" can have different connotations depending on the individual. For me, a meaningful proposal is more than just a good idea. It's a proposal that has already been deliberated amongst a community of stakeholders (not necessarily on this forum) and already has some backing. If those conditions are met then I do not see 10 ICP getting in the way of that community submitting the proposal.

5. **Would you support a proposal to reduce the cost when a better solution is implemented, or if the price of ICP increases substantially?**
Absolutely. I believe the proposal type exists exactly for that reason. To be adjusted as-needed.

Edit: I have zero insight into Dfinity's planning & scheduling. These estimates are based purely on my own observations over the last year.

-------------------------

eluemm | 2022-04-15 14:05:20 UTC | #26

I think another idea, similar to @plsak is proposing, would be increasing the ICP cost per rejected proposal. For example, the first rejected proposal would cost 1 ICP, then the second would be 2 ICP -- you could scale this in various ways (e.g., 1 ICP, 2 ICP, 4 ICP, 8 ICP, etc.). This would keep the barrier to submit proposals low for new individuals allowing for people to make mistakes (e.g., submitting a blank proposal) and submit new ideas. 

This system could also reset if someone gets a proposal accepted, thus, promoting quality proposals (i.e., someone has two proposals rejected and their third accepted; following this, their fourth proposal is back to 1 ICP). This could also be time gated (six months?) where your proposal cost resets back to 1 ICP after a certain amount of time.

Also, it can be combined with the current flat increase proposal but allow for the increase to be smaller.

One potential down side that I can see is that you could somewhat evade this by creating new accounts (minimum account age to submit a proposal?). I think maybe a mix of this plus the flat increase could make sense.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-04-15 18:33:01 UTC | #27

Long term a more detailed layered approach is needed to address the spam and quality issue.

But for short term practicality this proposal can deliver. After this we will have time to discuss other long term structural solutions.

I agre with this proposal as it is!

Roman | 2022-04-15 15:36:54 UTC | #28

Hey @LightningLad91 do you want any information in the first post changed to better reflect your thoughts?  I’d be happy to updated as per your preferences.

Also, do you think deliberation on this is proposal has gone quiet?  I know there have been comments, but do you think any of them are in scope for this proposal or are they ideas that need to be deliberated as separate proposals?  If you think the conversation has gone quite on this proposal, then I would support you moving forward with making this proposal.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-15 20:51:29 UTC | #30

Yes I think so. Seems like we can move forward.

@plsak @eluemm I think you’ve both proposed some good ideas and I recommend starting separate topics to discuss further. I’d be happy to spread the word if you choose to do so.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-16 00:20:08 UTC | #31

I think 10 ICP might be a bit too much, what about 5 ICPs?

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2022-04-16 02:58:19 UTC | #32

I think 10 ICP might be too little. We are proposing protocol level changes it shouldn’t be easy. I say 50ICP.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-16 08:52:29 UTC | #33

It's not easy at all, there is no guarantee the proposal will pass, the difficulty should be achieving majority not getting the funds to do a proposal.

-------------------------

ildefons | 2022-04-16 13:23:58 UTC | #34

I agree with the spirit of the proposal but I would price it in cycles to make is stable

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2022-04-16 16:32:46 UTC | #35

Is it possible to add a third option, to signal a spam or meaningless proposal where if majority people vote for it as opposed to "yes" or "no" the penalty is higher than just rejection?

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2022-04-16 16:41:37 UTC | #36

This would take the penalty off of mere rejection as well, I assume it was initially there to prevent spam

-------------------------

plsak | 2022-04-16 17:33:40 UTC | #37

Thank you @Kyle_Langham and @LightningLad91 !

I was just going to start a new topic with this update (**change `Rejection Cost` to `Spam Rejection Cost`**) but see that the proposal to increase rejection cost is already out, so let's wait for the result first:
https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55141

- **Note**, that my personal (strong) preference will be then the **check box `Is Spam` in every proposal**, due to **increase in administration with new `Spam Filter` proposals.**
  - **To have new `Spam Filter` proposals might seem manageable now, but when `SNS` is released the governance work will multiply, so simplicity will be very important here.**

Also note that if current proposal is accepted, the **10 ICP `Rejection Cost` will be a blocking factor for me so I won't be able to propose this (or other) change** (until `Rejection Cost` will be changed to `Spam Rejection Cost`) and will rely on `better ICP situated` community members with that.

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-04-16 17:21:27 UTC | #38

I thought we were waiting until the 18th?!

-------------------------

MurrayGroves | 2022-04-16 18:21:22 UTC | #39

Agree with this short-term. Maybe a good long-term idea is to have rejection cost adjust to ensure a target percentage of failed proposals? If a large proportion of proposals are rejected increase rejection cost, and vice versa.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-16 20:59:55 UTC | #40

@MrPink13 

The original proposal included the following language before I took it over:

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:12110"]
This proposal will be deliberated until the comments go quiet and will then be submitted to the NNS as a governance motion proposal.
[/quote]

@wpb and I had observed a slowdown in discussion (before today) so I decided to take it to the NNS. 

Personally, I think this proposal should be considered separately from the group of proposals being submitted on the 18th. My reason being that this is a temporary measure meant to reduce the amount of spam we’re experiencing while more long term solutions are developed.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-16 21:02:20 UTC | #41

@namyIC recently suggested a similar fix on Twitter. I would consider reaching out to each other to create a forum topic where we can discuss this proposal.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-17 02:20:23 UTC | #42

I want to suggest a unifying reward formula for proposal adoption/rejection:
        **Proposal Reward = (Adopt% - Reject%) * 10 ICP.**
That is, if Adopt gets x% of the total voting power and Reject gets y% of the total voting power, then the proposer should receive (x% - y%) * 10 ICP as rewards, which may be either positive or negative.

1. The simple majority rule should be applied here. Requirement of at least 3% of the total voting power is unnecessary (To see this point, you should deeply understand the principle of neutrality). The absolute majority rule is also unnecessary (It ignores the significance of abstention). Someone would say that x% - y% = 0.001% means nothing, but I totally disagree: Every vote counts. In reality, we may need a minimum requirement, but that is only because counting errors may exist. Obviously, in NNS, no counting errors can exist.
    (According to modern social choice theory, there are no best voting rules because of Arrow's impossibility theorem. But in NNS, the simple majority rule is indeed perfect: it satisfies anonymity, neutrality, Pareto principle, and positive responsiveness, and there are only two alternatives (adoption and rejection), implying that Arrow's impossibility theorem does not apply anymore.)

2. If x% - y% > 0, then your proposal is good and should be rewarded with (x% - y%)* 10 ICP; if x% - y% < 0, then your proposal is bad and should be punished with (x% - y%)* 10 ICP. I feel very strange that the adopted proposals are not rewarded. This seems very unfair to those people who submitted so many good proposals. I think it is obviously a good way of incentivizing people to submit good proposals to improve ICP’s governance. (See my another thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-declaration-of-an-icp-hodler/12197)

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-17 04:56:03 UTC | #43

I'm pretty firmly against any proposals that will erect barriers for newcomers to the IC ecosystem. In this case, we're talking about a financial barrier that will result in a diluted form of censorship.

While this proposal may fix the issue in the short term, who's to say that NNS voters would vote to revert the proposal cost back to 1 ICP, and why would they - voters would rather just sit tight and have less proposals to vote on and worry about.

If this proposal passes, like hell am I going to spend ~$200 USD on submitting a proposal. I'd probably try to go crowdfund through a DAO or prominent IC organization like IC Maxis, but then we're introducing centralization into the NNS proposal submission process.

Also, if the price of ICP goes up over time, this will mean early investors will be able to submit more proposals than newcomers.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-17 02:34:07 UTC | #44

I agree, I'm not going to spend 10 ICP to make a proposal either

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-17 02:42:19 UTC | #45

I really like the way you think here, especially since you are considering how to incentivize good proposals while at the same time suggesting significant penalties for poor proposals.  

I suspect @LightningLad91 will say that this idea is not in scope for this proposal topic, but I think it is worth shaping further as another proposal topic.  It doesn't have to be presented as a proposal to mitigate spam either, so you could develop it any time.

The last non-spam proposal to pass was the ICDevs RegisterKnownNeuron proposal, which would have awarded the proposer 352 ICP.  The last non-spam proposal to fail was the Temp Check to Rename the Internet Computer, which would have cost the proposer 182 ICP (Dfinity didn't vote).  Those are some really strong incentives to only make proposals that you are confident will pass.  At this time, we have up to 46% of total voting power that is voting on governance proposals, which could be a reject cost as high as 460 ICP.  That's a lot of ICP that a proposer would need to have in their proposals neuron.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-04-17 03:51:59 UTC | #46

This could produce a different kind of spam where people generally propose things that everyone agrees with but that does not actually do anything. 

The NNS where every day is declared "Wenzel Bartlett Day" because who can vote against that? :joy:

...a jest, but where is the line between spam and ineffective.

I think we hold Tokens and the effectiveness of great proposals that increase token price **should** be enough to incentivize their creation.

On the negative side, it is a hell of a club to bash people with.  Maybe it should be on an exponetial scale so only significant losses end with that kind of penalty.  We do want good debate and a 40% to 60% vote could still be really valuable to the community(think Temp checks).

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-17 12:03:20 UTC | #47

I agree, it’s definitely a club. It’s not the perfect solution and I’d like to see other solutions implemented. That being said, this is the only change (that I’m aware of) that we can push without depending on Dfinity for development. The rejection cost has always been described as a spam deterrent. It seems logical to use the tools we have available while trying to build new ones.

Hasn’t there always been a financial barrier in place? The 1 ICP rejection cost has always been described as a spam deterrent. With the lower market price of ICP this deterrent is no longer effective.

I disagree. My experience has shown that the most active community members want to promote active governance participation and would probably be the first people to recommend lowering the cost when the time is right.

Personally, I have stated in several places that I support this as a temporary measure only. If/when better solutions are put in place for spam prevention, or if the ICP market takes off, I will happily submit a proposal to reduce the cost.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:43, topic:12110"]
I’d probably try to go crowdfund through a DAO or prominent IC organization like IC Maxis, but then we’re introducing centralization into the NNS proposal submission process.
[/quote]

I think that would be a good path to take. If you can raise the 10 ICP then you’d probably have solid support to kickoff your proposal. 

I don’t see how crowdfunding can be considered centralization. To me, centralization implies a lack of any other option; being forced to go down one path. Nothing in this proposal is mandating that the funds come from any specific organization.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:43, topic:12110"]
Also, if the price of ICP goes up over time, this will mean early investors will be able to submit more proposals than newcomers.
[/quote]

That’s true; but, how is that any less true if we keep the cost at 1 ICP. If the cost of 1 ICP skyrockets it would still be the early participants that can submit more.

Well said @LightningLad91.  I agree with every point you made here.  Thanks for offering this clarification.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-18 08:41:42 UTC | #50

I have a very simple idea: Change the current Adopt/Reject voting system into the following:
(1) Adopt with 10 ICP; (2) Adopt; (3) Abstain; (4) Reject; (5) Reject with -10 ICP.
It is still a simple majority rule: the option with the most voting power is the voting result. (If there is a tie, then the option with the largest index among those with the most voting power is the voting result.)
It can be easily changed into systems with more options such as:
(1) Adopt with 20 ICP; (2) Adopt with 10 ICP; (3) Adopt with 1 ICP; (4) Adopt; (5) Abstain; (6) Reject; (7) Reject with -1 ICP; (8) Reject with -10 ICP; (9) Reject with -20 ICP.
It also solves the spam/ineffective issue proposed by @skilesare since a "Wenzel Bartlett Day" proposal may be adopted with 0 ICP.

Hasn’t there always been a financial barrier in place? The 1 ICP rejection cost has always been described as a spam deterrent. With the lower market price of ICP this deterrent is no longer effective.

These are both great points that I 100% agree with. It’s why I would actually prefer if we pegged the cost of creating an NNS proposal to XDR like we do with the cycle exchange rate.

Zooming out, it feels like regardless of how expensive the proposal cost ends up being that we’re setting an arbitrary price on the cost of creating a proposal in order to stop proposals from coming in. This is by definition a barrier/disincentive. We could to raise the cost to 100 ICP, or we could choose to lower it the cost to 0.1 ICP - both would have very different intended and unintended side effects. 

However, what is the true cost of each proposal to the NNS? - probably less than or close to 1 ICP after all the votes are tallied and rewards disbursed. **So raising the proposal creation cost past what is strictly necessary to run it on the NNS results in an unnecessary burn of ICP**. It is an artificial financial barrier the community can choose to (or not to) play with for whatever agenda they wish to accomplish.

If independent creators are forced to go through DAOs or other IC orgs to just to get their proposals funded and onto the IC, this means creators have to get support from those who already have money or influence, and opens up the door for big money to earmark proposals in return for funding. 

It’s a similar model to getting a business off the ground and needing to request VC funding in return for X equity/board seat/add in this ad revenue feature to your app, or proposing a bill as a congressman/woman and having each politician say they’ll vote for it if you include the X thing I want.

Here’s my dream proposal:
- Makes creating proposals as cheap as possible (to incentivize independent fresh ideas and discussion),
- Puts sustainable mechanisms and filters in place that tackle proposal spam
- Does not introduce a mechanism or feature that censors or prohibits creators from submitting NNS proposals
- Protects NNS voters from proposal overload, capping the amount of time and engagement required ( I don’t want to spend more than 30min-1hr a week thinking about the NNS, and I don’t want NNS spam proposal jury duty)


Some of the other proposals introducing thresholds are able to achieve these goals without increasing the NNS proposal creation cost. I’m not saying this current proposal wouldn’t work to reduce spam proposals, I’m just not in favor of the other side effects it would have on NNS proposal creation. I’d equate it to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

kusiyo | 2022-04-18 23:06:14 UTC | #52

Maybe the following voting rule is worthy of notice:
Let everyone choose a whole number between -100 and 100, and then calculate the weighted average:
![Screen Shot 2022-04-19 at 6.58.04 AM|690x97](upload://q0VqRG3sTnTMK7KLPwyHIWjeO0w.png)
where V is the total voting power, and V(n) is the total voting power acquired by the number n.
If you choose 100, it means you most strongly vote Yes; if you choose -100, it means you most strongly vote No; if you choose 0, it means you abstain.
The upper bound of adoption reward is 100 ICP, and the upper bound of rejection cost is also 100 ICP. That is, the rejection cost is completely up to the community depending on specific proposals.
In my opinion, the current Yes/No system is too brutal, and the suggested new voting rule allows people to reveal their full preferences more continuously.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-18 23:40:29 UTC | #53

I think its a cool idea, its basically a form of quadratic funding, but we need some form of proof of personhood before implementating such a system.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-18 23:46:33 UTC | #54

It increased the proposal preparation fee to 100icp

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-19 00:09:24 UTC | #55

Proof of personhood is really good here, but it is not a necessary condition for implementing this system.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-19 00:15:00 UTC | #56

Yes, but you may get 100 ICP if your proposal is really good. Rewarding people for submitting good proposals is very important for NNS, and I think it is possible to be a huge game for DAO: it incentives people to really participate in governance, and it could be a totally new game of crypto world after the NFT game.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-19 00:31:51 UTC | #59

Good, but I feel like 100 ICPs are too risky for many people

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-19 00:33:48 UTC | #60

100 ICP is only my first recommendation. This number can be determined by voting itself.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-19 01:05:42 UTC | #61

[quote="kusiyo, post:52, topic:12110"]

[/quote]

So now if I accidentally submit a proposal that isn’t ready or there’s a bug in the formatting that results in it having an empty body text I can be on the hook for 100 ICP…cool

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-19 01:22:27 UTC | #62

To be honest, I don’t see a serious problem here: 1) 100 ICP is only an upper bound, and it will generally be less than 100 ICP; 2) if you have made a mistake, the cost of your mistake will be determined by the community; 3) if you think it is not your fault, then maybe you can submit another proposal for getting your ICP back. That is the real beauty of NNS.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-19 01:30:10 UTC | #63

So then for making a mistake, we're relying on the time of thousands of NNS voters to now look at a new proposal that refunds a creator with ICP that has already been burned and decide whether it is worth passing or not. Keep in mind that this "correction" proposal for getting your ICP back is a new proposal that voters **have to** view and vote on (yes/no) in order to receive governance rewards.

<br/>

Some additional questions:

[quote="kusiyo, post:52, topic:12110"]

[/quote]

If the voters all choose 100 or we end up with a positive number, what happens with this adoption reward?

What happens if the user does not have a balance of 100 ICP and the proposal they submit gets a score of -100?

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-19 01:38:36 UTC | #64

I still don't see a serious problem here. 
The NNS is a global system, and every action should be taken seriously.
If the voters all choose 100, then this adoption reward should obviously be 100. You should understand the nature of collective voting in a totally different way: it is not personal choice, it is collective choice.
But maybe the Dfinity neuron can submit the "correction" proposal for you, if you can persuade the Dfinity neuron that it is indeed a system bug, not your fault.

For visibility (if this proposal is accepted), adding link to suggestion to change `Reject Cost` to `Spam Reject Cost` and get spam identified (>50% of votes) by a check box `Is Spam` (and cli opt `--is-spam` which defaults to `false`) in every proposal (or `Is Spam` button, I think similar was suggested by @Kyle_Langham).
- no cost of good-faith rejected proposal so encouraging serious proposers
- minimal administration overhead for governance - will be manageable also with SNS

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increase-proposal-rejection-cost/12110/37

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-19 10:00:58 UTC | #67

I really appreciate everybody's ideas here, but I want to stress the main point of this proposal again:

**Of all the ideas being discussed to reduce proposal spam, increasing the reject cost is the only change that does not require new code to be written and can be deployed immediately**. All other suggestions require engineering work and will therefore take much longer, while increasing the reject cost is simply changing a registry config value, which can happen immediately. @LightningLad91 has stated in this thread multiple times that he sees this as a temporary measure. 

The question is not whether you think this is the best way of addressing spam proposals or not, the question is whether you want the reject cost to be 1 ICP or 10 ICP while we're working on better solutions to reduce proposal spam. **If you'd rather have rejected proposals cost 10 ICP than 1 ICP today, then you should vote yes, even if you think that long-term there can be better solutions.**

-------------------------

codi0 | 2022-04-19 11:37:25 UTC | #68

I realise this is probably too late, since the proposal is already out.... but it should come with an expiry date. That way there's no chance that if it gets accepted, it remains.

This is clearly an emergency measure. It should be treated as such. After 3 months, if it is still required, re-propose, otherwise implement whatever better solutions have been come up with.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-19 14:07:49 UTC | #69

I would accept this proposal if it came with a 3 month expiry date at which point the rejection cost is reset to 1 ICP.

Should give adequate time to flush out more long term proposals and to see if we want to keep this measure in place or not

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-19 19:35:21 UTC | #70

If I had a way to implement an expiry date I promise I would. As @Manu stated above we are constrained by the capabilities of the NNS. The best I can do is uphold my promise to submit a proposal to lower it in the future

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-19 21:56:58 UTC | #71

I could be totally off base with this next comment, as I'm not as familiar with the root IC codebase as I would like to be.

When this governance proposal passes, someone from DFINITY will manually go in and update the proposal rejection cost, no? I did a little bit of digging and found this 
https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/c62b19ca875c17aa224ad6c0e744e6c7482860ef/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L160

If you look further, you'll see line 125 -> `const E8S_PER_ICPT: u64 = TOKEN_SUBDIVIDABLE_BY;`, and `TOKEN_SUBDIVIDABLE_BY` is defined in the ledger canister. I have no idea what E8s are, but its clear that at this point the reject cost in the code is defined in terms of 1 ICP. 

This means that someone will need to change line 160 of the file I linked from

```
reject_cost_e8s: E8S_PER_ICPT,
```
to
```
reject_cost_e8s: E8S_PER_ICPT * 10,
```


 won't happen the second when the vote is complete, but at some arbitrary time soon after when the change gets pushed through by an engineer.

If you put and expiry date in the proposal, then DFINITY would be obligated to reset the rejection cost (again manually) at that date in the future.


This is unless there's currently some mechanism in the IC repo code that allows a governance proposal itself to be appropriately configured with the specific wasm binary for updating the governance canister, such that when it passes, it makes that update.

@Manu or anyone else who's knowledgable on this, if there is such code in the IC, or an example/docs of how one might set up such a change for a proposal, can you point me to it? :slight_smile:

cryptoschindler | 2022-04-20 10:35:46 UTC | #72

Those notes were previously published on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptoschindler/status/1516330482480427009), but I was encouraged to post them here as well. 

> unpopular opinion: the NNS works perfectly fine and people are trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. increasing the threshold to submit a proposal to 10 ICP is excluding to a whole bunch of people around the world and in our ecosystem that don't have the resources to put this up. some people argued "hey if that proposal is nice i'm happy to sponsor it". but that's exactly the problem, your proposal shouldn't need to appeal to someone to allow it on the NNS. we don't need gatekeepers that decide what's allowed to be on and what not. 
people come up with all sorts of - sometimes more, sometimes less - complicated proposals that - most of the time - introduce some sort of centralisation of power and the ability to censor. in an ideal world everyone that locked their tokens is participating in governance and earn voting rewards, the game theory behind the NNS incentivises this. why isn't this the case right now? [@dfinity](https://twitter.com/dfinity) not only changed voting reward weights but at the same time disabled default following for proposals on the governance topic. this lead to a situation where a lot of neurons that previously followed the ICA and DFINITY on ALL topics suddenly stopped voting for governance proposals, with the change in voting reward weights this lead to  a significant loss in voting rewards for neurons. and also openend the door for the "spam" proposal "attack" we are seeing right now. the authors create a lot of governance proposals, which dwarf the rewards paid out for voting on other topics. this realtively big chunk of is only paid out to people that *actively* changed their follow targets for the governance topic. as a comparison: for recent exchange rate proposals 98% are in favor, this is a topic neuron holders still follow the foundation or ICA for by default.  for proposal 53420 that as recently rejected due to ALL know neurons voting NO, the voting power against was only 42%. this means that it's very likely that around 50% of the voting power for governance topics was "lost" due to the changes introduced by dfinity. this change was intended to further incentivise participation in governance and decentralising the network by taking voting power away from ICA and dfinity, which is great. instead of trying to stop people from creating those "spam" proposals, we should tackle the problem at the root, which is taking away the economic incentive to create them in the first place. if we had a +95% voting power participation for governance, you could of course still create those "spam" proposals, but they wouldn't benefit you and actually just cost you money. if you're happy with spending 1 ICP for shitposting, go ahead! so what is my proposed solution to this? education! [@dfinity](https://twitter.com/dfinity) is (imo) responsible of informing people in the broader ecosystem of this change. not everyone lurks in the forum and not everyone read the nns campaign put forward by [@BartlettWenzel](https://twitter.com/BartlettWenzel) and [@AI_ccp251th](https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th)
or constantly checks twitter. dfinity should finally step up to their responsibility and conclude an information campaign using all their outlets, email, twitter, youtube, community conversations and so on to try and reach as many people as possible. the nns works as intended, it economically incentivises people to participate in governance.

-------------------------

Manu | 2022-04-20 12:30:31 UTC | #73

1 e8 = 1 ICP * 10^-8. 

Yes, that value would need to be changed. We can actually change that via an NNS proposal, but it is a bit painful to submit such a proposal. If the motion proposal passes then DFINITY will submit that proposal, and I'd be happy to share the exact command used for that proposal (I don't know it off the top of my head).

-------------------------

throwawayacct | 2022-04-20 13:07:00 UTC | #74

I think dfinity as an association can serve as the first layer of defense for obvious spam proposals. It feels like a lot of energy is spent on finding "the best" way to deal with proposal trolls, instead of picking one that "just works" and move on.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-04-20 15:51:11 UTC | #75

The problem is that 10 ICP will likely, NOT, cut it. This is because the average voting power is ~4400.

 A cabal of determined adversaries (20+)can group together and make it financially viable decision to bear the rejection cost of 10 ICP. 

Any other mechanism will require coding changes that will take months to implement.

Accordingly a viable amount of rejection cost is 100 ICP.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-20 22:58:07 UTC | #76

If the whales keep funding the spams (and probably will because it is beneficial for them) and the 10 ICP prevent small investors from proposing because of the higher cost (some IC developper have already  wrote so), what will be the value you are talking about?
We have about 2 spams per day now.  Good chances we will keep having 2 per day at 10 ICP a piece but way less good proposal, almost none.
It has good chances to do exactly the reverse of the intention.
I understand it require almost no programming but brings no solution to me.
Weˋll see.

zire | 2022-04-21 13:51:33 UTC | #77

If somebody is really a whale, this extra yield from voting on spam proposals would be puny to them. If this extra yield is actually meaningful to them, he/she's not so much of a whale.

The proposals of the best quality shall win in the end on NNS. It has nothing to do with big or small investor status. There are many outlets for innovative ideas to be put forward and go through rigorous debates with community members, such as the developer forum, Twitter, Medium, DSCVR or Reddit. NNS does one thing only - voting. It's not for sourcing new ideas, debates or discussion.

-------------------------

zire | 2022-04-21 14:12:10 UTC | #78

10 ICP is about $200, give or take. It's an expensive steak meal with some wine. It's enough for an average Joe in the street to pause a second before walking into a Morton's and give him that sense of satisfaction when he receives $200 voucher at the end of the meal for being a loyal customer (so, he gets a free meal). At the same time, it's not so exceedingly extravagant that he'll just dismiss this idea all together outright. 

100 ICP would be $2000.  Mentally this is just too much for an average Joe. He would be so intimidated by the thought of walking into this Morton's that he would not even get out of the house.

mparikh | 2022-04-21 15:02:38 UTC | #80

I think about this in financial terms. If one spend 1 icp, is one getting 1.5 icp extra? In that case , it is worth it for someone. That cutoff point currently is at roughly 2400 icp locked for 8 years for that person.

Presumably such rational adversary would not spend 10 icp to get 1.5 extra icp.However he/she can collab with 10 other similar adversaries and spend only 1 icp ( even if the rejection cost is 10 icp) to get that 0.5 icp extra.

Finding 100 similar minded people would be difficult.

Manu | 2022-04-22 16:31:40 UTC | #81

This change has been made active with proposal [56214](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56214), so the reject cost is now 10 ICP.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-22 16:53:38 UTC | #82

How does this affect proposals that were created before the change, but are still live (voting has not yet concluded)

They are not affected, the reject cost is determined when the proposal is submitted.

[/quote]

I would like to respectfully disagree with this.  Before I do, I am not a whale, I am against spams proposals, I have no affiliation with @ysyms 

A whale with 605k ICP just crowdfunded 270 ICP to generate spams as per @ysyms proposal 56438. Within few hours, the spam project have received almost 66% of his goal (390 ICP of 600 goal).
I hope the community , including myself,  is learning from this.
To my opinion, some whales are investors only and are in only for the money, wich is OK with me.  They have the right to act like this. We cannot ignore those facts anymore while proposing. Interesting enough, this whale was voting to reject all spams and now, he fund them.  So it is proven now that spams proposals can be more than puny to them.
Numbers:  This whale (to my rough calculation) will earn 242 ICP every day, over 7500 ICP for the month.  What are 270 ICP to him to receive 7500 ICPs?  I guess that if some ICP will be missing to reach the 600, this same whale will add the necessary ICP to fulfil the crowdfunding.

For the second part, assuming all the best quality of proposals will pass.  Well, this same whale have good chances to prove otherwise.  The change from 1 to 10 ICPs for proposals is not stopping the spams and is making nervous some small investors to make good proposals, after all debate and everything. So that proposal have good chances to be proven not a good quality proposal while it has widely passed.

At same time, making the governance proposal weight at 20 make so much sense.  To me, a governance proposal worth much more then an exchange rate proposal.
And personally , a manual voting also worth more then a following vote.
So bring the governance back to weight 1, although it would stop the spams, is not a solution to me.
We have to remember that those spams are changing the distribution of ICP rewards but does not affect the supply, wich is a positive outcome (not negative at least).

The community should all work to achieve a simple, permanent and effective way to eliminate spams, where there would be any behavior trust.  There is no urgency to do things right, and permanent

This is only my opinion. not to tell anyone what to do,  and have no intent to say some people are right or wrong.

EDIT:  I feel we are lucky @ysyms is a white spammer and want to help the IC. He could propose 39 spams tomorrow if he wanted to but he make proposals on a much longer period of time while being active proposing some solutions.  Somehow, thank you @ysyms .  You will make IC a better system even more.  Those spams would have happenned anyway at some time, sooner or later.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-24 11:03:03 UTC | #85

I should add more numbers, as per the whale investor's view.
If we all think ICP will worth 1000$ in 5-7 years from now,
this whale would have invested 270,000$ (270 ICP) in order to gain 7.5 millions this month of May only.  Quiet a good investment.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-24 12:01:19 UTC | #86

I agree with everything you said here.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-24 12:28:18 UTC | #87

It is done now, 600 ICP. Only few hours needed to achieve the goal.
Another, smaller whale (39k), has contributed for the difference (209 ICP)
To a rough calculation, this will gain 460 ICP for a 209 spending.  Over 100% return.
Let's work wisely from there now.
I am amaze, but not surprise, how easy it was to do.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-24 13:51:45 UTC | #88

I want to acknowledge the points you make here @coteclaude. It's evident to me now that increasing the spam proposal cost to 10 ICP is not an effective spam deterrent. Furthermore, any additional increase would only serve to further harm the average stakeholder. I clearly made bad assumptions about what people would be willing to do to increase their rewards.

Speaking to others, it was pointed out that one benefit of the increased proposal rejection cost is that these spam proposals will result in 600+ ICP being burned over the next 30 days. It would be nice to know how the community feels about keeping the 10 ICP rejection cost if it results in more ICP being burned while spam proposals are still being submitted.

-------------------------

zire | 2022-04-24 13:56:03 UTC | #89

Your numbers might hold up. I trust that you've run the numbers and the yield to vote on spam proposals could be substantial for a whale under the current parameters. 

That said, as an ICP holder myself, I don't want to spend my time looking at spam. It's that simple. Time is my/our most precious asset. I don't want to deploy my most valuable assets looking at unprofessionally written and often pointless spam proposals. Yes, by voting on those proposals (regardless of Yes/No), I will also get extra return, but that's not important to me, like, at all. 

In crypto, people often get carried away when the yield numbers are stacked up. I find that at best a self-fulfilling prophecy and at worst a sad sad situation. Out of the 24 hours that we're blessed with, it's not hard to differentiate which hours are spent on value-adding activities where I'm actually making a contribution to advancing a technology innovation or building something larger than myself.

If you want that extra return, go for it and cast your votes to support all the spams. 

I want to create value for my constituency. Earning some extra yield while taxing my fellow ICP members collectively (in terms of time wasted) is irresponsible and not something I want to be part of.

While I admire many IC members' spirited effort in calculating whale's return in this whole spam thing to essentially drive home the notion that - this spamming is a financially sound effort for a whale, I also roll my eyes as I don't think whale's return should be a top priority for this community. Whales do whatever it is that whales do. I don't fantasize what is the next mansion that Gates will buy or whatever discount he may receive for buying a large piece of land in Montana. 

IC is for developers to change the world and here we are, talking at length about how much a whale can get if it were to vote on many spam proposals that have nothing to do with the underlying technology.

I think a combination of spam proposal filtering using randomly picked neurons and fixed weekly rewards as proposed here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915 is the best way to fix this issue.

In the past year the average price for submitting a proposal has been around 40-80$, so while I agree 1 ICP was too low for the current price in my opinion 10ICP is too high, it should have been set to a fixed value in cycles not higher than 100$

any additional increase would only serve to further harm the average stakeholder
[/quote]

How is the average stakeholder harmed if the proposal reject cost is increased further?

I’m not saying yet that I think this should happen, but the idea coupled with @ysyms current crowdfunding success does stimulate thought…

Why not increase the proposal reject fee to 30 ICP or higher?  Who does it harm given that it is expected to be a temporary solution as we wait a few months for implementation of a more permanent solution?  

I think it only harms the profits of the few whales who are willing to fund it.  So why not make it more expensive for these few whales?  Why not create a crowdfunding rug pull opportunity for @ysyms?  If he did walk away, it wouldn’t be with ICP from the average investor because they are not the ones funding it.  In fact, the average investor can’t afford to fund it because the cost already outweighs the gain for the average investor.  

If @ysyms executes the plan they created, then several things will happen:
1) everyone who is currently participating in governance proposals gets higher rewards
2) everyone who is not currently participating in governance proposals can still start increasing  their rewards by starting to vote.
3) the whales who funded the effort will get slightly less return than they did when the proposal reject cost was only 1 ICP and @ysyms was willing to fund it himself.

If @ysyms rugs, then only the whales who funded the crowdfund will loose.

If you increase the proposal reject fee, then you create fewer spam proposals with the funds already collected.  It will require additional crowdfund to keep it going.  Whales will continue to bear the cost of the crowdfund while everyone benefits from execution of the plan and the risk of rug only goes up.  If there is no further crowdfunding effort, then you can decrease the proposal reject fee after the funds run dry.

@ysyms is an enterprising young high school student (self proclaimed) who has already raised $10,000.  Why not give him the opportunity to raise $30,000 from the whales?  If he succeed, then why not up the ante to $50,000 or $250,000.  At some point the cost to the whales is too much and the risk of rug is too great.  Only the whales who fund these shenanigans would be hurt, but if @ysyms maintains integrity and executes the plan then everyone wins (except decreasing profits for the funding whales).

Again, this is temporary as we wait for the issue to be addressed by proposal [55641](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) (or some other alternative).  If anyone else has a genuine proposal they want to submit, it should have value at 10 ICP, 30 ICP, or higher just like it does at 1 ICP.  The cost is only a cost if the proposal is rejected.  The proposer is responsible for presenting something to the NNS that has a high probability of success, so the higher proposal reject fee only serves to ensure that the proposer is doing their due diligence to ensure there is low risk of rejection.  

Borrowing from @ysyms crowdfunding idea, what is wrong with genuine community proposals getting funded by the whales?  A higher proposal reject fee might actually incentivize more people to make genuine proposals because they get to keep the fee if it is an accepted proposal.  Perhaps these same whales would be more than happy to fund a genuine community proposal if they know it is likely to be passed instead of guaranteed rejection.  Every person who wants to make a proposal for some topic they believe in could include a proposal funding address during deliberation on the forum.  If it is funded, then perhaps it is a valid proposal that should be submitted to the NNS.

This post is really just a stream of consciousness for me right now.  I’m not saying the proposal reject fee should be increased at this time, but I don’t think the idea should be rejected before giving it more thought.  There could be a lot more benefit than we’ve considered so far.

So the right to speak is only given to those who can afford it? The temporary solutions become permanent really quickly. 

First we start out with 1 to 10 ICPs ( still promising "it's a temporary fix")...that doesn’t work, so now let's make it 30 ("it's a a temporary fix") with the added promise that if 30 doesn't work, let's make it 100 ("it's still a temporary fix").


If we believe that non-active participants should be penalized in favor of active participants,  isn't that exactly what is happening? 

The real issue that increasing the governance proposal score created an imbalance that the astute are exploiting. We should readily admit that that (increasing the governance proposal score) was a mistake IF we did not want to penalize non-active participants.

skilesare | 2022-04-24 17:35:17 UTC | #96

10 ICP is already too high for ICDevs to submit regular proposals for active debate.  We are raiding funds already: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-temporarily-reduce-governance-proposal-weight-to-1/12390

But maybe it is a new fundraising avenue!

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-24 17:36:45 UTC | #97

I agree, we should all beware of temporary changes, moving away from the gold standard was supposed to be a temporary thing too, we all know how that turned out.

NNS Proposal = Right to Speak  
@mparikh 
Is it that simple?  Is it the purpose of the NNS proposal to give everyone a voice that they cannot express unless they submit a proposal?

Interestingly, @skilesare has already started a [new proposal discussion to remove proposal weights](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-temporarily-reduce-governance-proposal-weight-to-1/12390?u=wpb) and guess how he is trying to fund it?  Crowdsourcing.  I wonder how difficult it will be for him to fund that proposal.  If the proposal rejection fee were 30 ICP, I wonder if he would have a more difficult time raising the funds for him to submit that proposal.

I would argue that the utility of NNS proposals is not simple free speech.  I would also argue that higher proposal reject fees do not prevent good proposal from getting submitted to the NNS.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-24 19:19:44 UTC | #99

Purely subjective on my part. I think $160 - $250 is a reasonable rejection cost that will cause more proposers to seek community support before submitting to the NNS. I do not think $600+ Would do anything more than prevent people from trying all together.

We are killing the democracy. Really. And we are making the IC look like suffering of an earthquake  

I was strongly against the increasing of rejection fees, because : 
- it would kill the spontaneity of little bags to submit proposals : what about a little genius, without money who would have a brilliant idea, what about Ramanujan ?
- more importantly, we don’t see that with a so called « short term solution » waiting for a long term solution, we are also creating a long term problem : each time we are making a modification, we are creating instability, notably in investors’ confidence. Each time, we lose some investors’ confidence, because each such modification makes some investors feel : « this blockchain is unstable, they change networks economics a lot, I don’t know what will look like the tokenomics even one week after I invested in ». For instance, to whoever who would say « we don’t care about investors, icp is for dev and enthusiasts etc », I am a fanatic of this blockchain, however, I am starting to be afraid by the happening direction : I am wondering « where will be the ICP in 6 months with such a rhythm of such proposals ? » and whereas I have already been almost all in ICP, I have started to slow down. What about the average investor who does not even read the white paper ?

By ignoring the butterfly effect of these modifications, we are threatening the integrity of the whole blockchain. We brought some modification very - too - soon to ICP, the inefficiency of this modification is being proven, and rather than learn the lesson, we are considering an iteration. Where is the limit ? Why 30 icp rather than 60, 90, 120 ? Rather  than saying « maybe we should remove the difference of weight », we think about going to iterate the last inefficient modification to make it finally efficient. But it will never be. Let us think about the poor dev, the genius dev. I am a researcher, and some of the most brilliant spirits I met were poor people. And even a genius won’t take his chance to lose 10 icp, because he can’t afford because even the most brilliant idea is not assured to be accepted, because it is a democracy where everybody vote. Must I remind that a brilliant idea is not necessary recognized as a brilliant idea ? What about the scientists we wanted to burn when they said that the planet earth was round rather than flat ? And about the fact that 10 icp today have the same value that 1 icp in may 2021, Dfinity never said « the rejection fees will be 1 icp as long as 1 icp will be equal to 200 dollars ». We were not supposed to do such maths.

So, I am very inconfortable with what I am feeling like a frenzy of modifications, whereas I am an early fan. I don’t say that ICP must not be changed, but with parsimony. I think we should give some space to the ICP currently. Really. Let us slow down. Because by saying that the increasing of rejection cost would be a short term solution before finding a long term one, we did not see that it could also bring some long term problems. And by not seeing this, we are ready to repeat the mistake.

I want to know why 27 and 28 can openly violate the resolution in the previous proposal not to vote on the governance proposal? Does the proposed decision not bind the foundation? In addition, if this proposal is approved, I hope to raise 10icp in our community to form a garbage proposal. The purpose is to tell you that this solution is absurd.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-24 19:56:54 UTC | #102

Agreed - The more we increase the rejection cost, the more we centralize control over who can submit to the NNS (based off of the existing voting power and influence of the submitter). 

Let's forget spam for a second.

Why is @ysyms able to submit proposals? -> because he was crowdfunded by whales.
Why is @wpb able to submit proposals? -> because he was an early investor, has enormous influence in the community, and I would assume ICMaxis is sitting on a pile of ICP.

Many others, even @skilesare has highlighted the reject cost is making him think twice about submitting proposals. And he should...why should ICDevs have to choose between spending 10 ICP to fund an independent developer bounty vs. a governance proposal? There's a good chance his proposal gets rejected, as it took over 3 times just to be recognized as a known neuron, vs. one time for Cycle Dao and Maxis.

If anything, this successful crowdfunding effort shows that we have reached step one in the unintended consequences of this proposal passing that I mentioned here.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:49, topic:12049"]
1. Once this reject cost proposal change is made (I think it was executed), we won’t see many new governance proposals for awhile, except by larger, centralized organizations that are willing to take the risk like Maxis, cycle_dao, and maybe IC_Devs. These organizations may act as gatekeepers, offering to foot some of the bill for a proposal if they approve of it or earmark features in it.
[/quote]

This only highlights the importance of the community supporting proposals that have allowed for adequate time to receive and address critical feedback, think about edge cases scenarios, and iterate upon those flaws -> not proposals that in a rush or have a deadline (to push out a fix). 

There were many great ideas being discussed and finalized as a result of the leadership that @wpb and @Kyle_Langham showed in organizing the community, but now many of these ideas will not be submitted to the NNS due to the increased proposal reject cost. 

I think everyone was 100% well intentioned in moving as quick to ideate and vote as they did, and I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I hope this is a learning point going forward.

I think these are all bad assumptions. I don’t believe @wpb is in any better position than myself or anyone else who started investing at Genesis when ICP was $600

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-24 20:12:46 UTC | #104

Totally fair, and I apologize if these assumptions are off base. 

@Kyle_Langham Do you have any data on how much voting power each of the big independently named organizations/neurons hold? (Maxis, Cycle Dao, ICDevs).

If those organizations want to volunteer that information in the spirit of transparency, that would be great as well.
