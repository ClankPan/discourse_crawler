Because control of the cycle_dao neuron has been transferred to Arthur Falls, a proposal will soon be submitted to change the name of the neuron to "Arthur's Neuron (used to be cycle_dao)"

The description will be the following: 
"This neuron used to be controlled by cycle_dao. It is now controlled by an individual, Arthur Falls. It will vote on all proposals. Subjects of concern for the controller are protocol stability, healthy economics, token holder rights, node provider incentivisation, better governance, DFINITY accountability, and DFINITY non-participation in the application layer."

This is intended to reflect the flexibility of a personally controlled named neuron rather than act as a policy document or constitution.
