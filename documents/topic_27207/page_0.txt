I've been receiving low amounts of maturity compared to what I've previously experienced and what the dashboard indicates I should receive. I refrained from saying anything online as I expected the solution to present itself to me naturally. 

Today I realised that in the NNS dapp where I vote manually and daily, I hadn't selected all the voting topics that are available; hence not showing all proposals available to me. 

Upon ticking, all proposals are now visible and I will now be able to participate in all rewards.
