Same principle: neuron management via threshold voting, just uses a different setup of followee neurons since it's more security-critical and less time-sensitive.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-15 16:26:46 UTC | #103

Is it still in the plans to make neuron management via threshold voting possible through the NNS dApp?  When do you think that feature will be available?

@Maria can you have a look at [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/committee-neurons/14848/103) question?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-15 18:22:28 UTC | #105

As I've been contemplating the responses and talking this out with a few people, I think I can boil down the main benefits of committee neurons as proposed here over the current system like this: committee neurons allow the community to enforce certain properties of decentralization.

For example, with known neurons and following as is, we are hoping to achieve sufficient levels of decentralization when it comes to voting on the roadmap and code changes to the protocol. We may end up with what we want, but there is less of a guarantee. With committee neurons, we can enforce a minimum and maximum level of decentralization necessary before proposals pass. I'm not saying this is the only way to do it, but it is one way.

This feels very similar to the differences between Ethereum's decentralization properties and the IC's (for subnets or consensus). Ethereum has designed for a protocol that is optimistically decentralized. The IC has protocols that can be made to be decentralized, by controlling the size and composition of subnets. Ethereum has the upper-hand in a proven track record of sufficient decentralization. On the IC we do not yet know if we have a protocol that will be sufficiently decentralized for our needs.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-15 18:24:37 UTC | #106

With that thinking in mind, perhaps the next incremental step towards decentralization is just figuring out how to get more specialized neurons with sufficient followers to vote on various proposal topics, especially the replica code.

Incentives may be key.

My counter argument:

Point #1:
" Representative democracy can succeed and work well unless the structure hosting it is already corrupt itself. Just because something fails sometimes, that doesn’t mean all aspects or iterations of it are inherently flawed." 
==> History has proven by past decades (or centuries) that structure hosting is always corrupt in the end. Yes, there were successfully representative democracy in the history, but they didn't last long and not sustainable.

"By contrast, no one has ever been able to run something more complex than MakerDAO (which essentially only needs to set interest rates) using current Web3 DAO structures. We simply do not have a way to run a large complex organization (a company like Samsung for example) with direct vote public poles or the standard web3 DAO structures".
==> If we think we do not have a way to run a large complex organization with direct public vote, then we need to invent & innovate one. 
If we believe that ICP communities are the agent of change & want to fix what has broken in current democracy system, we should not iterate it again or we may face the same problems.

Point #2:
"Crowd objectiveness is also easily steered by digital ads, the media, and famous people. Mobs can be just as stupid and corrupt as individuals, if not more so".

==> This is the narratives sold by the establishment, so they can stay in power. The establishment owns the digital ads, media & able to pay famous people. Crowd objectiveness is easily steered because they are fed the with false information, true information is censored.
Yes, we see crowd / people make silly decision, but they are learning from their mistakes & become smarter.  Liquid democracy & direct vote system is still in infancy stage, but it is maturing day by day. The issue is, do you want to give liquid democracy a chance to be successful, of kill it while it is still young? What we have to do is to educate people to be more responsible with their life, aware of their rights and exercise it to take their own self sovereignty instead of just being ignorant.

Point #3:
" I think new accountability mechanisms which can automatically remove bad representatives at the protocol level will be crucial! However, at least individuals can have competency, any competencies within a crowd tends to get drowned out by noise".

==> New accountability mechanism to auto-remove bad representatives at protocol level, does not negate the "illusion of control" ( cognitive bias that causes people to believe they have control over their decision than they actually do. Illusion of control is  the same advertising and marketing trick to make people feel like they are in control of their decisions). New elected representative in power is no guarantee not doing the same malicious acts.

"Mobs are not good at making decisions on very complex topics which require experience, knowledge, and skill."
==> This is why we need is more experts neurons to help make the decision, the technical & complex decision should not be made by just several representatives.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-08-16 08:16:13 UTC | #109

FWIW, Switzerland is an example of a [semi-direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland) with voters regularly deciding on factual and actually complex matters (in addition to electing representatives). There have been cases where voters have been lead astray by populists and public decisions have been bananas, but all in all it seems to work reasonably well, so maybe there's some patterns to be learned.

Before each referendum (i.e. public vote), voters receive a leaflet that contains arguments from both sides along with some background information, so they can make up their mind or at least have a starting point for deeper research. Of course experts and partisans are involved in that process as well (someone has to produce the leaflet), but in the end it's the public vote that decides.

What I find interesting about the above is that it somehow inverts the process (experts/... inform, public votes vs. public elects, experts/... decide).

-------------------------

MrPink13 | 2022-08-17 06:47:57 UTC | #110

I am adamantly against having elected representative neurons. I am against anything that gives any sort of individual inherent power and incentive to wield that power.

The current named neuron system works, it just needs time to get up and running. Named neurons will organically flourish and die over time or thrive depending on their ability to provide expert opinion or at the very least sway public opinion.

We just need some sort of hub or place where named neurons can pitch themselves and express their intend/voting opinions to the community that isn't twitter. 

The IC looks like a mess right now because it is, this is what the beginning of decentralization looks like, a messy stringy web that is trying to connect itself.

We just need to keep connecting the dots, keep connecting as a community and build that strong interconnected foundation to fully uphold our utopian decentralized vision. Lets not give up yet.

NNS governance has been plagued with a number of issues in its first year of existence. It’s generally unorganized and ineffective in various ways.
[/quote]

@lastmjs I want to challenge the sentence quoted as an opening sentence (without any caveats) because I suspect what I am reading is not truly representative of your intent. I think what you wrote is much harsher than what you believe, and certainly more than I believe. I myself did not see a harsh in until some folks DM'd me that "Jordan thinks NNS is trash!", which is not my experience from the looooong conversation we have all been having in this forum across many topics.

**In fact, I believe that the core function of the NNS is quite good: on-chain updates (which are visible to community) to the network which gives token holders power to update the protocol coupled with liquid democracy so people can delegate appropriately to experts where they wish.** 

I also believe that when you write "*With just a few key changes to the NNS, this proposal seeks to address..."* you believe the NNS has a solid foundation to build from and your proposal is an iteration or improvement.

Now when you write that sentence, I (mostly) know what you are referring too because I have been part of many conversations related to governace, but I think many new entrants do not. As someone we all respect in the community, would you consider giving proper context by laying out where you think NNS does well? Alas, we are in crypto world where people sometimes just read 1 sentence in 1 post.... they do not have the history or context.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-17 13:53:54 UTC | #112

Ah yes, I will do that...hmmm... difficult to navigate this because there is so much previous context. I will keep this in mind in the future and will fix up the original post.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-17 14:08:07 UTC | #113

I've updated the introduction, but I want to be careful not to censor myself too much here. I believe the NNS has been generally disorganized and ineffective if you consider its core purpose to be decentralized governance.

If you consider its core purpose to be secure and safe upgrades to the protocol, then I think it has been functioning quite well. But that is only because DFINITY effectively controls adopting or rejecting all proposals to the core protocol.

As a community I think we have a shared belief that centralized power will not lead to security over the long run or in the vast variety of trying circumstances we may find ourselves in as human beings. Thus we need to decentralize the NNS in order for it to achieve its long-term purpose.

So, I think people should consider the harsh reality of the situation. I want my words to be true, but if they're harsh and someone doesn't take any more time to understand the situation, I'm not really sure what to do about that. I also never want to be harmful to another human being, so if that's what's happening please let me know.

[quote="lastmjs, post:1, topic:14848"]
The NNS is a fascinating experiment in decentralized governance of an entire stateful protocol stack. It has introduced a number of building block mechanisms that we have been able to use to effectively deploy and upgrade the IC protocol stack. The practical reality of the NNS is not perfect though, especially when it comes to real decentralization, and I believe we should continue to fight to improve it.

When it comes to decentralized decision making and upgrades to the protocol, NNS governance has had a number of issues in its first year of existence, including general disorganization and ineffectiveness. I think this stems from a few reasons, including that for most material aspects (like updates to the actual protocol itself), it is controlled by one party (DFINITY) that cannot actually be controlled directly by the NNS.
[/quote]

@diegop here we go, I feel a lot better about this. The building blocks are there, they aren't perfect, they are working, but they haven't yet brought us to real practical decentralized decision making that can set a vision and actually deploy and/or review code changes. That's what I want to improve.

But here’s the thing - DFINITY didn’t need to build the entire NNS if they just needed secure, safe, and visible updates to the protocol that only they control (centralized). The potential of the NNS is so much more than just safe protocol upgrades, but none of that potential has been tapped this far.

Currently, for those not affiliated with DFINITY, the NNS is a glorified polling machine that locks up capital with the promise of future returns on that capital in exchange for more voting power in those polls. 

Until neurons independently vote on and/or contribute new protocol/replica updates, it will remain this way.

Is that the fault of DFINITY, the community, or is the fault shared between both parties that we still don’t have any neurons that vote on protocol or replica level changes?

@diegop, I agree with you on this point!

However, why do you think the community has been so slow to involve themselves in the process of voting at the replica and protocol level, and do you think DFINITY could do a better job of encouraging neurons to vote independently on these topics?

The community obviously has to step up, but what steps can DFINITY take to make this process easier for us?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-18 00:17:09 UTC | #116

I would imagine it is because the community is incapable of doing so. Wouldn't we need a sister foundation (or many) with world class cryptographers to check the work of other world class cryptographers? Not sure folks doing this on the side is going to cut it. LMK if you disagree (I am not a dev so am just guessing).

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-08-18 00:44:06 UTC | #117

I agree with your assessment that the community has not stepped up because it cannot, either in terms of expertise, time, or both.

I don't know the answer to this besides a way to incentivize / reward contributors.

-------------------------

Mike1 | 2022-08-18 06:33:21 UTC | #119

Thanks for the great suggestion, but I have two questions to ask:

Q1. The emergence of the committee neuron mechanism may break the current Neuron governance system. For example, when C-Neuron makes a voting decision, it can unilaterally approve or reject the proposal. For those Neuron who have pledged ICP Token to obtain voting rights In other words, this will be a mandatory governance behavior? Then this is equivalent to a centralized mechanism. I don't know if the committee structure in my eyes is as I understand it. If I understand it wrong, please correct me.

Q2. Can we decentralize the governance power of C-Neuron

Because C-Neuron and M-Neuron have specialized knowledge in a certain area, they can set up a public social media channel to write a blog of the impact of a topic proposal in the early stages of submission to NNS governance , so that more ordinary Neurons can make reasonable governance decisions.

For C-Neuron's governance voting rights, I think it is still unreasonable for C-Neuron to have absolute governance decisions, and we should lower C-Neuron's governance rights, for example, when the proposal life cycle reaches half or at least the above stage , granting C-Neuron only has 30% or 40% of the total voting power of the proposal, in short, it cannot exceed 50%.

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-08-21 17:10:12 UTC | #120

I got into this project and staked for 8 years, 8 yr dissolve delay with the mindset of never pressing dissolve but using the staking rewards for income once price way way higher. I am not willing to take less rewards for someone else to get more. I contribuye alot of my time everday in promoting ICP. Those who want to also put in time they are welcome too but not at the expense of stakeholders. Its to every stakeholders benefit to do as much as they can to forward the project.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-22 08:24:51 UTC | #121

What is being suggested is that experts outside Dfinity vet code carefully, regularly and frequently. Contributing time is one thing, and contributing expertise another. If their expertise is not compensated up-front, experts will find other avenues to make money using the same amount of time. Their expertise is valuable, it literally has a price attached. The number of experts required for these proposed committees will be very small compared to the total number of ICP holders and therefore the cost to each holder relatively small as well.
The benefit is the creation of a pool of expertise outside Dfinity committed to maintaining the security of the network. Without such a pool, Dfinity will forever be the sole arbiter of the IC, which is bad for decentralization. Since greater decentralization helps the reputation of the network, which is crucial for its long-term price, the idea is that expert committees will help the price in the long-term, far outweighing the notional loss suffered by individuals by way of slightly reduced rewards. 
Obviously nobody is going to accept a proposal that would lead to long-term personal losses. Everybody is interested in maximising long-term gains.

-------------------------

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-08-22 13:20:55 UTC | #122

That makes sense and i would be on board with paying in ICP. i would rather the ICP come from new issues, though, rather than reduce the staking pool as the staking pool was promisses to stakeholders and the reason i locked up so much money for 8 years, 8 yr dissolve and never going to start dissolve because of the attravtive staking rewards. I love and believe in the project but it was the great staking rewards program that got me to lock up my tokens as I did. I dont think we should worrry about the extra dilution as we should all be in this for the long term and if the project will be successful/we get, somewhat,  mass adoption, the future ICP to be burned will be so much greater than aall issued that i dont mind taking the hit in the short term. I will either keep merging my rewards or stacking them up on the side and wait a little longer.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-22 14:01:09 UTC | #123

My feeling, expressed upthread, is that it would set a bad precedent to mint new ICP at a time when burn rates are low, inflation rates high, and the reputation of the network poor. Even if the actual amount of new ICP created is minimal, the further harm to reputation could be severe. 
But I see your point as well, stakers locked up money based on certain assumptions and deserve to have commitments kept. If the proposal goes further, we will get a sense of how much ICP will be involved and can take a more informed decision at that point.

-------------------------

KennyBoyNYC | 2022-08-22 15:01:22 UTC | #124

Sounds good. Thank you.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-25 03:29:13 UTC | #125

@KennyBoyNYC , please check out the proposal to reduce minimum staking time.The proposal is nearly final. It will reduce the APY of current stakers, something you are dead set against.

A lot has changed since you started this conversation.  We now have [proposal topic 13](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/24d6dd7cc9d757993901abfc56deb00c7ceb380b/rs/nns/governance/proto/ic_nns_governance/pb/v1/governance.proto#L105) - Replica Version Management.  It is a new proposal topic intended to enable more people in the community to get more involved in blessing replica versions.  DFINITY has been waiting 3-4 days to vote on the Bless Replica Version proposal type to give the community time to review.  People are starting to talk about getting more involved in voting manually on replica updates.

There are folks like @christian who are starting to manually vote on this proposal topic as he describes in his post today on [Taggr](https://share.taggr.link/post/11663).

Also, @bjoern and @Manu have been advocating for manual voting and teaching the community how to do it on DSCVR in the [Voting Challenge portal](https://dscvr.one/p/voting-challenge).

I would love to develop a list of people who are performing this type of work.  I still think it will require incentives to convince people to perform this work reliably enough to become a viable Followee selection, but perhaps it's a start if we spread the word and start finding out who is interested.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-12-31 15:52:05 UTC | #129

Very good idea, my team and I will discuss this next week. We might start manually voting in this topic, doing some kind of general review of the changelog and the source code. It would at least be a start.
