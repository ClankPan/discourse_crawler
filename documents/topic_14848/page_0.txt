This is an initial idea for an upgrade to the governance system of the NNS. I invite feedback of all kinds.

# TLDR

Introduce a new type of neuron known as a committee neuron. Committee neurons are controlled by member neurons and have unilateral power to adopt or reject proposals of specific topics. Committee neurons are created and dissolved by the NNS. Member neurons are added and removed from committee neurons by the NNS. I recommend two specific committee neurons to start with, the Roadmap Committee Neuron and the Replica Committee Neuron.

# Introduction

The NNS is a fascinating experiment in decentralized governance of an entire stateful protocol stack. It has introduced a number of building block mechanisms that we have been able to use to effectively deploy and upgrade the IC protocol stack. The practical reality of the NNS is not perfect though, especially when it comes to real decentralization, and I believe we should continue to fight to improve it.

When it comes to decentralized decision making and upgrades to the protocol, NNS governance has had a number of issues in its first year of existence, including general disorganization and ineffectiveness. I think this stems from a few reasons, including that for most material aspects (like updates to the actual protocol itself), it is controlled by one party (DFINITY) that cannot actually be controlled directly by the NNS.

With just a few key changes to the NNS, this proposal seeks to address those issues by harnessing the decision-making efficiency and effectiveness of smaller groups of expert leaders, while providing the means to prevent those leaders from abusing their positions of influence and power. It basically introduces a concrete form of representative democracy, as opposed to the pure liquid democracy currently in effect.

I would like to emphasize the simplicity of this design. The material change here is a new neuron type with some new parameters and functionality.

# Committee Neurons

A new type of neuron is introduced, known as a committee neuron (c-neuron). C-neurons are controlled by a number of other neurons, known as member neurons (m-neurons). C-neurons can only vote on one proposal topic, and there can only be one c-neuron assigned per topic. If a c-neuron votes yes on a proposal, the proposal is automatically adopted. If a c-neuron votes no on a proposal, the proposal is automatically rejected.

## C-neuron Creation

The NNS controls the creation and dissolution of all c-neurons. A new proposal type can be created to facilitate this.

## C-neuron Membership

Once a c-neuron is created, the NNS can start to vote member neurons into it. This will be done through proposals similar to named neurons. Each c-neuron can have a limit to its size, or the size can be limited by the willingness of the NNS to vote new members into it, or to remove members. Member neurons can be removed by the NNS at any time.

There can also be a time limit for membership in a c-neuron. For example, an initial time limit set by the NNS could be 6 months. Once an m-neuron becomes a member of a c-neuron, the term begins. Once the term of the m-neuron exceeds the predetermined time limit, the m-neuron can be automatically removed. The m-neuron could then be voted back into the c-neuron or not, according to the desires of the m-neuron owner and the NNS.

## C-neuron Voting

A c-neuron vote is cast when a predetermined threshold of its m-neurons internally vote yes or no on a proposal. The predetermined threshold is set by the NNS. When a c-neuron votes, a proposal is automatically adopted or rejected.

## C-neuron Compensation

Considering that m-neurons will have to dedicate a material amount of time to their duties within the c-neuron, greater compensation than the standard voting rewards may be useful or necessary. This compensation could be a fixed amount, like a salary, or could simply be an increased staking rewards rate for the m-neurons. New inflation could be introduced, or these rewards could come out of the current rewards pie, effectively reducing the rewards of all NNS members. This could serve as a check on the community, incentivizing them to carefully consider how many committees and how many members should serve in them, since there would be real costs to them individually.

# Types of Committee Neurons

I am imagining the NNS wanting to create various types of c-neurons. The point of each c-neuron is to be specialized, allowing a diverse but effective group of experts to unilaterally make progress. I propose two types of c-neurons to begin with.

## Roadmap Committee Neuron

The roadmap c-neuron votes on the direction of the protocol. It would set the vision for all other c-neurons to follow. This c-neuron would be a check on all other c-neurons, as if the other c-neurons do not follow the roadmap c-neuron, then the NNS could work to rearrange the memberships of those c-neurons. And as stated above, this c-neuron could be as large or small and as diverse as they NNS community desires.

# Replica Committee Neuron

Considering that the replica code is the most vital and security-sensitive part of the entire IC ecosystem, the greatest care should be taken to ensure that updates to its code are safe and secure. The replica c-neuron members would be tasked with reviewing all code changes, and also not allowing anything into the replica that was not in line with the roadmap set by the roadmap c-neuron.

Especially at this time, almost little else matters in on-chain governance than the replica's code. It's unilaterally controlled by DFINITY at this point in time. Having a c-neuron control the code would even provide a check on DFINITY, as though they could work on whatever they wanted, the replica c-neuron should not allow changes through that are not in line with the proposals passed by the roadmap c-neuron.

## System Canister Committee Neurons

You could imagine c-neurons for each of the designated system canisters. These c-neurons would be tasked with reviewing the code for each update to each system canister. They would provide a check on DFINITY or any other party attempting to push changes to the system canisters not in line with the roadmap, or malicious in nature.

# Final Remarks

I believe that our simple liquid democracy does not have the mechanisms necessary to move the IC forward in an effective yet decentralized manner. We need to centralize some decision-making and execution, while still providing the wider NNS community recourse when those in power abuse their power. I think committee neurons provide one interesting implementation of a step in the right direction.

I think this is an excellent proposal. There are two responses I have to it. First, it is to my mind absolutely essential that any extra rewards are taken from the existing pie and not from additional inflation. Inflation is currently very high and compensatory burning very low. It would send a terrible signal to increase the rewards pie right now.
A more minor issue involves nomenclature. I would prefer something like 'council neuron' to 'committee neuron' because, although committees are sometimes elected, they are usually appointed. 'Council' has a more democratic feel than 'committee' which seems bureaucratic.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-13 17:12:49 UTC | #3

Very excellent feedback, I especially lean towards your line of thinking on the rewards.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-13 17:54:25 UTC | #4

@lastmjs , I should add that it is crucial members voted into committees / councils be paid as you suggest. The fate of Cycle Dao of which I believe you were briefly a member shows what happens when people are doing stuff pro-bono. The burden lands on one or two shoulders and ultimately they just give up. Since increasing inflation will be a deal-breaker for many (me included), the only way forward is for the rest of us to sacrifice some of our rewards. I think that would be acceptable provided the number of members stays manageable and high quality.

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-08-13 20:02:56 UTC | #5

@lastmjs the way this is worded suggests to me that there can only be one c-neuron per proposal topic. Is that intentional?

I’m not sure there’s any benefit to having multiple c-neurons for the same topic, so it would probably just create unnecessary overhead.

In any case it might be worth clarifying that explicitly.

-------------------------

Gekctek | 2022-08-13 20:17:17 UTC | #6

While i like the idea of innovating on governance, i am hesitant to have rule by single council. 
I think liquid democracy is super powerful to where a web of trust is built and can be easily modified at anytime. No elections, no required parties, no limit on how many representatives there are. That being said your proposal doesn't get rid of done of those features, just constrains it a bit 
That being said, there are problems with the current system to where anyone can vote on anything while having no idea what it means or the consequences. They can also just follow some influencer or populist that is also just as in the dark. 
I think the main problem I have with the proposal if I understand correctly is that 1) there is 1 group to decide on a topic and 2) to get into that one group you have to be elected via nns. My concern is that an average person won't know who these people are unless we have very structured parties and election systems. With liquid democracy I'm able to trust my neighbor whom I know and agree with and my neighbor is more knowledgeable than I am in a certain topic. 
The idea of people having to campaign to have people know where they stand and who they are and how trustworthy they are doesn't sit well with me. I think we need to be able to choose people that we know we trust versus having a small set of people try to convince us that they can be trusted.
Maybe there's a middle ground between the two but the way I've been thinking about it is if you want some sort of party or counsel to vote for us then that should be handled through a DAO system rather than the nns.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-13 20:36:51 UTC | #7

I'm not sure I understand the critique here. I'm suggesting that you have one c-neuron be focused on one type of proposal, yes. The roadmap c-neuron will only focus on the roadmap. The replica code neuron will only focus on the replica code. They will be direct and targeted and independent of each other (unless someone is elected into multiple c-neurons).

I may have an idea to solve this problem. Instead of a direct election with an explicit proposal, perhaps you just follow people for certain c-neurons. If enough people follow you for a specific c-neuron then you automatically become a member of the c-neuron...or at least have the option of joining the c-neuron.

What do you think? This makes it even more liquid, because people can instantly unfollow at any time and thus change the membership of the c-neurons without having to go through the proposal process.

> If a c-neuron votes yes on a proposal, the proposal is automatically adopted.

I’m saying; things like the above imply “there can only be one c-neuron per topic” but it’s not explicitly stated as such.

For example, if a roadmap c-neuron already exists is there anything to prevent people from voting to create another roadmap c-neuron with different members?

Imagine the case that this proposal after several months of deliberation is accepted, the necessary resources allocated and after many more development months it is finally implemented. Then, let's imagine it comes a second proposal asking to revert all changes and comeback to the initial governance system. How do we prevent a continuous change of fundamental governance rules? Perhaps we should define some kind of meta-governance with much higher acceptance requirements (e.g. 95% yes to accept) and much higher rejection cost (10000 ICP). This meta-governance should be slow, just like you dont change the constitution of a country every mandate, and it should still be mutable if enough consensus.

-------------------------

nicko | 2022-08-13 21:23:29 UTC | #13

I have been planning to set up an ethics committee for nuance and eventually, the committee would create a neuron where others could delegate their vote on ethics matters. But the membership of the committee itself was all off-chain. This seems to bring that part on-chain which sounds pretty cool!

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-13 21:22:04 UTC | #14

Before proposing solutions, I think its first important to discuss the problems we see with the existing structure of ICP governance. Once we are all clear on the issues we have then it'll be easier to brainstorm solutions. Here are the issues as you have described them. 

**Problems with IC Governance** 

1. **Replica Code:** No one outside of Dfinity checking and confirming the replica code is safe and secure. That is clear.  

2.  **Experts:** We need experts to be voting on certain topics. Some people are not qualified to be voting on technical topics. For example, I was asked to vote on the token standard as a voting member of ICPMN. I consider myself a dedicated and reasonably intelligent person but it is definitely outside of my circle of competence.

3. **Power Consolidation:**  Followee neurons are amassing too much voting power due to laziness of voters and no economic incentive to re-follow once a follow relationship is in place. 

4. **Lack of Compensation** If people are not paid, it is unreasonable to expect them to spend too much time dedicated to governance. 

Let me know if there are other issues that you see. We should have a running list of all the issues that we currently have. 

Now, here are the problems that I see in your proposed solution. 

1. **Replica Code** It has taken a foundation with the best cryptographers in the world to produce the IC protocol. Would it not take another entire foundation to check the code is safe and secure? I find it hard to believe that a committee of smart folks can really do this properly. Take the bitcoin integration. It's taken about a year. Can a committee reasonably do what needs to be done to confirm all the code is kosher? 

2. **Lack of Compensation** Paying folks with inflation (whether existing or new) is a tax on ICP holders to create a NNS governmental structure. While I do actually support this idea, it is important to recognize the risks this comes with. It is intrinsically against the libertarian ethos of crypto to be taxing people on their money, not least to pay "government" officials. If we go down this route, we need to exercise extreme caution and transparency. This should not be viewed as a way for folks to get rich and if corruption sets in to the NNS government we are done for. 

3. **Roadmap Committee Neuron** I presume this neuron won't be a neuron to just tell Dfinity what to work on? Dfinity is its own entity and can work on whatever it wants to. Right?

4. **Rule by Committee** There are some things which are cut and dry. Like replica code and making sure things are safe and secure. But there are others which are not. The token standard. The SNS. The CF. These are subjective and philosophical. Lets call it governance. Why is a committee better than our current structure of named neurons for governance topics?

Just some thoughts. Thank you for kicking off the conversation as we do need to urgently address the problems outlined above.

-------------------------

I think this is an interesting idea @lastmjs.  I definitely agree that there will need to be changes in order to continue the IC evolution toward decentralization.  I also agree there will need to be an incentive structure established that attracts professionals and experts to fill the roles that will be required.

I hesitate at the idea of a community established roadmap for the NNS or for DFINITY.  All roadmap discussions have focused on the DFINITY roadmap in the past, but perhaps it's time to let that go.  DFINITY owns their own roadmap and should be in full control over it.  To me, they are clearly acting in what they think is the best interest of the IC and should be free to pursue those efforts as they see fit.  They care about what the community thinks and they put a lot of effort into seeking community feedback, but that doesn't mean the community should feel entitled to dictate their roadmap.

So how do we decentralize?  I don't think there is anything preventing other organizations from stepping up to fill similar, yet different roles to DFINITY.  What if your committee idea were integrated into a new sister foundation that could be formed to focus on governance and protocol topics that are important to the community?  A major focus and strength of this foundation would be to help evolve the decentralization of the IC.  It wouldn't need to compete with DFINITY, but rather collaborate and partner with DFINITY.  It would do some of the heavy lifting that the community currently expects from DFINITY.

Perhaps we don't need to look to DFINITY for every technical solution or roadmap priority.  Perhaps it's not the responsibility of DFINITY to create decentralization of the IC.  The community can step up and develop this capability and I suspect DFINITY would support it.

I can envision a community created foundation that might have a purpose and mission that includes some of the following elements:
1. Represent the IC community, which includes developers, large and small investors, community enthusiasts, and end users
2. Conduct research and implement initiatives that advance decentralization of the IC
3. Sponsor initiatives that encourage active participation in IC governance
4. Create significant code bounties that can incentivize developers to implement NNS code changes that are important to the IC community
5. Offer grants to project teams that are focused on NNS governance decentralization
6. Sponsor independent NNS code review teams that can quickly offer an opinion on the safety and security of NNS proposals
7. Sponsor teams of consultants that can offer expert advice on NNS governance related topics (e.g. legal, CPA, government regulations, economic, tokenomic, etc)
8. Sponsor initiatives that incentivize organizations to become registered known neurons in the NNS dApp
9. Develop a working relationship with DFINITY and provide input on roadmap initiatives that are important to the IC community
10. Educate the IC community regarding NNS governance participation and proposal topics
11. Facilitate and advocate for proposal deliberation through various platforms
12. Conduct research and publish information about ICP tokenomics and the effectiveness of governance incentives

The list could go on an on about what value added initiatives could be pursued by this type of foundation and we wouldn't always need to turn to DFINITY for every answer to community concerns.

-------------------------

Gekctek | 2022-08-13 21:29:49 UTC | #16

I like where you are going with this but maybe instead of hard gating based on criteria we can create positive and negative incentives to encourage what we want to see in the NNS voting.
I dont have a good solution because these things are hard but if we come up with a set of things we want to encourage and things that are bad for the community we can work around them.
For good behaviors, maybe increase the voting power or increase rewards for the followee/DAO.
Maybe we want to encourage small groups vs large groups so have diminishing returns on number of followers at a certain point to discourage grouping so large. But that has its own set of issues like what size and sibyl resistance.
Not sure how this would work but if we wanted to encourage expertise in a topic to be encourage while voting, the NNS or some other mechanism could be used to endorse a folowee/DAO as an expert in the field, boosting their voting power/rewards/some other incentive. This way we can start to build trust in certain groups/people, but at the same time allowing liquid democracy to be used.

I think it would be helpful for people to come up with some specific behaviors that we do and don't like in the NNS and use that to design a incentive model to encourage the best behaviour/outcomes

Perhaps DFINITY employees will be on the committee. I would feel uncomfortable if there were no people on the committee who were actually involved in writing the code. But independent experts would also be useful to double-check work or focus on specific aspects of the code. For example, DFINITY has engaged outside auditors.

Defining a roadmap by committee is an anti-pattern imo. This is not only due to lack of expertise but also lack of visibility (or understanding) as to the opportunity cost of a roadmap decision. The idea of a Roadmap Committee Neuron sounds like it could help us avoid this known aformentioned anti-pattern. Its a hard truth that not everone's opinions are equally qualified on all matters.

Correct, this committee neuron would set the roadmap that governs the replica code and the system canisters. If it's not consistent with the roadmap, the other c-neurons should reject the code. The meaning of consistency with the roadmap will have to be discussed, as there may be many small features or improvements that aren't explicitly in the roadmap but mag beneficial.

A foundation like this sounds very interesting, though I'm not sure the existence of this foundation alone would address fundamental issues with the governance structure. I would love to see a foundation like this exist, but it and the rest of the community still need to address the current flaws of the system. Committee neurons are one implementation of that.

Forreal | 2022-08-13 21:59:12 UTC | #24

The rewards should come from the followers. Even a modest percentage of the incentives (e.g., 0.03%) would be enormous in compensating the committees performing the obligations and creating a treasury to conduct any independent investigation or analysis on proposals. So far, I like the initial concept.

-------------------------

Choiseongin | 2022-08-13 22:19:34 UTC | #25

I agree.

Most people don't understand what they're voting for.

Let's admit that people are chasing money to join the community and be ignorant.

We need to find a way to control members like parrots.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-13 22:26:35 UTC | #26

Wouldn't that consensus come from voting on proposals?  We need more public neurons by organizations that can prove themselves capable of filling the technical role and convincing the governing body that they are worth following?  If those neurons existed today, then it could be as simple as removing a specific proposal topic from the All Topics Except Governance catch all category and then giving people a tokenomic reason to intentionally select a Followee for that topic.  This is what happened to partially decentralize the Governance topic and it was effective.  There just hasn't been a reason for more organizations to form public neurons.  I really think the solution to decentralization is going to be related to providing incentives for people and organizations to get much more involved.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-13 23:01:48 UTC | #27

Upon reflection, I am not opposed to the idea of a small amount of existing inflation redirected into a NNS treasury. After all, with DAOs created on the SNS, they will all have a community controlled treasury. So why shouldn't the NNS have a treasury?

That said, I don't love the idea of an elaborate governmental structure that is employed by the NNS itself. Rule by committee at the NNS-level itself feels a bit scary and prone to corruption. 

Rather, I think it would make sense for private organizations to apply for funding from the NNS treasury. They would have to demonstrate they have in place the right people for the job and the right structures to ensure transparency and accountability. Such grants I think should go to non-profit foundations who can use the funds to pay its committee members to further the goals of the non-profit. 

This could open up a whole new set of possibilities. DFINITY would be just one non-profit contributing to ICP development. Imagine if CycleDao incorporated as a non-profit and got funding from the NNS treasury. Maybe they would have not bailed on the project...If organizations fail to perform their duties, or become corrupt, they can be cut off from funding. 

@lastmjs @bob11 thoughts? It is worth noting that the amount of existing inflation this would require would go down over time as the price of ICP goes up and the ecosystem develops....

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-13 23:09:13 UTC | #28

I'm just not sure the simple liquid democracy we have will ever be enough to satisfy the demands placed on the community.

As an example, in my mind the most important material aspect of governance currently is ensuring that the replica code and system canisters are upgraded securely. To feel comfortable with security updates, I want to see multiple (probably 2-3) independent entities to review all changes and sign off on them. How can we do that with the neuron structure we have right now? I wonder if it is necessary to create neurons with different capabilities than they currently have.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-13 23:11:37 UTC | #29

I like these ideas, but I think they can be implemented in tandem with committee neurons or some other upgrade to the governance mechanism.

The NNS having its own treasury makes a lot of sense in my mind, then organizations like DFINITY can apply for funding, or the NNS DAO can give out its own grants to the community (in addition to DFINITY).

[/quote]

Yes...in a way.  I think we need organizations (or people) that can specialize in certain proposal topics.  There can/should be many of them.  They need to be incentivized to do it, but their presence would give people an option for who to follow.  In fact, public neurons who don't claim to specialize in that topic can also choose to follow them.  This structure exists today.  All we need are incentives for neurons to specialize.

If I know your neuron ID and 14 other neuron IDs for people I know and trust on a specialized proposal topic...and you all commit to fulfilling the obligation of always voting on that proposal type (due to attractive incentives), then you, me, or anyone else could form a named neuron that specializes in that proposal type and promote it as an option to the community.  I don't even need to be an expert on that topic as the neuron manager.  I just need to know who is who and manage my neuron followees with people I know and trust on that proposal topic and I need to publicize it effectively.  This could happen with dozens of specialists and dozens of public neurons.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-13 23:40:07 UTC | #31

It’s probably worth separating out the proposals for committees and a NNS treasury. 

Personally I think the primary function of the committee should be to oversee the spending of the NNS treasury. The amounts of money will get large and at a minimum we’ll need people dedicated to making sure it is not wasted.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-13 23:56:57 UTC | #32

Why is a committee that’s paid by the NNS treasury to ensure the replica code is safe and secure better than a private organization that gets funding from the NNS treasury to make sure the replica code is safe and secure? 

Just want to make sure I understand the nuance of what you’re proposing

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-14 00:00:26 UTC | #33

What I'm proposing requires changes to neurons, so that committee neurons can adopt proposals when their members vote, without regard to the rest of the NNS.

I'm proposing that replica code cannot be updated without the committee's approval (or perhaps with a very large majority vote of the NNS as a check on the committee). I think it might be hard to ensure this using the current neuron system with outside funding.

The core component here I think is the committee neurons' ability to unilaterally adopt or reject proposals.

Eva stopped by the ICP Maximalist Network telegram group yesterday and posted about a couple of new initiatives she and the growth team are going to start brainstorming.  One of them was about Neuron Following in which she indicated she wants to look at ways to “motivate people to follow other neurons (experts) and conversely reward experts for following them.”  There are similarities with what you have in mind regarding motivating expert participation in governance.  You should stop by and search for her name (@ evafromgeneva on TG) and then read the commentary afterward.  It sounds pretty interesting.

A good c-neuron to start with (as a test of this feature) would be [System Canister Management](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance?topic=TOPIC_NETWORK_CANISTER_MANAGEMENT), which is used to update the NNS canister.

@diegop answered many of my questions with respect to how DFINITY currently controls their neuron [in this comment](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-process-does-the-dfinity-foundation-use-to-vote-on-nns-proposals/11385/12?u=justmythoughts).

He also detailed a bit regarding the pager-type notifications each of the 9-voting members have for voting on urgent replica updates:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801/71?u=justmythoughts

Putting together c-neurons that are gatekeepers to the actual protocol requires a much higher level of commitment than the current named neurons. 

I mean no offense by this to any of the of the current named neurons, but being paged several times from 1:30am to 4am to get up to speed on an issue and make a coherent vote on it is not easy. It requires technical expertise on top of dedication. If a replica update gets pushed out and needs to be rolled back or a emergency patch fix, the c-neuron members need to be reachable and ready to go, even to the point of staggering vacation/time-off if membership is small enough.

As much as I've pushed back on this publicly, I honestly don't trust the NNS community with voting at the code-change level right now. We'd end up with members who are whales and/or non-technical members of the community instead of those with specific expertise or at least high-level knowledge of the specific changes being made.

Realistically, I don't think that DFINITY would approve of this either in the current state - even if you rally enough support in a governance proposal to approve of these changes, DFINITY would not implement them, and then any subsequent development efforts would be wasted since the community would not be able to gather enough voting power to pass a replica code change via the System Canister Mangement topic (where everyone currently follows DFINITY).

<br/>
<br/>

It's for that reason that I recommend an the following experiment as a "half-measure":

That DFINITY temporarily allow just a single, technically well-versed member from the community to become a voting member of the DFINITY neuron, to see if this community member can realistically assume non-governance topic voting responsibilities and meaningfully contribute to the DFINITY neuron.

DFINITY would allow the voting member in for 1-3 months to vote on a pre-defined subset of topics, and can obviously kick them out at any time DFINITY wishes to do so. If the voting member's contributions impress DFINITY, then DFINITY may slowly gain more trust in the other members of the community to assume various responsibilities.

By DFINITY doing this, it would go a long way towards obliging and quieting the community's concerns about not having a voice in the protocol, which has been a recurring and persistent discussion topic over the past few months.

I would nominate you, @lastmjs to assume this responsibility as a voting member of the DFINITY neuron.

I agree that we should scope this down to an MVP. I'm not sure starting with something as security-sensitive as the replica code is a good idea though.

Perhaps we should start with a roadmap c-neuron?

If we wanted to move forward with c-neurons, we could come up with a careful plan to progressively decentralize them. Perhaps the security-sensitive c-neurons would be required to have a certain amount of DFINITY-appointed experts in them until a specified time in the future.

Starting with the roadmap seems like a better idea right now though. Not as much is at stake.

Just that there will be some brainstorming of how to incentivize experts to participate in governance.  Seems reasonable to me.  We will never decentralize if we rely only on community members who volunteer their time.

[/quote]

I'd prefer for this experiment to have some actual skin in the game. As I mentioned above, being a (1/10) or (1/11) member of the DFINITY neuron would be a good half measure - DFINITY would still have a very comfortable quorum, and could kick you out at any time. You could then take your learnings from how they manage the "expert members" and then spin off this c-neuron plan. Or maybe it would convince you that a different plan is better before investing days of engineering time?

I honestly don't understand the purpose of having a roadmap neuron. I feel similarly about the governance topic. What's the point of taking the time of thousands of people to gauge their interest on a topic if there's no forcing function that produces results from that vote.

I may be pessimistic or not completely understanding your idea of the roadmap neuron, but I currently see governance proposals as the equivalent of glorified surveys.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-08-14 01:25:06 UTC | #43

The issue I see is then how do you or I define an "expert"? What does that mean, and what qualities should they have?

Did Eva or the Growth team elaborate on any of these ideas?

I'm more on board with the representative democracy idea here where experts can be easily voted in and voted out by the greater NNS community, but just the panel of experts or "c-neuron members" decides the daily fate of proposals in certain topic categories.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-14 01:24:57 UTC | #44

So I believe we now have a forcing function with c-neurons. The roadmap c-neuron would set the vision and represent the will of the community. The replica code c-neuron would be responsible for only allowing changes into the replica that are aligned with the roadmap passed by the roadmap c-neuron. If the community sees that the replica c-neuron is allowing in changes that shouldn't be there, they can rearrange the membership. Or perhaps the roadmap c-neuron can have other checks on the replica code, by being able to reject code changes or vote on them in some way. If we split up these groups and allow them to check each other, we might have this forcing function that you speak of.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-08-14 01:28:09 UTC | #45

So then what you're describing requires both the roadmap c-neuron and a replica code (Subnet Management) c-neuron. 

Why not just start with Subnet Management and see how that works out?


<br/>

But to back up just a bit, how are you going to convince DFINITY approve of and vote for this change? Otherwise this will just end up being a waste of time.

Because it's way more dangerous. The roadmap c-neuron would allow us to clean up our messy governance proposals right away.

@lastmjs 
I just want to echo this comment by @justmythoughts because I think it is currently under appreciated.  If the community wants something pushed through the NNS, then we need to spend time learning how to do it.  It won’t happen overnight.  It requires developing expertise for this outside DFINITY and partnering with DFINITY.  It also requires incentives and a few basic changes in default neuron configurations, but DFINITY has already provided an example to the community for how this can work when they did it for the Governance proposal topic.  I think we are better off thinking of strategies for how to best work with the system we have instead of trying to make fundamental changes or trying to control DFINITY.

I love your optimism :wink: 

In addition to community approval, you'd need to then get a group of non-DFINITY developers to design and implement this, and then the real hurdle would be getting a majority of the 9 voting DFINITY neuron members to vote to approve the replica code changes. God speed, and good luck :rocket:

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-14 01:34:07 UTC | #51

There are a few things to consider here.

I'm not sure we need to take away governance proposals from the community, but perhaps we should create a higher bar for these proposals to pass. I'm thinking that the community should always be able to check the c-neurons somehow, perhaps with a supermajority vote of some kind.

As for electing the c-neuron members, yes some new topic or maybe just through following. For example, if you follow someone for a certain c-neuron, that counts as a real-time vote for that person. Those with enough votes become members of the c-neuron. Follower relationships can be changed in real-time.

justmythoughts | 2022-08-14 01:39:15 UTC | #53

DFINITY has yet to themselves implement a community-passed proposal that required any significant code change (other than the re-configuration of a parameter).

The only community passed proposals that were implemented thus far were:
* The changing of governance voting rewards weights
* The backup/removal change to seed phrases for Internet Identity (for which the code change was implemented by the community)

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-14 01:41:23 UTC | #54

Seems like they actually did a lot of work on the II change after we did a lot of work on it (I'm not sure much of my code even made it to production), I think our pull request was more of a motivator for them to actually do the work. They collaborated with us a lot though.

So, perhaps it will be the same way. If DFINITY doesn't want to take it head on we (maybe me, hopefully not though) can implement it ourselves and attempt to get it incorporated. That may be enough to push it forward. It would be interesting whatever happened though.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-14 01:44:06 UTC | #55

@lastmjs also don’t forget you can’t take away the requirement that neurons vote to get voting rewards.  This is fundamental to ICP tokenomics.  We cannot give away voting rewards for doing nothing or ICP is at high risk of becoming a security.  Hence, you can’t just let c-neurons make unilateral decision on proposals, especially if those proposal topics are the most common governance decisions that have to be decided by the NNS.  Your idea really needs to work the way liquid democracy works today.  Perhaps a c-neuron is regarded as a defacto authority on a given “new” proposal topic, but it’s act of approving or rejecting needs to cast liquid democracy.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-14 01:46:36 UTC | #56

If people follow member neurons then they can get the rewards whenever the c-neurons vote. This is assuming m-neurons are "elected" by people following them for specific c-neurons.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-14 02:04:19 UTC | #57

I’m also a bit confused on the purpose of the c-neurons for Roadmap. What does it mean to implement the will of the community? Why does liquid democracy not work to represent the community provided we fix the structural issues around power concentration and limited named neurons?

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-08-14 02:17:13 UTC | #58

@lastmjs I love seeing your thoughts here because they parallel a lot of my own. Some types of decisions are just never going to be well managed by a large group of strangers casting anonymous independent votes.

Imagine a company like Samsung being a DAO, how could a mob of laymen ever drive a more effective corporate strategy than a team of experienced executives?

Organizations lead by a highly competent board of directors is currently the most effective way we've found to run complex corporations and governments, the only problem is the greed and corruption which festers anywhere there's a concentration of power which lacks accountability (or worse, is only held accountable to maximizing greed at the expense of human good).

I've been working on a new DAO structure (more for web3 in general and not specifically for the NNS) and gaining feedback on it from a few others in the community. Hopefully I'll find the time to finish writing and publish the whitepaper within the next few months.

A key part of this new DAO structure is something I'm calling an "Accountability Market" to make sure board members (committee members in your terms) are held accountable to the outcome of their decisions by the community. It should also prevent the possibility of committee members becoming entrenched, since their removal would be automated by the protocol.

Within the context of the NNS and your Committee Neuron proposal, it would look something like this:
1. The votes of each committee members are logged, and the committee neuron determines the outcome of a proposal.
2. A set time period later (perhaps 3-6 months) the protocol triggers an accountability proposal that's voted on by the NNS. Essentially, this proposal asks the community if the decision the committee neuron passed had a positive or negative outcome.
3. These accountability proposals are used to score the voting record of each committee member. If a committee member's score drops past a set threshold (they often vote against positive outcomes and/or for negative outcomes as determined by the community), then they are automatically fired, and removed from the committee by the protocol.

The idea here is that a public voters would often be much more effective evaluating an outcome rather than determining a complex solution upfront. While finding solutions often requires a lot of skill and expertise, outcomes after the fact are often fairly obvious to almost anyone.

I'd love to setup a chat with you, or maybe even do a Twitter Space or something, so that we could engage in some live discussion on these ideas!

The community follows/elects representatives that they trust to come up with the best roadmap for the IC.

Because they were elected by the community on their behalf to choose the roadmap, the roadmap becomes the will of the community.

There are a few dangerous aspects of this concept (if I'm understanding it correctly):
1. If people aren't experts themselves, they'll do a poor job picking experts and be easily swayed by people who "act" like experts.
2. If big neurons can boost rewards by increasing followers, then that'll inherently lead to the consolidation of power, not the decentralization of it.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-08-14 02:32:16 UTC | #63

I do think committee neurons is worth exploring, but perhaps the complexity could be too much too soon for the NNS.

There are other options though, I'm going to copy below a comment I recently posted on the Daowabunga channel of the Psychedelic Discord server (this is another proposal I need to write up soon):

---

Nima & I chatted about this on the live DSCR thread , but I just wanted to bring it up again. I think **Quadratic Voting** would be a great proposal for the NNS, and I would love to see this come from the Psychedelic Neuron. 

Nima said Daowabunga's v2 governance canister's will likely support Quadratic Voting, which is awesome! 

Even if the NNS was much more decentralized, there will always be a threat of very rich and powerful entities (think BlackRock) buying influence as long as 1-on-1 voting is in place.

It's tricky, but governance power should be liquid yet not so liquid such that the outcome of decisions can be outright purchased (sadly in the USA it's both illiquid and up for sale). Sure, the ICP supply can be mostly locked into Neurons, but ultimately this would only slow down the quiet and subtle accumulation of a large bad actor.

Quadratic Voting would reduce DFINITY's influence without destroying their revenue stream. I assume they ultimately plan to cover the cost of operations using the maturity of their neurons. Having them airdrop their ICP and/or neurons would introduce a wide range of issues, and I see no problem with the inventors of the protocol having a good long term strategy for funding R&D operations. If we can find a way for them to keep their maturity without being too powerful or hurting the ecosystem, then that would be ideal.

In fact, I actually think it may be smart to have the neuron maturity rewards slightly decrease to perhaps 10%-25% of the current rate for small neurons if we enable Quadratic Voting. This means that as your neuron stake increases, your additional voting power decreases exponentially while your maturity reward rate slightly improves.

This would have a few positive implications:

--------------------------------
- If you vote manually, you'll earn a slightly smaller amount of maturity for that particular vote, but your vote will be given significantly more influence in determining the outcome. This means you must choose between a small loss of profit vs a principle which may matter a great deal to you, and a wave of passionate manual votes by small neurons could have a chance against of handful of large neurons followed by all the passive voters.

- The power of Quadratic Voting could easily be circumvented by a large and powerful bad actor if they simply created thousands of small neurons which followed the votes of their primary neuron. By forcing them to choose between maximizing profit vs maximizing influence, we should gain a bit more resilience for the protocol. While nothing can be made impossible, we should make purchasing significant control of the NNS as infeasible as possible (ideally, exponentially less feasible the harder you try).
------------------------------------------

I'd be happy to publish a more detailed write-up of this concept if you think it's something Psychedelic might want to support. Just let me know!

 A few other thoughts: 
- It could be smart to also introduce a small fee for creating new neurons (or splitting one). This would also hurt bad actor efforts to get around quadratic voting by creating lots of small neurons rather than a single large one.

- There should be a "Defer" or "More Info Needed" voting option on the NNS. It wouldn't immediately kill the proposal like a "No" vote, but instead holds it open longer and allows edits until the "Defer" voters can feel good picking either "Yes" or "No". Incentivizing voting activity is a good idea, but on it's own it introduces a risk of careless voting just to harvest rewards. There should be something to help prevent this, since default "No" or "Yes" from the bulk of careless voters would both lead to bad outcomes. In other words, people shouldn't be penalized for not understanding a poorly written proposal, or forced into voting out of ignorance.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-08-14 02:46:20 UTC | #64

Can we skip a few steps and create a House of Representatives style committee and have liquid democracy elect those qualified people to vote? Remove voting rights from the average person while simultaneously making it easier for people to stake.

[/quote]

Unfortunately, I don’t think Quadratic voting is possible within the way the NNS is currently drawn up.

This would just result in large neurons splitting into many small neurons in order to regain voting power. Charging a fee to get around this would make it difficult for those who want to split and dissolve part of their neuron. Currently the fee that’s already charged for splitting a neuron is mostly just to cover the computational cost. If it’s an additional flat fee being charged, this would just act as a regressive tax.

If you have other ideas on how to combat this in the context of the NNS I’m all ears.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-14 02:51:56 UTC | #66

Quadratic voting ideas are indeed interesting, and they've been explored to some extent in the forums already. If you'd like to discuss it in more detail perhaps let's create a new thread dedicated to that, link it here, and keep this one focused on committee neurons.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-14 03:51:53 UTC | #67

These are all very valuable ideas, I think we have to move towards something like quadratic voting to lessen Dfinity's hold on the NNS. A large fee to split neurons would be sufficient disincentive against whales gaming the system. But of course, @justmythoughts objection is valid, it would be regressive to charge a large amount for people wishing to split to dissolve a portion of a neuron.
I think there is a way around it, though it adds complexity to the NNS which is already pretty complicated. This is the solution: if you split a neuron, the split part begins dissolving automatically for no charge. If you want to split a neuron *without* dissolving, you then get charged a fee, either as one payment upfront or constant rent until you dissolve.
I agree this deserves a separate thread, although there are some overlaps with the committee neuron idea.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-14 04:37:55 UTC | #68

I think you may be reading more than what was said.  We need experts to get involved in governance and they need to be incentivized.  We shouldn’t assume these experts will get rewarded proportional to the voting power that follows them.  The mechanism of incentives was not part of the discussion.

I think this proposal for committee neurons is interesting and relatively simple, which is great.

I'm not sure I totally buy the problem that it's trying to solve though.

[quote="lastmjs, post:1, topic:14848, full:true"]
NNS governance has been plagued with a number of issues in its first year of existence. It’s generally unorganized and ineffective in various ways. I think this stems from a few reasons, including that for most material aspects (like updates to the actual protocol itself), it is controlled by one party (DFINITY) that cannot actually be controlled directly by the NNS.
[/quote]

It's true that nobody outside of DFINITY is seriously checking the replica code changes, but has that been a problem yet? There haven't been any major security vulnerabilities or hacks. (Actually, DFINITY has hired a few third-party auditors to review the code.)

AFAICT, the biggest problem with governance seems to a disagreement over the roadmap and who implements it. The community votes for stuff they expect DFINITY to implement, and they also don't want DFINITY to implement some other stuff.

I'm not sure a committee solves either of those problems. Especially with respect to the former, what we need is more people willing to read and write IC [code](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/8d95321c6470e7b087b338f9d39dc7942333ec29). That way, the community can implement its own changes and put them up for a vote in a proposal. I don't know how we can encourage (or even incentivize) this, however.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-08-14 05:24:11 UTC | #71

I honestly still have concerns with even the general concept of designing any form of extra incentive for Neurons run by "experts".

Power and influence are enough incentive on their own, and without help power/influence tends to naturally snowball and consolidate.

There are plenty of ways experts can monetize their influence external from the NNS (podcasts, affiliate links, consulting services, bribes, etc), the protocol should not need to provide any of it's own.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2022-08-14 07:28:39 UTC | #72

Maybe at a basic level we need a process to test the changes and not necessarily make the changes. Adding any code requires specific set of skills and time. I would just like to know what the process of making the changes and deploying it to the IC even looks like.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-14 07:47:40 UTC | #73

One reason for providing incentives is precisely so experts are less tempted to accept bribes. Not saying it won't happen anyway, greed can be infinite, but not paying ensures one of two outcomes: 1) Experts will give up saying it's not worth the effort; and 2) They will seek external incentives not aligned with the role they were voted in to play.

Thank goodness that Definity have had control of this project that come about with a clear vision from Dominic. The experience I have experience from the neurons owners has not been a great experience in my opinion as I feel we could have had a class action on our hands from the only ones that want to speak up for their own selfish purpose that was voted down as I feel most didn’t agree. 

The Definity team in my opinion have done a great job and doing what I expect and that is to expand the network and complete the shortfall of the top Crypto. Also if it wasn’t for the Definity and teams the NNS would be reward less as there, in my opinion, has been very little for neuron owners and their recommendation other than the span, Thanks' Dog Boy for the extra rewards.

To be honest even if the neuron owners had great ideas and recommended changes, as I believe it, there was no one to make those changes anyway. 

>effectiveness of smaller groups of expert leaders, while providing the means to prevent those leaders from abusing their positions of influence and power. 

Lol, sorry, lol

>Very excellent feedback, I especially lean towards your line of thinking on the rewards.

Surprise, surprise, I will not be signing up for any of this.

>Power Consolidation: Followee neurons are amassing too much voting power due to laziness of voters and no economic incentive to re-follow once a follow relationship is in place.

Those who claim they do work are really following as there is nothing to vote on except Definity and the teams, sorry I forgot the spam. Tell me about the work you did on voting @dfisher that following didn’t?

Thanks for sharing this proposal @lastmjs! While I think I understand your intent, I think your proposal may benefit from an explicit "problem statement", explaining precisely what you aim to improve.  

> Roadmap Committee Neuron
The roadmap c-neuron votes on the direction of the protocol. It would set the vision for all other c-neurons to follow. This c-neuron would be a check on all other c-neurons, as if the other c-neurons do not follow the roadmap c-neuron, then the NNS could work to rearrange the memberships of those c-neurons. And as stated above, this c-neuron could be as large or small and as diverse as they NNS community desires.

Could you clarify what the main difference is between how the system currently works for the governance topic vs your proposal? It seems somewhat similar to me actually: Today NNS voters can choose to delegate their vote by following, and in your proposal they can "delegate" the vote by voting certain members into the roadmap committee. 

> Replica Committee Neuron
Considering that the replica code is the most vital and security-sensitive part of the entire IC ecosystem, the greatest care should be taken to ensure that updates to its code are safe and secure. The replica c-neuron members would be tasked with reviewing all code changes, and also not allowing anything into the replica that was not in line with the roadmap set by the roadmap c-neuron.
Especially at this time, almost little else matters in on-chain governance than the replica’s code. It’s unilaterally controlled by DFINITY at this point in time. Having a c-neuron control the code would even provide a check on DFINITY, as though they could work on whatever they wanted, the replica c-neuron should not allow changes through that are not in line with the proposals passed by the roadmap c-neuron.

I think this is a very good point. While I think that DFINITY does a good job reviewing the technical side of things, I do also think it would be healthy to have some additional "checks", especially as you mentioned, checking that all significant changes are in line with what the community wants, and if not, vote to reject saying "we think feature X should be a separate motion proposal first". I think this could be achieved quite easily already: Some neurons today (eg ICPMN and ICDevs) indicate that they vote manually on all proposals in topic governance. We could have neurons similarly indicate they will vote on topic "elect replica version" manually, and invite followers on that topic. This would only require replica version proposals to be their own topic (which I think would be a reasonable thing to do anyway, and should be almost no work). I'm involved in the ICPMN neuron and I really hope that in the future this neuron (and others!) would independently vote on multiple topics, instead of just governance.

I suppose the main difference would be commitee members would be compensated way more than they currently are.

Compensating committee members doesn't require changing the system of how we reach consensus.  That can happen by changing tokenomics or by funding experts from a treasury dedicated for that purpose.  

@Manu 
I think @lastmjs already described the main difference...

[quote="lastmjs, post:33, topic:14848"]
The core component here I think is the committee neurons’ ability to unilaterally adopt or reject proposals.
[/quote]

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/committee-neurons/14848/33

Also, by the way, I think the desired outcome of decentralization can be achieved without changes to consensus of our current system.  We need to incentivize people and organizations to become public neurons and give people reasons to follow them.

Committee = Neuron
Committee Member  = Followee

A c-neuron (e.g. Replica Committee Neuron) just needs to be a named neuron in the NNS dApp that has experts configured as Followees for the specific proposal types that update the replica.  These experts need to be incentivized to fulfill this job reliably.  There can be many experts and many of these specialized neurons if people are motivated to provide this service to the IC community.  

Once they exist, the proposal type that updates the replica can be removed from the All Topics Except Governance and then additional proposal weight needs to be given to that proposal type.  A fraction of the voting body will naturally migrate to following this new specialized public neuron in order to maximize their own voting rewards.  DFINITY will undoubtedly not follow one of these public neurons because they would follow their own technical experts, so no matter what they would retain their 22% of total voting power.

Better incentives will result in more experts and more public neurons.  More public neurons results in a higher degree of decentralization.  Decentralization will require incentives in my opinion.  I just don't think volunteerism or power and influence are strong enough incentives for people to fill these expert roles.  This is evidenced by how few public neurons exist for the Governance topic.

Hello!

I would suggest adding another coefficient to Voting Power. More precisely, a couple. Developer Rank/The rank of the community.
The Rank of the Developer can grow depending on the activity on the github, and the Rank of the Community on the number of manual votes.
In each proposal, the initiator of the proposal himself sets the weight of the voice for developers and the community. 
For example, the introduction of a new token standard worries developers more than community. And vice versa. The percentage for staking is more concerned with the community than the developer.
This would help to avoid such misunderstandings in the voting.

rbolog | 2022-08-14 21:03:27 UTC | #79

Hello,

To begin with, I would like to say that it is extraordinary what dFinity has put in place. We read a proposal from an active but not founding member that questions the governance of ICP. It's a bit like AWS customers giving instructions to Jeff Bezos.  

Honestly, I think it's awesome.

**Regarding the proposal**:
It mentions that there are a number of problems, now even if we can agree on that, I think we should start by listing them, and then show how this proposal could solve them or improve the situation. 
I'm not convinced that moving to a representative model will solve the "problems" but I think it will create more:
- Transparency - what are the interests of the experts or members
- Election of these in a global digital organization. With a forum or github ? ...
- Control organs, all democratic systems have checks and balances: justice, press, popular protest, etc...

I am convinced that, the proposal is with a very good intention, but I don't believe that it will solve anything.

I’m not sure that I’m all caught up on the feedback, but here are some of my initial thoughts:

1. I am very COLD in the idea of compensating anyone for their participation out of a shared pool because it creates attack vectors for spam. I’ve proposed shifting to voter based pools here and I still think it is a good idea because it allows us to put weights back in and encourage decentralization while funding a dev or NNS treasury with the forfeited inflation(or burn it) https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-covert-from-system-based-reward-to-voter-based-reward-to-implement-an-accept-quorum-mechanism-and-to-return-the-reject-cost-to-1-icp/12813 . I don’t want career politicians in the NNS voting to perpetuate the system.  If you want to incentivize them, give them locked neurons and the market will take care of the in incentives.(ICDevs model)…if we want to continue to exist then we need to make ICP fly) 

2. I don’t see why we don’t just use the current system. How would this be different than adding new topics that you could delegate your votes to?  Topic is an int32 which gives us the ability to have 2B of them.  We could add an extensible proposal variant and have an NNS function that creates/retires them as necessary. We already have weights so we can incentivize voters to select a delegate and when “change your vote” is implemented we have a built in citizen veto.

3. I think this is a UI problem. Make new topics/creating named neurons/selecting and advertising delegates easy and I think the system will self assemble.

More thoughts later. Great topic and direction Jordan….let’s find an mvp with the parts already laying around.

Agreed with all your points. 

I'm afraid this proposal might add unneeded complexity and the risk of more centralization on top of an already shaky system.

kvic | 2022-08-14 20:42:44 UTC | #84

It seems to me this proposal is designed to take away the freedoms that past big tech projects where built on, investors money, that could invest on these projects but had no say, that was left up to the few that have great potential but this proposal wants to give a bunch of committees the ability to stifle inspiration who are motivated to have control just so they can control who gets rewards.

I have had enough of the few neuron owners on the forum that are trying to massage the future of the NNS around themselves and would like to hear from those who continue to vote down their proposals.

We need to get the SNS and CF right so that the IC benefits first and then we are all rewarded by its success.

I propose we are allowed to invest our neuron on projects that I personally feel I want to invest on because I see potential and let those inspirational project builders build.

I am not inspired by this proposal

What's the status on implementing this? Are you reliant on the DF to code it up? If we can incentivize voting on governance topics without incentivizing spam that is one necessary but not sufficient ingredient towards promoting decentralization.

I assume that this is waiting on the SNS to ship like a number of other governance things.  Someone else *could* get started on this, but they’d need to be a hell of a rust dev and really understand the NNS inside and out.

Why pure liquid democracy better than representative democracy:

1. Representative democracy is proven fail us in reality governance world. 

2. Representative's objectiveness is easy to be steered and redirected to align with the lobbyist agenda.
3. The decision power will only tap several mind of so-called 'popular' experts / representatives who might have better skill in politic, lobbying & mass communication instead of their core competencies.

Pure liquid democracy looks chaotic, unorganized and inefficient, but it represents the true spirit of decentralization & people's voice / power.

With current pure liquid democracy on ICP, actually we can achieve same/better result without changing to representative democracy.

Idea to improve current liquid democracy:

To encourage many experts to create their neurons and start to contribute to ICP governance, the followers should share some % of their neuron maturity with their expert neuron. 
If they are too lazy to vote by themself and it is fair if they share some of their maturity yield with the neuron owner's they follow.

This is also to encourage people to participate and vote actively on their own if they do not want to share their % maturity.

hugoelec | 2022-08-15 03:35:00 UTC | #88

i think followee already does that represent Ness of voting, with right voting power distribution. your c neuron doesn't mention about where those voting power profits go.

-------------------------

hugoelec | 2022-08-15 03:57:45 UTC | #89

we all know that democracy is slow and painful process, while dictatorship is fastest way to govern. Steve Jobs biography says it, but Steve Jobs is hard to come by. picking followee is better solution on this topic, since we can change it anytime we want.

Hi all,

thanks for the lively discussion and the many interesting ideas (in the original post and all the answers).
As is evident from this discussion, there are a few things that we might want to improve in governance. Also, there are already many different ideas how to achieve some of these improvements (e.g., including internal discussions as mentioned [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/committee-neurons/14848/34)).

As already announced by @bjoernek in a different thread, we think that it would be good to set up a governance working group. It sounds like many of the things discussed here would be perfect for discussing in this group!
We are looking into how and when to set this up, likely this will happen after we wrapped up the SNS MVP work.

One feedback to the main post (some of this has already been mentioned by others): it might be beneficial for the discussion here, as well as for the working group, to make very explicit.. 
* What are the core problems that a proposal tries to solve? Why are these problems?
* Can the design / problem statement be broken down into different components? (E.g., here the concept of roadmap proposals seems to be new. Is this something that would also be relevant independently of committee neurons?) 
* How is this design different (pros and cons) from the current implementation and from alternative options?
* Can the proposal be evaluated against the governance goals defined [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/assessing-governance-voting-enhancements/12801) or does it propose new goals that should be added (that is, does it suggest that we change what we mean by "good governance")?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-15 11:54:49 UTC | #91

I want to respond to those pointing out the problem statements I started with. I apologize, I do feel like I didn't spend much time accurately coming up with the exact problems that exist and why this would solve those. I contemplated leaving the problem statements out and just offering up this design for consideration, as I generally feel this design to have characteristics required to make liquid democracy actually work. Deeper analysis is warranted, I'm just glad we are discussing various solutions to the problems, whatever those are, that exist.

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-08-15 13:23:45 UTC | #92

Wow, this is an amazing thread! Thanks and kudos to @lastmjs for kicking it off!

I must admit am not really on-board with c-neurons (since I am not convinced of their advantage over building similar structures with the more liquid following mechanism) or the roadmap committee (which I think would amplify some problems we have with the governance topic today). On the flip side, I fully agree that replica upgrades are likely the most important type of proposal that need more decentralization – but they're also the hardest one, since it takes significant effort to just stay current with all the changes happening in the weekly releases, let alone reviewing them for security.

What I think may be helpful is picking one particular topic that we want to improve decentralization on (as I said replica would be great, but it's also very hard), and then we iterate on how we'd see a good scenario for that work out, and think about governance improvements from there? That will probably allow us to focus on fundamental discussion first (e.g., should some people be rewarded for putting significant effort into validating proposals; how can their work be evaluated; who decides what they get; where is that paid from) and then we can look into the best technical solutions? A good candidate could also be upgrades of governance canisters, which are a lot more manageable since the respective code base is a lot smaller.

I wonder if a good first step is the ability to decentralize the control of a single neuron. Right now, AFAIK, neurons can only be controlled by one key pair. So the 9-member neuron that DFINITY owns and is used to control updates to the replica code, really only has one key pair that can unilaterally push changes. This is according to my understanding. You've written about this here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-create-a-decentralized-community-neuron/12564

**Regarding point #1:** Representative democracy can succeed and work well unless the structure hosting it is already corrupt itself. Just because something fails sometimes, that doesn't mean all aspects or iterations of it are inherently flawed. By contrast, no one has ever been able to run something more complex than MakerDAO (which essentially only needs to set interest rates) using current Web3 DAO structures. We simply do not have a way to run a large complex organization (a company like Samsung for example) with direct vote public poles or the standard web3 DAO structures.

**Regarding point #2:** Crowd objectiveness is also easily steered by digital ads, the media, and famous people. Mobs can be just as stupid and corrupt as individuals, if not more so.

**Regarding point #3:** Exactly, which is why I think new accountability mechanisms which can automatically remove bad representatives at the protocol level will be crucial! (see my other comment here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/committee-neurons/14848/63?u=aiv) However, at least individuals can have competency, any competencies within a crowd tends to get drowned out by noise. Mobs are not good at making decisions on very complex topics which require experience, knowledge, and skill. A mob will also make decisions blindly on the provided options without any motivation or ability to create new options or compose alternate solutions. This still leaves most of the power with those who decide which options to present for public vote. For example, the whole brexit thing was extremely messy. Also, would you trust a public vote on a highly technical task like the development of an update to the specifications of Ethernet cables?

-------------------------

bjoern | 2022-08-15 14:30:43 UTC | #97

The main DFINITY beacon neuron is actually controlled in the way I outlined in that forum post you linked – there is no single key pair controlling it. For all voting topics, it follows a group of other neurons which are controlled by individual key pairs.

we only need to allow the motion proposal to have the right to fork, and ensure that the whole process of the motion proposal (creation, on-chain discussion, voting, and results) is not controlled by any centralized organization.
