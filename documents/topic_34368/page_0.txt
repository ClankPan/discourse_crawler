In light of CMC and CG hiding ICP from certain categories, I think this is a concerted effort from the establishment to hide ICP from new developers and willfully ignore ICP innovations. They are doing the greater Crypto community a disservice and its almost criminal.
Time for ICP ecosystem to build a truly decentralized price aggregator maybe build a new decentralized price discovery service or expand the current icpcoins or icptokens to include non-ICP tokens as well. The new price aggregator will source data from  other L1s through chain fusion, CExs through APIs, EVMs via chain fusion or RPC,  and all this will be  SNS driven and data sources and L1s will be voted by SNS

Far too long have price aggregators manipulated the market by excluding or including tokens which pay-to-play and other shenanigans
imagine how big this decentralized price service can grow to. It can include securities, metals commodities as well. and the best part , it can be onchain and SNS driven
