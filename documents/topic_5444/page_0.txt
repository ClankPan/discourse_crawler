If anyone can help I have some questions regarding controlling the seed neurons in the command line.

1.If our nerons are not set to dissolve and have more than 6 month dissolve delay are we automatically staking?

2.If a neuron has under 6 months dissolve delay and we choose to increase delay to a figure over 6 months are we staking again? Is that the only way to re stake a dissolving neuron?

3.Where is the staking reward ICP found? Is it added to the neuron? How do we know when new ICP has been added? How do you withdraw reward ICP?

4. How do we interpret the maturity_e8s_equivalent figure?

5.How do we interpret the voting power figure?
