Hey there guys, I don't know if this is the right place for such a question, but I am honestly just scared.

Since today, every time I want to log into the NNs with my internet identity, it won't let me anymore.
Instead, it just states, "Something went wrong during authentication. The authenticating service was notified, and you may close this page."


What does this mean? Should I be scared or worried? Because I definitely am!

Issue has been resolved with a hot fix rollback [proposal](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=130068). I understand there will be a post mortem for more information.

In other words, you should be able to sign-in again.
