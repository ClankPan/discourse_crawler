For assets canister, when `source` key in dfx.json is not a valid path, it shows an error:
```The post-build step failed for canister 'ai7t5-aibaq-aaaaa-aaaaa-c' with an embedded error: No such file or directory (os error 2)```

Also, it doesn't show any errors when `frontend.entrypoint` key in dfx.json is not a valid path.

dfx 0.9.0

Thank you, @Nakamotik! This helped me track down the solution when I was getting the same error just now. Sure would be helpful if the error listed the erroneous path. Quite hard to track down without that.
