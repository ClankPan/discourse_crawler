In my react front-end I am accessing the motoko backend functions by this line of code `import { mytodo_backend } from "../../../declarations/mytodo_backend/index";`, locally everything is working fine and i  can persist the data to the backend without any problem, but after deploying the front-end appears to just be working on its own and not connect to the backend at all. The project is a simple todo dapp. [This is the link to my github repo of the project.](https://github.com/iamenochchirima/IC-ToDo).

Is the `@dfinity/agent` package on the latest version? It could be the same problem as in the same thread where calls don't work to the old URL

The `@dfinity/agent` package is latest I updated it but nothing have changed. But I just saw this error in the browser console on the deployed front front-end.

```
dex.js:2 Refused to connect to 'https://icp0.io/api/v2/canister/jz3aw-xqaaa-aaaal-qbyna-cai/query' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://ic0.app https://*.ic0.app".
```
If I try to access my front-end  at `.ic0.app` I am getting 404 error. How can I fix this?

In your frontend assets/source you should find one or two files called `.ic-assets.json` or `.ic-assets.json5`. These contain content security policy headers that are most likely still only targeted at `ic0.app` instead of `icp0.io`. Replace those with the headers from the updated starter template [here](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/src/dfx/assets/new_project_node_files/src/__project_name___frontend/assets/.ic-assets.json5). Then, if you're not on dfx 0.14 yet, redeploy your asset canister with `--mode reinstall` to force-update the headers

Fixed, I just replaced those files and redeployed. Thank you so much.
