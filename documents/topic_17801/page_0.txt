In Las Vegas for CES? I'm at CES this week, and would love to meet up with you if you are in town for the conference as well. 

I'll be at Aria, the lobby bar, **Saturday between 2pm and 3pm** - stop by and say hi! We can have a chat about grants, SNS or anything else IC related, or just network and have some fun.

If you want to meet up at a different time, let me know. This is a personal trip (not a business trip), so I do have stuff planned for the week, but can be flexible most days during CES.
