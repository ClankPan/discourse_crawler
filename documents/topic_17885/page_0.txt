m1 mac 
bitcoin-core running locally
port 8333 is default port ... has been running several months without issues
set dfx.json to port above 

fails on: 

basic_bitcoin % dfx deploy basic_bitcoin --argument '(variant { Regtest })'

console log is here

`error occurred: Failed to find tool. Is `clang` installed?`

Sounds like a problem with your machine's setup to me. Can you make sure that clang is available?

It's pretty common to have rust canisters be too big. There's a few things you can try. Probably easiest is `cargo install ic-wasm`, which will try to remove unused code from the wasm before uploading. Next is to gzip the wasm before uploading it. This requires a custom build script and you should be able to find more info about it in [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/http-error-status-413-payload-too-large/1705/15) or [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/bug-since-upgrading-to-dfx-v0-12-running-into-failed-to-install-wasm-the-replica-returned-an-http-error-http-error-status-413-payload-too-large/16459) thread.

thanks  got things working by compressing wasm and rolling back dfx 12.1. -> dfx 12.0

i was not able to install ic-wasm 

some issues may be from using a M1 mac
