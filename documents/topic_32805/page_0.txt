I was searching some reference on the IC portal to help someone on discord and noticed that few links have no effect. 

On https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec the following links do not lead to any particular section.

[https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-stop_canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-stop_canister)
[https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-start_canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-start_canister)
[https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-canister_status](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-canister_status)

Don't know if it's an issue with those links or generally speaking so thought about reporting.

Ah yeah I guess those are deadlinks, guessing it should point for example to: [https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-method-canister_status](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-method-canister_status)

The links are indeed broken at internetcomputer.org. They're already fixed at the master version of the spec: https://khsfq-wqaaa-aaaak-qckvq-cai.icp0.io/docs and they'll also be fixed at internetcomputer.org once I sync the master version with internetcomputer.org.
