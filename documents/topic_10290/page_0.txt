I'm trying to use the new `Principal.fromBlob` method in the base library, unfortunately it seems like my version of the `Prim` doesn't include that yet, is there anyway to update it? I'm on dfx `0.8.4`  and moc `0.6.11` and use vessel to fetch the base library from `master`.

The odd thing is that the method is shown in the documentation, but only available on `moc 0.6.20`, while `dfx 0.8.4` ships with 
- `moc 0.6.11`
- some version of the base library (there's only one release from `dfx 0.5.13` in the repo)

Would be nice if the docs enable to change to different versions of `dfx` to display the base library that's shipped with them, currently one can always only view the `master` branch afaik.

I was able to solve the problem by:

1. changing the compiler version in `vessel.dhall` to `0.6.20` 
2. running `vessel bin `
3. copying the files in this directory into `dfx cache show`

dfx 0.8.5 is out and should support the primitive, but you might still need to patch the base lib (I think it might not include that commit).

DFX_VERSION=0.8.5 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"

Thanks Claudio, that's way easier! Is there a way to now what release of the `base library` `dfx` ships with? Why is there only one release, wouldn't it be nice to have releases in the `base library` repo that point to the dfx version, too?

The compiler should be packaged with the commit of base listed here.

https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/0.6.20/nix/sources.json#L67

I'll see if I can update the tags on motoko-base.

And yes, this should be easier...
