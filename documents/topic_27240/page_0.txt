I am deploying an example dapp. When I execute `dfx deploy`, I receive this message on my Mac. Why would this appear?

`dfx wants to use your confidential information stored in internet_computer_identities in your keychain.`

Dfx stores identities' private keys (PEM files) in one of three modes: plaintext, encrypted files, or in keychain/keyring. By default it tries to use keychain because it is the best tradeoff between security and usability. You can decide yourself which mode to use with the `--storage-mode` flag either in `dfx identity new` or `dfx identity import`
