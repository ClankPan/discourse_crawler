Hello, 

This message is to any *all* DEXs currently operating on the IC. I ask you (and your teams) to geo-block any and all USA users unless registered with the SEC, or CFTC. 

Here is an example of why I am recommending this.  https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-153... If there *are* DEXs operating on the IC and they are offering their services to areas in the US without registering or operating under a registered exchange I urge you to consider quickly geo-blocking USA.


https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-17/chapter-II/part-240/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR541343e5c1fa459/section-240.15c3-5


https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/chapter-1

https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/cybersecurity-enforcement-actions


"ICOs, or more specifically tokens, can be called a variety of names, but merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security."

"If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an "exchange," as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration."

Allowing for technological innovation isn't just a nice thing, it's also a legal requirement. The courts have to always consider the implications of their decisions, which is an incredibly hard thing to do with tech innovation. So using a DEX in most of the U.S. is still a very legal thing to do. Unless of course it is being used in a very obvious manner to break the law.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 03:18:34 UTC | #3

No shaking my head... This is where leadership does a *very* poor job of communicating. I have provided ample material that directly states, if an exchange wants to offer its services to individuals inside the USA then it *must* adhere to the rules and regulations and *they must* register, or again geo block/ restrict USA access. This seems to be an ongoing misconception. 

Unregistered exchanges whether they are CEX or DEX are NOT LEGAL in the USA plain and simple. *If* they follow the procedures listed in the links I provided they can follow the process of becoming a registered exchange and obtain a bit license, however, if they do not, they are reported, and then charged. I hate to say I told you so. So, please just geo-block the USA

-------------------------

jwarner | 2023-07-12 04:10:12 UTC | #4

I would discourage any person or company from taking legal advice from anyone on an internet forum. Consult with a licensed legal professional in your jurisdiction and act accordingly.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 11:04:36 UTC | #5

Lol this isn’t legal advice! These are the rules as they are written! It’s fine, I’ll report ‘‘em myself.

borovan | 2023-07-12 11:25:37 UTC | #8

Haha, he may want to remove the lawsuits that are anything to do with Kyle Roche.  I think we all know what happened there.

Also, inb4 he starts quoting from the Arkham "intelligence" report

he wants to tear down the ic with geo-blocking he must work for the lawyers taking away any leg the ic has to stand on the no money no power they planing something soon sept maybe

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 12:17:52 UTC | #10

These type of attack vectors are *exactly* the reasons why one individual would not be successful in this community. Especially, when they come from major developers such as yourself. I really encourage you to stiffen up your ethical standards as a major player in the IC. These types of responses are toxic to any work culture and environment. It actually creates a *hostile* work environment, and I ask you to be more professional in all of your community engagements. 

Also, no I am not going to quote the Arkham Report.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 12:31:49 UTC | #11

My goal here is to make sure these projects "play by the current rules" until regulators make it clear, and the process is evident. All I am asking is for DEXs to temp. geo-block USA users *until* they apply and register as licensed exchanges, *or* receive direct approval that they disclose to the community. Otherwise, they *are* breaking several rules regulations and codes of USA laws. Plain and simple, the lit. is very explicit in the process and what is considered. There really are no grey areas in terms of exchanges providing services to US users.  

If these types of circumstances continuously occur, the blockchain is only asking for more and more lawsuits, *just* because the community wants DEXs (myself included), yet they do not like the rules so they think they are subjective. When the rules are explicit. The enforcement of the rules is explicit. As I began studying for my own project, I began to see *nothing* but red flags. I'm not saying any of this because I want a piece of any lawsuit. I am coming to the forum owned and operated by DFINITY FOR A REASON. Because this is my attempt to speak with the community directly. I do not have *any* social media for personal reasons. This forum is the best way to express these things to DFINITY and the community at large without needing to be a popular IC member. 


Again, I'm doing what I feel is best for consumers, users, investors, and developers in the USA. There is a reality where several DEXs face consequences *all because* they completely ignored the very explicit rules and regulations around providing exchange services to the USA community. 

All it would take is to remove them from these geographic areas, apply for the proper licensing and follow the rules when providing services to the USA. Otherwise, please continue what you are doing *just* block the USA, otherwise, you will face the consequences. 

This is my attempt to be very open, and honest with the community and DFINITY and allow them the opportunity to play by the rules in these areas. Otherwise, small community members and developers will be the ones who pay these "prices", and have no real ability to change *anything* unless they follow the only path to hold individuals accountable.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-07-12 12:33:00 UTC | #12

You're the one spreading a fake narrative about class action suits against Dfinity when we know they were carried out to get insider information and competitive advantage.

What's the end goal here?  Try and isolate the US from the IC and then fork it and make your own chain to service that market?  Nothing would surprise me at this point.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 12:40:16 UTC | #13

I want to reiterate I am *NOT* trying to spread a fake narrative, this information is in the public domain. All I am doing is providing it as support for my claim, and why I am nervous/ want them to adhere to the rules *at the very least for now*. 

Attack vectors, unprofessional, inappropriate, and (or) provocative insinuations are not constructive feedback. As someone with your "Clout" in the community, I'd expect more.

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-07-12 12:46:18 UTC | #14

I'm gonna go make an "US-centric IC concern-troll bingo card", so all you guys keep up the narrative I want to get a full house!

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 12:51:26 UTC | #15

If moderators remove @CatPirate indefinitely for the same communication styles I expect the IC moderators to do the same with known/ established members as well. 

Again, this only demonstrates my point. 

I'll complete the steps I feel necessary at this point and be done. 

I will say this conversation has become extremely toxic and unproductive, and I hope you become more emotionally mature as you continue your developing journey. 

Best,

-------------------------

borovan | 2023-07-12 13:11:25 UTC | #16

Screaming "centralisation" and demanding censorship.  That's not a great look.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 13:25:29 UTC | #17

The community has already "indefinitely censored" other community members for the *same exact* style of communication. One I might add I see you carry in *most* of your conversations. In reality, all I am asking for is for them to play by the *same* standards "normal" users have on here. 

Just because you bought out SNS-1, and are now a known and well reputable developer in the ecosystem, does not give you the right to engage in such behavior. In fact, I would assume someone with your rapport in the community would act (again) more professionally, or at least in a civilized manner. 

Again, I am using this forum for *very* specific reasons. One of which *is* the ability to remove toxicity, such as personal attack vectors, and blatant disrespect such as that coming from you. 

I really hope the best for you, and your project, however, you are setting an extremely poor example, and demonstration of character. 

Take care,

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 13:56:20 UTC | #19

Well, when you find your investment and project you've been learning on, not following the explicit federal laws in the USA, and all I met with is disrespect? Yeah, it is a little upsetting. Because this is the *exact* reason why I have had several issues inside this community. 

Anything that does not align, is met with this type of response. No rational individual is able to make any progress if the community it operates in has communicative practices such as these. It's extremely unprofessional at the very least. 

I have been in this ecosystem since Genesis, and I have held an 8-year neuron for over a year. It only continues... Then when I attempt to present explicit federal laws and show how the IC is currently breaking them. Then I am met with "this is subjective", "you want to censor us", or "you want to destroy the IC". 

No, this is not what I want, however, you cannot claim to serve the global community, then in the terms and conditions have stated that they operate according to the laws of the area, and then NOT follow those laws. It IS a direct violation. I'm not sure why/ how this is met with such resistance. IT IS NOT ME making these laws. They are *right* there though. Will they change? Maybe... Right now, however, it is explicitly stated. If they *do not* geo-block the USA, OR file for the proper registrations the developing team *would be* operating, running, and providing an unregistered exchange service. This is (right now) against the rules. 

They can continue the project and offer it to any other community. However, if they want to serve the US community these are the rules. Again, I'm disappointed by this, and really want these services. However, if they do not follow the rules now, and are fined/ charged they will not be able to operate afterward. 

These DEXs are obviously unregistered exchanges operating and providing services inside the USA *without* proper licensing and (or) being a registered exchange. They are directly opening their investors and their end-users up to several violations. Which again, would fall on the developing team and the project be obsolete anyways. 

I'm not understanding how these *basic* business practices can be sidestepped with loose interpretations of explicit rules and regulations.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 14:09:19 UTC | #21

I don't know what to say other than you are *obviously* not reading the federal laws, rules, and regulations I *just* provided. I'm not sure an accountant is what would help you in these situations. The developing teams will need to retain legal counsel, not an accountant. 

I'll end the conversation between us, by urging you to *actually* read the material (I'll add more). 

Then I will be disengaging from the conversation between the two of us. Furthermore, I will *only* dignify a response to any individual willing to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue such as @jwarner has on several occasions (for example).

I believe this discussion should be concluded and locked. 

If the OP is keen on implementing GEO blocking for DEX's, he should directly approach the platforms. It's not Dfinity's responsibility to enforce geo-blocking, at least not until there's an official government mandate.

-------------------------

dominicwilliams | 2023-07-12 18:13:12 UTC | #25

@jsull9, firstly you make a case with an implied assumption, which is that all protocol tokens are American securities. That is a debate that is currently raging between the crypto industry and regulators, and many people expect this will take significant time to resolve – even though the SEC has taken a position, it remains highly controversial, even among their own commissioners and ex-staff.

One important industry view, is that tokens which do not derive value from a "common enterprise" (like FTT), but are instead created by a decentralized protocol, that forms a decentralized ecosystem that creates value, are not securities, but digital commodities. Many people would question whether a digitally-formed decentralized ecosystem/economy is the same thing as a common enterprise. Such tokens certainly do not grant legal rights or claims in the mode of an "investment contract," and even their purpose evolves with the protocol, so nothing is guaranteed. This does not look like any security ever seen or litigated before, and reflects why new legislation is needed for digital assets rather than enforcement actions. 

You fail to acknowledge the above debate is occurring and that questions exist.

Secondly, you present the Roche Freedman lawsuit, as though that securities action is indicative that your case is correct. However, this was based on the Arkham ICP Report, which has been shown to be professional defamation, and the lawsuit itself was apparently created in furtherance of the aims of Ava Labs (Avalanche), who financed them, to harm a disruptive competitive threat. The lawyers involved have been kicked off the very class action they created (their class action currently doesn't have a lawyer prosecuting it) and they are now being kicked off nearly all their other cases because of what their founder Kyle Roche revealed. I wonder why you support them in this way? The background is on the investigative journalism website, CryptoLeaks.info. 

You further list whistleblower lines for the SEC and CFTC, which gives the impression of making a threat or encouraging others to join you in asking those guys to come after the ecosystem. Can you give some more color on your purpose there, because if feels like FUD?

However, I recognize you might be well intentioned and allow benefit of doubt –

Basic questions:

1. Are you advocating that the DeFi on other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche et al also geo-block US citizens somehow?

2. If 1=yes, are you advocating that American citizens be denied access to all DeFi?

3. If 1=no, why not?

Next:

Currently the Internet Computer network does not provide canister smart contracts with a way to geo-block different jurisdictions:

1. Are you suggesting that the web UX of DeFi projects detect the location of the user, by asking for their location from the web browser, and act accordingly? This would degrade the user experience worse than the Accept Cookies dialog, since the user will be asked for the permission, and sometimes to update their system settings, and a lot of people will be alarmed Or;

2. are you suggesting that the Internet Computer network should provide the country of a web user (derived from the IP address they use to interact with the boundary node) to canister smart contracts so they can make regulatory decisions (this feature is already being discussed)? A downside of this is that smart contracts could discriminate against users based on their location.

i.e. what are you precisely advocating for?

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-07-12 19:11:10 UTC | #28

First, let me start by thanking you for the respect given in your response. Thank you for not trying to diminish my objective or, belittle me as a person. I will admit and note, that I can see why other community members may *think* I am aiming to be malicious. Let me be perfectly clear I *am not*, and this IS NOT my objective. I have an 8-year neuron, and I am and have always been an extremely big fan of the IC blockchain. 

However, my objective here is to represent what *I personally* feel is best for the blockchain and ecosystem. I am not, nor do I plan on going on *any* of the social media platforms to start some sort of malicious campaign. I don't have the bandwidth, nor the truly vindictive spirit which some might portray I do. My tone may seem more aggressive because as you can see the community hasn't *exactly* allowed room for healthy discussion.

I do, and have acknowledged this in previous [posts](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/regulatory-concerns-and-unsolicited-feedback/21250/34) openly agreed that this is still ongoing. My major concern as discussed in this post, was that soon we may not have *any* ability to buy, sell, or deposit ICP in certain jurisdictions IF the exchange Coinbase (which has a CEX monopoly over the ICP token in my area). This led to a nerve-wracking reality that for the sake of time I will not repeat, but encourage you to perhaps take the time and consideration to read.

Secondly, the lawsuits are in the open domain and were *not* meant as a means to prove my claim in that manner. I provided them to shed light on these extremely expensive lawsuits that have already occurred. I uploaded perhaps a lot of irrelevant material. However, there was no intention to "threaten", or support the lawsuit claims. This was simply to show the ramifications. Then, show the *only* ways (as a regular investor, developer or end-user) can *actually* hold any developer team accountable. These are the steps in certain jurisdictions. Which again, is not my objective, however, there does not seem to be (as of yet) appropriate ways to handle these situations besides reporting them. 

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:25, topic:21304"]
Basic questions:

1. Are you advocating that the DeFi on other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche et al also geo-block US citizens somehow?
[/quote]

If they have similar DEXs such as those built on the IC then yes. I would advocate that *as of right now* they *should* (for their own safety and investors) geo-block USA. Is this essentially a crypto ban and completely against the industry? Of course, it is. However, again I provided all (maybe too much irrelevant) information of individual cases where [the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-153) tries to prove points. Do I *personally* believe that this is right? NOT AT ALL. However, as of right now, this is what *should* happen to protect not just users and investors, but really the developing teams. I am not a bloodhound for the SEC of CFTC. I can clearly see they are bloodhounds though. 

I am not saying any of this to "taint" the IC ecosystem. I *only* have ICP tokens period. I am not invested in *any* other blockchain. I am no longer investing in *any* crypto *until* the terrible legislation is resolved. 

This is (again), why I am trying to advocate on the IC. I do not want several other projects to end up in the same way. As of right now, several DEXs *could* be at risk, and in the example provided, it appears they settled *just* to avoid a long and painful court suit. 

I am advocating for the betterment of the ecosystem, and that unfortunately, these DEXs should *not* be offering their services to USA users *right now*. I cannot speak and will not try to speak for any other crypto because I do not own them. If these DEXs get charged and end up stuck in legal battles it just does not seem plausible.

This is where, as a student, with a limited technical skill set, I will humbly admit I cannot nor will not give a definitive answer. I am humble enough to admit there are several more prominent developers (like yourself) who can *try*. However, I would urge and recommend you start to seriously experiment with possibly either. I just to see what works for now. This is 100% a bandaid. Although, if the industry sentiment is right and proper legislation is enacted then a bandaid is all we need to *stop* engaging in *anything* that *could* continue to jeopardize the IC blockchain and limit the use of its utility token or services. 

To summarize, I want to continue learning, developing, and utilizing the ICP utility token. However, that reality seems to be in jeopardy. I am not causing any commotion to disrupt the blockchain. I am pressing the IC to uphold *the best* practices in the ENTIRE industry to set the example of what REAL TECH can accomplish. I do not care if ETH, Solana, OR Avalanche succeed. Personally, I hope they do not (except ETH) In good spirits, I do not vindictively wish this upon them. However, IF tomorrow they all are charged with these exact things and are dismantled I would not cry over it. Especially if the IC does the necessary work to not just "show", but set the new industry standards. 

I want ICP tokens to stay on any and all markets so I can continue to invest, learn, and develop on, *only* the IC. I feel this is *how* that happens. Do I like it? Absolutely not. How else can *we* make it happen.

I believe you are well intentioned, but I don't believe you are making your argument in a productive way. Posting your interpretations of the laws and asking people to act according to your interpretation will get you these types of responses. 

[quote="jsull9, post:19, topic:21304"]
Then when I attempt to present explicit federal laws and show how the IC is currently breaking them.
[/quote]

The laws are available for everyone/anyone to read when starting their project. It is up to each individual person/company to hire a legal professional in their respective jurisdiction who will hopefully provide legal advice based on the persons/companies specific circumstances. If a lawsuit arises, the attorneys will present their cases before a judge who then interprets the laws taking into account the arguments from all parties and makes a decision. The judge interprets the law based on that specific point in time, given the specific circumstances of case, after hearing all of the evidence. That is a VERY basic functioning of a court.

Coming on this forum, and saying these laws apply to a blanket number of projects without any in-depth knowledge of the projects themselves, and asking them to take action based on what you THINK the laws mean is a bit reckless, in my opinion. 

There is a place, and there are people, who tell companies they need to shut down operations in specific jurisdictions for violating laws. Again, while I believe you are well intentioned, that person is not you, and that place is not this forum.

You're making the statements below and it sounds like you're accusing these projects of violating laws. If you have no evidence of that, and haven't proven it in court or can't prove it in court, be VERY careful. That's how defamation cases start.

The only ways as of right now are through the channels I provided. Again, I am not a fan of these and everyone is assuming I am. It is making the whole conversation rather emotionally provoking. On the one hand, you tell me that if I do not like the way the blockchain is going I need to start making waves and put in the "sweat equity". But, because it is not in the way *you* think is proper, or because it is the narrative *you* agree with you try to make me submit. Then others using emotionally immature childish tactics instead of engaging in a meaningful debate you attempt to silence me with *no other options* then exactly what, and why I posted what I posted.

I'm not trying to make you "submit" to anything. I'm just saying I don't think it's the most productive way to get your point across or accomplish the goals you say you're trying to accomplish. But hey, you do you.

Again thank you for being an individual who speaks to me with a level of respect anyone *should* receive.

This message is to any *all* DEXs currently operating on the IC. I ask you (and your teams) to geo-block any and all USA users unless registered with the SEC, or CFTC.

anyway, are you a lawyer? what is your authority on this issue and why should anyone listen? most of the links posted are fluff that literally don't tell us anything. the SEC isn't a lawmaker the commission is responsible only for civil enforcement and administrative actions.

> “If a platform offers trading of digital assets that are securities and operates as an “exchange,” as defined by the federal securities laws, then the platform must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange or be exempt from registration.”

I think it's pretty well established at this point that none of these people can tell us if a digital asset is a security or not. Why? Imo, because they're not by traditional standards. They've been repeating these same lines for years at this point and have provided no guidance on the issue.
