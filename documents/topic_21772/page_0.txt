## Overview

Status: Paused
Project Type: Cooperative/Contest - Multiple workers can submit work and the bounty is shared
Time Commitment: Days
Experience Level: Beginner - Intermediate
Size: USD 5'000 in ICP (at time of distribution)
Deadline: -

## Description

Inscriptions are arbitrary data associated with a specific Satoshi. Inscriptions can be used to create Bitcoin NFTs and overlay protocols such as BRC-20. In this bounty, you'll implement a canister to inscribe arbitrary data using threshold ECDSA.

Regular inscriptions use Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR), which requires Schnorr signatures. The Internet Computer, however, does only support threshold ECDSA for now, and you need to fall back to using Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH). There was a small prior bounty to create a [Proof-of-Concept for inscribing using P2WSH](https://gist.github.com/bodily11/58773d64b9d0e3e8a18a81ae665fa44e). Currently, these inscriptions won't be indexed by [Ordinals.com](https://ordinals.com) and [hiro](https://hiro.so), but there is an [open pull request to ord](https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2192).  

## Requirements

- Should have an API to inscribe arbitrary data up to the max size.
- Should be able to hold ordinals in custody to inscribe
- Should be able to take fees from Bitcoin transactions
- Should provide a launchpad frontend

## Acceptance Criteria

- Service Canister and frontend deployed to the Internet Computer
- Proper Readme, see [here](https://github.com/dfinity/grant-rfps/blob/main/repo-checklist.md#blue_book-create-an-informative-readme)
- Open Source license (MIT or Apache-2.0)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality
- Code quality
- Design/UX

## How to participate?

Hi @domwoe 

I'd like to work on bounties again, but I see that the deadline for this one was for 10th of september. Is it still possible to work on it ? If yes are you going to extend the deadline?
Same questions for BNT-10 and BNT-11.

Also if I understand correcly everyone can submit work before the deadline and then the bounty is shared (i suppose based on the quality of each submission).

Thank you

Hi @sardariuss,

I appreciate your interest. Since there's no submission to the bounties yet, we are accepting late submissions.

Yes, that's correct.

Hi @domwoe,

I've noticed this morning that the [pull request](https://github.com/ordinals/ord/pull/2192) has been closed (not merged, unless I'm mistaken). So is it actually worth working on this bounty? Adding @bob11 because he seemed the most involved on this topic.
