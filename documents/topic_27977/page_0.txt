Some proposals evoke discussion.  Even boring ones.  Can we have some way of having a default location for discussion on every proposal, please?  The same applies to [dx features](https://dx.internetcomputer.org/).


- It wouldn't be nice to spam the forum with placeholders made just in case some proposal or dfx feature needs discussion.
- But given a proposal, it should be possible to click a link on the proposal that opens a place for discussion.

If it helps I do my best to link a discussion to every Governance and SNS & Neuronsâ€™ Fund proposal in the dev discord and NNS telegram group:
[https://discord.gg/SHYHne8SHZ](https://discord.gg/SHYHne8SHZ)
and
[https://t.me/DFINITY_Gov](https://t.me/DFINITY_Gov)

Also a reddit (perhaps for posterity!):
[https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity_governance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dfinity_governance/)

Yeah, that is my preference as well.  All of my proposals always start with discussion on the forum and if it becomes an NNS proposal I always link the forum discussion.  I really appreciate when others do it this way too, including the technical proposals such as replica version management.  The RVM team is really good about linking the forum in their replica proposals and it becomes a great place for conversation during the voting period.  I really wish this were a formal part of proposal submission where the conversation always starts on the forum (or other suitable location where discussion is possible) and the proposal is required to include a valid link.

Nice suggestion. @rvanasa just added an encouragement to the submission process:

If a proposal has no discussion yet and you want to start one, just start a discussion and ping me so I can add the link to the proposal

Where did you add this feature?  Can you please send a link to an example?
