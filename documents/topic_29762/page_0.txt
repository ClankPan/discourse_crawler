When in docker, running the sns-testing repo, I get this:

![image|690x234](upload://lcIVz5R4hHf8MPqPFYA3smqwI24.jpeg)

Do I need to add this?

@jamesbeadle I'm looking into this as well as other sns-testing related issues, I'll let you know when there's an update

@jamesbeadle I wasn't able to reproduce this issue. However I just updated sns-testing to fix another of other issues, and it's possible that this was downstream of one of those. Could you try pulling main and trying the instructions again? (including `./install.sh` as the version of DFX used has changed)

I believe what's happening here is you're running `dfx deploy --network=local`, trying to deploy your OpenFPL canister, from inside the `sns-testing` container. The result is that it's trying to deploy the test canister and it's failing because you haven't run `./setup-locally.sh`. 

The easiest way to get out of this is to just do the sns-testing stuff outside the docker container. This will allow you to use your existing development environment to deploy your dapp canister. I haven't tested these steps, but they should be approximately correct.

Step 1 (get sns testing): 
```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing.git # clone sns-testing
cd sns-testing
bash install.sh
``` 

Step 3 (in a new terminal in the sns-testing directory)
```
DX_NET_JSON="${HOME}/.config/dfx/networks.json"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "${DX_NET_JSON}")"
cp "$DX_NET_JSON" "${DX_NET_JSON}.tmp" 2>/dev/null  # save original config if present
echo '{
   "local": {
      "bind": "0.0.0.0:8080",
      "type": "ephemeral",
      "replica": {
         "subnet_type": "system",
         "port": 8000
      }
   }
}' > "${DX_NET_JSON}"
./bin/dfx start --clean; \
mv "${DX_NET_JSON}.tmp" "$DX_NET_JSON" 2>/dev/null  # restore original config if it was present
```
You may have to write this to a file in the sns-testing directory and then run the file

Step 5: In the other terminal, set the icp-xdr rate
```
./set-icp-xdr-rate.sh 10000
```

Step 4:  Deploy your canisters and make a note of the canister IDs

Step 5: Edit the `sns_init.yaml` file in sns-testing to your liking, and make sure your canister IDs are listed under `dapp_canisters`

Step 6: Deploy the SNS and participate
```
./let_nns_control_dapp.sh
./propose_sns.sh

NUM_PARTICIPANTS=100
ICP_PER_PARTICIPANT=10000
./participate_sns_swap.sh $NUM_PARTICIPANTS $ICP_PER_PARTICIPANT 
```

Step 7: Check http://qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai.localhost:8080/ and see your project

If you make SNS proposals, you can get the neurons that participated to vote on them with this command:

```
./vote_on_sns_proposal.sh \
    61 `# Simulate this number of SNS users' votes. TODO: determine the smallest possible value that will work here` \
    2  `# Proposal ID` \
    y  `# Vote to adopt this proposal`
```

You may also need to install `yq` and `bc`

Hi Andre,

Many thanks for your time earlier this evening. 

The command for installing yq and bc were:

- snap install yq
- sudo apt install bc

The steps outlined above successful deployed OpenFPL in it's post sns state.

Thanks,
James
