It was a blast presenting BOOM DAO at DFINITY Global R&D on Wednesday July 26th.

This presentation of BOOM DAO by @atomikm will provide viewers with a comprehensive understanding of the gaming infrastructure being developed and widely adopted by a growing number of gaming developers and projects within the ICP ecosystem.

Here is the youtube video on DFINITY's Youtube channel:

Very few people have been and are dedicated to the IC as @icpmaximalist has been until now and from the beginning. To describe a SNS designed by him and his partners as an attempt to grab easy money is clearly a symptom of some recency in the ecosystem (it is not a critic, of course). Let us seize the opportunity to give some support to these "project angels" rather than disgusting them by suspecting them of being rug pullers or something like that. For the IC's wellness, I hope they will have massive support.

@icpmaximalist 

Given the importance of C++ in game development, I wanted to reach out to ask about your plans for C++ support.

I created a C++ CDK, [icpp-pro](https://docs.icpp.world/) which is gaining traction,  with 10k downloads. 

I am not a game developer, I play in the AI space, with LLMs and such, but I am interested to see if there is a potential synergy.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or would like to chat.

Boon DAO is supposed to be similar to an [Autonomous World](https://ethglobal.com/events/autonomous) for me.

Logic verifiability
Composability
Permanence
Interoperability

Have you ever thought of an autonomous world?

Hello @Roman, it has been a while since our last communication. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for your kind words of support to the team and myself. 

Your encouragement means a great deal to us. One of the remarkable aspects of our unwavering focus on BOOM DAO's mission and vision, as well as the overall success of the ICP ecosystem for all stakeholders, is that anything that doesn't contribute to moving in the right direction is deemed irrelevant. 

Our priority lies in working TOGETHER to create the most exceptional blockchain ecosystem EVER. We value individuals who share a positive, collective, and collaborative long-term mindset. I am thrilled to know that we can rely on your brilliant mind. Thank you once again for your invaluable support.

It's fantastic to see you mentioning Autonomous Worlds. We have dedicated significant time and effort to explore and research this subject over the past few months, and we are incredibly excited about its potential. We are thrilled that you brought it up. We are well acquainted with the MUD framework and Lattice Engine, as mentioned in your link. 

Tommy and I firmly believe that Autonomous Worlds will pave the way for new gaming genres and redefine the gaming experience to a greater extent. In fact, we are in the process of transitioning Plethora into a digital society of autonomous worlds. While this is a massive undertaking, the work has already begun.

The Internet Computer provides an incredible tech stack that enables the development of fully on-chain autonomous worlds, and we are enthusiastic about using BOOM DAO to build the gaming infrastructure that will empower gaming developers and projects to launch their autonomous worlds in the future. Embracing such worlds fully on-chain offers countless opportunities.

Additionally, for those interested in delving deeper into the on-chain gaming movement on Ethereum, here's an article that explores the potential of Autonomous Worlds as crypto's next frontier. We are determined to drive the adoption of Autonomous Worlds on ICP through BOOM DAO.

Hi @jennifertran thanks for checking in.

We've already completed all local testing for the SNS a few weeks ago. We're currently doing our SNS Testflight and testing more complex proposals like indirect upgrading of canisters etc. Everything is going well and testing will be complete in the next day or so :slight_smile:

@cyberowl and @eimolad, you brought up good questions about governance and how contributions will be managed / payed.

Due to personal and academic background on both Computer Science and Management, I am a bit of a nerd (weird passion) on this topic, think that the IC allows us to do some really cool experiments in here.

I am currently leaving my full time job, busy with all the "cleaning up", but from September onwards will be full time for the IC (and hopefully for Obsidian Tears + Boom DAO). Really hope to contribute both my thoughts and code to this effort.

Don't want to go deeper, as it's off topic. But as soon as we have a forum / group thing, for sure we can create specific topics to do deeper discussion on these systems :+1: I would love that, really looking forward :star_struck:

-------------------------

icpp | 2023-08-02 15:18:48 UTC | #132

I voted YES on this proposal.

I just got out of a call with the BOOM DAO founders to discuss possibly synergies between the work I am doing around bringing C++ Developers to the IC and the BOOM gaming infrastructure.

The consensus was that:

* Number 1 priority is to create a C++ Agent that can be plugged into the Unreal Engine.
  * The [candid library](https://github.com/icppWorld/icpp-candid) for this is already available. It was build as part of the C++ CDK and externalized as a standalone library.
  * It was already on my roadmap to build this C++ agent, but it was not yet on my roadmap to focus on gaming and make sure it works well with the Unreal engine. Now it is ;-)
  * They recommended I review the C# agent as a reference. That one plugs into Unity and they said it works really great.
* An investigation is needed to gauge interest in using the C++ CDK to build C++ Worlds.
  * This is a great topic for discussion in the DAO community and set priorities
  * It is a bit of chicken & egg problem. At the moment there are not many C++ developers active on the IC, because the C++ tooling is just starting to appear.

Once the BOOM DAO is in place, I will definitely join the community as an active member and look forward to contribute.

-------------------------

StofAxeCap | 2023-08-05 16:09:46 UTC | #133

**BOOMDAOSNS Proposal**

 *Long story short, we voted **no**.* 

Our reason,[@boomdaosns](https://twitter.com/boomdaosns), is basic gaming infrastructure for the ecosystem. To allocate a max of **800k $ICP** is a bit much when the **total team & founding partners** are set to rake in **264k ICP** (max)


 While supporting projects building in the ecosystem is essential, the current proposal must be heavily adjusted before it should even be considered to pass. If this is meant to be a community initiative, make it one. **Don't expect 33% for the founding team & founding partners.** 



**We propose that the founding team & partners max out at 10% and the remaining to grants & hackathons. After all, this is basic infrastructure.** 



**MOST GAMES FAIL** 
You could dump millions into a game, and it can still fail. This is **much safer** for the DAO to allocate more through **grants** voted on by the community **instead of taking 33%** out immediately to the founders (locked after raise) 

**Voting power allocation should be revised as well.**

 We are partnered with several teams in Boomdaosns, yet we are speaking out about this. We are aware that this could hurt our relationship. However, it is our right to look out for the ecosystem on such a proposal that could end poorly. 

**We are calling for a proposal that is better suited for the community instead of extracting from it.**

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-08-05 21:44:22 UTC | #134

I see Boom DAO as an investment fund for the gaming ecosystem. Who is overseeing the grants and then investments into the gaming projects, will it be the owners of Boom Dao voting democratically or will designated person(s) or team be making the decisions?

Ya know… just my opinion but I think there should be a larger focus in gaming to rewarding the user. AI is about to displace most of human civilization, 100-years of training workers instead of thinkers. We now have the burden to entertain and occupy these folks time and subsidize their income. These people must be able to replace their jobs with gaming and make a living at it. I would say the focus should be on rewarding users to replace their current wages. What game or metaverse world would you quit your current job and play or work-unknowingly on for 8-hours where anyone/user could make a living wage at? I like the Hot or Not game and their focus on rewarding users as an example.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-08-09 13:15:08 UTC | #137

@atomikm  I am curious about the planned tokenomics of Boom DAO, specifically regarding deflationary mechanisms. Could you elaborate on the types of actions for which you plan to charge & burn tokens and the associated amounts? 

In the tokenomics sheet you shared, there is an assumption that 0.125% of the total supply will be burned in the initial year, increasing to 3% after 6 years. What are the underlying assumptions for these projections. Thanks in advance!

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-09 13:41:30 UTC | #138

We need you in AI. But yeah having that C++ Agent will be great.

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-08-10 02:05:56 UTC | #139

Hey Arjaan!

It was great meeting you in the call and discussing a potential Unreal Engine and Internet Computer integration. Your work with the C++ CDK is impressive and will be a major benefit to developers on the IC. We're excited to propose the C++ Agent to the upcoming BOOM Game Makers Alliance and gauge the interest of game developers in using it. This could open up possibilities for AAA studios to build fully on-chain games with Unreal Engine by leveraging a C++ agent to make calls to canister smart contracts. Your idea of using C++ to write World canister smart contracts was also an interesting one, and we look forward to gauging the interest it has from game developers. Really appreciate your proactive mindset Arjaan, looking forward to having you in the BOOM DAO community!

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-08-10 02:07:11 UTC | #140

Where can I find the sns yaml file? Thanks. I want to build a repo that has all the projects doing SNS to better analyze how each one is doing it diff and better see decentralization.

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-08-10 02:15:45 UTC | #141

Hi @bjoernek !

Thanks for reaching out, these are great questions. We spent a lot of time designing BOOM DAO's tokenomics to be directly correlated to the network effects of BOOM DAO's products. I will go over the various types of actions and spending mechanisms that will burn BOOM tokens. At a high level, BOOM DAO has two main products contributing to the overall burn rate: The **World Engine Protocol** and the **Game Launcher**. Both will contribute to the burn rate, although we predict that the World Engine Protocol will be the primary driver. I would recommend reading the Technical Architecture section of the whitepaper for more context about BOOM DAO's products. I will dive into details of their token utility below:

**World Engine Protocol:** As an expansive canister network interconnecting all games on the Internet Computer, the World Engine Protocol controls the entirety of game data and server logic of every game that integrates it. You could liken it to a single game server for all games in the entire world. The BOOM token will be integrated at a protocol-level within the World Engine similar to how cycles are used to power computation of canisters on the Internet Computer. BOOM tokens will be burnt to power computation, storage, and interoperability of games on the World Engine Protocol. As the network effects of the protocol grows, the value of the data stored in the protocol will also grow. 

Developers or players may stake BOOM tokens for micropayments to read/write data to and from the protocol, execute game server logic on the protocol, and import/export game data from one World to another World through the protocol. The World Engine Protocol was designed to burn BOOM tokens as it scales to run an infinite number of fully on-chain games. Developers and players leveraging the World Engine APIs would contribute to the deflationary effect on the BOOM token supply. We've modeled our burn rate projections on the assumptions that the World Engine Protocol achieves highly successful network effects. In reality, as with every other product on the SNS, only time will tell if the network effects will grow or diminish. These factors will have a large impact on the burn rate outcomes.

**Game Launcher:** This all-in-one game development platform reduces the time it takes to build a fully on-chain game from months to days. Developers can pay with BOOM tokens to unlock access to additional functionality, and players can spend BOOM tokens to access a range of premium features, enhancing their gaming experience. These premium features will contribute moderately to the BOOM token burn rate.

Some examples of premium features for developers include:

* Deploying additional World, NFT, and Token canisters beyond the Free Tier Limit
* Premium tools for on-chain game development
* Purchasing ads and promoting games on the platform
* Data migration across Worlds
* Access to enterprise features and technical support

Some examples of premium features for players include:

* Guild memberships and reputation systems
* Exclusive in-game content ranging from unique cosmetic items to power-ups
* Early access to new games or exclusive beta testing opportunities
* VIP events including game tournaments and developer Q&As

Overall, we anticipate that the World Engine Protocol will be the main driver of token burn rate over the long-term, and it's our core focus. Although the Game Launcher might contribute mildly in the short-term. However, there are still many variables and unknowns to consider, so we can't predict with certainty what will happen in the future.

Hi Tommy,
Thank you too for the chat and exchange of ideas!

One idea I have right now, to help me become familiar with the Worlds in BOOM land is to demonstrate the use of Conversational AI in the games. 

I am thinking of trying to build a World out of [this LLM canister](https://github.com/icppWorld/icpp-llm/tree/main/icpp_llama2) that  I got running over the weekend. It is a tiny fun LLM that can generate tiny stories, and it would be a cute, but really good reference example.

This is a must-watch if you still have questions about the project!

Those tools will **supercharge** the gaming ecosystem of the **Internet Computer**.

It seems like 👍 investment decisions will be made by the Dao, or Dao team leaders… it’s not just code that will be impacted by your Dao. Please elaborate when you have some time before you do your SNS. No rush, just don’t want to be forgotten. Thanks.

Hi @cyberowl 

Great initiative. We will share it very shortly on the forum.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-08-17 13:05:17 UTC | #148

Hi Arjaan

This sounds super exciting. Let's schedule a call to discuss your amazing idea at your most convenient time. Let's make it happen! :slight_smile:

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-08-17 13:07:19 UTC | #149

Hello @DHemingway

Great to chat with you again! Apologies for the delayed response. We wholeheartedly concur that prioritizing rewards for gamers should be a fundamental focus.

In the current landscape of the ICP gaming ecosystem, we find ourselves facing a classic chicken and egg problem. To grow the user base of ICP gamers, we need to attract a greater quantity and quality of games. Simultaneously, a larger and more engaged user base would provide greater incentives and opportunities for gaming teams to develop and operate within the ICP environment. At BOOM DAO, our strategy is to tackle this challenge by concentrating on both ends of the spectrum.

To elaborate, we are in the process of creating BOOM Gaming Guilds (BGG), which initially will function as adaptable smart contracts for any game to integrate. These contracts will facilitate rewarding all gamers listed within them with BOOM tokens. This represents a foundational step in establishing a comprehensive reward system for the entire ecosystem. It's important to recognize that this endeavor is highly intricate—there currently isn't a well-defined playbook for Web3 gaming or any proven case study to sustainably reward a Web3 gaming user base. We're exploring relatively uncharted territory, and we're eager to experiment in this critical area.

It's worth noting that each gaming team will design their own approach to rewarding users within their gaming experience. This is already a very challenging task, but it becomes even more complex for BOOM DAO as we strive to develop sustainable solutions for rewarding users across the entire ICP gaming vertical. We're addressing the challenges of the entire ICP gaming ecosystem. Ideally we would like to generate a massive pool of tokens from the whole ICP gaming ecosystem through a sustainable funding mechanism and cross game interactions.

The direction I've described is just one of the primary avenues we're exploring, yet there are numerous others that we're eager to experiment with. These approaches are aimed at drawing a significant number of gamers to the ICP ecosystem and providing them with sustainable rewards.

Regarding your comment on the decision-making process, you're absolutely right. The scope of decisions within the DAO is extensive—far beyond just coding. DAO members will be instrumental in shaping choices related to investments, products, roadmap, community engagement, partnerships, and much more. Even decisions mentioned earlier, like the reward system, will ultimately be determined by the community.

I hope this provides clarity on your question. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need further explanation or information.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-08-17 14:02:10 UTC | #150

Hi everyone

Today, we have some exciting news to share about changes to BOOM DAO's tokenomics and valuation that are all about the community. These changes have been carefully crafted to be a win-win for everyone involved, from BOOM DAO and the ICP gaming community to the broader ICP ecosystem. In implementing these adjustments, we also hope to establish elevated benchmarks for forthcoming SNS launches.

Our actions are always guided by a steadfast commitment to the long-term wellbeing of the IC ecosystem. Here is an overview of the decisions we have made: 
* The minimum fundraising threshold has been significantly reduced from 600,000 ICP to only 400,000 ICP. Upon reaching this revised minimum, the fully diluted valuation of BOOM DAO will stand at just 1,000,000 ICP. It’s a valuation we believe is very reasonable for a project that is actively developing the ICP gaming vertical, complete with a suite of functional gaming tools and protocols that are being adopted by an increasing number of gaming developers.

* Instead of asking for 320,000 ICP from the Neuron Fund, we're now seeking 240,000 ICP. This amount constitutes only 5.7% of the Neuron Fund's holdings at the time of writing, significantly below the average request. This move is a big deal for all of us, as we collectively recognize how crucial the Neuron Fund is in propelling the entire ICP ecosystem forward.

We hold a strong belief that lower valuations for SNS launches and reduced Neuron Fund requests will create a robust and sustainable funding mechanism in the long-term, while also driving much greater participation from stakeholders and investors in the SNS short term. 

These changes have been strategically enacted with the best interests of the community and the ecosystem in mind. Our aspiration is that they will serve as an inspiration for future SNS projects to follow.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2023-08-17 14:40:24 UTC | #151

I want to start by saying I appreciate that the BOOM DAO Foundation is actively reflecting on the SNS Configuration & making adjustments where improvement can be found. 

I haven’t yet had the chance to join this conversation, nor speak to the BOOM DAO team personally, but I’d love to get in contact with someone from the “Foundation” regarding the objective review of my SNS DD. Please let me know which person will be the best to contact.

With that aside, I wanted to point out that within the adjustments of minimum threshold and neuron fund contribution, there’s a slight (potentially unintentional) statistical variance in Neuron Fund Contribution. 

This change results in the Neuron Fund contributing proportionally more than it originally did (and excessively outweighs the public sale) under the assumption of minimum sale requirements.

320,000 / 600,000 = 53% of the Sale Contributed by the Neuron Fund

240,000 / 400,000 = 60% of the Sale Contributed by the Neuron Fund

IC_Maximillion | 2023-08-26 10:57:38 UTC | #155

In a earlyer interview it was sayd the SNS is being launched in august. Is that still the case or is it being delayed?

Edit: Another question that has came to mind, have you thought about rebranding?
If you look in to the future, if this gets mass adoption it would be great for it to have a smooth name and logo.
The names of the current projects are great, Game Launcher - Unity Template - World Engine Protocol.
BOOM DAO might seem alright for right now, but for the future and mainstream adoption, with brutal honest feedback i find it sounds a bit cringy, with the main fact that it is very important to be a DAO but for the mainstream user who just wants to play games it is not necessary to have it spelled out in the name. Dont get me wrong, they may care thats its a DAO but at the same time they dont, they just want to come and play, therefor it is unnecessary to have it written out in the name and rather use this space to create a smooth modern name. 

I fully support the project and believe it could be huge and very useful BUT, (i know this is not going to make me any friends) Keeping reality, the facts in head - imo, it needs a serious rebranding i dont see something with this branding take off anywhere far.  The Brand name and Image is the first thing the user sees and it has to represend quality.
Other then that, i support :slight_smile: 


Example of competitor branding:

Dropping the DAO might happen, adding a SNS or a Games might happen. Guess it will always be up for the DAO to decide it later on :slight_smile: 

I personally don't see anything bad with Boom DAO. Almost all names in that screenshot don't have any conotation to Gaming, they became a brand on its own. To me, I like to think, associate with Doom and how inovative and open to mod it was 😅

-------------------------

IC_Maximillion | 2023-08-26 11:43:17 UTC | #158

"Almost all names in that screenshot don’t have any conotation to Gaming"

Its not about that, its about the modern catchy name and about the smooth logo image - branding.
And its cool that you personally dont see anythig wrong with the Boom DAO name and image branding.
Its just a reminder, that current up to date stuff looks like the ones in the image above.
And it would be much easier to start with a smooth modern name and logo - branding, then having to vote and make something up when it already has started. But thats just my oppinion as 1 person.

And you also have to think about this, right now everything is new in the IC ecosystem, right now you and other projects that are building might be the only ones building in your niches. Down the road there will be more and more devs migrating to the IC ecosystem, and who knows how many of them and what kind of big teams and expertise they have - if one is slacking, they will simply overtake and replace the outdated versions that were created before. It has happend in the history of the internet with almost everything that was launched back in the late 90`s and early 2000`s, when the internet was new. But i wish the project nothing but the best :slight_smile: Just with the branding i have to duck under the table a ittle bit :face_with_hand_over_mouth:

IC_Maximillion | 2023-08-26 12:13:02 UTC | #159

Thanks a lot for your interest in BOOM DAO and for providing constructive feedback on branding. We really appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with us. Overall, BOOM DAO branding has received lots of positive feedback from the community, however it's impossible to please everyone. 

You made a lot of valid points that we will take into account, everything can always be improved, including branding. This is why we consider your feedback with careful attention. It's also worth mentioning that ultimately it is the community that will make these key decisions regarding branding and all other critical aspects to ensure the success of the project.

As mentioned in my previous message, we are always happy to schedule calls with the community. If you are interested to discuss any feedback you might have or ask any question, please always feel free to reach out to us in the forum or in private to schedule a call.

We want to thank you again for taking the time to share your valuable feedback, we take it seriously. We are confident that with the input of such community members, like you, we will collectively build a unique gaming DAO on the Internet computer!

CapuzR | 2023-09-04 22:46:19 UTC | #171

I've been following this forum discussion, and I'd like to give my perspective on a few things:

- Tokenomics related to the BOOM DAO proposals were aligned with the DFINITY Foundation standards and the community voted yes.
- Most SNS projects have requested large amounts from the Neuron Fund, the percentage BOOM DAO requested doesn't differ from the status quo. The amount they requested is smaller than other SNS projects.
- I'm a Founding Partner, and I'm not part of the team. Founding Partners vote as we want, independent from the BOOM DAO Founding Team. There will be cases where we vote differently. I'm not obligated to follow the Founding Team's voting decisions. I vote as a community member, with additional context and experience as I'm building a game on the IC.
- I hope that in the future even detractors will contribute ideas and code to the DAO to further boost the gaming vertical on the IC.

I'm personally happy to see this project succeed and think that it'll represent a huge move forward for the ICP Community and the ICP gaming ecosystem.

-------------------------

StofAxeCap | 2023-09-05 02:23:18 UTC | #172

@CapuzR I want to be clear, I wish the project success, I would LOVE all projects to succeed here on ICP. The reality is 99% of the entire industry is going to fail. It doesn't make sense to drain the treasury so fast. 

I personally see this as a cash grab. It looks like Tommy & Max are splitting 10%, then the rest of the 23% is divided up amongst 22 others on the website even though they are listed as individuals & teams. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong there, but that's what it looks like according to whitepaper + partners page.

It just doesn't look favorable for the community, with the founding team (2) & partners (22) getting 33% percent total with the added promise that 80% total funding will be drained for development, hackathons, and gaming guilds from the treasury. Voting power is substantially high, making it relatively easy for the teams to collude and gift each other grants & make hidden deals.  

If the community passes it forward so be it, they will be accepting that the DAO Treasury is missing 80% at 2 years.  We simply voiced our concerns, it looks like it's going to be misused. We called for an adjustment to the tokenomics & the voting power to make this substantially more fair to the ecosystem. 


This project could absolutely be beneficial for the ecosystem, I'm not doubting that. Just seems like the community is being extracted from pretty badly here. I hope to be proven wrong over time.

-------------------------

Thyassa | 2023-09-05 05:08:31 UTC | #173

I agree, the tokenomics doesn't match with their "building for the community and greater good" pitch. Hope this isn't smoke and mirrors, but warning signs are there...

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2023-09-05 20:50:12 UTC | #174

Hi @StofAxeCap ,

Someone posted a printscreen of this question in a TG group, I replied there, but thought it could be informative here too.

Below is a copy of what I wrote there:

------------

I personally don't see much to reply in there. Everyone knows the treasury can't be moved without the DAO approving it. If it will be spent in 2 years, and to where, it will highly depend on the DAO.

The founders are vested for 2 years, and then it's a monthly neuron that takes 6 months to dissolve. If that (money drain) would happen, won't they be the most penalized as well?

I am on one of the founding partners (Obsidian Tears) and there is no collusion, there never was. But by far, we are (and should become) the biggest users of the DAO, we should be interested in using, contributing and sharing gaming tooling and services. We have and is expected to be the biggest contributors. Involving games is fundamental to the success of a gaming DAO. Also some of these games can use the tokens to airdrop their own players.

I have made the math, power is distributed. I don't see why the worry, on other launches they have substantially lower amounts of tokens being sold to community. BOOM DAO has the highest amount so far (40%). There is no "surprise" or "future inflation" of where will those tokens go. It's on the community, the players. Now it's their responsibility to stake and steer the future of the DAO.

I will be there, hope you too will be there. After all, the best way to prevent misbehavior, is to be active 😏 If we all do our part, have no doubt that success and big usage of the network will lay ahead of us ☺️

-------------------------

StofAxeCap | 2023-09-05 21:11:36 UTC | #175

Yeah it's good to see that since I was kicked from the telegram for directing someone to the whitepaper

-------------------------

StofAxeCap | 2023-09-06 15:24:31 UTC | #176

Here is more confirmation on @icpmaximalist and Plethora scamming teams on ICP.

I'm sure they are worthy of trusting with BoomDAO...

Is there a reason why the “brigade” of people defending Boom DAO within this forum have not responded to these allegations, or the previously discussed topics?

It seems like now that the proposal has concluded, people are no longer interested in talking - as the chance for money is already here. 

I’m also curious about the abundant supply allocation to founders - does anybody think 40% of voting power to (2) founders is fair?

Why are you tagging me on this message?  How and why do you think I am associated with the BoomDAO project or can share whatever details you seek?

I’ve already shared, and will continue to share, that I think the BoomDAO SNS will be good for the ICP gaming community.  That entire effort including the leadership team have my support.

I know @icpmaximalist from the ICP Maximalist social media chat group community that he started shortly after genesis.  He supported my leadership efforts to spin up the ICPMN named neuron, which we later rebranded as Synapse.  Hence, I’ve worked with him on community facing efforts for a long time.  Based on these experiences, I think he is a man of integrity.  He has always followed through on the commitments he makes and he is diplomatic and fair.  He also never engages in conversations to slander others.

I have nothing to do with his gaming focused projects including Moonwalkers, IC Gallery, Plethora, or BoomDAO.  It’s not clear why you and others continue to think and claim that I have an association or can speak to them, especially after I have addressed this assertion many times.  From my perspective, it’s just another minor example of how there is a small vocal group in the ICP community that lives in a social media echo chamber and brews negative sentiments into false conspiracy theories based on bad or fabricated data.  It’s getting old and most of the time it’s easier to just roll my eyes and move on to something more important.

In my observation, the conversations have already happened and now these posts have turned into Defamation of Character and full on slander.  

Also, according to the prior posts in this thread, @icpmaximalist offered to have conversations with you to discuss your due diligence and you rejected his offer.  If you were truly seeking understanding and explanation, then it seems you would have taken him up on the offer.  Your claim for transparency through public conversation and his agreement to one on one and small group conversation doesn’t make you more credible and him less credible.  He has responded extensively in this thread to questions that have come up and he offered to clarify your questions further.

This seems really defensive for someone that is completely uninvolved. I find it very interesting that you’re referring to stating facts as “defamation of character and full on slander”. Telling. 

Your observation is quite clearly flawed - they have not responded to me since I contacted them last (within this very forum), raising concerns regarding discrepancy’s in their neuron fund request, or following up on my DD. 

I’m also curious where you’ve seen them address the countless people asking about the work they stole from Cipher Proxy? I’ve seen many questions within this thread & directed at them on social media’s, and no responses.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-09-06 13:00:36 UTC | #187

You saying that I’m associated with a project doesn’t make it so.  I’m involved with Synapse, CodeGov, CrowdGov, and ICPMN on Telegram.  There is nothing questionable about those projects.  Perhaps you disagree with things I’ve said or decisions I’ve made in the past, but that doesn’t make them questionable.  It just means we disagree.

Anyway, this conversation is off topic in this thread, so I’ll disengage.

-------------------------

Ivan | 2023-09-06 13:04:16 UTC | #188

Your involvement in governance itself is questionable let alone these projects which are rooted around it. You can’t have the social layer. Try Solana or ETH or something. ICP doesn’t need Yours or DFINITYs Politics. DFINITY should focus on the code and let builders innovate, not micromanaging them and wasting their time.


Do you know what happened with Community Funds? They removed the information from dashboard. Since you keep track of governance you could answer this?

I can’t answer these questions.  I didn’t know there were changes until you said something and I haven’t followed up yet to see what you are talking about.  It’s fair for you to ask questions like this, but you typically don’t just ask questions and seek objective answers.  When you attack people, it’s not surprising they don’t want to respond.

StofAxeCap | 2023-09-06 13:54:07 UTC | #192

Just want to say, I don't think your apart of BoomDAO.


I have said numerous times I think this project **can** be beneficial to the ecosystem, it's just not proposed to be beneficial to the community. It's proposed to line Max & Tommy's pockets by leveraging other teams names. 

Founding Team & Founding partners should drop from 33% to 10% 

Work through grants and perform to get paid. 

Adjust voting power collectively a bit. It shouldn't require 7% to override. Maybe 12-15% 

80% of the treasury could be spent over a few extra years.  Would be much safer.  Most games will fail, not saying BoomDAO would... Most games will. 

I feel like this offers a safer approach to making the DAO last much longer.

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2023-09-06 14:00:58 UTC | #193

Stof, Ivan, Phasma, Accumulating, and all coordinated attackers.

I have disclosed that there is an interest on the success of Boom DAO (as I am a founding partner), would you all be so kind in disclosing your interest? Do you have any competitive product, on the IC or outside (ETH, SOL, ...)?
Are you part of any game and you think you will be left out?

Whatever the reason, hopefully we can find a bridge where we all gain. A DAO is about sharing efforts, not fighting for some kind of supremacy.

Yeah, okay, fair enough. Please disclose your percentage of your earnings too, considering that's the heavy bias in you making the effort to even respond here. 

I know this will likely be taken down already, so I copied it and will be prepared to DM you if needed. 


I'm about to show plenty of info. I've already addressed concerns about tokenomics & voting power. It should be noted already how the founding team members and founding partners can collude. 

We basically support the project if the tokenomics and voting power are tweaked. It's crazy that if we suggest working, you freak out.  SNS payments should be milestone-based with targets. Not time to unlock directly. Maybe a mix of both.

Even brought up in 2022 by Psychedelic. Why? 

https://twitter.com/cipherproxyllc/status/1699159612178452788?s=20


ICP Max has a history of leveraging teams' names and ripping them off. It is in play again, considering several teams didn't know their project was listed on the BoomDAO Site. Dragginz didn't even realize they were partnered. Just screams integrity to me, you know? 



To respond to your question, thinking this is a coordinated attack, I will say yes. It is at the Community Fund. 


Would I be coordinating an attack? More so self-defense. Considering the history of ICP Max. 


We have a gaming project - it's not to build unity games. It's a multichain gaming hub for eSports & more by leveraging blockchain. It wouldn't be a competitor to BoomDAO; it would actually complement it & accelerate the growth of gamers. It's a matter of a lack of trust for ICP Max. (Given history)

 We also enable tooling to work with AAA games for tournaments, and faster payments. Which solves issues for the competitive gaming industry. Goated Gamer has a lot more it offers directed towards entertainment.  I previously was a Razor Streamer. I've connected the first eSports team to the IC. We have other eSports teams we are connected to. We are currently bringing several ETH teams over to the IC. We are partnered with Metaverse projects. I'm a core contributor to the  Outpost Metaverse project. I market ICP projects, artists, musicians, and content creators. We contribute a lot to the ecosystem. We also have an extensive multichain news app coming out near 2024 to highlight IC and other projects across Web 3. 

Just so you know, Goated Gamer DAO is separate from the Goated Gamer Platform. At this time, we don't believe we would leverage the SNS. 

The Swop compliments Goated & vice versa.

Accumulating.icp | 2023-09-07 21:23:26 UTC | #199

I find it extremely hilarious that you’ve resorted to attempting to portray people negatively to push through your point of view, after the Boom DAO team has so frequently said they’d love to have open conversation. 

Again, it’s not a coordinated attack, but rather a failure to accept criticism & reality on the side of your team, which has resulted in a buildup of people taking notice.

Nobody has addressed any of these concerns, regardless of the weight they hold to the success & longevity of the protocol, or the implication to the integrity of the team. 

I have absolutely no vested interest - if you did research you’d know I have a history of performing due diligence on every single SNS Project, and publishing them; all of which is completely unpaid work. Furthermore, while researching, you’ll notice I have **no** correlation to the people you’re accusing me of coordinating attacks with. 

Rather than assuming the worst of everyone - reflect. 

Is it more likely that 5+ unrelated individuals decided to collude on a singular SNS launch for “personal malicious reasons” (while not having products that would compete with BOOM DAO, while simultaneously receiving backlash for providing criticism), or is it more likely that 5+ individuals think you’ve created a potentially malicious, abusable scenario, in which you can extract liquidity from the Neuron fund & SNS Treasury (while refusing to answer questions once the opportunity to acquire money has arrived)?

Also again about the name / branding, on Avax the gaming hub is called Beam theyre launching a PS5 game "" on the blockchain (AWS) "" They are more popular because they have a lot of paid marketing. One is called Beam, and here its called Boom, cant it be something more smooth and original. I still cringe a bit when i hear it, but as its looking its just me thats good.
I just think it should go through some re-branding. As long as i get that cringe feeling, i`ll have to sit this one out and wont paricipate only out of fomo or for pity points.
The underlying idea sounds good tho and wish you all the best success 100%.

I've refrained from engaging in drama, it's not in my nature. But it's time for the truth to be shared.

It’s clear that you have a personal agenda against Plethora and BOOM DAO considering your close partner and CTO was previously a founder at CipherProxy. You’ve posted in this forum with malicious intentions. It’s clear you view us as a competitor and want to spread FUD about us.

CipherProxy scammed us and leveraged what we built to raise funds from investors. The IC Gallery version control history shows every code commit to the project since August 2021. CipherProxy never contributed a line of code to the IC Gallery. The CipherProxy team had zero Unity experience, so I ended up coding the entire thing.

Their team was inexperienced and junior, and they lacked strong work ethics. They were supposed to help us, but then they failed to deliver anything impactful. Instead, they just leveraged us for social validation. And then they did something dishonest. They leveraged the IC Gallery to raise a substantial seed round from investors (namely Psychedelic), basically convincing investors that they built the IC Gallery. That is why we kicked them out of IC Gallery. Because they went behind our backs and leveraged our product to sell to investors.

After that point, they always held a grudge against us. And we despised them for their dishonesty. They received $100K in grants from Dfinity and didn't produce anything worthwhile to help the IC community. They wasted everyone’s time and money. And then of course, they abandoned the IC ecosystem.

On the other hand, we kept building. We built Plethora, a real-time multiplayer game with thousands of players. And BOOM DAO, infrastructure and protocols to grow the ICP gaming vertical. Everything we build is open-source to help everyone in the ecosystem. Two years later, and CipherProxy has still failed to build anything meaningful on ICP. Instead, they spend their time attacking us. It’s clear that you’re colluding with CipherProxy and spreading malicious narratives. Your coordinated FUD is visible on twitter and on this forum.

We have posted a tweet that shares our side of the story. Max and I have been a part of the ICP community for many years, this is our passion and life-calling, and we hope to continue to build the ICP gaming vertical for many years to come.

[quote="Accumulating.icp, post:180, topic:21577"]
Is there a reason why the “brigade” of people defending Boom DAO within this forum have not responded to these allegations, or the previously discussed topics?

It seems like now that the proposal has concluded, people are no longer interested in talking - as the chance for money is already here.

In my observation, the conversations have already happened and now these posts have turned into Defamation of Character and full on slander.

To lighten the mood just a little, I'd like to remind us all that this is a post about an SNS sale that's hosted on a completely novel blockchain built by some of the best engineers and cryptographers in the world.

The larger crypto community might be better off for it :slight_smile:

Hey @atomikm thanks for this post.  I think it was needed and it is reasonable to defend yourself when false accusations are made.  I appreciate that you were diplomatic in your statements.  It can be very difficult, but please continue to remain civilized even when others are not.  Most people are reasonable and appreciate civilized discussion.

Sadly this isn’t a scientific paper this is a conversation about investments and governance.

Thank you for moderating the forums and ensuring everyone is remaining constructive and respectful. This forum has become very heated, and we'd love to focus on civil discussion. The DFINITY team is a class act, and we appreciate your work on maintaining this respectful space for the community to discuss.

Thanks Wenzel, I appreciate this. I'm not a person who seeks out drama. I just felt that our side of the story needed to be heard. I will continue to strive to be diplomatic and civil in my conversations :slight_smile: Business can be complex, and people can take things personally. I hope the IC community will continue to grow to be kind to each other, and support each other rather than tear each other down.

Civil and reasoned discourse is essential for progress and for gaining meaningful insights and information. Engaging in thoughtful conversations, respecting diverse perspectives, and focusing on facts and empathy, rather than resorting to conjecture and personal attacks, will foster understanding and create the potential to find common ground.

Based on what continues to happen on this forum and Twitter, I completely understand why the team has avoided engaging in these types of activities and is focusing on building. But, agree with you Wenzel the team did have to respond at this stage to reasonably defend themselves from the numerous accusations.

Hey guys.
This is my first post here.
I have been watching this forum since SNS started.
When Sonic was rejected because "trust me" and "I don't expect the market to grow". The foundation and community said it was to manage the Neuron Fund prudently. I personally have a large investment in Sonic so I was disappointed with the outcome but agreed.

Then a meme project called Ghost DAO got the Sonic fund.
Then Seers got SNS funding. This team had no development experience and was "censored" in the community. The users who were so eager to gatecape the other teams did nothing.
EMC was also rejected by the community afterwards, saying "please trust us" and "developers should not take SNS funds". And now PLETHORA, which has been contributing to the community for a long time, is being attacked with enthusiasm.

Well, DAO is based on the position talk of the community, so I may not be qualified to object to any outcome.
However, from an objective point of view, I think that the current community is contradicting itself in its belief in the proper use of the Neuron Fund and its actual actions.

I have seen forums that have criticized the Neuron Fund as being flawed in its setup.

But do you really think that is the real flaw? The users who remain now are people who have strong beliefs in ICP, and I hope they will rethink their stance on social networking.

I think plethora and many other SNS projects are a coordinated attempt at stealing from the neuron fund.

They do seem like it, not saying they are but is that Why DFINITY started obscuring details on community fund?
