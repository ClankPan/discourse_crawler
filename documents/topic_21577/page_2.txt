A [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/icircle_nft/status/1699723967408529899) has revealed that the latest teaser is actually an older game made by Mihai Morosanu. Fair enough, but it turns out he was [a developer](https://www.cointelligence.com/content/ico_list/fairwin/) for a crypto ponzi scheme called [FairWin](https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-10m-to-zero-in-10-days-eth-smart-contract-fairwin-is-empty). Why is the BOOM DAO team showcasing a game made by a crypto scammer? Is this person involved with BOOM DAO in any way, and if not then why this game in particular?

They apparently tried to deceive the community and later updated their repo as well

Hi Archetypal, I'm happy to clear up any confusion :slight_smile: 

The 3D assets used in Vogue the Explorer and Astral Rift are assets from Unity's library of free and open-source assets. This means any developer can leverage them for any purpose, because they are under open license. Unity purposely created these 3D assets to help game developers kickstart building games. Anyone can use the 3D assets for any purpose. The team behind Vogue the Explorer used these 3D assets to build a pretty awful game, and then tried to sell it on the Steam store. Which is pretty shady, but I wouldn't expect less from a crypto ponzi scheme. However, using these assets is legal, because the assets are under [Unity's Standard EULA](https://unity.com/legal/as-terms) license.

At BOOM DAO, we don't build games, we build gaming infrastructure. Hence, Astral Rift was built as a template to help game developers on ICP. It was not built as a game we intend to monetize. We have no intention of ever selling it. It's a free developer template. This is why Astral Rift is open-source on our [Github](https://github.com/BoomDAO/astral-rift) to help ICP developers have an example of a fully on-chain on ICP that they can use. The shining feature of Astral Rift aren't the 3D assets, it's that the project has a game server and database running entirely from ICP canister smart contracts. It leverages the World Engine Protocol built by BOOM DAO to validate and store everything on-chain. Anyone can download the source code and modify the game however they want, because all the code and assets are under open license.

I would recommend reading my tweet about Autonomous Worlds to understand better why we built the Astral Rift Template. We built this as an example game to help ICP game developers kickstart their game development on ICP:

[/quote]

Hi Tommy. I'm curious, what does "fully on-chain" mean in the context of Astral Rift?

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-09-08 13:17:01 UTC | #267

Hey LightningLad,

That's a great question! :slight_smile: 

It means the entirety of the game logic and data is 100% on-chain. Nothing is off-chain.

All game data goes through blockchain consensus and is stored in canister smart contracts. The game server and database runs from canister smart contracts. You can directly interact with the game's smart contract [here](https://5pati-hyaaa-aaaal-qb3yq-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=ldcxa-oiaaa-aaaap-abj5a-cai) and it has the entirety of the game logic and data inside the smart contract.

Anyone can create a frontend client to interact with the smart contract. These clients can be visually very different, one client could be a 2D game, another client could be a command-line interface etc. But they all interact with the same game canister smart contract, which is where all the game functionality resides.

The Astral Rift Unity project is simply a PC game client for the Astral Rift canister smart contract. The canister smart contract is where the real magic lies. It's where the rules of the game are enforced and where the data of the game is stored. Anyone could create another game client to interact with the canister smart contract if they wanted. 

We also host the Astral Rift PC game client in an asset canister for anyone to download, although you could also download the Astral Rift Unity source code and build the client yourself.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-09-08 13:33:55 UTC | #268

Thank you for the response. This is exciting stuff!

Especially this part, lots of potential here.

How do you feel about scaling the world engine at this point? I'm a huge fan of the multi-canister approach. Any cross-subnet scaling being considered?
 
Have y'all spoken with IC1101 at all? I know their original concept could benefit from something like the World Engine.

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-09-08 20:15:15 UTC | #269

No problem! 
Actually I have great news for you, because the World Engine Protocol already infinitely scales (at least until it hits the limits of its subnet :) ). We do this by creating a new user canister for each user that connects to the World Engine Protocol. This user canister stores all the data of that user. And the best part is that the user carries this user canister to whatever game they connect to on the World Engine Protocol. 

For example, if I connect to Astral Rift, it will store my data in my user canister. And then if I connect to Cubetopia, it stores my data in my same user canister. And if I connect to Paws Arena, it does the same, and so on. So essentially every user has their own canister on the World Engine Protocol, and it contains the data of every game they connect to. 

This is how we unlocked interoperability between games that wasn't possible before. Because now your user canister contains all your user data in a standardized way across all the games you play, and each of those games can grant each other permission to change data. So Cubetopia can give Astral Rift permission to change items/achievements/quests in Cubetopia, or vice versa. 

This also enables players to build on top of an existing game smart contract. For example, if someone wanted to create an Astral Rift V2 smart contract and add new functionality where you can mine for diamonds, they can simply clone the original Astral Rift V1 smart contract and then import all the existing users to the new Astral Rift V2 smart contract. Then any user connecting to the Astral Rift V2 smart contract has all their progress from the original Astral Rift V1 smart contract. 

We make this super easy to do on the Game Launcher [website](https://awcae-maaaa-aaaam-abmyq-cai.icp0.io/), it can be done in 2 clicks. You basically create a new "World" canister (aka the Astral Rift V2 smart contract). And then you can import all the rules and users from the other smart contract. And then you can modify it to your hearts desire.

It's novel functionality that doesn't exist on any other blockchain. In fact, it's never existed ever, it's a completely new use case for gaming. Only possible because of ICP smart contracts.

We're trying to avoid cross-subnet scaling because that would introduce higher latency for update calls, so all World Engine Protocol canisters are on one subnet. As well as all the NFT and ICRC collections that anyone creates from the Game Launcher website.

We used to keep up closely with the IC1101 team, the last time we spoke they were exploring building outside the IC. If they're still interested in the IC, then we would love to help them leverage the World Engine Protocol to bring IC1101 fully on-chain. At the moment, we're helping 6 ICP games transition/build on the World Engine Protocol.

Thankyou.

Yeenoghu | 2023-09-16 13:14:32 UTC | #280

Congrats Boom DAO on a successful launch! As the retired leader of a global online gaming community i am highly interested in the guild aspect of what you are doing. Guilds are a great way of grouping like minded people and attract players to games they may not otherwise have known about, especially if membership is incentivized. I did this back in the day by negotiating with local business owners for sponsorships. But today blockchain has changed much opening an array of possibilities for incentives that could be utilized. Looking forward to see how this develops. It would be interesting to come out of retirement and reform Alpha Defense Force as one of the first gaming guilds on the IC.

michail.rizos | 2023-09-20 13:23:56 UTC | #283

I tried to take initiative to list BOOM DAO on coingecko, but my application was rejected with the below rationale: "No trading activity found. Please resubmit the request for re-evaluation once the token is actively being traded on either a DEX or CEX". We desperately need liquidity.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2023-09-20 16:42:39 UTC | #284

Thatâ€™s the crazy thing about all of these SNSes.

They were meant to provide liquidity, but have actually drained ICP maturity liquidity. At least theyâ€™re sucking up ICP to lock in different dapp tokens, as otherwise that ICP would have most likely been sold on exchanges.

Thereâ€™s just an huge imbalance of supply and demand that hasnâ€™t slowed down even after the initial insider dumps and crash (token inflation & rewards)?

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-09-23 12:35:18 UTC | #285

Hey! 

First of all, I take this opportunity to wish you all the best for Sonic SNS! :slight_smile: 

Would love to schedule a call with you to discuss what are the best options for BOOM DAO community when it comes to adding liquidity to Sonic.

Looking forward to seeing Sonic turning into an SNS and bringing ICP DeFi to the next level. All the best for you and your team.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-09-23 12:44:35 UTC | #286

Thanks a lot for your message @Yeenoghu :slight_smile: 

It's so great to hear your excitement for Gaming Guilds. We are also very interested in bringing them to the ICP gaming vertical. The main objective is for any ICP game to be able to leverage them by easily and quickly integrating them. There will be BOOM token rewards as well as other ICRC token rewards for gamers participating in it. 

You can think of it as a user acquisition strategy for ICP games, as well as a community building tool, and for gamers it's going to be a ton of fun! Even more considering that the World Engine protocol will allow for cross-game interactions, which will open a new myriad of creative web3 on-chain gaming use cases. 

The community will obviously be involved throughout the process of creating BOOM Gaming Guilds (BGG), the best way for you to stay tuned and don't miss any announcement, is to join us in Discord and follow us on X.

Thanks again for your strong support, we will keep in touch as we progress on BGG!

icpmaximalist | 2023-09-23 12:46:31 UTC | #287

Hi @michail.rizos 

Proposals to add liquidity are coming soon, details subject to a community vote. Please let us know in BOOM DAO's discord if you have a preference for an ICP DEX. We are trying to figure out what is the community's preference and which DEX is likely to attract most of the liquidity and volume on ICP.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-09-23 12:48:14 UTC | #288

Hi @Antony :slight_smile: 

We fully understand. Just made this reply: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/upcoming-boom-dao-sns-decentralization-sale/21577/287?u=icpmaximalist

icpmaximalist | 2023-09-23 12:56:03 UTC | #289

Thanks a lot @michail.rizos for taking this amazing initiative. To be honest I'm not familiar with this topic but it's clearly something I will prioritize researching on next week. 

It's not just about BOOM token but about all ICRC tokens and the whole DeFi ecosystem on ICP. We obviously need to get all our ecosystem tokens listed on Coingecko and Coinmarketcap.

I'm not sure if we need more trading activity and liquidity first, or if we need IC DEXes to get integrated to these platforms. As I said I need to do some research. I'm willing to devote time to make this happen with other IC builders. I'm available to connect with anyone to coordinate. We definitely need all ecosystem tokens listed there, the sooner the better.

Hey Everyone, I was glancing at dashboard earlier and noticed that 80% of Boom DAO treasury has vanished overnight. Is everything okay?

![image|690x445](upload://kBWKRDnuqYqD4LvBkqCoSV472GA.png)


My friends have invested a lot on this project, especially after the 60% of the Funds were raised from Community Fund / Neuron Fund and was backed by DFINITY Officials.


Should we be worried?

[/quote]

Human nature is inherently evil and the fund is out of control, of course we may face another rug-pull. I think the SNS team should figure out a way to avoid this happening again, for example: each time the team can only drain 10% of the total fund and cannot drain again in 3 months, each project should at least runs 2-3 years.

-------------------------

Apollon | 2023-10-25 06:37:09 UTC | #293

Or maybe ICA and DFINITY management should be Defunded. They should be fired even.

Just to re-iterate absolutely no connection with Dragginz whatsoever.  Lots of red flags here.

I didn't actually realise they would have had the ability to drain the treasury like this.  I thought that was just for degenerates that had to buy their way to 51% first.

Unless there's an apology and the ICP goes back to the treasury (which won't happen), this project is done.

When generalised SNS named neurons which can each allocated a percentage of VP ( without rewards ) perhaps ? 

SNS named neurons for retail to follow that don't necessarily need a stake in the network the amount of VP can be debated on

Community should be able to enforce what the whitepaper says... And the whitepaper should say exactly when you are allowed to drain funds.
Imagine you run a star-up and you deceive your VC getting the funds into your pocket. You would go straight to jail.
DAOs should be exactly the same.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-10-25 11:05:54 UTC | #303

This is officially a problem, this is definitely not the right way to handle this amount of funds provided by the community. SNS needs to have controls and protections over things like this. The community may be fine with devs having full control over app code updates, but not necessarily the DAO treasury.

I don't see how the SNS system will be successful long term if it feels like a potential rug platform.

The upcoming BOOM DAO SNS decentralization sale sounds interesting, especially for those invested in the Internet Computer (ICP) gaming space. It seems like they're aiming to address some key challenges for ICP game developers.

Here are some key takeaways from the post:

* **Problem:** Lack of robust web3 gaming infrastructure on ICP hinders user and developer adoption.
* **Solution:** BOOM DAO, a collaborative DAO of ICP gaming veterans, is building a comprehensive platform to empower on-chain games.
* **Platform Features:**
  * World Engine Protocol
  * Game Launcher
  * Unity Template
  * World Template
  * ICP.NET Library
  * All open-sourced on Github
  * Technical documentation available

By creating a community-owned platform with tools, funding, and support, BOOM DAO aims to lower barriers for web3 game development and accelerate the growth of fully on-chain games.

**Resources:**

* BOOM DAO Whitepaper: [link to whitepaper 84] (**Highly recommend reading this before asking questions!** ).
* BOOM DAO Github: [link to Github repo 9]

**For Unity developers interested in exploring web3 gaming on ICP, the BOOM DAO Unity Template might be a valuable resource to get started.** You can find more Unity templates and assets for your game development projects at [unity templates](https://nextlevelgamingstore.net/unity-templates/).

Does anyone have any questions or thoughts about the BOOM DAO SNS and its potential impact on ICP gaming?

LOL, I see you are up to your typical smear tactics again @Phasma.  Like I've told you half a dozen times before, I don't use alt accounts.  Never have and never will.  I don't have time or interest in creating juvenile bullshit.  I don't know @nextlevelgamingstore and I don't spread BoomDAO propaganda.  However, I do provide feedback based on my personal experience when it is warranted.

**Great points, thedogles!** Boom DAO definitely sounds like an interesting approach to tackle gaming on the IC. Here are some thoughts:

* **Gaming as Onboarding Tool:** Absolutely, engaging games can attract non-technical users and introduce them to the IC and blockchain concepts. A rising tide lifts all boats, just as you mentioned.
* **Non-Wallet/ICP Play:** A solution that allows anyone to play without a wallet or ICP upfront would be a game-changer (pun intended). Frictionless onboarding is key to mass adoption.
* **Community & Collaboration:** A DAO focused on gaming development fosters collaboration and resource sharing, which can lead to stronger projects. Boom DAO's community-driven approach seems promising.

**Some additional considerations:**

* **Technical Challenges:** Developing high-quality games on the IC still has some technical hurdles to overcome compared to established platforms. Boom DAO could play a role in addressing these challenges.
* **Marketing & User Acquisition:** Even with a frictionless experience, attracting a large casual gamer audience requires effective marketing strategies to reach beyond the existing crypto community.

**Overall, Boom DAO has the potential to be a significant force in bringing more users and developers to the IC gaming space. Here's to a successful project!**

**P.S.** Obsidian Tears sounds intriguing! Would love to hear more about your classic-inspired game.
