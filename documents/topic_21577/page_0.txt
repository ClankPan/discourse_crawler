[BOOM DAO](http://boomdao.xyz) is preparing to launch its SNS DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale expected soon.

This post is a forum for the IC community to discuss the BOOM DAO SNS and ask the founding team and partners any questions.

BOOM DAO is a fully on-chain DAO that’s revolutionizing the gaming industry by building the gaming vertical on the Internet Computer.

Our three-fold mission is to power the next generation of fully on-chain games, drive mainstream adoption of the Internet Computer blockchain, and provide a collaborative hub for all things web3 gaming.

### Problem Statement

The lack of robust web3 gaming infrastructure in the Internet Computer ecosystem is a significant barrier for ICP games, preventing the onboarding of users, builders, and investors. The development of such infrastructure requires extensive resources, a skilled team, and substantial incentives. Current developers face steep learning curves and major barriers to build fully on-chain games, which have revolutionary potential but demand significant investment, technical support, and effective user acquisition strategies. A collaborative group of game professionals is needed to champion the gaming vertical on ICP and bring its potential to life.

### BOOM DAO Platform

To surmount these challenges, BOOM DAO assembled top ICP gaming veterans who have been building ICP games since genesis in May 2021. This team of experts spent over a year developing an all-in-one web3 gaming platform to empower a new era of fully on-chain games on the Internet Computer. As a community-owned DAO, we democratize game development, providing developers with comprehensive on-chain game toolkits, technical support, funding, gaming guilds, and effective user acquisition strategies.

BOOM DAO's products include:

* [World Engine Protocol](https://github.com/BoomDAO/world-engine)
* [Game Launcher](https://github.com/BoomDAO/game-launcher)
* [Unity Template](https://github.com/BoomDAO/unity-template)
* [World Template](https://github.com/BoomDAO/world-template)
* [ICP.NET Library (C# agent)](https://github.com/BoomDAO/ICP.NET)

All products are fully open-sourced in our Github [here](https://github.com/orgs/BoomDAO/repositories).
In-depth technical documentation can be found [here](https://docs.boomdao.xyz).

The SNS empowers collective governance and resource pooling, fostering a collaborative environment where all stakeholders are incentivized to contribute to infrastructure development and compound network effects. BOOM DAO's mission is not just to build infrastructure, but to advance the ICP gaming ecosystem, reduce barriers to web3 game development and accelerate the growth of fully on-chain gaming.

Here is the link to the [BOOM DAO Whitepaper](https://boomdao.notion.site/BOOM-DAO-WHITEPAPER-59bc2aa3380b4f86b01344da42157a24?pvs=4). Please read it before asking questions as hopefully they will already contain many of the answers.

### Funding Target

* As detailed in our whitepaper, we are targeting a minimum of 400,000 ICP to a maximum of 800,000 ICP.
* We are seeking 240,000 ICP from the Neuron Fund, which constitutes only 5.7% of the Neuron Fund’s holdings at the time of writing. This is significantly below the guideline that limits the Neuron Fund’s contribution to a maximum of 10%.
* We are selling 40% of the total token supply to the community in our decentralization sale. This is the largest amount ever allocated to the community in an SNS sale, and it will maximize BOOM’s decentralized governance.

More details about the distribution and SNS configuration can be found in the [Tokenomics](https://boomdao.notion.site/BOOM-DAO-WHITEPAPER-59bc2aa3380b4f86b01344da42157a24) section of the whitepaper.

We are excited to champion the gaming vertical on the IC and transform BOOM into the DAO for all ICP games!

I would be against BOOM DAO for the following reasons:

1. The team has only been established for more than a month (6.16 Twitter goes live)
2. Didn't see what they did. At present, the products they make are very simple，I don't think their current product can promote the development of ICP game。
3. no one uses it at all.
4. I think your product is not mature enough to establish a DAO
5. Why do you need SNS DAO? Are you short of money?

-------------------------

lixx | 2023-07-22 02:00:45 UTC | #3

At present, BOOMDao only displays the current game links of the IC ecosystem on the website, and has not seen any so-called basic game facilities that have been developed for a year.

-------------------------

lixx | 2023-07-22 02:03:02 UTC | #4

Another reason is that BoomDao just created Twitter in June, and without any product information, the foundation's Twitter promoted it. What does this phenomenon mean? Is there any interest relationship? Many IC ecosystem products have been working hard for a long time but still haven't seen any promotion from the foundation's Twitter.

-------------------------

lixx | 2023-07-22 02:37:51 UTC | #5

Far inferior to the progress of Inside Dark Studio project. The Inside Dark Studio is currently developing a model that can participate in any game project. But not as actively and profitably selling as BoomDao.

1. The team has been building game products on ICP full-time for over 2 years, it's one of the oldest teams on the IC.

2. The gaming infrastructure products that we've built are far from simple, they are some of the most complex products in the ICP ecosystem. We've developed them since the ICP genesis in May 2021 to solve issues related to hosting game builds in canisters with brotli compression, WebGL browser caching, Unity wallet authentication, universal game database, C# agent for Unity direct communication with canisters, client-side prediction, real-time movement, on-chain game server backend, NFT and ICRC-3 deployment and services for payments and staking. The very first piece of infrastructure we built over a year ago is used by nearly every single gaming project on ICP and can be referenced here: https://bit.ly/44PVsRA 
We've consolidated many of these products into our open-sourced Game Launcher, World Engine protocol, World Template, Unity Template, and ICP.NET Library, which are the culmination of over a year of R&D. Many of your favorite ICP games have leveraged and will continue to leverage our infrastructure. And we're thrilled to continue building tools and infrastructure that support all games in the ICP ecosystem.

3. Refer to the above.

4. A world-class DAO building critical gaming infrastructure and gaming protocols to foster network effects across all ICP games and advance the gaming vertical on ICP is the perfect fit for an SNS.

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-07-22 04:08:11 UTC | #9

BOOM DAO will offer 40% of the total token supply to the community in our decentralization sale. This is the largest amount ever allocated to the community in an SNS sale, and it will maximize BOOM’s decentralized governance. We've also allocated 23% to founding partners in the ICP gaming ecosystem, which includes all the well-known ICP gaming projects and teams building amazing games on the Internet Computer. Our mission is to align incentives for collaboration and become the DAO for all ICP games. The token allocation of BOOM DAO was designed to be the most decentralized SNS sale to date.

-------------------------

icprobot | 2023-07-22 05:09:40 UTC | #10

1. I admit that Plethora has been developed for a long time, but it is another project, and the boomdao project is only a month old.

2. Please list which ICP game projects use your products, I did not see this in the link you gave
3.

> 1. A world-class DAO building critical gaming infrastructure and gaming protocols to foster network effects across all ICP games and advance the gaming vertical on ICP is the perfect fit for an SNS.

What does this sentence mean? Why do you have to be on SNS? this doesn't convince me

4. In my opinion, your product is like a game navigation station

cyberowl | 2023-07-22 05:46:11 UTC | #11

Gaming is hard. @atomikm has been building on the IC for a long time. The world engine seems super ambitious and I don't fully understand it. However, I support this DAO because they understand gaming and the IC more than any other gaming team here. So it just makes sense to invest in it.

-------------------------

Tomm | 2023-07-22 09:23:57 UTC | #12

I don't understand the negativity in this thread.
The team is legit, they've been here since Genesis and created various communities and projects that still hold up to this day, a testament to their community involvement and genuine interest in the ecosystem's growth. 
Plethora is yet another proof of the team's capabilities, it's a very well-designed game hub that blends NFTs, and on-chain features ( even the ckBTC thing was fun with the spins and everything) - it shows the team is capable of scaling up their product to help the IC. 

I don't see why people are so hell-bent on pushing all kinds of SNS sales through and shoot down the ONLY gaming-related proposal rn. Gaming is one of the easiest ways to attract people to the IC, if the incentives are there and they sure are if BOOM DAO plans accordingly.

Furthermore, it's the only team positioned properly to kickstart the gaming side of things on the IC so yeah, I'm fully behind this SNS sale because it's one of those things that will actually be used and show people 'Hey look at this, this whole thing is built on the IC, fully on-chain dudes! '

-------------------------

caolw | 2023-07-22 09:29:08 UTC | #13

Like what project did they work on? How many real users are using it? Can I write html and then SNS 1 million ICP?

-------------------------

BlockchainPill | 2023-07-22 11:06:38 UTC | #14

I also don't understand the negativity in this thread.

The team behind the Boom DAO project is one of the oldest teams in the ICP Ecosystem. True OGs that have delivered on their promises & networked with pretty much all the ICP builders.

Developing games on the Internet Computer Protocol can prove to be difficult, especially when you lack the necessary documentation or are just stuck at some step.
If Boom DAO is going to streamline the process of building games on the IC by providing the required infrastructure & documentation, this is a HUGE plus for the entire ecosystem, not just the gaming sector.

There are plenty of games being developed on the IC and most of them receive too little attention. To unite them under a DAO could be the winning move.

I would bet that Web 3 gaming in 2024-2025 will be what DeFi was in 2020-2021. ICP needs to prepare accordingly.

Hi all,

My name is Tiago, wanted to bring a bit of a perspective of an actual user that has grown from a gamer on the IC into being a contributor to the gaming ecosystem.

First, I would like to make it clear that my opinion is biased as I am part of the founding partners and really hope this sale goes forward as I would like to contribute more to gaming on the IC.

My first usage of the IC was actually through games, like Plethora, but something as simple as Spartan, was already fun. Have played and beta tested with games like Eimolad, FaeFolk, Cubetopia, PawsArena, etc. I was impressed by how easy and comfortable it was to play online, and how it can all be sourced and controlled from the blockchain.

On January this year, I did the Motoko Bootcamp, in-person in Porto, and it was great. Some weeks later joined one of the games I was more anxious for: Obsidian Tears. 

I have been the Motoko/React Developer of the project since then and have seen live the many struggles they, and the ecosystem faces.

We don't have yet an "economy" on IC gaming. That won't come out of thin air. Mobile/App gaming only grew to the behemoth it is today when Apple / Google / Facebook gave it a system to make it easy to market, play and earn from it.

We (now talking about me, Obsidian, Plethora, Cubetopia, Eimolad, etc.) believe we need to solve this as a group, not as individuals. There are large benefits to all by having shared infrastructure, sharing interactions, shared token, etc.

I really see that what these big players did to the mobile ecosystem, could be what the BOOM DAO could do to the IC ecosystem.

We need to invest on infrastructure, make it easy for any game developer to publish on the IC (see Boom Dao Game Launcher + World Launcher), then we need to make it super easy to bring players, to have accounts, make payments, participate on game decisions, and so on. 

To be frank, we are talking about bringing millions and millions of active monthly users to the IC. ETH got its first congestion(s) with cryptokitties (a game!).

But this excitement and potential won't come out of thin air. We need every dev, marketeer, investor we can get. The task is real, but no easy feat, hope you too join us in this endeavor.

Thanks for your reading and consideration.

Eimolad | 2023-07-22 13:39:16 UTC | #17

I'm reading the White Paper right now and I'm having questions. Did I understand correctly that one of the goals of BOOM DAO is to create common developer tools? That would be cool. I will give an example from our practice. Developing browser games completely on-chain, we are forced to work in Unity Engine. Unlike UE, Unity does not have such a large set of tools. Some of the available tools cannot work with WebGL (for example, VFX constructor). In this regard, we are forced to write our own tools and libraries. It takes a lot of time and effort. Even shaders have to be created by themselves, because those available on the Internet are not able to compile correctly into IC. We will support the idea of creating a joint development environment, we think it is very useful

BOOM DAO IS A GREAT MOVE FOR THE ICP SYSTEM THEM BUILDING WITH US WILL HELP US MOVE FASTER TO GAMES ON THE ICP SYSTEM WE HAVE GREAT GAMES OF OUR OWN LIKE EIMOLAD AND DRAGGINZ  DSCVR-ONE GAMES MORE GAMES IN THE ICP SYSTEM THE BETTER  BOOM DAO WE NEED IN TO BUILD FORREAL WORK WITH THE OTHER GAMES IF FIND YOURSELF NOT ABLE TO MOVE AROUND THE ICP SYSTEM. AS FAR AS THE ICP YOU ARE ASKING FOR FROM NNS FUND IT IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT (I VOTE YES) ICP MEMBER WILL VOTE YES FOR BOOM DAO IN THE END[quote="atomikm, post:1, topic:21577, full:true"]

I'm curious about @borovan perspective on Boom DAO in the context of gaming and IC platform, given his extensive experience in developing mainstream game. 

Generally speaking, I'm in favor of the Boom DAO concept.

-------------------------

lixx | 2023-07-22 15:19:35 UTC | #20

Are you emphasizing the role of the project, rather than whether a 40% share is worth raising 600000 to 800000 icps. If that's the case, the role of just one project can be valued at 1.5-2 million icp, which is $6-8 million, without anyone using or understanding it. Why?

-------------------------

lixx | 2023-07-22 15:22:02 UTC | #21

Another question, do any members of your team work for the foundation? Or have members of the foundation participated in your development?

Gekctek | 2023-07-22 15:23:13 UTC | #22

Disclaimer: I am receiving an initial token allocation based off my work I have done with ICP.NET (C#/.NET agent) and collaboration with gaming teams in the ICP space. I was not involved in the whitepaper/SNS details but I am aligned with the BOOM DAO and expect to work with them in the future. The following is my thoughts and not pre-reviewed by the BOOM DAO. Ill have @atomikm or @icpmaximalist correct me if anything I say doesn't reflect their mission

Hello,
I wanted to also chime in to give my support for BOOM DAO and give my thoughts in general. 

I am excited about BOOM DAO. As a ICP developer this has the potential for creating a new organization to work for in the gaming space. Based on the whitepaper and my own interpretation, the DAO-ification of  BOOM DAO is vital for what it is trying to do which seems to be bringing together individual gaming organizations and developers to work toward a common goal of improving the IC gaming ecosystem and working together to build common infrastructure and shared tools that benefit all gaming organizations (and ultimately the gamer). Without a DAO like this its hard to organize, fund and collaborate between small organizations and individual developers. This is why consolidation in the modern day is common, because small businesses and individuals can be less efficient or redundant than a big corporation working towards a common goal. A DAO has the potential to be a powerful uniting tool. This DAO aligns with what I think  is  a powerful use case for where a DAO can really bring value. A DAO controlling an application is good, but a DAO aligning multiple parties (with their own apps) towards a common goal and sharing infrastructure.

I cant speak to any specific numbers or details of the SNS sale because I was not a part of the process, but I would say I agree with the general direction and goals of the whitepaper. 
- Create a DAO to allow game developer collaboration on common goals/needs
- DAO can contract with/award developers with tokens for work put towards those goals/needs
- Create a base protocol/service that creates a utility for the token besides just governance

Also this DAO token doesn't seem to be a just speculative asset like others can be. Not financial advice but I would personally not 'invest' in this DAO to 10000x your investment, but rather see it as an investment into making the IC gaming space a better place and well funded. The price of the token will probably be dependent on its actual utility vs a wildly fluctuating speculative asset. So if the DAO does a good job and creates something that is useful and something people want to use, that would affect the value of the token. But ultimately I think the real value of the DAO will come from gaming organizations being able to work together and not have to do redundant work in their own little bubbles, but rather do it once through the DAO, reducing costs and allowing small orgs to compete against larger orgs with more resources. All this in theory and has to be tested, but I am excited for the journey

In my personal utopian future fantasy
- Small organizations can thrive and have advantages that large companies by utilizing DAOs to collaborate on shared goals
- Incentives can be aligned between different orgs and individuals to work toward a goal that benefits the whole vs the just individual with negative externalities (through tokenomics)
- individual contributors (freelance devs, writers, etc...) dont need to be employed by a single organization, but instead work for multiple joint organizations (DAOs)
- Online services can be autonomous and provide a service and a fraction of the web2 rate because archaic human institutions dont have to be involved and rent seeking behavior can be more easily avoided due to the open nature of blockchain

As far as the SNS/Decentralization sale, this is a good way to get initial funding to allow the DAO to have community influence and be able to have initial funding for their goals. As far as the numbers I cant speak to because I am not involved in that and I am not a economist, so ill let others give their input on them. While there are technically other DAO options vs the SNS, the SNS is a Dfinity backed software project that seems to be the safest and most tested/stable option out there right now. So I support the SNS choice, but would say that as long as the BOOM DAO messaging is about making a good IC gaming ecosystem vs an investment that can 1000x I am on board with the funding from the sale.

Anyways, very excited for a DAO with good utility that focuses on a specific mission that isnt just an application. Also I wanted to send a thanks to @atomikm and @icpmaximalist for this opportunity to join them in this journey, just kinda fell into it as a freelance developer, but they seem to be leading the charge in this collaboration effort and uniting all these IC orgs and individuals to do something together.

How can we achieve a valuation of 6-8 million without a deliverable product? This valuation is clearly too high. It is obvious that they are considering using community funds to raise half of the amount, so their fundraising goal is not ecological users, but to ask for money from community funds.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-07-22 19:39:04 UTC | #24

If Tommy is behind this project, then I am all in. I thought this was a brand new project with brand new team.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-07-22 21:12:46 UTC | #25

By the logic on this thread anyone who’s been around the ecosystem building can SNS any project and no one is allowed to question their motives.

Fact is boom dao is a brand new project created specifically to raise money and community can see that and that is why there is a lot of negativity around this thread. 

I’ll be voting no on Boom Dao because I just don’t see the value.


If you’ve been in this ecosystem building for 2 years than SNS that project that you built. Sell that project to the nns.

No? Why ?


To me, this feels like you all think the SNS is up for grabs free money.

-------------------------

MrBennyP | 2023-07-22 20:53:04 UTC | #26

Very bullish on BoomDAO.  They will offer 40% of the total token supply to the community.  This is the largest amount ever allocated to the community in an SNS sale, and it will maximize BOOM’s decentralized governance.
I appreciate their mission to power the next generation of fully on-chain games, drive mainstream adoption of the Internet Computer blockchain, and provide a collaborative hub for all things web3 gaming.
This is a great project for the IC community.

claydoh | 2023-07-23 00:41:11 UTC | #28

A short synopsis of BOOM DAO that I hope can cover a couple of concerns I see commonly in the reply threads so far:

1.) BOOM DAO is a project created and ran by (unsure if I'm missing anyone) tommy.icp and Wenzel Barlett (ICP Maximalist). Both are longtime community members, and have been very active in both the gaming community via Plethora and through the SNS voting system. Regardless of when the twitter page was created, these are not new developers to the ICP ecosystem.

2.) The overall goal of BOOM DAO is to provide means for developers to work together and pool resources / ideas. Over the past couple years, projects like Eimolad, Cubetopia, Fae Folk, and Obsidian Tears have all been working separately to build on-chain games, and have often been running into similar problems along the way. BOOM DAO is infrastructure for developers and community members to work together and share knowledge / information to help grow the ecosystem of gaming on the IC.

-------------------------

alejandrade | 2023-07-23 01:08:00 UTC | #29

How will Boom dao be profitable to people who buy into it? Or to the neuron fund?

-------------------------

realdanmccoy | 2023-07-23 01:33:03 UTC | #30

Most of the stuff on that roadmap is fairly basic and the core team behind this has already received $300,000+ in grant funding. I don’t think this requires an SNS, nor should a recently formed group be immediately racing to the SNS.

Am I happy Tommy is producing tooling? Absolutely. He’s a hell of a unity developer. Do I think this is SNS worthy? No.

If anyone cares to discuss, especially the OGs, you all know exactly who I am and how to reach me. I hope everyone does their research.

I’m just now reading this thread for the first time and wanted to offer a quick clarification about this comment…@icpmaximalist and I are different people.  I’ve worked closely with him in the past and can vouch for his integrity and skill as a strong community leader.  It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to take credit for the success he’s had at building web3 communities and gaming projects.  I have long been active in the ICP Maximalist Network on Telegram, but have no role in Plethora or Boom DAO.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-07-23 02:04:49 UTC | #32

Hey @atomikm and @icpmaximalist and other partners and contributors for Boom DAO.  This is a very exciting SNS opportunity.  In my opinion, this kind of decentralized organization stepping up to become a strong contributor to gaming development on ICP is a perfect fit for SNS.  There are a lot of well respected OG people and projects identified as partners or contributors for Boom DAO, so it seems well positioned to become an essential and decentralized gaming resource for the ICP ecosystem.  You have my vote.  Keep up the great work.  I look forward to seeing how gaming continues to develop on the IC.

I think because the project has a treasury with a grant program and there is no product being shipped with the SNS, allocating 33% to team is inappropriate. 

Because of the 23% allocation to the treasury you are basically giving your self majority voting power over the treasury. in return the SNS is getting the promise that you will do a really good job with it. This is the opposite of decentralization and the opposite of what the SNS is supposed to be. 

At least with other projects the SNS has been getting an MVP product.

Lots of red flags here. I'm not saying you are bad actors. Just think this needs to be reworked.

-------------------------

realdanmccoy | 2023-07-23 03:55:48 UTC | #37

Most of the stuff on the roadmap includes unity template tooling, most of which should’ve been released with the $300,000+ in grants the core team has already received.

Building unity to WebGL and uploading it into an asset canister is not exactly that innovative. Useful? Sure. But it’s been done on the IC since 2021.

Pair this with the token allocations and you’ve got yourself some very strange justifications for considering this a good dao at this stage.

-------------------------

StofAxeCap | 2023-07-23 04:17:17 UTC | #38

**Why are you rushing this to the SNS?** 

It's a decent initiative, way to high of a valuation, especially when the team is taking 33% total. If this really is about the community, stop robbing them for your personal retirement fund.

Somehow we need to level up the gaming experience on the IC. This looks like a good way to do it. I know Dfinity has stated they are not competing with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The fact remains that what they built is superior and gaming is a great way to showcase it. It reaches the techies who are already on-chain AND the average idiots like myself who might not understand defi but can move arrow keys around and have a good time fighting monsters.

For transparency, I am a co-founder of the Obsidian Tears project. I came to the IC to build a great game after some of our old-time, favorite classics. Building in isolation with the new tech of the IC presented unique challenges. I turned outward for a long time looking for resources to build with. When we turned inward to the community instead, we found Tiago—fan of the game, and an experienced, capable developer. It was exactly what we needed to push the project forward at that time. Boom DAO is a chance to make sure gaming projects have our experience, but streamlined. Decentralized, community-involved, and pooled resources mean fewer bottlenecks, and the best at the wheel. A rising tide lifts all ships. Sure there are other avenues. And I can't speak for the token volume, I have no experience there. What I can speak for is my belief that aesthetics sell, and the IC needs some big names to start mentioning it in the world, or a rising draw to the idiots (like myself) to introduce them to blockchain. 

Gaming is a good draw to the non-technical crowd. There are several barriers to this (gaming targeted to the layman), but the IC is best suited to tackle it, and a gaming DAO is a great place to do the tackling. 

Imagine if a solution is presented that makes it easy for non-wallet/ICP holders to play a game. Then we can market to anyone. Then people have their feet wet and it's much easier to introduce blockchain concepts from there. What if all the games on the IC benefited from that solution simultaneously? We could market to anyone. Those are the types of thoughts I have on this...I feel the infrastructure to incentivize collaborative gaming on the IC can bring the influx of new users we hope will someday come.

Just to clarify,

The Founding Team does not have 33%.

Treasury doesn't count because it is not a Neuron, it's an Account, and therefore it can't vote. 

They have 10%, 5% for Tommy, 5% for Max. Compensated by the Treasury tokens not voting, since they are in a liquid form, that gives roughly 13.7%. 

They vest for 2 years, then start to be disbursed every month for the next 2 years, with a disolve delay of 6 months.

They put a big effort on being decentralized from the start.

Please see attachment as proof:

Because you mentioned 23% and not 27% (the real % of Treasury) maybe you meant that founding partners are the same as founding team, which is not. It will be independently controlled neurons. The full list of partners it's in the website.

Hope this information is helpful.

That core team has been given $300,000+ in grants to deliver relatively simple things, they don’t need 5% of a token sale on the SNS.

Do your research.

Most of the people who support boomdao are new users?

The founding partners and founding teams comprises 33% voting power:

The treasury does not vote so it gets no voting power.

That leaves community with 40%.

Means:


 12 to 14 people have 33% of the voting power and they only need to convince 8% of the voting power to have a majority. Which by seeing who the partners are could easily just be same partners who only need to buy up 8% of supply. 

That leaves 800,000 icp and essentially what sounds like the future of the gaming in the ecosystem in the hands of 14 people who would be handing over grants to their competition.

Assuming they do… because they could easily just hand over grants to selves.


Again I’m not saying they will and I’m not saying you all are bad people. But the way it’s set up we have to trust you and the point of crypto is to be trustless.

It’s clear why it’s set up this way I can head conversation in my head. “Well we can’t leave voting power to the plebs they won’t know what to do. It’s ok we can just hand over voting power to some of the game devs in ecosystem” so we fund it from the plebs but give them nothing in return.

Oh it’s ok we are giving them our sweet for profit games and nfts to buy.

This needs me be re thought out if you want to sell it to the SNS or it should be structured like a regular none profit and funded a different way.

Maybe they are GHOSTs 👻:smile:

They are (mostly) game developers, it's a proof that if it wasn't gaming on the IC, probably they wouldn't be interacting at all with the IC.

- Joey is the founder of Cubetopia,
- Eimolad is in the name,
- Ben is head of the recruiting agency of Code and State (Obsidian Tears has been trying to recruit a Unity Developer through them),
- David is the co-founder of Obsidian Tears.

Tomm is the only one I don't know personally, but he can present himself, if he wants too. 😅

Dear BOOM DAO Team,

I have concerns on your voting power distribution, The team (team & founding partners)holding 49.5% of voting. which make it completely centralized. Then why you say yourself as DAO, i would say its BOOM CAO. 
![image|690x277](upload://5q8XnjgQtzAOEpUZWYgFQknKvkq.png)


We can t expect barely 50% voting from CF & non CF so I would say team will have around 70% voting power at the end.

Valuations of MILLIONS without having a product yet nor a business plan, WHAT A JOKE. This has to end. For SNS to be successful it should act studying economics as a VC. Otherwise we will fail as an ecosystem.
In order to fulfill a submission we should create a standard that includes a video presentation and a deck about the project, team, 4-5 year roadmap and comprehensive economics to support the ROI projected.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-07-24 10:12:07 UTC | #53

Most VC's just guess anyway. There is no pattern to what will be successful. However, most rounds are just like 500k or less. So less is more in many cases. 4 - 5 years is way too long of a timeframe.  I think we just need to leave the larger round once the product has found product market fit. However, someone needs to invest into the infrastructure to support other projects. So it really depends what is being built. In this case it sounds like infrastructure work. I would like to hear from people building games on the platform and how they find it useful or if they will find it useful for their work. Every product is different, so yeah it is uncharted territory.

Is such heavy sarcasm an effective way of getting your valid opinions across? I like a healthy dose of sarcasm more than most but this is not hitting it's mark.

I have not yet formed a strong opinion to vote for or against this SNS and BOOMDAO appears to be attracting even more enthusiastic support and jaded scepticism than other launch proposals.
I think there is a lot more open and direct discussion to be done in this thread before I get to a yes or no.

But if this thread turns into yet another pro-difinity/anti-difinity manufactured partisan slugfest then I doubt it will serve it's intended purpose of helping undecided people (like me) from reaching an informed conclusion.

CapuzR | 2023-07-25 14:35:10 UTC | #57

Hey everyone :grinning:

I just want to share my experience with BOOM DAO tools.

At Elementum, we've been working in card games (Unity+IC) since a year and so.

Elementum' s Unity developer (Karupin) just wanted to focus on creating cool and decentralized games, he **didn't care about IC specifics** at the beginning and THAT'S OK!

**Imo, most developers will be like Karupin, and we should continue doing stuff thinking this way.**

[details="Pain points"]
HUGE build sizes, wrong cache management, weird react-unity-webgl behavior, terrible times for building and testing, Too much pieces in the puzzle, Managing NFTs/FTs, difficulty to get how to do everything 100% on-chain, little to none integrations between unity-ic and a lack of a lot of tools and basic stuff. Recently, BOOM DAO appears with a bunch of cool stuff and we're confident this will represent a lot of advantages for us, and a looot more for newcomers.
[/details]

So, regarding BOOM Tools **I've personally used**:
 1. Old Unity Template.
 2. BOOM Game Launcher with Brotli compression.
 3. NFT Deployment and distribution.

(  I'm pretty hyped to test IC-Net agent and Worlds asap jaja :star_struck: )

Now...
[details="1. Old Unity Template"]
Maybe for all the experts here the Old Unity template that BDAO released a year and so ago was a stupidly simple stuff but for people like us, a year and a half ago, it was THE THING that allows us to start more easily and enjoy a lot more what we've been doing :slight_smile: Thanks for that team :fire:

Basically, I think there are different types of developers and this kind of simple tools (Old Unity Template) are super necessary, even more than some complex one. Imo most developers just want to code and enjoy the type of coding they want in an specific timeframe, we (the intense-ones) can't pretend everyone should be like us.

Genius to invest time creating easy/simple tools that generate great value to a lot of devs, even if they don't to tech wizards that underestimate simple but value load stuff. 
[/details]


[details="2. BOOM Game Launcher (BGL) with Brotli compression"]
I live in Venezuela and in some locations internet really sucks (2-3 MB with a lot of instability) so I can say with confident that a card game with 100MB is not cool at all. **Bounty Rush had a 115 MB build and that was a HUGE pain not only for the team but also for players.**

Using BGL I now upload my game and result into a **25 MB build**  (Yeah, we have to improve the asset management and stuff jaja) both for Production and Staging env. I think I don't have to extend explaining how useful and awesome this tool is for us (Again, probably for other this is easy stuff, no idea jaja).
[/details]

[details="3. NFT Deployment and distribution"]
I only create a couple of collections to test and distribute to personal account just for fun testing but looks really useful and I'm planning to manage Elementum Season Passes rewards and a lot more other stuff via BGL.

Without this tool we would have to focus on stuff that separates me of what we're really building.
[/details]

**TL;DR** - This tools really Helped Elementum and I'm sure this is just the beginning, so pretty excited with this. Also, these will be the perfect tools to onboard A LOT of developers and abstract things that they're not interested about. So, let's boost this game developer eco :rocket:

**Aside note**: AFAIK, the project already have a lot of cool tools ready, including C# Agent, current Unity Template, NFT/FT deployment and distribution (connected with all the other tools), Game uploading to IC with brotli compression, interoperable worlds to connect games internally and connect with other games. So, I'm really surprise reading people telling the project doesn't have anything.

**Disclaimer**: I'm listed as a founding partner in the BOOM DAO website.

-------------------------

Tano.icp | 2023-07-24 15:54:01 UTC | #58

Hello everyone, I don't usually indulge in forum discussions, but it's strange how there has been so much negativity for BOOM DAO in this post, sensible people can just go for a healthy discussion.
It may be because people are just coming to a conclusion and not seeing what they have developed. I mean if you guys will go and check their tools and product, it's awesome. 
Game Launcher can help to onboard lots of Game Developers with no hindrance. 
World Engine is just next level thing, tech-oriented people can see how it can bring revolution, with a pre-built central Payment Service and interconnectivity of different worlds under one roof.

Maybe people just want to troll for no reason. But from what I can see The only use-case of Blockchain is in the field of Games and DEFI. And this can really boost gaming in IC Ecosystem, all we would have to do after this is good marketing and inviting game developers from outside of the Ecosystem.

-------------------------

Jabberwocky | 2023-07-24 19:31:43 UTC | #60

This sounds like a blatant money grab with bot scripted accounts shilling the project to make it seem legitimate. Why is this allowed? 
You guys already supposedly received $300k+ in funding and barely have anything to show it. Why does your project even need a DAO? It doesn’t make any sense and just sounds like a money grab. 
Also 99% of the games on icp that have been funded a ridiculous amount haven’t even been completed yet. Cubetopia is going down some pet nft quest route than focusing on the original game which was originally the only game project on the ic that seemed promising. 
But now the best project rn is Dragginz due to the team not requiring funding from the community.

You need to have a working/complete project before trying to get a dao.

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:03:52 UTC | #61

You started with three important words “gaming is hard”. We are glad you understand how hard it is, most people outside the gaming industry vastly underestimate how complex building a game is. Thank you for your understanding and support. BOOM DAO is a collective of builders with a solid expertise both with gaming and ICP, and focused on the three-fold mission described in our whitepaper: Showcase the Unique Capabilities of Internet Computer for Gaming, Build the Foundational Infrastructure for On-Chain Gaming on ICP, Foster Collaboration in the ICP Gaming Community. 

We are thrilled to have your support, and your trust in BOOM DAO means a lot to us. The World Engine product is indeed a pretty ambitious gaming infrastructure protocol and has a lot of potential to create a tsunami of network effects among the whole ICP ecosystem. Some very cool gaming projects including Cubetopia are already starting to use it. If you have any questions about the World Engine product or anything else related to BOOM DAO, we'd be more than happy to answer them.  We can even schedule a call if you want to.

@atomikm will be presenting the world engine at upcoming DFINITY Global R&D event on July 26th, this will be an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into the World Engine product and discuss our contributions to the IC ecosystem. Exciting times lie ahead, and we look forward to engaging with you further!

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:06:05 UTC | #62

Thank you for your positive and supportive feedback Tom! We are really excited about the game you’re currently building, we look forward to BOOM DAO helping you build ICPuppies Realms of Darkness, and providing you with any tools and/or technical support you need. We are thankful to be associated with positive builders like you with whom we share a collaborative and a positive-sum game mindset in everything we do.

We would like to make sure to clarify that BOOM DAO is a collective of builders with solid gaming and ICP expertise, focused on building the gaming vertical for ICP. It’s the synergies coming from all these projects/teams that will make this DAO truly powerful. It’s not a specific team or gaming projects behind it, although there are some core contributors of course. For example, @Gekctek building the incredible ICP.NET library has been a paramount contribution for on-chain gaming on ICP, @Joey_ICP founder of Cubetopia leveraging the World Engine for Cupetobia and rewritting some of the open-source tools in Rust is adding tons of value for ICP gaming ecosystem, same for @CapuzR founder of Bounty Rush and @tiago89 developing Obsidian Tears who helped a lot in providing feedback and improving the gaming tooling being developed. There are many more important builders and gaming projects being part of BOOM DAO, just naming a few to highlight that it’s really a collective force working hard to build the future of gaming on ICP.

As you perfectly mentioned gaming is indeed a powerful way to attract millions of people to the IC but there is so much to left to build at the gaming infra level for this to happen. It’s a massive endeavour but the good news is that we now have solid foundations and improving it every day. With the right incentives, we believe BOOM DAO will create an engaging gaming ecosystem that will showcase the full potential of building fully on-chain games on ICP. We're excited to have your backing as we move forward to make a significant impact on the ICP gaming ecosystem from which everyone will benefit.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:07:05 UTC | #63

We greatly appreciate your positive outlook and the support you've shown for the BOOM DAO project. It’s always been a pleasure providing support to ICKitties Paws Arena, and this will always be the case as part of the mission of BOOM DAO. We're the DAO for all ICP games, we want to see your game become successful and we are here to help you make it a success. Every experienced game developer and gaming project we’ve been in touch with understands how building gaming infrastructure is critical for the ICP ecosystem. The people who believe it’s easy either have no game dev experience, aren't actively building complex tech in the ICP ecosystem, or don’t understand how hard and necessary it is to build gaming infrastructure.

Your understanding of the challenges in developing games on the Internet Computer Protocol aligns perfectly with our mission. BOOM DAO aims to streamline this process by providing the necessary infrastructure and documentation, benefitting not just the gaming sector but the entire ecosystem. It’s already happening, as mentioned in previous messages with more and more gaming developers and gaming projects using BOOM DAO gaming infrastructure. We believe that uniting game developers under a DAO will amplify our collective impact and prepare the ICP ecosystem for the promising future of Web3 gaming.

We dive deeper into all these aspects in our whitepaper, unfortunately the most vocal people attacking BOOM DAO clearly show through their interactions they haven’t read the whitepaper. By the way, we are always happy and open to schedule a call with any intellectually honest person wanting to know more about BOOM DAO if they have a genuine interest for ICP ecosystem’s best interests, and really want to see ICP gaming ecosystem succeed. Together, let's shape a vibrant gaming ecosystem on the Internet Computer!

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:18:34 UTC | #64

Thanks a lot @tiago89 for providing your perspective and congratulations on your amazing trajectory as a builder. It’s refreshing to hear from someone who has actually been developing games in ICP ecosystem and knows what he’s talking about. You are in the perfect position as a game developer to fully understand the challenges currently faced in the ICP gaming ecosystem and how BOOM DAO is already solving lots of them, as you’ve benefited from the open-source tools that BOOM DAO has developed. You know first-hand that the infrastructure BOOM DAO has built is far from simple or easy, as assumed by people who have zero experience in building games.

[quote="tiago89, post:15, topic:21577"]
We (now talking about me, Obsidian, Plethora, Cubetopia, Eimolad, etc.) believe we need to solve this as a group, not as individuals. There are large benefits to all by having shared infrastructure, sharing interactions, shared token, etc.
[/quote]

You nailed it perfectly, BOOM DAO is a collective of builders focused on the ICP gaming vertical and that’s what makes it powerful to address the big challenges faced by ICP gaming ecosystem. A collaborative mindset and working together is a must. That’s why adhominem attacks on specific individuals or specific teams is missing the whole point of creating a collaborative ICP gaming ecosystem where all ICP stakeholders will benefit. 

[quote="tiago89, post:15, topic:21577"]
We need to invest on infrastructure, make it easy for any game developer to publish on the IC (see Boom Dao Game Launcher + World Launcher), then we need to make it super easy to bring players, to have accounts, make payments, participate on game decisions, and so on.
[/quote]

Thats the exact plan as described in the whitepaper and it’s already happening. The Game Launcher product and World Engine product are all about helping game developers build easier and quicker. They both required many months of work behind the scenes. In reality, the whole R&D process to get to this point took two years since genesis.

Your message really captured what is at stake for the ICP gaming vertical, BOOM DAO, and the whole ICP gaming ecosystem. Let’s remain focused and keep building!

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:17:32 UTC | #65

Thank you @Joey_ICP for your very insightful post. For more context for people reading the forum, Joey is the founder of Cubetopia, an amazing leading game in the ICP ecosystem that won the first prize at the Supernova Hackathon back in June 2022. As you mentioned, BOOM DAO is a collective of talented builders having deep expertise in both gaming and ICP. We couldn’t be in better hands to build the ICP gaming vertical and make ICP the best blockchain for gaming. BOOM DAO has nothing to do with Plethora, its team is just a core contributor kickstarting the DAO and the ICP gaming infra but in reality BOOM DAO is an entirely different collective of builders. We understand we need to do a better job at explaining this to the broader community, especially to people who draw quick conclusions without doing due diligence research or reading the whitepaper.

Thanks for mentioning that BOOM DAO has already produced a multitude of tools that are kickstarting a new wave of game developers and projects on ICP. It's true that both your team and our team wish these tools already existed when we started building on-chain games on ICP. And we've heard the same sentiment countless times from all the other gaming devs on ICP. Experienced game devs on ICP know the deep tech complexity of building on-chain gaming infrastructure, and how critical it is for the Internet Computer's ecosystem growth.

[quote="Joey_ICP, post:16, topic:21577"]
I will personally be doing what I can to help BoomDAO transform the IC into THE chain for gaming. In my view ICP has the potential to become the ultimate blockchain for gaming, and this is something far from being in the public zeitgeist. Have a quick google for “best blockchain for gaming” do you see ICP mentioned anywhere? I hope BoomDAO will open the floodgates, both helping to onboard game developers and to provide a space where we can point gamers too to showcase all the awesome games we have building on the IC.
[/quote]

We couldn’t agree more, and that’s why we share the same mission and vision for BOOM DAO to champion ICP to become the blockchain for gaming. We will open the floodgates to game builders, and we're laser focused on the developer experience, not on the critiques coming from people with zero experience in gaming.

[quote="Joey_ICP, post:16, topic:21577"]
BoomDAO’s idea for The World Engine is also a much welcomed addition the ecosystem. My time building on the IC has been at times frustrating as I have tried to navigate the different standards we have. I hope that The World Engine will offer new developers an intuitive way to store their game data on chain, and will open the door to an interoperable future on the IC where games can easily communicate and share data with one another.
[/quote]

I think it’s also the perfect timing to start telling the broader community that Cubetopia (and other games) are working on leveraging the World Engine, which will start creating a wave of network effects across the ICP gaming ecosystem. It’s really a massive advancement for what’s possible in terms of gaming moving forward. We are super excited to be entering this new gaming paradigm with you and Cubetopia by leveraging the BOOM DAO World Engine protocol.

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-07-24 20:22:05 UTC | #66

Hey Eimolad team! Yes you understood it perfectly. BOOM DAO has a three-fold mission as explained in our whitepaper: Showcase the Unique Capabilities of Internet Computer for Gaming, Build the Foundational Infrastructure for On-Chain Gaming on ICP, Foster Collaboration in the ICP Gaming Community. You're right, creating common developer tools to streamline the gaming development experience is at the core of what BOOM DAO does. All the challenges you mentioned are currently being worked on by BOOM DAO to be solved. Happy to hop on another call whenever you want to coordinate and address more of your challenges. 

You accurately described the fact that by having all gaming projects and developers building their own tools/solutions separately, we're all wasting a lot of resources (time, money, people). What if instead, a group of experienced builders with both a deep expertise in ICP and in Gaming could build what most gaming projects/devs need? 
This is what BOOM DAO is currently doing, and this is why we refer to it as the DAO for all ICP games. It’s a collaborative and massive endeavour to build the ICP gaming vertical, and everyone in the broader ICP ecosystem will benefit from it. We know gaming is a major blockchain use case, now we need to make ICP the premiere blockchain for gaming.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:22:44 UTC | #67

Thanks for sharing your perspective about BOOM DAO.

[quote="claydoh, post:28, topic:21577"]
1.) BOOM DAO is a project created and ran by (unsure if I’m missing anyone) tommy.icp and Wenzel Barlett (ICP Maximalist). Both are longtime community members, and have been very active in both the gaming community via Plethora and through the SNS voting system. Regardless of when the twitter page was created, these are not new developers to the ICP ecosystem.
[/quote]

@wpb already provided a clarification. Wenzel and I have known each other since right after genesis and we have collaborated together through different community-building initiatives. I had the chance to witness Wenzel becoming a leader and expert in ICP governance and leading healthy debates on this topic, resulting in many important achievements for the ICP community such as registering the first NNS community public neurons. Wenzel has always been really active as a leader in the ICP Maximalist Network (ICPMN) telegram group and former ICPMN neuron (now Synpase), maybe the confusion comes from that. I will never take credit for these highly important achievements for ICP community, and will always be thankful to have participated in it with Wenzel.

[quote="claydoh, post:28, topic:21577"]
2.) The overall goal of BOOM DAO is to provide means for developers to work together and pool resources / ideas. Over the past couple years, projects like Eimolad, Cubetopia, Fae Folk, and Obsidian Tears have all been working separately to build on-chain games, and have often been running into similar problems along the way. BOOM DAO is infrastructure for developers and community members to work together and share knowledge / information to help grow the ecosystem of gaming on the IC.
[/quote]

This is perfectly summarized, this is exactly what BOOM DAO is all about. By building games separately we are missing lots of synergies to grow the ICP gaming ecosystem. By building gaming infrastructure together under BOOM DAO we will greatly accelerate the ecosystem growth. Thanks for sharing your perspective.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:26:15 UTC | #68

Hey Wenzel, thanks for sharing your perspective on BOOM DAO. As always, it’s valuable to hear your insights. We are glad we managed to successfully convey the mission and the potential of BOOM DAO to you. Thanks for the support Wenzel and for the intellectual honesty that defines you.

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-07-24 20:39:54 UTC | #70

Thank you @Gekctek for sharing your insights. You perfectly captured the main purpose of the DAO which is to build the ICP gaming vertical with a powerful group of builders comprised of diverse ICP and gaming expertise. You’re one of them and we would like to take this opportunity to shine a light on the structure of BOOM DAO. As explained in previous messages, BOOM DAO is composed of different individuals, teams, games, developers. This is where its biggest strength comes from and how it will grow the entire ICP ecosystem by advancing the gaming vertical. 

We've previously mentioned how Cubetopia is leveraging the World Engine and contributing code to it. Now we would like to publicly acknowledge that the [ICP.NET](https://github.com/BoomDAO/ICP.NET) library you’ve built is critical gaming infrastructure for the ICP gaming ecosystem. Ultimately, all games on ICP will utilize it, and it has already positively impacted many games on ICP.

Open-source tools being developed by BOOM DAO have already been in the work for months and years, and are being used by more and more game developers on ICP. It's a testament of how BOOM DAO is bigger than any single team or individual, and how it already streamlines the process of building games on ICP through solid gaming infrastructure. Tools like [ICP.NET](https://github.com/BoomDAO/ICP.NET) show clear traction among the ICP game dev community. BOOM DAO and the ICP gaming vertical is super thankful to have you solving a major problem for ICP gaming infra that has stunted every ICP gaming project.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 20:39:15 UTC | #71

Thanks so much for your support and excitement Ben. We can’t wait to have our call with you and discuss your crazy idea! Yes as you said 40% is the biggest token allocation for a community in an SNS sale. And to clarify the false narrative being pushed, founding partners are also community members, and they will vote however they want, they don’t have any constraints. Nothing has been negotiated with partners to influence them to do otherwise, they can confirm. This is not how we build long-term valuable relationships/partnerships at BOOM DAO and it will never be the case. 

Some people with a zero-sum mindset will see founding partners as enemies because of their allocation. When you see it with a positive-sum mindset, you understand these are the core people who are pioneering gaming on ICP, and delivering on the mission of the DAO. They are doing good for the community and fully part of it. This is why we also insist on a strong community-centric voting power as stated in our whitepaper, in reality the community will have a massive 85% of voting power, and anyone can vote for what they believe is the most valuable in BOOM DAO’s mission. 

Thanks for your support and we are really curious to hear more about your crazy idea for BOOM DAO!

-------------------------

atomikm | 2023-07-24 20:49:29 UTC | #72

Hi Sormarler!  

Thanks for the kind support :slight_smile: After building games on ICP for the last 2 years, I firmly believe BOOM DAO is one of the only ways the ICP gaming vertical will flourish. Also I wanted to clarify that neither I, nor any single individual is behind this project. It’s a collective of builders who are collaborating on a massive endeavour to build the gaming vertical for ICP. I'm a core contributor like other individuals, but BOOM DAO is its own entity not affiliated with a single person/project. It must be its own distinct entity so it can properly align all the gaming projects on ICP behind one shared goal. We need to better communicate this structure of BOOM DAO. The brand is new but the builders composing it have been building for years in the ICP ecosystem, and the gaming infrastructure is the result of years of R&D. BOOM DAO already has a wide range of gaming tools being used across the ICP gaming ecosystem. The goal is that even a 14 year old can build a fully on-chain game on ICP in a matter of days! We appreciate your kind support.

Thank you for expressing your concerns and sharing your perspective in a respectful manner. I'd like to address the misconception regarding the voting power of the founding team and founding partners. It's important to clarify that these neurons are not owned by a single entity, just as the neurons from the SNS sale won't be owned by a single entity. Our partners, like any other community member, have the freedom to vote according to their own judgment and preferences. They are valuable contributors to the DAO, and their active involvement should be seen as a positive aspect for the entire community.

 Associating the partners' voting power with malicious intent and framing it as a detriment to BOOM DAO misses the core essence of our collective efforts. We are a united group of builders who are actively working to create value for BOOM DAO, all its stakeholders, and, consequently, the entire ICP gaming ecosystem. It's essential to note that at genesis, the founding team will only hold 15% of the voting power, as clearly explained in the whitepaper. BOOM DAO's SNS is designed to be community-centric, with 40% of tokens allocated to SNS participants (biggest allocation to date) and 85% of the voting power owned by the community (SNS participants + Partners). I invite you to refer to the "community-centric voting power" section in the whitepaper for more details on this matter.
 
Thank you for engaging in this discussion, and we value your input as we work together to build a thriving gaming ecosystem on the Internet Computer.

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 21:17:19 UTC | #76

Thank you for expressing your concerns and demonstrating your genuine interest in the success of the SNS and the ICP ecosystem. 

However, it appears that you may not have thoroughly researched or read the whitepaper. A simple investigation into BOOM DAO's GitHub and technical documentation would reveal the various gaming tools and products we have been diligently building to streamline the gaming development process on the ICP blockchain. Additionally, a quick review of the whitepaper sections would have provided insight into BOOM DAO's growth strategy and path to sustainability.

We appreciate your feedback regarding the inclusion of a video presentation and deck. It's an interesting suggestion, and we thank you for sharing it with us. As a matter of fact, BOOM DAO will be presented by @atomikm during the upcoming DFINITY Global R&D event on Wednesday, July 26th. If you happen to be a gaming developer, we would be more than happy to schedule a call with you, offering guidance and technical support to assist you in building your game.

Once again, thank you for your engagement, and we are open to further discussions to address any inquiries or concerns you may have.

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 21:21:19 UTC | #77

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on BOOM DAO. One of your messages has already been flagged by the community, so let's strive to maintain a civil and positive environment to foster the growth of the ICP ecosystem. There have been no escalations, as all gaming builders who have used BOOM DAO are satisfied with it and recognize its potential for the ICP ecosystem. Our primary focus is on game developers and gaming projects, as they play a vital role in driving the ICP gaming ecosystem forward. We would be more than happy to answer any questions you may have and schedule a call to discuss matters further if you are interested.

Now, addressing some specific points you raised:

1) Regarding the marketing support process, it is open to any project in the ecosystem to be mentioned by DFINITY's Twitter account. Our goal was simply to spread awareness about BOOM DAO within the ICP community. Every project can go through this process, and we have not received any special treatment in this regard.

2) We are curious to know if you are a game developer or if you have experience building complex projects in the ICP ecosystem. Understanding your background in this field will help us engage in more meaningful discussions. As for the Unity Template, it would be beneficial to know if you have used it to develop a game. By experience, anyone saying building anything related to gaming is simple/easy (like you said for the Unity Template) have no experience at all in this field, they are just talking about something they don’t know.

3) This doesn’t really make any sense, not sure what you’re trying to say. It mainly sounds like an adhominem attack.

4) This seems off topic as well.

5) This again is in no way constructive.

6) This is the way it should be, just vote based on what you think is best for ICP ecosystem.

Remaining civil and adopting a collaborative mindset are essential values for us. We genuinely wish to engage with you further and extend our invitation to schedule a call if you are a game developer or involved in any gaming project. Our mission is to support and contribute to your success.

Thank you, and we look forward to any opportunity for productive dialogue.

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-24 21:25:19 UTC | #78

Hello @icarus
 
We want to express our sincere appreciation for understanding the importance of maintaining a civil and positive environment that encourages high-quality interactions and positive outcomes. It's truly refreshing to encounter someone who takes the time to form opinions thoughtfully, especially in a world where forming quick judgments has become the norm.
 
Indeed, we have noticed that BOOM DAO has evoked strong emotions from various individuals. However, it's crucial to emphasize that our core focus is on gaming developers and projects. Their feedback on BOOM DAO and its mission has been overwhelmingly positive thus far. As experienced gaming developers, they appreciate the complexities involved in the gaming industry and fully understand the value of our efforts. Those with no gaming experience would be the ones to claim that constructing gaming infrastructure for the most powerful blockchain in the world is a straightforward task. 

We wholeheartedly agree that there is ample room for open and constructive discussions. It's intriguing to observe that individuals who tend to polarize the community into pro-DFINITY/anti-DFINITY factions are often those who struggle to accept differing opinions or the growth of other projects within the ecosystem. To form a well-informed opinion, we encourage you to connect with game developers who have utilized BOOM DAO’s tools and actively contributed to BOOM DAO's vision of building a thriving ICP gaming ecosystem. These individuals are diligently working behind the scenes 24/7, driven by the long-term interests of the ICP community, rather than seeking attention through baseless noise.

 We would be more than happy to arrange a call with you, not to convince you of anything, but simply to answer any questions you may have. We value open and transparent communication and believe that constructive dialogue ultimately leads to better understanding and progress.

 Thank you once again for your thoughtful approach, and we look forward to any opportunity to engage further with you.

I apologize! I thought that wpb and ICP maximalist were the same person. Thank you for the clarification-

This is an interesting one. I agree that the community should establish certain barriers to prevent scams or un-serious projects from getting through, but an ecosystem struggling to grow and desperately in need of value-generating services and infrastructure can't really afford to be TOO strict.

There are systems in the SNS that can be used to programmatically prevent the devs from rug pulling the community and running off with the money (e.g. vesting periods). If there's a sufficient vesting period (say, a few years) then there won't be any liquidity left for the devs to run off with if they don't make any progress in that time.

If the developers are willing to accept longer vesting periods and other anti-rug pull measures, tailored to how transparent and trustworthy they are, then I don't see a problem with accepting them as an SNS.

Let’s be clear here the objections to boom dao have nothing to do with dfinity.

Most objections I see are specifically pointed at the founders.

My objection centers around the centralization of power for an entire vertical.

You are giving almost majority voting power to partner and founders.

If we are pretending like ICP is going to be the number one blockchain and it’s going to replace the internet and we usually are. Then decisions we make this early into the ecosystem are crucial. Allocating this much ICP this early and handing it to 14 people for them to control the direction of one of the biggest verticals is insane.

I don’t think adopting this proposal or launching this SNS will allow the group to control the direction of the gaming vertical. There are other teams outside of this group that are also building games. Also, if any big players from that industry do decide to join the ecosystem I don’t expect them to bend the knee.

-------------------------

Eimolad | 2023-07-25 12:16:22 UTC | #84

In this case, it is necessary to make a reward system for developers of game modules. But it is also necessary to take care of the economic benefits for those who encourage developers.

Thank you for participating in this forum thread with a more appropriate tone in your recent messages. Maintaining civility in this forum and the ICP community at large is crucial for the success of our ecosystem. We all bear the responsibility to cultivate a positive and respectful environment where individuals can express their opinions and engage in learning and growth.  

I noticed some misconceptions in your previous posts regarding BOOM DAO, and I would be glad to help clarify your questions now that you are engaging in a more constructive manner. Saying that BOOM DAO has not shipped any products shows a lack of basic research. A brief review of our whitepaper's table of contents would direct you to our comprehensive technical architecture and wide array of gaming tools. Our website further showcases various open-source tools, the link to our GitHub, and the technical documentation on Gitbook. These tools have been diligently developed over months and are already actively used within the ICP gaming ecosystem. Should you be a game developer, we welcome the opportunity to schedule a call to delve deeper into this matter.

  In another message you said BOOM DAO was specifically created to grab people’s money. This could easily sound like an adhominem attack, however we believe this comes again mainly from a lack of research. We fully agree with you that we need to better communicate the structure of BOOM DAO. The brand is new but most builders composing it have been building singe genesis in the ICP ecosystem, and the gaming infrastructure is the result of years of R&D. BOOM DAO already has a wide range of gaming tools being used across the ICP gaming ecosystem as explained above.

  A very interesting question you asked was how BOOM DAO will become profitable. A simple look at our whitepaper would have provided you information on our gorwth strategy and path to sustainability.   

Let's now address one of your major concerns regarding voting power, which has already been addressed multiple times in this thread. We genuinely understand your concerns, but it is essential to recognize that partners have your best interests at heart and are fully part of the community. If you were to develop a game tomorrow, they would be there to provide support and contribute to your success. This aspect holds significant importance for us to comprehend. We are all collectively building with the best interests of the ICP ecosystem in mind, particularly concerning the ICP gaming vertical. It is essential to clarify some significant misconceptions, not just for BOOM DAO but for the entire ICP ecosystem, especially when it comes to suspicions. Builders should not be viewed as adversaries to the community; on the contrary, they play a crucial role within the blockchain ecosystem and are fully integrated into the community. Their continuous efforts in building 24/7 significantly impact the success of the ecosystem's growth. Having a strong group of builders for BOOM DAO, possessing extensive expertise in both ICP and gaming, and sharing a unified mission, is genuinely exciting and should be celebrated. It enhances the prospects of building a thriving gaming ecosystem on ICP with greater certainty.  

Partners/contributors are fully integrated into the community, and that's precisely why we refer to a community-centric voting power in BOOM DAO's whitepaper. In reality, the community will hold 85% of the voting power. Partners/contributors have the freedom to vote according to their own beliefs, just like SNS sale participants. They do not represent any single entity and are entitled to express their opinions while acting in the best interests of the ICP gaming ecosystem. We fail to see any valid and articulated reasoning that would suggest their actions are against the community's interests. Especially when the token allocation for SNS sale participants is the biggest seen so far with 40%.  It is crucial to understand that builders are integral members of the community, with the only distinguishing factor being their active contributions and continuous efforts to build the gaming vertical on ICP. This dedication is widely recognized, and all other community members should appreciate their valuable contributions.  

Moreover, there is a misconception about BOOM DAO possibly seeking to control the gaming vertical on ICP. This notion couldn't be further from the truth and overlooks the dynamics of business and innovation. BOOM DAO has explicitly shared its three-fold mission, which revolves around showcasing the unique capabilities of the Internet Computer for gaming, establishing the foundational infrastructure for on-chain gaming on ICP, and fostering collaboration within the ICP gaming community. These objectives reflect our dedication to nurturing the growth and success of the ICP gaming ecosystem. Simply put, if you are building a game on ICP, BOOM DAO’s mission is to make your game a resounding success.  

We are actively building since genesis and pushing the ICP gaming vertical forward. It’s time now to take gaming on ICP much more seriously to make it the blockchain for gaming. We reiterate our invite to schedule a call with us if you want to.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-25 19:26:00 UTC | #88

Thank you for sharing your perspective and engaging in this discussion in a civilized manner. We sincerely appreciate hearing your thoughts on the matter. Your reasoning makes perfect sense, and we wholeheartedly agree that it is crucial for all members of the ICP community to be mindful of the ecosystem's best interests in any SNS projects they undertake. Upholding high-quality standards throughout the entire ICP ecosystem is of paramount importance.
 
However, it is essential to strike a balance and avoid extreme viewpoints that may lead to baseless assumptions about the intentions of diligent builders who tirelessly contribute to driving the ecosystem forward. It is important to note that the core contributors of BOOM DAO consist of well-established community members, many of whom have been actively building since the genesis of ICP. Their contributions have brought immense value to game developers and various gaming projects within the ICP ecosystem, underscoring their genuine commitment to creating a vibrant gaming landscape on ICP.
 
Any narrative that portrays such dedicated individuals as bad actors should be carefully scrutinized based on factual evidence. While maintaining high standards and ensuring community safety are crucial, it is equally important for us to acknowledge and respect the hard work of builders who have a proven track record of success, evidenced by a wide range of products being actively utilized across the gaming vertical.

 Let us continue to collectively uphold the highest standards within the ICP community while acknowledging and celebrating the achievements of dedicated builders who play a pivotal role in propelling the ecosystem towards success. Together, we can foster a thriving and respectful community that remains focused on the betterment of the ICP ecosystem as a whole.

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-25 18:23:45 UTC | #89

Thank you for highlighting the significance of fostering constructive discussions and showing respect when engaging with others. 

You raise a valid point, it appears that some of the most vocal individuals have not conducted thorough research into the developments achieved by BOOM DAO thus far, as well as its substantial contributions in assisting numerous game developers on the ICP platform.
 
We are pleased to observe your comprehension of the immense potential held by the World Engine protocol in uniting a vast amount of games and generating innovative gaming applications, made possible exclusively through ICP blockchain technology. The game launcher serves as a product primarily designed for game developers, streamlining their development experience and empowering them to commence game creation on the ICP platform within a matter of days, rather than months.

 BOOM DAO is the DAO for all ICP games, and our unwavering vision revolves around creating the most vibrant gaming ecosystem ever established. This vision will continue to serve as our guiding principle as we endeavor to shape the future of gaming on ICP. Our commitment to this endeavor remains steadfast, and we will persist until it becomes a reality.

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-25 18:25:05 UTC | #90

Thank you Ricardo for sharing your thorough perspective as a game developer utilizing the tools developed by BOOM DAO. We completely resonate with your thoughts on the importance of making game development on the Internet Computer much more accessible. Our core contributors share the same belief that it should not be overly complicated for developers to tap into the unique capabilities offered by the Internet Computer. Our mission at BOOM DAO is precisely geared towards onboarding a significant influx of game developers to ICP by streamlining the gaming development experience and making it remarkably user-friendly. We often use the metaphor that even a kid should be able to create fully on-chain games on ICP without any prior blockchain knowledge.
 
Your valuable insights into the pain points faced by game developers on ICP due to the lack of gaming infrastructure are immensely appreciated. Only a game developer who has experienced these challenges firsthand can truly understand their significance. Sharing your experiences provides priceless feedback for all newcomers venturing into game development on ICP. We wholeheartedly agree that game developers should not have to worry about solving these pain points when utilizing BOOM DAO's gaming tools. Instead, they can focus their energies on building exceptional gaming experiences.

 Moving forward, BOOM DAO will remain steadfast in our commitment to building foundational web3 gaming infrastructure on ICP, propelling the next generation of fully on-chain games. Our primary goal is to ensure a seamless developer experience and make game development on ICP as effortless as possible. Once again, thank you for your comprehensive review of how you have benefited from the various tools developed by BOOM DAO. 

There are even more exciting tools awaiting your exploration, and we eagerly anticipate hearing more of your feedback and supporting your journey to building successful games!

[/quote]

Let me start with stating the reason people get emotional is because of this condescending tone. I just want to point that out.

That said,

What I mean by no product has been shipped is there is no dapp connected to the SNS therefore you are not selling anything to the token holders. This to me seems to mean that you are asking for funding for a non profit.

So there is profit to be made, how does world engine protocol implement the boom token? 

My last question,

What is your goal in this forum? Is it to sway votes? All I’ve seen is team members and project owners act like the community is not allowed to be critical of a project that is being funded of our own dime. 

We are all icp investors every project that takes from neuron fund is an investment by every icp investor. You all need to be more patient and more open to criticism even if that criticism is incorrect because you are asking us for money. 

Maybe instead of releasing a white paper on notion there should have been an outline here in the forum post

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-25 20:28:31 UTC | #94

[quote="alejandrade, post:93, topic:21577"]

[/quote]

Ascertaining the full impact of the World Engine protocol at this juncture is premature, as it is currently in the adoption phase, aiming to establish network effects among numerous ICP games. More and more ICP games are already working on integrating it. This phase is anticipated to yield unforeseen gaming use cases. Subsequently, a second phase will focus on monetization, with a projected timeframe of approximately two years to generate revenues for the DAO via the World Engine.

Thank you for offering clarification. Indeed, it appears that the communication regarding this matter might not have been sufficiently explicit. It is essential to note that both the Game Launcher and the World Engine canisters will be subject to the governance and control of the SNS.

We have diligently adhered to the established procedure for initiating an SNS, which involves creating a post on this forum and actively participating in community interactions. We wholeheartedly encourage open discourse and value diverse perspectives, regardless of individual opinions or voting preferences. Our overarching aim is to foster an atmosphere of mutual respect throughout the entire forum, ensuring it remains a constructive environment where everyone can engage, learn, and progress in a courteous manner. Embracing this mindset serves the best interests of all individuals involved and contributes to the long-term prosperity of the entire ICP ecosystem.

Thank you so much for the thread and thorough replies.

1. You mentioned that anyone can join BoomDAO without owning a token or NFT. Can you please elaborate on that more? How do you account for active contributors who cannot participate in governance due to not owning a token?

2. Can you please post more information on the two founders? I am not sure if everyone is familiar with the founders behind the projects.

3. Do you have any code around your SNS?

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-07-27 01:09:31 UTC | #100

Good question @jennifertran I would also like to know if there is a central place on github where the code is located. I would like to take a look. Thanks.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-07-27 01:57:21 UTC | #101

I saw a link to their GitHub repositories on the [Boom DAO website](www.boomdao.xyz).  Here is the link to the repositories...

https://github.com/orgs/BoomDAO/repositories

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-07-27 03:00:23 UTC | #102

Code quality isn't very good. Is there going to be a good amount invested into making it better. I would love to see testing and refactoring done. I am talking about Motoko code.

-------------------------

icpmaximalist | 2023-07-27 08:59:36 UTC | #103

Thank you for engaging in this thread and asking your questions. We are happy to answer them.

1. We acknowledge that our previous communication may have caused some confusion. Moving forward, we will strive to improve our messaging and clarify this aspect more effectively. What we actually mean is that game developers and gaming projects will have access to leverage BOOM DAO's tools and products, irrespective of whether they hold BOOM tokens or not. Additionally, anyone can become a contributor and contribute code to BOOM DAO without the need to hold any BOOM tokens. For instance, if the DAO votes on a proposal to open a bounty for code contributions, any developer can participate in it. We are strong advocates of voluntary participation in governance, which we believe nurtures a more dynamic and inclusive environment. Our objective is to cultivate a flourishing ecosystem where incentives are harmoniously aligned with engaged participants in the DAO. This includes developers, projects, gamers, investors, and all other stakeholders, empowering them to actively partake in governance and contribute to its success. 

2. The founding team consists of @atomikm and @icpmaximalist. Since the genesis of the ICP ecosystem, we have been actively building games and gaming infrastructure and have been deeply involved in various community-building initiatives. Our diverse range of contributions has been publicly and widely available within the ICP ecosystem since the summer of 2021. However, it's crucial to emphasize that BOOM DAO is not centered around any individual or entity. Rather, it is a collaborative effort driven by experienced builders who possess profound expertise in both ICP and gaming. Our united goal is to propel the ICP gaming vertical to new heights and bring forth the most vibrant gaming ecosystem ever created, right on the Internet Computer. 

3. @wpb has kindly shared the link to BOOM DAO's GitHub repository. It's important to note that BOOM DAO's different GitHub repositories are publicly displayed on our website, and everything is open-source. In a separate post on this thread, we will share the canisters architecture that will fall under the SNS control and governance.

Thank you for providing your feedback, it is genuinely appreciated. Unfortunately, the general statement you shared appears to be somewhat vague, making it challenging for us to take specific actions based on it. If there are any specific aspects you'd like to highlight or address, we invite you to provide more detailed information.
 
We are aware that certain areas require improvement, and we are already working on them. For example, we are actively refactoring the game launcher and addressing bugs in the World Engine. Should you be interested in delving deeper and collaborating with our team, we warmly welcome you to reach out to us privately. This could mark the beginning of an exciting journey as a valued contributor to BOOM DAO. 

  It's important to bear in mind that the codebase undergoes constant updates and enhancements to ensure ongoing improvement.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2023-07-27 09:42:40 UTC | #107

I mean unit testing and then canister testing would be a good place to start. Also seems like many of the types can be separated into there own files and reused. There is no error handling for the most part. Assert is used widely. There is nested callback hell with switch statements that can be made cleaner. I mean I would love to make contributions but I am busy and only have time to contribute to the forum and making quick overviews of code. I really don't have time to dig in since one cannot live from open source contributions. I just want to make it known that it is probably a good idea to refactor and test really well before any more changes are made. In the commit history I don't see any refactor notes. This isn't an attack on the project. I just care about product quality at every level, even code. It always amazes me that when an author writes a book they pay many editors to review their writing, but engineers don't do the same. I mean I understand when you don't have money, but I am assuming this will take place after you get funding.

I feel like we aren't allowed to express our honest review without sounding like we are somehow attacking the project. I support the project because we need code infra to support game devs. However, I also value quality vs quantity.

This DAO is also a very new way to contribute to open source code. Who gets to decide how the money is distributed for contributions. Very strange territory for sure. I an intrigued how it will evolve. We have seen some instance with grants/dev bounties but not really within project based DAO's. I don't think OC has any paid outside contributors. Kinic just did a design competition. Dragginz is self funded. So don't know how it looks like when outside devs want to propose to make paid changes and how the DAO handles that.

Hi Cyberowl!

Thank you for your detailed response, this gives us a lot more insight into your code feedback. I also believe we're entering a new paradigm with BOOM DAO, nothing has been done like this before. We're carefully anticipating the most optimal way to coordinate many developers building on-chain gaming infrastructure together through a framework such as the SNS. We love to hear feedback and we're always striving to maintain the highest standards in software engineering and Motoko coding practices. I would recommend reaching out to any of the core contributors, you can also reach out to me personally on Discord with the same handle I have here. We are constantly getting amazing feedback from the many game devs leveraging our products, we take this feedback seriously and are always implementing improvements and fixes to our codebase. 

Regarding your specific feedback, I completely agree that features such as unit testing and canister testing are key parts of running enterprise-level products. Although unfortunately Motoko still lacks a lot of key tooling around these areas. For example, Tiago from Obsidian Tears who is a core contributor of BOOM DAO, has been diligently building the first unit testing library for Motoko. A lot of the tooling and processes that we've come to expect in more mature tech stacks simply hasn't been built yet on ICP. Other examples would be CI/CD systems for canisters and WebGL games, and an Internet Computer Testnet to run Staging builds. We are eager for these tools to be fully production-ready so we can incorporate them into the codebase of BOOM DAO and improve our engineering processes.

Regarding error handling and assert statements, this is great feedback and I've personally given this feedback to our engineering team. Our team has a startup mindset, we're always moving quickly to build products and test immediately that they provide value to people, rather than prematurely optimizing code that could be useless or removed in the future. "Move fast and break things" is the famous motto of Facebook that kept them focused on shipping valuable products rather than getting lost in the code optimization rabbithole. There's a fine balance that BOOM DAO must achieve where we are providing top-notch developer experiences with amazing error handling and logging, while also maintaining our fast development cadence to ship new valuable features and improvements to the people who are using our products. I also believe the SNS unlocks really cool opportunities for contributors to help review, improve, and architect code to ensure both speed and quality in our code development.

Lastly, regarding your feedback about callback hell, this also relates to the way the Motoko language was designed. Believe me, I hate seeing nested switch statements as much as any other engineer. When we designed BOOM DAO's products, we made the intentional decision to take advantage of the unique features that the Motoko language invented. Features such as variant types and optional fields. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the language, we crafted an extremely flexible and modular code base that can easily be extended with new variant types and adapts to many use cases by leveraging optional fields. But the unfortunate side-effect is that variant types and optional fields must be read and null checked using switch statements. This leads to the code base being filled with switch statements. We'd love to collaborate with the Motoko team at DFINITY to improve this language design, and we're always open to feedback if you have come across a workaround. Please reach out to me in Discord, I always love to chat about this stuff.

Also thank you for the feedback that it's not clear in the commit history that many refactors have been done. In reality, the current codebase has undergone 7 major refactors over the course of the last 3 months after receiving valuable feedback from game devs leveraging our products to build their games. We will make our commit notes much more detailed moving forward so this is clear.

We're extremely excited to see that many devs are interested in contributing to BOOM DAO's infrastructure and protocol, this is a great sign that our products are providing value. Thank you for showing interest in potentially becoming a paid contributor. The process for becoming a contributor will be more clear after our SNS launch with the formation of the BOOM Game Makers Alliance. This collective of game dev contributors will ascertain what features/products provide the most value to all ICP game devs. Then they will make proposals to the SNS and create bounties for individual contributors to contribute code to BOOM DAO and receive compensation.

I hope this provided a thorough answer to your questions. If you happen to be a gaming developer, we would be more than happy to schedule a call with you to hear more feedback on the codebase and to assist you in building your game.

Do you have a timeline on when the team will test dapp operations and the SNS launch?

Awesome Atom, thank you for the amazing work you and the team have done so far. I look forward to seeing how the project evolves and how games make use of the tooling.

I have studied the Tokenomics of the project. I saw useful information that is commonly called metrics. I also saw the principles of token distribution and the reward system. But I didn't see the economic model of tokens. Those are the tools that will make the token useful and make the price rise. I suggest discussing possible options together with the community and creating a really interesting economic model of the token.
1.	1. First of all, we need to think about the core of the BOOM DAO product. Because it is the product that is the subject of the utility of the token. If the core of the product are game modules and libraries, then the developers of these should be rewarded with $BOOM tokens. 

2.	2. Secondly, we need to set up a system for selecting and evaluating game modules and libraries so that attackers do not spam with unnecessary offers in order to get $BOOM. 

3.	Also, we need to understand who exactly will reward developers for modules: the $BOOM Fund or potential consumers (other developers).

4.	4. We should create additional motivations for the entire community to retain and buy $BOOM. That is, each holder of $BOOM should have some benefits and preferences in all BOOM DAO projects.

This system should be simple and understandable for every user. $BOOM should cover the maximum segment of the market and be not only useful, but also profitable.

Very interesting points brought up in this conversation, also some less interesting ones. I think a lot of the early expressed misconceptions have already been tackled. 

As a Founding Partner and on behalf of UnfoldVR project I wrote up a tweet thread discussing the Boom DAO initiative. For a gaming DAO I feel that other channels than this forum are targeting the potential end users better.

Any feedback on my points are welcomed, both here and on Twitter...or *X*.

Thank you, Eimolad team, for thoroughly considering the future of BOOM DAO, especially regarding the development of a tokenomic model that accrues over time. At BOOM DAO, we strongly believe in the power of blockchain incentives to effectively coordinate game developers and gaming projects within the community.

1. We completely agree that game developers contributing to BOOM DAO should be duly rewarded through the SNS treasury, and this is exactly what we have planned. The implementation of this reward system will begin with the establishment of the BOOM Game Makers Alliance after the SNS sale. This collective of game development contributors will carefully assess and prioritize features and products that deliver the most value to all ICP games, shaping the early stages of the tokenomic model as you mentioned.

2. Rest assured that we take all consequences into consideration when making decisions, including second and third-order effects. While we share your concerns about the potential misuse of the developer reward system, we are mindful of not overthinking problems that may not exist yet. To maintain the quality and motivation of contributing developers, a selection process, yet to be finalized, will ensure that only eligible and dedicated developers can contribute and get rewarded. At BOOM DAO, prioritizing the onboarding of high-quality developers who are aligned with our mission is of utmost importance, and this commitment will persist in the long term.

3. In the initial stages of the DAO, developers will receive rewards through the SNS treasury. Looking ahead, developers and projects utilizing BOOM DAO's gaming infrastructure (as outlined in the whitepaper's path to sustainability) will indirectly support the developers contributing to the DAO, as their payments will flow into the SNS treasury.

4. From a legal standpoint, the matter of returns on investment in buying BOOM tokens is complex, which is why all SNS whitepapers include a disclaimer section. It is essential to understand that BOOM tokens should be regarded as utility tokens, not investment vehicles. We do not provide financial advice or promise any profits. We encourage everyone to carefully read the BOOM DAO disclaimer section. Our primary mission is to build value within the ICP gaming vertical and ecosystem holistically. As BOOM DAO continues to build essential infrastructure, numerous opportunities will emerge to increase the utility of BOOM tokens exponentially. We approach this process methodically, with the first phase focusing on becoming the core infrastructure for all ICP games through BOOM DAO, generating a wave of network effects across the ICP gaming landscape.
