* Implement `Storable` for accounts.
* `UnboundedStableBTreeMap` as an account storage medium.
* Save accounts in the `pre_upgrade` hook only when accounts are stored in the heap.
* Save account stats in the `pre_upgrade` hook rather than recomputing them in the `post_upgrade` hook.
* Migration functions.
* Render pending and failed BTC withdrawal transaction as such.
* Add `ENABLE_SNS_TYPES_FILTER` feature flag.

* Use `ic_cdk::println` instead of the `dfn_core` equivalent.
