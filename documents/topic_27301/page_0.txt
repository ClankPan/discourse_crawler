Did something change in the Internet Identity Sign In Process? For some time now I'm noticing that after reading my face or fingerprint, the screen returns to "Choose your Internet Identity" screen and stays there for maybe 3-4 second without any change, before closing and returning to the dApp. This should be improved, the screen should maybe be blurred, display a "spinner", or similar to let users know the login is in progress. Thank you.
