## Project highlights

Starter template leveraging chain fusion technology to build EVM coprocessors on the Internet Computer Protocol for Azle Developers.

## Problem

Starting a project sometimes it's difficult, especially when we are trying to use a new technology.

There are use cases that have not yet been explored as much when using Chain Fusion, such as using ICP as a Co-Processor for EVMs.

## Solution

Provide an easy way for developers to start building products that merge the advantages of Ethereum and ICP.

## Code

Github URL: https://github.com/adrian-d-hidalgo/azle-chain-fusion-starter

You can fork or clone this project to start working with your own development.

Please feel free to report bugs or contribute.

## Future plans

- Maintain up-to-date all dependencies.
- Fix reported bugs
- Improve code structure
- Improve documentation
- Switch from Express to NestJS (maybe)
- Solve all pending TODOs
- Enable an easy way to develop with Sepolia

This looks great! FYI to @lastmjs. Maybe this can be part of the Azle book?
