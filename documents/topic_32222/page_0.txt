# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/e3fca54d11e19dc7134e374d9f472c5929f755f9/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c e3fca54d11e19dc7134e374d9f472c5929f755f9
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

I can see that now the commits listed in the proposal's summary are the Merge Requests, which include more details and context on the changes made in that commit.

I think this helps people to better understand the changes made and brings more transparency to the proposals.

More details in [this comment](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/31933/11) and its thread.

Good job, @DRE-Team!

This is awesome.  Thank you @DRE-Team and @sat!  I believe most of the CodeGov team prefers to see these Merge Requests linked in the proposal summary.

Thanks for this release DFINITY. I gather that enabling deterministic time slicing on system subnets has been motivated by the NNS subnet incident last week. Are @DRE-Team able to share which system subnets DFINITY plan to deploy this replica version to first (if only there was a canary system subnet on mainnet)? Can I ask why DTS was previously disabled for system subnets (is it due to memory overhead)?

On a separate note, I found [this commit](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/a28e7115e) interesting (and lacking an accessible explanation). It reduces firewall_max_connections test coverage, such that it no longer covers system subnets. Are you able to share more info about the motivations behind this commit?

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **130727**
Vote: **ADOPT**
[Full report on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/99)

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @ilbert, and @Lorimer.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @tiago89.  I recommend folks take a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here or in the thread of each respective proposal in our community on OpenChat if you have any questions or suggestions about these reviews.

Hi @Lorimer, the commit does not change any coverage for the test. We noticed that we created both a system subnet and an application subnet for the `firewall_max_connections ` system test, but we only tested the connection limit for the application subnet.

This means that the system subnet was redundant for the test, creating extra overhead in setting up and running the test.

-------------------------

Lorimer | 2024-07-03 07:18:01 UTC | #10

Thanks for clarifying @dsharifi - I see what you're saying. It looks like it's [been that way since the limit was introduced](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/bea056fdd96e950fe42328bd665308e81848fcae#diff-b71f86b6838738dff4e130a20025ef006d88408b30a4f0b4a6b99fe1d34b2b42R81)). I'm still a little curious - the test setup had the intention of testing both application and system subnets (because they behave differently?). Why not modify [connection_count_test](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/bea056fdd96e950fe42328bd665308e81848fcae#diff-b71f86b6838738dff4e130a20025ef006d88408b30a4f0b4a6b99fe1d34b2b42R75) to loop over the two subnets types, instead of removing the system subnet altogether? I'm only asking to get a better handle on things (not because I think anything is wrong) :)

-------------------------

dsharifi | 2024-07-17 14:45:07 UTC | #11

The reason we don't loop over both subnet types is that the firewall rule that we are testing, defined [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/dfinity/ic/-/blob/ic-os/components/ic/ic.json5.template?L249) is the same for both Application and System subnets.
