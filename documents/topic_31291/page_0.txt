Zero Knowledge Proof is one of the latest development in the cryptography world. It enables a new paradigm in which computation of user data can take place at client side, not server side. And you can send out ZK proofs, instead of raw user data, to prove attributes of an entity. We believe this pattern gives strong protection of privacy—your data is most secure when you are the only one holding them.

Now that we have started building ZK related infrastructures in ICP, e.g. a verification layer for all sorts of ZK proofs, we’d love to collect real world use cases which require privacy-preserving computations. It would be great if people can post their needs/ideas here and we can discuss how their issues may be solved with ZK.
