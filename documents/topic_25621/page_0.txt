Unfortunately, I always had an anchor there and I just logged in using the trezor one via passkey. Now, almost a year later, I wanted to log in to NNS, but it asks me for the identity number that I lost, is there any way to log in if I donâ€™t know the identity number but the key is created using passkey?

I have no idea when i create anchor. 2-3 years before.

I create a new anchor with same trezor, is a problem?

If you've exported the seed, the first string is your anchor number.

p.s. You can also send email to support@dfinity.org for additional help.
