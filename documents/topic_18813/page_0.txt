There should be a dashboard with live stats for OpenChat that is easily accessible from the app. 

1. It should show the contents of the treasury with a clear value of all the various tokens it’s holds in US dollars 

2. It should show all the user stats as far as DAUs, MAUs, etc. the app is now a public utility and so it’s active performance should be public too
