Have you try also `sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"` ?

The doc has been moved from sdk.dfinity to smartcontracts.org, maybe some urls aren't valid anymore ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Try updating open-ssl on your machine.

Thank you for the tip. I tried that, but didnt work. The error now i am getting is a bit different, but still it is a cert issue. I installed newer curl which comes with openssl 1.1.1.
