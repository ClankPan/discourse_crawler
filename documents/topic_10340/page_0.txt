There is something special with this new release that we never did before and that we want to point out.
The canister sandboxing that is mentioned in the release notes is actually not enabled yet. 
To test it carefully we will propose [another replica version](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/84dfddf05fb28bd2d53853cff16efcce5c17a850) to be elected that has [this new feature enabled](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/84dfddf05fb28bd2d53853cff16efcce5c17a850). This version will only be rolled out to the [k44fs app subnet](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnet/k44fs-gm4pv-afozh-rs7zw-cg32n-u7xov-xqyx3-2pw5q-eucnu-cosd4-uqe). If you run a canister in that subnet and are observing any anomalies please reach out to us. You can check in which subnet your deployment is running by pasting your canister id into the search bar of the public IC dashboard. 

If you want to learn more about the new canister sandboxing feature we would recommend you a [community conversation about that topic](https://dfinity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_gv6jxFjuTsarHblscHLPQA&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1642955605196572&usg=AOvVaw3TFJEUA2EZLQ8Uv1s6Jpr9) next week Tuesday 19:00 UTC.
