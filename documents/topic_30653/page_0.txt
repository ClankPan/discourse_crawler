Is it possible to build a file-transfer service on ICP similar to Wetransfer or Dropbox?

How does the Gigabytes shared between two parties get metered and sold?

Interesting idea and worth exploring further. Given the obvious advantages ICP has over the legacy systems, this can take off very well.

 A Swiss bank has made something called Docutrack. It is basically a dropbox alternative hosted on ICP. Check it out, maybe the code is open source ( I doubt ) but it at least shows itâ€™s possible

So Docutrack allows ICP ID users to share between each other files of any size, free of charge ?
