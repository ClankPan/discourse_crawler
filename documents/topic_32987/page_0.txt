Hello, I'm new here.
And I have questions about oauth.

I'm building a simple dapp and implementing a login feature.
I want to create an oauth feature, but is there any way to integrate methods such as email or apple login that are used in web2?

I posted a question on Discord, but was told it was not possible. However, I'm wondering if there is a way.

I've tested making it through NFID, but I'm wondering if other oauth is completely impossible.

Hi @JungHo-K1m 

If you simply want to sign-in, then this is possible. Unfortunately, we do not have a nice reference implementation to follow. I outlined in [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-generate-delegated-identity-on-server-and-send-to-browser/25334/8?u=frederikrothenberger) what would need to be implemented.

Also, take a look at this example, that uses Auth0 as an identity provider: https://github.com/ilbertt/ic-react-native-jwt-auth

I hope this helps. :-)

Is it okay to proceed in the following way?

1. sign up via NFID 
2. save the principal received from ICP
3. Proceed with oauth login
4. save the provider_id provided by oauth 

=> Store these data on-chain(backend canister maybe).
