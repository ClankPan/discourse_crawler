Hey, @bob11 , I'm trying to implement the usage of the StoicIdentity client, but I'm running into a problem with the `idlFactory` variable that is passed into the `Actor.createActor` function. https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/stoic-identity#readme:~:text=const%20actor%20%3D%20Actor.createActor

 the error that the browser console is throwing is :
 `App.jsx:80 Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`

In the example you all provide, I don't see any definition for the `idlFactory`. I've attempted to import all `idlFactory`'s that are included in the declarations files and all of them throw errors. Where can i import the `idlFactory` variable or find the definition for it?

Hey! DM me on Twitter and I can help you. Probably a better place to discuss than here in the forum. @BobBodily on Twitter. Thanks!
