For those that follow [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org), whether or not you do so on a frequently basis or from time-to-time don't forget to subscribe to the email newsletter (top right)!! 

The team produces a monthly "in review" newsletter which provides a summary of technical progress, events and press behind the project. I find it a huge time saver instead of having to scour for the latest developments/news.

For example, In the most recent newsletter, it was mentioned that Dfinity was picked up on the blockchain section of [*WIRED25: Stories of People Who Are Racing to Save Us*](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-stories-people-racing-to-save-us/)
