I just cloned the the repo for the internet identity canister and UI. can anyone help me resolve this issue? I am using Mac M1 os. I'm trying to run the repo locally, using the instructions from [here](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/tree/main/demos/using-dev-build)
but when I run the following command: 
```
dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'
```

I'm getting this error message in the console: 
```
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed to build call canisters.
    Failed while trying to build all canisters.
      The post-build step failed for canister 'rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai' (internet_identity) with an embedded error: No such file or directory (os error 2)```

on another note, I consistently run into problems when upgrading to the most recent repo fo the internet identity and trying to run it locally. Each time i pull the latest version of the internet identity repo, i encounter some sort of build fail thats specific to Mac M1 OS. The solution to the issue often requires multiple days of searching through the forum and through github for solutions to the issue and that often stalls development for a few days. I think it'd be really helpful if the `README.md` file included a separate set of instructions for users operation on Mac M1 OS. @diegop could you see to it that the right person is CC'd on this?

You want to debug or develop II locally or you want to deploy II locally to develop your own app?

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 10:04:52 UTC | #5

@peterparker , i want to deploy II canister locally. And I’m getting the above error message when i attempt to do so.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 12:35:36 UTC | #6

I gonna assume you want to deploy II to work on your dapp - i.e. not to implement something within II.

As I actually answered this question few times (here on the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-setup-locally/15767/2?u=peterparker), discord or twitter), I thought that I was maybe actually worth a blog post. So, here you go.

https://6zvwc-sqaaa-aaaal-aalma-cai.raw.ic0.app/d/deploy-internet-identity-locally

Let me know if it works out for you?

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 13:12:08 UTC | #7

@peterparker  I attempted option 2. I made sure that `dfx start` was running and I ran the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity
cd internet-identity/demos/using-dev-build
npm ci
dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'
```

and the console is still giving me the following error:
```
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed to build call canisters.
    Failed while trying to build all canisters.

Work out for me 🤷‍♂️.

Maybe you local dfx state is dirty? `dfx start --clean` maybe?

i gave it a shot, and still no success. are you using Mac M1?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 13:36:43 UTC | #10

I got a M2.

Super weird. Have you try the first method? Same result?

P.S.: Just updated the article to simplify the 1. solution

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 13:43:10 UTC | #11

@peterparker  haven't tried the first method just yet. I just upgraded to the latest dfx version and gave it another attempt. now I'm getting this error message: 

```
Error: Failed to fetch root key.
Caused by: Failed to fetch root key.
  Encountered an error while trying to query the replica.
    An error happened during communication with the replica: error sending request for url (http://127.0.0.1:4943/api/v2/status): error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61)
```
This error looks a bit more familiar.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 13:43:58 UTC | #12

Ah I had that one too few minutes ago when I was double checking that the method worked out!

`dfx start --clean` and cloning II in a fresh repo solved it for me.

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 13:48:48 UTC | #13

And its working! thanks a bunch :pray:t5:

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 13:50:10 UTC | #14

Awesome! Happy to hear that 😃

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 14:04:14 UTC | #15

so, Its deploying, but for some reason, instead of the Internet identity UI, I'm seeing this: 
![Screen Shot 2022-11-27 at 8.02.33 AM|690x429](upload://6Uwbc4R8hZceWRmdGx7KtXj8Wal.jpeg)

and when i click "Authenticate" its redirecting me to the II thats on mainnet.

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 14:26:03 UTC | #16

It's probably because you collected the wrong canister ID for the local Internet Identity.

It's that one I think

Jesse | 2022-11-27 16:36:04 UTC | #17

@peterparker  I ended up having to change the URL for the local version of the II interface. It was still pointing to localhost:8000, but the last version of the II is deployed to localhost:4943. So I've gotten my project deployed locally along with the II. and now I'm getting an error message in the browser console. 

I suspect this error is due to the fact that my II canister and my project aren't running on the same port. My project is running on localhost:8000 while the II canister is running on localhost:4943.

Is there a solution to this that doesn't involve me having to run both canisters on the same port?

if not, how do i go about changing the port that II canister runs on?

peterparker | 2022-11-27 18:13:23 UTC | #18

Ummm I never run on that issue. Maybe the 2. solution does not fit well your setup. Can you give a try to the 1. one?

i.e. deploy II locally through dfx with following config

```
"internet_identity": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity_dev.wasm",
      "shrink": false,
      "remote": {
        "candid": "internet_identity.did",
          "id": {
            "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
          }
        }
      }
	},
```

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 17:25:58 UTC | #19

I gave option 1 a try and it deploys fine, but this option doesn't provide the II user interface that I need. I only get the backend canister. is there somewhere I could find the dfx configs for the UI of the II canister too?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 17:46:51 UTC | #20

[quote="Jesse, post:19, topic:16876"]
the II user interface
[/quote]

Ummm that's weird, in my projects using such method I get the II user interface - i.e. I can then use II to sign in locally with my dapps. As both methods works in my dapps and sample repo, not sure what's the issue here.

Your project is open source?

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 18:03:40 UTC | #21

I just changed the visibility so that you can see it. You can find it here at this link: https://github.com/JessAYrn/Digital-Time-Capsule/

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 18:06:38 UTC | #22

Cloned it you can change the visibility again

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 18:11:10 UTC | #23

Which version of dfx are you using?

Above dfx solution works for >= 0.12.0

For dfx < 0.12.0 the solution is the following

```
    "internet_identity": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "internet_identity.did",
      "wasm": "internet_identity.wasm",
      "build": "bash -c 'test -f internet_identity.wasm || curl -sSL https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/latest/download/internet_identity_dev.wasm -o internet_identity.wasm; test -f internet_identity.did || curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/internet-identity/main/src/internet_identity/internet_identity.did -o internet_identity.did'",
      "remote": {
        "candid": "internet_identity.did",
          "id": {
            "ic": "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
          }
        }
      }
	},
```

-------------------------

Jesse | 2022-11-27 18:18:41 UTC | #24

I'm currently using 0.12.1

-------------------------

peterparker | 2022-11-27 18:22:51 UTC | #25

It doesn't work I think because you have an hardcoded local canister ID for II in your `webpack.config.js`

```
new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin({
      NODE_ENV: 'development',
      DTC_CANISTER_ID: canisters["dtc"],
      II_URL : isDevelopment ?
      "http://localhost:8000?canisterId=rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai#authorize" :
      "https://identity.ic0.app/#authorize",
    }),
```

Update `http://localhost:8000?canisterId=rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai#authorize` with the effective canister ID or `process.env.INTERNET_IDENTITY_CANISTER_ID` should do the trick.

You were right! i got everything up and running with no error messages in neither the CLI console nor the browser console. Thanks for the help :pray:t5: :pray:t5: :pray:t5:

Super cool, my pleasure! Have fun hacking 👍

Just FYI: this is the frontend of a cycles wallet. If you go to `$(dfx identity get-wallet --network ic).ic0.app` you should see the same interface

Thank you @Severin for providing more context
