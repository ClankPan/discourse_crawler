This thread is a follow up to the thread [Reset Followees for the “All Topics but Governance”](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reset-followees-for-the-all-topics-except-governance-category/11922). It is an updated proposal based on the feedback from the community.

## 1. Objective

Decentralized governance cannot be fully achieved without very high participation rates from the voting body. We currently observe 45% of total voting power is cast on Governance proposals, but we have near 100% participation in All Topics Except Governance. The root cause of this discrepancy is that many neuron owners have not configured their neurons with a Followee for the Governance topic, yet they are receiving voting rewards because of default following that was configured for all neurons on the All Topics “catch all” category. This discrepancy in participation rates is an incentive to submit spam proposals for the purpose of receiving higher voting rewards at the expense of others receiving lower voting rewards. This proposal aims to remove this incentive by establishing a minimum standard for active participation in governance that will strongly motivate all neuron owners to actively configure Followees and periodically confirm their selections.

### Proposal:
Require neuron owners to confirm their neuron Followee selections every 6 months. The recommended solution is to create a new button and countdown timer prominently displayed at the top of the Neurons tab in the NNS dApp (as well as a manage neuron command) that enables users to easily see how long they have to confirm their Followee selections and to easily perform the confirmation. The confirmation process should include a second confirmation pop up indicating what is being confirmed and why it is important to confirm Followees. It is acceptable for this confirmation to apply for all hotkey controlled neurons that are associated with the principal ID that is performing the confirmation (this avoids multiple confirmations for owners with a lot of neurons). When this confirmation button is first presented in the NNS dApp, all neuron owners should be allowed 1 month to confirm their neuron selections for the first time. All confirmations afterward shall occur at an interval of no longer than 6 months. When the confirmation button is clicked, the countdown timer is reset back to 6 months and begins counting down again. If a neuron holder modifies a followee for their neuron, the countdown timer is reset back to 6 months and begins counting down again. In the event that a neuron owner does not confirm Followee selections before the countdown timer expires, then all Followee designations shall be automatically removed from the neuron configuration.

## 2. Background

The driver for this proposal at this time is that it will remove incentives for spam proposals that are submitted to the NNS for the purpose of increased voting rewards. This will be explained below, but first it should be clarified that this change is much more important because it incentivizes further improvement toward decentralization. This feature will ensure that all governance participants make intentional decisions about their Followee selections on a regular basis, which should be the bare minimum requirement for active governance participation. ICP is a governance token and the tokenomics are designed to incentivize participation. Staking is not intended to be just a source of yield farming. We should expect that anyone who stakes must remain sufficiently active to know how to participate in governance and are doing so by this minimum standard of active participation.

This action also ensures that none of the public known neurons in the NNS dApp will retain followers indefinitely. It causes all active governance participants to stop to think about their Followee selections. Also, if neuron owners stop confirming their selections for any reason (e.g. they pass away or they lose interest in ICP governance), then their voting power will no longer be permanently assigned to a public known neuron. This helps ensure that public known neurons are always working to attract and retain followers.

All neurons were configured by default to follow ICA (neuron 28) for All Topics when the neuron was created. In many cases, this was not a conscious choice by the neuron owner. It has resulted in many neurons that are not casting votes on Governance motion proposals. This was a huge problem when only 6% of total voting power was casting votes on governance proposals. Now that proposal weights have been implemented, participation is up to 45% of total voting power. This is a significant advance in the decentralization effort and is a direct result of ICP tokenomics being tweaked to incentivize governance participation. These tweaks worked by enabling neurons that are voting on governance proposals to receive higher rewards while neurons that are not voting on governance proposals are receiving lower voting rewards. Yet, the incentives are insufficient. A whopping 55% of total voting power is not voting on governance proposals and the most likely way to get them to start participating is to double down on the previous tokenomics tweak by removing default following for All Topics if the neuron owner does not actively confirm their Followee selections. Neurons cannot receive voting rewards unless they vote and at this stage of ICP and NNS evolution there is no good reason why we should accept that voting rewards are being allocated purely based on default neuron configurations. We can and should expect a minimum standard of active participation by periodically and intentionally choosing to confirm Followee selections.

## 3. Pros

Reduces the probability that someone will produce spam proposals for personal gain.

Increases decentralization by increasing the total percentage of votes that are cast on governance proposals.

Establishes a minimum standard for active participation in governance in the form of easy, periodic confirmation of Followee selections; ensures ICP tokenomics is rewarding active participants.

## 4. Cons

This proposal would take time for Dfinity to place on their roadmap and implement, but it does provide time to communicate the change effectively to the IC community.

Over half of the voting power in the NNS is not currently voting on governance proposals, which implies there are likely a lot of neuron owners who will stop receiving voting rewards if they do not confirm their Followee selection. There could be a lot of people who get upset with this change.

The community response to this concern can be provided in simple terms: 1) staking entitles neuron owners to vote, 2) voting entitles neuron owners to voting rewards, 3) voting can occur manually or by liquid democracy through Followee designation, 4) all neuron owners are personally responsible for making sure their neuron is voting if they want voting rewards. These principles have not changed and will not be changed with this proposal. Basically, all neuron owners are encouraged and empowered to remain active participants and configure their neurons so they can earn maximum voting rewards.

## 5. Alternatives Considered

This proposal is not a complete solution to the proposal spam problem. It removes the incentive that is based on economic gain, but there are other causes of spam including advertisement and announcements. However, this proposal removes the root cause of one of the strongest incentives for spam proposals while also advancing the decentralization effort. If this proposal is implemented, then it will likely increase overall voting participation on Governance proposal topics.

## 6. Key milestones

A [previous version](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reset-followees-for-the-all-topics-except-governance-category/11922) of this proposal has been in deliberation for the last week. This revision has been scoped based on actionable feedback that we received during that deliberation. This new proposal will be deliberated until at least April 18 and will then be submitted to the NNS as a governance motion proposal [in coordination with other proposals that will be made in a similar time period](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-call-for-proposals-to-resolve-non-actionable-proposals/12049).

## 7. Discussion leads

Wenzel Bartlett (@wpb) and Kyle Langham (@Kyle_Langham) will lead this discussion and submit the proposal to the NNS.

## 8. Security concerns

No security concerns have been identified at this time.

## 9. What we are asking the community

* Review comments, ask questions, provide actionable feedback
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

Why do you keep trying to take away voting rewards from people who are following other neurons? This is nuts. Every 6 months?!! Following other neurons is a great thing, most people don’t have the time or brain space to keep up with the nns or the proposals, and letting their neurons follow another trusted neuron is their contribution to the votes.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-13 01:07:09 UTC | #3

That seems like a mischaracterization of this proposal.  We don’t want people to miss voting rewards.  We want people to participate in governance topics and ICP tokenomics is clearly designed to incentivize participation.  This proposal also does not discourage people from following other neurons.  It proposes to give people a very easy way to confirm their Followee selections as a minimum standard for active participation.  In our opinion, set and forget should not be an acceptable norm for a governance token.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-13 03:42:14 UTC | #4

I fully agree with more active participation in the voting.  I was my understanding that ICP should not be seen as a Staking rewards system but a governance token where you get paid because you perform some work.  By the way, the vast majority of governance proposals are very easy to understand and it takes 5 minutes per day to vote on them all manually.  10 minutes if you do every 3 days.
But it was sold to many investors that ICP stake for 8 years was a great passive income.  So I do not blame investors, who got in with the passive promise and now face a change, not to be so happy.
@wpb can you comment, explain, on this tweet of last August?
![Screenshot_20220413_101422|690x294](upload://zdT9bSk8stRpQjGPzjP4uK5TUnZ.jpeg)

skilesare | 2022-04-13 04:02:02 UTC | #5

I'd prefer to encourage active participation and management rather than force it.  Maybe if this was every four years and we had a big people party and it happened during ICCon or something like that, but every six months does seem a bit too often.  Something on the order of the HALVING on BTC might be a better time period.

-------------------------

doo | 2022-04-13 04:21:31 UTC | #6

Using money to drive people to do things they don't like is no different than submitting crap proposals... It would help pledgers a lot if they added tutorials and reminders corresponding to each step in the neuron configuration Followee, 6 months of updates is too costly for users to forget.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-13 09:51:33 UTC | #8

Yes, I can explain it.  It’s my staking strategy for ICP back in August 2021 made in reference to my staking strategy back in May 2021 made in response to some post where someone else was asking I don’t know what because you chose to link an image instead of the full reference.  Nonetheless, my staking strategy still hasn’t changed today in April 2022.  I don’t vote manually on every proposal.  I suspect you don’t either.  Otherwise you would be logging in to the NNS dApp every 10 minutes to vote for exchange rate proposals.

@coteclaude what point are you trying to make about the merits of this proposal?  How do you think this proposal differs from what you interpret from that tweet?  I don’t think that tweet is inconsistent with this proposal.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-13 10:20:31 UTC | #9

I suggested something similar a couple months ago, happy someone formalized it. In my opinion renewing followees isn't just about aiding with the spam proposal issue but NNS governance as a whole, IRL we have election every couple years to confirm our support to a party, the same should happen on the NNS too, it incentivates people to keep up with governance and prevents neurons from keeping voting power they don't deserve anymore (i.e deceased neuron holders, lost neurons etc..), the only issue I can see with the system is scripts to autoconfirm followees might be developed.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-13 10:21:51 UTC | #10

If you don't have time to press a button twice a year then you don't deserve rewards and shouldn't be staking in the NNS in my opinion.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-04-13 10:41:44 UTC | #11

I fully agree with your proposal.  Like you, I see ICP as a governance token and receiving rewards because you are involved with the network governance. In fact, if it was me, all governance voting should be done manually.  
To answer your questions:  I did not copy the link as I fell on a retweet from Kyle, pure coincidence, and use the fastest way to get the info.  No malicious intent at all here.
Also, for your suspicion on how I vote, I vote manually on all governance proposals every day.  Of course, voting on the exchange is useless and I don't even understand why there are votes for these.  Same with all high technical upgrade where I am not qualified to vote on.
I did not said the tweet is interfering with the proposal.  What I am saying is that those tweets, from many people, have lead people to see the NNS as an easy rewards staking tool where you stake for 8 years and sleep on it.  Now, I would understand some investors not to be happy about the changes where they have to do something.  It will not apply to me.  I have to admit, I am not in favor of changes when you sign-up for something, you are locked in, then the rule change.  Not very comfortable with this way of doing things.  I am all for changes and progress. But when there are some changes, investors should have an option to get out.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-13 10:43:16 UTC | #12

I agree that confirmation could be automated.  I’m not sure that’s a problem though.  In a way it is an active step toward meeting a minimum threshold for active participation.  I wouldn’t want this automation made available through the NNS dApp, but if someone finds it easier to write a script than pushing a button twice a year then more power to them.  That kind of active participation seems to meet the intent of the proposal.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-13 10:44:52 UTC | #13

I think it kinda defeats the purpose of this proposal, at the very least there should be a captcha when confirming a followee.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-13 10:52:22 UTC | #14

Ok that makes sense.  Thanks for the clarification.

By the way, I also agree with your comments about voting on exchange rate proposals.  It seems unnecessary.  Their benefit from a tokenomics perspective is to ensure daily voting rewards, but their drawback is that they dilute incentives to participate in governance proposals.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-13 10:53:27 UTC | #15

I like that idea too.

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-13 12:44:28 UTC | #16

In my opinion, your point regarding political parties is the best mental framework for understanding this proposal.  The current state of the NNS is the equivalent of signing up for a political party when you reach voting age and then that being your default vote for all future elections unless you actively change it (including after your death!).  This proposal would make the NNS more like a bi-annual election where you confirm your political party.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-14 23:56:51 UTC | #17

This proposal seems a little "paternalist". "Set and forget" should be an acceptable norm. Any "minimum standard for active participation" is meaningless. A right without the right of abstention is not a real right. Indeed, we should add an abstain button to the existing adopt-reject system, and any neuron not voting should be considered as abstaining automatically. Don't forget that we come into the blockchain world for freedom, not for something else.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-04-15 00:07:46 UTC | #18

Everyone deserves ICP, if ICP is good. We should be nicer to all the ICP hodlers, since they are already hurt more or less by the price "dumping". NNS is not perfect, but in my opinion it is already the best DAO all over the world and even throughout the human history. And I do think NNS should be designed by Minimalism. Don't make it too much complicated because it may scare people outside the IC community. We should welcome more and more people into ICP instead of making it a zero-sum game.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2022-04-16 04:20:26 UTC | #19

@wpb @Kyle_Langham I believe there is good intent with this proposal and I think there are solid reasons to adopt it. Kyle said something on his podcast that made a lot of sense. Something along the lines of “if a stakeholder dies without transferring their Auth device do we really want their voting power going to the same neuron forever?”

That being said. I would appreciate if you consider adding an initial 6 month delay from the day this proposal is implemented. By that I mean that if/when this change is pushed to the NNS it would set all existing neurons to a 6-month countdown before the initial reset takes place instead of a 1-month delay.

1 month seems too short given how long it has taken existing stakeholders to update their follower settings after the last reset. Also, Dfinity may need extra time to push this same functionality to the ledger app for seed investors who may not be capable of updating their settings.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-16 14:05:33 UTC | #20

@LightningLad91 thank you for this suggestion.  I think we may be able to compromise on this detail, but 6 months from implementation is too long in our opinion.  

The notification to the community about this change, if adopted, starts on the day this proposal is submitted.  We don’t know how long it will take Dfinity to develop the code to make these changes, but if proposal 34485 is a good indicator then it would suggest 2 months.  That would mean 8 more months of incentives for spam proposals if 6 months were the initial Followee confirmation period.  We would much rather see incentives for spam proposals eliminated within the next 3 months, which is how we arrived at an initial confirmation period of 1 month.  I’d rather see it advertised and promoted by the community and by Dfinity that this change is coming the moment this proposal passes…if it passes.  

To be honest, I don’t think advance warning is what will drive people to confirm their Followees.  I think the financial incentives that this proposal intends to activate is what will be the most effective tool at getting people to recognize the need to periodically re-commit to their selections.  Just like implementation of proposal 34485, I expect there to be very little participation until the financial incentives exist to drive participation.  It only took a few weeks to see significant changes.  The majority of that happened after the voting rewards actually changed, but there was relatively little movement until they changed.

Do you have an alternate suggestion for how to word this detail in the proposal in a way that targets 3 months from proposal submittal as the turnaround time for asking everyone to re-confirm their Followee selections?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-16 14:15:09 UTC | #21

Perhaps a solution to you concern could be a separate proposal asking dfinity to provide announcements of pending and past tokenomics changes in the NNS dApp.  These announcements could include approx timing, high level summary details, and links to forum topics that describe more details.  That puts these announcements exactly where they are needed the most and gives visibility to the changes at a time when people are already thinking about neuron configurations and governance participation.

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-16 21:38:11 UTC | #22

I like the idea, a lot. I'd suggest that the implementation be simpler. If every follow was simply a 6 month follow, with no exceptions: you could simply add a timer to the follow (UX and B/E). Add a "refollow" button (or similar) that becomes available only within a month of expiration.

Also, enable it with the 3 month timeline. The spam sucks, but it isn't actually exploiting anything, the only thing suffering is non-voting neurons rewards, and our attention. The spam should go away after the first "unfollowing."

If I understand correctly, the implementation of this proposal will not stop the next 6 months of garbage proposals

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-04-18 21:49:52 UTC | #25

I think it adds more actions for the end user without many benefits, to the system or to the voter.

Also adds more work for dfinity team.

What is projected behaviour every 6 mths ppl will change their followee? 

-the ones interested in changing their followee option will do so at any given time

-the ones that choose one just to keep getting their reward will chose the same or random pick from the list the ones on top

I think the current spamming situation created an overthinking situation.

Where there are incentives there will be different dynamics. We got here as the governance topics are incentivized differently to make ppl vote. this is the other side of the coin.

instead of making things simpler and removing the different weight, we make them more complicated not treating the root cause.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-18 23:01:47 UTC | #26

It is not expected that people will change their Followee selection every 6 months.  This proposal does not require that action.  It only requires re-confirmation of Followee selection in order to prevent your Followee selections to be reset.

justmythoughts | 2022-04-20 01:54:53 UTC | #28

For visibility and since this proposal is now live, bringing in my argument against this proposal and any periodic reset and confirmation of neuron followees that was given in https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248/18 (a very similar proposal)

[quote="justmythoughts, post:18, topic:12248"]
If we pass this proposal and reset the followees - the spammer wins.

They are rewarded and receive even more governance rewards in the short term - while less active participants get punished. This goes on until we get back to a similar point that we’re at today, maybe 3 to 4 months down the line when there are more passive retail investors that have “caught on” to the resets. Then another reset is passed.

Fast forward a year and people are now on top of when the resets happen, and reset their followees exactly on “NNS Reset Day”. Immediately after each reset the voters go passive and let the followees to all the work. We haven’t solved spam on the IC, and all spam including malicious links/photos/language are front and center visible to voters. The only thing we’ve done is made voters aware of when the reset day is, and depending on your perspective we stole/transfered governance rewards from less active participants to more active participants (including the spammer) during each reset of this process.

It doesn’t solve the actual problem of spam or non-actionable proposals being submitted to the IC, and rewards the spammer.

I can see how IC Maxi and current active IC participants will support this proposal, but it will turn away new investors who don’t want that type of commitment. No other blockchain that I’m aware of requires this type of active commitment from their investors, so we’d be drawing a firm line separating the IC from other blockchains. I’d imagine this would scare off retail, larger investors, and anyone who doesn’t like to obsess over/check their investments weekly.

I’m thinking about all of my tech, non-tech, and developer friends. Some are investors, some are staked in cryptocurrencies, but none would want to spend this much time thinking about the IC or any other investment/blockchain. @wpb you, I and many others on this forum are in the 5% of early adopters that are obsessed with this project and forum. We have to think about those outside of our bubble who don’t even know about the IC yet, or those who will never check the forums as many times in a day as you or I.

Why should any retail investor or firm buy ICP if this passes?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-20 02:11:39 UTC | #29

I don't think we should let spam proposals constraint us, its an issue that is being dealt with and won't be fixed with a silver bullet but a series of changes to the NNS (higher costs, fixed weekly quotas for rewards, proposal reviews, etc..).

I also understand your concerns on making the NNS less appealing to investors looking for a more standard approach to staking, personally I'd rather have less ICPs staked by informed investors than more by mindless ones just looking to hedge their capital, even if it goes against my financial interests. The NNS is the make or break of this project, we must make sure it functions in the best way possible and I don't see that happening if some random neurons keep their voting power regardless of what they do cause their followers just care about the APY or are deceased and can't unfollow. 

A proposal recently passed that forces all stakers to be affected by a multiplier on their maturity, now that is something that keeps away investors, if I stake I dont want to care about the market trends, but soon I'll have too. If pressing a button twice a year is too much for some people then they shouldn't be staking in the NNS, I know it may sound harsh but thats my 2 cents.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2022-04-20 10:27:35 UTC | #30

First of all I want to thank you for taking the time putting up this proposal, I really appreciate your input and contributions towards the ecosystem. We need more individuals like you! The following statements have been written in a rush, so please don't take them as an offense if they sound harsh  :slight_smile: 

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:12109"]
This proposal aims to remove this incentive by establishing a minimum standard for active participation in governance that will strongly motivate all neuron owners to actively configure Followees and periodically confirm their selections.
[/quote]

I don't think there's a lack of motivation, there's simply a lack of knowledge of the current situation. The motivation is there already because people significantly miss out on voting rewards as we speak. Every rational individual would take action if they *knew* they had to take action.

If this proposal passes, nothing really changes except that people will miss out even more on rewards. We need awareness.

I still think this proposal is well intended, but it won't solve the problem it tries to solve. Also if it passes the parties involved are imo responsible for an education campaign.

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:12109"]
Staking is not intended to be just a source of yield farming. We should expect that anyone who stakes must remain sufficiently active to know how to participate in governance and are doing so by this minimum standard of active participation.
[/quote]

I disagree. I've been around this project for the past 3 years and never heard DFINITY say or promote anything along those lines. They even provided a solution to stay passive which is liquid democracy by following neurons.

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:12109"]
. Now that proposal weights have been implemented, participation is up to 45% of total voting power.
[/quote]
How does this change directly affect the voting participation?

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:12109"]
A whopping 55% of total voting power is not voting on governance proposals and the most likely way to get them to start participating is to double down on the previous tokenomics tweak by removing default following for All Topics if the neuron owner does not actively confirm their Followee selections
[/quote]

I really don't believe this is the case, without a campaign promoting those changes the participation will go down even more and we'll be in a worse situation. So keep things the way they are for now and promote the changes that lead to this situation in the first place first, after that we can evaluate further steps.

[quote="wpb, post:1, topic:12109"]
Reduces the probability that someone will produce spam proposals for personal gain.

How will that work? Are you assuming this will lead to more people setting up follow targets for the governance topic or is there something else I am missing?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-20 14:07:03 UTC | #31

Thanks for your feedback @cryptoschindler.  As always, you make excellent points and provide valuable feedback.  I think the best explanation of why this proposal works can be found in my previous response I made to @Zane.  Please see the link provided below.

I agree with your assessment that more advertisement is needed, but I also think a tokenomics incentive is also needed.  Voting participation has flat lined at 46% and it’s been that way since approx late March in spite of the spam proposals.  

[quote="cryptoschindler, post:30, topic:12109"]
I’ve been around this project for the past 3 years and never heard DFINITY say or promote anything along those lines.
[/quote]

I agree the statement is my interpretation, but I don’t think it’s too far off.  It is the take home message I get when I read the [tokenomics white paper](https://medium.com/dfinity/understanding-the-internet-computers-network-nervous-system-neurons-and-icp-utility-tokens-730dab65cae8) that was published before genesis.  It is also my read on the comments provided by @jwiegley and @diegop in the first 15 minutes of the [Internet Computer Weekly podcast episode 28](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-internet-computer-review/id1569570770?i=1000548495007) with @Arthur Falls.  I’m not saying they said this directly, but I am saying it is my interpretation of how the system is supposed to work after carefully listening, reading, and thinking about ICP tokenomics for the last 11 months.

I'm all for this proposal. Set and forget is definitely not acceptable. If people can't adjust their neuron(s) every 6 months, sounds pretty problematic.

So, personally, thank you @wpb for bringing this up. As always, you rock.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-04-20 13:54:28 UTC | #33

Would be great if the button for confirming neuron followees is always active, then we can keep resetting the timer to 6 months anytime without having to change followees, rather than only doing it when it expires.

-------------------------

singularity | 2022-04-20 13:59:29 UTC | #34

Can we click confirm to reset anytime rather than having to wait 6 months to do it?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-20 14:04:37 UTC | #35

Yes, the intent of the confirmation button and timer is to enable users to confirm at their convenience before the timer expires.  Confirmation can occur any time and will reset the timer every time.

coteclaude | 2022-04-29 01:36:09 UTC | #36

@levi Question for you.  How would you manage dead people or inactive-lost account from voting.  You would not want a dead person, who have set his following, to vote and make a difference for a proposal to pass or not, right?
I don't see any other way then confirming your following on a regular basis.

You would not want a dead person, who have set his following, to vote and make a difference for a proposal to pass or not, right?

I don’t see it as a big problem.

I can’t say I have the best answer for how to best handle those situations but I think it’s a similar problem as someone leaving icp in their accounts and losing the account for whatever reason. Maybe the solution for things like that is with an on-chain in-sync government id database where users can match their accounts with their ids.

How will that work? Are you assuming this will lead to more people setting up follow targets for the governance topic or is there something else I am missing?

Haha why not reset all the followers right away ser, that seems like the way to achieve full decentralization. its not the race against the time we should be worried about, rather its the NNS biting its own tail is what we should be afraid of.

hey…relax it’s the weekend…take it easy…what ever fuck up ( or maybe not) you think you made is already done. Just take your Girlfriend or Boyfriend out for a drink, get a massage or something ( have you try Yoga ;) ). stop watching CMC. you are not going to influence anybody in this forum. Smart people hang around here!!

Hey @darien,

I appreciate you following the spammer all over the forums trying to defend the IC community, but your posts themselves created spam, and I would appreciate it in the future if you just flagged the spammer's posts without replying (they get hidden after the fact). 

I got notified like 10 times from your responses.

Again thanks for the good intentions, but no need to be a superhero! The forums already have a flagging mechanism :slight_smile:

I agree, the main aim here is to squeeze % or two out of sleepy investors.
If voted in will distroy investor confidence.
