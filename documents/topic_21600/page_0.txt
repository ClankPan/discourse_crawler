I had a hard reset of my system, but before doing that I exported and saved the pem file.
now I have successfully imported my account and I ran `dfx quickstart` command, it's asking me to either export or create another wallet.
I had created a cycle's wallet in the past. is there any way to get the principal of previously created wallet?

There's no guaranteed way, but something like https://icscan.io/ probably has your principal linked to the wallet. You can get your principal with `dfx identity get-principal`
