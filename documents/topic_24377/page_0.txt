# icRouter

icRouter is a token cross-chain infrastructure and a router for Dex pairs.

## Cross-chain

A cross-chain network of assets based on threshold signature technology, with no off-chain bridges, supporting Bitcoin, IC, and EVM networks (e.g., Ethereum).

## Dex-router

DexRouter is a router for DEX trading pairs on IC blockchain, through which you can get the list of trading pairs or get the trading pairs for a specified token.

We have now completed the integration of bitcoin and ethereum testnet. The ethereum main network will be available in the near future.

Please give feedback.

Hi there, are y going to integrate any other chains ? besides btc and eth.

Can you give a TLDR of how it works here? Does each IC token get an ERC20 contract created for it on the target network?

Let me know when you guys are ready for EVM prod as we have some OGYs that we've allocated to push over to put up on some something like UNISwap DEXs. :)

Yes, most EVM networks will be supported in the future.

The priority now is to launch the mainnet.
IC -> Ethereum integration will be the next priority
