Hello there!

The NNS proposal is here: [IC NNS Proposal 80992](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80992).

Here is a summary of the changes since the last release:

```
* Consensus: Add size check for XNet in payload.rs
* Consensus: Improve Errors in Dkg Key Manger
* Crypto: Fix should_reject_truncated_ecdsa_pubkey() failing with a higher OpenSSL version
* Crypto: Implement ErrorReplication for DkgLoadTranscriptError and DkgKeyRemovalError
* Crypto: Initialize the registry before creating the crypto component
* Crypto: Unify mapping from tarpc::client::RpcError to internal error
* Execution: Add an optional argument to NotifyCreateCanister to choose subnet type
* Execution: Add new field for subnet-type based canister creation in CMC
* Execution: Add proposals to manage subnet types in CMC
* Execution: Add scaffold for bitcoin_get_successors endpoint.
* Execution: Allow only one install code execution at any time - dts
* Execution: Bitcoin: Add candid interface for `BitcoinGetSuccessors`.
* Execution: Implement change_subnet_type_assignment endpoint
* Execution: Implement update_subnet_type endpoint on CMC
* Execution: Improvements in subnet type management in CMC
* Execution: Stable Structures: Add `MemoryManager` to simulate multiple memories
* Execution: add non-subsidised storage cost on 20+ node subnets (behind the flag)
* Message Routing: Drop `StateMetadata::id_counter` from canonical state
* Message Routing: Fix rare race condition in take_tip
* Message Routing: Persist metadata less often and do not hold a lock during
* Message Routing: pre-populate prev_state_hash on tip checkout in all paths
* Networking: Canister http test to check that transform function is executed.
* Networking: Fixing receive check code to avoid unsafe unwrap
* Networking: Make canister http pricing more user friendly
* Node: Basic SNP test to test if SNP is enabled on the VM
* Node: Update baseimg sha for guestos-dev
* Orchestrator: During the node registration use the NNS urls from the config
* Orchestrator: Reduce the max amount of SSH keys
* Runtime: Abort paused executions above the limit
* Runtime: Break canister execution loop after long executions
* Runtime: Record compilation cost with compilation benchmarks
* Runtime: Record function size/complexity in errors

I cannot support this proposal until more clarity is given on the included changes to storage cost - [discussion here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-regarding-re-exc-1168-add-non-subsidised-storage-cost-on-20-node-subnets-behind-the-flag/15420/6). Or, at least some real timeline is given on [storage subnets](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-storage-subnets-proposal/9390).

Incredible that Dfinity would slip in something as consequential as this change without prior notice to the community.

There are no changes to storage costs in this replica version.

[/quote]

I see this in the release notes.

Diego addressed my immediate [concerns here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-regarding-re-exc-118-add-non-subsidised-storage-cost-on-20-node-subnets-behind-the-flag/15420/11?u=hazel) regarding the above code change. I feel fine moving forward with this for now.

Right, but as the commit says, it's hidden behind a [feature flag](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/8a5509ebb162d084d8b38fc5213f3a78c9fc9801/rs/cycles_account_manager/src/lib.rs#L38), so there is no functional change.
