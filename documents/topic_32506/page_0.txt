I have devloped a project and tried to acces on multiple devices by replacing the 127.0.0.1 with the  ip adress of my devices but i go the error my ip adress have refused the connection. Then i tried to create multiple identites using the local internet identity canister but of them ended up logging to the same account of the dapp. Is there a solution for this problem, i want to test my dapp with multiple accounts on it without deploying it to the mainnet.
