Hi all,

As promised in [a previous forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increasing-decentralization-reducing-icp-inflation-with-a-single-proposal/30953/92?u=lara), we are following up with a more concrete design for periodic confirmation.

## TL;DR

* We follow up on the approved motion proposal on periodic confirmation and propose a design.
* A neuron has to regularly take one of the following actions: directly vote, set following, confirm following.
* If a neuron fails to do any of these actions for 5 months, the neurons’ voting power will be decreased until it reaches zero after 6 months of inactivity.
* The voting power of all other neurons is not affected.

## Context / Motivation

The main idea of periodic confirmation is that in order to get rewards, governance participants have to remain active voters and regularly confirm their following settings. Neurons who set following once and then never interact with the NNS again get lower, adjusted voting rewards. In particular, neurons who were created with default following and never made an active decision who to follow, have to do so in order to keep getting voting rewards.

The original proposal was adopted by the NNS community in the [NNS proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).

Today, the main motivations for periodic confirmation are

1. In order to get voting rewards, every neuron has to make an active decision who to follow - default following is not enough.
2. Followers are regularly incentivised to reconsider their following choice.

## Design

On a high level, the proposed design suggests the following.

1. In order to get voting rewards and have voting power, a neuron has to **regularly vote directly, set following, or confirm the current following settings**.
2. If a neuron does not take any of the above actions, the **neuron’s voting power is adjusted**. After **5 months of no action**, the neuron’ voting power is linearly decreased for one month until it **reaches zero at the end of 6 months** without any action.

To track this, each **neuron has a new field** indicating the **last time when it took any of the above actions**.

### Relevant actions

Confirmation of following is the main action that was suggested in the motion proposal.
In addition, the design includes set following and direct voting. Setting following also reflects an explicit choice by the neuron who to follow. Direct voting is included because a neuron that always votes directly and does not rely on following is a very active governance participant and should not have adjusted voting power or adjusted voting rewards.

### Details Adjustment

“Sleeper” neurons, who don’t take any of the above actions for more than 6 months, should not be automatically participating in voting and getting voting rewards. This design suggests to realize this by adjusting their **voting power**.

#### Proposal lifecycle

Let’s recall the proposal life cycle to understand the new design better.

1. When a proposal is submitted to the NNS, the NNS takes a snapshot of all neurons and
    a. Establishes which neurons are eligible, meaning that they have a dissolve delay that is at least 6 months.
   b. Stores an empty ballot for each eligible neuron with the neuron’s voting power.
   c. The sum of all neurons’ voting power is the _total voting power_ that is taken into account for the decision.

2. Once a day voting rewards are computed for decided proposals by
  a. Considering the reward pool for that day
  b. Looking at all proposals and neurons and considering
    * i. The total voting power that could have been used if all neurons participated
    * ii. In how much proposals and with how much voting power each neuron participated compared to this total

#### Voting power adjustment

This design proposes that

* For each proposal and neuron, in the **ballot** (Step 1.c.) consider the **adjusted voting power**. That is, record less voting power for neurons that have not taken any of the above actions for the last 5 months.
* For each proposal, distinguish
  * the **total (potential) voting power**, which is the sum of all neurons’ voting power if they were fully participating and without the adjustment
  * the **total adjusted voting power**, which is the sum of all neurons’ adjusted voting power that can contribute to the decision
* For each proposal,
  * **consider the total adjusted voting power for deciding proposals**.
  * **consider the (potential) voting power when computing the rewards**. This is similar to Step 2.b.i in that the rewards take into account the voting power "if all neurons participated".

#### Effect of the voting power adjustment

Adjusting the voting power in this way has the following consequences.

* Sleeper-neurons are not considered in the decision making process. This means that proposals can still be decided quickly if the majority of the regularly active voters agree quickly. (Also see “Alternatives considered” below).
* [A while ago](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/financial-spam-prevention-nns-implementation-update/18917), NNS governance was changed so that the reward pool is based on the available voting power rather than just on the voting power that was exercised. This was introduced to combat spam and also has the advantage that less rewards are produced in the case where there are a lot of sleeper neurons. Considering the total potential voting power in the new design follows the same ideas and preserves these advantages.
* If a neuron has been sleeping for more than 6 months, then the voting power recorded for the neuron in any open proposal is zero. This might be unexpected for a neuron that has been sleeping and comes back on some day to directly vote on a proposal - the direct vote would be recorded with zero voting power. However, this also has some advantages. First, to ensure this is not confusing, the behavior can be explained on frontends with a UI and can serve as an additional nudge for the neuron to reconsider and confirm the following. Second, if a neuron has not confirmed or set following or actively voted in more than 6 months, it can be an advantage for the governance process that this neuron cannot simply show up on one day and swing a proposal in an unexpected way.

#### Alternatives considered

**Alternative 1. Reset of following: The original proposal suggested completely removing the following for neurons that don’t confirm following.**

Compared to the current design, this has the disadvantage that sleepers would still be counted towards the total voting power for making decisions. As a consequence, if there are many sleepers, it would be hard or impossible to reach quick decisions for urgent proposals such as fixes to security bugs.

This is illustrated in the following graphs where the proposed design is compared with a reset of following. The lines depict voting power over time, where blue represents a sleeper neuron, pink a neuron that remains active, and purple the overall voting power. The solid lines show the voting power that can be used by the neurons and the total voting power that is considered for decisions. The dotted lines indicate the voting power that these neurons are exercising and the total voting power that can be exercised with the current level of activity. In the right graph you can see that when the total voting power for decisions includes the sleepers, the effectively used voting power cannot reach 50% of the voting power and fast decision are not possible.

![|624x299](upload://n3M3vULntKNJrVUB2a8uMti9XAo.jpeg)

When urgent proposals in the context of periodic confirmation were discussed in the past, some community members suggested taking into account the active voting power from the last few proposals. The current design follows a similar idea as it also does not account for the sleepers’ voting power in the decision making process.

**Alternative 2. Adjustment of the voting rewards, but not the voting power: We also considered not adjusting the voting power and just adjusting the rewards of neurons who don’t confirm following.**

This would have similar disadvantages as explained for Alternative 1. In addition, this would mean that sleeper neurons would still contribute to the decisions with their full voting power - even though they would not receive rewards for it, this still does not seem to be in line with the proposal’s intention.

### Who can perform the relevant actions?

Already now, direct voting and setting of following can be done by a neuron’s controller or its hotkeys. The same permission should apply for confirmation of following.

This means that a neuron can take any of the relevant actions (which will also reset the timer) with its controller or hotkey, which is in line with the original proposal and ensures that the feature can be implemented in a user-friendly way.

## NNS dapp

For the NNS dapp, the main functionality of the feature will be visible in the [neuron overview page](https://nns.ic0.app/neurons/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai), where a user can see all their neurons. This page will include a warning if at least one of the user’s neurons has not confirmed following for the last 5 months and has adjusted voting power. It will also include a button that allows the user to confirm following for all their neurons.

In addition, the new neuron field is shown as a timer indicating how much time a neuron has left to take action before the voting power will be adjusted. Since this is a property of each individual neuron, this is shown in the neuron detail page. In the neuron detail page, in addition to a button to set following, there will also be an option to confirm following for this neuron.

In the [voting view](https://nns.ic0.app/proposals/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai), there will be a new explanation in the case where a neuron’s voting does not have any effect due to voting power adjustment (the case discussed in Section “Effect of the voting power adjustment”). This will explain to the user why they observe the current behavior and encourage them to take action to reset their neuron’s timer.

The timer is reset if the neuron votes directly (manually using the “vote” buttons rather than by following), if the user sets following for a neuron, or if the user uses the confirm following button, either for this neuron or for all neurons on the overview page.

We are currently working on the design of this and are happy to share more information and graphics once we have them.

## Next steps

If there are no concerns with the proposed design, we will start working on the implementation of the feature. One of the first steps will be to finalize the detailed APIs. For this, it is particularly important to reach as many frontend and custody providers as possible who will need to integrate with this feature.

In addition to reaching the integrating teams, this feature needs to be communicated widely to reach as many end-users as possible and ensure that they will not unexpectedly lose rewards.


We thank everyone for their feedback and look forward to taking this feature to the next step!

This is amazing @lara.  It is very consistent with the desired outcome of the original proposal and I think the voting power adjustment feature is genius.  That seems to resolve the issue with being able to reach quick decisions for urgent proposals.  A lot of people should be very happy with the impact of this change.

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2024-08-16 22:46:52 UTC | #4

Well written, @lara, as usual.

How did you arrive at the duration of 5 months before voting power begins degrading? Is there a reason this period is preferable to what might be a simpler, more rounded biannual confirmation?

-------------------------

tiago89 | 2024-08-17 07:46:56 UTC | #5

I like it overall, 

I find it unnecessary / not valuable the feature of linear degrading of 1 month.

In the long term, voters will have ways to avoid ever reaching the 5 months without confirming, it doesn't make much diff between a linear slow down of 1 month and the sudden stop at month 6. But it might be much easier and simpler on the code / implementation.

What matters is that users get warned on the frontend (NNS dApp) and with time, find effective ways to periodically confirm. The one month can be the strong warning period, no need to yet impact on the Voting Power and Rewards.

About the other alternatives considered (1 and 2), agree that the proposed one is much better.

Looking forward for it's implementation and it's impact both short term and long term.

Hopefully it's a success and it can be considered to be implemented on SNSs too 😏

-------------------------

skilesare | 2024-08-17 12:19:37 UTC | #6

What is the definition of "directly vote?"  Are votes via hot-key, such as on OpenChat or other services considered "directly voting?"

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-08-17 12:39:26 UTC | #7

Can I ask what the point of this is, now that we have canister-controlled neurons? 

Maybe my point needs to be on it's own thread and a lot of the NNS design points need to be discussed - but since this is a new addition and requires new development work maybe we need to think about it a bit more?

I could just stake a neuron in a canister and slap in a timer to confirm the following every few weeks and come back in a few years having done nothing and never participated in governance? This would make this update pointless then right?

Or I could just create a canister with a timer and set it as my hotkey on my NNS UI neuron and confirm my following?

If someone were to take this action, then it doesn’t seem like they would be a sleeper neuron.  They would be aware of the rules and taking actions that enable them to continue to participate and get rewarded.  That seems like a good thing.  Why not let them do it?  

I also wonder how many people could actually pull this off.  Devs can do it
of course and would likely get away with it indefinitely.  Some may even be willing to make it a public service.  However, the internet computer protocol is a mutable system and there is always the risk that the NNS governing body could shut down a canister that is providing this service.

To be honest, the actions required to satisfy the requirements proposed here are so incredibly easy that I’m not sure why anyone, including a dev with skills, would even put in the time and energy needed to build this canister.  Seems like way more work than just voting or clicking a button twice a year, which I suspect most people who care are already doing anyway.

Do you think it's fair to give governance advantages to developers then, and not give that luxury to the users?

Ye, that's why I'm saying, what is the point of this update then? Devs can easily overcome it and / or create a service to overcome it and it's not really that much hassle for users to click a button twice a year?

(A canister as a hotkey that confirms the following twice a year is not much work)

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-08-17 13:05:33 UTC | #10

How are you an active governance participant by clicking a confirm button twice a year. It's like saying your an active driver by turning on your car twice a year.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-08-17 13:30:18 UTC | #11

Well, voting manually is active governance.

Also, choosing your Followees or confirming your Followees is active governance.

According to this proposal, that amounts to performing the very simple tasks of voting or clicking a button twice a year.  That’s not a big ask.

If a developer wants to spend their time trying to automate a system that gets around these simple tasks, then I say more power to them.  Go for it.  That by no means gives them an advantage over everyone else.  It just makes them willing to put in extra work that most people would likely see as unnecessary.

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-08-17 13:22:39 UTC | #12

Okay, I will probably create some canister functionality to overcome it. That's why I asked what the point of this is (I am not bothered clicking a confirm button twice a year).

wpb | 2024-08-17 13:29:42 UTC | #13

I think that’s awesome.  You are an OG of the ICP ecosystem and have always been active.  I suspect most people would agree that you are actively participating in NNS governance by taking this extra step.

Thanks man, I don't have a badge that says that but I have been around awhile :smile: 

Others like me could automate this too, anyway, it does feel like we're adding more friction sometimes to these things, I want to see things become easier, not more effort / harder (it's not that much effort to confirm, but a user will need to now learn and understand what the confirmation means). 

I like to vote sometimes on governance and SNS proposals, but I just can't see the value on adding a confirmation button to confirm my following. I would like to see Dfinity dev effort focus on more pressing issues like atomic DeFi or adding badland boundary nodes.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-08-17 13:58:16 UTC | #15

I’d like to respectfully ask you to consider not automating a yes or no vote with your canister if you choose to satisfy the requirement of this proposal via voting with your canister.  You are a known neuron [rakeoff.io](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/named-neuron-proposal-rakeoff-io/23450), so hopefully you are interested in making sure your vote is always cast in the long term best interest of the internet computer on every proposal.  For any proposal topic that you don’t review and vote manually, there are other neurons that you could follow that perform due diligence on those proposal topics.  It would be awesome to see you follow them with your vote.  I don’t have a strongly held opinion on who you follow as long as it’s a vote that is cast in educated and informed way.  I believe there are people that have already built canisters that have all the components that you need.  CodeGov has code that watches for CodeGov NNS votes and relays those votes to a CodeGov WTN neuron.  Taggr and WaterNeuron both have code that casts their NNS votes according to results of a poll in their respective communities.  In both cases they also have backup solutions in case the polls they are watching don’t reach consensus…they end up voting no at the end of the voting period.  An automated voting solution that merges this open source code would be a nice solution to your automation plans if it is based on voting.

-------------------------

dfxjesse | 2024-08-17 13:50:36 UTC | #16

Who said anything about automating yes or no votes? I was talking about automating the confirmation of the following.

-------------------------

wpb | 2024-08-17 14:03:19 UTC | #17

That’s why is said “…if you plan to automate voting…”

By the way, if you are already voting directly or via hotkey, then you are already satisfying the requirements of this proposal.  You don’t need to also confirm Followee selections.  That would be unnecessary redundancy.

Doudi | 2024-08-19 18:09:36 UTC | #21



Seriously, @Lara, can we strongly consider **adding** a "**Proof of Humanhood**" to the voting process? It could help address concerns about automation and ensure fair participation.

@Jan, I imagine that Dfinity has automated the process of following and voting for The foundation's neurons, with neurons created as they mature etc. ( Can you confirm ?). Given this, a Proof of Humanhood might complicate things. Is this the reason you’re hesitant to push this solution forward?

I’m interested in this topic, and I think GeekFactory might be as well, especially to ensure fairness between devs and non-devs. It’s definitely useful when managing multiple neurons or IDs.

End note : It’s amusing to see @wpb advocating for automation while suggesting that NNS remove entities to facilitate this automation for everyone. What a fascinating mind !

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-19 14:24:14 UTC | #22

This doesn’t seem to address the root of the problem at all to me. It seems as though it has been complicated to avoid the removal of following.

Periodic Followee Confirmation, while many won’t admit it, aims to ensure that the followee is consciously choosing to delegate their vote to the selected entity. 

Rather than this system forcing them to re-delegate their voting power, they must instead simply cast a vote, detracting from the core value of the function - the conscious decision to follow a specific party. 

I also find issue in the fact that barriers that were previously brought up to me in regard to this topic, have now been forsaken, due to the fact that “friends” are pushing the proposal through. 

For example, what is the notification campaign on this feature? It was previously suggested that no less than an email campaign be followed through according to DFINITYs mailing list. 

What about the fact that “DFINITY shouldn’t be pushing or forcing this, it should come from the community themselves”?

Proposals have passed on this topic before, and they were ignored, because it wasn’t convenient for DFINITY. Quite frankly, without using “we’re the foundation, we built this” or “trust me”, why should we trust you to have the best interests now, and not just be doing this out of convenience for yourselves..?

If you actually read my comments then you would see that my position is so what, who cares, roll my eyes at the idea of automating around this proposal.  It should take way more work than it’s worth compared to just meeting the minimum expectations.  In no way do I think that the fact that someone could perform this automation should be a reason not to proceed.  It’s an idea that should not be allowed by the majority to stifle the conversation.

My interpretation of this proposal is that the vote that is cast must be triggered manually instead of using a Followee.  Do you interpret it differently?  The controller of the neuron that votes may have multiple neuron and may also have hotkey control of other neurons belonging to a different controller.  As a matter of convenience for users, voting manually with any one of these neurons will satisfy the need to vote manually.  I think the assumption that is being made, which I think is reasonable, is that if you vote manually then you are performing an act of active NNS governance.  If you vote manually, then you likely know your Followee selections and have made intentional choices about who to follow.  If you think this is an unreasonable assumption, would you please clarify why?

-------------------------

daeitus | 2024-08-19 20:48:24 UTC | #25

this sounds like a significant disincentive to staking on the nns versus elsewhere. also pointless complexity as @dfxjesse explained. the original proposal should be be revisited, since it was made over two years ago and opinions have likely changed.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-19 21:24:25 UTC | #26

This isn’t periodic confirmation, this is saying “they cast a vote so they *probably* know who they’re following, otherwise the NNS will directly reduce their APY”. Please don’t conflate the two.

If they don’t cast the vote, remove the following - why keep it & just remove voting power (APY)? Surely you see how removing voting power from the system makes your fear of a 51% even more plausible? 

Can you also help me understand how it is that none of your previous concern are a problem now?

I highly recommend you read through the latest comprehensive discussion about increasing decentralization.  I think you have been busy with other things recently and may not have noticed, but real progress is happening.  Topics like periodic confirmation of neuron followees and grants for voting neurons have finally made it to the top of the priority list on the roadmap for DFINITY.  The concrete proposals that have been offered are really quite good.  

Below is the conclusion from the previous thread, but it really is a good read from the beginning because lots of people in the community offered well reasoned and civilized feedback.

Hi everyone

I strongly disagree with this idea.

Investors such as myself will be put through yet another hurdle and lowers confindence, whats next ? What else will be changed? All because youd like to lower infatuation. 

It feels like a carrot has been dangled and now hulla hoops are needed to be jumped through in order to reach 14.9% interest.

Im sure its okey for the majority of people on this forum as its no change to them to vote manually but think bigger than yoursleves think about investor confidence and what we all originally signed up for.

This will lower investor confidence and force them to look elsewhere.

There are many people that share your opinion.  It is a fair opinion.  

The debate and voting on proposals like this will always reflect a balance between those who want no change and those who see change as necessary.  

I also think it’s important to remember that ICP is a utility token and the tokenomics are 100% aligned with awarding governance participation.  We don’t get paid for staking.  We get paid for voting.  That should be clear to everyone before they sign up for any ICP governance participation to recieve rewards.  In my opinion, this proposal helps remind people of that commitment.  We should not fool ourselves into thinking that we have invested in a set and forget asset.  The NNS is intentionally designed to be mutable, which by definition means people need to remain aware of changes and vote according to their convictions.  I think the community has a big role to play in reminding ourselves that our tokenomics are not like other investments even if we want them to be.  We are all offered governance rewards to stay active in that governance process.

Same thoughts,

If people want to reduce inflation, they should lower the staking rewards that we are earning. This will eventually be reflected in the ICP price going up. The only thing ICP needs is more profit coming into the ecosystem. That's how we will all earn more, not through these tricks.

Alternatively, they could change the voting reward function. For example, after 8+ years, inflation could be at 5%, but after 20+ years, it could decrease to 3.5%, etc.

The only way for stakers to really earn money is by burning cycles, growing the ecosystem, and generating profit. The goal should not be to drive away investors who stake their ICP through the NNS.

Dfinity has too much voting power. To address this, they could create another neuron and vote with that instead, requiring all active participants to switch to the new Dfinity neuron. This would make the system more decentralized while maintaining the old rules.

Although I think it's not a bad idea, I fear that investors might lose trust in the NNS.

-------------------------

Hannesd4 | 2024-08-20 11:45:33 UTC | #36

For example, I bought ICP for my godson and placed it in a neuron, so it could get big in 20 years (hopefully). Now, with these new rules, I have to manage that small neuron as well.

There should be a button in the nns or another app that confirms this for all the given neurons, also neurons that are from other internet identities!

-------------------------

Hannesd4 | 2024-08-20 11:40:20 UTC | #37

That's also true. But it should be made clear that we only earn by voting and that it's necessary that for people to stay active

Below is a link to a post made by DFINITY where they pitched this idea to the community as a means for a Soft Reset.  It’s not a bad idea, but there was some good discussion about it in that thread.  If you haven’t seen it, I recommend reading the entire thread.  It offers a lot of context on how we arrived at this current proposal including talking through an idea very similar to your suggestion.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increasing-decentralization-reducing-icp-inflation-with-a-single-proposal/30953/8?u=wpb

I noticed the other day that DFINITY is now triggering 35% of total voting power in the NNS when they vote on the Governance proposal topic.  They own and directly control 19.7%, but over 15% is now choosing to follow the DFINITY neuron.  This time last year only about 7-8% was following DFINITY and within the last 2 years only about 2% was following DFINITY on the Governance and SNS topics.  Hence, over time significantly more of the NNS neurons are following DFINITY again.  This is happening in spite of the fact that the Governance and SNS topics have a proposal weight of 20x and DFINITY does not vote on a significant fraction of Governance and SNS proposals, which means those followers are losing rewards.  It’s natural for people to trust and want to follow the developer team on a project, but I think most people would argue that it has a negative impact on decentralization.  Regardless, it is the natural tendency.

You make a good point regarding 'not payed to stake but payed to vote' 

Im struggling with what the point of this actually is

1) to lower inflation 
2) shake investor (new and old) confidence by changing the way rewards are earned.
This will not have the desired effect of lowering inflation, but the opposite as new investors are.put off and 
3) Invest elsewhere ie. WaterNeron who will be the biggest winner should this proposal be successful 😉 
4) decentralisation? Which is totally bonkers way of dealing with the elephant in the room.

If it was to pass and then inflation is not lowerd and scores of would.be new investors have moved onto the next best thing what will do next ? And where does this stop ? 

So i ask you all what is the purpose of this proposal actually is ?

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2024-08-20 14:14:49 UTC | #40

I think that if NNS itself does not guarantee rewards for less active participants, they will continue to stake. Only with the help of a middleman/third party who will ensure the continuity of rewards or a service that automatically extends the reset of sleeping neurons every few weeks/months.
This is not conducive to decentralization.

-------------------------

Infinity-and-beyond | 2024-08-20 15:43:46 UTC | #41

The question is, how aggressively do we want to lower inflation.

Take a look at the hotkey section of the proposal.  Hotkeys satisfy the needs that you are describing.  The proposal is intentionally trying to make periodic confirmation easy for everyone.

Isn’t this already clear?  I haven’t created a new voting neuron in a long time, so I don’t know if the NNS dApp gives fair warning.  Hopefully it does.  Regardless, if your neuron is not voting, then it won’t get rewards.  Doesn’t that spark questions? If this isn’t clear already, then I would be in favor of adding more clarification when people choose to stake.

Sormarler | 2024-08-21 00:59:33 UTC | #44

The periodic confirmation, as initially passed, was to make voters consciously choose who they are going to follow. I am not sure if this accomplishes that.It should be a complete reset to null.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2024-08-21 13:18:06 UTC | #45

I agree that it feels important to have true resets built into the system, like term limits.

My major concern is the accumulation of power, especially with DFINITY having so much accumulated power due to the default advantages of starting the network.

From the OP: "The voting power of all other neurons is not affected"

Does this mean that for example DFINITY's neurons would not have reduced voting power as the sleeper neurons following them have their voting power reduced during the 5th month of inactivity?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-21 18:12:47 UTC | #46

Hi all, thanks for all the feedback and questions.

Let me address some of the main points that were raised - phrased and summarised in my words:

* Why does the voting power start decreasing after 5 months rather than 6 months, which would be nice as it is a biannual confirmation? Why is it not 3 months?

The idea was to pick a period that is short enough to have some effect but long enough so that it is realistic for most neurons to perform one of the actions without being a major hurdle. I think the originally proposed 6 months is a good sweet spot for this.
There is no major difference whether we start the voting power decrease at 6 months or arrive at zero voting power at 6 months. If the community prefers the former to make this a biannual confirmation, we can adjust the design accordingly.

We think that 3 months is a bit too often. We could consider having a shorter period in the beginning to see the first effects earlier - e.g., set the timer to 3 months ago so that the first neurons have to confirm within this time.
We think however that we should not go below 3 months because all integrations need enough time to prioritize and implement support for this and the communication has to reach all neuron owners so that they know they have to do this.

* Why have a decline at all and not just go from full to zero voting power?

We agree that this might not make a huge difference for NNS dapp users and similar frontends, as a warning can already be shown earlier and basically serve as a “grace period”. However, this is not true for users who interact with the NNS through a command line tool - they only learn about the neuron upon sending requests. Therefore, we still propose the decline.
Note that we don’t think this will be substantially more engineering work and, as was noted, for most users it should not complicate things as they would be prompted to take action already before the decline.

* What is the definition of “directly vote?”

This is a vote that is directly cast by a neuron’s controller or hotkey, no matter which frontend is used. But it does not include votes that are automatically registered by the governance canister due to following. Technically, any call to the neuron management function register_vote is considered a direct vote.

* Is this feature useful if one can circumvent it?

It is known that this is the case and generally it is very hard to prevent automation. The idea is that this feature likely captures a substantial portion of the voters and therefore still has a positive effect.

* Why does the design not actually reset the following? Why is there no complete reset?

We agree that there is some benefit to a full reset as it forces neurons who come back after a long time to make an active decision rather than just reactivate their account.

We can adjust the design and governance could fully remove the following settings for neurons who reached zero voting power due to the adjustment. 
This will increase the code complexity slightly as it requires a new regular job on the governance, but we can also implement this while the rest of the feature is already released (as this case is only relevant after a few months).

* Why is direct voting one of the actions considered?

This was briefly explained in the original post, but let me try to explain this better. 

The design with the voting power adjustment has advantages over the alternatives as explained in “Alternatives considered”. Consider a neuron that has no following set at all and directly votes every day. In this design, the neuron would have adjusted voting power after a while, because it does not confirm following which is just not relevant for the neuron. Adjusting the voting power of this neuron does not seem to be fair as this is a neuron that is the most active governance participant that can exist.

I think on a more practical level, neurons that directly vote on a regular basis are likely neurons that are interested and engaged and already make conscious decisions on who to follow. Also, they are likely regularly visiting the NNS dapp and would also see the prompt to confirm following.

* What is the notification campaign associated with this feature?

We plan to reach out to all the projects that we know of that integrate with the NNS and widely inform users on the channels that we have, e.g., on the forum, X, information about new feature in the NNS dapp, etc.

* Will manually vote with any one of my neurons reset the timer for all my neurons?

No, this is not the case. If a neuron votes, this will only reset the timer of this one neuron.
Note however, that if you cast a direct vote on the NNS dapp, you can select multiple or all of your neurons. If you select multiple ones, a direct vote will be cast for each of those neurons. For this feature that means that all selected neurons’ timer would be reset. This is likely how most users vote, but I wanted to clarify that it is not enough to vote e.g., with only one neuron using a command line tool.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-21 18:14:35 UTC | #47

Hi @lastmjs , I am not sure I fully understand the question.

Maybe we have to distinguish between a neuron's voting power and the voting power that the neuron induces (with all its follower's voting power). 

Which one were you referring to?

-------------------------

Doudi | 2024-08-21 19:26:26 UTC | #48

[quote="Doudi, post:21, topic:34215"]
Seriously, @Lara, can we strongly consider **adding** a “**Proof of Humanhood**” to the voting process? It could help address concerns about automation and ensure fair participation.

@Jan, I imagine that Dfinity has automated the process of following and voting for The foundation’s neurons, with neurons created as they mature etc. ( Can you confirm ?). Given this, a Proof of Humanhood might complicate things. Is this the reason you’re hesitant to push this solution forward?
[/quote]

I guess you nicely dodged my question

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2024-08-21 23:10:28 UTC | #49

I think that in the future there will be a huge demand for automatic refreshing of sleeping neurons as a service. I am very curious who will dominate this "industry". If ordinary people do not want to actively participate in the management of NNS, then I understand confirming their activity every so often to receive rewards with the help of their delegate and supporting him with their voting power. However, I would treat deleting any settings of neuron following as interference in their ability to decide for themselves, by systematically pushing them to more convenient, centralized trust services.
It's good that our YouTube channels subscriptions don't disappear. I can't remember all names myself and if they all suddenly disappeared, I'd have trouble finding them and following them again.
I find complete resetting of neurons followees to null to be quite a controversial issue and I myself would not support its implementation as it does not in any way lead to decentralization in the long term.

I agree with you on this point.  To me periodic confirmation should just be about establishing a minimum definition of active participation in governance, not about changing the Followee configuration of the neuron.  People who vote manually or change or confirm their Followees periodically satisfy this minimum expectation in my mind.  If they want to follow DFINITY and they know that their neurons were configured to follow them by default at genesis, then that is their prerogative.  I also think it’s fair to remove the Governance topic from All Topics and for DFINITY to switch their neuron ID if they want, but that is the prerogative of the NNS and DFINITY, respectively.  It’s up to participants to pay attention to those changes and, just as importantly, it’s up to the ICP community and DFINITY to educate and communicate effectively about these changes.  Anyway, I’d prefer that the neuron voting power is suspended when neuron owners don’t comply instead of changing the following.

[/quote]

From what I know, initially the neurons by default tracked neuron 28 (ICA), not 27 (DFINITY). Then the ICA neuron started tracking DFINITY in all possible topics. This was the only choice that was not made arbitrarily by the neuron owners but by the initial foundation configuration. I do not think that anything should be done about it, and an interesting option worth considering for me seems to be the possibility of further development of this association on the way to further decentralization, but off-chain.

Another interesting thing that maybe not many people pay attention to is the fact that both of these neurons are displayed in the NNS Dapp as known, as well as on the ICP Dashboard, while they were never registered in the registry of known neurons in the governance canister. Or at least I do not see them there. One could simply eliminate this ("bug"?) and then register new DFINITY and ICA neurons by submitting an NNS proposal.

Would you please consider explicitly stating the proposal topics that do not fall into the All Topics catch all category in the NNS dApp on the page where Followee selections are made?  I think it is not intuitive which topics need Followee selections vs which are covered by All Topics.  This is needed for both the NNS and SNS projects.  It would even be helpful if the NNS dApp could flag topics that do not have any Followees selected and make it obvious to users that they have gaps in their selections.  Perhaps this would stimulate some of the initial Followee configuration changes.

Another feature that would be user friendly and would stimulate further decentralization is to show a count of proposals for each topic that the neuron has missed voting in the past.  Since the governance canister saves the last 100 ballots for every neuron, this should be an easy statistic to determine every time the user is looking at their neuron configuration.  It could even be presented as a percent loss in voting rewards, especially since Governance and SNS both have a 20x weight compared to all other topics.  As an example, it would highlight that people who follow DFINITY on those topics are losing rewards since DFINITY doesn’t always vote on those topics.   That might help change the momentum of people following DFINITY on those topics.  If you do something like this, then please do not count proposals that are still accepting votes as a negative statistic.  All neurons have the right to vote any time in the voting period of the proposal and should not be presented in a negative light just because they wait until the end to vote.

I agree.  Since DFINITY ran into legal obstacles transferring the ICP tokens to ICA at genesis, I have just considered DFINITY and ICA to be one and the same.  However, you are right and I still hope that ICA will stand up on its own some day as an independent organization as originally intended.  There is so much that an independent ICA organization could be doing for the ICP ecosystem.

DFINITY may not vote at all, and I agree with you that this may cause a decrease in their total voting power. However, let's think more deeply about what the NNS participants will then consider when disappointed by their absence from voting. It is possible that they may go to another, less responsible entity, which will also may cause a noticeable centralization effect. I think that the NNS system itself could detect all active neurons in the NNS, and then assign the appropriate level of saturation using appropriate algorithms. If the tangle of followees was really long, but in reality some neuron would accumulate more than, for example, 5% of the voting power (in the form of distributed voting power), the rewards for neurons that follow a large player could be proportionally reduced. In a way, this would program decentralization by creating economic incentives to improve network decentralization, not economic blockades and threats of wiping your neuron for not logging into your account.

-------------------------

daeitus | 2024-08-22 00:42:38 UTC | #55

we already have a minimum definition of active participation in governance, that is to set a followee. you want to change it to something else. 99%+ of neurons are not genesis. none of this is necessary and it's off-putting to stakers. staking should be as easy and seamless as possible. stop changing the rules

if you just want to shake up the genesis neurons then do a well advertised one-time followee reset and be done with it. no recurring confirmations

-------------------------

SmartMonkey | 2024-08-22 02:24:15 UTC | #56

How about give 100% of the voting rewards to neurons who vote themselves and give 90% of the voting rewards to neurons who vote by following someone. Plus a 3 month inactivity unfollow of the neurons.

-------------------------

SmartMonkey | 2024-08-22 01:40:57 UTC | #57

Also Dfinity voting and having lots of followers is not bad. When they vote they know what they are voting on and they have the best interest of the network. The average ICP voter just clicks buttons to get the reward and cant read code.

I’m not sure if I need to clarify, but I will just in case.  DFiNITY already doesn’t vote on every Governance and SNS proposal.  They have good reason not to vote when they choose not to vote.  They are not obligated to vote on every proposal.  If people know that they don’t vote on every proposal and they are still ok with following DFINITY, then I don’t see any problem with that choice.  My main point was that is is relatively easy to make it obvious to neuron owners if they are missing any voting rewards.  I only used DFINITY as an example of how the numbers would not show 100% voting rewards based on prior recent history.  I also wasn’t trying to suggest that DFINITY should change anything about their voting decision.

[/quote]

I agree this could happen, but then the calculations of participation rate for each neuron would also show a lack of voting by the new Followee choice.  It would also create new opportunities for known neurons to make their case as a reliable Followee choice.  This whole process seems like a useful exercise to get each person to educate themselves and make assessments of who to follow.  Putting performance data in the hands of each neuron owner in the same app for which they set their
Followees could have a powerful impact on decentralization.

Hi Lara, in your original proposal it says this:

[quote="lara, post:1, topic:34215"]
The main idea of periodic confirmation is that in order to get rewards, governance participants have to remain active voters and regularly confirm their following settings.
[/quote]

But it looks like when I brought up that one can easily circumvent this, you say the idea is actually to just target a large proportion of voters - so not all governance particpants.

I don't disagree that it targets a substantial amount of voters right now (long term that might change). But I think the original proposal should be updated then to just say something like "the idea is to target a substantial amount of the voters - not all governance participants". I think that's more honest to NNS participants?

[quote="daeitus, post:25, topic:34215, full:true"]
this sounds like a significant disincentive to staking on the nns versus elsewhere. also pointless complexity as @dfxjesse explained. the original proposal should be be revisited, since it was made over two years ago and opinions have likely changed.
[/quote]

Ye that's the most logical thing to do I think, but I doubt it will happen. To be fair I didn't read through the original proposal over two years ago but I know at the time we didn't have canister-controlled neurons and maybe not even canister timers - so I doubt anyone mentioned that this update can easily be automated if it goes through.

I'm not really in favour either of changing the rules if the new rules are not for everyone and only for those who use UI's.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-23 13:36:34 UTC | #61

This is something that comes up every now and then but is not on our list of immediate priorities on the governance side. 
I think the development of such a solution can also be regarded as separate as it might be useful not only for governance but also other applications.
It would also be a separate very big discussion if this is where we want to go with governance.

This is probably mostly for historical reasons because these neurons were already "hardcoded" on the dashboard before the known neuron feature existed.

lara | 2024-08-23 13:45:46 UTC | #63

OK, so sounds like @wpb and @krzysztofzelazko have a preference to just go for the voting power adjustment and *not* include a full reset of following. Is that right? 
Are there also voices in favor of a full reset at the end of the grace period who can maybe add more pros than the ones already mentioned?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-23 13:50:33 UTC | #64

Thanks for the ideas! 

We plan to have a separate discussion later on how neurons can be incentivised to vote directly. I suggest that we take the discussion of whether neurons should get different reward when they vote directly vs. through following there. It has come up in a few occasions and would fit well there.

Wrt the 3 months of inactivity, as mentioned above, maybe 6 months is a better sweetspot for a user-friendly solution.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-23 13:54:02 UTC | #65

Yes I think that is probably fair and might be clearer.

Just to clarify: I don't currently plan to use this text in a proposal or so. So I thought rather than updating the original post, we could just discuss the design and then gather changes in the messages here, maybe summarizing all changes in a final post.
I would therefore prefer to not edit the original post so that new readers have all the context and we can just take this into account if we write such a "this is what we decided"-post. Hope that makes sense!

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-23 15:49:30 UTC | #66

It feels as though this is being ignored, but I’m curious why nobody has addressed the increased probability of a 51% attack when you start removing voting power from the system?

The grand majority of voting power is followees, under a set & forget model, therefor it’s not unreasonable to expect a substantial percentage of voting power to be “temporarily eliminated” from the NNS - directly inflating the proportional voting power of active participants. 

Why choose to enable this in contrast to just removing followees in alignment with the original design?

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2024-08-23 17:56:13 UTC | #67

My thoughts fwiw:

Tokenomic changes rightly have a high voting threshold because investments are based on trust and stability. At the same time, as @wpb points out, part of investing in the IC is investing in the concept of a NNS which develops over time. So while I'm wary of this change, I also see a purpose for it.

I would push for a conservative solution however due to unknown consequences, such as those that @Accumulating.icp and others bring up. A well-publicized, one time reset might provide valuable data that would inform a better long-term solution.

If the community does proceed with this initiative, I would prefer the solution @lara originally proposed but with a minimum 6/6 (grace/degradation) period for biannual confirmation.

Also, if this isn't already the case, known neurons themselves should be removed after a period of inactivity on their part.

ICPbagholder | 2024-08-27 03:09:52 UTC | #69

As per Microsoft Co-pilot: Estimates suggest that around **6 million BTC** , or approximately **30%** of Bitcoin’s supply, have been irretrievably lost due to forgotten private keys or lost hardware wallet devices.

Probably on a way smaller scale, this happen to ICP as well.  People die, people lost their keys.  How would you manage to stop them from voting while still following, maybe deciding for a critical vote,  while dead, without periodic confirmation?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-27 08:19:37 UTC | #70

Thanks @Accumulating.icp , I think this is a valid point - let's think about this!

I agree that with less overall voting power one could reach the % relevant for decisions.
However, I wonder if it would be easier to reach this % - I think this would depend on how many tokens are in circulation and could be bought by an attacker. I assume that for an attacker it would be hard or impossible to get the sleepers to follow them - so there is a lot of locked tokens which are not "free" to get for an attacker and cannot be used for such an attack.

At the same time for neurons that now have a lot of voting power due to sleepers, it would probably become harder to launch attacks as they have less voting power relative to the decision making, right?

The main problem that I see with this is that it might then be very hard to make decisions for a while after the reset. This could be dangerous in case there are urgent upgrades like security fixes. 
Maybe the graph in my original post helps here: a one-off reset would look similar to "reset of following" on the right and has the same disadvantages.

Here’s a rough calculation to assess the increased risk of a 51% attack:

*   The voting participation rate in topic governance currently stands at 60%.
*   Given the higher impact on rewards and the notifications provided by the NNS app, it seems reasonable to expect that the portion of active neurons (as defined in the proposal) would be higher. A portion of 80%  seems like a plausible assumption.
*   With an 80% participation rate of active neurons, an entity would need to control 40% of the total voting power to achieve a majority (50%) of the active voting power.
*  Accumulating such a significant share of voting power would likely be prohibitively expensive (e.g. acquiring nearly all liquid ICP tokens).

By the end of the year, there is projected to be nearly 100 million of potential ICP in undispersed voting rewards. I think it is reasonable to assume that if a hostile buyer were to drive the price up, a significant amount of these would be converted into liquid ICP, causing:

- Decreased voting power for friendly neurons
- Downward pressure on ICP price
- Increased potential voting power for an attacker 

Also, an 80% participation rate for voting seems speculative to me, in the absence of experimental data.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-27 15:26:40 UTC | #74

It’s quite the assumption to say that people, the majority of which operate under a “set & forget” mindset, will suddenly start increasing voting participation by 20% in light of this implementation. If we’re being honest, you’re more likely to see a 20% drop than increase - the only reason we have 60% participation is due to Named Neurons. 

Utilizing a realistic model of 40% participation, we find ourselves in a situation where DFINITY’s 19.73% of total voting power is once again nearly enough to actuate 50% of the vote (49.32% of active voting power) in contrast to the 32.88% of the participating voting power that is DFINITY currently controlled (that took a lot of selling over the last 3 years to achieve). 

This also only addresses the governance topic - how will this translate in codebase topics? DFINITY already actuates 99.99% of the vote through a forced genesis delegation.

It seems as though we’re ignoring the elephant in the room. 

A 51% is achieved within 6 months implementation of your Periodic Followee Design - although we’ll probably act like it’s not a big deal because “it’s just us, why don’t you trust us”, right…?

I’m not worried about the big bad wolf that’s been pitched to us for years now - I’m curious about what’s going on in-house.

Could this be addressed by allowing neurons to preemptively confirm their configuration prior to the date of reset (e.g. during the 3 or 6 month period spent advertising it)?

-------------------------

EpicICP | 2024-08-28 12:13:32 UTC | #76

My biggest concern is that this only introduces negative feedback mechanisms. If you don't participate, you don't get your rewards. That seems fair, but if I confirm my followers and do nothing else, I still get rewarded even though I am contributing nothing meaningful to the process.

What we need are positive feedback mechanisms, which incentivize people to participate deeply and meaningfully in a small number of topics (not all topics, since that would be too time consuming for any one person).

I believe that a smaller group of highly qualified voters is preferable to a large number of confirmation bot voters. This means changing the incentive structure to encourage some direct voting, some vote delegation and confirmation, and higher rewards for those who actively participate!

I believe we need to revisit the idea of allowing active participants to receive greater rewards for participating in neglected topics. If you are active and willing to learn the nuances of a boring or unpopular topic, then you should be rewarded at a higher rate. This could afford those who make the NNS better for everyone the opportunity to build a larger stake.

Sorry for pointing the elephant in the room but..

Have everyone considered that giving voting power to 0 to some account ( and still give them rewards ) would transform the protocol into a security ?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 11:39:56 UTC | #78

I think I missed answering this before.
Let's maybe discuss the details in the context of other design discussions, but I just wanted to say that we agree with this and there are already 2 planned frontend features that I think go in exactly the direction you are mentioning:
1. Following should be made easier. This should include that it is easily visible which topic are included in the catch-all (and for SNSs which topics are critical).
2. The dapp could show a form of warning for neurons that are (potentially) missing out on rewards. The initial idea (but we haven't started designing this in more detail) is to show this in the neurons' table. This could inclue when a neuron as adjusted voting power, when a neuron hasn't voted on all of the past 100 proposals, or when a neuron doesn't have following set up. 

We can then define the details within these features, but thought it might help to know that this is on our radar

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 12:05:35 UTC | #79

I think it is reasonable to assume that a large portion of the sleeper neurons are really inactive, also over such a pre-warning period of 3 months.
This would then still mean that their full voting power would fall away as a "cliff" on one day - making it very hard for the rest of the NNS to react if there is an emergency situation exactly on that day or shortly after.
It is then also the question whether enough would confirm to ever get back to 50% (which is maybe likely but might take a longer period of time.)

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 12:09:11 UTC | #80


>I believe we need to revisit the idea of allowing active participants to receive greater rewards for participating in neglected topics.

Yes, we agree that it also makes sense to look into how neurons can be incentivised to do more active verification work.
We just launched grants for this as an intermediate solution and plan to work on a design to build this into the NNS later. 
We can basically tackle this from both angles.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 12:11:09 UTC | #81

I wonder if we are now mixing up a few different cases here, considering direct voting power and indirect voting power that also takes into account followers as well as scenarios from outsiders vs neurons that already have a lot of followers today. 

First, there is the case of an external attacker who does not yet have any followers. To get to 51% of the voting power, they would either have to convince a lot of people to change following and follow them or they would have to get 51% direct voting power. 
Starting from zero, it is probably unlikely that an outsider could convince enough people to get 51% follower voting power. But even if they achieve this, then this is justified voting power in the current governance model.
The alternative is for such a person to stake enough tokens to have 51% of the direct voting power. In this case, Bjoern’s analysis applies. Even if the number of voting participation would be at 60% similar to the current governance participation, since no such party currently has a high voting power, it would be very expensive to get so many liquid tokens from the market.

Second, there is the case of neurons that already have a lot of followers, like for example DFINITY. 
Especially for the case of DFINITY this feature would surely be advantageous and help to decrease the voting power that DFINITY has as a large portion of the following from sleepers would fall away.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2024-08-29 12:38:01 UTC | #82

I'm wondering about the voting power that the nueron induces. What happens to its induced voting power when a sleeper neurons starts to lose voting power? So what will happen to DFINITY's true total voting power from followers once this change is implemented? Will it go down?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-29 13:05:38 UTC | #83

This feels like intentional ignorance at this point😅 I’m going to ignore the wall of doomsday 51% attacker scenarios, that DFINITY has so religiously referenced at convenience (for Neuron Marketplaces, its a problem, yet suddenly, it’s a non issue in this regard. Seems like it’s just a narrative to be used when something has to be pushed through or rejected). 

DFINITYs voting power may be reduced through followees being stripped of their voting power, but you’re ignoring the fact that as you take away voting power from quorum, you actually only make the 20% that DFINITY owns stronger, as has been depicted. 

This is certainly “advantageous to DFINITY” as you’ve mentioned, as this function will directly increase the % of quorum DFINITY controls. 

If you wanted to decentralize it, remove the followee & leave people with their voting power contributing to quorum.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 13:35:26 UTC | #84

So if the *followers* get adjusted voting power, then the overall induced voting power of the voting neuron will go down.
Let's consider a simple example with 3 neurons N1, N2, and N3 that each have a voting power of 10. Let's assume N2 is a sleeper neuron that follows N1.
* Now
   * Direct voting power is: N1 = 10, N2 =10, N3=10.
   * Induced voting power (including following): N1=20, N3=10
   * Total voting power for decisions = 30
   * => N1 influences the decision with 2/3 of the voting power
* With the new feature, after a while N2's voting power would be adjusted to zero and the total voting power would be adjusted accordingly, so:
   * Adjusted voting power is: N1 = 10, N2 = 0, N3 = 10.
   * Induced voting power (including following): N1 = 10, N3 = 10
   * Total voting power for decisions = 20
   * => N1 influences the decision with 1/2 of the voting power

Let me know if I made a mistake!

Then there is the case where the *followee* has adjusted voting power.
If this followee is a known neuron that should vote directly (but is now inactive), then all the followees would not get rewards and the induced voting power is zero. Hopefully since they don't get rewards the followers would switch to follow others.

It gets a bit more interesting if there is a longer chain of following. In that case, if the neuron at the top of the chain votes, then votes would still be triggered for everyone who follows a follower, and it would depend on each follower and their activity whether the adjustment is applied or not. 

Does this help or were you looking for something else?

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 13:41:38 UTC | #85

Maybe we can consider the example below that I made and you can let me know if I had an oversight? 

Indeed, the direct voting power (in relation to the total voting power relevant for decisions) of neuron N1 would increase (it was 1/3 and goes to 1/2), but the *induced* voting power would still go down (from 2/3 to 1/2). Do you agree with this?

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-29 13:49:57 UTC | #86

Respectfully, I understand how the function works, but the scenario you’ve crafted in which a neuron loses voting power has no correlation to addressing what I’ve depicted.

I would appreciate if we could stay on conversation rather than attempting to introduce me as a fact checker for something else you’ve said.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2024-08-29 14:01:11 UTC | #87

Yes this helps a lot.

Just to be extra clear and sure, we can expect a drop in DFINITY induced voting power after implementing this change assuming there is a material number of sleeper neurons? Because the idea put forth by various community members for a long time has been that there are many sleeper neurons here from genesis that were set to follow DFINITY neurons by default?

Oh...but...the percentage of voting power will not necessarily go down, and might even go up?

Okay that's the concerning part.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 14:06:54 UTC | #88

Yes I think your understanding is correct then. 

We could then depict both the voting power in terms of adjusted and potential voting power, e.g., on the dashboard, to make this clearer.

This is the concerning part. I think focusing on voting percentage is the more material metric, as it's this percentage that wields actual decision-making power.

Like monetary supply and inflation, the actual number of dollars for example matters a bit less when the supply is materially changing.

Hmmm...I need to think about it more.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2024-08-29 14:10:43 UTC | #90

But if this percentage accurately represents current voting power based on ICP staked in neurons and those actively participating, then perhaps this makes sense.

A key question seems to be: should sleeper voting power be completely removed from the total voting power calculations for determining quorums etc?

How many truly “actively participate”? It’s a threshold we’ve applied in retrospect & continuously change.

Is following a named neuron honestly active participation..?

If thats the goal to be achieved, perhaps we can cut back a few hundred million voting power & just leave it to the select few decision makers😅

I would appreciate if you would stop using condescending language.  There is no need to show disrespect to people who are willing to engage with you on the forum.  @lara is clearly trying to engage with you in a mutually respectful and professional manner.  You would be so much more effective with your arguments if you would leave out the ad hominem.  Nobody cares for it.  Stay focused on the topic of discussion.

>But if this percentage accurately represents current voting power based on ICP staked in neurons and those actively participating, then perhaps this makes sense.

I think so too. I think it is actually useful to have both numbers - the overall and relative voting power of a neuron compared to if everyone were active as well as their influence with the current activity. 

>A key question seems to be: should sleeper voting power be completely removed from the total voting power calculations for determining quorums etc?

Yes correct. And one main argument why the design proposed to answer this with yes is to be able to make quick decisions.
I also think however it makes sense on a conceptual level to agree on quorums that make sense compared to who is actually participating.


>How many truly “actively participate”? It’s a threshold we’ve applied in retrospect & continuously change.

Right, this is something that we are newly deciding with this design.

-------------------------

lara | 2024-08-29 17:01:34 UTC | #95

I think this is actually not very different from today in the sense that if the neuron you follow doesn't vote you also don't vote.. 
But yes, there is the new case where such a neuron could also have adjusted voting power :)

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-29 17:29:28 UTC | #96

I’m not sure why you’re playing victim - it’s a recurring tactic you use, and honestly, it’s a bit old. 

It says a lot if you think people are condescending for asking that we stay on topic rather than attempt to divert it & avoid the conversation. 

I’m sure you’ll flag this for off topic, but surely you can appreciate the comedy in you running to the rescue when real questions are asked.

@lara, is it correct that the VP of DFINITY would increase from 19% to 32% after this proposal? And possible more? 

If so, why would we adopt it if the idea was to improve decentralization?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2024-08-29 19:17:51 UTC | #98

I think we need to come up with checks and balances that embrace decentralization while still allowing decisions to be made quickly.

Right now to make decisions quickly we have allowed one entity to gain complete write control to the protocol.

-------------------------

Accumulating.icp | 2024-08-29 19:46:19 UTC | #99

There is a slight misunderstanding here so I just want to help fill in;

19% of voting power represents what DFINITY currently owns, and 32% represents the portion of voting power they own in contrast to current active voting power (governance topic yields about 60% participation).

We can use this participation rate to estimate a minimum amount of voting power being stripped from the system upon failing vote confirmation after 6 months of this system being implemented (the inactive 40%, as they’re already losing rewards & haven’t changed anything).

This leaves us in a situation where 60% of the current total voting power becomes 100% of quorum - leading to a default control of 32% of voting power by DFINITY’s neurons with their current 19% of total voting power (not considering followees).

Yeah, that's what I meant by increasing the VP to 32%. Thanks for the clarification.

I think that's the VP that matters most since it doesn't depend on active delegations that can be switched in case of an "attack".

so you don’t want to do a one-time reset because it would initially prevent 51% of the total voting power being used, for quick emergency decisions? then divide the total voting neurons into a few equal chunks, to be reset sequentially over a designated time period. chunk A, B, C, D, whatever. then the impact would be softened. problem solved right? do a poll on X, “do you want to have to log in and press a button in the nns every 5 months for no reason, or else you lose your voting rewards?” the answer will be no.

-------------------------

>Right now to make decisions quickly we have allowed one entity to gain complete write control to the protocol.

I am not sure I agree with the fact that this needs to be one entity. 
After the introduction of voting grants, I hope that the following on critical proposals, such as IC OS election or protocol canister management, will spread over more known neurons.
If these known neurons can still be set up to react quickly, the trust is more spread but there is no need for one party.

Indeed it is a good question how this would work if we have hundreds of known neurons that can be followed. This will be a nice problem to have, but I think we are not there yet so this is something we can optimize for a bit later.
