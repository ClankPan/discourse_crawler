I learn the concepts of Dfinity. I'm interesting at [Orthogonal persistence](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html#_orthogonal_persistence), I don't understand why called it as **Orthogonal**. 

"[Orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality)" means 
> avoid deleterious superfluities;
> avoid redundancy

Is that to say Internet Computer will keep the number of same data's replica within a reasonable range to avoid too many redundancy?

It has nothing to do with redundancy. It just means that you do not need to worry about setting up a database or explicitly save the state. It is done for you automatically.
