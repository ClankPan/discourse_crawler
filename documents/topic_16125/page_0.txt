# Problem Statement
Recent discussions about NNS treasury, APY changes, network expansion and storage costs had me thinking about the current tokenomics and whether the IC has potential to become deflationary at some point in the future. 

*Why do I think deflation is an important aspect to consider?* 
It's safe to assume a majority of ICP holders and stakers invested in the project not only cause they believe in the idea of a decentralized internet but mainly for monetary gain, the IC's security model and liveness are also based on the assumption the token has at the very least a stable or slightly bullish price action, if that weren't the case:
- the NNS would break cause the stakers' locked value depreciates no matter what, so stakers are no longer incentivized to act in the network's best long term interest but to extract as much value as possible in the short term.
- A depreciating and inflationary token would benefit late adopters in the NNS, who will be able to buy *Voting Power* at a cheaper prices.
- A sustained downward trend would lead the ICP in a death spiral due to how node rewards are minted, if such a scenario were to happen the network might not be sustainable anymore.

The ICP has 2 types of inflation: **Governance rewards** and **Node rewards**, so let's see how they work and whether it's possible to eventually achieve deflation.


### Governance Rewards
Governance rewards are calculated by a % based on a descending curve applied on total supply.
For simplicity's sake I've considered the "best case scenario" (no node rewards, low price, inflation at end of curve(5%) calculated on genesis supply, not current or future), that'd be:
20.000.000 ICP yearly inflation (400 mil at genesis @ 5% APY)
1 ICP = 4$ = 4,8 XDR
1XDR = 1T Cycles

If ICP price were 4$ that's 96.000.000 XDR worth of cycles to be burned yearly to counter governance inflation or **96.000.000T cycles/y**, in the last 7 days 30.000.000.000 cycle/s was the top according to the dashboard, so **933.120T cycles/y** (30.000.000.000 x 60(m) x 60(h) x 24(d) x 30(M) x 12(y))


Even in this optimistic scenario burn rate should more than 100x to counter inflation, it gets even worse as price increases, cause number of tokens minted stays the same but amount of ICP burnt per XDR is reduced. So is deflation possible?
Well it depends on how much of the current total network capacity (or ***CTNC***) 30 bil cycles/s is: 1%, 2%, 50%? I honestly don't know, BUT unless it were a considerably high percentage, e.g 90%, there might still be hope cause the % is based on the **current** capacity, so while we can't use more than 100% of it, the IC itself can become bigger by adding more subnets and by doing so increase the max theoretical cycle burn rate.


### Node Rewards

More subnets equal more nodes, which result in more minted tokens to pay providers, it is therefore fundamental to figure out the factor by which cycle burn increases as the network grows. Deflation is only possible if:
1) Subnet avg. cycle burn  / (1T * XDR/ICP *avg*.) > Subnet rewards
2) Subnet's burn surplus (difference between avg. cycle burn and subnet rewards) * *n of subnets* (n being a realistic number) >= *Issuance*

The providers' rewards vary based on country and in future based on specs too, for simplicity’s sake let’s assume all nodes are paid the lowest rate: 873 XDR/month, a subnet has 13 nodes in it atm, that's 136.188 XDR/y worth of ICP per subnet or 4.766.580 XDR for the entire network (136.188*XDR* x 35 *subnets*) or 4.766.580T cycles/y. 

Taking into account the registered spike of 933.120T cycles/y we find out the **cycle burn rate must 5x just to offset the node rewards minting**, I'm not sure whether that is doable, it depends on how much of the *CTNC* 933.120T cycles/y is, if the percentage is too high and a 5x isn't possible, e.g > 20%, then increasing node count will only make things worse cause even if the network were used at 100% 24/7, it still wouldn't be enough to burn more tokens than minted to pay for the subnets. 
In such a scenario the only way to make deflation possible would be to increase cycles cost per operation without penalizing devs to harshly, as that might cause cycle burn rate to drop.

I'll assume the 5x is possible because it's coincidentally pretty close to the same estimate @Kyle_Langham gave a while ago and I trust in his verdict, still more analysis should be done to figure out the cycle burn to mint ratio per subnet with realistic usage metrics, keeping that ratio higher than 1 and as high as possible without impacting operational costs for devs is crucial to the network's profitability.
I'd also like to mention a scenario related to how storage costs are currently calculated which might heavily impact cycle burn to mint ratio per subnet for the worse, for brevity's sake here is a link: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-regarding-re-exc-1168-add-non-subsidised-storage-cost-on-20-node-subnets-behind-the-flag/15420/17

Mind you NNS inflation is fixed regardless of token price, but ICP burnt per XDR decreases as token price goes up, therefore even if the IC burnt more than it minted for node rewards, the network's usage and capacity will have to increase alongside price to offset the governance rewards and keep deflation going. 
I foresee even with a good cycle burn to mint ratio per subnet this is what might happen:
- More tokens are burnt than minted  -> price increases
- Price increases -> less tokens are burnt
- Network growth can't keep up with price growth -> More tokens are minted than burnt -> Price decreases
- ICP price stays at range in which total supply doesn't significantly increase or decrease.

It'd be interesting to do forecasts and figure out where that balance could be reached with different outcomes, e.g if IC were as big as AWS and cycle burn to mint ratio per subnet were x.

### Staking Deflation

Staking is considered by some as a form of deflation and while it might look like it, especially if the tokens are staked for 8 years, this conviction might prove fatal in the long term, here is why:

*Governance Rewards* are based on a curve, which will eventually plateau at 5% in a few years: 5% of **total** supply.

In a rational market token price will increase if: 
1) Cycle burn rate > Node rewards mint rate

2) Total cycle burnt yearly / (1T * XDR/ICP *avg*.) >= *Issuance* (ICP tokens added to the circulating supply, *max* is 5% of total supply, *min* is 0)

Max *Issuance*: if both 1 and 2 are true, NNS driven inflation decreases as supply shrinks and scarcity increases irreversibly.
Min or low *Issuance*: if both 1 and 2 are true due to low issuance caused by locked tokens, the scarcity increases on paper as long as they remain in the NNS, inflation increases due to total supply growing every year and the price might still increase due to the "temporary" scarcity, but eventually investors will want to cash out that value and the newly dissolved tokens flooding the market combined with the increased baseline inflation could cause major dumps and start a chain reaction. 

It would then be preferable if as many tokens tokens were burnt and total supply shrank rather than having too many tokens locked and an increasing total supply.


# Conclusion

Despite calculating metrics using the best case variables for deflation's sake, the results aren't promising, so unless I'm missing something or have committed mistakes along the way, we might have a problem on our hands.
I truly believe this is a very important topic that needs to be discussed as it entails many aspects of the IC's future: network's profitability and security, investors' and stakers' financial prospects, operational costs for devs. 
I hope to have conveyed my thoughts clearly, if there is something you haven't understood or I got wrong, feel free to tell me, I'm looking forward to hear what the community has to say.

Thanks for reading :D

I share three articles by Kyle, one that analyzes the long-term model and the other the current statistics that I don't know if you used to make the calculations..

Another thing I noticed is that you only calculated the conversion burn from ICP to Cyclos, but you didn't calculate the transaction burn.

FranHefner | 2022-10-24 20:18:22 UTC | #4

One thing to note is that when DEFI in IC is 100% developed, they will have to lock tokens to have capital backing. While this does not affect inflation, it does affect the price of the token. In addition, hundreds of thousands of transactions are generated that also contribute to burning and the latter does impact inflation.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-24 20:36:12 UTC | #5

I'm aware of those estimates but I didn't take them into consideration for my analysis. 
I don't quite agree with Kyle's conclusion:
>There exists a technical hardware limit to the amount of cycles a node can can burn in a given time. A while back I calculated that technical limit to be between 7500 XDR and 12500 XDR per month

> If we assume that an average node on the IC burns 4000 XDR worth of ICP a month in 2030 (using 12000 XDR as the technical limit and the IC executing at 33% of capacity) and costs 750 XDR a month, then the Op would be 3250 XDR in 2030.

1) It's dangerous to assume XDR per node will be lower than the lowest rate being paid now, inflation, hardware cost increase (Gen2 HW is already more expesive than Gen1) might influence providers rewards for the worse.
2) Even ignoring the optimistic assumption, profitability has to be calculated per *subnet* not per *node*, 750 XDR * 13 (avg. node count) = 9750XDR/subnet/month, even if we use the max burn rate he calculated that's only 2250XDR/subnet/month, so how many subnets are needed to burn 5% of total supply? Say 20 mil ICPs? Depends on the price, at 4XDR, which I doubt is the price we'd like the token to settle on, that'd be: 80 mil XDR / 27000 = ~2.962 subnets. That's a LOT!

And even then there is still the potential of entire subnets being used only for storage and burning almost no cycles as described in the post I've linked.

>Another thing I noticed is that you only calculated the conversion burn from ICP to Cycles, but you didn’t calculate the transaction burn.

TX driven burn is quite low, 0.0001 ICP per TX, so you'd need billions of TXs to make the difference. The IC is also a decentralized cloud more than a blockchain, so many dApps might not even generate IC TXs, burn rate is a much more reliable metric, most TXs I assume will be from custom tokens and those burn cycles based on the operations used by the canister's methods.

I disagree with you, the growth potential is incalculable.
Transactions can be infinitely larger.

We are not only talking about transfers in terms of value, but also in terms of the action of an app or game.

I give you an example within a game:

An MMORPG game (like WOW) where every time a person kills an npc, a token transfer is made to the player. Or in a p2p every time you die or kill someone a transfer is made, that would generate incalculable transfers.

An example of a chess that every time a piece is eaten a transfer is made and also to win..

An example of a sale of a business that every time it sells or someone consumes something, a transfer is made.

An app like spotify that each song you listen to generates a transfer..

Do you understand the dimension of what we are talking about?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-24 21:51:18 UTC | #9

Yeah and most of those TXs wouldn't be ICP transfers in a majority of cases but ledger operations whose cycle cost is defined here and is much cheaper than 0.001 ICP: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/deploy/computation-and-storage-costs. 

The growth potential might be incalculable but ultimately it doesn't matter if subnets can't realistically burn more than they mint, TPS per subnet is finite so even if you don't want to believe my findings, Kyle too estimates about 12500 XDR per month max theoretical burn per subnet with a 9750XDR cost to run it, the surplus which would be subtracted from governance rewards is quite small.

-------------------------

FranHefner | 2022-10-24 22:07:56 UTC | #10

I understand where you are pointing. Just a serious question, what do you care if it is inflationary or not, what matters to you is the price. All the countries of the world are inflationary (with a small inflation to grow) and that does not generate a problem. 

The problem is that you see a relationship between price and inflation. The higher the inflation, the more likely the price will go down, I know. But the price is supply and demand. That is where the amount of circulating supply comes in and the staking that exists day by day, on the other hand, if the defi advances, you also have less liquid supply, which will affect the price. If inflation is 5% and they give you 15% for staking, does that 5% really matter or do you care about the difference with what they give you?

Tell me if I'm wrong, but 99.99% of people worry about inflation, it's about price. And the price is supply and demand, it's another discussion.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2022-10-25 14:47:53 UTC | #11

An interesting tokenomic hypothesis about inflation deflation and price, and it is indeed quite contrary to most people's mindset. Your hypothesis need to be validated for further sustainability analysis.

What I see is, ICP tokenomics has some part similarity with Modern Monetary Theory that gaining popularity nowadays. I am curious if the designer of ICP tokenomics (Anybody know who?) maybe inspired by it.

This experimental monetary policy is considered controversial due to its ability to inflate currency as much as they wish to stimulate and grow the economy, just like ICP protocol can mint token as much as it want to achieve its objectives. Some said it solves funding problem, some said it is a receipt for future disaster. And I believe not all  ICP stakeholders are comfortable with MMT style tokenomics

I agree with you that ICP growth potential is incalculable right now, and maybe this is the reason of why all token inflation metrics is set by dfinity at the super-optimistic scenario, because the future growth is super huge.

But, will it be wiser if the token mechanic is set at more at realistic best case scenario ?  An adaptive tokenomics that can adapt & adjust with market condition, especially in a bear market.

When you refer to countries I assume you mean fiat money, if that's the case it is a different topic entirely, money are a medium of exchange, they are not supposed to store value for a long amount of time, the comparison would be appropriate if the IC token were only used to be converted in cycles, but that isn't the only use and as explained if the price isn't at least stable the network will suffer in the long run.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough with the *Staking Deflation* paragraph, it is my opinion relying on lockups to counter an otherwise impossible to overcome inflation is a slippery slope. 
We agree price is based on supply and demand, if the supply is regulated by burning tokens, the price shall reflect the day to day ratio between the 2 variables and since *Issuance* is predictable, the main variable to observe is utility, therefore the supply/demand ratio should oscillate gracefully based on network usage.

If the supply is regulated by any form of locking, the above is only half true because *Issuance* is no longer procedurally predictable by looking at a formula but it is influenced by human behaviour, so if to achieve deflation the IC must rely heavily on stakers both staking tokens in the NNS and compounding their rewards, price will go up but only as long as NNS inflows outpace outflows, which as time goes on become less and less likely as:
1) Stakers will reap their long awaited rewards by either dissolving neurons or selling maturity.
2) Total supply increases every year as maturity gets compounded, so even if the inflation rate flattens at 5%, minted tokens increase due to total supply growing yearly and stakers have to compound an higher % of their rewards to keep deflation going.

In a matter of days the circulating supply could increase at any time by a substantial margin, imagine the impact on price, which has been inflated by an artificially lowered supply, when those tokens get in circulation, all it takes is a whale cashing out and a chain reaction might start:
supply increases -> price dumps, stakers get scared and decide to sell -> supply increases, rinse and repeat.
The only way this won't happen is if staker's never sell more than the market can take before supply/deman ratio are affected, which is wishful thinking at best. 

Locking for 8 years might seem like a lifetime and akin to permanently burning the tokens but remember we are trying to build the internet of tomorrow, so the timespan to consider is decades. Plus no other chain uses DeFi and staking as deflationary mechanisms, otherwise ETH would have been considered deflationary years ago.

[/quote]

Rewards are based on the ratio between your own neurons' voting power and the total VP, as more tokens are staked they get lower, eventually you might be able to counter your holdings dilution by staking for 8 years, but not everyone wants to do that nor it should be necessary.

[quote="FranHefner, post:10, topic:16125"]

[/quote]
Inflation affects supply and if a commodity can be generated faster than it can be depleted than there is no reason for its price to go up, except speculation, but while that might help price in the medium term, if crypto and the IC are here to stay eventually they will be valued based on true utility.

Heihachi | 2022-10-26 09:37:50 UTC | #13

To have more accurate numbers you must find out how many cycles does an IC dapp need per year.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-26 11:20:03 UTC | #14

That isn't the metric we should figure out, but how many cycles per month/year a subnet can consume, which I suppose is based on single subnet's tps. 
How much a dApp needs on average is almost irrelevant cause a subnet can run many dApps simultaneously, the more dApps can run on a single subnet the higher the cycle burn to mint ratio is and the less subnets are needed to scale the network, which further reduces token minting.

It'd be nice if Dfinity could provide us some numbers and clarify how much we can expect them to increase as the protocol gets more efficient.

deflationary

[/quote]

While I don't have the ability to understand most of what you are stating I fully support your questions and explain in layman terms what I mean.

The IC is built around creating a network and needs funding, ICP staking provides this, needs projects built on the IC, needs infrastructure and tries to balance to make all involved to be happy.

The balance, overtime is not in the favor of neuron holders and while we are locked in for 8 or 16 years depending how you look at it our rewards will dwindle while infrastructure and projects grow.

You can not make everyone happy and neuron holders are the sacrificial lamb. The whole design of the IC model, you call inflation and deflation, I call stagflation.

The apps that are being built on the IC, wallet, web hosting, luxury goods, social, chat, bank, market place, games, social, calculator … nothing new or impressing me and they are competing with organizations that have been around for decades with much more experience and resources.

I think the project is great but I always thought the best I can do with investing in this project as a neuron holder will be the first 4 years, by then the rewards will be less than I will receive in other investments but still locked in for many years.

I will at this time be locked without dissolving for the first 4 years and will hold onto my maturity where I will spawn to take my rewards from the IC altogether and hope the price will be above what I paid per icp which at this time is very much lower.

I don’t believe Dfinity wants the price of an ICP to increase, unlike other coins.

I am hoping that Dfinity will see that in the future many Neuron holders have done the same and take action to entice us back to investing into the IC.

Only having the current projects on the IC and future smart contracts with BTC and ETH, well in my opinion, who isn’t.

I believe like many organizations, Dfinity will find that they will have to provide other services to survive and make the only decision in my opinion and that is to use the NNS to provide the security that the Internet needs right now and will need even more on the broken system that we have today.

Why not entice big tech organizations to build on the IC, top 100 companies not related to crypto.

It’s costing billions in fines being on WEB2-3 for many of the top companies, do we not have the infrastructure to support and allow them to do business on the IC without them losing personal data of their customers to spammers.

Why is the IC just another web full of anything goes, when we could be just a RETAIL network and separated from the current public nonsense.

The username and password system will be removed on the IC and will be used to login to all your services.

What if everyone on the IC had to buy a ICP, add funds and paid their RETAIL bills and services through the NNS.

I have been following this forum discussion in detail trying to understand the reverse engineering rational of all participants. It is surprising that we, as a community, are still trying to figure out the the design principles of the Internet Computer Tokenomics strategy. Are we meant, by its design, to continuously inflate or to progressively deflate or perhaps, the design principles were meant to have a periodic inflation/deflation behavior. Whatever are these design principles and the way these principles were engineered into concrete decisions is not known. So, instead of trying to reverse engineer these latent design principles and the implementation methods, could Dfinity (@diegop) expose them clearly?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-30 21:03:20 UTC | #19

From what I've read/heard I've come to the conclusion Dfinity or specifically Dom considers 8 year staking as deflation and relies a lot on it to keep the supply in check. For the reasons stated in my analysis I don't agree with that conclusion.

-------------------------

ildefons | 2022-10-30 21:11:51 UTC | #20

While it seems we have many accountants here showing many formulas, the answer seems to be the same.

ICP growth potential is incalculable.

Let's take a Psychology look at the ICP Model in my opinion.

The ICP isn’t a coin for transactions but to purchase cycles on the IC or to conduct token connections.

Investing or transferring Government fiat currencies to a coin like BTC can, has shown and predicted to double or triple in price, lucky those who bought early.

ICP is not modeled on Government currencies or BTC but for the use on the IC network for usage.

My view on the rewards system on the NNS.

I have locked my neuron for 8 years but when I start to dissolve it is most likely my children will receive and enjoy the neuron worth as it didn’t cost them anything and if I am not a dead person by the time the neuron dissolves I will not enjoy the returned ICP as I paid over $30.

I could get back my investment by the Maturity rewards and I have not spawn these as yet but I consider that I would be better off spawning and then return these to my Coin Provider for a better chance of increasing my investment returns.

For some reason I get the feeling that it is a dirty sentence to say I am here to invest for my returns to go to the moon, it’s not but I can’t see that happening just yet or ever.

I understand that this is in the early cycle of development and anything could happen from a bust or boom but like Zane said, I am here for the project and would like to see the success for a better internet.

I have many more ICP in a non Neuron account and will ride the highs of the ICP price which I can’t do with my locked Neuron.

I don’t believe that the price will ever be going to the moon unless the model changes and I could reverse my decisions and investment on the NNS but I am not seeing anything worthwhile yet.

I am hoping that while most believe that unknown persons and new project ideas are the way to build the IC are in my opinion expensive and costly to the NNS with many reasons why it will not go to the moon when we have a end of cycle aging internet that has big pockets and teams that could and looking for the future internet that I thought was the IC was but is rejecting their business as poison but could burn many cycles, quickly.

Inflation is easy for me as it’s just the balance of cost and return but unlike buying a Property, 8 years ago, inflation will offset the return on the cost and I could increase that return with leasing there isn’t any such foreseeable return on investment on the NNS model as it is all about risk, chance and making enemies.

Clearly having this discussion and seeing “growth potential is incalculable” and that nothing inspirational or foreseeable then we need to look at why this is the case.

:fire: Cycle Burn Rate :fire: ->  ICP

Note: This burn is for cycles only, it does not include additional burns per transaction. Does anyone have an idea if this calculation is close enough to reality? A monthly accumulated would be missing, it would be great !

Sabr | 2022-12-05 23:50:06 UTC | #26

Unless I've calculated something incorrectly, I think the minutes per ICP burned is worse than that now. Per the IC dashboard, the cycles/ICP conversion rate (the graph is incorrectly labeled "ICP/Cycles") = roughly 3.3 trillion, and the current cycle burn rate is roughly (to be generous) 10 billion cycles/second. So 3,300,000,000,000 / 10,000,000,000 = 330 seconds to burn 1 ICP = 5.5 minutes. There are 365 X 24 X 60 X 60 = 31,536,000 seconds/yr., so that means 31.56M seconds / 330 seconds = roughly 95,500 ICP burned per year at this rate. Obviously this is very low compared to the inflation rate of tens of millions of ICP/yr.  However, the bulk of ICP value will come from ICP burning by the SNS ecosystem, which hasn't even begun yet (beyond the SNS-1 beta test).

One can look at deflation (burning) of ICP as being roughly equivalent to revenue, and inflation as being roughly equivalent to cost. To get your head around that comparison to traditional companies, think of Google tokenizing their shares and charging customers GOOG tokens to generate revenue (deflation) and paying all their costs in GOOG tokens (inflation).

However, in my view, staking of ICP can effectively offset all inflation while still leaving enough annual return to compensate for the illiquidity of staking and the opportunity cost of the investment. Therefore, one could also view deflation as the rough equivalent to net income, not just revenue, at least in an ICP staking scenario with a maximum dissolve delay. (I'm implicitly including node reward inflation in this offset too, which should become a progressively smaller portion of deflation as cycles burned / second grows.)

So if we round up the burn rate to 100,000 ICP/yr., the total ICP outstanding to 500 million tokens, and the ICP price to $4.40 as of today, that creates an implied P/E ratio of $4.40 / (100K X $4.40 / 500M) = $4.40 / $0.00088 = 5,000. A typical S&P 500 company's P/E ratio would be about 20, so one could argue that there is still a LOT of potential downside to the ICP price if growth in the IC ecosystem is any slower than explosive over the next several years. 

Even at the "depressed" price of just over $4.00 for ICP, this still implies a very high current market cap of over $2 billion. That double-unicorn valuation is quite rich for what effectively amounts to (almost) a pre-revenue start-up company (given how SNS cycle burns arguably represent the true "revenue launch" of the IC ecosystem, and the SNS ecosystem is only now in the process of being launched).

To get to a hypothetical P/E = 20, the cycle burn rate would have to increase 250X from $10 billion cycles/second to 5,000 / 20 * 10 billion = 2.5 trillion cycles / second, which is not very far off from 1 ICP / second. That is obviously a very long way to go from today's burn rate, and it also assumes that the ICP price never goes up during this growth period, which obviously wouldn't happen.

Now let's assume we are hoping for a "moon price" of $175/ICP sometime in our longer term investment horizon after an explosive growth period, which would be roughly 40X the current price. Over 10 years or so, this is a reasonable valuation expectation given the very high risk of this investment. Since cycles are fixed based on fiat currency prices, not ICP prices, that means the burn rate would not have to just increase 250X to get to a P/E of 20 at this higher ICP price, but by 250 X 40 = 10,000X = 100 trillion cycles / second (excluding fiat currency inflation), as compared to the current 10 billion cycles / second. Again, this implies a massive amount of required growth to get to a price level of roughly $175/ICP when growth is assumed to become more stable. Is this possible? Sure. But, once again, we are a **very** long way off from that level at the current cycles/ICP conversion rate of roughly 3.3 trillion.

If someone could check my calculations, then I would appreciate it. I will update this post for any necessary corrections.

Which is why i don't understand why we don’t charge premium for premium features of IC...such as Bitcoin Integration.  I understand the argument against it...we need to attract devs...but i think there's a balance.

I haven't analyzed the new BTC integration pricing yet. However, I would tend to agree with you if ICP's transaction price for ckBTC transactions is far below other wrapped BTC tokens like WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain. Where I think a more significant premium could be charged is on ICP's price for their native BTC integration, since the added security of this integration is surely worth something. 

In general, I see ICP's high performance ckBTC wrapped integration used more on lower cost transactions (e.g., buying a coffee, where you can't wait 10 minutes at the cash register while the BTC blockchain finalizes your native transaction). A fixed low fee per transaction there makes sense. 

By contrast, I see ICP's native BTC integration used more for high-risk, high-dollar value transactions, where extra security is more valued and no other blockchain or bridge can match the native integration of ICP. ICP pricing for this integration should be based on a % of the BTC transferred to extract the maximum insurance premium from each high-value BTC transaction.

I am not 100% certain that I understand the full difference between ICP's two different BTC integrations, so perhaps my logic is a bit off here.

According to the current token economics, deflation will never happen. Anyone who thinks that ICP will achieve deflation is a miscalculation that is divorced from reality. I once predicted on reddit that the ICP price would fall below $30 (bull market) when the ICP price was $300, and predicted that the ICP price would fall to $3 in a bear market. And give the price fluctuation range of $30 in the bull market and $3 in the bear market. These are estimated based on the token economics of ICP. The token economics of ICP is a very important reason why the price will not skyrocket. I call it shitnomics.

By the way, trying to curb inflation through staking is deluding yourself and trying to fool investors who have been taught to be smart by the market. Never succeed....

This is why bitcoin was created. Inflation is source of evil. And of course we care about TOKEN PRICE. You know many developers in the IC community have left DFINITY, including a great team which have developed many many projects such as plug wallet.

Sormarler | 2022-12-06 02:16:10 UTC | #33

I disagree sir. Inflation can be good for the economy in moderation. When prices are expected to rise in the future, people are more likely to spend money today rather than save it, which can help to boost demand for goods and services. This increased demand can encourage businesses to invest in production and hiring, leading to economic growth. Inflation can also help to reduce the burden of debt and provide a cushion against deflation. I do agree, it's important to keep inflation in check so that it doesn't become too high and erode the purchasing power of money. But a moderate level of inflation can be good for the economy. The same extends to cryptocurrency.

Indeed, the tokenomics of ICP truly is "shitnomics", but only to traders, not to long term investors. That's one of the main reasons I find ICP so attractive, since I'm a long term investor, not a trader. I have long despised the investor shitnomics in all other cryptocurrencies, which has turned the crypto industry into a ponzi scheme. 

All of that nasty inflation you speak of (gravitating towards only 5% max + node rewards of decreasing significance) can easily be offset with a far higher return on locked up ICP (over 15% when staked long term). That difference is enough to also cover the opportunity cost of that long term investment, at least in my view. The only question is what is a reasonable price for the long term expected burn rate, which I see as roughly equivalent to EPS, as explained above. What we do agree on is a bear market target price of $3 or less, which is what I've had in mind since I first came across ICP just under two months ago.

With respect to the theory of inflation, currency inflation does not necessarily translate into price inflation if the demand for the currency is growing faster than the currency supply. Real GDP growth alone is not far off from 5%, on average, so if the net demand for ICP grows at a faster rate than 5% minus the GDP growth rate over the long term, there will (in theory) be no price inflation in ICP terms, even though the ICP currency itself is inflating at 5% per year. In the very long term, if ICP takes over the entire Internet per Dom's nirvana scenario, the NNS can easily vote to reduce the long term currency inflation to be closer to either the real or nominal GDP growth rate for the sake of increased price stability. 

Arguably, it is price instability that is "evil" (per your other post), not mere inflation. On that note, although not a serious deficiency, BTC has no mechanism to stabilize against deflationary price instability, as compared to all other fiat (and most crypto) currencies that grow at least as much as GDP. Moreover, excess or hyper inflation is inevitably caused by perverse incentives to curry favor built into centralized political power, which don't really exist in truly decentralized organizations like DAOs.

However, the bulk of ICP value will come from ICP burning by the SNS ecosystem, which hasn’t even begun yet (beyond the SNS-1 beta test).
[/quote]

What do you mean by this? I doubt the SNSes themselves will cause major burns, the dApps ruled by them might, but that is yet to be seen. We aren't even sure whether it's realistic for a subnet to burn more than it mints to pay providers with average usage, let alone whether the whole network can churn through governance rewards.

This is one of the things which set ICP tokenomics apart from other chains and imo not in a good way: ETH, BTC, etc.. have a fixed monetary policy to bootstrap the network, if by the time those incentives are not worth it anymore the chain is not self sustainable then the project is considered a failure, the fixed inflation is used to pay both nodes and stakers (in ETH's case) cause running the network and governance coincide, ICP on the other hand hands out free goodies to node providers no matter what and mints a lot of tokens to pay stakers for simply clicking a couple buttons.

All things considered regardless of how promising the IC is and will be, there is no such thing as infinite growth and since price can increase much more easily than usage, there is a price range after which the network won't be actually deflationary anymore. This is technically true for ETH's too, provided it had infinite scalability and tx fees in the range of a few cents as price goes up there needs to be more adoption to burn more tokens, but in ETH's case (and 90% of similar L1s) nodes aren't paid individually but from a shared pool, so when demands increase the burn increases linearly too, on the IC demand must not only increase but increase enough so that the newly created subnet to serve that demand burns more than it mints. In simple terms if ICP's price 2x, the usage has to more than 2x, cause despite burning 2x more tokens on paper a % of those only offsets the subnet cost.

I'm not sure, keep in mind governance inflation is calculated on total supply, if we rely on staking as a form of deflation what will happen is inflation will increase year by year, so you're not only betting holders will stake a majority of the supply and keep it in the NNS but also that they'll keep merging their rewards AND that they'll merge an increasing amount every year, as time goes on that becomes less and less likely as long time investors will want to cash out and that could cause a chain reaction.

It's a bear market. Not every project will make it. Many are closing shops everywhere in crypto. If you take part in many communities outside of the internet computer ecosystem you would know that. It doesn't mean the L1 is the cause for that either. Sometimes people just don't have the funds to keep developing, especially in the current environment where the VC's are more cautious about handing easy money to teams. It is also likely that some are leaving because ICP does not work for them. On the positive side, many new devs are joining the $ICP ecosystem as well. How do I know? Because many actually reach out to me and I to them. Let's be realistic here. ICP is a start-up, and as such, chance of failure is always high like any startup. The constant doom and gloom predictions do not help though. Good analysis of potential weaknesses and solutions do.

Except both governance inflation and the cycles/ICP conversion rate are discretionary amounts that the NNS can change based on future market forces and growth rates. A death spiral can only be argued based on the node rewards (IC costs) being permanently above the revenue from those nodes (i.e., cycle burn from dApps). It the latter were true, then cloud services (and all of Web2) would already be dead, since no one could ever earn enough revenue to cover their cloud hosting costs. Moreover, Web2 is saddled with massive cybersecurity costs that Web3 (under the IC) simply does not have. Think about it.

Except this is simply not true. No doubt, not every developer who tries out the IC or works at DFINITY will stay, but the Github data, among other sources, totally refute that claim. Also, if the cycles/ICP conversion rate is too low to be sustainable, as many might argue, this would only attract more developers, not push them away. Developer hosting costs for their dApps would be artificially low and therefore more attractive in the shorter term.

Yes, of course I meant the dApps under the SNS, hence the word "ecosystem". I agree that this is an open question. However, it should be safe to assume that there is a profitable equilibrium point available for the IC to make significant margin on hosting dApps in a lower cost Web3 network as a monopoly provider, since Web2 hosting is obviously still very profitable in a much more competitive market.

There will likely be no shortage of prospective node providers at that point, so extra incentives won't be required. 

As for stakers getting too much in rewards, this is also purely discretionary and can be changed by the NNS, with no permanent impact necessary. Ultimately, this inflation is (in theory) meaningless to long term investors, since they could be OK with getting less rewards and having the ICP price be higher in 10 years due to less ICP supply, assuming everyone else is a long term investor like them. However, the bulk of individuals in crypto are not long term investors. They are traders clicking on their buy-sell buttons like cocaine monkeys. The ICP staking tokenomics works to filter out those individuals and to bias the rewards towards long term investors, which I strongly prefer and endorse.

Yes, and that inflation on total supply will drop to 5% not too long from now, and perhaps lower if the NNS sees this as too high in the future. The less individuals who stake, the more rewards go to those who stake, so there is a natural supply-demand equilibrium that should prevent a mass run for the exit as long as some staking rewards remain. 

As for unminted maturity, if that is what you are referring to, I consider these tokens as fully outstanding right now, since they represent a real claim on the ICP token economy with no future benefit to it. (Contrast this with shares issued in the future by a traditional company for fiat currency, which would represent a future benefit to that company.) I strongly suggest to DFINITY that there should be a panel on the IC dashboard to track this merged (or unspawned) maturity that has not yet been minted, since these shadow tokens represent a current claim on ICP market value in my view. They are not like in-the-money stock options in calculating fully diluted EPS numbers, since those options can only be converted to shares after paying a company the strike price to claim them. For unminted/unspawned maturity, these shadow tokens already represent a full claim on the current ICP market value. This is why they need to be tracked to calculate the true market cap. of ICP. If my logic is incorrect here, then please let me know, since I may be missing some information.

Providers get paid individually by minting tokens no matter the ICP price, rewards may get lowered but  there is no plan so it's speculation for now, just like lowering the NNS rewards, which if it were implemented might lower long term inflation but cause lots of tokens to be dissolved in the short-medium term. This kind of stuff should be carefully planned and monitored along the way, if we only act once the problem is apparent, it might be too late.

No matter how long one's investment timeframe is eventually he'll want to cash out something, what happens when 20 years from now millions of tokens are dissolved and hit circulation? 8 years might seem like a lifetime in crypto but for a network which is supposed to be part of the future internet it's not that much. Even at 5% yearly inflation, which is what I've based my analysis on that's 25 million ICP which either need to be burnt or compounded in the NNS every year, but by doing so the inflation is compounded too. In just 5 years that'd be 138 million ICP tokens added to the total supply and the yearly inflation would raise to 32 million a year and as time goes on it gets worse.

Do you really think stakers will not only keep their initial investment locked but also perpetually merge an amount which increases every year? All it takes is a sparkle and the house of cards might collapse, compounded interest is the 8th wonder of the world according to Einstein, but in our cause it might be IC's demise.

Again, the 5% inflation is not written in stone forever and can be changed. Moreover, even a slumbering level of GDP growth would eat up about half of that in a perpetuity scenario. Between that very long term and now, demand for ICP should grow at significantly more than that. When demand growth for a currency exceeds its supply growth, price deflation can occur (i.e., an increase in the value of ICP) in spite of any inflation in the currency supply. It is simply far too early to project these future growth rates with any certainty. However, the 5% inflation rate is a controllable variable in the long term and not a real cost like node rewards (excluding temporary extra incentives), so I'm not that concerned about it. In short, I don't agree with your logic about the imperative to burn or compound all inflation to keep the ICP price from declining.

You also seem to ignore the natural supply-demand pricing equilibrium in staking. Yes, one could argue that almost all staked ICP will eventually become unstaked. However, the more dissolving and unstaking that happens, the higher the compounded return being offered to those who remain staked or want to stake more given a higher return being offered.

It won't matter if by the time it is lowered there are hundreds of millions of ICP in the NNS, which could be dissolved due to the change and hit the market at any time, cratering the price. Dom himself forecasts 90% of the ICP being staked in the NNS, that would lower the 8year APR to 2-3% which is incredibly low for such a long and risky investment.

[quote="Sabr, post:52, topic:16125"]

That is cause for that to happen not enough tokens have to be staked staked and compounded so that the APR stays high and staking is worth the risk, which would in turn mean a considerable chunk of the yearly inflation must enter in circulation and we go back to the "at which price is it realistic to burn all those tokens" argument OR a majority of tokens are staked, APR slowly decreases, at which point 2 things can happen: 
Scenario 1:
- Stakers start slowly selling their rewards cause compounding isn't worth it anymore
- Nobody buys those tokens to stake cause the APR is too low
- Price dumps

Scenario 2:
- Large portion of tokens are dissolved.
- APR goes up
- The tokens are staked again
- APR goes back to where it was
- So long as there is a greater fool willing to restake the dissolved tokens the system works, sounds familiar?

No other chain uses staking as a true deflation metric cause being based on human behaviour it could cause negative feedback loops. I'm not saying it shouldn't in some way help regulating the supply but it shouldn't be the only factor to base a bullish thesis on.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-06 18:28:53 UTC | #59

Your scenario 2 makes no sense. Why would APR go back to where it was if APR pricing already pushed a large portion of tokens to be dissolved? There's a positively sloped supply curve along the APR price continuum. Why would the supply curve ever go perfectly vertical when both historical data and variable risk aversion among investors makes this effectively impossible? The same logic applies to your scenario 1, where staking demand suddenly drops off a cliff (i.e., ICP supply suddenly goes up vertically), in spite of APR increasing gradually and proportionally to compensate as unstaking increases.

As for Dom's 90% scenario, how would APR go below 5% if that is the overall inflation rate? If APR would be 2-3% with 90% staking, I can assure you that staking would be significantly less than 90% due to better APR opportunities at lower risk. That thought experiment is an irrelevant fantasy scenario.

I'm aware of this, as I pointed out in my math, where a target ICP price of roughly $175 in 10 years would require 40X more cycle burn than today to burn through the same amount of ICP for deflation purposes. That's why I said the current token price is still quite rich (not depressed), and why I think something under $3 (or even significantly less) could be a fair price for ICP today.

Why would APR go back to where it was if APR pricing already pushed a large portion of tokens to be dissolved?

That's assuming the tokens are restaked, otherwise they are added to circulation and we are back to the burn/price dilemma.

where staking demand suddenly drops off a cliff
[/quote]
It doesn't have to, depending on how much the price has been artificially inflated by the apparent scarcity even a small portion of dissolved tokens will have markets reconsider the token's valuation. How much staking demand must drop to cause issues depends on the price and how much the supply has inflated due to compounding.

[quote="Sabr, post:59, topic:16125"]
how would APR go below 5% if that is the overall inflation rate?
[/quote]
APR depends on your VP amount compared to others, so 5% would be the max APR if you were to stake for 8 years and keep compounding.

[quote="Sabr, post:59, topic:16125"]
If APR would be 2-3% with 90% staking, I can assure you that staking would be significantly less than 90% due to better APR opportunities at lower risk. That thought experiment is an irrelevant fantasy scenario.

That is effectively what the actual APR would be in that scenario, it might be fantasy but Dom seems to believe it's achievable, so I can't ignore that, mind you not cause I trust him to be right but cause he believe it's possible and might base his thesis on it.

I see nothing in what you wrote to support either a vertical ICP supply curve or a disastrous negative feedback effect on ICP supply due to historical ICP price changes (where supply = total ICP - staked ICP). If you can model this effect out somehow, where a doomsday scenario results instead of a new equilibrium, then please do so and show it.

What is happening to the ICP price now is basically price discovery in slow motion, as the original seed/early investors are given the choice for the first time (recurring each month) to dissolve or keep a sizable portion of their ICP staked. Since this slow motion ICP supply pressure has been clearly upwards - and even more so in a bear market with higher interest rates, where fiat funds are more scarce - that puts downward pressure on the ICP price. Although I expect this pressure to continue through 2023 and beyond, this is ultimately a temporary effect (and of diminishing importance) until price discovery comes much closer to a natural equilibrium between ICP supply (as defined above) and demand. 

However, countering this downward price pressure is the growth (and future perceived growth) in the ICP ecosystem. So if someone is trying to time a good entry point for investing in ICP, it would be when the latter pressure begins to exceed the former. When that will be is uncertain, since it depends on the market's perceptions. Another problem with trying to time this flip in relative price pressure is that the ICP price will likely spike upwards more quickly when the market collectively perceives that this flip has definitively occurred. 

I know it is frustrating if you are already heavily invested, but just be patient. The price will most likely deteriorate more into 2023, but at some point this flip in price pressure will happen if the IC ecosystem growth continues on its current trend or higher. Feel free to mark my words here for future reference.

What I'm talking about has nothing to do with current or past price action, ICP barely had the time and adoption necessary for any real tokenomic test to play out, it was merely a victim of a series of unfortunate events. 

I think we got a bit lost in the woods discussing, my thesis is quite simple:
Do you believe the supply/demand ratio dictates price in an efficient and rational market? 
If the answer is yes, then we must figure how to get that ratio in our favour:

If IC had node rewards only as inflation then simply increasing the usage would trigger deflation and lower the supply, causing price to go up. The XDR exchange mechanism applies to both node rewards and cycle conversion, as long as cycle burn is greater the node rewards threshold, the supply deflates and price action reflects it.

But there is more: governance rewards. They are denominated in ICP tokens and vary based on a % of total supply, say 5%. As ICP price increases the value in XDR of those tokens does too, so either:
- Usage must increase exponentially to offset the reduced token burn caused by the higher price.
- Tokens minted to pay stakers don't have to enter circulation at all.
- A combination of the 2.

Since there is no such thing as infinite growth the new question is what is the maximum amount of governance tokens that can enter circulating supply while still keeping deflation (on the circulating supply) going? That depends on the ICP price.

As price increases due to the apparent scarcity so does the value of those tokens exiting the NNS and we face the same problem again: how can we keep circulating supply stable or deflating? 
- Increasing usage
- Reducing the number of tokens hitting the market. 
- A combination of the 2.

Usage is constrained by physical factors and hoping the NNS tokens outflows would decrease with time is irresponsible, as:

1) Long time stakers will want to cash out
2) Its unlikely stakers not only keep merging, but also keep merging an amount which increases every year, due to the 5% being compounded yearly, inflating the supply.

Furthermore as price keeps increasing due to apparent scarcity, the aforementioned outflow amount required to stop deflation keeps getting lower.

So to sum it up: 
- Price goes up due to fake deflation.
- Stakers eventually might want to cash out.
- Yearly rewards increase due to inflation.
- Number of tokens that must exit the NNS to stop the fake deflation lowers.

Seems like a negative feedback loop to me and our only hope against relies on greater fool theory, that being the assumption there is always someone else who will restake the NNS outflow tokens.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-06 20:43:46 UTC | #64

I agree with most of the dynamics that you pointed out, but none of that demonstrates any negative feedback loop leading to some sort of death spiral or other doomsday scenario. The ICP and APR price mechanisms will ultimately reach and maintain a relatively stable equilibrium. Both the tokenomics logic and the historical data show that. 

For example, the % of all ICP staked has stayed at roughly the same % over time, with a slight downward trend due to the temporary impact of seed/early investors getting their first opportunities each month to choose an exit (i.e., not because of any negative feedback loop). There have been no dramatic shifts in this % since inception, excluding the one-time shift at the end of 2021 for tax or similar reasons that are not systemic in nature.

On the one hand, you are so worried about the ICP price going up causing major problems, but on the other you are so worried about a perpetual excess of inflation in ICP token supply (at only a 5%/yr. level), which can only have a long term downward pressure on price. That's basically a false dichotomy fallacy, since the APR pricing mechanism is always there to help gravitate the ICP price and supply towards an equilibrium. So I don't see the problem here. 

The "greater fool theory" is what the rest of the crypto industry has relied upon for years to pump up prices and dump supply for greater fools to buy, totally oblivious to any fundamentals around actual coin utility. That metaphor simply cannot apply to a coin that is gradually decreasing in price over time as a result of slow motion price discovery that is easily apparent per the ICP dashboard.

Inch_Deen | 2022-12-06 20:55:35 UTC | #65

All you said is just based on your guess, no data.
we just talk about the real situation for now.
1. first, ignore the LP staking, because it depends on people, and finally they will cash out for making money, rely on LP to reduce inflation is meaningless, because they are still exist.  you say ETH LP staking won't be taken out?  but ETH staking are counted in total number, the total is still in deflation.
2. based on several year later, the min 5% inflation of ICP.  we neglect the total increase in nex few years, just based on now, it's new huge inflation number is about 25,000,000 - 30,000,000 ICP release.
3. we know cycle burns based on token price, if price goes up, means less burned happens. just according the price of now, ICP 4$, after i calculate, it only can burn about 100,000 ICP according to nowdays cycle burn rate situation. We defnitely know if price goes up to 8$, means only hafl of 100,000 can be burned. 
now we calculate how much cycle burn rates does ICP needs to eliminate all inflation per year at just price 4$.
30,000,000/100,000 =300, it means the cycle burns needs 300x times than now can destory the inflation every year.
how do u think it can increase to 300x times? no way. let alone the price goes up to 8$, it needs 600x time than now.
4. ignore the transaction fee, it's only 0.0001 per time. nearly 0.
5. plus i don't add the extra nodes rewards.

tell me how do u think it can be success under such terrible infnite huge inflation?
it seems like a bank keep printing money day by day without stopping.
we all know, neither coin in crypto history like this can be successful. 
ETH BTC DOT ADA MATIC and so on, they all have constant total number or be on deflation road.

Inch_Deen | 2022-12-06 21:02:34 UTC | #66

it's already in death spiral now , see the price , even solana won't fall down hunders times.
huge inflation make the total coin from start 469 to 500 million. increase 31 millions ICP. the price from 750$ to 3.5 $ lowest. how do u say it does not in spiral death. It already happend.

any test show you are right? no. but everything happend shows it's terrible and worst tokenism.

That has been the case so far yes, but it won't last forever and many projects have designed tokenomics which enable price appreciation through utility and burn mechanism, staking is mainly used as an incentive to be honest rather than a form of deflation.

That can happen if the scenario Dom is aiming for becomes true, when the lead of Dfinity aims for it, then I can't ignore such a possibility. 90% of tokens staked would cause both to happen? Is that possible? It doesn't matter if Dfinity ultimately think it is, cause they might have based their tokenomics and possible future modifications on it.

Sabr | 2022-12-06 22:06:24 UTC | #71

But staking has been on a steady downward trend over 1.5 years and under 54% of total supply staked. I will put some weight on a 90% staking scenario when you can find some logic or facts to back that fantasy scenario up. The only way it could reasonably reverse course is if staking rewards go up. However, that's not the case - they must go down per the inflation schedule going down to 5%. What's in Dom's head won't change the math or the pricing mechanisms.

A declining token price does not a death spiral make. As I already explained, this current (but temporary) trend is simply due to slow motion price discovery as a result of seed/early investors having the choice to dissolve or sell their tokens for the first time, recurring each month.

You are implying that the real ICP supply is about 540 million tokens instead of 492 million (less the maturity modulation % on that 48-49M, which is currently 5%). Is this what you intended? 

My understanding of this chart is that it shows all cumulative voting rewards since genesis in May 2021, most of which has likely been minted/spawned. I don't think the math works if all of this is still unminted/unspawned maturity, but perhaps someone from DFINITY can confirm. My interest is knowing exactly what the **unminted** maturity total is, since that is required to calculate the true market cap. of ICP.

EDIT: I think the dashboard graph to the right of the one you linked ("ICP converted from maturity") may be most of the difference. So if the cumulative voting rewards since genesis have been 49M, and the ICP converted from maturity is roughly 20M, then this implies that unminted maturity is roughly 49M - 20M - lost rewards from maturity modulation < 100%. The latter is an unknown number, but it could be roughly estimated.

The total ICP supply (492M ICP) does not include maturity. With that said, yes if all maturity was converted to ICP tomorrow, then after maturity modulation the total supply would be around 539M ICP.

Maturity is unminted by definition. The *Voting Rewards (Maturity)* chart does not show cumulative voting rewards since Genesis, it shows total maturity in all neurons since Genesis. When maturity is converted to ICP, it no longer exists and is no longer part of this chart, but the ICP minted from that maturity becomes part of the *ICP Converted from Maturity* chart.

To get the total cumulative voting rewards since Genesis, you have to look at both of these charts (i.e., add them together). This data used to be in a single stacked chart, which was perhaps more clear, but it was separated into multiple charts when maturity modulation was implemented, since maturity and ICP are no longer 1:1.

This thread is fascinating to me.

I think the IC could become deflationary in the future when our own personal computers and cellphones are nodes. 
Do I think it’s necessary that the IC focus on becoming deflationary? Absolutely not - it doesn’t make any sense for them or anyone to, especially with how low ICP inflation is and how little importance it is to the price of ICP - which I conclude is what the thread is really about. 

Some posts in this thread compare ICP inflation to fiat inflation, you can’t compare the two, these are different kinds of inflation. Another post compares ICP to a corporations stock or a security, that’s not comparable either. 

When you get past these incorrect models of how to value ICP you can focus on the important factors like network effects and the inflation of ICP is moot because it’s so small it’s almost irrelevant.

There are 13 kinds of network effects.  [13 Types Of Network Effects ](https://youtu.be/oB_NM_kL6rM)

We should also look at Metcalfe’s law when looking at how to value the ICP. To simplify it, the value is equal to the square of the # of users. 

A good metric we can look at to simplify network effects is the chart that Dom shared on Twitter today… cycles burned have grown 700% over the past year while Kyle Langham shared that the annualized inflation from January to October was 3.8%.

To me it sounds like ICP is growing at a ridiculously insane 700% YoY with 3.8% Annualized Inflation YTD (October) that we should  refer to as network costs. Inflation isn’t an issue, it’s extremely low and we’re in a bear market not a death spiral. Market effects and user growth will result in higher valuations for ICP when the entire market corrects when we pull out of the bear market. We must continue to focus on growth in the meantime.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-07 02:36:22 UTC | #82

Thanks for that clarification, @Dylan. To help alleviate some confusion, the title of the first chart should probably be something like "Maturity (Unminted Voting Rewards Excl. Maturity Modulation)". The focus of this graph per the Y-axis label is simply cumulative "Maturity", which is a subset of cumulative "Voting Rewards". The "Excl. Maturity Modulation" addition is somewhat implied, but I think that clarification should be added too in order to avoid any potential misinterpretation.

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-07 06:39:03 UTC | #83

what you are thinking is totally wrong and seems terrible ! that is just because some few ones like u think the ICP is good engouh which really casued such a bad price and let them igore the huge inflation.
ICP has min 5% inflation every years. means at least 30,000,000 new tokens generated based on today's total number. No matter whether people choose released them or locked them, they are existing. U can't imagine peopel will locked them forever because people all come for making more money. that's the truth.

but you can see the cycles burn rate today. it can only burn less than 100,000 tokens per year even though we calculate the burned number at price 4 $, we all know if price goes up there means even less burned.
pls don't say how it will grow on IC eco, because it doesn't happen but the huge inflation is already happening and will keep going inflation forever.

after calculations of burning rate. ICP need 400x times cycles burn rate than now, which can destroy every year's huge inflation. But i still calculate it at price 4$. if price goes to 8$,  needs 800x times cycles burn rate than now, which can eliminate the huge infaltion.

I just want to ask u, how can u ensure that ICP cycles burn rate will reach more than 10000x times than now which can eliminate the huge inflation per year, that can only make ICP price reach 100$!
it's impossible, but huge inflation has already become reality! under such bad tokenomics, It will never be success, ICP has already goes into death spiral now ! don't u see? don't say it because of early seeds investor, the real reason is huge inflation.

about the maturity, No matter whether people choose released them or locked them, they are existing. U can’t imagine peopel will locked them forever because people all come for making more money. that’s the truth. if u don't want to make money from this, u will not care about ICP that's also truth, but u will say if u lock all of your token and won't release them for ever?

-------------------------

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-07 06:48:18 UTC | #85

by the way, i will tell u the truth, what Dom say it increase 700% is meaningless, because the real burned token is 15,000 per year, even increase 700% it only can burn 100,000 ICP every year! the baseline is too small.
But do u know the huge inflation is 30,000,000 per year ! and it will keep inflation forever. 5% for u is too small? not more than 10 years, the total number will increase 70% than today.

ICP NNS like a bank keep printing money for them without stop forever.

For the calculation of Kyle Langham shared, he doesn’t include the maturity of nns. but that’s not means people will not release them, if poeple choose release them, only seven days is enough to release all of their maturity token.
what Kyle calculated before are showed totaly wrong and never happen. we all see the processing of ICP falling from 750 $ to lowest 3.5$, none of his assumpiton come true.

How is this a bad thing? It looks like some entrepreneurial developers who worked at DFINITY are now going out on their own to help build the IC with their dApps. In my view, the more that IC development is decentralized away from DFINITY, the better. Why would you prefer more centralization and increasing dependence on DFINITY? This is particularly true with respect to dApps, since DFINITY needs to focus on the protocol, not on the dApps running on top of it.

The only way it can become deflationary is when the adoption and usage on the IC significantly improves! This means that cool apps that EVERYONE in crypto and AFTER that everyone else not in crypto wants or needs to use. Innovation on the USER side of things must be priority number one! Only than the burn mechanism can achieve something against inflation. Sonic alone had a nice bump in usage when it launched but it was a one time event and adoption failed.

I don't care who hides behind peer to peer transactions. Privacy is a right, not a privilege. Moreover, blockchain transactions are generally in full, unobstructed view for the entire planet to see, so blockchain alone doesn't really hide any of these transactions.

Anyway, you (and others) still haven't answered my question about what "DEFI" is actually financing in the real world. It's proven to be a failure to date in tokenizing securities, and using crypto as a real world currency is also proving to be a failure beyond extremely inefficient money laundering use cases. One day, currencies will be blockchain-based. However, they will almost certainly be CBDCs issued by governments, with the exception of small third-world countries or countries targeted by the U.S. regime's starvation sanctions. All other cryptocurrencies will be too volatile in price vs. real goods to use for day-to-day transactions, payroll, etc. Clearly, crypto enthusiasts aren't investing in crypto to buy government-issued and tracked CBDCs, so where does that leave the "DEFI" value narrative in the long term?

Sorry to revive an old thread. Presumably, some amount of maturity is restaked and some amount of maturity is left as maturity in the neuron and is able to become liquid ICP. Is there a way to see "liquid" (Maturity which could be converted to ICP at any time the neuron controller decides) maturity vs "locked" (maturity which has been merged into a neuron which is locked for some period) maturity?
