After upgrading dfx (to 0.8.0), `__Candid_UI` shows this error:
![candid_ui_error|690x106](upload://wQugHralKpII1ROlg7Ip7IVZn2X.png)
I read [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/fail-to-verify-certificate-in-development-update-calls/4078) that similar issues were related to hardcoded keys.
How can I overcome this?
Thanks

It will be fixed in the next dfx release. If you want to get it sooner, either deploy the canister on the IC and use https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/. Or build the wasm here: https://github.com/dfinity/candid/tree/master/tools/ui and install locally.
