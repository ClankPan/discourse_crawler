I want to make (in Rust) a Web robot (an app outside IC) that stores an II and uses this II to connect to IC.

Which file format? How to generate an II? Should I use [`BasicIdentity`](https://docs.rs/ic-agent/latest/ic_agent/identity/struct.BasicIdentity.html) or should I use some form of delegate idenity? etc.?

Note that the monetary amount of loss of stealing this identity by a hacker is rather low. But I want to follow good security guidelines anyway, to learn in the way.

@qwertytrewq: Would you mind expanding your use-case a little bit further? Do you need just some identity to interact with the IC or do you need an identity issued by Internet Identity specifically? If so, _why_ does the web robot need an II?

I would suggest to generate a BasicIdentity as you suggested and simply use that (without being tied to Internet Identity in any way).

I need some identity compatible with IC.

The robot needs an identity to send requests to IC that only this robot is allowed to do (simply, API authentication).

How to generate `BasicIdentity`?

@qwertytrewq: You can generate an [ED25519 key pair](https://docs.rs/ring/0.17.8/ring/signature/struct.Ed25519KeyPair.html) from a secure random source and then initialize the `BasicIdentity` with that.
