Hi, 

I updated my token image shortly after the SNS sale however I don't believe this updated my ledger canister's metadata. I need it to update so OpenChat pulls in this updated token image.

Any information appreciated.

I also believe doing this will double the cost of the list_proposal command. Currently I have one proposal in that response that contains the logo payload, I worry adding another will double that cost. I think currently around 2T cycles a day.

If I understand correctly, by "updating token image" you mean this proposal: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/gyito-zyaaa-aaaaq-aacpq-cai/proposal/23 (BTW, it could be helpful to add links to your question, it might be possible that someone is able to help but they don't know which proposal/SNS you are talking about)

Note that the ledger token is different than the SNS metadata, and the ability to update the ledger token logo was just recently added: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/managing/making-proposals#manageledgerparameters.

> I also believe doing this will double the cost of the list_proposal command. 

My understanding is that at this time the payload size of list_proposals (when a ManageSnsMetadata proposal appears there, with a logo) does cause more cycle burn, and it should soon be addressed by a new SNS Governance version, if everything goes well.
