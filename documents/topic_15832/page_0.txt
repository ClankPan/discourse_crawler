Cross posting this for future askers.

If you need to store an imported type like the `Principal` type in the StableBTreeMap, the suggested method of doing so is by wrapping it in a custom tuple struct and using it. Looks like this:

```rust
struct StablePrincipal(Principal);

impl Storable for StablePrincipal {
  // implement the storable trait for Principal.
}
```
