Does anyone know why I'm getting

`type error [M0072], field toArray does not exist in type
  Blob`?

The docs say it does exist:

https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/motoko-ref/Blob#value-toarray


```
public shared (msg) func create_user() : async User {
    // Get caller principal
    let callerId = msg.caller;
    let principal_blob : Blob = callerId.toBlob();
    let principal_array : [Nat8] = principal_blob.toArray();
...
```

and why is it treating it as a field instead of a function?

Alternatively is there a better to get the principal's array from inside an authenticated call to a function?

Not sure if my syntax ever worked or if I just made it up but it seems to be `Blob.toArray(principal_blob)` , etc.

As a quick PSA, both the [Motoko VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dfinity-foundation.vscode-motoko) and [Motoko Playground](https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/) provide value conversion [code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) such as `blob-2-array`, `array-2-buffer`, etc. It's also easy to [suggest](https://github.com/dfinity/vscode-motoko/issues/new) or [contribute](https://github.com/dfinity/node-motoko/blob/main/contrib/snippets.json) a snippet if you think something is missing, since this is a crowdsourced feature. Cheers!

That's great. I have the extension but hadn't noticed.
