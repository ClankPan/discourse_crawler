Seriously, I started doubting anyone is actually using `dfx nns install` to test proposals...

Anyway, so I "resolved" my previous issue about Neuron Fund ([thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-nns-local-proposal-fail-cannot-compute-neurons-fund-participation-intervals/33015)) by setting the participation to neuron fund to `false` in the SNS.yaml. However, now, when I submit a proposal, it fails because some canister hasn't enough cycles.

I'm not aware of any post-installation command that should be run after `dfx nns install` or are there some command documented somewhere? If not, how to solve the issue?

@Severin the root cause of this issue is the fact that `dfx nns install` spins the SNS-Wasm canister with too little cycles - i.e. it is not even deployed with enough cycles to pass one SNS proposal.

To solve the issue I ran following command in my terminal targetting that canister `dfx canister deposit-cycles 50000000000000 qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai`. However, that's just enough cycles to pass a single SNS proposal and unfortunately, if I ran the command again, I get following issue:

> ❯ dfx canister deposit-cycles 50000000000000 qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai

Is there a command I can run to provide that canister enough cycles?

You can conjure a bunch of cycles like this:
```
dfx ledger fabricate-cycles --canister qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai --t 9999999999
```

CC @Andre-Popovitch: this looks like a feature request :slightly_smiling_face:

Thanks a lot Severin! I'll try that later.

Your command goes maybe over the top? :wink:

I got this error with it:

Ah the command is in T Cycles :crazy_face:

```
dfx ledger fabricate-cycles --canister qaa6y-5yaaa-aaaaa-aaafa-cai --t 100
```

Thanks again, it worked out!

100 T Cycles seems to be just enough for one test, so I fabricated 100000 T Cycles. Let's see if it least longer.
