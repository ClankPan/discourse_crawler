Are we able to deploy applications to the mainnet yet? If so how are cycles added to the canister?

Network deployment
Following the instructions given here :slight_smile: 
https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html

Enjoying learning. However, I have stumbled on this. Please help

% dfx ledger account-id
error: Found argument 'ledger' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

% dfx --help
dfx 0.6.26 
No options or subcommands: 'ledger'

Hi
Youâ€™ll need to upgrade dfx to 0.7.0 to see the ledger sub command. 
Add DFX_VERSION=0.7.0 before the installation command.  
DFX_VERSION=0.7.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"

**Impossible to deploy on the mainnet !!**

The commands took me some ICP, not a big amount fortunately, but guys, is it nice to give the information in the bottom of a page that is not the getting started tutorial ?
https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/token-holders/nns-app-quickstart.html#_deploy_a_canister_with_cycles
    

    Because application subnets are not yet widely available to the general public, you should not convert ICP tokens to cycles on the Internet Computer.

    For an introduction to developing applications locally, see the Local development quick start and Tutorials.

See below my journey results:

`lisica@lisica-20n2000lfr:~/prog/dfinity/hello$ dfx ledger --network ic balance`

`lisica@lisica-20n2000lfr:~/prog/dfinity/hello$ dfx ledger --network ic create-canister blah-blih... --amount .00001`

The team is still adding subnets, until this process hasn't finished you cannot deploy to mainnet just yet. If you want to deploy a frontend you can try fleek.co to bypass this restriction :)

I am getting that same error when deploying on fleek. Super-simple static site, tried different docker images with no luck.

gladguy | 2021-06-01 09:27:13 UTC | #8

Whats your error ?  I deployed in fleek.co

-------------------------

gladguy | 2021-06-01 09:27:34 UTC | #9

You might ask them for support, they have a slack channel and are super helpful!

Is still the deployment to mainnet is not supported?
I am still getting issue with dfx deploy --network=ic..
