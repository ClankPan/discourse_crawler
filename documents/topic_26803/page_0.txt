Hi every one, can anyone help me to learn how to integrate ckETH in the projects, there's no documentations that guide me so I can do it. :frowning:

Im part of the Zona Tres team that is a dev community who are building Hobbi and some other projects💪🏼

Hi @cristinaLoustaunau,

Thank you for raising this. We should be more clear in our docs and examples regarding this.

ckETH is a ICRC-1/2 compliant token, and hence you can follow any documentation/example that integrates with such tokens. 

Relevant documentation:
- https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/icrc-1/
- https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-4/4.2-icrc-tokens

and examples:

- https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/samples/pos
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/icrc2-swap

The relevant canister IDs for ckETH and ckSepoliaETH can be found here: 

- [ckETH](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/ethereum/cketh/mainnet/canister_ids.json)
- [ckSepoliaETH](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/ethereum/cketh/testnet/canister_ids.json)

Hope this will get you started.
