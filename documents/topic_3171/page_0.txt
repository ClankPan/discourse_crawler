This is a general concept that is still new and may be a start-up idea for the Beacon Fund :pleading_face:. Collaboration and input is still welcome.

The start-up would be focused on material design/simulation for the DFINITY 'environment'. The research and development here will be focused on making the DFINITY network have realistic abstractions of real life materials. The properties of the material would be based on actual data from scientific research to emulate realism is any dfinity environment. This characteristics could be properties like hardness/durability.

*Research can go into new types of material for the network with new possibilities*

The market value comes from generating/making(with cycles) the material/blocks that designers/developers will then use to build. Think minecraft but on blockchain..

This was just a random daydream.
