Interesting idea!

Could you share a bit more about your background and your intention with this project? 

A similar project that @JoakimEQ once pitched me would be to create an [Interchain Security Module (ISM) for Hyperlane](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/ISM/modular-security) on the basis of ICP's Chain Fusion tech.

Hi Dom,
I have worked in Web2 for a while in some big and small companies, have been looking into the blockchain space for a while and am working currently in an ICP-based DAO.

Well, with this project, my aim is to get an efficient and reliable infrastructure in place for a DVN. Then reuse it to grow it into an ecosystem of oracle services, powering both an independent protocol and supporting other protocols like it does for LayerZero.

I haven't looked into Hyperlane in depth. But the idea of ISMs seem similar to DVNs, and the same infrastructure can be extended to include it and other similar protocols.
