Hi everyone,

Based on some requests from the community ([link](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/guidance-on-how-to-mint-new-tokens-via-sns-proposal/22562), [link](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dragginz-dkp-sns-1-tokenomics/23321)), and as announced on [the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-sns-ability-to-mint-sns-tokens-revised-thresholds-for-voting/23382), DFINITY proposed an implementation of SNS token minting (link to proposal here), and the proposal was adopted! SNS token minting is now possible through a new proposal: MintSnsTokens. Please refer to the [docs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/managing/making-proposals#native-proposals) for more details.

Note that MintSnsTokens, as well as DeregisterDappCanisters and TransferSnsTreasuryFunds, are now considered “critical” and have increased voting thresholds (for SNS governance canisters running on the latest version). Non-critical proposals can be passed if 3% of the total voting power votes yes and 50% of the exercised voting power votes yes. Critical proposals can only be passed if 20% of the total voting power votes yes and 67% of the exercised voting power votes yes. This helps ensure that these proposals can only be passed with broad community support. The NNS Dashboard and NNS-Dapp have been updated to make this clear to voters.

As this change has been approved by the NNS, all new SNS deployments will have it. Already-existing SNSs can upgrade to make sure this functionality is available on their SNS Governance.

We are excited to hear your feedback about this feature!

Thank you,

Andre Popovitch
