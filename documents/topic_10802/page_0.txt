Let's say there is a code
(Implementation TrieMap)

```
let FS = F.FilesStorage<Guid, Blob>(GUID.equal, GUID.hash);
```
Are there size limits (Blob in byte) per record in the collection, or is the size limited by the maximum size of the container?

Neither. The size of an entry is only limited by the available memory, or the cycles needed to allocate it.
