Hello Internet Computer Community! :wave: 

I hope this post finds you all well and enthusiastic about the upcoming **Ethereum Community Conference** (EthCC). While EthCC primarily focuses on Ethereum, it's an excellent opportunity for us, the Internet Computer community, to engage with like-minded individuals, explore cross-chain possibilities, and showcase the potential of the Internet Computer.

As we all know, EthCC is the largest annual European Ethereum event dedicated to technology and community. With its four intense days of conferences, networking, and learning, it provides a platform for us to connect, share ideas, and collaborate.

Additionally, on **[date-range from=2023-07-17T15:00:00 to=2023-07-17T15:25:00 timezone="Europe/Paris"]**, there will be an insightful talk on the Main Stage titled "**Fully On-Chain: Internet Computer**". Dominic Williams will shed light on the shift towards a fully decentralized future. Discover how the Internet Computer (ICP) is leading the way in hosting not just tokens but also vast amounts of data, compute capabilities, and even the web itself.

Moreover, a **side event** organized by DFINITY, called "**Bonjour ETH! ICP Rooftop Soirée**" will be taking place during EthCC. This event promises a delightful evening filled with captivating conversations, music, and an enchanting ambiance, all atop a beautiful rooftop venue.

In light of these fantastic events, I would like to extend a warm invitation to each member of our Internet Computer community to join me and fellow enthusiasts for a meetup during EthCC and the ICP Rooftop Soirée. It's an opportunity to deepen our connections, exchange ideas, and discuss the potential of the Internet Computer within the larger Ethereum ecosystem.
