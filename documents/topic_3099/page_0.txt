I'm trying to figure out how to list all active NNS proposals. According to https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org there are ~334 ones, but I get the following on the cli:

```
bash-3.2$ CANISTER=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
bash-3.2$ dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet call $CANISTER list_proposals
The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai trapped explicitly: Panicked at 'Deserialization Failed: "No more values to deserialize"', /builds/dfinity-lab/dfinity/rs/rust_canisters/dfn_core/src/endpoint.rs:34:21"
bash-3.2$
```

I can list pending proposals with get_pending_proposals but I only see one there I think.

As described by [did interface file](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-ifaces/blob/master/governance.did#L245), the querhy function list_proposals have a arguments, whose type is ListProposalInfo:
```did
  list_proposals : (ListProposalInfo) -> (ListProposalInfoResponse) query;
```

Thanks, flyq. I'm trying to list *all* proposals. Does ListProposalInfo establish a filter for list_proposals?

Yes, there are some kinds of proposals, such as a proposal with resticted voting. 
> A proposal with resticted voting is included only if the caller is allowed to vote on the proposal. 

> Returns the proposals info of proposals with proposal ID less  than `before_proposal` (exclusive), returning at most `limit` proposal  infos.
