I want the following:

1. associate to each user's principal in my dapp an ICP-holding account
2. make it easy for a user to top-up this account

The first I don't know to do, because I know about [nns.icp0.app](https://nns.ic0.app) accounts, but I need this account not on `nns.icp0.app` but on app UI. So, how? (How a dapp can create an account for itself?)

The second, is there an easier way than the user manually copying&pasting the account address to `nns.icp0.app` to pay? The payments may be done by the user multiple times; should he/she copy&paste every time?

[README.md](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/blob/master/motoko/icp_transfer/README.md) explains how to do it. Particularly, it tells that
```bash
dfx ledger account-id --of-canister icp_transfer_backend
```
command can be used to know the account ID that the canister controls.

It remains the questions, however, how to do this in Motoko, rather than in `dfx` command line.

Here's some Motoko functions you can copy/paste that I wrote a while back: https://github.com/sesi200/memeployer/blob/07e5c69e7121f8524851124d36193a6edeb22d69/src/memeployer_backend/Account.mo#L28-L48
