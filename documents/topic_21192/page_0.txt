Hello!
Is there any possibility that those beautiful emojis for #IC, #ICP ever coming back?
Would like to see these masterpieces show back so we can showcase them on our twitter dashboard and posts.
@Manu @chepreghy @kpeacock @Kyle_Langham sers any update on this will be appreciated :slight_smile:

Hey there, unfortunately you only get that emoji, if you hit certain ad spend on Twitter, which is a rather high threshold. Currently we are trying to make sure that our budget is spent effectively. If we come up with ideas on how to utilize Twitter ads better, we might see a comeback of the emoji, but there are no plans currently.
