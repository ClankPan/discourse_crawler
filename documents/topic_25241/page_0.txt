I have extracted the method [parse_read_state_response]( https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/0a0887f717e203ea931e86ae1bfdfb33a3e28ece/rs/canister_client/src/cbor.rs#L46) from the IC (Internet Computer) source code, which is used for parsing and signature verification of read_state within a canister. It was running smoothly a month ago, but now I've observed that this function throws an exception under the **inspect_message** function. Interestingly, it works fine under the **update** function. When tested in a local IC virtual environment, the function exhibits no exceptions under both **inspect_message**and **update** function.

I don't see why it wouldn't work all the time. What problem are you observing?

When I comment out the `parse_read_state_response` method in the inspect_message function, the request can be passed.

Assigned to the corresponding method of `ic_cdk::api::call::method_name().as_str()`, using `parse_read_state_response` in the corresponding method can pass and parse `Result<RequestStatus, String>` normally

It seems that `parse_read_state_response` method cannot be used in `inspect_message` :joy:

I commented the code in the `inspect_message` method line by line and redeployed it to the IC chain for testing. I found that only `parse_read_state_response` could not be executed without commenting it out. Because I could not find how to throw an error in `inspect_message`, I could not determine what happened to it.

Maybe to step back a little: What are you trying to accomplish? I'm struggling to come up with a scenario where you would want to run this in `inspect_message` (TBH I'm not sure about running it in an update call either, but there I can see it a bit better). In general this is code that is not meant to be executed in a canister
