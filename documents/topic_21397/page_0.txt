So I upgraded my dfx to 0.14.2, and saw this strange error. 
It resisted upgrading my canister, by throwing I am not the controller of canister, but this happens only when I am upgrading my canister with a new network config added in dfx.json. 

So I added staging as a network in dfx.json like this :

```
"stag": {
			"providers": [
				"https://ic0.app"
			],
			"type": "persistent"
		}
```

Now canisters with network ic are getting upgraded normally, but when i am deploying canister with flag **--network stag**, it throws i am not the controller of canister, but as soon as i changed network of canister in canister_ids.json file, it got upgraded normally.

So should i change network configs in dfx.json? Or its a sdk error?

My bad, I put in some error message logic that fails in this circumstance. 

It should work if you use provider `https://icp0.io` instead of `https://ic0.app`. I would bet it has something to do with the [domain switch](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/follow-up-on-item-new-canisters-will-only-be-accessible-through-the-icp0-io-domain-existing-canisters-will-be-accessible-both-through-ic0-app-and-icp0-io/18889), and there is probably some logic in 0.14 that doesn't play nice with the old domain

Ahhh I see. Actually, I should have used icp0.io only, but somehow I also didn't notice that. Thanks btw.
