Hey there, i was wondering what is the best way to manage your neurons on the NNS App. I wanted to know which strategy is the best, knowing that i'm willing to hold my first neuron for a long time. Is it more convenient to hold the maturity of your first neuron until the end of the dissolve delay and claim the relative reward or to create new neurons everytime you can?

Thanks to all of those that will share they're opinions!
