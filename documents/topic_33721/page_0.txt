Hi!
I am trying to check the documentation about deploying a node. Some says a subnet must be first there, and in a wiki page it was written, no need to more Nodes. Someone have advice?

The [wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Documentation)does have the most up-to-date information on node onboarding. There is an effort to migrate the information onto the docs.  

It is correct that no node providers are being onboarded at the moment.
