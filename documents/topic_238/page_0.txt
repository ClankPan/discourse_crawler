Hi team,
I got the message below. It's possibly due to a sync problem. It appearded after using *dfx stop && dfx start -- backgroud && dfx install hello* a few times, so maybe it was started before being properly stopped or something like that. BTW, after *dfx stop*, *nodemanager* was still running.
I also tried to remove /tmp/ic* and /tmp/client_config/ with no success.
My setup: Ubuntu 18
*uname -a* = 4.15.0-69-generic #78-Ubuntu SMP Wed Nov 6 11:30:24 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
I suppose it can be solved with a reboot. I'll edit the post if it's not the case.

Thanks Louis, it does sound like a process not terminating, for now you could try:
killall client nodemanager dfx

Thanks, in the end *client* was still running. killing it got the job done.
BTW my name is Guillaume, I inverted the nick and real name at register ;-).
