We invite the first batch of [Relation](https://app.relationlabs.ai/) users (registered before [date=2022-05-01 timezone="Asia/Singapore"]) to participate in governing their data spaces. Tasks for users to complete:

* Access the canister under their control and take a screenshot of the canister's status.
* Delete the canister under their control.
* Reply to this post with the deleted canisterId and paste the canister's status before deletion.

Note: The user's relationId in the Relation application corresponds to the canisterId they control.
