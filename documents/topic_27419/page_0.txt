Traditional KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) relies on centralized authorities collecting and verifying user data. This raises concerns about:

* **Privacy & Security:** Centralized entities hold vast amounts of sensitive data, vulnerable to breaches and misuse.
* **Trust:** Users have limited control over their data and rely on authorities' trustworthiness.
* **Access:** Excluding individuals without access to traditional verification methods from financial services.
* **Transparency:** Lack of clarity and potential bias in verification processes.

**Trustless KYC/AML aims to:**

* **Empower users:** Give individuals control over their KYC data and verification process.
* **Enhance privacy:** Minimize data collection and exposure with cryptographic techniques.
* **Increase accessibility:** Enable broader participation in financial services.
* **Promote transparency:** Establish clear and verifiable KYC/AML protocols.

**Question:** 
1. Is it possible to built feature like this on Internet Computer by leveraging current tech stack ?
2. Does Dfinity already have this on their plan? Or is there any project in the ecosystem currently working on this?
