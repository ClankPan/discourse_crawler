Dear IC community:

During this week's rollout of the latest replica version, we experienced a problem with subnet uzr34. At this point, II and the exchange rate canister (XRC) are affected. We are working to resolve the issue shortly â€” please be patient and keep checking [this page](https://status.internetcomputer.org/incidents/79gx2q81y90h) for more information as the situation develops.

Thanks.

What I'm particularly interested in, and I'm sure others are too, is understanding exactly what went wrong in each incident and how the issues were resolved. Having detailed post-mortem reports for these events would be extremely valuable. Thank you.

Yes of course, we always share post mortems after any incident, but it takes some time to prepare so it'll come soon.
