The following is a DoS attack vector:

- Notice that a user or a group of users uses a given subnet.
- Keep creating new canisters and use their memory, until creation of a new canister in this subnet becomes impossible.

So, the user after this won't be able to use memory resources of "his" subnet.

Proposed defense: Allow to create a subnet with a set of "controllers". Only controllers would be able to create a new canister on the subnet. Controllers also are able to change the set of controllers.

There is already such a mechanism. [This function](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai#get_principals_authorized_to_create_canisters_to_subnets) on the CMC shows the mapping of which principal is allowed to target which subnet

How is this mapping decided?

By proposals. I don't remember which topic they're under
