I like Nix and try to use it on all of my projects these days. This sometimes results in me adapting some existing tools and dependencies to fit in with my workflow.

I wrote this about a year and a half ago and have been iterating on it ever since. It works for my use case and hopefully for others too.

The latest version of the SDK it supports is a little bit behind but it’s designed to quite easily support adding newer versions. I’ll probably add a newer version soon unless someone beats me to it.

Thanks to @nomeata for encouraging me to finally make this public.

I added support for 0.8.4 earlier today.
