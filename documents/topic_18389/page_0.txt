Hello everyone. 

The March blockchain conferences at University of Oxford include Internet Computer sessions, and a soon-to-be-announced hackathon (when the IC hackathon is announced I'll post a separate message about that).

Speakers include faculty & researchers from Oxford, MIT, United Nations, DFINITY (see Dieter's sessions on day 3), University of Zurich, University of Basel, and others (see "Agenda" for the list of approx. 30 speakers and topics). 

Please do notice that the "Experience" option closes at the end of this month, however, and so if you want to stay in the official Oxford accommodation or attend the formal dinner you'll need to register by March 1st.

Cheers,
Aaron
