On my OS  I updated to node 14.x.
To use random base package I needed to upgrade to 0.6.16 from 0.6.14. 
After upgrading to 0.6.16 and updating the dfx.json "dfx start" raised errors and didn't start.
I needed to create a new dir, run dfx new and copy the src to get it working again...
the dfx new state things like 
npm WARN deprecated chokidar@2.1.8: Chokidar 2 will break on node v14+. Upgrade â ‰ Installing node dependencies...
these things are missing on the projects created with 0.6.14.
at least I was not able to fix this in a different way than creating a new project and copy the old stuff...
