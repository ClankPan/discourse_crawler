Hello everyone,

I'm relatively new to developing on the Internet Computer and have been trying to upload files to a canister I created using the nns.ic0.app website. However, I've run into a few issues and could use some help.

Here's what I've done so far:

* Created a canister on nns.ic0.app and funded it with cycles.
* Tried to start the canister using `dfx canister start --network=ic [canister-id]` but encountered errors related to controller permissions.
* Fixed the permissions issue by adding my principal ID as a controller using the web interface.
* Attempted to deploy my files using `dfx deploy --network=ic`, but received errors indicating the canister ID could not be found.

Is there a specific workflow or set of commands that I should follow to properly upload files to an existing canister? Any detailed guidance or steps would be greatly appreciated!

You need to tell the project how the canister name maps to the principal. This work with the `canister_ids.json` file. Have a look [here](https://github.com/dfinity/cycles-ledger/blob/main/canister_ids.json) for an example
