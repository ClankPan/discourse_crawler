Hello All,

We are happy to [propose an upgrade to the NNS Dapp canister](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=126734):

### Added

* Sns dynamic voting proportions.
* Iterator over AccountsDbs.
* Display expiration date for sns proposals.
* Neuron type support.
* Card with BTC deposit address and QR code in ckBTC wallet.
* Merge Approve transfer with BTC "Sent" transaction in transaction list.
* Display Neurons' Fund commitment progress bar.
* `range()` method to `AccountsDbTrait`.
* Render ckBTC Reimbursement transactions.

### Changed

* Render BTC deposits/withdrawals as "BTC Received"/"BTC Sent".
* Update Rust version: `1.74.0` -> `1.74.1`
* Provide space for migration state in the `ProxyDb`.
* Rename "Launch Pad" to "Launchpad".

### Fixed

* Limit the size of proposal payload rendering errors, as otherwise the error can become too large to return.
* Provide a fallback if proposal payloads don't have the expected type.
* Temporary work-around for broken SNS.

### Security

* Bump css-tools dev dependency to fix minor vulnerability.
