Hi all, the explorer - https://www.dfinityexplorer.org/#/ , as one can read it, is a work in progress. Is there a timeline of its completion? If yes, please share.

Another issue, what are the system hardware requirements(RAM, storage, etc) to spin up a rosetta node? Is there a way for ICP integration with exchanges without rosetta? When will those docs become available?

Thanks...!!!

Hi @Vishal! DFINITY Explorer is a community project. I plan to add features to it over time.

Also check out https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org, which has block explorer functionality (transactions, accounts) that DFINITY Explorer is currently lacking.

I can't help you with the Rosetta questions. I assume you've already read this, but I'll put it here just in case:

How do I query for a block here?
