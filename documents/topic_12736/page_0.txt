Hi - I wanted to try out the NFT Studio application, but I got a security warning from Avast.
I went to https://dfinity.org/showcase/?tag=nft and clicked on "NFT Studio" link and I got the warning shown in the screen print attached.
Has anyone else had this happen? What did you do? What is the problem?
Maybe IC addresses are automatically blocked by Avast?
