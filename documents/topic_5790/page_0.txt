I have deployed the demo counter app to the IC ...

https://b4w7y-yyaaa-aaaah-qac4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/

... now after running ...

dfx canister --network ic install --all --mode upgrade

..... and receiving what seems like good logs and no errors (see below), when i refresh the above link the app is still not updating / showing the changes that i have made.

1. is the above the correct command
2. Is there anyway to see what's deployed to the canister

thks

Hmmmmâ€¦did you try deploy instead of install? What version of dfx?

Ok so ....

 dfx deploy --network ic

.... worked fine and i noticed in the logs it seems to use upgrade for the canisters ...

Upgrading code for canister slp_ui, with canister_id b4w7y-yyaaa-aaaah-qac4q-cai

... ill double check my service canister to see if it has lost the state.

My version is 0.7.0 .

So just to confirm ...

dfx canister --network ic install --all --mode upgrade

.... should work ?

That should work, but be sure to run `dfx build` to compile the code first.

Here are a couple good docs on the topic:

Working with Canisters 
https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/working-with-canisters.html

Info page for `dfx canister`

ok cool, 

My locally dev process is working fine - just had this little issue with re deploying to the ic.

This looks to have fixed it, so thanks for all the feedback.
