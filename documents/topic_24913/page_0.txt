As I currently understand it, an http outcall will be sent multiple times from different nodes in the subnet.
The issue is that if I am to query a service whose URL address is restricted by geo-location then the nodes will not get the same response and the request will fail.
Is there (or should there be) a way to require only specific geo located nodes to participate in the outcall request?

There is no such option right now. It would be hard to do that on a "regular" subnet since subnet membership changes periodically. There are plans to introduce geographic-based subnets, like a European subnet. This might solve the problem if you place your canister in such a subnet and the location of nodes matches the remote service requirement.
So I am sorry, but I do not have an immediate solution.
