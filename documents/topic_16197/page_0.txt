Questions about converting ICP into Cycles (Gas)

Local development environment

Can I emulate in a local environment the full cycle of financing canisters

Very brief logic of actions:

1) Users deposit ICP (to their wallet)

2) The user dissolves them (ICP) in cycles

3) Selects destination canisters and finances them in cycles.

At the moment I realized that it is necessary (for me) to create support cans in the local network

Exactly this one:

And if possible:

https://icscan.io/canister/rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai

Can you tell me where to get the sources for compilation and deployment. Or is that not enough?

In the [developer docs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup) it is described how to set up the ledger locally, and this can be done for other ledger canisters too.
[This](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/f4ec163ac968ab94550c01b949a78fd4b8af61ce/scripts/update-nns.bash) is the script we use to set up the full NNS canister set locally for DFX's CI, including a patch that allows setting the cycles <> XDR rate locally instead of by NNS proposal; we then use it in [these tests](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/f4ec163ac968ab94550c01b949a78fd4b8af61ce/e2e/tests-dfx/ledger.bash#L26-L33).
The one thing you can't do is deploy a canister through the NNS, since it expects subnets to exist and on the local replica they do not exist. However, I *think* you can mint cycles to a canister already created through `dfx canister create`.
