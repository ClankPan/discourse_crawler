On June 21, the Japanese government announced an authentication app for KYC (Know Your Customer) of Japanese citizens. For the Relying Party of this authentication app, a signature using secp256r1 (ES256) is mandatory to prove one's identity.

If tECDSA could support secp256r1 as well, the use of ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) would likely advance in Japan. Outside of Japan, in the world of identity, secp256r1 is also essential.

Could we request support for secp256r1 as well?
