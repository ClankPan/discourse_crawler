Hi Dfinity programming team. 
I am not sure where to ask for....
Is there a way to hide inactive, unlocked and empty (0 ICP) neurons from our account?
Every time we spawn a new reward ICP, it create a new neurons with 7 days dissolve delay.  After 7 days, when we transfer the ICP from it, it becomes unlocked and empty.  This accumulate empty many neurons if done regularly and becomes very annoying.
OR having a new tab where all unlocked & empty neurons are stored automatically, or have an option:  Hide unlocked and empty neurons.  Thank you.
