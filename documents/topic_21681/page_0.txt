Is there a way to set the controllers of a canister without using the dfx commands? Perhaps defining any additional controllers in the dfx.json file.

I'd like to start up the project with fixed-defined controllers for my canister.

I dont think there is a way to define controllers in dfx.json.
But there can be multiple different ways, like : 
1. Use NNS dapp to add controllers to canisters (but your nns principal must be the controller of that canister).
2. Using IC Management canister's update-settings method, to add controller to a canister, only condition is whoever run this method of IC Management canister, has to be the controller of canister.
