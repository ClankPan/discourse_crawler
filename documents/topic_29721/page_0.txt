Victor, 
We have twice sent you the code via a email attachment. You desire to develop an app, so you can follow the instructions we sent you. All you must do is edit your first post in this thread and paste the code that we attached (twice) to emails that we sent you. 
Please do this within the next week. Otherwise we will decline your application.

In your brief description, you mention that one of project dependencies is: "1. Availability of skilled developers proficient in blockchain development and AI technologies.". Does this mean you will not be the developer and you will need to look for someone else to develope it for you?

soloking | 2024-06-23 14:55:53 UTC | #11

I need another dev for help.
I will hire a person to help along with me

You did not post the entire code we sent you, so the reviews are not showing. They can be viewed [here](https://airtable.com/app9yb0aqQ3yOkjWO/shrcndT5DW07o1Nma).


This grant is declined.
