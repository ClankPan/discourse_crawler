Hello IC fam, ICPSwap team here! We want to express our gratitude for the incredible support and assistance from the IC fam!

ICPSwap is gearing up to launch its SNS DAO and is expected to commence decentralized swaps once key milestones are achieved.

Here are some critical elements of this journey. Please take a look:


**What is ICPSwap?**

ICPSwap stands as the native, pioneering, and premier Decentralized Exchange (DEX) within the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem, providing an extensive array of financial and market services. Our users and fans may immerse themselves in the ultimate Decentralized Finance (DeFi) experience, featuring a broad spectrum of token standards trading, dedicated staking pools, robust yield farming, innovative Claim features, and more. With ICPSwap, we are nearly exploring every facet of DeFi!

[SNS White Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16KtT63wNSXRCV9MAby09bl7oXTpl8k8B7V7wjQ8t6dM/edit?usp=sharing) 

[ICPSwap Onepager](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FsBTNDNUrvX9YkBpQetRZZMVocT5HgPj/view?usp=sharing) 

The sns_init.yaml file and audit report (We've successfully completed our SNS code audit with [Beosin](https://beosin.com/)） will be released soon.


**Proposed Token Distribution**

Total Supply: 1 billion ICS tokens

Initially distributed:

* 48%: Reserved for the ICPSwap DAO Treasury
* 26%: Allocated for swap to decentralize governance and raise funds for the SNS.
* 9%: Allocated to the ICPSwap team and advisors with a dissolve delay of 6 months. These neurons will be vested quarterly over a 48-month period following the SNS Swap, distributed equally each quarter
* 10%: Allocated to Seed Round investors, vesting over 24 months.
* 3%: Allocated to Strategic Round investors, vesting over 24 months.
* 4%: Allocated to Private Sale investors, vesting over 11 months.

Ledger transaction fee: 0.01 ICS token



**Governance**

Each participant in the decentralization swap (including the Neuron Fund) will receive their tokens in a basket of 5 ICS neurons of equal value, each with dissolve delays of 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively.

The ICPSwap team and advisors will receive their tokens in a basket of 16 neurons, each with a dissolve delay of 6 months. These neurons will vest quarterly over a 48-month period following the SNS Swap, with equal proportions each quarter. The team and advisors will not receive any ICS tokens at the SNS Swap.

Each Seed Round investor will receive tokens in the form of a basket of 24 equal-value neurons, each with a dissolve delay of 1 month. These neurons will vest over a 24-month period after the SNS swap, with equal proportions each month.

Each Strategic Round investor will receive tokens in the form of a basket of 24 equal-value neurons, with no dissolve delays. These neurons will vest over a 24-month period after the SNS swap, with equal proportions each month.

Each Private Sale investor will receive a basket of 12 tokens in the form of equivalent neurons. These neurons have no dissolve delays and will undergo linear unlocking from 0 to 11 months after the SNS swap, with equal proportions each month.

**SNS Swap**

26% of the total supply of ICS tokens is proposed to be distributed via an SNS decentralization swap.

DigitaSoja | 2024-02-17 22:10:17 UTC | #14

I am confused about this project. I love the project but this project has stolen tokens (ICP) from innocent ICP followers who wanted to use that platform.

About two different occasions I have lost my ICPs.
My good friend whom I invited to ICP also lost couple of Tokens.

The Support on Telegram is weak with lots of scams. People barely get  their tokens back after reporting to Support.

My point is this, How sure I am that this project is ready to be launched in the NNS?

Who else lost tokens but don’t have the right channels to express their frustration like I do?

Review that project before you bring it to the NNS and please pay back every canister that has lost a token.

Enjoy your weekend 

@DigitaSoja

Correction to the above post.

This is review of the above post made sometimes ago.
I want to say I was a bit hard in expressing my frustration. I understand my problems are solved and I hope other in similar situations got help to so we can all see the clean and better prospects we all supporting to see for this project.

ICPSwap did not steal my coins. I finally found my coin in a different wallet. 
This experience gave me some vital education on how the ICP ecosystem works per Wallet management and Transactions. Pretty cool.

I believe with this knowledge I help other users in telegram and other ICPSwap related platforms.

I like to thank @ICPSwap tech for the patience and dedication to figure the core of the trouble is.

Hello sir! You are welcome! And thank you so much for providing such detailed information- your effort is greatly appreciated and helps us assist you more effectively.

Based on the information you have shared, this must be your Account ID dbb46d9ec0d7330f3aef23e05157fc8f0933a1e5c91ea697a4b69a3d1a68f400
(from the address in the "to" field of the transaction hash you provided)

From the screenshot you provided, it shows that the transaction failed at the "Approve" stage. This means that your ICP tokens have not been deducted, which only occurs at the next step, the "deposit" phase.

Upon reviewing your account on the dashboard (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/dbb46d9ec0d7330f3aef23e05157fc8f0933a1e5c91ea697a4b69a3d1a68f400),
It is confirmed that your balance is 3.4373477 ICP, and there are no records of any transfers out (deductions) of your account. 
![image|690x329](upload://vFdSjMQXzgTZ59pEF2hTCjDl2Nw.jpeg)


P.S.  A helpful tip for your future transactions on ICPSwap: should you complete a transaction that reaches the 'deposit' stage and it completes, but fails to swap due to network issues or other reasons, you can always access your tokens at Reclaim:  https://app.icpswap.com/swap/reclaim

We hope you continue to have a wonderful, increasingly convenient, and profitable trading experience on ICPSwap! We value your participation in our community and look forward to providing you with ongoing support. 

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you very much!  Have a fantastic weekend ahead!

Best regards!

Based of your explanation, I should still have my token in my wallet.

I will share my wallet here.

Also, you spoke about reclaiming. The reclaim is empty, nothing to claim.

So, where can I find my token?
ICS stole it? Or show me where to find my tokens.

Your explanation above didn’t resolve the problem or provide any cause or recovery mechanism.

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-02-17 16:04:11 UTC | #19

Thanks for the reply, Sir. Please don't worry; let us solve your problem step by step.

Firstly, could you please confirm your Principal ID?

Secondly, which wallet are you using to connect to ICPSwap? Are you possibly using multiple wallet addresses but not switching between them? Based on the screenshot you provided earlier, in the top right corner, your Principal ID appears to be "uhtu ...rae". However, in your last reply, the Principal ID is "c4hn...jae".

Thanks for the reply! Sir!

So, is this "uhtu...rae" not your Principal ID? According to your feedback, the approval error occurred with this account. And our response also indicates that the ICP balance is still in this account.
![image|282x500](upload://exHFXE428JEZg88H5Mkm4y28VrW.png)


However, you later provided another Principal ID: "c4hn6-fis5f-4bzbh-zboly-pow5p-a6l6y-awhf5-hkc3n-tcw2v-7mu5g-jae." Is this another issue? or have you confused two wallet addresses that you own?

-------------------------

DigitaSoja | 2024-02-17 16:52:58 UTC | #22

I only sign in ICS with my internet ID,
The uhtu…rae, I don’t know what that is. And if the transaction was made on the ID, then the returned fund may be in that wallet.

I am look to see which wallet that it.

The address above is from ICS. I used that address to send ICP from OpenCHAT wallet to ICS.

Thank you for clarifying, sir.

You can log into this wallet (uhtu…rae), connect to ICPSwap, and you will find the ICP balance you mentioned inside.

I basically don’t know what that wallet is. But I will look around and find that wallet and give you a feed back.
Thank you for the support.

My second issue, why am I not legible to claim ICS rewards? I got the support team to help me on telegram but no success. Can you look into this for me?

Thanks.

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-02-17 17:54:01 UTC | #27

1/ Ok! Thank you, Sir!

2/ Based on your Principal "c4hn6....", I've checked, and yes, you have the ICS token airdrop eligible. However, the ICS tokens are not yet available, so you won't see them in your balance at the moment.

YOUR SUPPORT EXPERTISE ARE NEED IN TELEGRAM.

The statement above is to accolade you for your great expertise in troubleshooting and resolving ICS problems.

I have found my lost token in Stoic wallet. I never signed in with that wallet but I can remember I used that wallet sometimes ago when trying to claim nft airdrop on ICS.

However the coin got there I don’t know but the good thing is that, you helped me find my coins.

Thank you.

Thank you so much, Sir! It's great to hear that we've resolve your issue!

Sometimes, messages on Telegram pass by quickly, and your question might be complex, cannot be explained clearly in one or two sentences, so your problem cannot be completely solved at that time. We apologize for any inconvenience, and we will continue to improve our support. In the future, if you encounter more technical issues, you can provide additional background information via "contact@icpswap.org" to receive more personalized assistance.

Once again, thank you for your support! Have a fantastic weekend ahead!

I’m really glad to see that your problem was resolved.  It was nice to see you express appreciation for the assistance you received here.  Would you please consider editing your prior comments where you accused the ICP Swap of stealing ICP while labeling yourself as a Researcher ICP Investor?  It seems like the right thing to do since @ICPSwap spent so much time troubleshooting your problem.  That way other people will know from the beginning of the thread that you are not making false accusations, but instead are just seeking help.

@ICPSwap 
**Is the source code for the front end open sourced?**

It is absolutely crucial for SNS that all canisters to be open sourced so that we can verify the code.

-------------------------

RayJoe | 2024-02-24 16:06:34 UTC | #35

It is not necessary, and front-end code changes and updates too frequently.

-------------------------

coin_master | 2024-02-24 17:03:51 UTC | #36

That is a false statement, please review the [SNS checklist] (https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/sns-checklist/#22-open-sourcing) again and adapt accordingly.

> 2. Technical prep & testing
> 2.2. Open sourcing
If the dapp is not already open sourced, it should be open sourced before the SNS launch - actually before the decentralisation proposals are created.

Hello IC fam, The [security audit report for ICPSwap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlwuTUOrecE9N73YapzVffy079YIi0uI/view?usp=sharing) and the [sns_init.yaml](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs/sns/blob/main/sns_init.yaml) updates are here. Please check! We'll open-source the code for ICPSwap next Monday. After the SNS, we'll continue to conduct regular security audits on the ICPSwap code to ensure the safety of user assets.

March 10th Update: 
The [backend code for ICPSwap](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs/icpswap-v3-service) has been open-sourced, and the frontend code will soon.

Hey IC fam, 

Yesterday, when we submitted the SNS proposal, we encountered a limitation regarding the number of developer neurons exceeding 100, causing the creation to fail. Upon consulting the DFINITY Foundation team, we received the response: "The problem with not having bounds is that then the SNS launch process might just hit some message size or cycles limits." As a result, we have readjusted the number of neurons.

Here are the adjustments made:

The team's allocation, previously consisting of 3 Principal IDs and 16*3 neurons, has been adjusted to 1 Principal ID and 4 neurons, maintaining a dissolve delay of 6 months and vesting periods of 1, 13, 25, and 37 months.

Seed investors' allocation, previously comprising 9 Principal IDs and 216 neurons, has been adjusted to 9 Principal IDs with 54 neurons, maintaining a dissolve delay of 1 month and vesting periods of 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 months.

Strategic investors' allocation, previously consisting of 4 Principal IDs and 96 neurons, has been adjusted to 4 Principal IDs with 24 neurons, maintaining vesting periods of 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 months.

Private investors' allocation, previously comprising 5 Principal IDs and 60 neurons, has been adjusted to 5 Principal IDs with 15 neurons, maintaining vesting periods of 0, 4, and 8 months.

There have been no changes to the initial voting power or other parameters. For more details, you can refer to the latest [sns_init.yaml](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs/sns/blob/main/sns_init.yaml)

Thank you for your support and help!

Antony | 2024-03-16 10:05:56 UTC | #43

Hi ICPSWAP TEAM,

I've identified a couple of issues within your open-source repository:

1. There are instances where the frontend code depends on private libraries, causing frontend builds to fail.
2. There appears to be a disparity between the open-source code and the live version of your project.

These discrepancies give off an unprofessional impression when reviewing your repository.
It would be prudent to address these issues transparently.

-------------------------

Hello, Antony!

Yes, you're right! Thank you so much for your review and reminders!

This is a quick response from the Devs team. They are currently working on the upgrade now. If there are any further updates, I will keep you posted:

1/ We'll check them out and open-source them in the future. And now the installation guide has been updated to the README file.

2/ Previously, we were using zipped WASM files, which caused discrepancies in the module hash. The result was the difference you mentioned between the source code and the live version. We are upgrading the canisters to ensure that the module hash of the live canisters matches that of the local ones.  We're using the compiled WASM files directly to resolve this issue.

Thanks a lot and wish you a wonderful weekend!

**Update: The upgrade is complete!**

 ICPSwap -
Congratulations on moving forward with the SNS vote / launchpad

There is now a number of exchanges on the ICP and to be honest they have a feel to them being corporate / boring, and they are not perhaps very appealing to typical retail traders. ICPSwap has a clean user interface, less corporate looking than others but at the same time perhaps not as appealing to a broad audience as exchanges on other chains.

There is as far as I am aware no cuddly fuzzy looking exchange on the ICP yet - so what is my suggestion? Change the UI with some teddybears, scratchy cats, rainbows, cookies or aligattors.
Perhaps its just me (its not just me) but people love trading on such AMM's, such as Spooky Finance or Pancake Swap.

I do believe this will increase your market share and volume, basically this idea although well known is worth millions in regards to free marketing, more than the amount you are raising on the SNS Swap. 

A mascot and a more iconic theme will assist as well on your social media reach. When a youtuber demonstrates AMM / exchange on ICP an endorfin rush theme will be more appealing to them, rather than choosing from several conservating looking AMM's.

Given that Dfinity has a space theme with a cute little space man, perhaps that concept is something ICPSwap could build upon, or cute Motoko Ghosts. ICPSwap could even go with a Bitcoin theme in order to attempt to draw from the Trillion dollar stagnant Bitcoin liquidity.

Such a AMM is where I would trade, and I believe most retail traders work the same, its very basic psycology, and its been proven time after time to work well. 

Take the meme coin market which I do not endorse, but eventually sometime in the future will reach billion dollar daily volumes, all that crowd is going to want to trade with the cool exchange and then you get deep liquidity. I think that is potentially a  good market segment for ICPSwap, because Helix and other upcoming exchanges may have an advantage on pro-traders and institutinal traders.

And.... you still get the (market makers) arbitrage volume.

Exchanges on ICP right now are not very appealing- but going to Pancake swap you get an endorfin rush. Its a model proven to be efficient and if you do not go with this idea, the next exchange wil and they will therefore have a clear advantage. 

Also..... this will give more value to the coins you are minting with the SNS swap. Perhaps ICPSwap could engage with the community with a reward program for the best mascot / theme and take it to a vote.

Thanks for the consideration, now please throw shoes at me

Hey sir! Your insights and suggestions are spot on! Thank you so much for your support and awesome ideas! We'll be throwing flowers your way instead of shoes, lol.

We've actually designed some t-shirts featuring elements from DFINITY & ICPSwap before. And our mascot is an octopus. As shown below:

Similar to your examples, DFINITY's cute little spaceman and Pancake's Cake mascot, using friendly characters and symbolic names helps users connect with familiar things to build recognition. Such a clever suggestion! Let's keep exploring how we can better integrate our mascot with our products!

Awesome - 
Thanks for the reply, I appreciate this! 

Please can I ask about tokenomics and technology:

1: Regarding the funding raised (ICP), is there a decision on how much to lock, and over how much time

2: It is my understanding that ICP Swap has developed a user interface for minting of tokens ("coins") but that this feature is not live, please correct me if I am wrong. What is the reason for holding back on this feature, and would the DAO be able to force through such implementation further down the line. 

The combination of UI for minting coins as well Farms as a Service would be perhaps a very valuable contribution to the broader ecosystem.

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-03-21 20:07:21 UTC | #56

Thank you very much! Of course, We are glad to answer your questions!

1/ Funds raised through SNS are stored in the DAO treasury. If there's a need to use them, a proposal needs to be submitted, outlining the purpose, etc. Then, ICS Neurons vote on it. Only after it's passed can the funds be used.

2/ Yes, we did have a feature for minting tokens, in a test version. At that time, the ICRC token standard hadn't been released yet, Token standards had not been unified yet, on the other hand, there wasn't SNS to engage the community in whether to open this feature or what potential risks might be. We have a plan to relaunch this feature after SNS, offering token minting using the ICRC standard. However, we'll also submit a proposal first and let the community participate in deciding on this matter.

Thank you so much for your insights!

Team, sorry if this sounds stupid but I'm new to this kind of stuff. What I noticed on the launchpad is that the following persons are excluded from current launch: US, KP, CU, SD, SY, IR, VE, CN.

Does it mean that US users can't contribute at all?

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-03-22 14:27:32 UTC | #58

Hey sir! Thanks for reaching out!

We apologize for the inconvenience! This is made as per legal compliance and risk management considerations. Countries like the United States have strict regulations on crypto, and we must ensure our activities comply with relevant laws and regulations. 

In fact, in terms of the industry practices, many blockchain projects also adopt similar strategies and criteria, and we just follow such set of standards. 

Thank you for your understanding. Hope you will have fun and expected rewards on ICPSwap!

-------------------------

Julian | 2024-03-22 16:41:40 UTC | #59

Thanks guys! I'm in fact not a US resident but when I see that US and China, 2 of the biggest markets are blocked from participating, it's a bit weird. Anyway, I'm not fully acquainted with this whole environment and regulations so I'll ask around, just to double check. Thanks again

I know many people use VPN so that it's all available.
This is quite normal in cryptos...

I like the “fun” branding ideas for the swap apps. I was thinking “Wife Swap” after all ICP is wife-changing money. That’s the name, that’s our motto. I love it - don’t tell my wife haha.

-------------------------

ICPSwap | 2024-04-07 06:36:54 UTC | #63

We DID it! 🎉

Huge thanks to the amazing IC Fam for your ongoing support and encouragement. We're experiencing a new beginning, much like a phoenix rising from the ashes, with a brighter future ahead!

ICPSwap is now officially part of the SNS DAO! We're thrilled to join the expanding ICP DAOs ecosystem. Let's keep building together! https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/sns/csyra-haaaa-aaaaq-aacva-cai
