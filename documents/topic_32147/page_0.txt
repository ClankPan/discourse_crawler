I am developing using WSL on Windows through VSCode.

I'm having trouble with the directions on this page: [https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/samples/motoko/auth_client_demo/](https://auth_client_demo)

My first error is when I run `dfx deps deploy`.
Steps:
0. git clone
1. dfx start
2. dfx deps pull
3. dfx deps deploy
4. npm i --legacy-peer-deps
5. dfx deploy

At this point im no longer sure what to do.

Thanks for the report - there were some inconsistent dependency versions in that example. I've fixed it and tested all the flows, and the updated version of the package will be available once this PR goes through:
