I seem to see integration with Bitcoin.

diegop | 2022-05-20 17:26:10 UTC | #3

Yes last few releases have been adding more and more features related to Bitcoin integration

These sounds really interesting. Any chance you can explain what they do? I'm not sure I understand what "idle consumption rate" and "new heartbeat code" refer to.

> * Networking: Canister http client setup

Is this for the feature that allows canisters to make external HTTP requests?

[/quote]

Yes. This is related to that feature that allows canisters to make outgoing HTTP requests. But there is more work that needs to come into the feature before it becomes generally available.

@levi Thanks so much for reporting a mismatch. Let's try to get to the bottom of it.
We tested it on 4 independent machines at DFINITY for this release, but I'm now retrying on a completely new (clean) machine that I personally own, at my home.

Can you please try to rebuild with these commands, to avoid possible issues with some stale data:
```
docker image prune -a
docker builder prune
git fetch
git checkout b90edb9897718730f65e92eb4ff6057b1b25f766
git clean -ffdx
./gitlab-ci/tools/docker-build-ic
```

UPDATE: local rebuilding just finished on one of my personal (home) machines with the expected checksums:
```
IC-OS Image
1a5b1477f0c9001f82623f81679fbe80f773d3ae76c50b95f04f58b367c384e5 *update-img-test.tar.gz
50b59237df70d50b77af06b8c6737585cb5490b276a81d3797e6310a11c6fbd1 *update-img.tar.gz
```

The machines in question run Ubuntu 20.04 with the latest updates.
```
$ cat /etc/lsb-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS"

```

It would help if you could provide similar info from your side.

> > * Execution: Add idle consumption rate to canister status 

The idle consumption rate in this commit refers to the idle rate consumption of resources that the canister is using, and it could be used to compute the freezing threshold in cycles. 
 
> > * Execution: Use new heartbeat code 

The second change refers to a refactoring needed for deterministic time slicing, which is a work in progress.

@levi, thank you for providing this information. The differences on Fedora happen due to Btrfs filesystem. I've compared the image I get from Fedora 36 with default configuration and I got the same SHA cryptographic digest as you and the differences seen on the images showed that the directories have different hard link count. Btrfs is differnt with that by design.

We will take note of this and improve our utility script. Until then, please verify the build on Ubuntu 20.04 machine. You can do so using one of the public cloud providers and feeding the following cloud-config:
```
#cloud-config
apt:
  sources:
    docker.list:
      source: deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $RELEASE stable
      keyid: 9DC858229FC7DD38854AE2D88D81803C0EBFCD88

packages:
  - sudo
  - git
  - apt-transport-https
  - ca-certificates
  - curl
  - gnupg-agent
  - software-properties-common
  - docker-ce

system_info:
  default_user:
    name: ubuntu
    sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
    primary_group: ubuntu
    groups: docker
    shell: /bin/bash

runcmd:
  - sudo -u ubuntu git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic.git /home/ubuntu/ic
  - sudo -u ubuntu bash -c "cd ~/ic && git fetch && git checkout b90edb9897718730f65e92eb4ff6057b1b25f766"
  - sudo -u ubuntu bash -c "cd ~/ic && CI_DISPOSABLE_ENVIRONMENT=true ./gitlab-ci/tools/docker-build-ic"
```
If you save that under `/tmp/cloud-config.yaml`, you can make the build on AWS with the following command:
```
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-02584c1c9d05efa69 --region eu-central-1 --count 1 --instance-type c3.4xlarge --key-name <key> --block-device-mappings 'DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={VolumeSize=100}' --user-data file:///tmp/cloud-config.yaml
```
AMI is official Ubuntu image.

Thank you again for providing this information, we will improve our validation utility script and instructions so this doesn't happen again. Please let me know if this doesn't clear your doubts or concerns or if you have any questions about it.

@marko thanks for looking into this. I'll try to verify the build on ubuntu using a bootable usb on my machine. 
I'll keep an eye out for the build to match on Fedora.

Hi @levi. I'm sharing the snippet with which you can see I got the same SHA digest on Fedora 36 as you did and with which you can see the exact differences that happen due to Btrfs.

Oops, this was supposed to be a DM…my apologies.

Hey Levi.  I just wanted to reach out again to see if we could discuss replica version management proposal topics.  

Do you review them on a regular basis?  If so, do you publicly share your voting neuron ID?  I be happy to promote your work in my communications for the CodeGov project.  I think it’s important for many people and organizations to participate in these reviews.

If you have any interest in participating in these reviews with the CodeGov project, then please let me know.  It would be awesome to have you on our team of reviewers.  The commitment is very flexible.

However, my main interest is just learning who in the IC ecosystem is making any type of effort to review code changes and to encourage more of it.  I would love to chat with you more about this topic.

Thanks,
Wenzel
