Has anyone built a relational database canister or know of an example of one? I'm building a blog website, and that would save me some time.

Haven't used it myself but there is a [sqlite port](https://github.com/HassenSaidi/IC_sqlite) you could try. You could also checkout this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2XnywvwxFM&list=PLuhDt1vhGcrfQGLWqhUo9-DFD5JaHqCh1) if you want to get an idea of how to build a canister with basic CRUD operations in motoko.

Not a canister, but it is a Webassembly SQL database done in Rust meant for the front-end(browser). I'm looking into a database canister myself, and that library is the best I have found of an example of what a canister database might look like.

@spencer: IC_SQLite should do the job. It is a bit annoying to use right now as the return type of a query call is a string containing a printout of the result. So you will have to parse the result yourself based on the columns you expect in your query result. I will modify it to be able to specify a buffer of type X. Let me know if you run into issues playing with it.

Have you looked into using this with stable storage?

Sudograph (disclosure my project) is an implementation of a relational database with GraphQL as the query language: https://github.com/sudograph/sudograph
