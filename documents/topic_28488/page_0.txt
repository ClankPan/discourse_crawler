Folks,

We have decided to not submit a proposal for electing a new IC OS version this week.

Earlier this week, we discovered a non-reproducibility issue (which, fortunately, is now well on its way to being diagnosed and fixed).  This issue manifests in the HTTP outcalls canister, whose build output currently results in different checksums from time to time.  Since the canister is part of the IC OS release, this cascades into affecting the reproducibility of the IC OS release.

We cannot in good faith ship an IC OS release that cannot be reproduced independently by the IC community.  Therefore, we have decided to postpone the release to next week.  To ensure that we discover non-reproducibility issues sooner, we’re also improving our testing stack to test reproducibility in more diverse environments.

For transparency purposes, what follows *would* have been the release notes for this cycle’s release.  We’re eager to bring all these improvements to you — and more — in next week’s cycle.

Thanks for sharing, let us know if we can help with anything.

I'm happy to report that we are making progress identifying the source of the nonreproducibility.  I can't say for sure when the problem will be solved because I don't want to risk sounding premature — but we will soon update with more information.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2024-03-18 12:07:28 UTC | #4

I noticed that the p2p version still got released according to https://github.com/dfinity/ic/releases/tag/release-2024-03-14_23-01-p2p  . Is that just for testing ?

-------------------------

dmanu | 2024-03-18 12:26:16 UTC | #5

Keen eye!  It got branched and tagged, but no proposals will be submitted to adopt it.

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2024-03-26 15:48:25 UTC | #6

Hey, any update on this ? Tried to replicate the issue and couldn't built it 12 times on different specs all built successfully and hashes matched. But then again with the latest release from this Friday managed to build it with no issues and even though nothing changed just a simple re proposal for the explained issues, last night and today I failed 5 times with the HostOS hash mismatch. Rest of the team  managed to re build it normally.
