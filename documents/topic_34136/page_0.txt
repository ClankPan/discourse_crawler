Hi again! I had a call to a developer and can advance in my API. This is an Node + Express API to consume Minter and Ledger canisters from a wallet, only for ckBtc transactions.

I already created addresses, and try to send some ckBtc from [nns ic wallet](nns.ic0.app/) and it already works. I try 2 transactions sending 1000 satoshis and both works, if i user de ledger `icrc1_balance_of` I get a response `2000n`. But when i try to approve some amount to transfer, y get an "insufficient balance" and "balance: 0" for response.

What I am missing?
