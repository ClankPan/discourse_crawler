Happy Monday!

Today we've released a new minor version of the agent-js suite including the following changes:

We advise users using the new `fromPem` method to exercise caution in any circumstance where users are transporting an unencrypted pem file, but this will make it easier for tool builders and for people to manage identities during CI.

Additionally, the new watermark feature will have the agent check the latest certified watermark when making queries. If a query comes back from a node that is behind, the agent will retry until it gets a query back that is past the latest `read_state` request. This will cut down on users getting back stale data.

This could not have happened at a more ideal time, I was literally just trying to figure out how to create an identity from a pem file! 

Works great! Thank you so much
