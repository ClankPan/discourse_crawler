Right now I am not sure when `dfx build` call the `npm build` npm script. It would be nice to be able to provide `pre-build` and `post-build` scripts, because as part of your own build process you might want to deal with the generated code that `dfx build` gives you. I am not sure if I can rely on my build process running after `dfx` generates that code. This is related to complications describe here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/allow-configuring-the-location-of-the-dfx-generated-code-for-asset-canisters/2441
