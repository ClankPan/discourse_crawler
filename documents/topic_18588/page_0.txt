Due to the vague future in light of WW III harbingers and its reflection on economic matters. I think we should start to expand IC nodes provider very fast to keep IC operational and a good alternative to traditional Web2 services providers which will be severely affected by the upcoming war.

It is difficult to install high tech and complex systems to be node provider in that situation.

My idea is to create a small computer that can fit the hand with USB access and medium tech ability to run as a node provider, just need an internet connection and become a node provider.

I hope this ideaðŸ’¡ become true one day.
