There was a [ransom attack](https://therecord.media/niconico-japan-video-streaming-site-cyberattack) in Japan that took over a month to resume service provision. Details are still unknown, but it was a persistent attack that forced us to not only cut off the server connection but also physically cut off the power supply. There was one host machine, and it is unclear if there were any backups. If there were backups, it doesn't seem like it would have been a very long road to resumption, and there may be some problem with the backups.
My understanding of the public subnet and UTOPIA concept is that there should be multiple host machines and data replication to withstand such a cyber attack, spin up when the host machine is attacked, and maximum measures in place to avoid service outages like this one.
This is a characteristic of ICP that other chains do not have, and I think it would be good if ICP could appeal this point more. On the other hand, cyber attacks and their countermeasures are a game of two halves, and even the best countermeasures cannot be perfect because attacks can be launched from different places, so ICP's appeal from a cyber attack perspective is difficult and needs some work. I think the way to appeal ICP from the viewpoint of cyber attack is difficult and needs to be devised. I would like to know if there is a good way around this.

Thank you. I believe emphasizing high security will appeal not only to crypto enthusiasts but also to enterprises. [Dom has also been speaking from this perspective more frequently](https://x.com/dominic_w/status/1802547007678017723). Understanding cybersecurity is challenging and not many outside of experts show much interest, but I think it’s extremely important.
