The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals today, 2024-02-02. DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## Additional Notes

A `message` field has been added to NNS Governance's MakeProposalResponse. Currently, it informs the user that their proposal has been created successfully. In the future, this field will be populated with any information that is relevant to the proposer. Frontends that allow users to create NNS proposals should display it, but not depend on it having any particular structure other than being markdown-formatted text.

Dear @Andre-Popovitch,

I take advantage of your announcement to ask this : *Do you plan to add a feature to allow any staker to create proposals directly from the NNS frontend (I mean by a staker simply connecting to NNS with their Internet Identity) ?*

I know that some tools provided by third parties already exist, but I am wondering if it is not a necessity to eventually integrate this directly within the frontend in order to reach the ideal of a ***D***ao : allow everyone to propose something, even without any skill in coding/developing, etc. But I am not sure yet.

 Marketingly, at least, it could : people would think, "I will be able to do things that I can't do in my own country : *directly cast proposals*. So I want to stake some ICP"

-------------------------

@Roman Thank you for your question. It is something we would love to add but as far as I know it is not currently prioritized.

It's not nearly as nice as NNS dapp integration would be, but [ic-admin](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/ic-admin) is officially supported, and for users familiar with the command line, can be straightforwardly used to submit proposals. (Although I think it doesn't yet support some of the newest SNS proposals.)
