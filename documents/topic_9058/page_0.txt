# Background
> Motoko is the world's most advanced [smart contract language](https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1421521193258176512?s=20).

Also is a new, modern and type safe language. In addition, it is developer-friendly and specifically designed to support the unique features of the Internet Computer, and so on.

Same as other new languages, it only has some basic libraries, and many useful libraries are not implemented, and this has become an obstacle for some developers to use it. e.g. 
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-verify-a-messages-signature-in-motoko/7961/5?u=flyq
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/icdevs-org-bounty-4-uuid-motoko-library/8648

Therefore, it is necessary to promote the development of the motoko library in the form of an open source organization

# What is it
Motoko unofficial is an open source organization whose sole purpose is to empower and promote the Motoko language.

The specific things are:

1. Maintain an [awesome motoko](https://github.com/motoko-unofficial/awesome-motoko) list with the community, and look forward to the community recommending more excellent motoko libraries
2. Listen to the needs of project parties who use motoko as a development language in the IC ecosystem, and contact more Motoko developers to develop related libraries.
3. Other things that can enhance and promote the Motoko language.
