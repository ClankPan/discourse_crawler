As I told in [my previous question](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-generate-did-files-for-an-actor-class/21468), I need to generate TypeScript API for my actor class that is not included into `dfx.json` (because it is to be created by other Motoko code, not directly by DFX).

I figured out how to create the `*.did` file. But how to create the rest TS/JS code?

This is the files that DFX generates and I need to generate having only source and `.did` file (not by DFX):

- `*.did`
- `*.did.d.ts`
- `*.did.js`
- `*.d.ts`
- `*.js`

`dfx deploy` has some `Post processing candid file` stage. Apparently, it is what I need.

How to run this stage manually (for a canister not specified in `dfx.json`)? I don't know which command to use for this.

You can use `didc bind --target ts`. didc can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/dfinity/candid/releases)

For what is worth, I add those types of canister to my `dfx.json` configuration as well. That way it generates the types automatically. I just have to not care about the fact they fail at deploy locally but the advantage, is that all my commands (`cargo test` and `npm run generate`) remains to same to generate the types no matter what.

Alternatively, we got a script in `ic-js` that generates types from `did` files: https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/blob/main/scripts/compile-idl-js
