# Summary

This is the proposal for the NNS to create an SNS DAO to govern the IC GHOST.

# Purpose

IC GHOST is the first meme coin and one of the leading projects within the ICP ecosystem!

At IC GHOST, we are deeply committed to realizing the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and fostering a community driven by selflessness and dedication. With the launch of our SNS-DAO, we embrace the spirit of collective decision-making and invite our community to actively participate in shaping the future of our project. Together, let's harness the power of DAO!

Through this strategic move, we are relinquishing control and entrusting the leadership and governance of the IC GHOST project to you, our valued community members. Our decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) empowers each individual within the community to play an active role in shaping the direction and success of IC GHOST.

We are committed to creating tangible value for all ICP users. Our ultimate goal is to establish a fully decentralized and self-governing organization where every $GHOST holder becomes a respected stakeholder, contributing to the growth and prosperity of the project.

Together, let's pave the way for a new era of decentralization and community-driven innovation. Join us on this exciting journey and be part of shaping the future of IC GHOST!

Every penny from SNS sales will be used for the liquidity of GHOST/ICP, which will be added through proposals.

# Proposed Token Distribution

Total token supply: 10 billion GHOST tokens

Token distribution:

* 75.92%: Reserved for the SNS treasury & under control of the IC GHOST DAO. A portion of it is allocated for a 1:1 exchange between GHOST (EXT) and GHOST (ICRC1).
* 20%: To be distributed by the NNS run decentralization sale, Every penny from here will be used for the liquidity of GHOST/ICP, which will be added through proposals.
* 4.08%: Allocated to the IC GHOST team which vests 1 year

Ledger transaction fee: 1 GHOST token

For more information on the token allocation please read [here](https://twitter.com/ghost_icp/status/1666075446751145986).

# Governance

Each decentralization sale participant will receive their tokens in neurons with dissolve delays is 0

Why is the dissolve delay set to 0? Firstly, this decision was made based on the request of the IC GHOST community users. Secondly, we want to avoid imposing mandatory governance on users. Instead, we encourage active participation from IC GHOST users. Once the sale is completed, and token conversion is finalized, every GHOST token holder can stake their tokens through https://nns.ic0.app/neurons and gains voting rights to participate in the DAO governance of IC GHOST.

The IC GHOST team will receive their tokens in neurons with a 1 year dissolve delay.

The governance parameters for IC GHOST are proposed to be initially set as:

* Min stake: 10,000 GHOST tokens
* Min staking period for voting: 7 Days
* Max staking period: 1 Year
* Voting Rewards: 1.25% of GHOST token supply minted annually

Max staking bonus (for 1 year): 1.25x Max age for age bonus: 6 months Max age bonus: 1.25x These parameters can be verified by querying the governance canister's get_nervous_system_parameters method at https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/6nh4s-5yaaa-aaaaq-aaaxq-cai

# Decentralization Sale

20% of the total supply of tokens are proposed to be distributed via an SNS decentralization sale. If the proposal is adopted, the sale will start after the specified delay. If the maximum number of ICP configured below is raised before that date the sale will conclude earlier.

Sale participation parameters:

* Min participation: 1 ICP
* Max participation: 100 ICP
* Max to be raised: 20,000 ICP
* Min to be raised: 10,000 ICP
* From Community Fund: 0 ICP
* Min participants: 100
* Sale due: 1 week
* Sale delay: 0

The sale is open to anyone. Participation is either via the launchpad in the NNS front end: https://nns.ic0.app/ or on the command line using quill.

# Ghost dapp

The Ghost platform consists of 3 dapp canisters.

* IC GHOST official website canister: `yadjb-mqaaa-aaaan-qaqlq-cai`
* IC GHOST NFT Collection canister: `xzcnc-myaaa-aaaak-abk7a-cai`
* IC GHOST Token (EXT) canister: `fjbi2-fyaaa-aaaan-qanjq-cai`
* sns_governance: `6nh4s-5yaaa-aaaaq-aaaxq-cai`
* sns_index: `46y7s-vaaaa-aaaaq-aaaza-cai`
* sns_ledger: `4q2s2-oqaaa-aaaaq-aaaya-cai`
* sns_root: `6kg2g-qaaaa-aaaaq-aaaxa-cai`
* sns_swap: `4x3uo-diaaa-aaaaq-aaayq-cai`

Lets be honest..  Every ecosystem needs a memecoin by definition. Joy & fun can bring a lot of interest that turns after in new developers and users coming to the ecosystem. This guys have shown over a year that they've been honest. Plus I like the NFTs. 
Thus, i'm voting yes.

Joy & fun For those who buy before, for those who buy later, it's sad and it's not fun. Without earning money, what would be the fun for the project?

Let's use SNS for non-MEME projects please.

Vote no, excuse me, I don't want to sound bad, I just prefer the SNS for other types of projects...

At genesis, the dissolve delay for sale participant neurons is set to zero, while the dissolve delay for the single dev neuron is set to one year. This configuration implies that the SNS is not decentralized at launch. Solely the dev neuron will hold voting power, and as such, it could potentially be used to transfer treasury funds.

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-06 15:50:16 UTC | #6

We understand your concerns and appreciate you pointing this out. However, allow us to clarify some key aspects.

Firstly, even though at the initial stage, the dissolve delay for the team neuron is set to one year, it is important to note that community members have their neurons without a dissolve delay, meaning they are free to stake their tokens thereby amplifying community governance.

Secondly, the one-year dissolve delay on our team's neuron is a clear commitment to the community: we have a long-term belief in this project. We firmly believe that our objectives align with those of the community within this period - that of building a robust, fair, and transparent decentralized community.

Lastly, we will always respect and protect the interests of the community. We would never undertake actions that harm or potentially erode the trust of the community. This is our principle and our pledge.

Thank you again for your scrutiny; we welcome and appreciate all such discussions as they are crucial to our progress.

I’m curious what the monetary value of launching a token on the SNS is? 

Dragginz took over the SNS-1 Dao because they wanted to be an SNS Dao and bought their way in instead of jumping through the hurdles (proposals/voting). I can’t recall how much they spent to gain access to the SNS.

Ghost wants an SNS and wants to raise 10,000 ICP. Is Ghost a $50,000 market cap before an SNS or because it’s an SNS Dao is it a $1,050,000 hypothetically.

It seems like SNS has intrinsic value that isn’t priced in. 

For examples Cig Dao would like people to launch  DAO’s on their platform. Catalyze seem like they want to go down this road to and have projects launch on its platform.  I assume for good reason. There is value in the SNS and I don’t think 🤔 it’s reflected correctly in the market cap of the projects that have launched on the SNS already. Maybe I’m wrong.

But if just by launching on the SNS that monetary value for a project is created - it seems like all projects no matter how big or small would want to launch in the SNS.

So if value is created by launching on the SNS shouldn’t we be charging fees to that project to do so, in addition to going through the normal proposals etc.

Edit: I would vote Yes to any project that is willing to pay the SNS launch fee in ICP that we would subsequently burn. Value is created for the project that launches on the SNS and value is created for ICP holders by burning the fee. Depending on how big the swap is, we could have a sliding scale of fees to charge. No project is too big or small. I voted no for Ghost SNS launch. But if they were going to pay a fee that would have been burned, I would have voted yes. There is nothing wrong with Ghost just the SNS. In my opinion. 
(Hot or Not is raising 1 Million ICP currently in the SNS, 1% swap fee or 10,000 ICP should be collected by the SNS post decentralization swap and burned for example)

Hello and thank you for your interest! We hold a strong belief in decentralized community-driven developments, and as such, we have chosen not to establish any "official" social channels. However, there are non-official communities where enthusiasts and supporters of $GHOST gather, share information, and engage in discussions. You can find these communities here: https://twitter.com/ghost_icp/status/1576958345545940992.

We also have a website where you can find more information about us: [http://icghost.org](http://icghost.org/).

While we encourage community interactions, please exercise caution and due diligence while participating in these platforms to avoid any potential scams or misinformation. Remember, our community is about trust, cooperation, and shared vision. Let's contribute positively to the growth and success of $GHOST together!

I dunno I was drunk.  Dragginz DAO started after a karaoke session with a load of germans.  Die Toten Hosen and Kraftwerk, good times.

The idea started when SNS-1 launched, I had 250 locked up for 100 years anyway just thought if I didn't do it somebody else would.

Thanks for respecting the opinion. The key is to invest in a project not just because you think you are going to earn money later, but because it is useful for something. That serves to improve some aspect of people's daily lives.
Likewise, if someone wants to invest in a ponzi, they can also do it. Everyone does what they want with their money. When I say ponzi is an example, I don't mean this. But I think that all the meme coins, shiba, doge, ghost, only serve as a casino, they are useless.

Of course! I try my best. Here are a couple more quick questions.

On the web site it says the total supply is 10 billion tokens, and of that, about 200 million has been burned. 
![Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 9.31.32 AM|689x413, 75%](upload://mSvxcLPIezduyT0DdlfdnJ89HXf.png)


When I hear the word "burned", I think that means those tokens have been removed from the total supply. But I see on the Twitter account that "**2% of the total [$GHOST](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GHOST&src=cashtag_click) (EXT standard) has been burned and this part will exist in the [#SNS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNS?src=hashtag_click) DAO.**"

![Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 9.32.47 AM|560x500, 75%](upload://bSD8cP7CYuZALARyo1KmjWjcKxk.png)

Does that mean that 2% isn't removed from the total supply of 10 billion? It is just moved somewhere else?

Also, if the entire 10 billion has been distributed already using this info from the site: 
![Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 9.47.46 AM|690x340, 75%](upload://64V1lVLPtbIb4sXisMeGW9r5tKF.png)

Where is this 20% of the total supply coming from? 

Last question, the team took 4.08% of the original 10 billion, and now the team will be taking 4.08% of this 2 billion? Thanks!

That's correct, swap participants do have the ability to increase their dissolve delay at any point after the launch. However, this process requires some time. Consequently, there will be a period immediately after the launch where the SNS is fully under the control of the single dev neuron. It's crucial that swap participants are thoroughly aware and conscious of this circumstance.

[/quote]
Other projects have taken advantage of the vesting period functionality for developer neurons. This approach creates an additional lock-in, demonstrating a tangible and long-term commitment from the developers without causing a substantial increase in their voting power.

Final note: Other projects have utilized the forum for pre-submission discussions, gathering community feedback, and fine-tuning parameters. This approach might have been beneficial in preventing vulnerable setups.

Given the chance of such decent funding, I'd love to get the group together to run a few more cash grabs. Let's make next e.g. ICSmurfs! Zero utility, 100% pump&dump.

Well, I am happy you aren't asking for 5mil$ in ICP.

[/quote]

That's an attack vector you probably want to take care of. Trust is not something you should be asking for. You can probably fix that by setting min 30 days dissolve delay for all tokens (that depends on the staking bonus). Otherwise, devs can create a proposal and nobody can react (If others stake their neurons after the proposal has been made, they can't participate in it)
Also, someone who buys >5% of the tokens will have more than devs and will be able to do that quickly. Basically few seconds after the swap is complete, they can have the treasury in their accounts.
That is basically a script that swaps for 5k ICP at most and a few sec later has 20k ICP and 80% of your new tokens.

There will probably be interest if you can clearly explain or prove a fair EXT token distribution and also how much of the new tokens will be given to EXT token holders. I am not getting it yet "A portion of it is allocated for a 1:1 exchange between GHOST (EXT) and GHOST (ICRC1)" How much is the portion? Even if you write a % now, why would the new DAO neurons vote for it later?

Saying that, I did get 20$ worth of GHOST airdropped to me by a friend, so you may have done a good job distributing it. But can you somehow prove it (at least approximately) and show us you don't own 90% of the EXT tokens?

Edit: Ugh, you already made the proposal to launch. Well, gl. I guess that's probably 180T cycles wasted.

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-07 01:20:18 UTC | #24

1. Indeed, we have already burned 2% of the GHOST in the EXT standard, and this proportion is still increasing. We have put these GHOSTs into the Treasury of the ICRC standard GHOST in the SNS, as we want to offer the community more options such as burning these tokens, using them as liquidity rewards, or as a part of the market expansion. The final decision on these will be entirely up to the community. Please remember, the total quantity of GHOST is only 10 billion, and what we are doing now is gradually converting the EXT standard GHOST to the ICRC standard GHOST. Of which, 73.92% of the GHOST in the Treasury will be used to exchange the currently circulating EXT standard GHOST in the market, and this part of the EXT GHOST will be burned and will no longer circulate in the market.

2. As for the source of this 20%, we have previously explained: These tokens come from various sources, including tokens allocated by the team for liquidity, repurchased tokens yet to be burned, market reserves that haven't been fully utilized, and tokens allocated for staking and liquidity rewards.

3. The original 4.08% of the EXT standard GHOST held by the team will be burned after the end of the SNS sale, including the part of the aforementioned 20%. After the end of the SNS sale, the circulating EXT in the market will only be 73.92%, and after being converted into ICRC standard tokens, it will be burned and can no longer circulate in the market.

GHOST | 2023-07-07 01:29:31 UTC | #25

Thank you for your continued interest and engagement with our project. Your questions and comments are invaluable to us and we greatly appreciate your active participation in these discussions.

We understand that some projects have set a vesting period for their developer neurons. However, not all strategies are universally applicable. In our case, we believe that setting a one-year dissolve delay for our developer neuron clearly manifests our long-term commitment to this project and to the community.

We have primarily utilized Twitter for our discussions, but we acknowledge the value of engaging more in pre-submission discussions on this forum to collect community feedback and fine-tune our strategies.

Regarding your concern about the immediate period after the launch where the SNS might be under the control of the single dev neuron, we'd like to reiterate that each voting process requires a period of 4 days, during which community members have ample time to participate and voice their opinions, including opposing any proposal that they perceive could be harmful to the community.

We always strive to maintain an open dialogue with our community and we are deeply grateful for contributors like you who help us keep our practices transparent, fair, and robust.

GHOST | 2023-07-07 01:49:55 UTC | #27

Thank you for your suggestions and questions. I would like to address them here. Regarding the distribution of GHOST's EXT tokens, we airdropped 51% of the tokens to our IC GHOST NFT holders a year ago and collaborated with numerous NFT projects within the ecosystem, distributing a large amount of GHOST to active users in the ecosystem. IC GHOST NFTs were also mostly airdropped to active users in the ICP ecosystem. You can check our Twitter account to get a glimpse of our airdrop history. I believe you would be fascinated by GHOST's journey. We have been striving to make GHOST one of the most decentralized tokens within the ecosystem, with the team holding only 4.08% of the tokens and never selling them. You can confirm this by checking our team's address.

Moreover, all proposals have ample time for voting, and I trust the community members will make the best decisions. I believe those investing in GHOST value the strength of the GHOST community, especially in the world of MEME Coins, where community is everything. GHOST is community-driven and community-led. We have faith that GHOST will establish a truly decentralized community and implement 100% on-chain governance through SNS.

Thank you again for your valuable feedback and suggestions, they are crucial for our development.

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-07 02:00:26 UTC | #28

We are incredibly grateful for your support and encouragement! Your words mean a lot to our team. We are passionate about the GHOST project and committed to creating value for the community. We will also respect every community member, as without you, there would be no GHOST. Thank you again for your affirmation and trust in our project, we will continue to work hard and look forward to creating more possibilities with you!

SNS should be kept for real functioning web 3 apps, that have value and the ability to champion the USP of the IC for the wider world. Real utility and vision

Not just some worthless meme token with a ghost on it, and some fancy marketing words around community building and the vision of satoshi. Seems like a money grab to me

These projects should be kept for Cig DAO.

Week_ICP1 | 2023-07-07 03:44:42 UTC | #32

I'm now really lost myself what is the core value for the community fund and SNS new dapp launch. One of the reason for me to jump into IC community deeply is because I believe this innovation will be positive and disruptive. 

However, up to now we haven't see any action from "community fund" to positively support evaluation on new SNS launch, but directly allocate huge amount of ICP to the launch with 0 communication with the members who joined the fund. If we regard "community fund" as a traditional VC, that's much worse communication with LPs comparing traditional VCs. This is what we don't like to see. Seems we still need to have "people" behind the code to better manage the outputs.
  
For SNS launch, the reason for people to join the launch is based on the trustiness: the reputation of IC community comparing other 3rd party launchpad. I'm here not for commenting on meme. but please take care of our community reputation which will impact the long term run instead of focus on certain party's short term profit.

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-07 03:45:57 UTC | #33

Thank you for sharing your views. While GHOST may seem like a "meme" token, it is, in fact, the beating heart of a vibrant and dedicated community. We have deep respect for Cig DAO, but we are unsure if it is still under the control of the Cig DAO team. Moreover, it does not align with our vision of absolute decentralization.

Over the past year, our community has ventured into developing DApps, which include but are not limited to GHOST-based gambling games and adventure games featuring GHOST NFTs. You can revisit these milestones on our Twitter page. We firmly believe that as we grow, our community's power will extend beyond being a mere meme token and evolve into a genuinely community-driven DAO along with an assortment of DApps.

The philosophy of SNS aligns seamlessly with GHOST's pursuit: Decentralization. We are confident that GHOST can contribute significantly to enhancing the activity and actual decentralized governance of SNS. Let's not underestimate the power and potential of GHOST in realizing the vision of SNS!

-------------------------

Sal_Paradise | 2023-07-07 04:49:14 UTC | #34

Thats all great et all but nowhere in the proposal have you outlined any sort of plans for the games you mentioned, what are they exactly. What are you going to build? From the first look, it looks like you're raising money for the community, and then start thinking of ideas after that. If a VC looked at this, there's no business plan, just an opaque idea loosely based around decentralisation. - would you say that's an investable product?

That's like saying, give me a million bucks and I'll think what to do with it afterward. Doesn't work that way

Unless you can propose something viable, it's a cash grab for token holders. Good luck with it, just don't abuse the SNS

The vulnerability is not mitigated by the 4-day voting period. Before the voting period ends, a proposal is adopted or rejected if an absolute majority has voted Yes or No on the proposal. Hence, the dev neuron could pass any proposal directly after the SNS launch.

gatsby_esp | 2023-07-07 09:18:38 UTC | #36

Why do SNS accept supposedly "flawed" proposals? If there is a know vulnerability in an specific configuration should be addressed by Dfinity Team to give back an error instead of accepting the proposal. 
Anyways, if GHOST team wanted to dump the whole supply on investors they could have done it for more than a year since launch.
Even if the team wanted to keep 10.000 ICP for their own sake after a year working on the project I would'nt have any complain about it lol

We explicitly made the GHOST team aware of the [SNS Launch Checklist](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/sns-checklist/) even before the first proposal. The checklist also references [DFINITY's voting guidelines and suggested minimum requirements](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinitys-voting-on-upcoming-sns-launch-proposals/19543).

There, it is mentioned (among other points) that the team should start a discussion on the forum at least 2 weeks before submitting the proposal in order to leave enough time for the community to read and deliberate on the proposal, and to allow the team to improve the proposal and SNS configuration accordingly.

[quote="bjoernek, post:1, topic:19543"] 
Syndication approach

* Careful syndication of the SNS proposal, including a motivation for the chosen tokenomics parameters in the proposal and SNS init file (e.g., in the form of a whitepaper).
* Post at least on [https://forum.dfinity.org/ ](https://forum.dfinity.org/), and ideally on further channels.
* The syndication (once all parameters are fixed) should last at least two weeks.

It is also explicitly mentioned that an analysis of the distribution of voting power at genesis should be provided.

In my opinion, this defect is also applicable to kinic and the developers of its projects. If the double standard treats ghost as evil to judge it unfairly, such sns will disappoint the community.

Manu | 2023-07-10 07:38:38 UTC | #41

I will vote to reject this one:
1. I'm worried about the zero dissolve delay problem that @bjoernek mentioned above
2. I still don't understand the relation between the EXT and ICRC ledger and what the real token supply is. 

Luckily, I think these concerns are easy to address, so I hope that you will address some of this feedback and resubmit an SNS proposal!

EDIT: just to clarify, this is how I vote with my personal neuron (which is also one of the neurons followed by synapse), but I don't speak for the foundation here.

-------------------------

caolw | 2023-07-07 12:56:06 UTC | #42

Do you veto this proposal, or does the foundation veto this proposal?

-------------------------

caolw | 2023-07-07 13:01:00 UTC | #43

That should be a question for the foundation to address, like what is the waiting time for voting? If there is a voting waiting time, users can lock themselves and then vote.

-------------------------

caolw | 2023-07-07 13:32:55 UTC | #44

ghost sns risk, inform investors can. Investors must bear the risk and the reward. Since we're not using the ICP from the community fund, the foundation should remain neutral.

-------------------------

charm | 2023-07-07 13:50:13 UTC | #45

1. In the opinion of the community, SNS does not need dissolve delay at all
2. EXT and ICRC tokens can be mapped 1:1, and can be replaced directly through the proposal

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-07 15:00:34 UTC | #47

Thank you for raising your concerns. I would like to address them point by point to ensure clarity.

Regarding the zero dissolve delay concern: Our intention is to offer tokens that do not require a mandatory lockup period. This aligns with mainstream practices in the blockchain industry, where token holders have the freedom to decide if they want to lock their tokens or not. Our commitment to decentralization is mirrored in this approach as we respect the choices and expectations of our community. To demonstrate our confidence in the project and our commitment to our community, our team has pledged to lock our tokens for a year, which signifies our promise not to act against the community's interest.

Concerning the relationship between the EXT and ICRC ledger and the real token supply: Our primary purpose of launching the SNS is to transition our existing EXT tokens into ICRC tokens issued by the SNS. This process is a crucial step towards achieving true decentralization and community-driven DAO governance. At present, our team controls the EXT Canister. However, with the SNS, we plan to transfer this control to the community.

As for the total supply, it remains unchanged at 10 billion GHOST tokens. The process we're implementing is merely a transition from EXT standard GHOST to ICRC standard GHOST. Specifically, 73.92% of the GHOST in the Treasury will be used to exchange the currently circulating EXT standard GHOST in the market. This portion of EXT GHOST will subsequently be burned and removed from market circulation.

At present, 2% of EXT standard tokens have been burned. The team-held 24.08% of EXT standard GHOST will be burned following the SNS sale. Post the SNS sale, only 73.92% of the EXT GHOST will remain in the market, which, upon conversion to ICRC standard tokens, will be burned and removed from market circulation. In the end, we will only have ICRC GHOST tokens in circulation.

We hope this explanation adequately addresses your concerns. We're looking forward to continuing to work towards true decentralization and community-driven governance with the support and insights from the community.

Since there is 0 funding requirement from the Neuron Fund, and users are made aware of the potential risk of a developer rug, if they still want to participate then let them!

We need meme tokens.

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2023-07-07 17:13:54 UTC | #50

I would like to point something out: This project market cap at ATH was about 3.5Million $. Yes, 3.5Million$. It is obvious that team did not rug then and have been around since over a year. So, do you think that their purpose is to rug 10k ICP ? Come on... If they need some I would provide them from my own pocket lol.

This applies to any project; 
let us, support ic, support ghost.
When I was worried, the robot appeared again, like sns1 and one person arranged all the tokens.If it happens, the ghost team should notify the community members as soon as possible, take preventive measures, and let the members hold tokens and immediately enter the snsdao pledge to prevent the robot from doing evil the next day.(If the robot pledges all his tokens, he will have a large number of votes the next day, which requires the gathering of community forces to prevent evil from happening😁).Partner, I believe ghost will be very great.

-------------------------

Bevis | 2023-07-08 17:03:25 UTC | #53

No community funds were used, and the potential risks were discussed to let the participants know that such SNS-W should not be opposed. In the case of notification, the potential participants should freely decide whether to participate or not.

plsak | 2023-07-09 16:55:46 UTC | #54

I have expressed my opinion on the  proposal configuration problem shortly after @bjoernek published the findings:
https://twitter.com/plsak/status/1677113886443544576?s=20

- Basically, if @GHOST wants to keep current setup, **the proposal and this topic** should be renamed to **`Proposal to create an SNS-CAO for IC GHOST`**, because the **Autonomous Organization won't be Decentralized** - not initially and possibly/probably not ever.

- `SNS1` also turned into CAO, but that was achieved via legitimate process - large investment from @borovan/buying..., which actually also **highly increased value of `SNS-1` tokens** in general (for those who didn't sell :crossed_fingers:).

  - **That is not the @GHOST case, here is only risk of compromising the CAO $ICP treasury, which could eventually lead to total colapse of $GHOST as well.**

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-07-10 06:50:23 UTC | #56

I agree with this point **"We need meme tokens"**

My concerns on Ghost is 

1. They didn't do any homework on tokenomics or SNS voting power economics
2. They don't have a WP or token paper.
3. In addition to this, I saw a potential for 51% attack (see below tip)

**MY 20K ICP TIP**: 
step 1: Arrange a bot to buy 100 ICP from 100 wallets during the nest second of launch. 
step 2: Stake all GHOST for 1 year, 
step 3: Put a proposal with name "STEAL V1" to transfer 20K ICP to your wallet. 
step 4: Rename Ghost to your GF/pet name.
step 5: PUMP PUMP PUMP.

The summary is that the community wanted to move forward with the project, but two whales (2 votes= 61Million --> 14% voting power!!! almost as Dfinity and 3x the foundation) emerged and altered the voting outcome. So, is this what decentralization looks like? Crazy

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-07-12 12:54:27 UTC | #60

This isn't normal decentralization. The IC's [Deterministic Decentralization](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Deterministic_Decentralization), even though less decentralized in theory, actually gives you better decentralization in practice.
The votes you write about were cast by neurons, which are followed (of their own free will) by smaller, distributed entities in order to speed up the decision-making process. Just like in the human nervous system, cooperation takes place here as well.

The only decentralization problem here is neuron 27 and its following by 99.3% of participants, which needs to be reset ONCE :slightly_smiling_face:

GHOST | 2023-07-12 13:49:31 UTC | #61

We wanted to take a moment to express our appreciation for the feedback and participation we've received from you all. We're truly humbled by the engagement and passion shown by our community.

We want to clarify that, while our second SNS proposal is still up for voting, we are constantly monitoring community feedback and evaluating potential improvements to our plans, should they be required. This is in no way an assumption of the outcome, but rather, it underlines our commitment to responsiveness and adaptability.

Considering your valuable feedback, if needed, we are contemplating certain modifications to our SNS parameters. These potential changes could include:

1. Adjusting the terms for the sold $GHOST in the SNS parameters from 100% immediate unlock to 50% immediate unlock and 50% locked for seven days, with voting rights.
2. Maintaining the team's 4.08% allocation locked for one year.
3. Altering the maximum participation amount from 100 ICP to 50 ICP, and the minimum participation number from 100 to 200 people.

We emphasize that these changes are tentative and will be made with your consent. Your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions are what drive this project, making it a truly community-led initiative.

Again, we appreciate your engagement and support for the GHOST project. Regardless of the outcome, we look forward to working with all of you in realizing our shared vision of a truly decentralized future.

Stay tuned, and keep on supporting!

after SNS, how much of the 75.92% of the national treasury will be provided for 1:1ext token exchange? To put it another way: remove 20% of SNS sales, 4.08% of team ownership, 2% of destruction, and the rest are all airdrops removed?

Hi @GHOST team

When reviewing potential staking configurations, it's essential to assess the resulting distribution of voting power at genesis and examine potential attack vectors. You can find useful tools for this purpose [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration).

Should you distribute tokens with very small dissolve delays to swap participants, there could be a potential risk of an attack, which might unfold as follows:

1. An attacker participates in the SNS swap.
2. Right after the swap's completion, the attacker elevates the dissolve delay of all their neurons to the maximum, thus acquiring 51% of the voting power (this depends on the amount of tokens bought by the attacker and the voting power of the other swap participants and the dev neuron(s)) 
3. The attacker then submits a proposal (e.g., transfer treasury funds) and instantly approves it using their majority voting power.

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-13 12:37:21 UTC | #69

Hi, @bjoernek 
Thank you for bringing up this important concern. We are carefully evaluating staking configurations and considering potential attack vectors. We appreciate your insights and are committed to ensuring a fair and secure voting process. Your feedback is valuable to us as we refine our proposals and implement necessary safeguards.

We remain dedicated to building a decentralized and community-driven ecosystem. Let's continue the dialogue and work together to shape the future of #Ghost. Thank you for your contribution and support!

GHOST | 2023-07-14 14:12:39 UTC | #72

Hey, GHOST fam and IC community.

Let us clarify the issue regarding voting power and team control in SNS.

Let's calculate the voting power ratios for the team and the community based on the community's voting choice of "Unlock 50%, lock 50% for 30 days."

We know that each neuron's voting power is calculated as the token value multiplied by the dissolve delay bonus multiplied by the age bonus. The dissolve delay bonus starts at 1x with zero dissolve delay and increases linearly up to 1.25x for neurons with the maximum 1-year dissolve delay. The age bonus starts at 1x at zero age and increases linearly up to 1.25x for the maximum 6-month age.

Therefore, at the moment when SNS ends, the team's voting power ratio would be 4.08% * 1.25 * 1.25 = 6.375%, while the community's voting power ratio would be 20% * 50% * 1 * 1 = 10%. (Note: We are using a dissolve delay bonus of 1 for 7 days, but in reality, the dissolve delay bonus for 30 days would be slightly higher, meaning the community's voting power ratio would be slightly higher than 10%.)

Additionally, the following four measures are in place to prevent the team from having complete control over SNS:

1/ Half of the tokens from the 20% allocation are unlocked, allowing users who wish to participate in GHOST governance to stake these tokens and obtain voting power. This would further expand the community's voting power ratio.

2/ After SNS is launched, the voting period for proposals is 4 days. It would be impossible for the team to control the entire community and carry out any malicious actions.

3/ After the exchange of EXT tokens for SNS tokens, token holders can obtain voting power by staking their tokens through the NNS, further diluting the team's voting power.

4/ After SNS goes live, the team has committed to proposing the transfer of the entire treasury funds to the GHOST/ICP liquidity pool. After this step, any malicious actions by the team would yield no benefits but result in the community abandoning us, which would be unwise.

Finally, we are urgently preparing proposals based on the recommendations and feedback from the DFINITY Foundation. We will launch the charge ASAP! We stand united with you!

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Your feedback is highly valuable to us!

I accidentally discovered that I have these ICGhost tokens on my Stoic Wallet (it's from some airdrop). After the sale will there be transfer announcements on your twitter or where?
I'd like to move this to NNS as this outdated wallet from Toniq Labs doesn't support anything new features since genesis.

-------------------------

GHOST | 2023-07-17 15:25:23 UTC | #76

I suggest that you keep it in your wallet for the time being. Wait until it can be exchanged for the ICRC standard, then deposit it into the NNS wallet.

Unfortunately, the view of the general public is the view of the user, users do not understand the behind the scenes, maybe a web3 project wants to develop technology, but the development of technology does not mean that the development team has observed the correct economic cases in the structure of the token... these mistakes Hurts investors... Top programmers in token development may make mistakes and risk all capital!

Now let's assume a token like GHOST that has a fair distribution and is popular with the community and has benefited from a valid DAO... This decentralized asset can target new goals such as web3 development and be on this path!

Keep trying GHOST
