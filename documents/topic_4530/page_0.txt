I've been trying to get the quickstart working, but the various dfx commands doen't seem to generate the necessary html page and css file required for the application.  When you deploy the canister locally, and then call it at `http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=xxx` instead of generating the web page, it just shows javascript messages and dialog boxes.

According to the quickstart, when you run `dfx canister install --all`, you're supposed to get a log that looks like 

     Installing code for canister explore_hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
    Installing code for canister explore_hello_assets, with canister_id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
    Authorizing our identity (pubs-id) to the asset canister...
    Uploading assets to asset canister...
      /index.html 1/1 (480 bytes)
      /index.js 1/1 (296836 bytes)
      /main.css 1/1 (484 bytes)
      /sample-asset.txt 1/1 (24 bytes)
      /logo.png 1/1 (25397 bytes)
      /index.js.map 1/1 (964679 bytes)
      /index.js.LICENSE.txt 1/1 (499 bytes)
     
What I get is just:

    Installing code for canister explore_hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
    Installing code for canister explore_hello_assets, with canister_id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
    Authorizing our identity (default) to the asset canister...
    Uploading assets to asset canister...


And then it just returns to the terminal prompt, apparently no assets uploaded.  Also there is no `index.html` or 'main.css` file in my hello-assets assets directory.  You can load the page at the appropriate url (http:localhost:8000/?canisterId=' but you don't get a page, you just get the javascript prompt
