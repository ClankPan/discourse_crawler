Neurons have information attached:
Psychology would suggest that the Neuron name choice, voting dedication and dissolve delay conviction tells us a lot about the unconscious, conscious on display!

Does The Fools Court and RawTech Venture show conviction or do they have a very good reason for dissolving and why then do the main neurons that so many follow show very low voting power where others and I not have included all the follow groups, 2 others here have much more voting power?

Yes, it could be that they have other neurons where most of their stake is but I find this unsettling but not sure way. 

I would like others opinion about or the real reason.

I created a new neuron and added 10 ICP to it so I could submit the `RegisterKnownNeuron` proposal.

I don’t think there’s much you can read into these numbers.

Hi @kvic i’m one of the voting members of The Fools’ Court and just wanted to address your question. The TFC neuron was created with a single ICP because this is the minimum required to stake and vote. The TFC neuron follows each of our voting members and votes when we’ve reached a majority decision.

As for the dissolve delay; we did this so that any funds locked in this neuron (from fundraisers, events, etc) could be released within a reasonable amount of time if/when we are able to migrate to a community controlled neuron in the future. 

Regarding the conviction of our members; I won’t speak for others, but I have over 3k ICP staked in 8 year neurons and a good amount more invested into various projects in the ecosystem.

I don't see your neuron in the followers list. Is this just the name of your neuron in your account for a day when you might want to submit a proposal on the NNS?

OK, thanks for the explanation.

I see, the neuron is not called RegisterKnownNeuron it's Paul young.

Yes, sorry, I misunderstood your question.

`RegisterKnownNeuron` is the proposal type.
