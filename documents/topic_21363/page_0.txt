The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals this Friday, 2023-07-14. DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals the following Monday.

## This Release

This release addresses the issue discussed in [this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/52-year-neuron-fixes/21301). In particular, (1) unexpectedly large NNS neuron age is reset, (2) merging of non-dissolving neurons (i.e., with positive dissolve delay) is re-enabled, and (3) recording of events for auditing purposes is added.

In addition, this release adds support for hotkeys to join or leave the Neuron Fund (previously known as the Community Fund).
