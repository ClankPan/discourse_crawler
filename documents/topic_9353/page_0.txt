If your building the generated rust project, you might get the message when you try to deploy to prod.

`Message bytes 2162089 is bigger than the max allowed 2097152`

as glinuxdev pointed out in dfinity-dev discord rust channel, you need to use this `ic-cdk-optimizer` to deploy to prod.

[Installing optimizer](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/rust-guide/rust-optimize.html)

./build.sh
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --package society_rs && \
 ic-cdk-optimizer ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rusthelloworld_rs.wasm -o ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rusthelloworld-rs-opt.wasm
```

dfx.json
```
"rusthelloworld": {
      "candid": "src/rusthelloworld/rusthelloworld.did",
      "package": "rusthelloworld",
      "type": "rust",
      "build": "./build.sh"
    },
```

Root Cargo.toml
```
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/rusthelloworld",
]

[profile.release]
lto = true
opt-level = 'z'
codegen-units = 1
```

These are the settings I use, if anyone has better settings, please let me know.
