Hello. I'm posting this here in hopes that one of you might help me figure out how to register a new NFT canister with DAB. We have several Plug users that would like to see their NFTs in their wallet. When I go to the [DAB Github Page](https://github.com/Psychedelic/dab) and and follow the registration link it just takes me to the Typeform homepage.

Does anyone know if it's still possible to register a new NFT canister with DAB? If so, how should I go about doing that?

Thanks!
