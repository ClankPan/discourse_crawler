Is there any ckBTC tutorial aimed at end users?

So for example a regular Bitcoin user learns how to move his BTC to the IC, and obtain ckBTC.

Also the other way around, how to take ckBTC and convert it back to BTC? 

I've been looking for such a tutorial for end users, but I can only see developer level docs.

Maybe you can look up this page https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/bitcoin ?
It shows all components of ckbtc, minter, ledger, etc.
You can get your own BTC address, update your BTC balance, transfer SATOSHI(basic unit of BTC) to a ledger address, then you can mint a ckbtc on IC network.

Thanks but that is useless for a normal retail user of Bitcoin.

For me it's pretty good, but we need something far more like a tutorial.

Ok, I get your points, so the Dfinity Team needs to make a new page(we can call ckbtc mint tutorial) for the common users to know how to mint a ckbtc on IC network.

NNS supports to deposit BTC directly, it's pretty straight forward.

1. login to NNS https://nns.ic0.app
2. select "my tokens" -> "ckBTC"
3. click "receive" button 
4. click "Bitcoin" tab, you can copy bitcoin address or scan QRcode
5. transfer bitcoin from your wallet to this address
6. wait for 12 confirmations, then the ckbtc balance will be shown in your wallet, if not, you can just click "refresh balance" button to manually mint ckBTC.

I haven't tried to convert ckBTC to BTC, but the function is clear, just need to send ckbtc to Bitcoin address by selecting "Bitcoin Network"

Thanks for taking the time to explain this!

This is what I meant by a tutorial, a short and sweet one!

I do have BTC so I would like to test it fully and document it for regular users too.

there is bounty out for this type of use for CKBTC: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-bnt-6-point-of-sale-payment-dapp/20814
when the bounty is completed by someone, the resulted app will be helpful..

they do have documentation for that:
this one contains a high level overview diagram of working:

Thanks for the links, I am familiar with those since those are written for developers.
