So I was perusing https://avjzx-pyaaa-aaaaj-aadmq-cai.raw.ic0.app/icsns/proposals/zfcdd-tqaaa-aaaaq-aaaga-cai/43 sns proposal page and proposal ID #43 caught my eye. 

And it seems the this ICPCoin.com concept in the proposal is a direct copy of a charting suite (canister ID es3he-kyaaa-aaaah-abzna-cai) project that was launched in January and has been in development but road blocked by dexs not sharing APIs for live price action. 

While I appreciate people building on the ic, what concerns me is if this particular project will receive assistance from Dfinity or maybe even access to certain subnets. 
 It would be a shame if an sns proposal project would gain “over the top” access to token information in real time that developers whom don’t associate with sns cannot get. I only bring this up because of the current thread about ckbtc and kyt processing through toniq (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-and-kyt-compliance/18754/173?u=theguy) and how there seems to be some differing opinions on a single project receiving coordination w core team. 


in order for the network and community to gain usage it should be of the uptmost import that the network providers create a level playing field for all projects and not pick and choose who can or cannot succeed.
I would love to here some opinions on this.
