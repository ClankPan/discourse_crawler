I want to know whether the DFINITY team has plans to cooperate with some companies to issue stable coins in the Internet Computer ecosystem? Stable coins are essential for the Internet Computer ecosystem, especially the DeFi.

Cylces can lead to long-term negative premiums and do not function as stable coins.

Anyone can convert ICP into Cycles at any time, so this will lead to a constant increase in Cycles. There are two options for developers who need Cycles, one chooses to buy them, and the other chooses to convert them into Cycles with ICP themselves. When the price of 1T Cycles is higher or equal to 1 XDR, developers will choose to convert ICP into Cycles themselves, and only when 1T Cycles is sufficiently smaller than 1 XDR, developers will choose to buy Cycles. So 1T Cycles in the value of the market will be lower than 1 XDR for a long time, and even in the case of not many projects, the liquidity for purchase will be insufficient.

> When the price of 1T Cycles is higher or equal to 1 XDR, developers will choose to convert ICP into Cycles themselves, and only when 1T Cycles is sufficiently smaller than 1 XDR, developers will choose to buy Cycles. So 1T Cycles in the value of the market will be lower than 1 XDR for a long time, and even in the case of not many projects, the liquidity for purchase will be insufficient.

As long as the market price of cycles is below 1 XDR (minus DEX fees), there will be buyers. I imagine there will one day be DeFi services that make it extremely easy for developers to purchase cycles on the open market, perhaps even easier than converting ICP to cycles. As long as developers need to burn cycles to run their apps, the price of a cycle will tend towards 1 XDR.

Dom's Medium [post](https://medium.com/dfinity/announcing-internet-computer-mainnet-and-a-20-year-roadmap-790e56cbe04a) has a great explanation:

> On the Internet Computer, as it turns out, cycles will tend toward constant value, without need for a stablecoin scheme, thanks to the ongoing computation performed upon the network. First of all, the network allows users to convert ICP utility tokens they hold into cycles at a rate that is set by the NNS. The conversion rate will be anchored to IMF SDRs, which are made up from a basket of major fiat currencies, such that ICP utility tokens judged to be worth 0.65 SDR on external markets (which currently is very roughly equivalent in value to a Swiss franc or a US dollar) can be converted into 1 trillion cycles. Clearly, this provides a ceiling on the value of cycles, as nobody would ever buy them at a higher price, as they could simply buy ICP utility tokens and convert them into cycles themselves. But what about the floor? What happens if someone buys a large volume of cycles, for example, and then decides that they do not need them, making them available for sale? Here things get interesting! Such sellers must price their cycles below the ceiling, reducing the price. Consequently, those that wish to acquire cycles to power computation, either directly or by reselling them to others, will purchase them because they are cheaper. Naturally, these cheaper cycles will eventually all be removed from the market and burned by computations performed on the Internet Computer such that they disappear, and new cycles must be created from ICP utility tokens once again, returning their value to the ceiling. For this to be true, it is only necessary that the Internet Computer continue performing computations.

In the beginning, cycles will probably not be stable. In the long run, I think it's totally possible they become stable, once enough developers start using IC.

Pwoseidon | 2021-11-02 13:04:56 UTC | #13

Yea, this is fundamental and written into ICP, making it a kind of stable coin. It’s quite genius actually because it’s a sort of stable coin, just without anything to make the SEC perk up! (I think/hope)

-------------------------

BHare1985 | 2021-11-03 00:23:20 UTC | #14

If https://www.wtctoken.com/ and https://dank.ooo/xtc/ are used as a "stable coin" in DeFi/NFT markets or the like, then many users will hold cycles with the only intent on selling it for fiat. Hopefully, there is more demand for compute than people who want to use IC in general but I expect there to be far more end-users of IC than dapp devs. This is especially true with NFTs and the IC demand right now, one of these NFTs could blow up and millions of USD worth of cycles will flood the market.

In this regard, cycles can easily be dictated by supply/demand like any other commodity and not truly stable to fiat (which is what you want if you like decentralization, but that's another topic). Real stable coins have an almost-equal demand on buying and selling, whereas 1T cycles has an unbalanced demand so it won't stay stable according to its peg. The need for a real stable coin is present, otherwise, the cost of 1T cycles may approach extremely low prices and node providers can't be compensated properly, or at least not as they would expect (but Dfinity has a lot of eager people willing to take less profit)

-------------------------

Pwoseidon | 2022-01-27 06:56:38 UTC | #15

I can foresee dApps charging users cycles to access certain features.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-23 15:20:44 UTC | #16

It's likely easier / less problematic for existing fiat transfers to go directly to cycles since cycles themselves cannot be directly converted back into a different cryptocurrency that can be liquidated. Or at least, this might make it easier for Stripe for instance to enable direct fiat payments to ICP based dapps.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-23 15:26:18 UTC | #17

Likely the best user experience is one that is "at least agnostic" to the underlying currency, whatever it is. That is, a user should be able to pay a subscription fee with their native token fiat or not which would then unlock availability of access of the dapp they want to use. Theoretically a company should be able to provide refund (at a cost) in the form of the user's native token for the preferred experience of full auditability.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-23 15:34:13 UTC | #18

Finally I want to just say that given what's happened recently, now is a great time for decent stable coins to emerge that are either all or in part based on the IC. The key is remembering that no single person should have been capable of making a decision that would tank the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem: that is to say, while there are still problems, UST should have been explicitly governed by a DAO itself, as no single person then could have been capable of making a decision costing cryptocurrency much legitimacy and hundreds of billions of dollars in valuation while some "other people" were able to profit millions from betting against their smart contract collateralized loans. 

In any case my point was that stable coins are so new with so much potential, conceivably they could even be used to stabilize the speculative inflation of real estate value, although at that point I certainly hope there is enough technical functional literacy and available accessibility they don't become another tool making less instead of more possible.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-24 16:15:05 UTC | #19

In case anyone has an interest in this, Terra recently just voted on their path forward. Might be a good time to develop cross chain connections, as likely Terra's new go at it could benefit from the IC, and it looks like dapp developers will be rewarded directly from the ecosystem at it's launch:

Terra is dead imo, better not waste time with them.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-24 20:24:57 UTC | #23

Capital control is needed if we really want to see xtc as an sdr pegged currency, like a vault within dank stake necessary overminted xtc into dank,  reward back with dank protocol token, using dank yield as like interest rate within Federal reserve to control the price of xtc (exemple)

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-24 20:22:42 UTC | #24

Solve the overminted xtc + increase in TVL and also the burn within the ICP, since it will then incentivize people to burn more ICP either within sonic or other dex

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-24 20:22:52 UTC | #25

The parabolic burn of ICP started with this after the launch of sonic but then slowing down after the malfunctioning of our stable coin n went up and down with the price and volatility of the ICP,

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-24 20:24:19 UTC | #26

Because demand from devs alone is not enough to maintain the 1,35 pegged to the IMF as we have alr seen since then

Whoa, that's significantly under the USD price of 1 SDR, which is above $1. I guess I should be buying up these cheap cycles then...?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-25 00:51:02 UTC | #33

That depends on your belief how the USD/SDR pair is going to behave in the future; if you are not concerned about ICP prices(because you are buying "naked" cycles). 

Remember that only real conversion is from ICP to Cycles; with 1 T Cycles = 1 SDR.

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-25 04:13:27 UTC | #34

but what you gonna do with that if it drop even more and that's I think is the problem that requires capital control, over necessary minted xtc need to go somewhere that has real intime demand like DEFI for exemple, dank and psychedelic need to act like a federal reserve imo

Cycle pegged to sdr goal is to make ICP as a cheap place to build but what if the price of that pegged keep going up and down with the volatility of ICP like that then all the promise also be gone too because imagine one day the price of ICP goes up to 10k per coin.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-25 04:14:53 UTC | #35

I believe that UST depeged because it was a single trick pony show. Cycles have different use cases that makes use of (or should make of) storage, compute & composability (network) through different dapps. If we accomplish this through Supernova even at a miniscule level, then cycles has a viable option of being a "stable" coin; but linked to storage, compute, network etc. This is a paradigm shift because it is not stable against fiat (i.e. USD) or basket of fiat(i.e. SDR). It is "stable" against compute needs ; exactly where we want it positioned (compete with AWS, GCP etc in a totally decentralized way). CYCLES are also not actually stable; but totally deflationary in the long run because of Moore's law

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-25 04:22:53 UTC | #36

But it was designed to be pegged and stable and I think devs demand alone is not enough if we keep on minting trillions of cycle like that because its now control by the market through AMM

ICP gonna have an ethereum problem if we keep laissez faire on the price of cycle and the depegged of xtc btw was way before the ust problems

Xtc need to be stable if we want to see a stable cheap compute fuel and the flourishing of the Defi ecosystem of the ICP like awhole lots of protocol could be build if the price of xtc stay within the pegged like lending borrowing for exemple

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-25 04:22:45 UTC | #37

I would respectfully disagree. The only real conversion is between ICP (measured in SDR) to cycles. Since price of ICP keeps on changing, i would submit that cycles were never expected to be stable against fiat (usd) or basket of fiat (SDR).

-------------------------

ggf2134 | 2022-05-25 04:29:29 UTC | #38

Then we will no longer see a cheap blockchain within the ic if one day the price ICP hit above 10k and what the point of having cycle when we can just use the main unstable commodity like ICP to pay for computing system n that was the reason why I think we got 2 currency within the ic, cycle had alr lost it purpose.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-25 04:32:10 UTC | #39

Why would you say that ? A 10k icp would fetch a A LOT MORE cycles. To give you a perspective, i have a stack of ICP at an average price of $30 USD. My high price was $60. At $60. I converted some of ICP to fund the development of my canisters (equivalent i suppose to paying someone in BTC for pizza some 10 years ago). At 10k, i would be able fund a lot more out of my stack. 

Even if you buy at then current price of 10k, you would have lot more cycles. Assuming you reach that price in 5 years, what the cycles would be able to do would also expontentially increase (Moore's law)

hundreds of trillions of assets classes even potentially one day sucking up both equity and debt market into the system just like the credit market created by the medici during the Renaissance n complete change the world after that and I think it's the trade of the century because crypto is macro and icp is the choice of mine

but it's 10k and it's expensive we can just use the ICP as the main computing currency n delete cycle from the ICP,

I went through the article on action stream here(https://forum.dfinity.org/t/thought-provoking-must-read-pieces-on-web3/13218) by @jzxchiang . It was completely mind-shifting for me.

 I realized that Web3 brings as much if not more changes that the Renaissance did a few centuries ago. I view, now, Internet Computer & ICP as a means to an end and not end to itself.

[EDIT1: to give context to the mindshift, the paper mentions how one can have decentralized UNDERCOLLATERIZED loans by expanding on building blocks of non-transferable tokens. Currently all virtually all defi loans are overcollaterized.]

Sorry I meant that as to motivate more general regard to cross-chain integration than terra specifically.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-25 20:25:13 UTC | #43

This is one of the major hurdles crypto needs to deal with: mapping to real world equity. Otherwise it can too easily just be "another rugpull" that too obviously is benefiting those in the know at everyone's expense.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-25 22:02:07 UTC | #44

Personally, I think the first killer use case of web3 will involve purely virtual goods that have value but aren't in the "real world". I'm not sure we have to tokenize a physical asset to get to the promised land.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-26 19:10:16 UTC | #45

What's to stop a "purely virtual good" from being a speculative catastrophe?

Moreover, if web3 isn't used for the real world what's the point? So users who already have the luxury of being capable of connecting can further remove themselves from the real world? 

That kind of exclusionary digital utopianism is just as bad as the real thing, imho.

In case I misread your original intent, could you provide an example of a "purely virtual good" that has value but not in the real world?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-28 07:41:15 UTC | #46

I mean, not just goods but also services.

For example, this forum is a virtual service that provides tangible value to the people who use it. It exists purely in cyberspace and is currently hosted and moderated by DFINITY. However, I imagine that one day in the not-so-distant future a forum like this would be decentralized and tokenized. The hard part is figuring out what that tokenomics actually looks like IMO.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-31 19:22:51 UTC | #48

We actually do agree on this, I've had a couple of ideas that have little to do with financial value assets and more to do with what decentralized blockchain can do. 

One of the problems is that web3 ≘ crypto ≘ rugpulls, and if blockchain technology can't be a way to resolve some of this kind of issue, it very much fails the test of hypocriticality: why is "virtually immutable DLT" "so unable" to even deal with the rampant fraud its own technology has brought into reality? Obviously it's more complicated than that, but as a kind of reality check if we can derive web3 solutions to overcome that kind of abuse of another's assets/value, it would probably go far in terms of inspiring confidence in the "rest of the world"/everyone still on web2. 

This gets to why I originally brought up stable coins--is if web3 can be used to "make money smart" then couldn't be used to make valuations of real world assets more reliable? more consistent? Less obfuscated? Particularly, for instance, when it comes to the valuation of real estate... a stable coin that could normalize/stabilize real estate prices would likely be quite a challenge, but could be such a good example of the power of web3 (got to admit that "we're" still so far off from anything like that, realistically). 

And if web3 technology could indeed "make money smarter", it would certainly help defeat the currently popular stereotypes that web3 is just crypto which is just unregulated finance used by criminals (which is a very, very real belief many people have). 

Anyways what I wanted to reply with was that likely pne of the easiest ways to approach tokenomics is by appreciating the user as a point of departure. Specifically if the tokenomics can be "crowd sourced" then actually creating the tokenomics can itself be tokenized, which would also more naturally reflect the way decentralized are supposed to independently work. That being said, there was an economist who once defined the concepts of "use value" and "exchange value" where the use value of a thing is the value realized in that thing's consumption, whereas the exchange value of a thing is a specific case of use value in which the use realized is the value obtained from transacting/trading that thing: in fact, this is what makes a commodity a commodity, since the use value of whatever thing can be transformed by the application of its exchange in the profit derived from trading that commodity, so that any use value becomes realized as exchange value which is what turns a widget/product into a more abstract commodity (since all commodities are evaluated by the same basis of cost, the currency used to exchange that thing).

Sorry that's more unclear than what I'd have liked, but I bring it up because even if you don't agree with the author of the idea, it's a useful distinction when thinking about how "tokenization" happens in existing fiat markets... and how "tokenization" can work in extending either the use value of a thing or it's exchange value, or both when it comes to users making those kinds of decisions when using web3.

-------------------------

inviscidpixels | 2022-05-31 19:25:09 UTC | #49
