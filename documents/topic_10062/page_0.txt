I deploy a rust canister with candid. I call it in command, it return a right message. Like this: 
![image|690x168](upload://9azNYyD4o8K4E1XoaDkmV8ORAHF.png)

But when I call it in motoko, it return a error message: Canister xxx trapped explicitly: IDL error: unexpected variant tag
How can I fix this bug?

Maybe the Motoko canister is calling that other canister with a wrong type, i.e. the result type as assumed by Motoko is not the type of the response as actually sent by the canister.

BTW, `17_724` is `Ok`, with an upper case `O`. If you are trying to to read this using [Motokoâ€™s `Result` type](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/base-libraries/result), then this will fail, as the latter is using `ok` as the tag name.

Yes, the rust Result is different from the motoko Result.
Thanks! :star_struck:
