Hello everyone, first time posting on this forum so sorry if I break some rules about posting here. 
So, since the number of new tokens on SNS is increasing, I think it would be good if we had the option to filter tokens using the checkbox for example so that only those where we have an active neuron are shown. Because some people have, for example, two active neurons and have to scroll through the list to find their neurons among other tokens. I think this small change would improve NNS a bit. 

I wonder what do you guys think about this?
