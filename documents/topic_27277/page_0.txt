When I enter "https://hs4zk-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx.icp0.io/" to check my wallet, it requires me to execute : dfx canister --network ic call "hs4zk-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx" authorize '(principal "gtndg-4cf5m-aaems-ap74c-ien4q-***********")'. But when I truly follow the order, it just keeps reporting error.

```

chris@JJ-laptop:~$ dfx canister --network ic status "hs4zk-xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx"

How should I deal with this problem? Any help will be appreciated.

What wallet do you have this error with?

This is about the cycles wallet

`subnet_not_found`

This tells me that you may be mixing up principals somehow. And the CLI log you show contains very different principals from the one you originally pasted with the instructions. You shouldn't need to do more than simply copy/paste the command you see in the browser into your command line
