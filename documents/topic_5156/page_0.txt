NOT Financial Advice, I am not a financial adviser.

When the Maturity * ICP = 100, i get the ability to spawn a new neuron. When that occurs (because that event is potentially taxable for me in USA) regardless of whether I choose to spawn the neural or not, I would like to record that event with the price immutably. Is there a way to do this?
