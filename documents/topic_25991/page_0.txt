I am not getting expected responses when testing [Ic-siwe](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-siwe-sign-in-with-ethereum-support-libraries-for-ic/25306) locally. I am testing that expiration and delegation targets works as expected. 

Issues:
- Expired delegate identities can still be used for calls
- Calls coming from invalid target canisters are accepted

I haven't dug deep into this yet, maybe it is an error at my end, but just wanted to check, does PocketIc fully support delegate identity expirations and targets?

> does PocketIc fully support delegate identity expirations and targets

No, PocketIC doesn't support identity delegations (and their targets and expiration), but they'll be enabled as part of the next item on the PocketIC roadmap.

Another thing I noticed, the `Result<Output, CallError>` is not returned when calling `install_canister`. It would be good to be able to catch an error where a canister is installed with the wrong init arguments. And I guess that error ends up there?

**Edit:** I learnt that you can use `#[should_panic]` in tests to catch the panic created by installing a wasm with wrong (or no) init arguments. That solves my issue.
