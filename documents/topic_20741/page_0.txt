Good day! After 6 months of work, I've finally finished the demo for my project Decentrobe. This is an business system for creating authenticity certificates through NFT's. This could be used for reselling of goods and services, logistical solutions, and future ERP and CRM applications. Attached is the link to my Dapp. Feel free to contact me and give comments regaurding the software. TYSM!
