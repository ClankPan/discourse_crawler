 [EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)  Introduces a new transaction format for “blob-carrying transactions” which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed. 

Blobs have a more rigid pricing model than transaction calldata: you can only buy data in chunks of 131072 bytes.  This means that if the blob data is not to be completely and inefficiently dominated by a maximum of 6 rollups there is a need for a marketplace or multiplexer service which allows data to be bought and committed in smaller chunks.

At [Devconnect Istanbull Dapplion and team sketched out a multiplexer service design](https://hackmd.io/@dapplion/blob_sharing ) that could combine commitments from different users (typically rollup sequencers).

However the catch is that the design is off chain and needs a trusted party or trusted hardware. 

The internet computer would be well placed to fufill the role of trustless multiplexer and this not only cement a role for the ICP within the ethereum ecosystem, but also position it to be an integration point for all ethereum rollups (since committed data could be read by the canister).
