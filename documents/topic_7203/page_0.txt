I am preparing a talk about the Internet Computer right now, and am stuck a bit explaining how the boundary nodes actually work internally, so I checked https://github.com/dfinity/ic, but unless I am mistaken I cannot find boundary-node related code there.

Is the code (custom software and configuration) for the boundary nodes already public?

Now that the IC code dump is more complete, I _believe_ this is the code for the boundary node:

https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/ae9d6adfe71451fc1a25c5c3be073f402fb8c980/testnet/ansible/roles/icos_test_boundary_node

But the `testnet` in the path confuses me. Maybe @ianblenke can clarify?

Did you ever find the code?

Itâ€™s a bit all over the place, but I think one can find the relevant pieces here:

* https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/testnet/ansible/roles/boundary_node
* https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/boundary_node/control_plane
* https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/ic-os/boundary-guestos

Hello Joachim, sorry for the delayed response.  We have ongoing work under the boundary node decentralization effort, so quite a few things will change in the immediate future.

Please refer only to the following folder 
https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/ic-os/boundary-guestos
(other parts may end up being merged or deprecated )
