I have the following error:
```

Isnâ€™t isController brand new? As of moc 0.9.1?

Dfx 0.14.0 bundles with an older moc. You might need to install the latest moc binary and set the DFX_MOC_PATH environment variable when calling dfx build.

An alternative solution is to edit `package-set.dhall`:
```
  overrides =
    [
      { name = "base"
      , repo = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base"
      , version = "moc-0.9.0"
      , dependencies = [] : List Text
      },
    ] : List Package
```

But is that enough? In package-set.dhall you specify the version of motoko-base, not of the compiler. I thought that you probably need compiler support for isController to work because it uses a new syscall `ic0.is_controller`. But maybe I'm wrong. Just guessing, I haven't tried any of this myself.

Yes, @timo is correct, support for `ic0.is_controller` was only added in `moc v0.9.1`.
https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/releases/tag/0.9.1

@qwertytrewq you would need at least version `0.9.1` of both the compiler and the base package.
The `DFX_MOC_PATH` env variable allows you to do this, so you do not need to wait on a DFX release.
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-deploy-with-custom-motoko-version/7665

DFX `v0.14.0` only comes with `Motoko compiler 0.8.7`.
