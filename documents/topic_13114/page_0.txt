As we can see here, `ic-cdk` re-exports some library functions, mainly `candid` and `serde`.

I think if those crates are necessary for using `ic-cdk`, it would be much clearer to let canister developers import `candid` or `serde` directly by themselves.
1. When you want to use `ic-cdk`, you still have to import `candid` and `serde` in most cases.
2. And it's annoying the compiler throws errors when you want to use only `candid` (I'm not sure if this is a bug of the rust compiler):

`[dependencies]` of `ic00_types` should only need `candid`, and `ic-cdk` is not imported in reality, but there are a lot of strange errors:

Since the open source of the ic repo in May last year, when importing the library of the ic repo as a dependency into other projects, I have often received this problem.

Thereâ€™s a note somewhere which says:

> Note that if you are using the Rust CDK to develop Rust canisters, it is encouraged to use the Candid crate from `ic_cdk::export::candid` to avoid version mismatch.
