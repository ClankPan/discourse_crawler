Is it possible to determine whether principal is internet identity from a canister? Any example code as well (motoko specifically)?

Hi @Iceypee 

It is not possible to determine from a principal if it belongs to Internet Identity. However, you could send along the delegation public key which contains the II canister id as per [specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#canister-signatures).

Unfortunately, I don't have a Motoko example at hand that shows how to do that. But here is some Rust code that shows how to extract the canister id from the public key: https://github.com/dfinity/ic-canister-sig-creation/blob/bb1bf7c4114190b1b754a85847d1a7040358184d/src/lib.rs#L42

I hope this helps.
