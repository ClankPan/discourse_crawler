Is there an API in Motoko similar to the Rust API ic_cdk::trap? ic_cdk::trap can explicitly propagate the error message to the client, and the state changes before trap are reverted.

There is `throw Error.reject("xxxx")` in Motoko, but the state changes before it are not reverted.

No, but there should be. You can trap with `assert false`, but not lass a message.

Might actually be a good newcomer's tasks for anyone wanting to get involved with Motoko.
