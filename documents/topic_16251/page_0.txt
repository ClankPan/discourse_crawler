Dear All,

I think that internet identity should have only one identification in all the platform.

When we login in infinity swap wallet with internet identity and other side with stoic wallet but there principal and account id are different even though we have same internet identity login for stoic wallet.

I suggest, We have all to be same

Like

One anchor = one wallet id in all the platform = same content= same login consideration

Single login in all the platform with same content to display

It is to prevent people tracking you a d knowing all the places you log in to.

You are write but i dont find any difficulties in tracking.
Even people track you but the blockchain security is almost strong to overcome phishing.

protection is just a bonus. not being trackable has many practicle uses, for both the dev ans mostly the user
