Hi - I'm just curious, does DFINITY post a list of CAP awardees like they do for the dev grant?

Is it located somewhere else that I'm just not seeing? Here is a link to the [CAP application page](https://dfinity.org/community).

Edit: I updated the title to be less accusatory and more inquisitive. I believe this better reflects my intent.

Good question. Thatâ€™s good feedback. Let me find out more.

I know about this page: https://dfinity.org/grants that lists a bunch, but as I'm not from a related team I'm not sure what _exactly_ this covers.

Hi Diego, I know this is low priority (rightly so) but I was wondering if you had anything more to share regarding my question. I think it would be good for everyone to know who is receiving these community awards and for what reasons.
